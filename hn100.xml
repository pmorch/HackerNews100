<p>There’s a reason video games build what’s called a ‘vertical slice’.  If you’re not familiar, a vertical slice is a single playable area, with all mechanics, final art, vfx, sfx, music, etc.  Basically, a little piece of exactly how the finished game will look and feel and play.  The vertical slice is what game developers show publishers and investors to demonstrate not only that the game itself is going to be good, but also that the game development team has all the skills necessary to deliver the game to the level of polish the market demands.</p>



<p>Contrast this with the tech industry, which submits for approval an ‘MVP’.  A minimum viable product is the absolute least one can create that someone will pay for.  It seems tech investors have gotten very used to evaluating MVPs, and rightly so — they need to be able to assess the potential of these prototypes so they can decide which are worth their investment.  The problem is that MVPs don’t actually establish whether the team /could/ get to a finished product, and in practice many can’t.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.trustedreviews.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F54%2F2017%2F12%2FMagic_Leap_One-920x470.jpg&amp;f=1&amp;nofb=1&amp;ipt=a9962e376cfc5425f10e77c8b0f406304a4f24d69bf21bd1e44bb6bff9c96156&amp;ipo=images" alt=""></figure>



<p>Recently, getting VC funding has become such an end in itself that engineers in the tech industry, centered around Silicon Valley, have optimized their skillset for prototyping.  There’s an oft quoted idea called the Pareto Principle, which states that 20% of the effort produces 80% of the results.  So, if you can just prioritize the right 20%, you can get most of the way towards the desired outcome.  The whole sector has become great at this, nearly to the exclusion of all else.  And who can blame them?  Look at the inverse — doing 80% of the work to complete only 20% of the job doesn’t sound like much fun.</p>



<p>What the Pareto Principle doesn’t capture, and what its adherents seem to forget, is that you still HAVE TO DO that last 20%.  End users usually don’t enjoy using 80% of a website, or driving 80% of a car.  Unfortunately, with so many digital products abandoned at the funding stage or forced to release early, engineers and designers often don’t have any practice with the last 80% of the effort required to finish something.  I’ve worked with many such engineers, and it can be really sad knowing that you can never get to the level of polish the concept deserves.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fupload.wikimedia.org%2Fwikipedia%2Fcommons%2Fthumb%2F9%2F93%2FTesla_Cybertruck_and_Cyberquad_for_kids.jpg%2F440px-Tesla_Cybertruck_and_Cyberquad_for_kids.jpg&amp;f=1&amp;nofb=1&amp;ipt=2006be94bbdadbfc03d551487cd1befe75cd9602814c25db4dbc35905215dc48&amp;ipo=images" alt=""></figure>



<p>Because there is such a culture around early adoption of new technology, there’s a big population willing to overlook that the things they use are unfinished.  It’s good that there are folks willing to try out nascent products, but we don’t need those products lionized, nor the people who use them.  Because of their approval, the broader population has begun to defend the truncated.  This applies to games as well.  Day 1 patches are the norm, as are DLC which feels like it ought have been part of the core game.  When products remain incomplete it’s often because all potential customers have already paid and there’s no financial incentive to finish.  How many of the products you use every day feel like they needed a few more iterations to really work correctly?</p>



<p>However, there is another, more frustrating reason why a product might remain unfinished.  Maybe it’s literally impossible to complete.  I think that’s the situation we find ourselves in for certain applications of AI, like self-driving cars, image generation, and text generation.  Even people who advocate for these technologies rarely assert that the results are useable as-is, especially in a world where people are accustomed to a much higher, human-level quality.  At best they are useful as a starting point for a human to then finish the image, or the cover letter, or to take the wheel.  The problem is I don’t think that the current methodology is capable of taking us the other 80/20% of the way.  </p>



<p>I’ll break from my main point briefly to justify that assertion.  It’s funny to think about now, but in the 70s, AI researchers believed they were most of the way towards achieving AGI (artificial general intelligence, aka the AI from the movies).  They thought that if an expert system, or a perceptron, or a set of predicates was just developed far enough they would eventually reach sentience, or at least eliminate tedious work.  Many believed that the hardware explosion Moore’s law promised was enough to create AI, and the software would take care of itself.  Some of that was true — expert systems handle things like WebMD, and constraint solvers manage the incredible logistics of modern freight.  The limits of the techniques of the time weren’t felt until much later.  That’s where we are with Generative AI, too.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FgMsQO5u7-NQ%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg&amp;f=1&amp;nofb=1&amp;ipt=fdd2997108e811fdb42b21739ed07fbd74c16bde959eb62ee35ab44bde2c1d04&amp;ipo=images" alt=""></figure>



<p>I think that the Pareto Principle is technically true in a lot of fields, but I also feel our society would be a lot better off if we didn’t know about it.  As I said, doing the last 80% of the work to produce only the final 20% of the result is hard on morale.  It’s no wonder  that work is so often abandoned, or outsourced.  Perhaps more investors should demand to see a vertical slice, instead.</p>



<p>If we took a more craftsmanlike view of software, we would realize that a chair is not 80% done when you can sit on it.  It’s the details and the polish that make something worthy of use.  So while from a utilitarian standpoint something may have most of the features a person might ask for, from a humanist point of view 20% of the work still only produces 20% of the results.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h5>Martin Nally</h5><p>Software Developer and API designer, Apigee</p></div><div jsname="tx2NYc"><section><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p>As most software developers no doubt know, there are two primary models for API design: RPC and REST. Regardless of model, most modern APIs are implemented by mapping them in one way or another to the same HTTP protocol. It has also become common for RPC API designs to adopt one or two ideas from HTTP while staying within the RPC model, which has increased the range of choices that an API designer faces. This post tries to explain the choices, and give guidance on how to choose between them.</p><p>gRPC is a technology for implementing RPC APIs that uses HTTP 2.0 as its underlying transport protocol. You might expect that gRPC and HTTP would be mutually exclusive, since they are based on opposite conceptual models. gRPC is based on the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) model, in which the addressable entities are procedures, and the data is hidden behind the procedures. HTTP works the inverse way. In HTTP, the addressable entities are “data entities” (called “resources” in the HTTP specifications), and the behaviors are hidden behind the data—the behavior of the system results from creating, modifying, and deleting resources.</p><p>In fact, many of the APIs created here at Google and elsewhere combine RPC with a few ideas from HTTP in an interesting way. These APIs adopt an entity-oriented model, as does HTTP, but are defined and implemented using gRPC, and the resulting APIs can be invoked using standard HTTP technologies. We will try to describe how this works, why it might be good for you, and where it might not.</p><p>Let's first take a closer look at how HTTP is commonly used for APIs.</p><h2>The three primary ways to use HTTP for APIs</h2><p>Most public APIs and many private distributed APIs use HTTP as the transport, at least in part because organizations are accustomed to dealing with the security issues of allowing HTTP traffic on ports 80 and 443.</p><p>In my opinion there are three significant and distinct approaches for building APIs that use HTTP. They are:</p><ol><li><p>REST</p></li><li><p>gRPC (and Apache Thrift and others)</p></li><li><p>OpenAPI (and its competitors)</p></li></ol><h3>REST</h3><p>The least-commonly used API model is REST—only a small minority of APIs are designed this way, even though the word REST is used (or abused) more broadly. A signature characteristic of this style of API is that clients do not construct URLs from other information—they just use the URLs that are passed out by the server as-is. This is how the browser works—it does not construct the URLs it uses from piece parts, and it does not understand the website-specific formats of the URLs it uses; it just blindly follows the URLs that it finds in the current page received from the server, or that were bookmarked from previous pages or are entered by the user. The only parsing of a URL that a browser does is to extract the information required to send an HTTP request, and the only construction of URLs that a browser does is to form an absolute URL from relative and base URLs. If your API is a REST API, then your clients never have to understand the format of your URLs and those formats are not part of the API specification given to clients<sup>1</sup>.&nbsp;</p><p>REST APIs can be very simple. Lots of additional technologies have been invented for use with REST APIs—for example JSON API, ODATA, HAL, Siren or JSON Hyper-Schema and others—but you don't need any of those to do REST well.</p><h3>gRPC</h3><p>A second model for using HTTP for APIs is illustrated by gRPC. gRPC uses HTTP/2 under the covers, but HTTP is not exposed to the API designer. gRPC-generated stubs and skeletons hide HTTP from the client and server too, so nobody has to worry how the RPC concepts are mapped to HTTP—they just have to learn gRPC.&nbsp;</p><p>The way a client uses a gRPC API is by following these three steps:</p><ol><li><p>Decide which procedure to call</p></li><li><p>Calculate the parameter values to use (if any)</p></li><li><p>Use a code-generated stub to make the call, passing the parameter values</p></li></ol><h3>OpenAPI</h3><p>Probably the most popular way of designing RPC APIs that use HTTP is to use specification languages like OpenAPI (formerly known as the Swagger specification).</p><p>A signature characteristic of the OpenAPI style of API is that clients use the API by constructing URLs from other information. The way a client uses an OpenAPI API is by following these three steps:</p><ol><li><p>Decide which OpenAPI URL path template to use</p></li><li><p>Calculate the parameter values to use (if any)</p></li><li><p>Plug the parameter values into the URL path template and send an HTTP request.</p></li></ol><p>It should be immediately obvious that an API that works this way is not a REST API. The OpenAPI method of using HTTP requires clients to have detailed knowledge of the format of the URLs they use in requests and to construct URLs that conform to that format from other information. This is the opposite of the way a REST API works, where clients are completely blind to the formats of the URLs they use, and never have to construct them. The model supported by OpenAPI is very popular and successful and is one of the most important options available to API designers—the fact that the OpenAPI model is not REST does not diminish its usefulness or importance.</p></span></section><section><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p>The second observation you will probably make is that the client model for using an OpenAPI API is very similar to the client model for using a gRPC API. Where a gRPC client chooses a procedure to call, an OpenAPI client chooses a URL path template to use. gRPC and OpenAPI clients both calculate parameter values. Where a gRPC client uses a stub procedure to combine the parameters with the procedure signature and make the call, an OpenAPI client inserts the parameter values into the URL path template and issues an HTTP request. The detail is different but the overall model is very similar. OpenAPI also includes tools that will optionally generate a client stub procedure in the client programming language that hides these details, making the client experience of the two even more similar.<br></p><p>One way to explain the close similarity between the client models of gRPC and OpenAPI is to consider OpenAPI to be a language for specifying a classic RPC API with a custom mapping to HTTP requests. If you accept that idea, then gRPC and OpenAPI are both RPC interface definition languages (IDLs), with the essential difference between them being that OpenAPI exposes the details of the underlying HTTP transport to the client and allows the API designer to control the mapping, while gRPC hides all the HTTP details using a predefined mapping.</p><p>Even if you don't accept the idea that the fundamental API model used by OpenAPI is just good old-fashioned RPC, it is hard to deny that there are some obvious parallels between the two, and they are both distinct from REST. Either way, I think the parallels help motivate the more detailed comparison that follows.</p><p>Each of these approaches has some benefits and drawbacks—we'll explore all three and leave you with some thoughts on how to decide which one is best for your application.</p><h2>Look how easy and obvious RPC is!</h2><p>Here is an example from a popular&nbsp;<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/rest-is-the-new-soap-97ff6c09896d/" target="_blank">blog post</a>&nbsp;that extols the virtues of RPC (we'll come back to this blog post later):</p></span></section><section><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p>The blogger says that many people find it easy to define an RPC API for this problem, but struggle to figure out how to solve the same problem using HTTP, wasting a lot of time and energy without realizing any benefit to their project. I agree. One reason is that designing an API on top of HTTP is a skill that has to be learned, and there are many options.</p><h2>Using the REST model is also easy and obvious</h2><p>Since we have designed many APIs using REST, it seems just as obvious to us how to express this example in REST. Here is what I would do:</p></span></section><section><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p>The username, contact_email, password, account_URL, and other bits of data supplied by the client are just simple JSON name/value pairs in the request body. I left out the details of what is in the headers, and how the results are returned, because it's all explained in the HTTP specifications—there aren't really choices or decisions to make.</p><p>All the identifiers passed between the client and the server in both directions are URLs—there are no identifiers in the API that are not also URLs. Whenever one resource includes a reference to another, that reference is expressed using the other resource's URL. This technique is called hypertext, or hypermedia—if your API does not use URLs this way, it is not using the REST model, since hypertext linking is a signature feature that distinguishes REST from other models<sup>2</sup>. RPC APIs also express relationships between entities by including the identifiers of one entity in another entity, but those identifiers are not URLs that can be used directly without requiring additional information.</p><h2>Advantages of REST</h2><p>The claimed advantages of REST are basically those of the world wide web itself, like stability, uniformity, and universality. They are documented elsewhere, and REST is anyway a minority interest, so we won't dwell on them too much here. An exception is the entity-orientation inherent in the HTTP/REST model. This feature is of special interest because it has been widely discussed and adopted by proponents of non-REST models like gRPC and OpenAPI.&nbsp;</p><p>In my experience, entity-oriented models are simpler, more regular, easier to understand, and more stable over time than simple RPC models. RPC APIs tend to grow organically as one procedure after another is added, each one implementing an action that the system can perform.</p><p>An entity-oriented model provides an overall organization for the system's behaviors. For example, we are all familiar with the entity model of online shopping, with its products, carts, orders, accounts, and so on. If that capability were expressed using only RPC procedures, it would result in a long, unstructured list of procedures for browsing catalogs of products, adding them to carts, checking out, tracking deliveries, and returning products.&nbsp;</p><p>The list quickly becomes overwhelming, and it's difficult to achieve coherence between the procedure definitions. One way to bring structure and order to the list is to model all the behaviors using a standard set of procedures for each entity type. HTTP is inherently entity-oriented, but you can also add entity-orientation to RPC, as discussed later. Grouping procedures by entity type is also one of the key ideas of object-oriented languages.</p><h2>How you use OpenAPI</h2><p>In OpenAPI, you define things called paths. An OpenAPI path looks like this in YAML:</p></span></section><section><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p>APIs that define paths like these expose the values of {petId} to the client in various places in the API, and require the client to use an appropriate path definition in order to convert the {petId} value (and other values) into a URL that can be used in HTTP requests.</p><p>Expressing and using IDs this way is an alternative to the hypertext link that is a signature idea of REST.</p><p>OpenAPI calls the variables in these paths "parameters" and the combination of a path and an HTTP method is called an operation—similar terminology to RPC systems.&nbsp;</p><p><i><b>OpenAPI's use of URL templates with parameters can be viewed as a way to express RPC-like concepts with custom mappings to HTTP.</b></i></p><h2>OpenAPI advantages and disadvantages</h2><p>In my opinion, OpenAPI has two fundamental characteristics that account for its success. The first is that the OpenAPI model is similar to the traditional RPC model with which most programmers are familiar and comfortable. The model also fits well with the concepts of the programming languages they use. The second reason is that it allows programmers to define a custom mapping of those RPC concepts to HTTP requests. This second characteristic brings with it both benefits and problems. The primary benefit is that clients can access the API using only standard HTTP technologies. This is especially important for public APIs because it means that the API is accessible from almost all programming languages and environments without requiring the client to adopt any additional technology. A disadvantage is that it can require significant effort to design the HTTP details—witness all the guidance on the web on what you should and shouldn't do, much of it contradictory—and further effort by the consumer to learn it.</p><h2>When might gRPC be a better option than OpenAPI?</h2><p>Your design challenge for APIs described with OpenAPI is to define a combination of URL paths and HTTP methods to represent your "operations" and their "parameters." This can be tricky work, because there are lots of options. It is not clear that it is a good use of time and energy for most projects. Frustrations resulting from this approach are described with passion in the blog post comparing SOAP to REST by Pascal Chambon that we mentioned before, which also supplied the RPC example we opened with.&nbsp;</p><p>Chambon's post contains some misinformation and misunderstanding, and most of the <a href="https://philsturgeon.uk/api/2017/12/18/rest-confusion-explained/" target="_blank">reaction to his post</a> focused on correcting that, but Chambon's mistakes actually add support to his main point, which is that designing your own mapping of RPC-like concepts onto HTTP is fairly complicated and difficult.</p><p>Most of the advice that was offered in response to Chambon's blog post promoted REST as an alternative to the RPC-like model that Chambon and most other people are familiar with. This is certainly an option—the simple REST example that we described at the beginning of this post is a minimalist's take on how exactly to do that.</p><p>Another option for Chambon is to keep his basic RPC model, but use gRPC instead of OpenAPI to express it. This avoids the complexity of defining a custom mapping of the API to HTTP. The RPC model has shown much more enduring popularity than any alternative, and if API designers are going to use an RPC-like model anyway, then they should weigh all the available technologies for doing that.</p><h2>gRPC benefits</h2><p>gRPC expresses an RPC API in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_description_language" target="_blank">interface description language</a> (IDL) that benefits from a long tradition of RPC IDLs that includes DCE IDL, Corba IDL, and many others. gRPC's IDL provides a simpler and more direct way of defining remote procedures than OpenAPI's approach of using URL paths, their parameters, and the HTTP methods that are used with them.</p><p>gRPC uses HTTP/2 under the covers, but gRPC does not expose any of HTTP/2 to the API designer or API user. gRPC has already made all the decisions on how to layer the RPC model on top of HTTP so you don't have to—those decisions are built into the gRPC software and generated code. This makes life simpler for API designers and clients. By contrast, OpenAPI requires API designers to specify the details of how the RPC model is expressed on top of HTTP for their specific API, and the client of the API has to learn that detail. An important advantage of the OpenAPI approach is that it lets API clients use standard HTTP tools and technologies, which for many API designers justifies the effort.</p><p>Regardless of how your API uses HTTP, it is likely that you will want to create client-side programming libraries in various languages for programmers to use. These programming libraries will take the form of procedures (possibly called functions or methods, depending on the programming language). One of gRPC's most attractive characteristics is that it is very good at generating client-side programming libraries that are intuitive for programmers to use and execute efficiently. OpenAPI can also generate client-side programming libraries, but I find the gRPC version simpler and more obvious, probably because its IDL only has to express RPC concepts and does not have to simultaneously describe a mapping of those concepts to HTTP.</p><p>APIs specified in gRPC are also simple to implement on the server side. Because of the frameworks, libraries, and code-generation that gRPC provides, it may be simpler to create the server implementation of a gRPC method than to write a standard HTTP request handler that parses incoming requests and calls the right implementation functions, despite the many frameworks that aim to help with that.</p><p>Another characteristic of gRPC is good performance. gRPC uses a binary payload that is efficient to create and to parse, and it exploits HTTP/2 for efficient management of connections. Of course, you can also use binary payloads and HTTP/2 directly without using gRPC, but this requires you and your clients to master more technology.</p><p>gRPC also avoids the problem that even the best HTTP-based APIs don't implement the whole HTTP protocol, which requires API providers and clients to figure out how to specify and learn which subset of HTTP is supported by a particular API. This is a problem for both REST and OpenAPI APIs. gRPC avoids this problem by requiring the client and the server to both adopt special software that implements the complete gRPC protocol. We hope gRPC succeeds in keeping that protocol stable for at least 25 years as HTTP has done, so that clients don't break when servers are upgraded and vice versa.</p><h2>How do you combine the entity-oriented model with RPC?</h2><p>Regardless of whether you are using gRPC or OpenAPI, the trick to using RPC in an entity-oriented way is to constrain the RPC method definitions to only those that map easily to the standard entity operations (Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete, often called CRUD<sup>3</sup>, plus List) for each resource type.&nbsp;</p><p>To use RPC in an entity-oriented style, you reverse the usual RPC thought process—instead of starting with procedure definitions, you start by defining your resource types, and then make RPC method definitions corresponding to the common entity operations on those types plus any additional operations you find necessary.</p><p>Using RPC in an entity-oriented style depends on teaching people a constrained usage pattern. In practice we see that APIs that are designed this way are sometimes a blend of entity-oriented and procedure-oriented concepts, which undermines some of the benefits.</p><h2>So what are the downsides of gRPC?</h2><p>Every technology has downsides and limitations. We’ve already discussed some of OpenAPI's.</p><p>A popular feature of HTTP APIs is that clients can use them and servers can implement them using only general-purpose and widely available technologies. API calls can easily be made by simply typing URLs into a browser, or issuing cURL commands in a terminal window or in a bash script. Programmers can access or implement an HTTP API using no more technology than a basic HTTP library. In contrast, gRPC requires special software on both the client and the server. gRPC-generated code has to be incorporated into client and server build processes—this may be onerous to some, especially those who are used to working in dynamic languages like Javascript or Python where the build process, at least on development machines, may be non-existent. The Google <a href="https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/grpc/transcoding">Cloud Endpoints</a> product enables gRPC APIs to be accessed via HTTP and JSON without special software, which restores many options for clients, but not everyone wants to or is able to use Cloud Endpoints or find or build an equivalent.</p><p>It’s simple to write a bot that crawls the entirety of a REST API without metadata<sup>4</sup>, similarly to the way a browser or a web bot can crawl the entire HTML web. You can’t do this with an RPC-style API, regardless of whether it’s described using gRPC or OpenAPI, because RPC gives each entity type a different API that requires custom software or metadata to use it. In practice it usually isn't critical to be able to write general-purpose API clients, although it can be useful.</p><p>HTTP APIs are often proxied to add security features, perform input validation, map data formats, and solve many other problems. This typically requires adding, removing or modifying headers, and parsing and even modifying the body. Proxies use a combination of standard and custom headers to achieve this. These features are commonly implemented using products like Apigee Edge that do not require traditional programming skills or the kind of software development environments that can easily integrate gRPC. I think it would be much harder to do this sort of proxying for gRPC, and I am not aware of it being commonly done.</p></span></section><section><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p>Using an entity-oriented approach with gRPC is mostly useful for new-builds—you won't find it easy to retrofit to an existing RPC API.<br></p><p>gRPC does not define a standard mechanism to prevent loss of data when two clients try to update the same resource at the same time, so if you use gRPC, you will likely have to invent your own. HTTP defines standard Etag and If-Match headers for this purpose—most of the HTTP APIs we design use these headers.<br></p><p>Nor does gRPC define a mechanism for making partial updates, so you will likely have to invent your own. HTTP defines a method—PATCH—for partial updates but does not say what a patch should look like or how to apply it. There are two additional IETF standards that fill this gap for JSON: <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386" target="_blank">JSON merge patch</a> and <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902" target="_blank">JSON patch</a>. The first is simpler to use but does not handle all cases, particularly updates of arrays; the second handles more cases but is more complex to use. Most of the recent HTTP APIs I have built implement both standards and let the client choose; the Kubernetes API works this way too.<br></p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>There are a few APIs that use the same REST hypertext model used by the HTML web. They aim to inherit the core qualities of the HTML web, like stability, uniformity, and universality. If you already know how to design APIs this way, or are motivated to learn, then this is a fine approach. This is my own preference.</p><p>APIs that are described with OpenAPI are based on concepts analogous to those of RPC, but with a custom mapping to HTTP. This approach allows clients to access the resulting API using only commonly-available HTTP technologies, but it also adds additional design choices to these APIs, which can make them more difficult to design and build and more difficult to learn.</p><p>If you are considering using OpenAPI for an API, you should also consider the option of designing and implementing it using gRPC. The fundamental API models of the two are comparable and gRPC avoids the need to invent your own mapping onto HTTP.&nbsp;</p><p>Regardless of whether you use gRPC or OpenAPI for your API, you can obtain some, but not all, of the benefits of a REST API if you organize the API in an entity-oriented style, standardize the names of your procedures (for example by sticking to the verbs create, retrieve, update, delete and list), and impose other naming conventions. gRPC will bring some other benefits of its own. Using gRPC is especially attractive if one of the following is true:</p><ul><li><p>You can use a product like Cloud Endpoints so that your clients are not forced to adopt gRPC technologies just because you did.</p></li><li><p>The API is internal, where you control the technology choices of all the clients as well as the server.</p></li></ul><p>If you adopt gRPC in place of OpenAPI or REST, you should at least be aware of the much more limited opportunity to augment or remediate the API's behaviors in proxies, especially those implemented using API management tools like Apigee Edge or its competitors. Depending on how and where you intend to use gRPC, this may or may not be a problem.</p><p>As with most design challenges, there are many factors to consider and tradeoffs to be made. Hopefully this discussion has helped explain some of the ways in which HTTP and RPC-style APIs match up against one another.</p><p><i>Special thanks to Nandan Sridhar and Marsh Gardiner for their contributions to this post.</i></p><hr><p><sub>1. Some REST APIs allow clients to append a query to a base URL, in which case clients need to understand the query syntax supported by the server in the query portion of the URL, although they don't need to know the format of the rest of the URL. Some REST API designers allow queries to be encoded in URL paths, in which case their query URLs start to look like the OpenAPI-style URLs discussed below.<br>2.&nbsp;Some REST commentators say that in order to claim compliance with the REST model you have to also implement something akin to HTML forms in JSON, but almost all would agree that if hypertext links are not a prominent feature of the API then it is not REST.<br>3.&nbsp;Even in strictly entity-oriented APIs we sometimes come across the need for a fifth operation that we think of as "translate" or "convert". Translate takes in one entity and produces another without creating a persistent resource. HTTP doesn't have a special method for this operation, so we have to use POST for both "create" and "translate". Sometimes we also use POST for retrieve to get around limitations on URL length, usually for URLs that include queries.<br>4.&nbsp;With a small amount of extra work on the server you can let the browser itself crawl a REST API.</sub></p></span></section><section><span>Posted in</span><ul><li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/api-management" track-metadata-position="body" track-metadata-eventdetail="cloud.google.com/blog/products/api-management" track-metadata-module="tag list" track-metadata-module_headline="posted in">API Management</a></li><li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/application-development" track-metadata-position="body" track-metadata-eventdetail="cloud.google.com/blog/products/application-development" track-metadata-module="tag list" track-metadata-module_headline="posted in">Application Development</a></li><li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/apigee" track-metadata-position="body" track-metadata-eventdetail="cloud.google.com/blog/products/apigee" track-metadata-module="tag list" track-metadata-module_headline="posted in">Apigee</a></li></ul></section></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Start using Tailwind CSS v4.0 today by <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation">installing it in a new project</a>, or playing with it directly in the browser on <a href="https://play.tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind Play</a>.</p>
<p>For existing projects, we've published a comprehensive <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/upgrade-guide">upgrade guide</a> and built an <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/upgrade-guide#using-the-upgrade-tool">automated upgrade tool</a> to get you on the latest version as quickly and painlessly as possible.</p>

<h2 id="new-high-performance-engine"><a href="#new-high-performance-engine">New high-performance engine</a></h2>
<p>Tailwind CSS v4.0 is a ground-up rewrite of the framework, taking everything we've learned about the architecture over the years and optimizing it to be as fast as possible.</p>
<p>When benchmarking it on our own projects, we've found full rebuilds to be over 3.5x faster, and incremental builds to be over 8x faster.</p>
<p>Here are the median build times we saw when we benchmarked Tailwind CSS v4.0 against <a href="https://tailwindui.com/templates/catalyst">Catalyst</a>:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th></th><th>v3.4</th><th>v4.0</th><th>Improvement</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Full build</td><td>378ms</td><td>100ms</td><td>3.78x</td></tr><tr><td>Incremental rebuild with new CSS</td><td>44ms</td><td>5ms</td><td>8.8x</td></tr><tr><td>Incremental rebuild with no new CSS</td><td>35ms</td><td>192µs</td><td>182x</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>The most impressive improvement is on incremental builds that don't actually need to compile any new CSS — these builds are over 100x faster and complete in <em>microseconds</em>. And the longer you work on a project, the more of these builds you run into because you're just using classes you've already used before, like <code>flex</code>, <code>col-span-2</code>, or <code>font-bold</code>.</p>

<h2 id="designed-for-the-modern-web"><a href="#designed-for-the-modern-web">Designed for the modern web</a></h2>
<p>The platform has evolved a lot since we released Tailwind CSS v3.0, and v4.0 takes full advantage of many of these improvements.</p>
<div><p>CSS</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>@layer</span><span> theme</span><span>,</span><span> base</span><span>,</span><span> components</span><span>,</span><span> utilities</span><span>;</span></span><span></span><span><span>@layer</span><span> utilities </span><span>{</span></span><span><span>  .mx-6</span><span> {</span></span><span><span>    margin-inline</span><span>: </span><span>calc</span><span>(</span><span>var</span><span>(</span><span>--spacing</span><span>)</span><span> *</span><span> 6</span><span>);</span></span><span><span>  }</span></span><span><span>  .bg-blue-500</span><span>\/</span><span>50</span><span> {</span></span><span><span>    background-color</span><span>: </span><span>color-mix</span><span>(</span><span>in oklab</span><span>,</span><span> var</span><span>(</span><span>--color-blue-500</span><span>)</span><span> 50</span><span>%</span><span>,</span><span> transparent</span><span>);</span></span><span><span>  }</span></span><span><span>}</span></span><span></span><span><span>@property</span><span> --tw-gradient-from </span><span>{</span></span><span><span>  syntax: "&lt;color</span><span>&gt;</span><span>";</span></span><span><span>  inherits: false;</span></span><span><span>  initial-value</span><span>: </span><span>#</span><span>0000;</span></span><span><span>}</span></span><span></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>We're leveraging modern CSS features like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Native cascade layers</strong> — giving us more control than ever over how different style rules interact with each other.</li>
<li><strong>Registered custom properties</strong> — making it possible to do things like animate gradients, and significantly improving performance on large pages.</li>
<li><strong>color-mix()</strong> — which lets us adjust the opacity of any color value, including CSS variables and <code>currentColor</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Logical properties</strong> — simplifying RTL support and reducing the size of your generated CSS.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of these features have even simplified Tailwind internally, reducing the surface area for bugs and making the framework easier for us to maintain.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="simplified-installation"><a href="#simplified-installation">Simplified installation</a></h2>
<p>We've streamlined the setup process a ton in v4.0, reducing the number of steps and removing a lot of boilerplate.</p>
<div data-stack="true"><div><p>1. Install Tailwind CSS</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>npm</span><span> i</span><span> tailwindcss</span><span> @tailwindcss/postcss</span><span>;</span></span><span></span></code></pre></div></div><div><p>2. Add the PostCSS plugin</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>export</span><span> default</span><span> {</span></span><span><span>  plugins</span><span>:</span><span> [</span><span>"@tailwindcss/postcss"</span><span>]</span><span>,</span></span><span><span>};</span></span><span></span></code></pre></div></div><div><p>3. Import Tailwind in your CSS</p></div></div>
<p>With the improvements we've made to this process for v4.0, Tailwind feels more light-weight than ever:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Just one-line of CSS</strong> — no more <code>@tailwind</code> directives, just add <code>@import "tailwindcss"</code> and start building.</li>
<li><strong>Zero configuration</strong> — you can start using the framework without configuring anything, not even the paths to your template files.</li>
<li><strong>No external plugins required</strong> — we bundle <code>@import</code> rules for you out of the box, and use <a href="https://lightningcss.dev/">Lightning CSS</a> under the hood for vendor prefixing and modern syntax transforms.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sure you only go through this once per project, but it adds up when you're starting and abandoning a different side-project every weekend.</p>
<h2 id="first-party-vite-plugin"><a href="#first-party-vite-plugin">First-party Vite plugin</a></h2>
<p>If you're a Vite user, you can now integrate Tailwind using <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite"><code>@tailwindcss/vite</code></a> instead of PostCSS:</p>
<div><p>vite.config.ts</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>import</span><span> {</span><span> defineConfig</span><span> }</span><span> from</span><span> "vite"</span><span>;</span></span><span><span>import</span><span> tailwindcss</span><span> from</span><span> "@tailwindcss/vite"</span><span>;</span></span><span></span><span><span>export</span><span> default</span><span> defineConfig</span><span>(</span><span>{</span></span><span><span>  plugins</span><span>:</span><span> [</span></span><span><span>    tailwindcss</span><span>()</span><span>,</span></span><span><span>  ]</span><span>,</span></span><span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span><span></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>Tailwind CSS v4.0 is incredibly fast when used as a PostCSS plugin, but you'll get even better performance using the Vite plugin.</p>
<h2 id="automatic-content-detection"><a href="#automatic-content-detection">Automatic content detection</a></h2>
<p>You know how you always had to configure that annoying <code>content</code> array in Tailwind CSS v3? In v4.0, we came up with a bunch of heuristics for detecting all of that stuff automatically so you don’t have to configure it at all.</p>
<p>For example, we automatically ignore anything in your <code>.gitignore</code> file to avoid scanning dependencies or generated files that aren’t under version control:</p>
<div><p>.gitignore</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>/node_modules</span></span><span><span>/coverage</span></span><span><span>/.next/</span></span><span><span>/build</span></span><span></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>We also automatically ignore all binary extensions like images, videos, .zip files, and more.</p>
<p>And if you ever need to explicitly add a source that's excluded by default, you can always add it with the <code>@source</code> directive, right in your CSS file:</p>
<div><p>CSS</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>@import</span><span> "tailwindcss"</span><span>;</span></span><span><span>@source</span><span> "../node_modules/@my-company/ui-lib"</span><span>;</span></span><span></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>The <code>@source</code> directive uses the same heuristics under the hood, so it will exclude binary file types for example as well, without you having to specify all of the extensions to scan explicitly.</p>

<hr>
<h2 id="built-in-import-support"><a href="#built-in-import-support">Built-in import support</a></h2>
<p>Before v4.0, if you wanted to inline other CSS files using <code>@import</code> you'd have to configure another plugin like <code>postcss-import</code> to handle it for you.</p>
<p>Now we handle this out of the box, so you don't need any other tools:</p>
<div><p>postcss.config.js</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>export</span><span> default</span><span> {</span></span><span><span>  plugins</span><span>:</span><span> [</span></span><span><span>    "postcss-import"</span><span>,</span></span><span><span>    "@tailwindcss/postcss"</span><span>,</span></span><span><span>  ]</span><span>,</span></span><span><span>};</span></span><span></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>Our import system is purpose-built for Tailwind CSS, so we've also been able to make it even faster by tightly integrating it with our engine.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="css-first-configuration"><a href="#css-first-configuration">CSS-first configuration</a></h2>
<p>One of the biggest changes in Tailwind CSS v4.0 is the shift from configuring your project in JavaScript to configuring it in CSS.</p>
<p>Instead of a <code>tailwind.config.js</code> file, you can configure all of your customizations directly in the CSS file where you import Tailwind, giving you one less file to worry about in your project:</p>
<div><p>CSS</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>@import</span><span> "tailwindcss"</span><span>;</span></span><span></span><span><span>@theme</span><span> {</span></span><span><span>  --font-display</span><span>: </span><span>"Satoshi"</span><span>,</span><span> "sans-serif"</span><span>;</span></span><span></span><span><span>  --breakpoint-3xl</span><span>: </span><span>1920</span><span>px</span><span>;</span></span><span></span><span><span>  --color-avocado-100</span><span>: </span><span>oklch</span><span>(</span><span>0.99 0 0</span><span>);</span></span><span><span>  --color-avocado-200</span><span>: </span><span>oklch</span><span>(</span><span>0.98 0.04 113.22</span><span>);</span></span><span><span>  --color-avocado-300</span><span>: </span><span>oklch</span><span>(</span><span>0.94 0.11 115.03</span><span>);</span></span><span><span>  --color-avocado-400</span><span>: </span><span>oklch</span><span>(</span><span>0.92 0.19 114.08</span><span>);</span></span><span><span>  --color-avocado-500</span><span>: </span><span>oklch</span><span>(</span><span>0.84 0.18 117.33</span><span>);</span></span><span><span>  --color-avocado-600</span><span>: </span><span>oklch</span><span>(</span><span>0.53 0.12 118.34</span><span>);</span></span><span></span><span><span>  --ease-fluid</span><span>: </span><span>cubic-bezier</span><span>(</span><span>0.3</span><span>,</span><span> 0</span><span>,</span><span> 0</span><span>,</span><span> 1</span><span>);</span></span><span><span>  --ease-snappy</span><span>: </span><span>cubic-bezier</span><span>(</span><span>0.2</span><span>,</span><span> 0</span><span>,</span><span> 0</span><span>,</span><span> 1</span><span>);</span></span><span></span><span><span>  /* ... */</span></span><span><span>}</span></span><span></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>The new CSS-first configuration lets you do just about everything you could do in your <code>tailwind.config.js</code> file, including configuring your design tokens, defining custom utilities and variants, and more.</p>
<p>To learn more about how it all works, read the new <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/theme">theme variables</a> documentation.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="css-theme-variables"><a href="#css-theme-variables">CSS theme variables</a></h2>
<p>Tailwind CSS v4.0 takes all of your design tokens and makes them available as CSS variables by default, so you can reference any value you need at run-time using just CSS.</p>
<p>Using the example <code>@theme</code> from earlier, all of these values will be added to your CSS to as regular custom properties:</p>
<div><p>Generated CSS</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>:root</span><span> {</span></span><span><span>  --font-display</span><span>: </span><span>"Satoshi"</span><span>,</span><span> "sans-serif"</span><span>;</span></span><span></span><span><span>  --breakpoint-3xl</span><span>: </span><span>1920</span><span>px</span><span>;</span></span><span></span><span><span>  --color-avocado-100</span><span>: </span><span>oklch</span><span>(</span><span>0.99 0 0</span><span>);</span></span><span><span>  --color-avocado-200</span><span>: </span><span>oklch</span><span>(</span><span>0.98 0.04 113.22</span><span>);</span></span><span><span>  --color-avocado-300</span><span>: </span><span>oklch</span><span>(</span><span>0.94 0.11 115.03</span><span>);</span></span><span><span>  --color-avocado-400</span><span>: </span><span>oklch</span><span>(</span><span>0.92 0.19 114.08</span><span>);</span></span><span><span>  --color-avocado-500</span><span>: </span><span>oklch</span><span>(</span><span>0.84 0.18 117.33</span><span>);</span></span><span><span>  --color-avocado-600</span><span>: </span><span>oklch</span><span>(</span><span>0.53 0.12 118.34</span><span>);</span></span><span></span><span><span>  --ease-fluid</span><span>: </span><span>cubic-bezier</span><span>(</span><span>0.3</span><span>,</span><span> 0</span><span>,</span><span> 0</span><span>,</span><span> 1</span><span>);</span></span><span><span>  --ease-snappy</span><span>: </span><span>cubic-bezier</span><span>(</span><span>0.2</span><span>,</span><span> 0</span><span>,</span><span> 0</span><span>,</span><span> 1</span><span>);</span></span><span></span><span><span>  /* ... */</span></span><span><span>}</span></span><span></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>This makes it easy to reuse these values as inline styles or pass them to libraries like <a href="https://motion.dev/docs/react-animation#css-variables">Motion</a> to animate them.</p>

<h2 id="dynamic-utility-values-and-variants"><a href="#dynamic-utility-values-and-variants">Dynamic utility values and variants</a></h2>
<p>We've simplified the way many utilities and variants work in v4.0 by effectively allowing them to accept certain types of arbitrary values, <em>without</em> the need for any configuration or dropping down to the arbitrary value syntax.</p>
<p>For example, in Tailwind CSS v4.0 you can create grids of any size out of the box:</p>
<div><p>HTML</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>&lt;</span><span>div</span><span> class</span><span>=</span><span>"grid </span><span>grid-cols-15</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span>  &lt;!-- ... --&gt;</span></span><span><span>&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>You can also target custom boolean data attributes without needing to define them:</p>
<div><p>HTML</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>&lt;</span><span>div</span><span> data-current</span><span> class</span><span>=</span><span>"opacity-75 </span><span>data-current:opacity-100</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span>  &lt;!-- ... --&gt;</span></span><span><span>&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>Even spacing utilities like <code>px-*</code>, <code>mt-*</code>, <code>w-*</code>, <code>h-*</code>, and more are now dynamically derived from a single spacing scale variable and accept any value out of the box:</p>
<div><p>Generated CSS</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>@layer</span><span> theme </span><span>{</span></span><span><span>  :root</span><span> {</span></span><span><span>    --spacing</span><span>: </span><span>0.25</span><span>rem</span><span>;</span></span><span><span>  }</span></span><span><span>}</span></span><span></span><span><span>@layer</span><span> utilities </span><span>{</span></span><span><span>  .mt-8</span><span> {</span></span><span><span>    margin-top</span><span>: </span><span>calc</span><span>(</span><span>var</span><span>(</span><span>--spacing</span><span>)</span><span> *</span><span> 8</span><span>);</span></span><span><span>  }</span></span><span><span>  .w-17</span><span> {</span></span><span><span>    width</span><span>: </span><span>calc</span><span>(</span><span>var</span><span>(</span><span>--spacing</span><span>)</span><span> *</span><span> 17</span><span>);</span></span><span><span>  }</span></span><span><span>  .pr-29</span><span> {</span></span><span><span>    padding-right</span><span>: </span><span>calc</span><span>(</span><span>var</span><span>(</span><span>--spacing</span><span>)</span><span> *</span><span> 29</span><span>);</span></span><span><span>  }</span></span><span><span>}</span></span><span></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>The upgrade tool we released alongside v4.0 will even simplify most of these utilities for you automatically if it notices you using an arbitrary value that's no longer needed.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="modernized-p3-color-palette"><a href="#modernized-p3-color-palette">Modernized P3 color palette</a></h2>
<p>We've upgraded the entire default color palette from <code>rgb</code> to <code>oklch</code>, taking advantage of the wider gamut to make the colors more vivid in places where we were previously limited by the sRGB color space.</p>

<p>We've tried to keep the balance between all the colors the same as it was in v3, so even though we've refreshed things across the board, it shouldn't feel like a breaking change when upgrading your existing projects.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="container-queries"><a href="#container-queries">Container queries</a></h2>
<p>We've brought container query support into core for v4.0, so you don't need the <code>@tailwindcss/container-queries</code> plugin anymore:</p>
<div><p>HTML</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>&lt;</span><span>div</span><span> class</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>@container</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span>  &lt;</span><span>div</span><span> class</span><span>=</span><span>"grid grid-cols-1 </span><span>@sm:grid-cols-3</span><span> </span><span>@lg:grid-cols-4</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span>    &lt;!-- ... --&gt;</span></span><span><span>  &lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span>&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>We've also added support for max-width container queries using the new <code>@max-*</code> variant:</p>
<div><p>HTML</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>&lt;</span><span>div</span><span> class</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>@container</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span>  &lt;</span><span>div</span><span> class</span><span>=</span><span>"grid grid-cols-3 </span><span>@max-md:grid-cols-1</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span>    &lt;!-- ... --&gt;</span></span><span><span>  &lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span>&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>Like our regular breakpoint variants, you can also stack <code>@min-*</code> and <code>@max-*</code> variants to define container query ranges:</p>
<div><p>HTML</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>&lt;</span><span>div</span><span> class</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>@container</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span>  &lt;</span><span>div</span><span> class</span><span>=</span><span>"flex </span><span>@min-md:@max-xl:hidden</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span>    &lt;!-- ... --&gt;</span></span><span><span>  &lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span>&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span></span></code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="new-3d-transform-utilities"><a href="#new-3d-transform-utilities">New 3D transform utilities</a></h2>
<p>We've finally added APIs for doing 3D transforms, like <code>rotate-x-*</code>, <code>rotate-y-*</code>, <code>scale-z-*</code>, <code>translate-z-*</code>, and tons more.</p>

<h2 id="expanded-gradient-apis"><a href="#expanded-gradient-apis">Expanded gradient APIs</a></h2>
<p>We've added a ton of new gradient features in v4.0, so you can pull off even fancier effects without having to write any custom CSS.</p>
<h3 id="linear-gradient-angles"><a href="#linear-gradient-angles">Linear gradient angles</a></h3>
<p>Linear gradients now support angles as values, so you can use utilities like <code>bg-linear-45</code> to create a gradient on a 45 degree angle:</p>
<div><figure><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>&lt;</span><span>div</span><span> class</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>bg-linear-45</span><span> from-indigo-500 via-purple-500 to-pink-500"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span></span></code></pre></div></figure></div>
<p>You may notice we've renamed <code>bg-gradient-*</code> to <code>bg-linear-*</code> too — you'll see why shortly!</p>
<h3 id="gradient-interpolation-modifiers"><a href="#gradient-interpolation-modifiers">Gradient interpolation modifiers</a></h3>
<p>We've added the ability to control the color interpolation mode for gradients using a modifier, so a class like <code>bg-linear-to-r/srgb</code> interpolates using sRGB, and <code>bg-linear-to-r/oklch</code> interpolates using OKLCH:</p>
<div><figure><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>&lt;</span><span>div</span><span> class</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>bg-linear-to-r/srgb</span><span> from-indigo-500 to-teal-400"</span><span>&gt;</span><span>...</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>div</span><span> class</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>bg-linear-to-r/oklch</span><span> from-indigo-500 to-teal-400"</span><span>&gt;</span><span>...</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span></span></code></pre></div></figure></div>
<p>Using polar color spaces like OKLCH or HSL can lead to much more vivid gradients when the <code>from-*</code> and <code>to-*</code> colors are far apart on the color wheel. We're using OKLAB by default in v4.0 but you can always interpolate using a different color space by adding one of these modifiers.</p>
<h3 id="conic-and-radial-gradients"><a href="#conic-and-radial-gradients">Conic and radial gradients</a></h3>
<p>We've added new <code>bg-conic-*</code> and <code>bg-radial-*</code> utilities for creating conic and radial gradients:</p>
<div><figure><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>&lt;</span><span>div</span><span> class</span><span>=</span><span>"size-24 rounded-full </span><span>bg-conic/[in_hsl_longer_hue]</span><span> from-red-600 to-red-600"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>div</span><span> class</span><span>=</span><span>"size-24 rounded-full </span><span>bg-radial-[at_25%_25%]</span><span> from-white to-zinc-900 to-75%"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span></span></code></pre></div></figure></div>
<p>These new utilities work alongside the existing <code>from-*</code>, <code>via-*</code>, and <code>to-*</code> utilities to let you create conic and radial gradients the same way you create linear gradients, and include modifiers for setting the color interpolation method and arbitrary value support for controlling details like the gradient position.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="starting-style-support"><a href="#starting-style-support">@starting-style support</a></h2>
<p>The new <code>starting</code> variant adds support for the new CSS <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@starting-style"><code>@starting-style</code></a> feature, making it possible to transition element properties when an element is first displayed:</p>
<div><figure><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>&lt;</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span>  &lt;</span><span>button</span><span> popovertarget</span><span>=</span><span>"my-popover"</span><span>&gt;</span><span>Check for updates</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span>  &lt;</span><span>div</span><span> popover</span><span> id</span><span>=</span><span>"my-popover"</span><span> class</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>transition-discrete</span><span> </span><span>starting:open:opacity-0</span><span> ..."</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span>    &lt;!-- ... --&gt;</span></span><span><span>  &lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span>&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span></span></code></pre></div></figure></div>
<p>With <code>@starting-style</code>, you can finally animate elements as they appear on the page without the need for any JavaScript at all. <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_at-rules_starting-style">Browser support</a> probably isn't quite there yet for most teams, but we're getting close!</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="not-variant"><a href="#not-variant">not-* variant</a></h2>
<p>We've added a new <code>not-*</code> variant which finally adds support for the CSS <code>:not()</code> pseudo-class:</p>
<div data-stack="true"><div><p>HTML</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>&lt;</span><span>div</span><span> class</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>not-hover:opacity-75</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span>  &lt;!-- ... --&gt;</span></span><span><span>&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span></span></code></pre></div></div><div><p>CSS</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>.not-hover</span><span>\:</span><span>opacity-75:not</span><span>(</span><span>*:hover</span><span>)</span><span> {</span></span><span><span>  opacity</span><span>: </span><span>75</span><span>%</span><span>;</span></span><span><span>}</span></span><span><span>@media</span><span> not</span><span> (</span><span>hover</span><span>:</span><span> hover</span><span>)</span><span> {</span></span><span><span>  .not-hover</span><span>\:</span><span>opacity-75</span><span> {</span></span><span><span>    opacity</span><span>: </span><span>75</span><span>%</span><span>;</span></span><span><span>  }</span></span><span><span>}</span></span><span></span></code></pre></div></div></div>
<p>It does double duty and also lets you negate media queries and <code>@supports</code> queries:</p>
<div data-stack="true"><div><p>HTML</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>&lt;</span><span>div</span><span> class</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>not-supports-hanging-punctation:px-4</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span>  &lt;!-- ... --&gt;</span></span><span><span>&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span></span></code></pre></div></div><div><p>CSS</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>.not-supports-hanging-punctation</span><span>\:</span><span>px-4</span><span> {</span></span><span><span>  @</span><span>supports</span><span> not</span><span> (</span><span>hanging-punctation</span><span>: </span><span>var</span><span>(</span><span>--tw</span><span>)) {</span></span><span><span>    padding-inline</span><span>: </span><span>calc</span><span>(</span><span>var</span><span>(</span><span>--spacing</span><span>)</span><span> *</span><span> 4</span><span>);</span></span><span><span>  }</span></span><span><span>}</span></span><span></span></code></pre></div></div></div>

<h2 id="even-more-new-utilities-and-variants"><a href="#even-more-new-utilities-and-variants">Even more new utilities and variants</a></h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>New <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/box-shadow#adding-an-inset-shadow"><code>inset-shadow-*</code></a> and <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/box-shadow#adding-an-inset-ring"><code>inset-ring-*</code></a> utilities</strong> — making it possible to stack up to four layers of box shadows on a single element.</li>

<p><br>Before we begin, let me be clear: yes, this <em>is</em> a subjective list. It’s not meant to end the debate — but to start it. These seven papers (sorted by date) stand out to me mostly because of their impact in today’s world. Honestly, each one deserves a blog post (or even a book!) of its own — but let’s keep it short for now. If your favorite doesn’t show up here, don’t worry, stick around for the bonus section at the end, where I’ll call out a few more that came <em>this</em> close to making the main list. So let’s dive in!</p>



<h3><br><strong>1. “On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem” (1936)</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Author:</strong> Alan Turing</p>



<p>It’s the 1930s, and a “programmable machine” sounds like something out of a sci-fi novel. Then along comes Alan Turing, laying the groundwork for what computers can theoretically do. He sketches out a hypothetical “Turing Machine,” proving that, if something is computable at all, a machine (in principle) can handle it.</p>



<h4><strong>The big idea</strong></h4>



<p>Turing’s simple model — just a tape, a head for reading/writing, and a finite set of states, turned into the granddaddy of all modern computation. It defined what’s solvable (and what’s not) in a purely mechanical sense, basically giving us the “rules of the game” for digital problem-solving.</p>



<h4><strong>Why it matters today</strong></h4>



<p>Every single programming language, every single piece of code out there, is playing by Turing’s rules. Even when we talk about quantum computing, we’re still referencing the boundaries Turing described. That’s a huge testament to the power of one paper published in the mid-1930s.</p>

</ul>



<h3><br><strong>2. “A Mathematical Theory of Communication” (1948)</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Author:</strong> Claude Shannon</p>



<p>Now that Turing showed us what machines can (and can’t) do, how do we actually move information around? Enter Claude Shannon, who basically invented <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory">information theory</a> so we could talk about bits, entropy, and noisy channels in a rigorous way.</p>



<h4><strong>The big idea</strong></h4>



<p>Shannon took the abstract notion of “information” and turned it into something a little <em>bit</em> (pun intended) more measurable. This helped us figure out how to pack data more efficiently (compression) and how to protect it from errors (error-correcting codes), whether we’re sending signals into space or streaming Netflix on a Friday night.</p>



<h4><strong>Why it matters today</strong></h4>



<p>Every single time you send a text, stream a video, or call your mom on FaceTime, you’re using Shannon’s ideas. Without them, you’d be dealing with a lot more scrambled audio and jumbled data, trust me.</p>

<h3><br><strong>3. “A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks” (1970)</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Author:</strong> Edgar F. Codd</p>



<p>So, we can compute and communicate — awesome. But eventually, we’re buried under mountains of data. Edgar F. Codd saw this coming and introduced the relational model, which is basically the reason we’re able to store and query data.</p>



<h4><strong>The big idea</strong></h4>



<p>Codd said, “Let’s store data in tables and manipulate it with logical operations.” This might sound obvious now, but at the time it was revolutionary. His blueprint led to SQL and the huge family of relational databases that power, oh, basically every bank, retail website, and enterprise system you can imagine.</p>



<h4><strong>Why it matters today</strong></h4>



<p>Even in the NoSQL era, the underlying concepts of how we organize data (tables, schemas, consistency) trace right back to Codd. If you ever wrote a SQL query in your life — it’s all thanks to him.</p>

<h3><br><strong>4. “The Complexity of Theorem-Proving Procedures” (1971)</strong></h3>



<div><p><strong>Author:</strong> Stephen A. Cook</p><p>Now that we’re storing data efficiently, what about the computation itself? Turns out some problems are just…painfully hard. Stephen Cook’s paper introduced NP-completeness, a concept that basically says, “Yep, some tasks are so difficult that even supercomputers sweat.”</p></div>



<h4><strong>The big idea</strong></h4>



<p>Cook showed that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem">Boolean satisfiability problem</a> (SAT) is NP-complete, meaning if you magically solve SAT quickly, you’ve instantly cracked a whole bunch of other seemingly impossible problems. This created a universal language for talking about problem difficulty.</p>

<p>Whenever you see “NP-hard” in a problem description, or wonder why route optimization kills your CPU, that’s Cook’s legacy. It led to huge developments in algorithms, cryptography, and the hunt for efficient solutions (or at least decent approximations).</p>

<h3><br><strong>5. “A Protocol for Packet Network Intercommunication” (1974)</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vinton G. Cerf and Robert E. Kahn</p>



<p>Great, we have tough problems to solve and data to store — but how do we hook all these computers together? Cerf and Kahn’s TCP turned isolated networks into an interconnected web, letting data hop around the planet in tiny packets.</p>



<h3><strong>The big idea</strong></h3>



<p>They created a universal language for different networks to talk. Packets get split up, zipped through various routes, and reassembled on the other side. This flexibility opened the door for global connectivity — no single monolithic network required.</p>



<h3><strong>Why it matters today</strong></h3>



<p>Short answer? Pretty much the entire internet. Whenever you browse the web, send an email, or securely log in to your bank’s website, you’re leaning on TCP/IP to move those bits around reliably. Sure, some real-time applications might use UDP, but the core idea of IP-based networking — laid out by Cerf and Kahn — still unites all our devices under one global network.</p>

<h3><br><strong>6. “Information Management: A Proposal” (1989)</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Author:</strong> Tim Berners-Lee</p>



<p>And speaking of TCP/IP — once machines could talk to each other easily, Tim Berners-Lee asked, “How about we make this thing friendly for everyone?” That’s where the World Wide Web was born.</p>



<h3><strong>The big idea</strong></h3>



<p>Berners-Lee pitched a global hypertext system, complete with hyperlinks, URLs, and HTTP. Suddenly, documents around the world were no longer isolated; they were “webbed” together, turning the internet into something normal people (not just scientists) could navigate.</p>



<h3><strong>Why it matters today</strong></h3>



<p>We live on the web. Whether it’s social media, online shopping, or reading obscure blog posts at 3 a.m., the seeds of it all came from this straightforward proposal. It changed how we share knowledge forever.</p>

<h3><br><strong>7. “The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine” (1998)</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sergey Brin and Larry Page</p>



<p>Once Berners-Lee’s web blew up, it became a jungle of links, pages, and cat memes. Sergey Brin and Larry Page decided to tame that jungle. Their approach, based on link analysis, evolved into the search engine we now call “Google.”</p>



<h3><strong>The big idea</strong></h3>



<p>They introduced PageRank, which viewed links as votes of confidence rather than just a new dimension to count keywords. The result was a seismic jump in relevant search results, making the web feel, well…searchable.</p>



<h3><strong><strong>Why it matters today</strong></strong></h3>



<p>Type a question into Google and get an instant answer? That’s PageRank (and a lot of subsequent innovation) at work. It redefined how we navigate information online and kicked off a new era of data-driven tech—ads, analytics, machine learning, you name it.</p>

<h2>Bonuses (5 That Almost Made the List)</h2>



<p>1. <strong>“Recursive Functions of Symbolic Expressions and Their Computation by Machine” (1960) – John McCarthy</strong></p>



<p>Introduced Lisp and the functional programming style that still sneaks into modern languages and frameworks.</p>



<p>2. <strong>“Go To Statement Considered Harmful” (1968) – Edsger Dijkstra</strong></p>



<p>A short but fiery editorial that argued <strong>goto</strong> leads to messy, unstructured code, sparking the structured programming revolution.</p>



<p>3. <strong>“Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System” (1978) – Leslie Lamport</strong></p>



<p>You can’t sync real clocks perfectly in distributed systems, so you need logical ones. This is a must-read if you’re into distributed computing.</p>



<p>4. <strong><strong>“No Silver Bullet—Essence and Accident in Software Engineering” (1986) – Fred Brooks</strong></strong></p>



<p>Brooks argued that there’s no single magical fix for the inherent complexity of software development. Decades later, as we chase the “next big thing” in frameworks or methodologies, his message remains a sobering reminder that some problems are just hard.</p>



<p>5. <strong>“Attention Is All You Need” (2017) – Vaswani et al.</strong></p>



<p>The transformer architecture behind GPT and other big-name AI models. If you’re impressed by large language models, here’s your blueprint.</p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>These days, we’re flooded with new stuff: fresh languages, mind-blowing AI breakthroughs, quantum leaps, and the JavaScript framework of the week. It’s all super exciting, but here’s the thing: foundations matter. Without them, we’re just piling on new toys without fully understanding the ground we’re building on. The papers in this post are a reminder of where our core concepts — data structures, algorithms, the very web — came from.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>With 2024 now behind us, we wanted to take a moment to reflect on the growth
and achievements we accomplished as a community last year, and celebrate the
incredible support we received from the FOSS community throughout the
journey.</p>

<p>This year has been a milestone for us, with significant strides in
decentralizing app distribution, expanding the F-Droid ecosystem, and
solidifying our infrastructure. All of these advancements were made possible
thanks to donations, grants, our volunteers and regular contributors. So
thank you again to everyone who helped make 2024 another great year for
F-Droid. Now let’s take a closer look at what we accomplished.</p>

<h2 id="a-review-of-key-accomplishments-in-2024">A Review of Key Accomplishments in 2024</h2>

<h3 id="decentralizing-app-distribution-a-core-focus">Decentralizing App Distribution: A Core Focus</h3>

<p>One of the most important initiatives we worked on in 2024 was the continued
development of our app decentralization efforts. Our aim is to make F-Droid
a more robust and accessible platform, making further in-roads into the hold
Big Tech currently has on app distribution.  Building on the <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/2022/02/05/decentralizing-distribution.html">work we
started in
2022</a>, as a
part of the <a href="https://www.ffdweb.org/blog/guardian-project-annoucement/">Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web
grant</a>, we
continued to make substantial progress this year in providing developers and
end-users with more options to distribute their apps through a
decentralized, equitable and privacy-oriented process. The goal for this
project is to enable individuals and organizations to mirror and distribute
F-Droid apps in a community-driven fashion, reducing reliance on centralized
services. This work ties into a larger vision of creating a truly
open-source ecosystem for Android apps that is not governed by proprietary
companies.</p>

<p>In 2024 we completed the following infrastructure upgrades:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Broke out and overhauled core client logic around publishing and consuming
repositories.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Made client logic into
<a href="https://f-droid.org/en/2023/05/02/three-client-libraries.html">libraries</a> to
make it easy to embed repositories in any app that needs it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Added support for mirroring repositories onto both IPFS and Filecoin.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Added support in F-Droid client to use mirrors and repositories hosted on
IPFS and Filecoin.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Improved F-Droid client “<a href="https://f-droid.org/en/docs/Whitelabel_Builds/">whitelabel
builds</a>”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enhanced F-Droid client’s existing “nearby” and “app swap” capabilities.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Updated F-Droid’s Repomaker tool (for easy “point and click” curation and
publishing of app repos) and add support for IPFS publishing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Supported iOS apps and progressive web apps (PWA) as packages that can be
shipped via repositories.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>2024 marked the end of this grant period, however the tools, features and
policies established within the scope of the grant, will continue to be
developed thanks to donations and other funders who are committed to further
decentralizing app distribution.</p>

<h2 id="expanding-the-f-droid-ecosystem-repomaker-and-mobifree">Expanding the F-Droid Ecosystem: Repomaker and Mobifree</h2>

<p>Another key project we
<a href="https://f-droid.org/en/2024/05/24/mobifree.html">started</a> in 2024 was the
further exploration and expansion of tools within the F-Droid
ecosystem. Thanks to a major grant from <a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101135795">EU Horizon
Europe</a>, we were able to
deepen our focus on tools like <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/repomaker/">Repomaker</a>,
which helps developers create their own F-Droid-compatible
repositories. This tool is crucial for maintaining and growing the diverse
range of apps available on F-Droid, and its expansion will support more
developers who wish to contribute to the platform.</p>

<p><a href="https://mobifree.org/">Mobifree</a> is an initiative that aims to provide a
free, open-source, and decentralized alternative to traditional mobile app
stores. It focuses on the freedom of choice, privacy, and user
empowerment. Our contributions to this project will help strengthen the ties
between F-Droid and other decentralized app distribution systems, ensuring
that we remain a key player in the future of open-source mobile software.</p>

<p>Do you have your own project ideas for Mobifree? You can apply for up to
50,000€ from <a href="https://nlnet.nl/mobifree/">NLnet NGI Mobifree</a>.  We can help
you apply, just reach out via the <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/about/#contact">regular F-Droid
channels</a>.</p>

<p>Key Contributions in 2024:</p>

<ul>
  <li>User research to understand app developer distribution workflows,
compensation models, index preferences and APK metadata.</li>
  <li>Built on existing Fastlane tooling to further automate the app package and
upload the process to F-Droid.</li>
  <li>Repomaker feature development made the repo creation and distribution
process easier for non-tech users, non-profit and humanitarian
organizations.</li>
  <li>Created a central registry of all DAPPER compatible repos and API for app
stores like Murena’s <a href="https://doc.e.foundation/app-lounge-main">App
Lounge</a> to pull in compatible
repos and further decentralize app distribution process.</li>
</ul>

<p>In 2025, we continue to contribute to the Mobifree project, getting our
tools, apps and software ready for pilot testing this spring. From there, we
will continue to improve the software based on user-testing feedback,
ultimately making the tools available for the general public to use and
enjoy.</p>



<p>None of this would be possible without the incredible contributions from the
FOSS community. In 2024, we saw a substantial increase in the number of
contributions to F-Droid. From bug fixes and app updates to new apps being
added to the store, our community of developers, testers, and contributors
have been pivotal in keeping F-Droid running smoothly.</p>

<p>Here are some statistics that highlight the community’s impact this year:</p>

<ul>
  <li>App Updates: Over 7205 app updates were made, keeping the app catalog
fresh and secure.</li>
  <li>New Apps Added: We welcomed over 402 new apps to the F-Droid repository,
further expanding the variety of open-source apps available to users.</li>
  <li>Archived Apps: 939 Apps were successfully archived.</li>
  <li>Packages per Hour: Approximately 2-3 packages were created every hour,
without interruption. Between updated and new apps, F-Droid built apps
over 7600 times. Since most modern apps are split per device architecture,
this means that each app version required multiple packages to be built,
sometimes up to 4 packages for each app version. This increases the real
number of builds by 2.5-3x. Putting it all together, that would equal
between 2-3 packages created per hour, without interruption in 2024.</li>
</ul>

<p>These numbers are a reflection of the dedication and passion of the F-Droid
community. We are immensely grateful for each and every contributor who made
these achievements possible.</p>

<h2 id="looking-ahead-in-2025">Looking Ahead in 2025</h2>

<h3 id="new-team-members-and-big-plans-for-2025">New Team Members and Big Plans for 2025</h3>

<p>As we look forward to 2025, we are excited to announce two key additions to
the F-Droid team who will help us scale our efforts in the coming
year. Hailey Still has joined us as a new project manager and UX
designer. Hailey brings a diverse background of experience in managing
complex projects and designing user-friendly and intuitive interfaces. Her
expertise will continue to be instrumental in helping us secure new grant
opportunities, streamline our operations and improve the user experience
tools we work on.</p>

<p>We are also pleased to welcome Nzambi Kakusu as our new grant
administrator. Nzambi will play a crucial role in helping us secure and
manage funding for F-Droid’s continued development. With her experience in
grant management, Nzambi will help ensure that we can continue to sustain
and grow the project in a way that aligns with our mission and values.</p>

<h3 id="otf-grant-and-infrastructure-work">OTF Grant and Infrastructure Work</h3>

<p>In 2025 we are thrilled to begin working on a grant funded by the <a href="https://www.opentech.fund/funds/free-and-open-source-software-sustainability-fund/">Open
Technology
Fund</a>.
This grant will help us maintain F-Droid and focus on critical
infrastructure work that was often overlooked, due to lack of consistent
funding in the past. We’ll be working on improving the resilience and
security of our systems, ensuring that F-Droid continues to serve as a
reliable, open-source app distribution platform for years to come. There
will be an official announcement article coming soon.</p>

<h2 id="to-wrap-it-up">To Wrap it Up</h2>

<p>As we continue to grow and evolve, we are committed to our mission of
decentralizing app distribution, expanding the F-Droid ecosystem, and
empowering users with open-source alternatives to proprietary software. With
the support of our community, our volunteers, and our new team members, we
are excited for what 2025 will bring.</p>

<p>Thank you for being part of the F-Droid journey!</p>

<p>We look forward to an exciting year ahead, and we invite you to continue
supporting F-Droid through <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/contribute/">contributions</a>,

  <div><p>Better late than never: last night a federal district court held that backdoor searches of databases full of Americans’ private communications collected under Section 702 ordinarily require a warrant. The landmark ruling comes in a criminal case, <a href="https://www.eff.org/cases/united-states-v-hasbajrami"><em>United States v. Hasbajrami</em></a>, after more than a decade of litigation, and over four years since the Second Circuit Court of Appeals <a href="https://cases.justia.com/federal/appellate-courts/ca2/15-2684/15-2684-2019-12-18.pdf?ts=1576692009">found</a> that backdoor searches constitute “separate Fourth Amendment events” and directed the district court to determine a warrant was required. Now, that has been officially decreed.</p>
<p>In the intervening years, Congress <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/04/us-senate-and-biden-administration-shamefully-renew-and-expand-fisa-section-702-0">has reauthorized</a> Section 702 multiple times, each time ignoring overwhelming evidence that the FBI and the intelligence community abuse their access to databases of warrantlessly collected messages and other data. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC), which Congress assigned with the primary role of judicial oversight of Section 702, has also <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/06/foreign-intelligence-surveillance-court-has-made-mockery-constitutional-right">repeatedly dismissed</a> arguments that the backdoor searches violate the Fourth Amendment, giving the intelligence community endless do-overs despite its <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/10/secret-court-rules-fbis-backdoor-searches-americans-violated-fourth-amendment">repeated transgressions</a> of even lax safeguards on these searches.</p>
<p>This decision sheds light on the government’s liberal use of what is essential a “finders keepers” rule regarding your communication data. As a legal authority, FISA Section 702 allows the intelligence community to collect a massive amount of communications data from overseas in the name of “national security.” But, in cases where one side of that conversation is a person on US soil, that data is still collected and retained in large databases searchable by federal law enforcement. Because the US-side of these communications is already collected and just sitting there, the government has claimed that law enforcement agencies do not need a warrant to sift through them. EFF argued for over a decade that this is unconstitutional, and now a federal court agrees with us.</p>
<p>EFF argued for over a decade that this is unconstitutional, and now a federal court agrees with us.</p>
<p><em>Hasbajrami </em>involves a U.S. resident who was arrested at New York JFK airport in 2011 on his way to Pakistan and charged with providing material support to terrorists. Only after his original conviction did the government explain that its case was premised in part on emails between Mr. Hasbajrami and an unnamed foreigner associated with terrorist groups, emails collected warrantless using Section 702 programs, placed in a database, then searched, again without a warrant, using terms related to Mr. Hasbajrami himself.</p>
<p>The district court found that regardless of whether the government can lawfully warrantlessly collect communications between foreigners and Americans using Section 702, it cannot ordinarily rely on a “foreign intelligence exception” to the Fourth Amendment’s warrant clause when searching these communications, as is the FBI’s routine practice. And, even if such an exception did apply, the court found that the intrusion on privacy caused by reading our most sensitive communications rendered these searches “unreasonable” under the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. In 2021 alone, the FBI conducted <a href="https://www.dni.gov/files/CLPT/documents/2022_ASTR_for_CY2020_FINAL.pdf">3.4 million warrantless</a> searches of US person’s 702 data.</p>
<p>In light of this ruling, we ask Congress to uphold its responsibility to protect civil rights and civil liberties by refusing to renew Section 702 absent a number of necessary reforms, including an official warrant requirement for querying US persons data and increased transparency. On April 15, 2026, Section 702 is set to expire. We expect any lawmaker worthy of that title to listen to what this federal court is saying and create a legislative warrant requirement so that the intelligence community does not continue to trample on the constitutionally protected rights to private communications. More immediately, the FISC should amend its rules for backdoor searches and require the FBI to seek a warrant before conducting them.</p>

But the risk of <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/caac.21689">damaging or deadly side effects<!-- --></a> is still present.<!-- --></p><p>Vozenin cites the example of paediatric brain tumours, which can often be cured by blasting the brain with radiotherapy, but at a great cost. "The survivors are often left with lifelong anxiety and depression, while the impact of the radiation affects brain development, causing significant loss of IQ," she says. "We're [sometimes] able to cure these kids but the price they pay is high."<!-- --></p><p>Billy Loo, a professor of radiation oncology who runs the Flash sciences lab at Stanford University School of Medicine in the US, explains that tumours, especially those of larger volume, are rarely neatly segregated from the surrounding tissue. This means it's often next to impossible to avoid harming healthy cells, so oncologists are often unable to use as high a dose as they would like, says Loo.<!-- --></p><p>Cancer specialists have long believed that being able to boost the radiation dose would greatly enhance their ability to cure patients with difficult-to-treat cancers, according to Vozenin. For example, research has previously indicated that being able to <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oncology/articles/10.3389/fonc.2020.576700/full">increase the radiation dose<!-- --></a> in lung cancer patients with tumours that have metastasised to the brain could improve survival.<!-- --></p><p>In recent years, animal studies have repeatedly shown that Flash makes it possible to markedly increase the amount of radiation delivered to the body while minimising the impact that it has on surrounding healthy tissue. In one experiment, healthy lab mice <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.07.08.602528v1.abstract">which were given two rounds of radiation via Flash<!-- --></a> did not develop the typical side effects which would be expected during the second round. In another study, animals <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://aacrjournals.org/mct/article/23/6/877/745462">treated with<!-- --></a> Flash for head and neck cancers experienced fewer side effects, such as reduced saliva production or difficulty swallowing.<!-- --></p><p>Loo is cautiously optimistic that going forwards, such benefits may also translate to human patients. "Flash produces less normal tissue injury than conventional irradiation, without compromising anti-tumour efficacy – which could be game-changing," he says. An additional hope is that this could then <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://onkder.org/pdf/pdf_TOD_1443.pdf">reduce the risk of secondary cancers<!-- --></a>, resulting from radiation-induced damage later in life, although it is still too early to know if that will be the case.<!-- --></p><p>Now, increasing numbers of human trials are beginning to take place around the world. Cincinnati Children's Hospital in Ohio, US, is <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05524064?intr=FLASH%20Radiotherapy&amp;rank=1">planning an early stage trial<!-- --></a> in children with metastatic cancer that has spread to their chest bones.

Instead of needing to repeatedly travel long distances over the course of many days and weeks to receive multiple radiotherapy sessions, Flash could enable them to receive it all in either a single session or a small handful of sessions. Because each treatment takes less than a second, it would also enable doctors to treat many more patients in a single day.<!-- --></p><p>"If we can get a normal sized machine that fits in all the hospital bunkers in the world and can administer Flash, that can allow countries to treat many more patients," says Durham Faivre.

<p>Imagine a skill-chart of qualities of technology: screen, audio, performance, build, tactility, touch-interaction, efficiency, size, and so many more. At the balancing point of all these qualities is the laptop. To that end, let’s build a laptop that hits as many qualities of a modern commercial thin &amp; light laptop—while trying to do as much from scratch as possible.</p>

<p><em>General system overview</em></p>
<h2 id="fermionic-analysis">Fermionic Analysis</h2>
<h3 id="choosing-the-chip">Choosing <em>the</em> chip</h3>
<p>I looked towards single-board computer SoCs, as board manufacturers commonly release schematics for reference. In many aspects, the Rockchip RK3588 is the fastest consumer-procurable chip on the market. Despite the spotty software support, the hardware documentation has lots of developer resources and <a href="https://wiki.friendlyelec.com/wiki/images/1/15/CM3588_NAS_SDK_2309_SCH.PDF" target="_blank">reference schematics</a> from SBC manufacturers.</p>
<p>Some quick specs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quad core A76 and quad core A55</li>
<li>Mali-G10 GPU</li>
<li>6TOPs NPU</li>
<li>8K@60FPS decoder</li>
<li>I/O: 8K display, dual USB3.1, PCIe 3.0 x 4, HDMI2.1/eDP 1.4, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>With only a few months to work on this project, an SoM (system on module) like the Raspberry Pi CM5 presented the best option for its hardware compatibility and a high likelihood of a snug integration. Choosing an SoM also alleviates memory and other high-speed signaling concerns. Looking around for a RK3588 SoM, I came across the CM3588 by FriendlyElec. Cheap, well-documented, and easily procurable. Sounds good!</p>
<img src="https://www.byran.ee/img/cm3588.jpg">

<h3 id="display">Display</h3>
<p>I hopped on <a href="https://www.panelook.com/" target="_blank">panelook.com</a> and filtered by size and resolution. I’ve always been a sucker for high pixel density, so I went with a 4K AMOLED 13.3” display. Cross referencing stock availability on Taobao (Chinese domestic Aliexpress), the <a href="https://www.panelook.com/ATNA33TP11_Samsung_13.3_OLED_parameter_59424.html" target="_blank">ATNA33TP11</a> seemed to be the one with most <em>brand-new</em> stock since OLED risked burn-in.</p>
<p>A highlight: during display evaluation, switching out a connector and shortening the board by 2mm improved signal integrity <em>just enough</em> for the 1.5GHz x 4 signals go pass through. Getting the display running on Linux meant finding system logs from Asus laptops that have this display, reverse-engineering the values, and tuning the power-on timings amongst other things <em>just right</em>. TLDR; getting a 4K AMOLED eDP display running on non-mainline Linux was a heck of a journey, so read <a href="">this if you’re interested</a> (coming soon).</p>

<h3 id="powertrain">Powertrain</h3>
<p>The cells had to be 6mm thin and four packs lined up should take roughly half of the entire chassis volume. Chinese manufacturers don’t stock batteries readily, and shipping them to the US would be a pain. Thus, I looked on the American side. I stumbled upon with <a href="https://www.batteryspace.com/polymerli-ionmodule37v4250mah157wh85arate-prewiredwithpcbpl5467100.aspx" target="_blank">these batteries</a> from AA Portable Power Corp. or batteryspace.com. or Powerizer. Doing the power calculations, we get: 4.250Ah <em>3.7V</em> 4S = 62.9 Wh with max 8A (so max 134.4W discharge)! Solid.</p>
<p>The total voltage is 4.2V (peak) * 4S = 16.8V. The system’s designed for up to 20V USB-C (AKA 100W) and passed into the <a href="https://www.ti.com/product/BQ25713" target="_blank">BQ25713</a> charging IC. The batteries are balanced with the <a href="https://www.ti.com/product/BQ77915" target="_blank">BQ77915</a> to ensure safe charging, and the power is tracked with an <a href="https://www.analog.com/en/products/ltc2943.html" target="_blank">LTC2943</a> to calculate a state-of-charge percentage. I popped in an ESP32-S3 module as the controller for everything, and set it to production.</p>
<p>After writing drivers and sitting on the undecipherable datasheets for days, I had the batteries charging. I successfully <a href="https://a.co/d/3b8R9mN" target="_blank">load tested</a> it to around 5A and powered the full system. There’s still a lot of quiescent current (about ~50mA), but I haven’t had the time to optimize the firmware.</p>
<p>The USB of the ESP32 connects to the internal USB on the motherboard to feed the power telemetry over UART. A Python script and kernel module in the OS forwards it to the battery service in the kernel to display it natively.</p>

<h3 id="mainboard">Mainboard</h3>
<p>With those decisions made up, I aimed for &gt;90mm motherboard width based on a prelim CAD from the batteries and display dimensions.</p>
<p>On the physical I/O side, I settled on dual USB3.1 Type-C ports, a USB2.0 Type-A port, a headphone jack, and a microSD card slot. Internally, the M.2 E-key connects to an <a href="https://a.co/d/4lJDnwX" target="_blank">RTL8852BE</a> WiFi 6 (802.11ax) + BT5.2 wireless card and the M.2 M-key accommodates up to an 2242-sized NVMe SSD. A full size NVMe SSD can fit with some modifications of the chassis too.</p>
<p>Tangent over, this leaves me with around ~90mm of board height. Implementing all the features on the final mainboard would stretch this writeup too long, so read <a href="">this if you’re interested</a> (coming soon).</p>

<p><em>Detailed hardware overview</em></p>
<h3 id="operating-on-a-system">Operating on a System</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Joshua-Riek/ubuntu-rockchip" target="_blank">Joshua Riek’s ubuntu-rockchip</a> kernel/distro combined an out-of-the-box experience with lots of optimizations. Using Armbian’s kernel (I believe it’s still off Rockchip’s kernel) meant that it offered nearly all the features of the RK3588 on a developer-ready kernel configuration.</p>
<p>Since nearly all the work I needed to do was abstracted in the DeviceTree (DTS) hardware configuration language implemented with U-boot, the bootloader, I took advantage of their system-agnostic nature to speed up my trial-and-error process having never done any Linux work.</p>
<p>Instead of developing and compiling code on the RK3588 itself, I used my daily driver MacBook and Visual Studio Code. Once I made a change in the DTS, I’d use Orbstack (virtualization software) running Ubuntu 24.04 (shared filesystem and kernel with macOS) and compile the DeviceTree there.</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="txt"><code><span><span>DTSI, DTS, and DTS Overlay Files (some for SoC, some for other ICs, etc.) -&gt; dtcpp binary (preprocessing &amp; linking various DeviceTree definitions) -&gt; dtc binary (DeviceTree compilation) -&gt; anyon_e.dtb (compiled DeviceTree binary!)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Pointing U-Boot to a custom compiled DTB (devicetree binary), I <code>scp</code>’ed the compiled <code>anyon_e.dtb</code> to the OS. A <code>u-boot-update</code> regenerates the bootloader configurations, and a reboot updates the changes.</p>
<p>That’s how I did the hardware bringup—display configurations, PCIe, USB, and other low-level system tweaks. The rest is just a standard install of Ubuntu 24.04 LTS with Linux Kernel 6.1.</p>

<h3 id="peripherals">Peripherals</h3>
<p>Imagine being able to just pull out your laptop’s keyboard and use it as just another wireless keyboard for literally anything! Just me? Maybe.</p>
<p>Being a mechanical keyboard addict with quite a few <a href="https://zmk.dev/" target="_blank">ZMK keyboards</a> designed, I chose the <a href="https://github.com/pashutk/Cherry_MX_ULP" target="_blank">Cherry MX ULP mechanical switches</a> for the best feel. Of course, a battery and fully mechanical switches add <em>a lot</em> of height. I used a 1mm thin <a href="https://www.powerstream.com/thin-lithium-ion.htm" target="_blank">200mAh battery</a> and a custom battery protection board that sticks up between two rows of keys to cut down on ~1.6mm (PCB height). The nRF52840 SoC running ZMK Firmware is right underneath the spacebar. A sandwich of PLA and 6061 aluminum from Fabworks crammed everything under ~7mm.</p>
<p>Since the keycaps aren’t easily procurable, I got a <a href="https://www.printedsolid.com/products/e3d-revo-nozzles?srsltid=AfmBOopKMJDs7gFpzrJg3kHQ-aJLDFTjeFO0ZJAYf1hADzy5iurNlkLB" target="_blank">0.15mm nozzle</a> for my Bambu Lab X1C and printed them with PLA. It got me down a rabbit hole of tungsten nozzles, and I got quoted ~$400 for 20x 0.15mm nozzles. I’ve been thinking of trying that out too. But alas, printing out all the keycaps and assembling for the last time, the keyboard was done.</p>
<p>Moving on to the trackpad, it was quite quick. I knew from the start that I wanted a good trackpad, so making my own with zero capacitive tracking experience is a no-go. Searching online, I came across the Azoteq <a href="https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Azoteq/PXM0057-401-S?qs=t7xnP681wgVkp9ZZYy6TPA%3D%3D" target="_blank">PXM0057-401</a> evaluation module on Mouser. It had it all—glass surface, multi-touch, and worked over USB. And, it was only 35 bucks or so. However, the trackpad has ceased production without many alternatives.</p>
<p>With the keyboard and trackpad working, it was time to put on the finishing touches.</p>

<p>Roughly the same time I began the system design, I sent a few CNC aluminum blocks off to JLC for evaluation with different anodization finishes. The dark gray anodization felt “best”, but I preferred the look of the matte black, so I settled on that.
Using PTC OnShape, I (attempted) CAD’ed a robust and minimalistic look and a blend of my two favorite laptop lineup designs, the Razer Blade and the MacBook Pro. Because of the removable keyboard, the bottom has no screws. Instead, the palm rest screws into the bottom chassis. <a href="https://cad.onshape.com/documents/a18bb6df7dbba66df24a7ec8/w/967d921e60c207e3b6f5cf7b/e/1f78a9387b17c2d178742295?renderMode=0&amp;uiState=678da20d5bee0d1ad2dd55f1" target="_blank">CAD Link here.</a></p>
<p>The hardest part about the chassis was the hinge. I used <a href="https://frame.work/products/display-hinge-kit?v=FRANFB0001" target="_blank">Framework’s 13.3” hinge</a> because it has a 3D model. I constrained it in OnShape so I can see the exact closing angles.</p>
<p>The chassis layout is fairly simple: batteries on the bottom, the power board on the right, motherboard on the left, and the hinge mechanism on top. Oh, and a transparent PETG FDM printed power button that lights up on a custom PCB. To balance out the asymmetric hinge (caused by the mainboard being too wide), a little <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/2153T11/" target="_blank">carbon fiber rod</a> lines up on the left side too.</p>
<img src="https://www.byran.ee/img/chassis_empty.jpg">
<p><em>Chassis test fitting</em></p>
<p>It was a battle to get the screen assembly to not hit anything while also covering
Although I started considering thermals way in advance, hence the gap here for the heatpipe to go through, I still had difficulty fitting everything in. The distance between the bottom of the keyboard and the top of the heatsink is less than a half a millimeter. The cooling system is really constrained because I don’t have the resources to make a custom heatpipe and fin solution. So, I made a full copper CNC heatsink (from JLCCNC) and a heatpipe connected to a fan. It’s all connected with <a href="https://www.lttstore.com/products/ptm7950-phase-change-thermal-pad" target="_blank">PTM7950</a>.</p>
<p>I also added <a href="https://puiaudio.com/product/speakers-and-receivers/as04004mo-sp40" target="_blank">these</a> PUI audio speakers on either side. The audio from the CM3588’s DAC didn’t work and I ran out of debugging time, so I made a USB to audio converter board separately and shot it through an Class-D amplifier. I would’ve also made the amp, but I ran out of time.</p>
<p>As I reached final assembly, I used a mix of JLC’s selective laser sintering (SLS) of nylon powder and FDM printed PA6-CF for smaller structural parts. Putting it all together with the matte black CNC aluminum chassis, I finally had my laptop.</p>

<h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>
<p>The hardest class I’ve taken so far was quantum mechanics in my junior spring term. A few months before spending hours solving time-independent and dependent Schrödinger equations, I was on the squash bus (the sport, not the vegetable). My friend suggested I make a laptop for my senior project—and that was all.
I came up with the name anyon_e in June, after I finished the quantum course.</p>
<p>Making this laptop was hard. Mentally pressured with a deadline, and a constant inter-disciplinary challenge across electrical, software, and mechanical systems. Summing up everything I’ve ever done. It took up most of my mind from May until now.</p>

  <p><em>I work from home everyday, I am susceptible to eye strain, eye pain, and dizziness. Having a working environment that’s as easy on my eyes as possible is of critical importance. I hope that by sharing what I've learned, it can be helpful to you if you work from home, and like many, have experienced WFH eye strain.</em></p><p><em>Disclaimer: I'm not an ergonomist or optometrist. These tips are intended to help improve your work from home comfort based on my own personal experience.</em></p></div><h2><strong>TLDR</strong></h2><div>
  <ol><li>An even, diffused lighting environment is best for the eyes</li><li>When it comes to light brightness, too much is just as problematic as too little</li><li>Use natural light wherever possible&nbsp;</li><li>Quality of artificial light matters</li><li>The best lighting for camera, is not necessarily the best lighting for ergonomics</li><li>Even the perfect lighting environment will fatigue you — take breaks, and take care of yourself</li></ol></div>

<hr><h2>What is it about computer screens that makes them fatiguing?</h2><h6>Monitor flicker</h6>
<p>Most monitors have some level of flicker. This flickering is generally not visually noticeable, but can still be fatiguing. Monitors at lower brightness levels exhibit more flicker - as they use PWM dimming (Pulse Width Modulation). In some monitors this is done by changing the ON/OFF intervals, increasing OFF timing, and lowering ON timing — while maintaining the same brightness! This creates an awful strobe-effect, and can be very exhausting — especially when working in an environment where the monitor is the sole light source.</p><h6>High contrast lighting</h6>
<p>High contrast lighting can exist in a few different formats. It can exist as <strong>glare</strong> — that is for example light coming in from a window, into a dark room, illuminating a part of your desk. This glare is fatiguing on your eyes because they are accommodating for two levels of brightness simultaneously, while also trying to conduct tasks on a computer monitor — such as reading. High contrast can also exist in a room with bright light on the left, and darkness on the right. This is fatiguing for your eyes to compensate for.</p><h6>Fixed focal distance</h6>
<p>When working at a computer, most of the time <em>we, </em>and the <em>monitor </em>don't move significantly. We focus at the same distances for long periods of time. This causes our eye muscles to get tight and overworked. This can cause our eyes to get tired, spasm, or sometimes even make it very hard to relax our eyes. Although improved office lighting can help with this, the main way to solve for this problem is to take breaks practicing the 20/20/20 rule: Every 20 minutes, look up from your screen and focus on something approximately 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds.</p>
<hr><h2>My setup before</h2><h4>Daytime</h4>
<p>Light in the office primarily comes in from the sun. The direct light causes glare, and because of the lack of diffusion, makes for dark corners in the room. Even with a light overhead, it's not enough to equal the amount from outside. This results in high contrast, dark spots behind the monitor, and harsh shadows. Blackout curtains are of little help because they only serve to reduce the size of the light coming in, as opposed to aiding with diffusion. Anytime it's dark outside, it's like working at night. Not fun.</p>

    Daylight is harsh and direct, creating glare or harsh shadows. The lack of diffused light makes for dark spots in the office.  </figcaption>
  </figure>

<hr><h4>Nighttime</h4>
<p>Light primarily comes from above. Because of this single light source, it makes for harsh shadows, dark spots, and high contrast. The contrast issue is particularly apparent with the monitor, which although can be dimmed, creates a bright monitor, which also self-shades the wall behind resulting in a dark background.</p>

    Light levels are now much more balanced, with less blown out light, and less harsh shadows. In addition, corners of the room are illuminated and counter-balance the light from above and from the monitor. Backlighting and desk-lighting help to create a relaxing, low contrast task environment.  </figcaption>

<hr><h3>What's changed</h3><h5>Window light sources, and filtering light</h5>
<div><p>Windows now have light-filtering curtains, which helps to not only reduce the amount of light on bright days, but also to heavily diffuse the light coming in, which makes for a beautiful glow in the room. In addition, I've installed wood-blinds (not shown) behind the curtains which helps to further control the amount of light entering the office on very bright days.</p><p><em>Products used: Sheer curtains • Wood Blinds</em></p></div><h5>Wall &amp; ceiling lighting</h5>
<div>
  <p>Each corner of the room now has a torchiere lamp, which helps to create an even lighting environment. These lamps point directly up and light the room indirectly through reflections off of the walls and ceiling. In the center of the ceiling, a fabric wrapped light fixture provides  diffused lighting. This light is dimmable and can be adjusted to match the amount of light from the standing lamps. </p><p><em>Products used: IKEA NOT Lamp (Discontinued but </em><a href="https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/tagarp-floor-uplighter-black-white-60464049/"><em>TAGARP is comparable</em></a><em>) • </em><a href="https://www.homedepot.ca/product/philips-ultradefinition-led-a19-e26-60w-equivalent-light-bulb-dimmable-soft-white-2700k-2-pack/1001664067?eid=PS_GO_140203__ALL_PLA-526641&amp;eid=ds_ads_van_27772_FY24%20%7C%20MS%20%7C%20Always%20on%20%7C%20Google%20Shopping&amp;pid=1001664067&amp;store=7158&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=vantage&amp;utm_campaign=25029&amp;utm_content=26766&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAxea5BhBeEiwAh4t5K7JuMnZCfX-pH8h00lhpixTdd7IHwLgyH18hfcewKmL6MXn-lSnxUhoCPCUQAvD_BwE#reviews"><em>Philipps Ultra Definition LED Soft White (Glass)</em></a></p></div><h5>Desk lighting</h5>
<div>
  <p>The desk now has even lighting. The brightness of the monitor is now matched by a dimmable flicker-free backlight, which makes working at the display less fatiguing. In addition, a monitor lightbar (not shown), provides indirect light to the desk, reflected off the surface which is completely dimmable and flicker-free. These two lights together help to make for an even lighting environment during the day, and a calm and cozy environment at night. In addition to the two lights, the Apple Studio display has an ambient light sensor, which adjusts the brightness to match the ambient light, which is a game changer for light sensitive people. </p><p><em>Products used: </em><a href="https://www.benq.com/en-ca/lighting/monitor-light/screenbar-plus.html" target="_blank" title="BenQ Screenbar Plus"><em>BenQ ScreenBar Plus</em></a><em> • Warm White LED Strips • </em><a href="https://store.waveformlighting.com/products/filmgrade-flicker-free-dimmer-for-led-strip#:~:text=Waveform%20Lighting's%20innovative%20flicker%2Dfree,an%20existing%20LED%20system%20setup." title="Waveform Flicker-Free LED Dimmer"><em>WaveForm Flicker-Free </em></a><a href="https://store.waveformlighting.com/products/filmgrade-flicker-free-dimmer-for-led-strip#:~:text=Waveform%20Lighting's%20innovative%20flicker%2Dfree,an%20existing%20LED%20system%20setup." target="_blank" title="Waveform Flicker-Free LED Dimmer"><em>LED</em></a><a href="https://store.waveformlighting.com/products/filmgrade-flicker-free-dimmer-for-led-strip#:~:text=Waveform%20Lighting's%20innovative%20flicker%2Dfree,an%20existing%20LED%20system%20setup." title="Waveform Flicker-Free LED Dimmer"><em> Dimmer</em></a></p></div>
<hr><h2>Takeaways</h2>
<div>
  <ol><li><p><strong>An even, diffused lighting environment is best for the eyes. </strong>Try to balance out dark/light spots with additional lighting, and diffusing strong light sources — like the sun.<br></p></li><li><p><strong>When it comes to light brightness, too much is just as problematic as too little. </strong>When dealing with too little light, add additional light sources which provide indirect, and reflective lights — such as up-lights, or torchieres, or lights that have a shade. When dealing with too much light — use blinds, sheer curtains, or light filtering curtains. If you have too much light from an artificial source, use lower wattage bulbs, or consider adding a dimmer switch.<br></p></li><li><p><strong>Use natural light wherever possible. </strong>If you've got natural light, use it to your advantage. Natural light is healthier than artificial light — there's no flicker, and it can provide us with much needed vitamin D. For rooms with small windows, use mirrors to help reflect natural light and fill the room. <br></p></li><li><p><strong>Quality of Artificial Light Matters. </strong>Wherever possible seek out high quality lighting that is dimmable and flicker-free. Spending a few extra dollars for these products is worth it, and it will result in less fatigue. For regular bulbs, I recommend <a href="https://www.homedepot.ca/product/philips-ultradefinition-led-a19-e26-60w-equivalent-light-bulb-dimmable-soft-white-2700k-2-pack/1001664067?eid=PS_GO_140203__ALL_PLA-526641&amp;eid=ds_ads_van_27772_FY24%20%7C%20MS%20%7C%20Always%20on%20%7C%20Google%20Shopping&amp;pid=1001664067&amp;store=7158&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=vantage&amp;utm_campaign=25029&amp;utm_content=26766&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAxea5BhBeEiwAh4t5K7JuMnZCfX-pH8h00lhpixTdd7IHwLgyH18hfcewKmL6MXn-lSnxUhoCPCUQAvD_BwE#reviews"><em>Philipps Ultra Definition LED Soft White</em></a><em> </em>bulbs which have low flicker rates, glass enclosures, high color rendering index, and a relatively inexpensive pricepoint.<br></p></li><li><p><strong>The best lighting for camera, is not necessarily the best lighting for ergonomics. </strong>When working from home, we spend a lot of time on video calls, and it's natural to want to look our best. Studio lights that attach to our desks, or facing a window outdoor will result in great lighting on camera, but can also cause fatigue. Consider reserving this lighting for calls, or see if generally better room lighting can result in a similar light quality on camera.<strong><br></strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Even the perfect lighting environment will fatigue you — take breaks, and think beyond lighting! </strong>Having a great lighting environment will help you with stamina, but having good work habits like the 20/20/20 rule, and changing up posture and working environments are important in order to take the best care of your eyes, and your body. Think beyond lighting when considering ergonomics, such as room humidity (to limit dry eye), posture, chair position, and stay moving to keep blood flowing.<br></p></li></ol></div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>Developing a multiplayer third-person shooter game as a solo developer is a journey filled with challenges and
rewards. I embarked on this adventure to create <strong>Wizard Masters</strong>, a web-based multiplayer game where players battle as
mages wielding elemental spells.</p><p>Built using <strong>Clojure</strong>, a Lisp dialect, this project pushed the boundaries of web game
development and my own skills as a programmer. Here’s how it went.</p><p>In Wizard Masters, players can choose from six elemental spells—fire, toxic, ice, lightning, and earth—and compete in
two modes: solo and team deathmatch. I published the game on CrazyGames to reach a broader audience. However, its
multiplayer nature demanded a large player base, which was a constant challenge.</p><p>Game Link: <a href="https://wizardmasters.io/">https://wizardmasters.io</a></p><h3 id="why-clojure">Why Clojure?</h3><p>Clojure is my go-to programming language, both professionally and personally. It’s a full-stack language:</p><ul><li>Clojure runs on the JVM for backend development.</li><li>ClojureScript compiles to JavaScript, enabling smooth browser-based applications.</li></ul><p>This one language to rule them all approach made it an obvious choice for me. Additionally, Clojure’s REPL <em>(
Read-Eval-Print Loop)</em> system is a game-changer. Unlike typical REPLs, Clojure’s REPL is highly interactive and organic,
allowing live updates to the game without refreshing the browser. This significantly sped up my development process,
enabling me to create and test mechanics in real time.</p><p>I created a YouTube video showing how to use the REPL with jMonkeyEngine, a Java-based game framework. You
can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOPz9I49snM">watch it here</a>.</p><h3 id="graphics-library">Graphics Library</h3><p>After experimenting with several graphics libraries, including Three.js and PlayCanvas, I chose Babylon.js. Here’s why:</p><ul><li>Feature-rich: Babylon.js offers a robust set of tools for 3D development.</li><li>Great documentation: Compared to other libraries, Babylon’s documentation stands out for its clarity and
comprehensiveness.</li><li>Supportive community: The community’s assistance proved invaluable.</li></ul><p>ClojureScript’s npm integration through <strong>shadow-cljs</strong> made it easy to incorporate Babylon.js, allowing me to focus on
building the game.</p><h3 id="code">Code</h3><p>The following code snippet showcases the implementation of a <code>:player/jump</code> rule, which handles the player’s ability to
jump in the game. This rule uses a <code>:what</code> block, essentially a hashmap, to define the conditions under which the rule
is triggered.</p><p>In <strong>Wizard Masters</strong>, all game data resides in a global game database—a single large hashmap. The fields referenced in
the :what block (e.g., :pointer-locked?, :player/ground?) are keys in this global hashmap. To execute the rule, several
conditions must be met:</p><ol><li>Each key in the <code>:what</code> block must have a non-null value.</li><li>The <code>:when</code> block must evaluate to true.</li><li>The <code>:then</code> block is executed when the above conditions are satisfied.</li></ol><p>The triggering of this rule occurs through the fire-rules function, which activates the rule whenever a <code>:what</code> field is
updated, regardless of whether the value changes. If a field has a <code>:then false</code> attribute, the rule will not trigger,
avoiding infinite loops and unnecessary executions. The rule system was influenced by the Clojure library <strong>O’Doyle
Rules by Zach Oakes</strong>.</p><p>Here’s the complete implementation for the <code>:player/jump</code> rule:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="clojure"><span><span><span>(</span><span>reg-rule</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The process begins by filtering players to identify those in the same room, excluding teammates, and checking if they
are within the spell’s radius or cylindrical area. Once the affected players are identified, the damage is calculated,
decreasing with distance from the spell’s origin while ensuring it is positive and does not exceed a player’s current
health. Finally, the game state is updated by deducting the damage from each player’s health, marking players as “dead”
if their health reaches zero, notifying affected players of the damage, and updating the attacker’s stats accordingly.</p><p>The backend handles real-time complexity by continuously updating multiple players and ensuring synchronization across
all devices. Events such as spellcasting and deaths are processed asynchronously through queues to maintain performance.
Developing custom networking code from scratch was both challenging and educational, offering valuable insights into the
trade-offs between control and complexity.</p><h3 id="the-journey">The Journey</h3><p>At the beginning of my game development journey, everything felt fantastic. I was quickly iterating through features,
mechanics, and UI development, making substantial progress in short bursts. However, as the project grew, it became
increasingly challenging to manage. The difficulty wasn’t directly tied to Clojure’s nature—there were many other
contributing factors.</p><p>Game development is fundamentally an art of state management. States are everywhere, and managing numerous unrelated
systems in harmony is a challenging task. While Clojure’s immutability by default offers many advantages, it also
introduces complexity. To handle the intricate state management required for game development, I had to create my own
abstractions. Writing a custom DSL (domain-specific language) became a necessity, but it wasn’t easy.</p><p>Adding to the challenge was the lack of a strong Clojure game development community. While Clojure excels in domains
like SaaS products and finance, its adoption in game development is virtually nonexistent. The absence of shared tools,
libraries, and best practices in this space made the journey even more isolating.</p><p>I couldn’t help but feel envious of the tooling ecosystems surrounding major game engines like Unity and Unreal Engine.
While Babylon.js is a great library, it lacks the robust plugin ecosystems, frameworks, and tools that mainstream
engines offer. Developing with Babylon.js often meant building tools from scratch. While this taught me a lot about
graphics programming, it came at the cost of time—a critical resource in modern game development.</p><p>Good tooling is a cornerstone of game development today. The lack of it left me feeling perpetually one step behind.</p><p>Developing 3D games for the web comes with inherent limitations. While WebGL has improved significantly, and WebGPU is
on the horizon, web-based games are still far behind native games in terms of performance and graphical fidelity. These
limitations force developers to make compromises.</p><p>Resource constraints on the web are another hurdle. Users expect quick load times and minimal downloads. Asking players
to wait for a 500MB download before they can play is unrealistic. This restricts web games to being small, free, and
often simplistic. The result? Web games rarely rival the scale or polish of PC or console games.</p><p>Financially, web game development doesn’t make much sense. Monetization options are limited, with ads being the primary
choice. But ads disrupt immersion and often force you to design your game around them just to earn a modest income.</p><p>The web game market is tiny compared to PC and console markets. While there are a few success stories like Agar.io and
Wordle. Only a couple of major web game publishers, like <em>CrazyGames</em> and <em>Poki</em>, exist. Rejection from these platforms
can make it nearly impossible to reach a large audience. To sustain yourself financially, you’d need to create a high
volume of games in a short period, which is neither practical nor creatively satisfying.</p><p>The one advantage web games have is ease of distribution. Sharing a link is all it takes for anyone to jump in and start
playing. But this strength alone doesn’t compensate for the many weaknesses.</p><p>Making a game is hard; making a successful game is even harder. Creating a good game is like cooking a great meal—you
can do wonders with a handful of ingredients or fail miserably with a dozen. There’s no single formula for success.
Everything needs to align: timing, optimization, art, sound, trends, and theme.</p><p>A few years ago, the battle royale trend exploded, leading to a flood of games trying to capitalize on the craze. Even
great games like Spellbreak couldn’t sustain themselves. But following trends isn’t inherently bad; it’s about

<p>We’re in the process of porting a significant portion of the network I/O code
            in EdgeDB from Python to Rust, and we’ve been learning a lot of very
            interesting lessons in the process.</p>
<div data-section-id="the-crash-that-only-happened-on-arm64" id="the-crash-that-only-happened-on-arm64">

<p>We’ve been working on a new HTTP fetch feature for EdgeDB, using <code>reqwest</code>
                as our HTTP client library. Everything was going smoothly: the feature
                worked locally, passed tests on x86_64 CI runners, and seemed stable.
                But then we noticed something strange: the tests started failing
                intermittently on our ARM64 CI runners.</p>
<p>At first glance, it looked like a deadlock. The test runner would start,
                hang indefinitely, and then the CI job would time out. The logs showed no
                errors—just a test spinning forever. And then, after a few hours, the job
                would fail with a timeout error.</p>
<p>Here’s what the CI output looked like:</p>
<div translate="no"><pre><span>Current runner version: '2.321.0'
Runner name: '&lt;instance-id&gt;'
Runner group name: 'Default'

(... 6 hrs of logs ...)

still running:

still running:
test_immediate_connection_drop_streaming (pid=451) for 19877.78s

Shutting down test cluster...</span></pre></div>
<p>Not much to go on here. It looked like a deadlock causing an async task to
                improperly block to us at first. It turns out we were wrong.</p>
</div>
<div data-section-id="initial-theories" id="initial-theories">

<p>Why just ARM64? This didn’t make a lot of sense to us in the beginning.
                Our first theories were in the difference of memory models between Intel and
                ARM64. Intel has a fairly strict memory model—while some unusual behaviors
                can happen, memory writes have a total order that all processors agree on
                (<a href="https://www.msully.net/blog/2015/02/25/the-x86-memory-model/">[1]</a>, <a href="https://research.swtch.com/hwmm">[2]</a>, <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/weakmemory/x86tso-paper.tphols.pdf">[3]</a>).
                ARM has a much more weakly-ordered memory model <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1353522.1353528">[4]</a>, where
                (among other things) writes may appear in different orders to different
                threads.</p>
<p>Since Sully’s Ph.D. thesis was on this stuff <a href="https://www.msully.net/thesis/">[5]</a>,
                this is when he got pulled in to take a look.</p>
</div>
<div data-section-id="debugging-on-the-ci-machine" id="debugging-on-the-ci-machine">

<p>Our nightly CI machines run on Amazon AWS, which has the advantage of giving
                us a real, uncontainerized root user. While you can connect github runners via
                ssh <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/ssh-to-github-action-runner">[6]</a>, it’s
                nice to have the ability to connect as the true root user to get access to
                dmesg and other system logs.</p>
<p>To figure out what was going on, we (Sully and Matt) decided to connect
                directly to the ARM64 runner and see what was happening under the hood.</p>
<p>First, we SSH’d into the CI machine to try and find that hung process
                to connect to it:</p>
<div translate="no"><pre><span>$ aws ssm start-session --region us-west-2 --target i-&lt;instance-id&gt;
$ ps aux | grep "451"
&lt;no output&gt;</span></pre></div>
<p>Oh, that’s right! We run the build in a Docker container and it has its own
                process namespace:</p>
<div translate="no"><pre><span>$ sudo docker exec -it &lt;container-id&gt; /bin/sh
# ps aux | grep "451"
&lt;no output&gt;</span></pre></div>
<p>Wait, hold on. The hung process isn’t there either.</p>
<p>This wasn’t a deadlock — the process had crashed.</p>
<p>It turns out our test runner failed to detect this—but that’s fine, and a fix
                for another day. We can see if the process left a coredump. Since a Docker
                container is just a process namespace, the core dump gets passed to the Docker
                host itself. We can try to find that from outside the container with
                <code>journalctl</code>:</p>
<div translate="no"><pre><span>$ sudo journalctl
systemd-coredump: Process 59530 (python3) of user 1000 dumped core.
                  Stack trace of thread &lt;tid&gt;:
                  ...</span></pre></div>
<p>Aha! We found it. And the core for that process lives in
                <code>/var/lib/systemd/coredump/</code> as expected. Note that we see a different pid
                here because of process namespaces: the pid outside of the container (59530)
                is different than the one inside (1000).</p>
<p>We loaded the core dump into <code>gdb</code> to see what happened. Unfortunately,
                we were greeted with a number of errors:</p>
<div translate="no"><pre><span>$ gdb

Backtrace stopped: not enough registers or memory available to unwind further</span></pre></div>
<p>Ack. That’s not useful. We don’t have the necessary files outside of the
                container, and our containers are quite minimal and don’t allow us to easily
                install <code>gdb</code>.</p>
<p>Instead, we need to copy the relevant libraries out of the container,
                and tell <code>gdb</code> where the <code>.so</code> files live:</p>
<div translate="no"><pre><span># mkdir /container
# docker cp &lt;instance&gt;:/lib /container
# docker cp &lt;instance&gt;:/usr /container

<p>Much better!</p>
<p>But rather than a crash in our new HTTP code, the backtrace revealed
                something unexpected:</p>

 End of assembler dump.</span></pre></div>
<p>Huh, so it’s crashing when loading a byte while scanning for the environment
                variable of interest.</p>
<p>We can dump the current state of all the registers:</p>
<div translate="no"><pre><span>(gdb) info reg
...
x19            0x220               544
x20            0x248b5000          613109760

pc             0xffff805a3e90      0xffff805a3e90</span></pre></div>
<p>So <code>getenv</code> was crashing trying to load from an invalid memory location
                (<code>0x220</code> – a clearly invalid memory value). But how?</p>
</div>
<div data-section-id="what-was-happening" id="what-was-happening">

<p>At first, we were stumped. The crash was happening deep inside <code>libc</code>.
                We suspected something to do with environment variable corruption, given
                the call to <code>getenv</code>, but there wasn’t enough information to go on.</p>
<p>We started inspecting the environment block using <code>gdb</code>.</p>
<p>As a refresher, <code>environ</code> is defined as a <code>char **</code> by the POSIX
                standard <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/environ.7.html">[8]</a>, and is effectively an list of pointers to environment
                strings, with the end of the list marked as a <code>NULL</code> pointer.</p>
<div translate="no"><pre><span>(gdb) x/s ((char**) environ)[0]
0xffffddd95e6a: "GITHUB_STATE=/github/file_commands/save_state_0e5b7bd6-..."

(gdb) x/s ((char**) environ)[68]
0x0:    &lt;error: Cannot access memory at address 0x0&gt;
&lt;etc&gt;</span></pre></div>
<p>But it didn’t make sense—we were seeing a load from a space of memory that
                should not be possible, and the environment here seems to be completely valid
                and consistent. And exactly why were we calling <code>getenv</code> here?</p>
<p>And then Yury dropped in with a comment and link to an old blog post:</p>
<div translate="no"><pre><span>&lt;yury&gt; Some file IO related operation seem to error out,
       and Python attempts to construct an exception from
       errno with PyErr_SetFromErrnoWithFilenameObjects

&lt;yury&gt; which probably checks on gettext (translation hook?)
       which goes into getenv

&lt;yury&gt; this could be why -- getenv isn't threadsafe
       https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2017/01/30/env/</span></pre></div>

<h2 id="the-real-culprit-setenv-and-getenv">The Real Culprit: setenv and getenv</h2>
<p><code>setenv</code> is not a safe function to call in a multithreaded environment.
                This is often a problem, and occasionally rediscovered as developers like us
                hit weird crashes in libc’s <code>getenv</code>
<a href="https://www.evanjones.ca/setenv-is-not-thread-safe.html">[9]</a>, <a href="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2017/01/30/env/">[10]</a>,
                <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/63567">[11]</a>, <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/mcatanzaro/2018/02/28/on-setenv-and-explosions/">[12]</a>.</p>
<p>This seemed like a possible cause, but given the lack of symbols here,
                we couldn’t understand how the threads that were running could contribute
                to that crash.</p>
<p>Reading the disassembly, and cross-referencing it with the C code, we
                determined that the register <code>x20</code> corresponded with the variable <code>ep</code>,
                the pointer used to walk through the <code>environ</code> array. But <code>x20</code>
                was <code>0x248b5000</code>, and <code>environ</code> was <code>0x28655750</code>, almost
                60 megabytes later in memory.</p>
<p>Since <code>x20</code> is the pointer being used to read the old environment,
                we could look at the surrounding memory to see if anything sensible
                is still there, and could then compare that to the current <code>environ</code>.</p>

<p>Interesting! The pointer values in the two areas of memory are very similar!
                And where do they start to differ? The final entries at <code>0x0000ffff6401f0b0</code>
                and <code>0x0000ffff6401f8d0</code>: corresponding to <code>SSL_CERT_FILE=...</code>
                and  <code>SSL_CERT_DIR=...</code>!</p>
<p>This was a clear hint that the race condition idea was right, and another
                thread was moving <code>environ</code> as part of a call to <code>setenv</code>! Looking at
                <code>setenv</code>, it seemed that the space of memory holding the environment block
                is too small, and it might have been reallocated to fit the new variables
                <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/glibc/glibc-2.17.90/source/stdlib/setenv.c#L33">[13]</a>.</p>
<p>That still left us with the question of how to find what code is calling
                <code>setenv</code>. It seemed like it could be possible that OpenSSL and/or one of
                <code>reqwest</code>’s other TLS-related dependencies (<code>rust-native-tls</code>) was
                causing the crash, but how?</p>
</div>
<div data-section-id="the-connection-to-openssl-probe" id="the-connection-to-openssl-probe">

<p>A google search for those environment variables in concert with
                <code>rust-native-tls</code> pulled up an old issue: <a href="https://github.com/sfackler/rust-native-tls/issues/154">[14]</a>. And hidden in one of
                the comments was this:</p>
<div translate="no"><pre><span>Not sure about openssl. It looks like it currently
loads the system certs by using openssl-probe to set
the SSL_CERT_FILE and SSL_CERT_DIR environment variables,
and then relies on SslConnector::builder to call
ctx.set_default_verify_paths, which looks at those
environment variables. Given that the environment variables
are set globally once, it might be best to just try to clear
the store afterwards. This seemed to work for me locally:</span></pre></div>
<p>Interesting. So <code>openssl-probe</code> sets those variables. And sure enough,
                we’re using the <code>rust-native-tls</code>
<code>openssl</code> backend on Linux which calls
                into these functions!</p>
<p>Here’s the unsafe-free, completely-innocent-looking offending lines from the
                <code>openssl-probe</code> library <a href="https://github.com/alexcrichton/openssl-probe/blob/db67c9e5b333b1b4164467b17f5d99207fad004c/src/lib.rs#L65-L76">[15]</a>:</p>

<p>And that’s how we ended up with a crash, caused by <code>unsafe</code>-free Rust
                code badly interacting with the use of <code>libc</code> elsewhere in the program.</p>
</div>
<div data-section-id="an-aside-what-even-is-risc" id="an-aside-what-even-is-risc">

<p>While we both had experience with reverse engineering, our aarch64 assembly
                skills were either rusty (Matt) or nonexistent (Sully), and so we spent
                some time confused about one of the main loops in the assembly. The code
                seemed to expect <code>x20</code> to be changing, and it was the clearest candidate
                to be the register representing <code>ep</code>, but it didn’t appear on the left
                hand side of any instruction.</p>
<p>Then we noticed a curious exclamation mark:</p>
<div translate="no"><pre><span>0x0000ffff805a3e88 &lt;+164&gt;:   ldr     x19, [x20, #8]!</span></pre></div>
<p>It turns out this is the “pre-index” address mode, which behaves like
                <code>x19 = *(x20 + 8); x20 = x20 + 8</code>
<a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/102374/0102/Loads-and-stores---addressing">[16]</a>.</p>
<p>This is a cute little operator, but we are old enough to remember being told
                that auto-increment address modes were a legacy of old-school CISC machines
                like the VAX, eschewed even by more modern CISC machines like x86, and certainly
                by the elegant and simple RISC designs. Everything old is new again, I suppose.</p>
</div>
<div data-section-id="so-why-only-arm64-linux" id="so-why-only-arm64-linux">

<p>Because this crash is caused by a memory-moving <code>realloc</code>, triggered by
                <code>setenv</code> which happens at the same time another thread is calling <code>getenv</code>,
                it requires a lot of pieces to fall into the right place. The number of
                environment variables needs to be just right to cause a realloc.
                An unrelated I/O failure picked up by <code>asyncio</code> needs to call <code>getenv</code> to
                retrieve the <code>LANGUAGE</code> environment variable at exactly the same time.</p>
<p>The value <code>0x220</code> looks suspiciously close to the size of the old environment
                in 64-bit words <code>(0x220 / 8 = 68)</code>, and this value was written over the
                terminating <code>NULL</code> of the environment block before it was moved, likely to
                indicate the size of the free block to the system malloc but convenienty
                providing an improper invalid pointer landmine for use-after-free victims
                to hit.</p>
<p>Given all these preconditions, we were pretty lucky that it was even mostly
                reproducible on a single platform.</p>
</div>
<div data-section-id="the-fix" id="the-fix">

<p>In the end, we decided that we’re going to migrate away from <code>reqwest</code>’s
                <code>rust-native-tls</code>/<code>openssl</code> backend to <code>rustls</code> on Linux. Our original
                thinking behind using the native TLS backend was that we’d get to avoid
                shipping two TLS engines as we continue to port Python code to Rust.
                With this issue popping up, we decided that shipping two engines would be OK
                in the short term.</p>
<p>Another option would have been to arrange to call <code>try_init_ssl_cert_env_vars</code>
                for the first time with Python’s Global Interpreter Lock (the dreaded GIL) held.
                Rust has an internal lock to prevent races between Rust code reading and writing
                the environment at the same time, but it doesn’t prevent code in other languages
                from using <code>libc</code> directly. Holding the GIL would prevent us from racing with
                our Python threads, at least.</p>
<p>The Rust project has already identified this as an issue, and has planned
                on making the environment-setter functions unsafe in the 2024 edition
                <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/124866">[17]</a>. The glibc project has also
                (very) recently added more thread-safety to <code>getenv</code>, by avoiding the
                <code>realloc</code> and leaking the older environments <a href="https://github.com/bminor/glibc/commit/7a61e7f557a97ab597d6fca5e2d1f13f65685c61">[18]</a>.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/01/mastercard-dns-error-went-unnoticed-for-years/">https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/01/mastercard-dns-error-went-unnoticed-for-years/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42793783">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
												<p>The payment card giant <strong>MasterCard</strong> just fixed a glaring error in its domain name server settings that could have allowed anyone to intercept or divert Internet traffic for the company by registering an unused domain name. The misconfiguration persisted for nearly five years until a security researcher spent $300 to register the domain and prevent it from being grabbed by cybercriminals.</p>
<div id="attachment_70128"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-70128" decoding="async" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/akamne.png" alt="" width="667" height="478"></p><p id="caption-attachment-70128">A DNS lookup on the domain az.mastercard.com on Jan. 14, 2025 shows the mistyped domain name a22-65.akam.ne.</p></div>
<p>From June 30, 2020 until January 14, 2025, one of the core Internet servers that MasterCard uses to direct traffic for portions of the mastercard.com network was misnamed. MasterCard.com relies on five shared Domain Name System (DNS) servers at the Internet infrastructure provider <strong>Akamai </strong>[DNS acts as a kind of Internet phone book, by translating website names to numeric Internet addresses that are easier for computers to manage].</p>
<p>All of the Akamai DNS server names that MasterCard uses are supposed to end in “akam.net” but one of them was misconfigured to rely on the domain “<strong>akam.ne</strong>.”</p>
<p>This tiny but potentially critical typo was discovered recently by <strong>Philippe Caturegli</strong>,&nbsp;founder of the security consultancy <a href="https://www.seralys.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seralys</a>. Caturegli said he guessed that nobody had yet registered the domain akam.ne, which is under the purview of the top-level domain authority for the West Africa nation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niger" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Niger</a>.</p>
<p>Caturegli said it took $300 and nearly three months of waiting to secure the domain with the registry in Niger. After enabling a DNS server on akam.ne, he noticed hundreds of thousands of DNS requests hitting his server each day from locations around the globe. Apparently, MasterCard wasn’t the only organization that had fat-fingered a DNS entry to include “akam.ne,” but they were by far the largest.</p>
<p>Had he enabled an email server on his new domain akam.ne, Caturegli likely would have received wayward emails directed toward mastercard.com or other affected domains. If he’d abused his access, he probably could have <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/08/local-networks-go-global-when-domain-names-collide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">obtained website encryption certificates (SSL/TLS certs)</a> that were authorized to accept and relay web traffic for affected websites. He may even have been able to <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/02/dangerous-domain-corp-com-goes-up-for-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passively receive Microsoft Windows authentication credentials</a> from employee computers at affected companies.</p>
<p>But the researcher said he didn’t attempt to do any of that. Instead, he alerted MasterCard that the domain was theirs if they wanted it, copying this author on his notifications. A few hours later, MasterCard acknowledged the mistake, but said there was never any real threat to the security of its operations.</p>
<p>“We have looked into the matter and there was not a risk to our systems,” a MasterCard spokesperson wrote. “This typo has now been corrected.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Caturegli received a request submitted through <strong>Bugcrowd</strong>, a program that offers financial rewards and recognition to security researchers who find flaws and work privately with the affected vendor to fix them. The message suggested his public disclosure of the MasterCard DNS error via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7285038365236682753/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a post on LinkedIn</a> (after he’d secured the akam.ne domain) was not aligned with ethical security practices, and passed on a request from MasterCard to have the post removed.</p>
<div id="attachment_70126"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-70126" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/mastercard-response.png" alt="" width="708" height="855"></p><p id="caption-attachment-70126">MasterCard’s request to Caturegli, a.k.a. “Titon” on infosec.exchange.</p></div>
<p>Caturegli said while he does have an account on Bugcrowd, he has never submitted anything through the Bugcrowd program, and that he reported this issue directly to MasterCard.</p>
<p>“I did not disclose this issue through Bugcrowd,” Caturegli wrote in reply. “Before making any public disclosure, I ensured that the affected domain was registered to prevent exploitation, mitigating any risk to MasterCard or its customers. This action, which we took at our own expense, demonstrates our commitment to ethical security practices and responsible disclosure.” <span id="more-70117"></span></p>
<p>Most organizations have at least two authoritative domain name servers, but some handle so many DNS requests that they need to spread the load over additional DNS server domains. In MasterCard’s case, that number is five, so it stands to reason that if an attacker managed to seize control over just one of those domains they would only be able to see about one-fifth of the overall DNS requests coming in.</p>
<p>But Caturegli said the reality is that many Internet users are relying at least to some degree on public traffic forwarders or DNS resolvers like <strong>Cloudflare</strong> and <strong>Google</strong>.</p>
<p>“So all we need is for one of these resolvers to query our name server and cache the result,” Caturegli said. By setting their DNS server records with a long TTL or “Time To Live” — a setting that can adjust the lifespan of data packets on a network — an attacker’s poisoned instructions for the target domain can be propagated by large cloud providers.</p>
<p>“With a long TTL, we may reroute a LOT more than just 1/5 of the traffic,” he said.</p>
<p>The researcher said he’d hoped that the credit card giant might thank him, or at least offer to cover the cost of buying the domain.</p>
<p>“We obviously disagree with this assessment,” Caturegli wrote in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7285038365236682753?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7285038365236682753%2C7285289297706909697%29&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287285289297706909697%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7285038365236682753%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a follow-up post</a> on LinkedIn regarding MasterCard’s public statement. “But we’ll let you judge— here are some of the DNS lookups we recorded before reporting the issue.”</p>
<div id="attachment_70125"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-70125" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/mastercard-domains.png" alt="" width="790" height="561" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/mastercard-domains.png 790w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/mastercard-domains-768x545.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/mastercard-domains-782x555.png 782w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/mastercard-domains-100x70.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 790px) 100vw, 790px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-70125">Caturegli posted this screenshot of MasterCard domains that were potentially at risk from the misconfigured domain.</p></div>
<p>As the screenshot above shows, the misconfigured DNS server Caturegli found involved the MasterCard subdomain <strong>az.mastercard.com</strong>. It is not clear exactly how this subdomain is used by MasterCard, however their naming conventions suggest the domains correspond to production servers at Microsoft’s <strong>Azure</strong> cloud service. Caturegli said the domains all resolve to Internet addresses at Microsoft.</p>
<p>“Don’t be like Mastercard,” Caturegli concluded in his LinkedIn post. “Don’t dismiss risk, and don’t let your marketing team handle security disclosures.”</p>
<p>One final note: The domain akam.ne has been registered previously — in December 2016 by someone using the email address um-i-delo@yandex.ru. The Russian search giant Yandex reports this user account belongs to an “Ivan I.” from Moscow. Passive DNS records from <a href="https://www.domaintools.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DomainTools.com</a> show that between 2016 and 2018 the domain was connected to an Internet server in Germany, and that the domain was left to expire in 2018.</p>

<p>Welcome to the world of tomorrow (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiwA0JrGfjA">Link</a>), the past and the present of computer architectures, with a small sprinkling of flashing LEDs. All good computers have to have banks of flashing lights. This web site was inspired by an article by Alan Clements (<a href="http://alanclements.org/teachingarchitecture.html">Link</a>), in this he discusses the pressures faced in teaching computer architectures. After teaching this topic for about 20 years i also came to the same conclusions, although being an electronic engineer i still embrace the power of ICs, wires and LEDs as teaching tools :). Therefore, to hopefully support computer architectures teaching i have created the resources below.</p>

<p>For those who have not taught computer architectures before this may seem an outdated, or redundant topic i.e. why do students need to know what happens inside a CPU, very few students will go on design one? To me this way of thinking highlights the misunderstanding of the purpose of teaching computer architectures. To steal a quote from Alan:</p>

<p><i>"Computer architecture is awash with concepts that are fundamental to computer science generally and which do not appear in other parts of the undergraduate curriculum. A course in computer architecture can provide a suitable forum for incorporating fundamental principles in the CS curriculum." </i></p>

<p>Computer architectures for me was never really about hardware design (although its the bit i enjoy the most), its about understanding the complete system, software and hardware. How the software we write is translated into results we can use. I'm a great believer in that you don't truly understand something until you can build it yourself and use it to solve a real world problem. To often i find students that are taught computer science at A-level know the words, but have not had the opportunity of apply this knowledge, therefore, have not had the chance to make those all important final steps to upstanding what the words really mean. Therefore, i designed the SimpleCPU architecture. Over a series of labs students design and implement this architecture using Xilinx's ISE schematic tools, so that you see the wires, not HDL :), configure FPGA boards and program these systems using assembler and macros to solve image processing problems e.g. find Bob the Bug, shown below.</p>

<p><a href="http://simplecpudesign.com/Images/bob.jpg"><img src="http://simplecpudesign.com/Images/bob_tmb.jpg"></a></p>

<p>Figure 2 : Bob</p>

<p>To me this is how computer architectures should be taught, a journey from being to end, no hidden details, just simple fundamental computer science, that hopefully everyone can understand. To conclude, i'm not saying that every student has to be able to understand Intels latest and greatest beasts (architectures) to use them, but if you don't have a basic understanding of how data is represented, or how instructions are processed, very strange things can happen when you try to run your code. At best it may just take a little longer to execute, at worst it can take down the whole machine.</p>

<h2>A Simple CPU</h2>

<p>Below are a series of blog type discussions on the development of the SimpleCPU processor, their aim is to give an insight into the design decisions made when implementing these machines. To often when discussing computer architectures we use adjectives such as complex, simple e.g. CISC (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_instruction_set_computer">Link</a>) and RISC (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer">Link</a>). I've grownup with this machine evolution, programmed them and designed a few, so i can place these words into a software and hardware context. For people new to this topic these are just words. What is simple? What is complex? How do you measure/compare these design philosophies? To me this disconnect is a problem. Therefore, being an engineer the only valid solution to teach people these ideas is: build it. In the past building your own processor was a little on the tricky side, but with the advent of programmable logic devices it now a possibility. I hope the source files and discussions below will be the starting point for people wanting to design their own processors and machine languages. These are not intended to be a complete set of notes on computer architectures, rather an introduction to this topic through the implementation of this processor in either SPLD or FPGA devices. A starting point, a foot on the road to CPU design, hopefully highlighting questions about computer architectures people have not considered before. Have fun and don't under estimate he power of the flashing LED, there is nothing more satisfying than convincing a processor to do what you tell it to :).</p>

<h2>Networking</h2>

<p>In addition to teaching an introductory module on basic computer architectures i now also teach an introductory module on basic networking, starting to forgot what my specialism is :). As always the only way to understand anything is to build it, get hand on experience of "real" networks, well as real as i can make them given security considerations. This module is designed around a collection of different Raspberry Pi based systems, giving students the opportunity to get hands on experience of designing and building actual networks, and the real world joys that come with networking :). Confess, when i think about networking i'm always reminded of an old  nursery rhyme, to paraphrase: when it is good, its very, very good, but when it is bad it is horrid. Tracking down network faults are an adventure into the world of "but it should work", a multidimensional puzzle, but very rewarding when the pieces fall into place and it just works. Below are a series of blog type discussions on the development of this hardware, as with the SimpleCPU their aim is give an insight into the design decisions made when implementing these machines. Supporting these web pages are a series of related videos on my Youtube channel, links below.</p>

            <pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 15:05:34 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/01/21/1110260/openai-ups-its-lobbying-efforts-nearly-seven-fold/">https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/01/21/1110260/openai-ups-its-lobbying-efforts-nearly-seven-fold/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42793567">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div> <p>OpenAI spent $1.76 million on government lobbying in 2024 and $510,000 in the last three months of the year alone, according to a new disclosure filed on January 22—a significant jump from 2023, when the company spent just $260,000 on Capitol Hill. </p>  <p>The company also disclosed a new in-house lobbyist, Meghan Dorn, who worked for five years for Senator Lindsey Graham and started at OpenAI in October. The filing also shows activity related to two new pieces of legislation in the final months of the year: the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/9497/text">House’s</a> AI Advancement and Reliability Act, which would set up a government center for AI research, and the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/4178/text">Senate’s</a> Future of Artificial Intelligence Innovation Act, which would create shared benchmark tests for AI models.&nbsp;</p> </div><div> <p>OpenAI did not respond to questions about its lobbying efforts.</p>  <p>But perhaps more important, the disclosure is a clear signal of the company’s arrival as a political player, as its first year of serious lobbying ends and Republican control of Washington begins. While OpenAI’s lobbying spending is still dwarfed by its peers’—Meta tops the list of Big Tech spenders, with more than $24 million in 2024—the uptick comes as it and other AI companies have helped redraw the shape of AI policy.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>For the past few years, AI policy has been something like a whack-a-mole response to the risks posed by deepfakes and misinformation. But over the last year, AI companies have started to position the success of the technology as pivotal to national security and American competitiveness, arguing that the government must therefore support the industry’s growth. As a result, OpenAI and others now seem poised to gain access to cheaper energy, lucrative national security contracts, and a more lax regulatory environment that’s unconcerned with the minutiae of AI safety.</p>  <p>While the big players seem more or less aligned on this grand narrative, messy divides on other issues are still threatening to break through the harmony on display at President Trump’s inauguration this week.</p> 
 <p>AI regulation really began in earnest after ChatGPT launched in November 2022. At that point, “a lot of the conversation was about responsibility,” says Liana Keesing, campaigns manager for technology reform at Issue One, a democracy nonprofit that tracks Big Tech’s influence.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Companies were asked what they’d do about sexually abusive <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/12/13/1064810/how-it-feels-to-be-sexually-objectified-by-an-ai/">deepfake images</a> and <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/05/15/1073019/catching-bad-content-in-the-age-of-ai/">election disinformation</a>. “Sam Altman did a very good job coming in and painting himself early as a supporter of that process,” Keesing says.&nbsp;</p>  <p>OpenAI started its official lobbying effort around October 2023, hiring Chan Park—a onetime Senate Judiciary Committee counsel and Microsoft lobbyist—to lead the effort. Lawmakers, particularly then Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer, were vocal about wanting to curb these particular harms; OpenAI hired Schumer’s former legal counsel, Reginald Babin, as a lobbyist, according to data from OpenSecrets. This past summer, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/30/technology/openai-chris-lehane.html">the company hired the veteran political operative Chris Lehane</a> as its head of global policy.&nbsp;</p>  <p>OpenAI’s previous disclosures confirm that the company’s lobbyists subsequently focused much of last year on legislation like the No Fakes Act and the Protect Elections from Deceptive AI Act. The bills did not materialize into law. But as the year went on, the regulatory goals of AI companies began to change. “One of the biggest shifts that we’ve seen,” Keesing says, “is that they’ve really started to focus on energy.”&nbsp;</p> </div><div> <p>In September, Altman, along with leaders from Nvidia, Anthropic, and Google, visited the White House and pitched the vision that US competitiveness in AI will depend on subsidized energy infrastructure to train the best models. Altman proposed to the Biden administration the construction of multiple five-gigawatt data centers, which would each consume as much electricity as New York City.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Around the same time, companies like Meta and Microsoft started to say that nuclear energy will provide the path forward for AI, announcing deals aimed at <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/01/16/1110016/new-nuclear-power/">firing up new nuclear power plants</a>.&nbsp;</p>  <p>It seems likely OpenAI’s policy team was already planning for this particular shift. In April, the company hired lobbyist Matthew Rimkunas, who worked for Bill Gates’s sustainable energy effort Breakthrough Energies and, before that, spent 16 years working for Senator Graham; the South Carolina Republican serves on the Senate subcommittee that manages nuclear safety.&nbsp;</p> </div><div> <p>This new AI energy race is inseparable from the positioning of AI as essential for national security and <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/01/21/1110269/there-can-be-no-winners-in-a-us-china-ai-arms-race/">US competitiveness</a> with China. OpenAI laid out its position in a blog post in October, writing, “AI is a transformational technology that can be used to strengthen democratic values or to undermine them. That’s why we believe democracies should continue to take the lead in AI development.” Then in December, the company went a step further and reversed its policy against working with the military, <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/12/04/1107897/openais-new-defense-contract-completes-its-military-pivot/">announcing</a> it would develop AI models with the defense-tech company Anduril to help take down drones around military bases.&nbsp;</p> 

 <p>That same month, Sam Altman said during an <a href="https://www.thefp.com/p/sam-altman-openai-feud-with-elon">interview</a> with<em> The Free Press</em> that the Biden administration was “not that effective” in shepherding AI: “The things that I think should have been the administration’s priorities, and I hope will be the next administration’s priorities, are building out massive AI infrastructure in the US, having a supply chain in the US, things like that.”</p>  <p>That characterization glosses over the CHIPS Act, a $52 billion stimulus to the domestic chips industry that is, at least on paper, aligned with Altman’s vision. (It also preceded an executive order Biden issued just last week, to lease federal land to host the type of gigawatt-scale data centers that Altman had been asking for.)</p>  <p>Intentionally or not, Altman’s posture aligned him with the growing camaraderie between President Trump and Silicon Valley. Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Sundar Pichai all sat directly behind Trump’s family at the inauguration on Monday, and Altman also attended. Many of them had also made sizable donations to Trump’s inaugural fund, with Altman personally <a href="https://apnews.com/article/sam-altman-donald-trump-openai-3b7a87037f3718eb3edc73e94be8a61a">throwing</a> in $1 million.</p>  <p>It’s easy to view the inauguration as evidence that these tech leaders are aligned with each other, and with other players in Trump’s orbit. But there are still some key dividing lines that will be worth watching. Notably, there’s the clash over H-1B visas, which allow many noncitizen AI researchers to work in the US. Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy (who is, as of this week, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/01/20/doge-musk-helped-eject-ramaswamy-00199487">no longer</a> a part of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency) have been pushing for that visa program to be expanded. This sparked backlash from some allies of the Trump administration, perhaps most loudly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/10/h-1b-visas-bannon-sanders-musk-trump">Steve Bannon</a>.&nbsp;</p> </div><div><p>Another fault line is the battle between open- and closed-source AI. Google and OpenAI prevent anyone from knowing exactly what’s in their most powerful models, often arguing that this keeps them from being used improperly by bad actors. Musk has sued OpenAI and Microsoft over the issue, alleging that closed-source models are antithetical to OpenAI’s hybrid nonprofit structure. Meta, whose Llama <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/07/18/1076479/metas-latest-ai-model-is-free-for-all/">model</a> is open-source, recently <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/elon-musk-open-ai-lawsuit-response-c1f415f8">sided</a> with Musk in that lawsuit. Venture capitalist and Trump ally Marc Andreessen echoed these criticisms of OpenAI on <a href="https://x.com/pmarca/status/1881614440174678339">X</a> just hours after the inauguration. (Andreessen has also <a href="https://www.schumer.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Marc%20Andreessen.pdf">said</a> that making AI models open-source “makes overbearing regulations unnecessary.”)&nbsp;</p>  <p>Finally, there are the battles over bias and free speech. The vastly different approaches that social media companies have taken to moderating content—including Meta’s recent <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/01/13/1109954/mark-zuckerberg-and-the-power-of-the-media/">announcement</a> that it would end its US fact-checking program—raise questions about whether the way AI models are moderated will continue to splinter too. Musk has lamented what he calls the “wokeness” of many leading models, and Andreessen said on Tuesday that “Chinese LLMs are much less censored than American LLMs” (though that’s not quite true, given that many Chinese AI models have government-mandated <a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/leonardlin/chinese-llm-censorship-analysis">censorship</a> in place that forbids particular topics). Altman has been more equivocal: “No two people are ever going to agree that one system is perfectly unbiased,” he told <em>The Free Press.</em></p>  <p>It’s only the start of a new era in Washington, but the White House has been busy. It has repealed many executive orders signed by President Biden, including the <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/10/30/1082678/three-things-to-know-about-the-white-houses-executive-order-on-ai/">landmark order on AI</a> that imposed rules for government use of the technology (while it appears to have kept Biden’s order on leasing land for more data centers). Altman is busy as well. OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-announces-private-sector-ai-infrastructure-investment/">reportedly</a> plan to spend up to $500 billion on a joint venture for new data centers; the project was announced by President Trump, with Altman standing alongside. And according to <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/01/19/ai-superagent-openai-meta"><em>Axios</em></a>, Altman will also be part of a closed-door briefing with government officials on January 30, reportedly about OpenAI’s development of a powerful new AI agent. </p></div></div></div>]]></description>

      <div><p><span size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The
          earliest version of this article was given as a talk at a conference
          called by the Southern Female Rights Union, held in Beulah, Mississippi
          in May 1970. It was written up for <u>Notes from the Third Year</u> (1971),
          but the editors did not use it. It was then submitted to several movement
          publications, but only one asked permission to publish it; others did
          so without permission. The first official place of publication was
          in Vol. 2, No. 1 of <u>The Second Wave</u> (1972). This early version
          in movement publications was authored by Joreen. Different versions
          were published in the <u>Berkeley Journal of Sociology</u>, Vol. 17,
          1972-73, pp. 151-165, and <u>Ms.</u> magazine, July 1973, pp. 76-78,
          86-89, authored by Jo Freeman. This piece spread all over the world.
          Numerous people have edited, reprinted, cut, and translated "Tyranny" for
          magazines, books and web sites, usually without the permission or knowledge
          of the author. The version below is a blend of the three cited here. </span></p></div>
      <p><span size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">During 
        the years in which the women's liberation movement has been taking shape, 
        a great emphasis has been placed on what are called leaderless, structureless 
        groups as the main -- if not sole -- organizational form of the movement. 
        The source of this idea was a natural reaction against the over-structured 
        society in which most of us found ourselves, and the inevitable control 
        this gave others over our lives, and the continual elitism of the Left 
        and similar groups among those who were supposedly fighting this overstructuredness.<br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">The 
        idea of "structurelessness," however, has moved from a healthy 
        counter to those tendencies to becoming a goddess in its own right. The 
        idea is as little examined as the term is much used, but it has become 
        an intrinsic and unquestioned part of women's liberation ideology. For 
        the early development of the movement this did not much matter. It early 
        defined its main goal, and its main method, as consciousness-raising, 
        and the "structureless" rap group was an excellent means to 
        this end. The looseness and informality of it encouraged participation 
        in discussion, and its often supportive atmosphere elicited personal insight. 
        If nothing more concrete than personal insight ever resulted from these 
        groups, that did not much matter, because their purpose did not really 
        extend beyond this.<br>

          basic problems didn't appear until individual rap groups exhausted
          the virtues of consciousness-raising and decided they wanted to do
          something more specific. At this point they usually foundered because
          most groups were unwilling to change their structure when they changed
          their tasks. Women had thoroughly accepted the idea of "structurelessness" without
          realizing the limitations of its uses. People would try to use the "structureless" group
          and the informal conference for purposes for which they were unsuitable
          out of a blind belief that no other means could possibly be anything
          but oppressive.<br>
          <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">If
          the movement is to grow beyond these elementary stages of development,
          it will have to disabuse itself of some of its prejudices about organization
          and structure. There is nothing inherently bad about either of these.
          They can be and often are misused, but to reject them out of hand because
          they are misused is to deny ourselves the necessary tools to further
          development. We need to understand why "structurelessness" does
      not work.</span></p>
      <p><span size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">FORMAL 
        AND INFORMAL STRUCTURES</span></p>
      <p><span size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">Contrary 
        to what we would like to believe, there is no such thing as a structureless 
        group. Any group of people of whatever nature that comes together for 
        any length of time for any purpose will inevitably structure itself in 
        some fashion. The structure may be flexible; it may vary over time; it 
        may evenly or unevenly distribute tasks, power and resources over the 
        members of the group. But it will be formed regardless of the abilities, 
        personalities, or intentions of the people involved. The very fact that 
        we are individuals, with different talents, predispositions, and backgrounds 
        makes this inevitable. Only if we refused to relate or interact on any 
        basis whatsoever could we approximate structurelessness -- and that is 
        not the nature of a human group.<br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">This 
        means that to strive for a structureless group is as useful, and as deceptive, 
        as to aim at an "objective" news story, "value-free" 
        social science, or a "free" economy. A "laissez faire" 
        group is about as realistic as a "laissez faire" society; the 
        idea becomes a smokescreen for the strong or the lucky to establish unquestioned 
        hegemony over others. This hegemony can be so easily established because 
        the idea of "structurelessness" does not prevent the formation 
        of informal structures, only formal ones. Similarly "laissez faire" 
        philosophy did not prevent the economically powerful from establishing 
        control over wages, prices, and distribution of goods; it only prevented 
        the government from doing so. Thus structurelessness becomes a way of 
        masking power, and within the women's movement is usually most strongly 
        advocated by those who are the most powerful (whether they are conscious 
        of their power or not). As long as the structure of the group is informal, 
        the rules of how decisions are made are known only to a few and awareness 
        of power is limited to those who know the rules. Those who do not know 
        the rules and are not chosen for initiation must remain in confusion, 
        or suffer from paranoid delusions that something is happening of which 
        they are not quite aware.<br>

          everyone to have the opportunity to be involved in a given group and
          to participate in its activities the structure must be explicit, not
          implicit. The rules of decision-making must be open and available to
          everyone, and this can happen only if they are formalized. This is
          not to say that formalization of a structure of a group will destroy
          the informal structure. It usually doesn't. But it does hinder the
          informal structure from having predominant control and make available
          some means of attacking it if the people involved are not at least
          responsible to the needs of the group at large. "Structurelessness" is
          organizationally impossible. We cannot decide whether to have a structured
          or structureless group, only whether or not to have a formally structured
          one. Therefore the word will not be used any longer except to refer
          to the idea it represents. Unstructured will refer to those groups
          which have not been deliberately structured in a particular manner.
          Structured will refer to those which have. A Structured group always
          has formal structure, and may also have an informal, or covert, structure.
          It is this informal structure, particularly in Unstructured groups,
          which forms the basis for elites.</span></p>
      <p><span size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE 
        NATURE OF ELITISM</span></p>
      <p><span size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">"Elitist" 
        is probably the most abused word in the women's liberation movement. It 
        is used as frequently, and for the same reasons, as "pinko" 
        was used in the fifties. It is rarely used correctly. Within the movement 
        it commonly refers to individuals, though the personal characteristics 
        and activities of those to whom it is directed may differ widely: An individual, 
        as an individual can never be an elitist, because the only proper application 
        of the term "elite" is to groups. Any individual, regardless 
        of how well-known that person may be, can never be an elite.<br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">Correctly, 
        an elite refers to a small group of people who have power over a larger 
        group of which they are part, usually without direct responsibility to 
        that larger group, and often without their knowledge or consent. A person 
        becomes an elitist by being part of, or advocating the rule by, such a 
        small group, whether or not that individual is well known or not known 
        at all. Notoriety is not a definition of an elitist. The most insidious 
        elites are usually run by people not known to the larger public at all. 
        Intelligent elitists are usually smart enough not to allow themselves 
        to become well known; when they become known, they are watched, and the 
        mask over their power is no longer firmly lodged.<br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">Elites 
        are not conspiracies. Very seldom does a small group of people get together 
        and deliberately try to take over a larger group for its own ends. Elites 
        are nothing more, and nothing less, than groups of friends who also happen 
        to participate in the same political activities. They would probably maintain 
        their friendship whether or not they were involved in political activities; 
        they would probably be involved in political activities whether or not 
        they maintained their friendships. It is the coincidence of these two 
        phenomena which creates elites in any group and makes them so difficult 
        to break.<br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">These 
        friendship groups function as networks of communication outside any regular 
        channels for such communication that may have been set up by a group. 
        If no channels are set up, they function as the only networks of communication. 
        Because people are friends, because they usually share the same values 
        and orientations, because they talk to each other socially and consult 
        with each other when common decisions have to be made, the people involved 
        in these networks have more power in the group than those who don't. And 
        it is a rare group that does not establish some informal networks of communication 
        through the friends that are made in it.<br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">Some 
        groups, depending on their size, may have more than one such informal 
        communications network. Networks may even overlap. When only one such 
        network exists, it is the elite of an otherwise Unstructured group, whether 
        the participants in it want to be elitists or not. If it is the only such 
        network in a Structured group it may or may not be an elite depending 
        on its composition and the nature of the formal Structure. If there are 
        two or more such networks of friends, they may compete for power within 
        the group, thus forming factions, or one may deliberately opt out of the 
        competition, leaving the other as the elite. In a Structured group, two 
        or more such friendship networks usually compete with each other for formal 
        power. This is often the healthiest situation, as the other members are 
        in a position to arbitrate between the two competitors for power and thus 
        to make demands on those to whom they give their temporary allegiance.<br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">The 
        inevitably elitist and exclusive nature of informal communication networks 
        of friends is neither a new phenomenon characteristic of the women's movement 
        nor a phenomenon new to women. Such informal relationships have excluded 
        women for centuries from participating in integrated groups of which they 
        were a part. In any profession or organization these networks have created 
        the "locker room" mentality and the "old school" ties 
        which have effectively prevented women as a group (as well as some men 
        individually) from having equal access to the sources of power or social 
        reward. Much of the energy of past women's movements has been directed 
        to having the structures of decision-making and the selection processes 
        formalized so that the exclusion of women could be confronted directly. 
        As we well know, these efforts have not prevented the informal male-only 
        networks from discriminating against women, but they have made it more 
        difficult.<br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">Because 
        elites are informal does not mean they are invisible. At any small group 
        meeting anyone with a sharp eye and an acute ear can tell who is influencing 
        whom. The members of a friendship group will relate more to each other 
        than to other people. They listen more attentively, and interrupt less; 
        they repeat each other's points and give in amiably; they tend to ignore 
        or grapple with the "outs" whose approval is not necessary for 
        making a decision. But it is necessary for the "outs" to stay 
        on good terms with the "ins." Of course the lines are not as 
        sharp as I have drawn them. They are nuances of interaction, not prewritten 
        scripts. But they are discernible, and they do have their effect. Once 
        one knows with whom it is important to check before a decision is made, 
        and whose approval is the stamp of acceptance, one knows who is running 
        things.<br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">Since 
        movement groups have made no concrete decisions about who shall exercise 
        power within them, many different criteria are used around the country. 
        Most criteria are along the lines of traditional female characteristics. 
        For instance, in the early days of the movement, marriage was usually 
        a prerequisite for participation in the informal elite. As women have 
        been traditionally taught, married women relate primarily to each other, 
        and look upon single women as too threatening to have as close friends. 
        In many cities, this criterion was further refined to include only those 
        women married to New Left men. This standard had more than tradition behind 
        it, however, because New Left men often had access to resources needed 
        by the movement -- such as mailing lists, printing presses, contacts, 
        and information -- and women were used to getting what they needed through 
        men rather than independently. As the movement has charged through time, 
        marriage has become a less universal criterion for effective participation, 
        but all informal elites establish standards by which only women who possess 
        certain material or personal characteristics may join. They frequently 
        include: middle-class background (despite all the rhetoric about relating 
        to the working class); being married; not being married but living with 
        someone; being or pretending to be a lesbian; being between the ages of 
        twenty and thirty; being college educated or at least having some college 
        background; being "hip"; not being too "hip"; holding 
        a certain political line or identification as a "radical"; having 
        children or at least liking them; not having children; having certain 
        "feminine" personality characteristics such as being "nice"; 
        dressing right (whether in the traditional style or the antitraditional 
        style); etc. There are also some characteristics which will almost always 
        tag one as a "deviant" who should not be related to. They include: 
        being too old; working full time, particularly if one is actively committed 
        to a "career"; not being "nice"; and being avowedly 
        single (i.e., neither actively heterosexual nor homosexual).<br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">Other 
        criteria could be included, but they all have common themes. The characteristics 
        prerequisite for participating in the informal elites of the movement, 
        and thus for exercising power, concern one's background, personality, 
        or allocation of time. They do not include one's competence, dedication 
        to feminism, talents, or potential contribution to the movement. The former 
        are the criteria one usually uses in determining one's friends. The latter 
        are what any movement or organization has to use if it is going to be 
        politically effective.<br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">The 
        criteria of participation may differ from group to group, but the means 
        of becoming a member of the informal elite if one meets those criteria 
        art pretty much the same. The only main difference depends on whether 
        one is in a group from the beginning, or joins it after it has begun. 
        If involved from the beginning it is important to have as many of one's 
        personal friends as possible also join. If no one knows anyone else very 
        well, then one must deliberately form friendships with a select number 
        and establish the informal interaction patterns crucial to the creation 
        of an informal structure. Once the informal patterns are formed they act 
        to maintain themselves, and one of the most successful tactics of maintenance 
        is to continuously recruit new people who "fit in." One joins 
        such an elite much the same way one pledges a sorority. If perceived as 
        a potential addition, one is "rushed" by the members of the 
        informal structure and eventually either dropped or initiated. If the 
        sorority is not politically aware enough to actively engage in this process 
        itself it can be started by the outsider pretty much the same way one 
        joins any private club. Find a sponsor, i.e., pick some member of the 
        elite who appears to be well respected within it, and actively cultivate 
        that person's friendship. Eventually, she will most likely bring you into 
        the inner circle.<br>

          of these procedures take time. So if one works full time or has a similar
          major commitment, it is usually impossible to join simply because there
          are not enough hours left to go to all the meetings and cultivate the
          personal relationship necessary to have a voice in the decision-making.
          That is why formal structures of decision making are a boon to the
          overworked person. Having an established process for decision-making
          ensures that everyone can participate in it to some extent.<br>
          <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">Although
          this dissection of the process of elite formation within small groups
          has been critical in perspective, it is not made in the belief that
          these informal structures are inevitably bad -- merely inevitable.
          All groups create informal structures as a result of interaction patterns
          among the members of the group. Such informal structures can do very
          useful things But only Unstructured groups are totally governed by
          them. When informal elites are combined with a myth of "structurelessness," there
          can be no attempt to put limits on the use of power. It becomes capricious.<br>
          <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">This
          has two potentially negative consequences of which we should be aware.
          The first is that the informal structure of decision-making will be
          much like a sorority -- one in which people listen to others because
          they like them and not because they say significant things. As long
          as the movement does not do significant things this does not much matter.
          But if its development is not to be arrested at this preliminary stage,
          it will have to alter this trend. The second is that informal structures
          have no obligation to be responsible to the group at large. Their power
          was not given to them; it cannot be taken away. Their influence is
          not based on what they do for the group; therefore they cannot be directly
          influenced by the group. This does not necessarily make informal structures
          irresponsible. Those who are concerned with maintaining their influence
          will usually try to be responsible. The group simply cannot compel
      such responsibility; it is dependent on the interests of the elite.</span></p>

        THE "STAR" SYSTEM</span></p>
      <p><span size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">The 
        idea of "structurelessness" has created the "star" 
        system. We live in a society which expects political groups to make decisions 
        and to select people to articulate those decisions to the public at large. 
        The press and the public do not know how to listen seriously to individual 
        women as women; they want to know how the group feels. Only three techniques 
        have ever been developed for establishing mass group opinion: the vote 
        or referendum, the public opinion survey questionnaire, and the selection 
        of group spokespeople at an appropriate meeting. The women's liberation 
        movement has used none of these to communicate with the public. Neither 
        the movement as a whole nor most of the multitudinous groups within it 
        have established a means of explaining their position on various issues. 
        But the public is conditioned to look for spokespeople.<br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">While 
        it has consciously not chosen spokespeople, the movement has thrown up 
        many women who have caught the public eye for varying reasons. These women 
        represent no particular group or established opinion; they know this and 
        usually say so. But because there are no official spokespeople nor any 
        decision-making body that the press can query when it wants to know the 
        movement's position on a subject, these women are perceived as the spokespeople. 
        Thus, whether they want to or not, whether the movement likes it or not, 
        women of public note are put in the role of spokespeople by default.<br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">This 
        is one main source of the ire that is often felt toward the women who 
        are labeled "stars." Because they were not selected by the women 
        in the movement to represent the movement's views, they are resented when 
        the press presumes that they speak for the movement. But as long as the 
        movement does not select its own spokeswomen, such women will be placed 
        in that role by the press and the public, regardless of their own desires.<br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">This 
        has several negative consequences for both the movement and the women 
        labeled "stars." First, because the movement didn't put them 
        in the role of spokesperson, the movement cannot remove them. The press 
        put them there and only the press can choose not to listen. The press 
        will continue to look to "stars" as spokeswomen as long as it 
        has no official alternatives to go to for authoritative statements from 
        the movement. The movement has no control in the selection of its representatives 
        to the public as long as it believes that it should have no representatives 
        at all. Second, women put in this position often find themselves viciously 
        attacked by their sisters. This achieves nothing for the movement and 
        is painfully destructive to the individuals involved. Such attacks only 
        result in either the woman leaving the movement entirely-often bitterly 
        alienated -- or in her ceasing to feel responsible to her "sisters." 
        She may maintain some loyalty to the movement, vaguely defined, but she 
        is no longer susceptible to pressures from other women in it. One cannot 
        feel responsible to people who have been the source of such pain without 
        being a masochist, and these women are usually too strong to bow to that 
        kind of personal pressure. Thus the backlash to the "star" system 
        in effect encourages the very kind of individualistic nonresponsibility 
        that the movement condemns. By purging a sister as a "star," 
        the movement loses whatever control it may have had over the person who 
        then becomes free to commit all of the individualistic sins of which she 
      has been accused.</span></p>
      <p><span size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">POLITICAL 
        IMPOTENCE</span></p>
      <p><span size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">Unstructured 
        groups may be very effective in getting women to talk about their lives; 
        they aren't very good for getting things done. It is when people get tired 
        of "just talking" and want to do something more that the groups 
        flounder, unless they change the nature of their operation. Occasionally, 
        the developed informal structure of the group coincides with an available 
        need that the group can fill in such a way as to give the appearance that 
        an Unstructured group "works." That is, the group has fortuitously 
        developed precisely the kind of structure best suited for engaging in 
        a particular project. <br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">While working in this kind of group is a very heady experience, it is also rare 
        and very hard to replicate. There are almost inevitably four conditions 
        found in such a group;<br>
      </span></p>
      <p><span size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">1)<i> 
        It is task oriented</i>. Its function is very narrow and very specific, 
        like putting on a conference or putting out a newspaper. It is the task 
        that basically structures the group. The task determines what needs to 
        be done and when it needs to be done. It provides a guide by which people 
        can judge their actions and make plans for future activity.<br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">2) 
        <i>It is relatively small and homogeneous</i>. Homogeneity is necessary 
        to insure that participants have a "common language" for interaction. 
        People from widely different backgrounds may provide richness to a consciousness-raising 
        group where each can learn from the others' experience, but too great 
        a diversity among members of a task-oriented group means only that they 
        continually misunderstand each other. Such diverse people interpret words 
        and actions differently. They have different expectations about each other's 
        behavior and judge the results according to different criteria. If everyone 
        knows everyone else well enough to understand the nuances, these can be 
        accommodated. Usually, they only lead to confusion and endless hours spent 
        straightening out conflicts no one ever thought would arise.<br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">3) 
        <i>There is a high degree of communication</i>. Information must be passed 
        on to everyone, opinions checked, work divided up, and participation assured 
        in the relevant decisions. This is only possible if the group is small 
        and people practically live together for the most crucial phases of the 
        task. Needless to say, the number of interactions necessary to involve 
        everybody increases geometrically with the number of participants. This 
        inevitably limits group participants to about five, or excludes some from 
        some of the decisions. Successful groups can be as large as 10 or 15, 
        but only when they are in fact composed of several smaller subgroups which 
        perform specific parts of the task, and whose members overlap with each 
        other so that knowledge of what the different subgroups are doing can 
        be passed around easily.<br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">4) 
        <i>There is a low degree of skill specialization</i>. Not everyone has 
        to be able to do everything, but everything must be able to be done by 
        more than one person. Thus no one is indispensable. To a certain extent, 
        people become interchangeable parts.<br>
      </span></p>
      <p><span size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">While 
        these conditions can occur serendipitously in small groups, this is not 
        possible in large ones. Consequently, because the larger movement in most 
        cities is as unstructured as individual rap groups, it is not too much 
        more effective than the separate groups at specific tasks. The informal 
        structure is rarely together enough or in touch enough with the people 
        to be able to operate effectively. So the movement generates much motion 
        and few results. Unfortunately, the consequences of all this motion are 
        not as innocuous as the results' and their victim is the movement itself.<br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">Some 
        groups have formed themselves into local action projects if they do not 
        involve many people and work on a small scale. But this form restricts 
        movement activity to the local level; it cannot be done on the regional 
        or national. Also, to function well the groups must usually pare themselves 
        down to that informal group of friends who were running things in the 
        first place. This excludes many women from participating. As long as the 
        only way women can participate in the movement is through membership in 
        a small group, the nongregarious are at a distinct disadvantage. As long 
        as friendship groups are the main means of organizational activity, elitism 
        becomes institutionalized.<br>
        <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">For 
        those groups which cannot find a local project to which to devote themselves, 
        the mere act of staying together becomes the reason for their staying 
        together. When a group has no specific task (and consciousness raising 
        is a task), the people in it turn their energies to controlling others 
        in the group. This is not done so much out of a malicious desire to manipulate 
        others (though sometimes it is) as out of a lack of anything better to 
        do with their talents. Able people with time on their hands and a need 
        to justify their coming together put their efforts into personal control, 
        and spend their time criticizing the personalities of the other members 
        in the group. Infighting and personal power games rule the day. When a 
        group is involved in a task, people learn to get along with others as 
        they are and to subsume personal dislikes for the sake of the larger goal. 
        There are limits placed on the compulsion to remold every person in our 
        image of what they should be.<br>

          end of consciousness-raising leaves people with no place to go, and
          the lack of structure leaves them with no way of getting there. The
          women the movement either turn in on themselves and their sisters or
          seek other alternatives of action. There are few that are available.
          Some women just "do their own thing." This can lead to a
          great deal of individual creativity, much of which is useful for the
          movement, but it is not a viable alternative for most women and certainly
          does not foster a spirit of cooperative group effort. Other women drift
          out of the movement entirely because they don't want to develop an
          individual project and they have found no way of discovering, joining,
          or starting group projects that interest them.<br>
          <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">Many
          turn to other political organizations to give them the kind of structured,
          effective activity that they have not been able to find in the women's
          movement. Those political organizations which see women's liberation
          as only one of many issues to which women should devote their time
          thus find the movement a vast recruiting ground for new members. There
          is no need for such organizations to "infiltrate" (though
          this is not precluded). The desire for meaningful political activity
          generated in women by their becoming part of the women's liberation
          movement is sufficient to make them eager to join other organizations
          when the movement itself provides no outlets for their new ideas and
          energies. Those women who join other political organizations while
          remaining within the women's liberation movement, or who join women's
          liberation while remaining in other political organizations, in turn
          become the framework for new informal structures. These friendship
          networks are based upon their common nonfeminist politics rather than
          the characteristics discussed earlier, but operate in much the same
          way. Because these women share common values, ideas, and political
          orientations, they too become informal, unplanned, unselected, unresponsible
          elites -- whether they intend to be so or not.<br>
          <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">These
          new informal elites are often perceived as threats by the old informal
          elites previously developed within different movement groups. This
          is a correct perception. Such politically oriented networks are rarely
          willing to be merely "sororities" as many of the old ones
          were, and want to proselytize their political as well as their feminist
          ideas. This is only natural, but its implications for women's liberation
          have never been adequately discussed. The old elites are rarely willing
          to bring such differences of opinion out into the open because it would
          involve exposing the nature of the informal structure of the group.<br>
          <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">Many
          of these informal elites have been hiding under the banner of "anti-elitism" and "structurelessness." To
          effectively counter the competition from another informal structure,
          they would have to become "public," and this possibility
          is fraught with many dangerous implications. Thus, to maintain its
          own power, it is easier to rationalize the exclusion of the members
          of the other informal structure by such means as "red-baiting," "reformist-baiting," "lesbian-baiting," or "straight-baiting." The
          only other alternative is to formally structure the group in such a
          way that the original power structure is institutionalized. This is
          not always possible. If the informal elites have been well structured
          and have exercised a fair amount of power in the past, such a task
          is feasible. These groups have a history of being somewhat politically
          effective in the past, as the tightness of the informal structure has
          proven an adequate substitute for a formal structure. Becoming Structured
          does not alter their operation much, though the institutionalization
          of the power structure does open it to formal challenge. It is those
          groups which are in greatest need of structure that are often least
          capable of creating it. Their informal structures have not been too
          well formed and adherence to the ideology of "structurelessness" makes
          them reluctant to change tactics. The more Unstructured a group is,
          the more lacking it is in informal structures, and the more it adheres
          to an ideology of "structurelessness," the more vulnerable
          it is to being taken over by a group of political comrades.<br>
          <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">Since
          the movement at large is just as Unstructured as most of its constituent
          groups, it is similarly susceptible to indirect influence. But the
          phenomenon manifests itself differently. On a local level most groups
          can operate autonomously; but the only groups that can organize a national
          activity are nationally organized groups. Thus, it is often the Structured
          feminist organizations that provide national direction for feminist
          activities, and this direction is determined by the priorities of those
          organizations. Such groups as NOW, WEAL, and some leftist women's caucuses
          are simply the only organizations capable of mounting a national campaign.
          The multitude of Unstructured women's liberation groups can choose
          to support or not support the national campaigns, but are incapable
          of mounting their own. Thus their members become the troops under the
          leadership of the Structured organizations. The avowedly Unstructured
          groups have no way of drawing upon the movement's vast resources to
          support its priorities. It doesn't even have a way of deciding what
          they are.<br>
          <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">The
          more unstructured a movement it, the less control it has over the directions
          in which it develops and the political actions in which it engages.
          This does not mean that its ideas do not spread. Given a certain amount
          of interest by the media and the appropriateness of social conditions,
          the ideas will still be diffused widely. But diffusion of ideas does
          not mean they are implemented; it only means they are talked about.
          Insofar as they can be applied individually they may be acted on; insofar
          as they require coordinated political power to be implemented, they
          will not be.<br>
          <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">As
          long as the women's liberation movement stays dedicated to a form of
          organization which stresses small, inactive discussion groups among
          friends, the worst problems of Unstructuredness will not be felt. But
          this style of organization has its limits; it is politically inefficacious,
          exclusive, and discriminatory against those women who are not or cannot
          be tied into the friendship networks. Those who do not fit into what
          already exists because of class, race, occupation, education, parental
          or marital status, personality, etc., will inevitably be discouraged
          from trying to participate. Those who do fit in will develop vested
          interests in maintaining things as they are.<br>
          <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">The
          informal groups' vested interests will be sustained by the informal
          structures which exist, and the movement will have no way of determining
          who shall exercise power within it. If the movement continues deliberately
          to not select who shall exercise power, it does not thereby abolish
          power. All it does is abdicate the right to demand that those who do
          exercise power and influence be responsible for it. If the movement
          continues to keep power as diffuse as possible because it knows it
          cannot demand responsibility from those who have it, it does prevent
          any group or person from totally dominating. But it simultaneously
          insures that the movement is as ineffective as possible. Some middle
          ground between domination and ineffectiveness can and must be found.<br>
          <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">These
          problems are coming to a head at this time because the nature of the
          movement is necessarily changing. Consciousness-raising as the main
          function of the women's liberation movement is becoming obsolete. Due
          to the intense press publicity of the last two years and the numerous
          overground books and articles now being circulated, women's liberation
          has become a household word. Its issues are discussed and informal
          rap groups are formed by people who have no explicit connection with
          any movement group. The movement must go on to other tasks. It now
          needs to establish its priorities, articulate its goals, and pursue
          its objectives in a coordinated fashion. To do this it must get organized
      -- locally, regionally, and nationally.</span></p>
      <p><span size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">PRINCIPLES 
        OF DEMOCRATIC STRUCTURING</span></p>
      <p><span size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">Once 
        the movement no longer clings tenaciously to the ideology of "structurelessness," 
        it is free to develop those forms of organization best suited to its healthy 
        functioning. This does not mean that we should go to the other extreme 
        and blindly imitate the traditional forms of organization. But neither 
        should we blindly reject them all. Some of the traditional techniques 
        will prove useful, albeit not perfect; some will give us insights into 
        what we should and should not do to obtain certain ends with minimal costs 
        to the individuals in the movement. Mostly, we will have to experiment 
        with different kinds of structuring and develop a variety of techniques 
        to use for different situations. The Lot System is one such idea which 
        has emerged from the movement. It is not applicable to all situations, 
        but is useful in some. Other ideas for structuring are needed. But before 
        we can proceed to experiment intelligently, we must accept the idea that 
        there is nothing inherently bad about structure itself -- only its excess 
        use.<br>

                  engaging in this trial-and-error process, there are some principles
                  we can keep in mind that are essential to democratic structuring
                  and are also politically effective:<br>
              </span></p>
              <p><span size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">1) 
                <u>Delegation</u> of specific authority to specific individuals 
                for specific tasks by democratic procedures. Letting people assume 
                jobs or tasks only by default means they are not dependably done. 
                If people are selected to do a task, preferably after expressing 
                an interest or willingness to do it, they have made a commitment 
                which cannot so easily be ignored.<br>
                <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">2) 
                Requiring all those to whom authority has been delegated to be 
                <u>responsible</u> to those who selected them. This is how the 
                group has control over people in positions of authority. Individuals 
                may exercise power, but it is the group that has ultimate say 
                over how the power is exercised.<br>
                <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">3) 
                <u>Distribution</u> of authority among as many people as is reasonably 
                possible. This prevents monopoly of power and requires those in 
                positions of authority to consult with many others in the process 
                of exercising it. It also gives many people the opportunity to 
                have responsibility for specific tasks and thereby to learn different 
                skills.<br>
                <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">4) 
                <u>Rotation</u> of tasks among individuals. Responsibilities which 
                are held too long by one person, formally or informally, come 
                to be seen as that person's "property" and are not easily 
                relinquished or controlled by the group. Conversely, if tasks 
                are rotated too frequently the individual does not have time to 
                learn her job well and acquire the sense of satisfaction of doing 
                a good job.<br>
                <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">5) 
                <u>Allocation</u> of tasks along rational criteria. Selecting 
                someone for a position because they are liked by the group or 
                giving them hard work because they are disliked serves neither 
                the group nor the person in the long run. Ability, interest, and 
                responsibility have got to be the major concerns in such selection. 
                People should be given an opportunity to learn skills they do 
                not have, but this is best done through some sort of "apprenticeship" 
                program rather than the "sink or swim" method. Having 
                a responsibility one can't handle well is demoralizing. Conversely, 
                being blacklisted from doing what one can do well does not encourage 
                one to develop one's skills. Women have been punished for being 
                competent throughout most of human history; the movement does 
                not need to repeat this process.<br>
                <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">6) 
                <u>Diffusion of information</u> to everyone as frequently as possible. 
                Information is power. Access to information enhances one's power. 
                When an informal network spreads new ideas and information among 
                themselves outside the group, they are already engaged in the 
                process of forming an opinion -- without the group participating. 
                The more one knows about how things work and what is happening, 
                the more politically effective one can be.<br>
                <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">7) 
                <u>Equal access to resources</u> needed by the group. This is 
                not always perfectly possible, but should be striven for. A member 
                who maintains a monopoly over a needed resource (like a printing 
                press owned by a husband, or a darkroom) can unduly influence 
                the use of that resource. Skills and information are also resources. 
                Members' skills can be equitably available only when members are 
                willing to teach what they know to others.<br>
              </span></p>
              <p><span size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                <img src="https://www.jofreeman.com/imagehome/spacer.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10">When 
                these principles are applied, they insure that whatever structures 
                are developed by different movement groups will be controlled 
                by and responsible to the group. The group of people in positions 
                of authority will be diffuse, flexible, open, and temporary. They 
                will not be in such an easy position to institutionalize their 
                power because ultimate decisions will be made by the group at 
                large. The group will have the power to determine who shall exercise 
                authority within it.</span></p>

            <guid>42791428</guid>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's been a few months since I deleted a lot of apps on my phone and instead installed many restrictive apps to control my insatiable <em>scrolling</em> addiction.</p>
<h2>Fighting the interconnected reality</h2>
<p>There are simply too many means to escapism in one's electronic devices:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Content apps: Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, etc.
</li>
<li>
Work apps: Slack, Workplace, etc
</li>
<li>
All these apps have moderate web apps, so no getaway while you have an easily accessible browser on your phone
</li>
<li>
You can easily login to these websites on your work laptop
</li>
</ul>
<p>Everything is hyper-connected and available at all times to occupy us. Wouldn't people prone to procrastination, such as myself, naturally choose to enter the rabbit hole if everything is at their fingertips? I think they would. At least, I did so.</p>
<h2>Do I need all these means of viewing content and scrolling at all times?</h2>
<p>Probably not. Let's experiment.</p>
<h3>The solution</h3>
<ul>
<li>Delete content apps
<ul>
<li>
Entertainment: YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Reddit
</li>
<li>
Information databases: GoodReads, StoryGraph, IMDB
</li>
<li>
Messaging: Gmail, Slack
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Delete the browser from the phone
<ul>
<li>
Chrome, or rather disable it, because deleting it is not an option on my Android phone
</li>
<li>
Google, a super-app on Android phones with the browsing feature
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Delete personal profile/browser from the work laptop
<ul>
<li>
I used to have "Arc" browser on my work laptop with my personal Google account profile
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Some early-stage issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Sharing a link/content from the work laptop to a personal space got more difficult. However, it's not a frequent problem.
</li>
<li>
I lost access to some services I used with my personal account. It was more convenient to do a simple task while working on my corporate laptop. Again, a problem that one can get used to.
</li>
<li>Deleting Chrome browser and Google apps caused worse problems
<ul>
<li>
I didn't even realize until then that some separate apps rely on the Google super-app. Like the weather app or some functionalities of the translation app! I lost access to these functionalities with disabling the super-app.
</li>
<li>
In some rare cases, the web app is better than the native Android app. I lost the ability to use them because I didn't have a browser anymore.
</li>
<li>
Some bank transfers need the browser page for authentication. Rarely, some other operations get blocked too without a browser.
</li>
<li>
Some quick, simple tasks don't need a whole Android app, a browser can handle them. But without a browser, those simple tasks become cumbersome.
</li>
<li>
Without the Email app, it's difficult to quickly access a ticket or receipt when you need it outdoors, away from your laptop.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Current Situation</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Deleting the personal account browser from the work laptop was successful. After a while, I got used to the minor inconveniences. More importantly, I removed some easily accessible procrastination tools from my professional workflow. No more checking personal emails, running quick online errands, or look something up.
</li>
<li>
Deleting work feeds from my phone was also successful. I realized I don't really need Slack, Gmail and Workplace apps all the time. It helped me set healthy boundaries with work. Now I only check my messages when I'm behind my desk and I'm not busy with focused, deep work.
</li>
<li>
Deleting content apps from my phone was another successful attempt. I've tried this method now and then. This time, I stuck with it once and for all.
</li>
<li>Deleting the browser apps from my phone proved more problematic, though. It impeded some daily operations with my phone.
<ul>
<li>
Some actions became impossible, as I mentioned in the previous part
</li>
<li>
To resolve that, I had to return to having browser apps on my phone, but with new restrictions.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Later modifications</h4>
<p>To resolve the complications of not having a browser on my phone, I took these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>A minimal launch UI to break my habits:
<ul>
<li>
The new UI is a simplistic black screen with no widgets or app icons
</li>
<li>This app can restrict other apps or hide an app from the view
<ul>
<li>
For example, I use this feature to enable the Google super-app, but hide it completely. So it's difficult for me to open it directly.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A more advanced website blocker and set restrictions on social media and browsing websites
<ul>
<li>
An interesting method I found in this app was to block distracting websites based on the location. I set them to be blocked at home, where I spend most of my focused time.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A new browser instead of Chrome
<ul>
<li>
Doing this helped me break some old habits I've formed over the years with a browser I'm used to. For example, the Google ecosystem knew me too well and constantly recommended articles to me to click on. A new browser without this historical data helped me to focus on the task at hand instead of getting distracted by the shiny, new, but useless information online.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Results</h2>
<p>After a few months of making the above changes and applying some adjustments, I'm seeing its effects. I still procrastinate, however, my devices can't lure me into the rabbit hole anymore. I have more control over what's available to me and I have an easier time choosing the alternatives over infinite scrolling.</p>
<p>These days when I spend time on my phone, I usually play "Spelling Bee," a game I enjoy and it has a daily "end" state unlike the infinite content apps. When I reach that point, I know that there isn't much to do with my phone. I always wanted to expand my reading time but never got to do that with the constant exposure to easy content. It's been a while that I'm able to choose to read when I'm looking for something to do besides work and chores.</p>
<p>I constantly need to find new ways to constrain my media consumption addictions, but I'm happy with my efforts. When it works, I feel saner and calmer and I do what I actually enjoy doing with my time. And if not, at least I'm doing what I need to do.</p>
