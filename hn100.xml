<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The way we consume content on the internet is increasingly driven by walled-garden platforms and black-box feed algorithms. This shift is making our media diets miserable. Ironically, a solution to the problem predates algorithmic feeds, social media and other forms of informational junk food. It is called RSS (Really Simple Syndication) and it is beautiful.</p><p>RSS is just a format that defines how websites can publish updates (articles, posts, episodes, and so on) in a standard feed that you can subscribe to using an RSS reader (or aggregator). Don’t worry if this sounds extremely uninteresting to you; there aren’t many people that get excited about format specifications; the beauty of RSS is in its simplicity. Any content management system or blog platform supports RSS out of the box, and often enables it by default. As a result, a large portion of the content on the internet is available to you in feeds that you can tap into. But this time, you’re in full control of what you’re receiving, and the feeds are purely reverse chronological bliss. Coincidentally, you might already be using RSS without even knowing, because the whole podcasting world <a href="https://www.thepodcasthost.com/business-of-podcasting/podcasts-need-an-rss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">runs on RSS</a>.</p><p>There are many amazing articles about the utility and elegance of RSS, and I do not think the world needs another, so I will spare you and instead focus on my personal experience and tips. If you are interested in a deeper dive, I highly recommend Molly White’s article <a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/curate-with-rss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Curate your own newspaper with RSS</a>. It is a convincing, well-written article that you can also listen to in Molly’s own voice if you wish to.</p><h2 id="broken-distribution-models">Broken distribution models</h2><p>Here’s a little story about the promise of social media. In 2011, my <a href="https://somnusaeternus.cz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">band</a> was getting a little more serious and preparing to record our first album. Facebook was rapidly growing all over the world, so I created an account - mostly to manage my band’s Facebook page. Back then, social media (and Facebook in particular) felt very different: vibrant and full of promise for the brave new future of web 2.0. I looked up all my favorite bands so that every time they put out an album or tour near me, I wouldn’t miss it. Many bands either lacked proper websites or rarely updated them in a useful way, so this felt like the perfect use case for Facebook.</p><p>It didn’t take long for me to start seeing the cracks. As Facebook would push for more engagement, some bands would flood their pages with multiple posts per day, especially if they were touring or had a new release coming up. Others would be more restrained, but then their posts would often be lost in the feed. There was no way to opt in only for a certain type of updates from my followed pages, and the increasingly algorithmic feed would simply prioritize posts by engagement. I realized that I wouldn’t be able to get just the <strong>important</strong> updates; instead, I’d get a wild mish-mash of engagement-bait that I wasn’t willing to work my way through. And don’t get me started about how over time, page owners had to pay to promote their posts to get any reach on the platform - that is simply extortion.</p><p>I no longer use Facebook (or any similar social media for that matter) for many reasons, though algorithmic feeds are at the top of the list. Algorithms on social media are very unlikely to be written with your best interest in mind: The goal of social media is to keep you glued to the feed for as long as possible. It optimizes for the most time spent, for engagement, for serving the most ads. It will not necessarily optimize for keeping you well informed, showing you balanced opinions, giving you control or even showing you all the information you’d like. The misalignment of incentives has become very apparent in the last few years, but the problem goes deeper. Any type of curation (because algorithmic feeds are simply curation machines) will never be flexible enough to account for every person’s needs. The story we are sold with algorithmic curation is that it adapts to everyone’s taste and interests, but that’s only true until the interests of the advertisers enter the picture.</p><p>My RSS journey starting many moons ago with Opera and Thunderbird, continued with Google Reader (RIP) and <a href="https://www.theoldreader.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Old Reader</a>, and finally led me to running my own instance of <a href="https://www.freshrss.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FreshRSS</a>. However, in the last year, I have read most of the content from my RSS feeds on my phone via the <a href="https://github.com/seazon/FeedMe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FeedMe</a> app. I find that it scratches the itch of unlocking your phone and wanting to see something novel (probably gravitating towards social media). On the upside, it feeds me only articles and media that a) I have picked upfront and nothing more, b) is typically longer-form and more thoughtful than your typical social media posts.</p><p>Also, unlike algorithmic feeds, it allows me to pick what category of my interests I am in the mood for. If I’m in the mood for something lighter, I can just look into my “Fun” folder to check out new stuff from <a href="https://theoatmeal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Oatmeal</a> or <a href="https://xkcd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">xkcd</a>. If I feel like reading something more thoughtful, I’d dive into my “Reads” folder for <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Marginalian</a> or <a href="https://sentiers.media/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sentiers</a>. Feeling like catching up on the newest AI research? I can browse the latest research papers from <a href="https://arxiv.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arXiv</a> that have specific keywords in the abstracts (such as prompt injection). Or I could just browse everything at once to see what piques my interest. I am the master of what information I consume, how and in what order, and no one can take that away from me by rearranging my feed or tweaking the algorithm.</p><p>One of the many small advantages is the consistency of the interface and the lack of distractions when reading. Modern browsers support reader modes, but you need to enter the mode manually and some pages might not be displayed correctly. I don’t have any attention problems (that I know of), but reading articles on certain newspaper sites feels like a cruel joke: the text of the article is often drowned by ads, suggested articles, polls, and other visual smog. Not a pleasant reading experience. Your RSS reader always uses the same font, font size, screen real estate and never shows anything but the article itself.</p><p>The focused, reductive nature of RSS readers means you don’t get the full website experience, but that is arguably for the better in a lot of cases. We already mentioned the lack of suggested articles with engagement bait that could easily draw you in, but another notable omission is the comments section. It is very easy to slip into the comments section at the bottom of an article and spend far too much time reading those. You can still do that in an RSS reader by opening the article in your browser, scrolling down to the comments and diving in. At least in my case, that is a safe amount of friction to prevent me from doing it most of the time. Less is more!</p><h2 id="tips-to-get-you-going">Tips to get you going</h2><ul><li>Many of the websites you open regularly, follow on social media or get a newsletter from, likely have an RSS feed. Look out for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Feed-icon.svg#/media/File:Feed-icon.svg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RSS icon</a> or the words RSS or feed. There are also tools like <a href="https://lighthouseapp.io/tools/feed-finder" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lighthouse</a> that can sniff out the feed for you. That said, my experience is that simply adding the homepage URL of the website into an aggregator usually works.</li><li>Remember my frustration with Facebook as a source of news for new music releases? Turns out there is a much better free solution called <a href="https://muspy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Muspy</a>, where you enter all your favorite artists and it will notify you of their new releases. And guess what? You either get notified via email, or you use your personal RSS feed. Highly recommended!</li><li>Start easy with something like <a href="https://www.theoldreader.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Old Reader</a> or <a href="https://feedly.com/news-reader" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Feedly</a> - both offer relatively generous free tiers. And if you outgrow them or want to try something else, you simply export an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OPML</a> file with all your feeds and import them into your new RSS solution. This is the upside of open standards: freedom, ownership, and portability.</li><li>Once you have more than 5-10 feeds, start putting them into folders/categories. No need to overthink it, but doing this will help you be more selective about the content you read if you’re in a specific mood.</li><li>RSS readers can be great when traveling or whenever your internet connection might be down or spotty. You can set up your RSS client in a way that automatically fetches new content, so when you board the plane and go dark, you can still read through the already downloaded articles. (Beware, though: not all RSS feeds include full content - sometimes they’re more like teasers.)</li><li>Some websites that limit how many articles you can browse for free are actually less strict about content accessed through RSS feeds. There are obvious ethical concerns with abusing this, but it is still an upside, and you are only consuming what they provide.</li><li>If you want to tinker, you can set up an RSS aggregator like <a href="https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FreshRSS</a>, <a href="https://github.com/torne/Tiny-Tiny-RSS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tiny tiny RSS</a> or <a href="https://github.com/fossar/selfoss" target="_blank" rel="noopener">selfoss</a> on a shared web hosting service. If you want to go full self-hosted, there are <a href="https://selfh.st/alternatives/rss-readers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many more options available</a>.</li><li>Get a good mobile app. Try a few before you settle! This is a highly personal choice because even small UI quirks and differences may bother you. If you’re anything like me, you’ll do most of the reading on your phone, so make sure it feels good.</li><li>RSS readers/clients often have bookmarking/starring system which works much like dedicated bookmarking apps.</li><li>Bigger publications often have separate feeds for individual categories or tags - check those to avoid getting your main feed flooded.</li><li>Some websites have very elaborate RSS APIs which allow you to query for specific types of content. For example, <a href="https://info.arxiv.org/help/api/basics.html#quickstart" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arXiv</a> has a really elaborate one, allowing you to only follow specific topics. The documentation is quite complex, so here is a quick example to kick start you:<ul><li><code>https://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=abs:LLM+AND+multilingual&amp;sortBy=submittedDate&amp;sortOrder=descending</code></li><li>The query searches through the most recently submitted papers with the words LLM and multilingual in the abstract.</li></ul></li><li>Do a little cleanup from time to time: unsubscribe from feeds that no longer seem to interest you. It’s fine, no one will take offense, and your attention is too precious to be wasted on stuff that is not for you.</li><li>Don’t know where to start? Check out <a href="https://themeisle.com/blog/rss-feeds-list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this list of 100 most popular RSS feeds</a>, <a href="https://rss.feedspot.com/best_rss_feeds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Feedspot’s 70 most popular feeds</a> or <a href="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/blog-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hostinger’s list of 55 popular blogs</a>. Apart from that, Google is your friend (especially if you start searching for specific topics or niches), and good blogs often link to other blogs - all you need to do is to follow the breadcrumbs.</li></ul><p>Happy RSS-ing!</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>From <a href="https://awsm.nz/digital-id-the-new-chains-of-capitalist-surveillance/">https://awsm.nz/digital-id-the-new-chains-of-capitalist-surveillance/</a></p>



<p>The world is entering an era where identity is no longer a matter of personal relationships, lived experience, or even paperwork. Increasingly, it is reduced to biometric scans, algorithmic verification, and digital tokens. Across the globe, governments and corporations are rolling out digital identification systems, facial recognition passports, biometric driver’s licences, app-based vaccine passes, QR-coded welfare access, and unified digital wallets. The language that accompanies these projects is familiar – efficiency, convenience, modernisation, inclusion. We are told that digital ID will make life easier, reduce fraud, and open new opportunities.</p>



<p>The reality, however, is far more sinister. Identification has never been neutral, it has always been a weapon of power, wielded by states and capitalists to monitor, control, and discipline populations. From passports to colonial passbooks, from welfare cards to border regimes, the apparatus of identification has always been tied to domination. Digital ID is simply the latest iteration of this long history, but with a scale and sophistication that makes its dangers even more profound. Far from liberating us, it is forging new chains and binding us more tightly to systems of surveillance, exclusion, and exploitation.</p>



<p><strong>Identification as Domination</strong></p>



<p>To grasp what digital ID represents, we must situate it within the longer history of identification as a tool of authority. The passport, now normalised as a necessary object of travel, was originally a way for states to restrict movement. In medieval Europe, peasants and serfs required written permission to leave their estates. Colonial regimes across Africa, Asia, and the Pacific perfected these systems of control, forcing indigenous people to carry passes while settlers roamed unhindered. In apartheid South Africa, the “pass laws” criminalised Black South Africans for existing outside their assigned zones, reducing life itself to a bureaucratic calculation of permission.</p>



<p>Identification has never been about protecting the individual; it has been about protecting property relations. States have needed to know who people are in order to tax them, conscript them, and deny them rights. Employers demanded papers to guarantee that workers were legally exploitable. Landlords used identification to screen tenants, banks to gate-keep credit, police to track dissenters. The notion of “identity” under capitalism has always been bound up with surveillance and discipline.</p>



<p>Digital ID does not break from this tradition but it intensifies it. What once required a physical stamp or signature now demands a biometric scan or QR code. Where once a police officer demanded to see your papers, now an algorithm silently determines your access. The shift is not from control to freedom, but from analogue domination to digital domination.</p>



<p><strong>The Logic of Digital ID</strong></p>



<p>Behind the rhetoric of convenience lies the hard logic of capital and the state. Digital ID is not being built for us, it is being built to extend the power of those who already govern our lives.</p>



<p>At its core, digital ID represents the enclosure of access. Increasingly, the essentials of life, healthcare, housing, employment, welfare, travel, are gated behind digital checkpoints. Without the correct identification, people are excluded. This transforms existence itself into a series of permissions, each mediated by algorithmic verification. Access to food, shelter, or work becomes conditional on whether a machine recognises your fingerprint or face.</p>



<p>It also expands surveillance capitalism. Every scan, swipe, or login generates data. This data is stored, tracked, and monetised. Digital ID reduces human beings to data streams, feeding the profits of corporations like Microsoft, Mastercard, and Accenture, companies deeply embedded in global ID initiatives. Far from empowering individuals, digital ID empowers corporations by turning our lives into commodities to be sold.</p>



<p>Digital ID also disciplines labour. By tying welfare payments, work permits, or banking access to digital identity, states and corporations acquire powerful new tools to coerce populations. In India, the Aadhaar biometric system has left millions excluded from rations and pensions when fingerprints failed to scan, producing not efficiency but hunger. Migrant workers across the world are increasingly monitored through digital verification, making precarious labour even more vulnerable.</p>



<p>Perhaps most insidiously, digital ID normalises surveillance itself. By embedding digital checkpoints into daily life, whether entering a building, logging into a service, or accessing healthcare, surveillance becomes routine. What once might have provoked outrage becomes ordinary. Control does not need to be imposed violently when it is integrated seamlessly into the everyday functions of existence.</p>



<p>The consequences of digital ID are not abstract. Around the world, its implementation reveals the sharp edges of exclusion and control.</p>



<p>As already mentioned India’s Aadhaar project, the largest biometric ID system in history, covers over a billion people. It was presented as a means of reducing corruption and expanding access to welfare. In reality, it has excluded millions of poor and rural people from food rations and pensions because their fingerprints did not register. Reports have documented starvation deaths when families were denied grain for lack of proper authentication. For the poor, the system is not convenience, it is a death sentence.</p>



<p>In Europe, digital ID takes a different but equally insidious form. The EU is developing a unified “digital identity wallet” for banking, healthcare, and travel, promoted as freedom for citizens. At the same time, the Eurodac database stores the fingerprints of asylum seekers to enforce deportations and prevent secondary movement. Digital ID here is double-edged, advertised as seamless mobility for the privileged, but functioning as chains for migrants.</p>



<p>Across Africa, the World Bank and multinational corporations are funding digital ID projects under the guise of “financial inclusion.” Tied to mobile money systems, these IDs are less about inclusion than about expanding debt markets and integrating populations into circuits of extraction. They replicate colonial practices where identification was a prerequisite for resource exploitation and labour discipline.</p>



<p>In settler-colonial states like New Zealand and Australia, digital driver’s licences and facial recognition technologies are being trialled under the language of security and convenience. But both countries maintain extensive databases of their populations, and both have long histories of surveillance and repression against indigenous peoples and political activists. Digital ID here strengthens existing patterns of racialised and political control, embedding them in everyday transactions.</p>



<p><strong>The Role of the State</strong></p>



<p>For anarchists, it is no surprise that the state is at the centre of these developments. The state has never been a neutral provider of services. It is a machinery of class rule, designed to enforce property relations and maintain hierarchy. Digital ID offers the state new levels of efficiency in population management. Welfare can be rationed through digital checkpoints, ensuring that only the “deserving” poor receive aid. Policing is strengthened through biometric databases, making dissent and protest more dangerous. Borders become omnipresent, extending into every workplace, clinic, and street corner. Even the ritual of voting is increasingly tied to digital verification, further legitimising the state’s hold.</p>



<p>But the state does not act alone. The infrastructure of digital ID is outsourced to corporations, tech giants and consultancy firms whose profits depend on extracting and selling data. ID2020, the flagship global digital ID initiative, is a partnership between Microsoft, Accenture, Gavi, and Mastercard. This fusion of state power and corporate capital creates a techno-bureaucratic regime that is incredibly difficult to resist at the level of the individual. It is not simply your government demanding your data, it is a web of global corporations embedding control into the infrastructure of daily life.</p>



<p><strong>Resistance and Its Possibilities</strong></p>



<p>And yet, systems of domination are never total. The chains of digital ID can be resisted, but the struggle requires collective defiance. Individuals cannot simply opt out when access to food, housing, or healthcare is increasingly contingent on digital verification. Resistance must be social, coordinated, and rooted in solidarity.</p>



<p>It begins with exposing the lie of convenience. The marketing of digital ID depends on people believing it is in their interests. By revealing its function as surveillance, exclusion, and profit-making, we can puncture the narrative that it is a neutral technological advance. Convenience is the sugar that coats the poison pill.</p>



<p>Resistance also means standing with those most affected by exclusion. When people are denied access to food or healthcare because a machine rejects them, solidarity demands that communities step in. Mutual aid networks, food distribution, and grassroots healthcare can undermine the state’s monopoly on survival. By caring for each other without demanding documents, communities demonstrate the possibility of life beyond identification.</p>



<p>Direct action has its place as well. Surveillance infrastructure can be disrupted, whether through physical sabotage, digital hacktivism, or leaks that expose the collusion of states and corporations. Every act that slows the expansion of digital ID chips away at its inevitability.</p>



<p>Perhaps most crucially, resistance means refusing to internalise the normalisation of surveillance. We must continue to feel anger each time a new checkpoint is introduced, each time a new biometric system is trialled, each time a new database is constructed. The greatest victory of power is not when it controls us, but when it convinces us that control is natural.</p>



<p>Digital ID is not a neutral innovation. It is the frontier of capitalist surveillance and state control. It deepens exploitation, excludes the vulnerable, and integrates every aspect of life into the machinery of profit and domination. Identification has always been a tool of authority, from medieval passes to apartheid laws, and digital ID is the most sophisticated form yet.</p>



<p>The ruling class wants us to believe digital ID is inevitable. But inevitability is the language of power. Systems of domination can be resisted, sabotaged, dismantled. The struggle against digital ID is not about nostalgia for the days of paper documents; it is about defending the very possibility of living without being constantly monitored, verified, and reduced to data.</p>



<p>What is at stake is not simply privacy, but freedom itself.</p>

<p><a href="https://blender.org/">Blender</a> 4.5 LTS <a href="https://www.blender.org/download/releases/4-5/">was released</a>
on July 15, 2025, and will be supported through 2027. This is the last
feature release of the 3D graphics-creation suite's 4.x series; it
includes quality-of-life improvements, including work to bring the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulkan">Vulkan</a> backend up to
par with the default OpenGL backend. With 4.5 released, Blender
developers are turning their attention toward Blender 5.0, planned for
release later this year. It will introduce substantial changes,
particularly in the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/geometry_nodes/introduction.html">Geometry
Nodes</a> system, a central feature of Blender's procedural
workflows.</p>

<h4>Brief introduction</h4>

<p>Blender is an open-source creative application released under the GPLv3.
The <a href="https://www.blender.org/foundation/">Blender Foundation</a>
stewards development, with significant funding from the <a href="https://fund.blender.org/">Blender Development Fund</a> as well
as backing from individual contributors and industry sponsors. Its
code is primarily written in C and <span>C++</span>,
with Python used extensively for scripting and add-ons.</p>

<p>While Blender is often known as a 3D modeling and animation tool,
it has grown into a comprehensive open-source suite for digital
content creation. Alongside powerful 3D tools, it features
compositing, <a href="https://www.blender.org/features/video-editing/">nonlinear
video editing</a>, and 2D animation in 3D space. This integrated suite
of tools enables designers, animators, and other creators to work with
a single application across their digital pipeline. Blender also
provides access to its core functions through <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/interface/controls/nodes/introduction.html">Nodes</a>,
a visual programming system that enables procedural workflows for
complex operations. The <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/grease_pencil/introduction.html">Grease
Pencil tool</a>, also accessible through the Geometry Nodes system, is
used for 2D animation, cut-out animation, motion graphics, and more. Blender's procedural systems rely heavily
on these node-based graphical interfaces, and the 4.5 LTS focuses on
their continued evolution. These systems enable fully non-destructive
workflows, preserving all original data at every stage of the editing
process.</p>

<!-- middle-ad -->

<p>Blender strives to be compatible with visual-effects (VFX) industry
standards through alignment with the <a href="https://vfxplatform.com/">VFX Reference Platform</a>, which is
updated annually. This allows Blender to be run on the same systems as
other VFX software, as well as share files with them. 4.5 brings <a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/136540">a
slew of library updates</a> to maintain alignment with the reference
platform.</p>

<h4>A solid foundation</h4>

<p>Historically, Blender has relied
on <a href="https://www.opengl.org/">OpenGL</a> for drawing its user
interface and powering its 3D-display capabilities. However, efforts
are underway to modernize this aspect of its core functionality
by <a href="https://developer.blender.org/docs/features/gpu/">abstracting
away the rendering backend</a>, bringing support for running on additional
graphics APIs, including Vulkan
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_%28API%29">Apple's
Metal API</a>. The Vulkan API is a
low-overhead, cross-platform standard that allows applications like
Blender to communicate more directly with GPU hardware than OpenGL. Being the
final feature release of the 4.x series, this LTS brings a critical
step in the maturity of
the <a href="https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/4.5/eevee/#vulkan">Vulkan
backend</a>. Though still not enabled by default due to multiple
outstanding issues, it now rivals the OpenGL backend in both features
and performance.</p>

<p>Vulkan is built on a <a href="https://docs.vulkan.org/tutorial/latest/17_Multithreading.html">parallel-execution model</a>, allowing applications to send multiple commands
to the GPU simultaneously, while OpenGL relies on a sequential
model. Vulkan's execution model makes better use of the increased number
of cores found in modern GPUs. This is a <a href="https://code.blender.org/2023/10/vulkan-project-update/">crucial
step</a> toward smoother viewport performance and more responsive
interaction with complex scenes.</p>

<p>There are <a href="https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/4.5/eevee/#limitations">known
limitations</a> still blocking the new backend from being adopted as
the default. Notably, large meshes with 100-million vertices or
more are not yet supported, resulting in poor performance on the
Vulkan backend for virtual reality and other high-mesh-count
applications. Future driver updates may address some of these
issues.</p>

<p>The viewport in Blender is an interactive view space where 3D
scenes are displayed and constructed. Rendering converts 3D scenes
into 2D images or video, producing the final output with Blender's
built-in engines or third-party renderers. Rendering can also be
performed without the graphical interface by running Blender in
headless mode, both on individual systems and at scale on render
farms. The viewport and rendering upgrades in Blender 4.5 extend
beyond the improvements to its Vulkan backend. Specifically, work
continues
on <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/render/eevee/introduction.html">EEVEE</a>,
the realtime rendering engine built for rapid, interactive rendering
on modern GPUs. EEVEE 2.0, also known as EEVEE Next, receives several
critical improvements focused on stability and visual
accuracy. Shadows now render more smoothly thanks to the addition
of <a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/81c00bf272f22dc732b0fc8c9d7db39c5f916a07">shadow
terminator normal bias</a>. This is an area where EEVEE has struggled
to match other renderers, including Blender's
own <a href="https://www.cycles-renderer.org/">Cycles rendering
engine</a>.</p>

<p>Two settings control shadow termination bias: "Geometry Offset" and "Shading
Offset", <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/4.5/render/cycles/object_settings/object_data.html#shading">found
in the "Shading" tab</a> of the "Object Properties" panel. This gives
artists greater control over the position and angle of
shadows. However, due to the difficulties of creating shadows that work
equally well for all projects, the default for these settings is
"no bias". These visual improvements coincide with fixes for rendering
problems such as <a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/b01cdf7df2ba62c66cf0fce4521d65afa46acf52">light
leaking from large light sources</a>. Light leaking is a phenomenon
where light incorrectly passes through or around solid objects,
creating unrealistic bright spots in the rendered scene. Overall,
these changes aim to bring EEVEE Next closer to parity with other
renderers.</p>

<p>Beyond rendering quality, this LTS release delivers 
improvements to workflow fluidity. Texture loading, shader
compilation, and startup times all contribute to overall performance
and user experience, and all
three <a href="https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/4.5/eevee/#performance">have
been improved</a>. Textures are now loaded
using <a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/1d638c0f5e8b90c41fec92147d9fcd286aec015c">a
deferred, multithreaded process</a>, resulting in more than double the
speed of the previous method. This change introduces a small CPU
overhead due to loading textures before redrawing the viewport, but
the cost is not significant enough to severely impact performance.</p>

<p>Shaders
are <a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/1c47e31367b78a770d8ad5452d2e80cab5b51e94">also
now compiled in parallel</a>. Crucially, this
optimization is independent of the viewport backend in use, whether
Vulkan or OpenGL, translating to immediate benefits from these core
improvements. That said,
a <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/4.5/editors/preferences/system.html#:~:text=Shader%20Compilation-,method,-Defines%20the%20method">new
preference</a> allows users to revert to sub-process shader
calculation, if desired, which is faster but consumes more RAM. Additionally, by skipping unnecessary shading
steps during viewport initialization, startup times have been improved
significantly.</p>

<p>With ongoing efforts to improve the workspace, users can
now <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/4.5/editors/properties_editor.html#:~:text=Visible-,tabs,-Allows%20hiding%20specific">control
which tabs are visible</a> in the Properties Editor through the
right-click pop-up
menu. The <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/asset_browser.html">Asset
Browser</a>, used for importing and organizing assets (including
scenes, 3D objects, textures, and more), has been
continually refined throughout the 4.x series. In 4.5 LTS, it receives
some key usability enhancements, particularly in how assets are
displayed, such as wrapping long lines used for asset labels, and
making it easier to create thumbnails for assets.</p>

<h4>Nodes, Grease Pencil, and modeling polish</h4>

<p>Rather than focusing solely on fixes
and <a href="https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/4.5/geometry_nodes/#performance">performance
gains</a>, this cycle emphasized tighter
integration between the various node systems in Blender. The result is
that <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/4.5/editors/shader_editor.html">Shader
Nodes</a>, <a href="http://docs.blender.org/manual/en/4.5/editors/compositor.html">Compositor
Nodes</a>,
and <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/4.5/editors/geometry_node.html">Geometry
Nodes</a> (including Grease Pencil Nodes) now share more capabilities
and have a more consistent workflow.</p>

<p>The common nodes (including mathematical operations)
and <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/4.5/render/materials/legacy_textures/introduction.html">procedural
textures</a> available with Shader Nodes and Geometry Nodes
are <a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/0a80f470f8">now
available</a> for use in the Compositor. This change enables effects
such as procedurally generated visual noise or cloudiness applied to
an image or video during post-processing. Common nodes can be copied
across Shader and Geometry Node setups, further aligning node logic
and capability design across the toolset. In Geometry Nodes, the new
"Set Mesh Normal" node grants artists direct control over custom
normals, which are perpendicular vectors that are used to represent
the orientation of a surface. By allowing users to define normals via
<a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/geometry_nodes/fields.html">Fields</a>,
Blender provides <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/geometry_nodes/mesh/write/set_mesh_normal.html">fine-grained
procedural controls</a> for surface shading. For instance, an animator
could drive this node with a value to simulate a material seamlessly
transitioning from a soft, smooth surface to a rough, hard-edged one,
all without the need for manually editing the mesh.</p>

<p>In
4.5, <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/point_cloud/index.html">Point
Clouds</a> debut
as <a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/75717">a
new object type</a>, accessible from the "Add" menu in the viewport or
through various Geometry Nodes. Point Clouds represent objects as a
group of points in 3D space and have long been used in scientific and
industrial 3D scanning. According to the Blender <a href="https://developer.blender.org/docs/features/objects/pointcloud/#point-cloud-object">developer
documentation on Point Clouds</a>, this new object
type supports motion graphics, physics simulations (including particle systems),
granular materials (such as sand and gravel), and 3D scanning. To this
end, Blender
includes <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/4.5/modeling/point_cloud/tools.html">comprehensive
tools</a>
and <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/4.5/modeling/point_cloud/editing.html">editable
object attributes</a>, including standard transformations like
rotation and scale. It
also <a href="https://developer.blender.org/docs/features/objects/pointcloud/#rendering">maintains
high rendering performance</a> through EEVEE and Cycles, putting point
clouds on par with meshes.</p>

<h4>Looking ahead</h4>

<p>With 4.5 LTS out the door, the Blender developers have shifted
focus to 5.0, the next major release, which is now
under active development. As the beginning of a new, feature-breaking series,
5.0 <a href="https://cgcookie.com/posts/blender-5-0-release-what-do-we-know-and-what-to-look-forward-to">introduces</a>
significant refinements and modernized workflows without abandoning the
<a href="https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/2.80/ui/">user
interface paradigm established by Blender 2.80</a> in 2019. The <a href="https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/5.0/">release
notes</a> outline several key features planned for the release. Among
these improvements is the ability to <a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/ba3eaf3a841388a6e5e44677662be4bffd787e04">mark
scenes as assets</a>, allowing entire scenes with their contents and
setup to be pulled directly into the visual scene editor using the asset browser.</p>

<p>The Grease Pencil
tool in 5.0 <a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/f7a000345201f259b94e754341d1b4925c25e8d1">supports</a> the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_blur_%28media%29">motion
blur</a> effect, controlled by the new "Motion Blur Steps" setting in
the "Grease Pencil" render panel. Linux users now benefit from <a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/140277">HDR
support in the viewport</a> on Wayland when using the Vulkan
backend. Additionally, <a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/59a759b98d1">a
change to the <tt>.blend</tt> file format to handle larger content</a>
allows Blender to store meshes with
more than a few hundred million vertices. This feature <a href="https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/5.0/core/#large-buffers-in-blend-files">required
a change</a> to the file structure of the <tt>.blend</tt> file format, meaning
that files created in version 5.0 are incompatible with Blender 4.4
and prior releases, but can be loaded in 4.5 LTS. While the new format
supports meshes with hundreds of millions of vertices, working with
such files still demands powerful hardware, specifically large amounts
of system RAM and GPU memory.</p>

<p>Blender
5.0 <a href="https://devtalk.blender.org/t/gsoc-2025-edit-mesh-mirror-improvements/40369">improves
symmetry</a> in Edit Mode by ensuring mirrored operations no longer
fail or produce inconsistent
results. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UV_mapping">UV
mapping</a>, the process of unfolding the surface of a 3D model onto a
2D image for applying textures, sees improvements in Blender 5.0
thanks to improved synchronization. This change ensures selections
remain aligned between the viewport and the UV Editor. Blender 5.0
finally resolves this longstanding limitation.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Setting up as a desktop environment</h3><a id="user-content-setting-up-as-a-desktop-environment" aria-label="Permalink: Setting up as a desktop environment" href="#setting-up-as-a-desktop-environment"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">To use this as your main desktop you can run the following commands to set up
fynedesk as a selectable desktop option in your login manager (such as LightDM for example):</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="git clone https://github.com/fyshos/fynedesk
cd fynedesk
make
sudo make install"><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/fyshos/fynedesk
cd fynedesk
make
sudo make install
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">You can now log out and see that it is in your desktop selection list at login.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Debugging a window manager</h3><a id="user-content-debugging-a-window-manager" aria-label="Permalink: Debugging a window manager" href="#debugging-a-window-manager"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">You can also run the window manager components in an embedded X window for testing.
You will need the <code>Xephyr</code> tool installed for your platform (often installed as part of Xorg).
Once it is present you can use the following command from the same directory as above:</p>

<p dir="auto">It should look like this:</p>
<p dir="auto">
  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/FyshOS/fynedesk/blob/master/desktop-dark-current.png"><img src="https://github.com/FyshOS/fynedesk/raw/master/desktop-dark-current.png" alt="Fyne Desktop - Dark"></a>
</p>
<p dir="auto">If you run the command when there is a window manager running, or on
an operating system that does not support window managers (Windows or
macOS) then the app will start in UI test mode.
When loaded in this way you can run all of the features except the
controlling of windows - they will load on your main desktop.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Runner</h2><a id="user-content-runner" aria-label="Permalink: Runner" href="#runner"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">A desktop needs to be rock solid, and whilst we are working hard to get there,
any alpha or beta software can run into unexpected issues.
For that reason, we have included a <code>fynedesk_runner</code> utility that can help
manage unexpected events. If you start the desktop using the runner, then
if a crash occurs, it will normally recover where it left off with no loss
of data in your applications.</p>
<p dir="auto">Using standard Go tools you can install the runner using:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="go get fyshos.com/fynedesk/cmd/fynedesk_runner"><pre><code>go get fyshos.com/fynedesk/cmd/fynedesk_runner
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">From then on execute that instead of the <code>fynedesk</code> command for a more
resilient desktop when testing out pre-release builds.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Design</h2><a id="user-content-design" aria-label="Permalink: Design" href="#design"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Design concepts, and the abstract wallpapers have been contributed by <a href="https://github.com/jostgrant">Jost Grant</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Shipping FyneDesk</h2><a id="user-content-shipping-fynedesk" aria-label="Permalink: Shipping FyneDesk" href="#shipping-fynedesk"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">If you are installing FyneDesk by default on a distribution, or making it available as a standard option, you should consider the following points.
You do not need to ship the library or any dependencies, but it is recommended to add the following apps as well:</p>
<markdown-accessiblity-table><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>app</th>
<th>go get</th>
<th>description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>fin</td>
<td><code>github.com/fyshos/fin</code></td>
<td>A display manager app that matches the look and feel of FyneDesk</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></markdown-accessiblity-table>
<p dir="auto">Please do let us know if you package FyneDesk for your system, so we can include a link from here :).</p>

			Honestly, I think Apple really needs to simplify the iPhone for the elderly. I know there are accessibility modes, but you don’t want to have to go through all that and spend hours trying to customize the phone. Also, the whole phone setup process needs to be delayed; having to go through it for an hour puts them off from even wanting to bother. I first set the phones up to make accounts, but it turns out none of them could understand how to unlock the phone. Entering a passcode was a nightmare because they kept forgetting it, even though it was a birthday they knew, lol.</p><p>

So, I tried Touch ID and Face ID, and that was even more complicated and kept erroring out. Then, the Siri thing kept popping up on the phones with Touch ID, despite turning it off, and the whole swiping from the button kept making the screen go down to the bottom half. :/ There were too many apps; all they wanted was the phone app, but it doesn’t default to the keypad, which was too much for them to find.</p><p>


The phones are too fiddly now, and pressing random things as they try to hold the phone meant the phone got lost in a sea of opening stuff up. So, I tried the assistive access, but why isn’t this an option from the get-go? It asks you the age of setup; why not have a 65+ or something for a senior mode?</p><p>


They don’t need passcodes, accounts, and a sea of information. It’s insane, and it’s insane how fiddly these phones are. I never noticed because I’m used to it, but for these people with hands that barely move, the fake Touch ID button and the swiping from the bottom on Face ID phones seem to be the worst! I think having a proper physical button, like iPhones used to have, would have been superior. The one complaint about the fake button was that it didn’t feel like a real button, so they couldn’t gauge it.</p><p>


I left there achieving nothing because they couldn’t figure out their old Nokia phones. The unlock thing on the keypad was too difficult, and if I turned that off, they kept dialing 999 in their pockets for some reason. That’s why I was there: they were calling emergency services 100 times a day, lol.</p><p>


I think what I’ve realized is that I need to go back with flip phones that answer and hang up when you open and close them. However, the two I tried before didn’t act like that, and they had too many features. I really thought I could make the iPhone simple, but NOPE!</p><p>


Apple should work on their phones to make them more accessible and less fiddly, without having to go through a sea of menus.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://wjgilmore.com/articles/10000-pushups">https://wjgilmore.com/articles/10000-pushups</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45456188">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-mdx-content="true"><p>Headed into 2025 I was fat, out of shape, and lazy. My three young children were running circles around me, and I was increasingly concerned not only about my health in general but about the kind of example I was setting for them. My (very) sedentary job in front of a laptop wasn't helping, nor was the fact that my favorite hobby in the world outside of work is, well, sitting in front of the laptop.</p>
<p>Adding to the general anxiety was the fact I had spent the last two years watching my parents struggle with devastating health issues. My parents had me in their early 20's, so all said they really weren't that much older than I am. My thoughts regularly turned into worry that I'd eventually wind up with my own serious health problems if I didn't get my act together.</p>
<p>I wanted to do something about it, but what? Past attempts to go to a gym weren't successful, and I <em>really</em> did not want to drive any more than I already do serving alongside my wife as a kid taxi. Also, having made half-hearted attempts in the past to get into shape (Orange Theory, P90X, etc) and winding up spending less time exercising than researching the minutiae of max VO2, bicycle construction, and fasting benefits, I knew I had to keep things simple.</p>
<p>While on a post-Christmas family vacation down in Florida I concluded it made sense to set a goal that could help me get into better shape but which also could be completed in small chunks over a long period of time. It was also important that I could do the workout at any point in the day and even in my office if necessary. And thus began the quest to complete 10,000 pushups in one year. Almost 10 months later, this harebrained goal and the many positive effects that came from it changed my life in ways I never imagined.</p>
<h2>January, 2025 - The Pushup Tracker</h2>
<p>While still in Florida I fired up a Google Sheet and added two columns to it: Date and Pushups. And on January 1, 2025 I dropped down and knocked out 30. Well not 30 in a row, mind you. I never could have done that on day 1. It was more like 10, 10, 5, 5 or something like that. Then I wrote it down. On January 2 I upped my game a bit, doing 35 and again immediately logged into the sheet and wrote it down again.</p>
<p>In the days that followed, the reward very much became the opportunity to open that sheet. Can't write the pushup number down if I didn't do the pushups, right? I didn't want to break the chain (although you'll later see I did in fact break the chain plenty of times in the months ahead) and so in the first 31 days I did pushups on 24 of 31 days, logging 1,018 in total and averaging 32.84 per day.</p>
<p>I even worked up the motivation to run on a treadmill one day in January, logging 2.17 miles in 30 minutes on January 14, 2025. Other than that run and pushups, according to my spreadsheet I did no other notable exercise that month.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was also in January that I stopped eating fast food of any type, and as of the day of this writing I've not reversed course on this decision. Long story short we were driving back from <a href="https://codemash.org/">https://codemash.org/</a> and pulled through a McDonalds. I had at that point been eating McDonalds all of my life; nothing over the top mind you, but probably twice a month at least for as long as I can remember. Anyway, the food that day was rancid. Legitimately nauseating. I have no idea why it was that way but I was so turned off that right there and then I swore I'd never touch it again. Coincidentally, over this past weekend I was on a walk and reflecting on some of what I'd been writing in this blog post, and my thoughts turned towards diet. When was the last time you heard somebody (including yourself) say they feel better after eating fast food? We all know the answer to this question: never. This stuff is not food and I feel so much better staying away from this poison.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>February, 2025 - Winter Blues Set In</h2>
<p>Whether it was due to the winter blues or that shiny New Year's resolution already starting to fade, I only logged 848 pushups on 21 of 28 days in February. But I definitely seemed to be getting stronger, averaging 44.63 pushups on those days, and  managed to log a daily high of 117 pushups on February 9, 2025. By the end of February I had logged 1,876 pushups. According to my spreadsheet I also managed to lift weights on February 1, 4, and 10. I have a pretty basic weight set in the basement and although I can't recall the specifics, I was probably standing around listening to CNBC on my phone most of the time.</p>
<h2>March, 2025 - Will the Sun Ever Shine Again?</h2>
<p>I'm not going to sugarcoat it; March was bad, real bad. I only logged 206 pushups on 9 days, averaging 22.9 pushups on those days. It's unclear to me why I'd tailed off so much other than to imagine old man winter was really starting to weigh on me by that point. Even so, those 206 pushups took me to a total of 2,082 pushups for the year.</p>
<h2>April, 2025 - The Sun is Shining Again</h2>
<p>In April my pace picked back up along with the improving weather and increasing sunlight. I completed 375 pushups on 13 days, averaging 28.84 pushups on those days. However I also managed to lift weights on six days in April, went on a run on April 14, and even gave fasting a go for a 28 hour period between April 2-April 3 (not sure I'll do that again).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another lifestyle change unexpectedly happened in April: I basically quit drinking alcohol, wine in particular. This decision was a pretty simple one because as I've gotten older, the hangovers have gotten worse, and my sleep quality has gotten much worse, anytime I drank more than 1-2 drinks. As of this writing (September 28, 2025) I've had maybe 2-3 glasses of wine in almost 5 months. My new alcoholic drink of choice when I feel like having something? Miller Lite. It has low calories, low alcohol content, and you can buy a 12 pack for as much as one bottle of wine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Adding 375 pushups to the pile took me to a total of 2,457 pushups for 2025.</p>
<h2>May, 2025 - Can I Do a Split?</h2>
<p>Likely due to fear I was going to enter yet another summer rocking the "dad bod", my exercise intensity soared in May. I completed 1,281 pushups over 25 days, averaging 51.24 pushups on those days. On five of those days I completed more than 100 pushups, and on May 18 completed a YTD single day high of 150.</p>
<p>I also became mildly obsessed with the idea of doing a split. While browsing Libby as I love to do at night, I found the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Even-Stiffest-People-Can-Splits/dp/1635651786">Even the Stiffest People Can Do the Splits</a>. The cover showed the author smiling and doing a full split, and I thought well if Eiko says even stiff people can do it then maybe I can too.</p>
<p><img alt="Even the Stiffest People Can Do the Splits" loading="lazy" width="293" height="304" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fsplits-book.4dcd7165.png&amp;w=384&amp;q=75 1x, https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fsplits-book.4dcd7165.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fsplits-book.4dcd7165.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=75"></p><p>Over the course of May I did the splits workout 15 times, and undoubtedly became far more flexible although I never did quite reach a complete split. This continued into June and early July however for reasons I'll explain in a moment I stopped doing the regiment out of fear I'd get hurt. However, to this day I stretch daily and of all the different exercise routines I've tried this year I think aggressive stretching has perhaps had the most ROI of them all.</p>
<p>On May 15 I ran a 5K with my daughter (well she sped ahead of me after mile 1), completing it in 32:50. Not too bad considering according to my log I ran exactly four times in 2025.</p>
<p>Headed into June I had completed a grand total of 3,738 pushups.</p>
<h2>June, 2025 and Doing Pushups at Versailles</h2>
<p>June is where things really started to get exciting. Every year <a href="https://xenon.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xenon Partners</a> runs a friendly intercontinental pushup contest. "Friendly" is a relative term considering I work with numerous combat veterans, retired members of the United States and Australian military services, and a former Mr. Australia contestant. I also spent some time in France with the family, attending the 24 Hours of Le Mans race (amazing btw) and sightseeing around the country, meaning I had to fit pushups in whenever possible, including at Versailles:</p>
<p><img alt="Doing pushups at the Palace of Versailles" loading="lazy" width="240" height="320" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fversailles.43c53bb4.png&amp;w=256&amp;q=75 1x, https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fversailles.43c53bb4.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fversailles.43c53bb4.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=75"></p><p>In June my output soared to 2,014 pushups, and despite all of the traveling managed to do pushups on 24 of 30 days, averaging 91.55 pushups per day. I also set multiple PRs in June, doing 205 pushups on June 1, 222 on June 15, and then 300 on June 27. As of June 30 I had completed a total of 5,752 pushups.</p>
<h2>July, 2025 and the 5/15/500 Race</h2>
<p>Upon returning from Europe I got the bright idea to organize a race called the 5/15/500 Challenge. This involved running 5 miles, biking 15 miles, and then completing 500 body weight exercises. Nevermind that I'd run maybe four times in 2025 and hadn't been on my bike once. Many of my neighbors joined the fun, and we even had t-shirts printed for the occasion. Of course, <a href="https://dumbolympics-absurd-website-antics.lovable.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I also created a website</a>. I did this because I figured having an artificially imposed deadline was going to force me to exercise more often. Mission accomplished.</p>
<p><img alt="My birthday race" loading="lazy" width="1595" height="921" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2F515500.faa31dc5.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2F515500.faa31dc5.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2F515500.faa31dc5.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p><p>In July I completed 2,002 pushups, ran 48.88 miles, and biked 28.99 miles (this includes the race day numbers). The heat throughout the month was often unbearable, but I pushed through all the same knowing July 26 (race day) was coming up quick. During this period I also really began to dial in my diet, eating little more than fruit, eggs (lots of eggs), chicken, rice, and salad (lots of salad). It was during this period and August that my body began to change. I became noticeably larger and more muscular, and incredibly my abs began to show.</p>
<p>In this photo I'm completing race pushup #500. Don't judge the form, it was almost 90 degrees and the exhaustion was real from having already completed the run and bike segments. That said if you squint in the right light you can see I actually have muscles due to all the pushups and running!</p>
<p><img alt="Pushup 500 at my birthday race" loading="lazy" width="240" height="320" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fdo.653130c8.png&amp;w=256&amp;q=75 1x, https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fdo.653130c8.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fdo.653130c8.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=75"></p><p>Due to all of the July training and the 5/15/500 Challenge, my YTD pushup output soared to 7,754.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was around this time that I went down a major rabbit hole regarding microplastics. A successful techie named Nat Friedman funded a study that looked into the prevalency of microplastics in food, vitamins, and other products, and published the results <a href="https://www.plasticlist.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. I'm not going to call out any products by name here (although I should because they are poisoning us), but take a moment to open this site in a new tab and search for <em>protein</em> for a glimpse into how you are being poisoned every time you take a bite of so-called health food. After spending a few weeks researching this topic I radically changed my diet and eliminated all of this nonsense. If you <em>really</em> want to go down a rabbit hole, look into the relationship between chocolate-infused health products and heavy metals.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>August, 2025 - Bought a Running Watch</h2>
<p>In August I did exactly 1,000 pushups, and threw in 190 body weight squats just for fun. 525 of these pushups were completed in a single day (August 16) thanks to my neighbor, friend, and fellow 5/15/500 contestant Charlie having the bright idea that we should knock out what was originally supposed to be 400 pushups during our sons' soccer game. Of course, our competitive spirit got the best of us and I quit at 525 while Charlie pushed on to 600. I'll get him the next time!</p>
<p>The running sessions continued throughout August, with 37.48 miles completed. I started taking running much more seriously at this point because I signed up for the October 19 Columbus 1/2 Marathon. I've run 1/2 marathons before (poorly - my last finish time was 3:05) so I know what I'm getting into here, but this time around I want to actually finish at what I deem to be a respectable time which is around 2:20 (10:40/mile pace). Of course, in order to train for this I needed to know what pace I'm running in the first place, and so I bought a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B092RCLKHN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Garmin Forerunner 55</a> watch with GPS.</p>
<p>As mentioned before my proclivity for going down research rabbit holes hasn't really helped my previous attempts to get into shape so I chose this watch because compared to other watches it is relatively spartan in terms of features. Above all else I wanted a watch that can accurately track my running distance, pace, and route and so far I am so, so happy with this purchase. It is perfect, and the battery life is amazing.</p>
<p>On August 2 I received the watch and later that day took my son and his friend up to a local (Alum Creek) mountain bike park and while they were riding I decided to run the trails. I wound up running 4.69 miles on very hilly and bumpy trails, and paid for it dearly over the next week due to terrible foot and knee pain.</p>
<p>On August 21 I ran my first training 10K, completing it in 1:12:28. According to my fancy watch I completed the first 5K in 39:11 but then sped up and completed the second 5K in 33:11.</p>
<p>On August 25 I repeated the route, this time completing the 10K in 1:05:41. On August 28 I did it a third time, completing it in 1:02:47. Progress!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I brought some help to the the August 25 and 28 10K training runs: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DP6ZWWC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GU packs</a>. In July I read the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Swim-Bike-Bonk-Confessions-Triathlete/dp/1493059378/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Swim, Bike, Bonk: Confessions of a Reluctant Triathlete</a>, by Will McGough. In this hilarious recounting of training and competing in an Ironman triathlon, the author mentions using these mysterious "gel" pack, of which the most popular is known as a "GU pack". I subsequently picked up a few at the local Walmart and can confirm they unquestionably gave me a boost on these long runs. Now anytime I plan on running a 10K or longer I put one in my running pouch and open it 5K into the route.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With another 1,000 pushups in the book my YTD output sat at 8,754 on August 31.</p>
<p>Much better endurance aside, the most obvious visible outcome of the last few months is my clothes no longer fit. My polo shirts are so baggy they look like tents, and my t-shirts are too small because I'm so much more... muscular? What in the hell is going on? This seems to be working!</p>
<h2>September, 2025 - I am a Beast</h2>
<p>With 8,754 pushups complete, I only had 1,246 to go and concluded I'd meet the milestone in September. With the 1/2 marathon around the corner my running workouts picked up and I set multiple PRs, including a 29:51 5K PR on September 8, followed by another 28:10 5K PR on September 11.</p>
<p>On September 17 I got one of the biggest motivational boosts possible. I was in Chicago for a quarterly meeting, and one of the fellow board members who I've seen in person once every 3 months (but not 3 months ago because we were on the France trip) walked up to me and introduced himself. I stared back at him completely puzzled, and watched him walk away to greet the person next to me. He suddenly wheeled around with a look of shock on his face and said something to the effect of "Holy shit! I didn't even recognize you! You look amazing!".</p>
<p>On September 21 I completed the 10,000th pushup in unceremonious fashion on my living room floor:</p>
<p><img alt="Pushup number 10,000 in the books" loading="lazy" width="240" height="320" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2F10002.a6a6af52.png&amp;w=256&amp;q=75 1x, https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2F10002.a6a6af52.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2F10002.a6a6af52.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=75"></p><p>On September 24 I gobbled up a GU pack and headed outside feeling like I could tear a phone book in half. My goal was to shatter the previous 28:10 5K record, and I was on track to do exactly that, running the first 2.1 kilometers in 18 minutes flat. Then out of nowhere I felt this terrible pain in my left calf and came to an immediate stop. It wasn't until September 29 that I could comfortably run again, and even then I only ran 1 mile because I'm terrified of a nagging injury setting me back for the October 19 1/2 marathon.</p>
<p>In September I added 1,501 pushups to the pile, bringing the YTD total to 10,245.</p>
<h2>October and Beyond</h2>
<p>Today is October 1, 2025 and the pushups continue. The aforementioned 1/2 marathon is on October 19, and my neighbor Charlie and I have already agreed to walk/run a full marathon (around our neighborhood) on November 29. Although it's almost 80 degrees today, in past years we've seen snow by the end of the month so I'm thinking about getting one of those fancy stationary bikes or maybe even a treadmill so I can keep this party going over the winter.</p>
<h2>My Diet</h2>
<p>In recent months I have started to look so different that friends have asked me for some diet details. As mentioned, I no longer eat fast food, nor overconsume alcohol. But I've also almost completely cut out processed foods, eating them only very sparingly. A few months ago I did manage to go down the microplastics and heavy metals rabbit hole, and now spend some time researching anything that I plan on eating on a regular basis. Believe me, a lot of the food you think is healthy is pure garbage.</p>
<p>Every morning I eat one of two things: either a gigantic fruit smoothie or four scrambled eggs and a salad. I do not deviate from this, only very occasionally eating some protein-powder pancakes made by my wife. My smoothie consists of milk, greek yogurt, 1.5 scoops of Optimum Nutrition protein powder, a huge scoop (probably two cups) of frozen organic berries, and an entire banana:</p>
<p><img alt="My morning smoothie" loading="lazy" width="240" height="320" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fsmoothie.467ebf50.png&amp;w=256&amp;q=75 1x, https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fsmoothie.467ebf50.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fsmoothie.467ebf50.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=75"></p><p>Here is the typical scrambled eggs and salad breakfast:</p>
<p><img alt="Eggs and salad" loading="lazy" width="240" height="320" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Feggs.544b1751.png&amp;w=256&amp;q=75 1x, https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Feggs.544b1751.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Feggs.544b1751.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=75"></p><p>For lunch I eat some combination of chicken, rice, tuna, and salad. I almost never deviate from this. For dinner I eat whatever my wife decides to make, which is always healthy. Obviously we occasionally go out and I'll eat some garbage like wings or pizza, but this is pretty rare compared to the past. I also take a few vitamins and creatine daily.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Earlier in this post I mentioned researching the prevalency of microplastics, heavy metals, and other poison in food. This is particularly problematic in ironically protein powder, protein bars, protein shakes, etc. I settled on Optimum Nutrition because it is one of the few powders on the market that has been tested by numerous third-parties, including <a href="https://cleanlabelproject.org/protein-powder-v2-category-tested-products/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Clean Label Project</a>. It's pretty expensive compared to other products, but I'm happy to pay in order to avoid ingesting this garbage.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Some Analytics</h2>
<p>Despite getting myself into incredibly good shape relative to the past, this wasn't really that hard. On 105 of 274 days (38.3%) I did no pushups at all. On 142 of 274 (51.8%) days I did between 1 and 100 pushups. On just 26 of 274 (9.4%) days did I do more than 100 pushups, and on only 8 of 274 (2.9%) days did I do 200 or greater. Interestingly, although I have no hard data to back this up I feel like my strength soared in the 67 days following the 5/15/500 race (July 26). Following that date I did more than 100 pushups on 11 days (16.4% of the days), and became noticeably more muscular. Here's a chart showing the pushup volume throughout the year:</p>
<p><img alt="Pushups chart" loading="lazy" width="882" height="547" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fchart.44322d85.png&amp;w=1080&amp;q=75 1x, https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fchart.44322d85.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://wjgilmore.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fchart.44322d85.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75"></p><h2>In Conclusion</h2>
<p>Headed into October, I feel like a million dollars and plan on continuing these off-the-wall exercise quests for the rest of my (hopefully long) life. I obviously have no idea what I'm doing, but am happy to answer any questions and help motivate you to get in the best shape of your life.

When the first lines of </span><em>Beowulf</em><span> are written in a modern edition, they look like this:</span></p><blockquote><p><em><span>Hwæt, we Gardena in geardagum</span><br><span>þeodcyninga þrym gefrunon,</span></em></p><p>‘How we have heard of the glory of the kings of the spear-Danes in days of old’ </p><p><span>(</span><em>Beowulf </em><span>1–2)</span></p></blockquote><p>But in the manuscript, they’re written like this:</p><blockquote><p><em><span>HǷÆT ǷE GARDE</span><br><span>na in</span><strong>ᵹ</strong><span>ear da</span><strong>ᵹ</strong><span>um þeod cynin</span><strong>ᵹ</strong><span>a</span><br><span>þrym </span><strong>ᵹ</strong><span>efrunon</span></em></p><p><em>London, British Library, Cotton MS Vitellius A XV, f. 132r.</em></p></blockquote><p>Now, there’s clearly lots of other weird stuff going on in the manuscript, but focus on how the ‘g’ is represented. While the majuscule (capital) ‘G’ in ‘gardena’ is spelled more like a modern ‘g,’ all the others are insular ‘ᵹ.’</p><p><span>Interestingly, the Anglo-Saxons </span><em>did</em><span> use the Carolingian ‘g’ — just not for Old English. They used it when writing Latin, at least after the late 10th century. This was when the Church in England underwent a set of reforms, which caused a flowering of literature both in Latin and Old English.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3-172153870" href="https://www.deadlanguagesociety.com/p/history-of-letter-yogh#footnote-3-172153870" target="_self" rel="">3</a></span><span> As part of these reforms, the Carolingian minuscule script was adopted for Latin texts.</span></p><p>So for a period, both ‘g’ and ‘ᵹ’ were used in England, but generally speaking, each was used for writing the ‘g’ sound in a different language. Simple enough, but the stage was set for things to get a lot more complicated. </p><p>But for that, we need the help of the Normans.</p><p><em><span>You're reading </span><strong>The Dead Language Society</strong><span>.

In fact, writing in English of any kind was very scarce up until the end of the 12th century.</p><p>Over the course of that tumultuous — and, for English, silent — century, the language had changed a great deal. All the scribes trained in the old, Anglo-Saxon traditions were long dead, so when a new generation of scribes turned their attention once again to English, they had to devise some new strategies for writing it.</p><p>And this, after a surprisingly long delay, is where we first meet the star of today’s issue: ‘ȝ,’ also known as yogh. </p><p><span>Yogh is descended from a variant form of the old insular ‘ᵹ.’ But, while the insular ‘ᵹ’ was thought of as the same letter as the Carolingian ‘g’ in Anglo-Saxon times, the yogh ‘ȝ’ of the 12th century was an </span><em>entirely different letter</em><span> from the Carolingian-derived ‘g.’</span></p><p><span>And, stranger still, ‘ȝ’ was used to write two completely different sounds in Middle English, the form of English spoken from around 1100–1450: the </span><em>y</em><span>-sound as in </span><em><strong>y</strong><span>oung </span></em><span>or </span><em><strong>y</strong><span>esterday</span></em><span>, and another sound that English has lost altogether.</span></p><p><span>The other sound that ‘ȝ’ once spelled is the “harsh” or “guttural” sound made in the back of the mouth, which you hear in Scots </span><em><span>lo</span><strong>ch</strong></em><strong> </strong><span>or German </span><em><span>Ba</span><strong>ch</strong></em><span>.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4-172153870" href="https://www.deadlanguagesociety.com/p/history-of-letter-yogh#footnote-4-172153870" target="_self" rel="">4</a></span><span> This sound is actually the reason for the most famous bit of English spelling chaos: the sometimes-silent, sometimes-not sequence ‘gh’ that you see in </span><em><span>lau</span><strong>gh</strong></em><span>, </span><em><span>cou</span><strong>gh</strong></em><strong>,</strong><em><span> ni</span><strong>gh</strong><span>t</span></em><span>, and </span><em><span>dau</span><strong>gh</strong><span>ter</span></em><span>.

So perhaps it shouldn’t surprise us that we too have a very yogh-like situation with two of our letters: ‘c’ and — wait for it — ‘g.’</p><p><span>Each of these regularly represents two not particularly similar sounds. The letter ‘c’ sometimes represents a </span><em>k</em><span>-sound, like in </span><em><strong>c</strong><span>at</span></em><span>, and sometimes an </span><em>s</em><span>-sound, like in </span><em><strong>c</strong><span>ity</span></em><span>. The letter ‘g’ is similar: sometimes it writes a true </span><em>g</em><span>-sound, like in </span><em><strong>g</strong><span>ood</span></em><span>, but other times, what it represents is a </span><em>j</em><span>-sound, like in </span><em><strong>g</strong><span>em</span></em><span>.</span></p><p><span>If these sounds seem similar to you, pay attention to your tongue as you make each one: the </span><em>k</em><span>-sound and the true </span><em>g-</em><span>sound are made with the back of your tongue hitting against your soft palate. The </span><em>s</em><span>-sound and the ‘j’ sound are made in slightly different places, but in both cases, they use the tip of your tongue coming up against (or close to) just behind your upper teeth.</span></p><p><span>Each of our two double-sounding letters, ‘c’ and ‘g,’ has two variants, which are made at completely different ends of the mouth. This is how yogh worked too: it had one variant made at the back of the mouth (the </span><em>gh</em><span>-sound) and the other made towards the front (that’s the </span><em>y</em><span>-sound).</span></p><p><span>There’s actually a good linguistic reason why this pattern keeps happening. It’s a sound change called </span><strong>palatalization</strong><span>: this happens when a sound made towards the back of the mouth, like a </span><em>k</em><span>- or </span><em>g</em><span>-sound, gets pulled forward because it’s next to another sound made at the front of the mouth. Often, these front-of-the-mouth sounds are vowels.</span></p><p><span>In Old English, these front-of-the-mouth vowels (</span><strong>front vowels</strong><span> for short) included the ones spelled ‘i’ and ‘e,’ which sounded like the vowels in </span><em><span>b</span><strong>ee</strong><span> </span></em><span>and </span><em><span>b</span><strong>ay</strong></em><span>.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-5-172153870" href="https://www.deadlanguagesociety.com/p/history-of-letter-yogh#footnote-5-172153870" target="_self" rel="">5</a></span><span> Sometime in the deep prehistory of the English language, the ‘g’ sound got pulled forward in the mouth to sound like ‘y’ whenever it was next to these front vowels.</span></p><p><span>But when it came time to spell these ‘y’ sounds in the Latin alphabet, they still seemed to the Anglo-Saxon scribes to be versions of ‘g’ sounds. So they spelled them ‘ᵹ’ just like they spelled other ‘g’ sounds. This is why, when you read Old English, you can often replace ‘ᵹ’ (or ‘g’ in modern editions) with ‘y’ and get recognizable Modern English words: </span><em><strong>ᵹ</strong><span>ear</span></em><span> is </span><em><strong>y</strong><span>ear</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>dæ</span><strong>ᵹ</strong></em><span> is </span><em>day</em><span>, </span><em><span>we</span><strong>ᵹ</strong><span> </span></em><span>is </span><em><span>wa</span><strong>y</strong></em><span>.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-6-172153870" href="https://www.deadlanguagesociety.com/p/history-of-letter-yogh#footnote-6-172153870" target="_self" rel="">6</a></span></p><p>A process like this happened in the ancestor of French too, just slightly differently. Instead of the ‘g’ being pulled forward into a ‘y’ sound before ‘i’ and ‘e,’ it got pulled forward into a ‘j’ sound. </p><p><span>This is why the Modern English ‘g’ represents two sounds, one before the letters ‘i’ and ‘e’, and the other before the other letters. It’s because we took our spelling conventions from how the Norman scribes wrote their language, which was an old form of French.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-7-172153870" href="https://www.deadlanguagesociety.com/p/history-of-letter-yogh#footnote-7-172153870" target="_self" rel="">7</a></span></p><p><span>While the Norman scribes, and the later English scribes they trained, were used to the letter ‘g’ writing two different sounds, neither was a </span><em>y</em><span>-sound. They needed another letter for that, and they found one: the old insular ‘ᵹ,’ or rather, its descendant, the yogh ‘ȝ.’</span></p><p><span>So that’s why ‘ȝ’ spelled a ‘y’ sound. To understand why ‘ȝ’ also spelled that vanished ‘gh’ sound, however, we need to go back into the distant history of English, long before it was ever written down. Actually, long before there even </span><em>was</em><span> an English. </span></p><p>Back then, there was just one single language, which would later split into English, Dutch, German, Swedish, and all the other Germanic languages.</p><p><span>In this Proto-Germanic language (as it’s called today), the sound that would become the English </span><em>g</em><span>-sound — which the Anglo-Saxons would later spell ‘ᵹ’ — was not the </span><em>g</em><span>-sound we have today in words like </span><em><strong>g</strong><span>ood</span></em><span> or </span><em><span>ba</span><strong>g</strong></em><span>. That came later.</span></p><p><span>Instead, the Proto-Germanic ancestor of words like </span><em>good</em><span> had a sound very similar to the later Middle English </span><em>gh</em><span>-sound at the start.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-8-172153870" href="https://www.deadlanguagesociety.com/p/history-of-letter-yogh#footnote-8-172153870" target="_self" rel="">8</a></span><span> Only later would English harden that </span><em>gh</em><span>-sound into the </span><em>g</em><span>-sound we know today. But this only happened in certain places in the word, especially at the start. At the end of the word, the </span><em>gh</em><span>-sound remained. In Old English, both versions were spelled the same: ‘ᵹ.’</span></p><p><span>This means that ‘ᵹ’ actually had </span><strong>three</strong><span> pronunciations in Old English, not two: the </span><em>y</em><span>-sound (next to front vowels), the </span><em>g</em><span>-sound (at the start of words), and the </span><em>gh</em><span>-sound (in the middle of words).

But you just have to know the words in order to figure that out.</span></p><p><span>As inconvenient as this confusion is for us </span><a href="https://www.deadlanguagesociety.com/p/the-case-for-middle-english" rel="">modern readers of Middle English</a><span>, that isn’t the reason yogh disappeared from the English language. The fate of yogh was sealed by a conspiracy of factors.</span></p><p><span>One is that yogh was never the only alternative for writing the sounds it wrote. The </span><em>y</em><span>-sound could also be written in the way the French wrote it, that is, ‘i’ or ‘y.’ The latter is the spelling that English ended up using for this sound, hence </span><em><strong>y</strong><span>ourself </span></em><span>instead of </span><em><strong>ȝ</strong><span>ourself</span></em><span>. The </span><em>gh</em><span>-sound could also be written ‘h,’ ‘ȝh,’ or ‘gh.’ The last of these, of course, is what English ended up adopting.</span></p><p><span>But the death blow dealt to yogh was the printing press. The earliest printing press in England was a Flemish import, as were the typefaces. But the yogh letter was unique to English, and like the </span><a href="https://www.deadlanguagesociety.com/p/the-lost-letters-of-the-english-alphabet" rel="">other letters unique to English</a><span>, it would be expensive to print. And, as we just saw, there were ready alternatives, so yogh disappeared without a trace… from English.</span></p><p><span>In Scotland, on the other hand, it stuck around for longer. Scots used the combination ‘lȝ’ to represent an ‘ly’ sequence like we have in </span><em><span>mi</span><strong>lli</strong><span>on,</span></em><span> and ‘nȝ’ to represent either the ‘ny’ sequence like in </span><em><span>ca</span><strong>ny</strong><span>on,</span></em><span> or an ‘ng’ sound like in </span><em><span>si</span><strong>ng</strong><span>er</span></em><span>. </span></p><p>And Scottish printers were more eager to keep it than English printers were. So they took advantage of the visual similarity between ‘ȝ’ and ‘z’ — most forms of cursive writing in English still write ‘z’ like ‘ȝ’ — to write their yoghs with ‘z’s.</p><p><span>You still see the results of this substitution, ‘lz’ and ‘nz,’ in certain Scottish names. But the ‘z’ has led them to be pronounced in ways that have nothing to do with their traditional forms. So </span><em>Menzies</em><span> and </span><em>Mackenzie</em><span> were meant to spell things that sounded more like </span><em>Mingus</em><span> and </span><em>Mackenyie</em><span>.</span></p><p>And that’s how one single letter of the Middle English alphabet ended up being pronounced like ‘y,’ ‘gh,’ or even eventually like ‘z.’ I warned you it would be complicated. </p><p>But the journey through the history of yogh has allowed us to peer down some interesting side alleys of the history of writing, from Carolingian scribal practices to the compromises of Scottish printers.</p><p>I don’t lament the loss of yogh myself, not nearly as much as I lament the fate of other lost letters. But if the cause of yogh is one ȝou fancy taking up ȝourself, there’s nothing standing in ȝour waȝ (it’s included in many modern fonts), althouȝ I can imagine hiȝer causes to aspire to.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Chinese scientists have genetically engineered stem cells capable of rejuvenating the health, including the cognition, of aged macaque</p><div>
<p>Key Points:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>“Super stem cells” improve the memory of monkeys while protecting against neurodegeneration.&nbsp;</li>



<li>The super stem cells prevent age-related bone loss while rejuvenating over 50% of the 61 tissues analyzed.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Treatment with stem cells reduces inflammation and senescent cells (cells that accumulate to promote aging).</li>
</ul>



<p>While small in number, our adult stem cells play a crucial role in regenerating our lost or damaged tissues, rebuilding our body cell by cell. However, with age, our bodies become riddled with inflammation, hardly providing an environment capable of keeping our stem cells healthy. Eventually, our stem cells lose their regenerative capacity, contributing to degenerative aging.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Fox, O, Three&nbsp;</h2>



<p><em>Hydra</em> are a genus of immortal beings that live forever in freshwater environments like lakes and ponds. What scientists have called “<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1440-169X.2009.01143.x">nothing but an active stem cell community</a>,” <em>Hydra</em> can escape death by infinitely regenerating. Their stem cells can continuously proliferate and renew by producing FoxO, a protein they share with humans.&nbsp;</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="808" height="476" src="https://cms.nad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Hydra.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://cms.nad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Hydra.jpeg 808w, https://cms.nad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Hydra-300x177.jpeg 300w, https://cms.nad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Hydra-768x452.jpeg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 808px) 100vw, 808px"><figcaption>(Image: <a href="https://www.aip.org/inside-science/how-hydra-regrow-their-heads">aip.org</a>) <strong>The Immortal Hydra.</strong></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>In humans, the FoxO protein, specifically the FoxO3 isoform, responds to cellular stress by binding to DNA and turning genes on and off. These genes are involved in numerous cellular processes that promote healthy aging and extended lifespan. This is why the FoxO3 protein’s corresponding gene, <em>FOXO3</em>, is considered a longevity gene.</p>





<h2>Experimenting with SRCs&nbsp;</h2>



<p>As FoxO3 assists cells in resisting stressful environments, such as inflamed tissue, Chinese Academy of Sciences researchers engineered human stem cells to have enhanced FoxO3 activity. As published in <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674%2825%2900571-9"><em>Cell</em></a>, these senescence-resistant stem cells (SRCs) were designed to exhibit greater resistance to age-related stress. To test this, cynomolgus monkeys, also known as crab-eating macaques, were first stratified into four groups based on age:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>A1: 3-5 years (approximately equivalent to 9-15 human years)&nbsp;</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li>A2: 10-12 years (approximately equivalent to 30-36 human years)&nbsp;</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li>A3: 16-19 years (approximately equivalent to 48-57 human years)&nbsp;</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li>A4: 19-23 years (approximately equivalent to 57-69 human years)&nbsp;</li>
</ul>







<p>The oldest of the monkeys, the A4 group, were the focus of the study and were subdivided into three groups. One group was injected with saline (salt and water), another group with normal stem cells, and the third with SRCs. The aged monkeys were injected every two weeks for 44 weeks, approximately equivalent to the duration of three human years. On safety, there were no serious adverse events, such as immune system rejection or tumor growth.&nbsp;</p>

The WTCs are human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) harboring two copies of normal/wild-type <em>FOXO3 </em>(<em>FOXO3</em><sup>+/+</sup>), while the SRCs are edited. The genetically edited <em>FOXO3</em> gene (<em>FOXO3</em><sup>2SA/2SA</sup>) produces a modified FoxO3 protein that stays in the nucleus of cells to increase the transcriptional activity of protective genes. &nbsp;</figcaption></figure></div>


<h2>SRCs Improve Cognition&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>



<p>After 44 weeks of biweekly injections, a suite of biological indices was measured from the aged monkeys to assess whether SRCs slow down biological aging. One of these indices was memory retention. To assess memory, the researchers conducted a common experiment called the Wisconsin General Test Apparatus (WGTA).&nbsp;</p>



<p>For this experiment, each monkey was trained to retrieve food located <em>outside</em> of one of two identical boxes. During the test session, after each monkey was trained, food was placed next to one of the boxes to keep it hidden. Subsequently, a flap was placed in front of the monkey to block the boxes from view. Three seconds later, when the flap was reopened, each monkey had to remember which of the two boxes contained the food.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Remarkably, the monkeys injected with SRCs remembered the location of the food with higher accuracy than the monkeys injected with saline. Moreover, the monkeys injected with normal stem cells exhibited the same level of accuracy as the monkeys injected with saline. These findings suggest that SRCs, and not normal stem cells, improve the memory of aged monkeys.&nbsp;</p>

The difference in accuracy between the saline-injected (black) and normal/wild-type stem cell-injected (blue) monkeys was not significant (ns).</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Furthermore, MRI-based structural analysis showed that treatment with SRCs mitigated age-related brain shrinkage. MRI-based experiments also revealed that brain connectivity was restored to that of young (A1 group) monkeys. Namely, the structural connectivity between seven brain regions, including those important for working memory (prefrontal cortex), was rejuvenated with SRC treatment. Overall, these findings suggest that SRC injections improve memory by protecting against neurodegeneration.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>SRCs Rejuvenate Many Organs and Tissues</h2>



<p>In addition to the brain, the Academy researchers found that SRC treatment rejuvenated multiple organs and tissues. This is important because the rejuvenation of a given organ or tissue could lead to the reduced risk of its corresponding age-related chronic diseases. For example, the rejuvenating effects of SRCs on the brain could reduce the risk of neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>One common age-related disease is osteoporosis, characterized by brittle and weak bones that make patients more prone to fractures and <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10338097/">deadly falls</a>. Using an X-ray imaging technique called micro-CT, the researchers found evidence for the reversal of age-related bone loss. Namely, while the aged monkeys treated with saline exhibited dental bone loss, the aged monkeys treated with SRCs had teeth more similar to those of young monkeys.&nbsp;</p>


<div>

However, aged monkeys treated with wild-type stem cells (A4-WTC) show less bone loss, while aged monkeys treated with SRCs (A4-SRC) show even less bone loss.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>To conduct a body-wide assessment, the researchers measured the up- and down-regulation of genes from 10 systems and 61 tissues. Elevations and reductions in gene activation reflect the function (or dysfunction) of cells, tissues, and organ systems. With that said, SRC treatment was shown to rejuvenate over 50% of the tissues examined, with maximal rejuvenation achieved in areas like the hippocampus (the memory consolidation center of the brain), fallopian tubes, and colon. In contrast, the regular stem cells rejuvenated about 30% of the tissues examined.</p>

Treatment with wild-type stem cells (WTC) rescued 31.15% of genes, while SRCs rescued 54.10% of genes altered by aging.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Confirming some of the rejuvenating effects inferred by the gene experiments, the researchers also observed structural changes to various organs and tissues from aged monkeys treated with SRCs. For example, the vascularity of the lung and heart was improved while the thickening of the aorta was reduced. Neurons had longer projections and fewer proteins associated with Alzheimer’s disease (e.g., beta-amyloid and phosphorylated-tau), and the kidney and brain showed less mineralization [abnormal mineral (usually calcium) deposits].&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2>SRCs Reduce Cellular Senescence and Inflammation</h2>



<p>Modern scientists have begun to unravel the underlying causes of aging by identifying commonalities between age-related diseases at the cellular level. Two of the most prominent purported underlying causes of aging are chronic inflammation and <a href="https://www.nad.com/news/what-are-senescent-cells-and-how-do-they-drive-aging">senescent cells</a>. With age, senescent cells accumulate throughout the body, promoting inflammation by secreting pro-inflammatory molecules.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eliminating senescent cells, which can be achieved through genetic manipulation or compounds called senolytics, ameliorates age-related diseases and even extends the lifespan of model organisms. Now, the Academy researchers demonstrate that SRCs reduce senescent cells, measured using a blue dye called SA-β-Gal, in multiple organs, including the brain, heart, and lungs. Along those lines, SRC treatment also reduced markers of inflammation and other underlying causes of aging, like DNA damage.&nbsp;</p>

In the lung and brain, the number of senescent cells in aged monkeys treated with SRCs (green) was similar to that of young monkeys (pink). Moreover, compared to saline-treated aged monkeys (black), wild-type stem cell-treated aged monkeys (blue) exhibited less senescence in the lungs but not the brain, suggesting normal stem cells affect the lung but not the brain.</figcaption></figure></div>


<h2>Stem Cells Make Sense&nbsp;</h2>



<p>When it comes to combating degenerative aging, it makes sense that regenerative stem cells are a promising solution. In fact, one of the <a href="https://www.nad.com/news/hallmarks-of-aging-reversed-therapy">underlying causes of aging</a> is stem cell exhaustion, whereby stem cells lose their regenerative capacity. While normal stem cells have anti-aging effects, as shown by the Chinese Academy of Sciences researchers, they are not protected against stressors like age-related inflammation. This explains why SRCs provide enhanced regenerative capacity (they withstand the harsh microenvironments induced by aging and cellular senescence).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As no serious safety concerns were raised during the study, it would seem that SRCs are well tolerated. However, the long-term effects of the SRC treatment will need further evaluation. The primary concern with injecting stem cells into the bloodstream is that they can trigger the spread of cancer almost anywhere in the body. Nevertheless, the SRCs possess tumor suppression properties, suggesting they may not induce tumor growth. If this ends up being true, we may soon see SRCs being tested in humans.&nbsp;</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><span>TL;DR:</span><span> We tried OKRs, they created more ceremony than clarity. Our solution: Problem Driven Development, a 4-day quarterly process focused on identifying problems (not solutions), prioritizing as a team, and committing publicly. It's kept us shipping at velocity even as we've scaled to 1.7M+ users.</span></p><p><span>For most of my friends and colleagues at mature software companies, there are usually three ways for an item of work to get put on the board to eventually be done.</span></p><ol><li><span>There is a giant ceremony that determines what gets done by a grab bag of metrics.</span></li><li><span>A deal gets blocked by a missing feature, and the engineering team scrambles jets to eliminate the blocker.</span></li><li><span>Founder feels like we have to build something.</span></li></ol><p><span>Thats not to say that every company is a disorganized mess or a bureaucratic hell scape but, I have never met any engineer who said: “Wow, I just love my company planning process.” </span></p><p><span>These words are seldom spoken in the english language. </span></p><p><span>Railway, was fast approaching 1. and 2. at the same time. </span></p><p><span>Despite us using excellent tools (shoutout Linear) planning is much as a cultural phenomena as well as an interesting engineering problem. From our perspective, we would finalize the features and the requirements what we would want to build once every 3 months and then at times get blindsided every now and then from a new business priority or an incident. Especially now serving 1.7M+ customers, we have to aggregate our taste, feedback, and opportunities and make a roadmap that will get us everything we ever wanted.</span></p><p><span>This was an issue.</span></p><p><span>Why write about something that you would read in Rand’s? It’s Q4 for those who celebrate, and we felt that reigniting the agile vs. waterfall armistice needed to be torn up. (Besides, we’re blogging like it’s 2005.)</span></p><p><span>…and we have spent the better part of 18 months to improve our planning so that we finally get to a process that is not bad, and if you’d like, you can steal it, so that you can deliver excellent products.</span></p><p><a href="https://blog.railway.com/p/product-planning-improvement#why-is-most-planning-bad,-you-say"><h2><span>Why is most planning bad, you say?</span></h2></a></p><p><span>Mike Tyson asked about his fight plan against Evander Holyfield responded with; “Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.”</span></p><p><span>And that quote ever since would be used out of context to fight the implementation of Objectives, Key Results across the world. At Railway, we aren’t Anti-Planning, we are Anti-Bad-Planning and as such, we used to avoid a lot of it because we always felt that a bad process is massively negative to the status quo. However, we did get to the point where we needed to finally harness the collective attention spans of the company and work towards a goal.</span></p><p><span>Railway at the time was (and is) a vision led company. We fundamentally believe that most infrastructure boilerplate shouldn’t exist so that you can work on what matters. Back in ‘21, we went from a world where we could do our work in weeks, to work that required us to think in months. I implemented a somewhat lighter form of SAFE which splits work between “sprints”, which were short pieces of work, then initiatives which helped grouped “epics” which are long running work-streams to deliver a feature. </span></p><p><span>Despite us having a strong founder, we still wanted the ability to have employees bring projects that they would be excited to work on. </span></p><p><span>As with most young companies, we found quickly that new work would come in and unseat the old work and we would begin anew. </span></p><p><span>So then we turned to OKRs.</span></p><p><span>We thought that having some long term objectives will help us focus the company.</span></p><p><span>We implemented them faithfully, we all read the John Doer book. …and it worked… somewhat. </span></p><p><a href="https://blog.railway.com/p/product-planning-improvement#okrs-and-software;-water-and-vinegar"><h2><span>OKRs and software; water and vinegar</span></h2></a></p><p><span>We can make this a whole blog post on OKRs. But, trying to hold back here from just ranting and to give you the relevant information. </span></p><p><span>OKRs work REALLY well when you have concrete goals and really simple ways to measure them. Its why they belong at their primary birthplace, the factory. Objectives work when you have something binary or “limited”, like a product existing… or not. Or a product meeting a benchmark… or not. It’s easy to rally a team around them and conquer the world. </span></p><p><span>Where OKRs start to falter, are when you need to use them to prioritize work to meet a “unlimited” objective. Like: “Increase conversion rate of landing page”</span></p><p><span>OKRheads will notice that’s a particularly weak objective, however, teaching an entire organization to all of a sudden be great goal setters, which is what OKRs require you to do made it difficult for engineers to 1) bring them and then 2) plan work around them. Which leads to the first big issue of OKRs- which is that it really depends on the human psychology of the team. Engineers straddle the line between concrete numbers such as uptime, and more creative endeavors such as figuring out how to get a feature implemented right. Whenever the work enters the creative realm, the wheels come off.</span></p><p><span>Which is why outside of the factory, OKRs are great for Sales. You set a number, you get alignment on hitting that number, and then you pick up the phone, email, or LinkedIn until you hit it. The psychology of an account executive matches the planning process.</span></p><p><span>Where OKRs work great, is for alignment. If you are able to set great goals and if you wanted to prescribe a bunch of work toward said goal. …and most startups reach for the High Output Management book (which I love) because there is the lack of alignment between different orgs at a startup. Which is to say, I don’t shame any company reaching for them, the same way newborns have the palmar grasp reflex. We yearn for the alignment.</span></p><p><span>The second big issue for OKRs is that they are, by design, inflexible, once you commit to them. If you spend a week or two planning for them for the year or quarter, and you are midway through realizing that the “KR” part is incorrect, thats a one way door. </span></p><p><span>So we felt pressure into making sure that the OKRs were indeed correct. Which is where you enter the issues of the performative aspects of planning. It felt “mature” for Railway to be having these discussions, even though… it wasn’t productive.</span></p><p><span>At Railway, we would spend a significant amount of time discussing what is a valid OKR, only for us to realize we were two days into the planning process and we’ve yet to decide what we should build for the OKR. </span></p><p><span>This is when Christian, our Head of Operations had an answer for us.</span></p><p><a href="https://blog.railway.com/p/product-planning-improvement#good-ole-projects"><h2><span>Good Ole Projects</span></h2></a></p><p><span>Instead of crowd sourcing the OKRs from the company and bubbling them up per function Jake and Christian would work on some top level guidance that would provide a macro view of our finances, priorities, and strategy that we have to keep in mind. </span></p><p><span>We then have a Hex dashboard with topline metrics from different sides of the product and business. From a GTM perspective, it’s engagement, signups, and revenue. From an Engineering perspective, it’s support tickets, uptime, and feature performance. </span></p><p><span>This data would give us a “theme”. (You may have seen them in our launch weeks.)</span></p><p><span>Whenever someone goes on Central Station and requests a feature, depending on how large the work is, that usually determines if that request becomes a “Project”. </span></p><p><span>Then around the start of 2024, Christian spun up a Notion DB, and punched in a simple template for each new entry.</span></p><div><p><img alt=""

Product Engineering which delivers features and value to our customers via the UI and terminal. Platform which supports the product with the Infrastructure and the APIs to control that Infrastructure. Then Logistics, which is a synthetic team which includes the Support, Marketing, and Sales function working to be the voice of the customer. </span></p><p><span>We would then fill out a “Project Candidate” and then go to bat on trying to figure out if was a priority that tied to the “theme” that was presented. </span></p><p><span>If something is a P0: it’s an existential company risk, we MUST deliver it.</span></p><p><span>Then, a P1: something we need to deliver for this quarter</span></p><p><span>Lastly, P2: a nice to have.</span></p><p><span>This worked well until some cracks formed.</span></p><p><a href="https://blog.railway.com/p/product-planning-improvement#99-problems"><h2><span>99 Problems</span></h2></a></p><p><span>At the start of this new process, our team was small enough to list maybe 50 project candidates, discuss as a group and then be on with it but with 200. Spending all day on a call with your co-workers to discuss if something was worth it isn’t the best use of time. </span></p><p><span>Second, Project Candidates would sometimes have full on fleshed out RFC style sections where the author would have a solution ready to go. When a candidate got deprioritized, it’s understandable why someone would feel not great about their hard effort not being reciprocated. </span></p><p><span>Third, to deal with the larger amount of project candidates and additional sources of project candidates, we would set up additional meetings before the planning week that would eat into our engineering cycles. Not that we want to squeeze every engineer for what they are worth, but these negotiation calls would take longer than the main call sometimes. Worse even, was that we would completely reset the board quarter after quarter. </span></p><p><span>Lastly, which was starting to be a bigger issue, was that having Project Candidates being a bottom up process was great when the people who knew that work they needed to do can fit the whole work-stream in their head. But… we were about to embark on a multi-quarter effort that would span all parts of the business to deliver Railway Metal. This system was not great for uncovering planning gaps that required attention from a different team.</span></p><p><span>(With that said, we did ship some really good software thanks to this planning process.)</span></p><p><span>However, Jake, the team, aren’t ones to sit on their laurels so we refined it until we have our current process. </span></p><p><a href="https://blog.railway.com/p/product-planning-improvement#%E2%80%A6and-a-process-ain%E2%80%99t-one."><h2><span>…and a process ain’t one.</span></h2></a></p><p><span>So we flipped the project system on it’s head. </span></p><p><span>Instead, we practice what I call: “Problem Driven Development”</span></p><p><span>Rather than spending a loaded amount of time picking feedback items from our feedback systems, and spending a loaded amount of time on trying to flesh out requirements. We collect problems on a continuous process that begins in earnest on the Friday before our planning week.</span></p><p><span>We stopped asking people to propose solutions and started asking them to articulate problems. </span><span>No more half-baked RFCs that people felt attached to. No more solution-first thinking that locked us into approaches before we understood what we were solving. Just clear problem statements.</span></p><p><span>Here's what a problem looks like in our system:</span></p><p><span>Problem Title:</span><span> "Users can't debug failed deployments without SSHing into containers"</span></p><p><span>Notice what's missing? Any mention of </span><span>how</span><span> we'd solve it. That comes later, after we've committed to solving the problem. Then we turned the two week ceremony into a lightning 4 day sprint.</span></p><p><a href="https://blog.railway.com/p/product-planning-improvement#the-four-day-process"><h2><span>The Four-Day Process</span></h2></a></p><p><span>After the problems are listed and filled out fully, each team on </span><span>Day 1</span><span> enters problems on their own. If a problem isn't fleshed out, it's put in the Parking Lot and we kindly nudge the idea person to fill the template.</span></p><p><span>By the time we get into a room together, everyone's had time to process what's on the board.</span></p><p><span>Then on </span><span>Day 2,</span><span> the planning captain will have a closed session with the team (with spectators from other teams) to put a best guess priority from P0, P1, and P2. If we find that a problem is contentious or requires an external dependency, we mark it so the day after, we can discuss it.</span></p><p><span>By having each team prioritize independently first, we avoid the tragedy of the commons where everything becomes P0 because someone shouted loudest on the call. Platform can look at their problems and say "yes, API reliability is more important than API versioning right now" without having to negotiate with Product in real-time.</span></p><p><span>(We have spent countless hours talking about difficult questions on a call when we have been able to diffuse rough conversations ahead of time.)</span></p><p><span>On </span><span>Day 3</span><span>, we get to a 95 percent certainty on the priorities listed and tie break the dependencies. We also confirm that we have the capacity and staffing to deal with the problems listed on the board. If not, we add a problem for hiring for a specific role.</span></p><p><span>This is where cross-team dependencies surface naturally. When Platform marks "Multi-mount volumes" as P1 and Product marks "HA DBs" as P1, we can see that one blocks the other. We're not discovering this mid-quarter when someone's already three weeks into building the wrong thing.</span></p><p><span>The capacity check is crucial too. We look at people's current commitments, oncall rotations, and whether anyone's about to take parental leave. If we have eight P1 problems and capacity for five, we have an honest conversation about what drops to P2 or what we need to hire for.</span></p><p><span>Then lastly, </span><span>Day 4</span><span>, commitment. Everyone looks at the whole list, mention final objections if we should be working on something that we aren't— or vice versa. After we confirm priorities, we assign problems to people by giving them a DRI (Directly Responsible Individual).</span></p><p><span>Then, we look into each other's eyes, as much as anyone can on a video call, and commit.</span></p><p><span>After the starting gun is off, we then write RFCs on problems to see how we can best solve them which eventually become Linear tickets.</span></p><p><a href="https://blog.railway.com/p/product-planning-improvement#steal-this-process"><h2><span>Steal This Process</span></h2></a></p><p><span>We're working on open-sourcing our Notion templates because honestly, this isn't rocket science. It's just:</span></p><ol><li><span>Cataloguing your problems, not solutions</span></li><li><span>Let teams prioritize independently before negotiating</span></li><li><span>Front-load the hard conversations</span></li><li><span>Commit publicly</span></li><li><span>Then, </span><span>and only then</span><span>, figure out how to solve it</span></li></ol><p><span>But the real hard part was building a culture where people feel safe bringing up problems without having to defend their pet solutions.</span></p><p><span>Keep process to a minimum, focus on performance of shipping, not performative work.</span></p><p><span>And like any good product, our planning process will keep evolving. Maybe in six months we'll realize Problem Driven Development has its own cracks. </span><span>Theres always plenty to do on planning and I think we generally know how it’ll need to evolve, but we try to take small steps from cycle to cycle.  </span><span> If that happens, we'll write another blog post about what we learned and what we changed.</span></p><p><span>Until then, we're shipping.</span></p></section></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>
Every time I look at someone’s simple static site generation setup for their
blog, I feel a pang of envy. I’m sure I could make a decent blogging engine in
2,000 lines of code, and it would be something I’d understand, be proud over,
able to extend, and willing to share with others.
</p>

<p>
Instead, I write these articles in Org mode, and use mostly the standard Org
publishing functions to export them to <abbr>html</abbr>. This is <a href="https://entropicthoughts.com/long-hiatus-emacs-upgrades.html">sometimes brittle</a>, but
most annoyingly, I don’t understand it. I have been asked for details on how my
publishing flow works, but the truth is I have no idea what happens when I run
the <code>org-publish-current-file</code> command.
</p>

<p>
I could find out by tracing the evaluation of the Lisp code that runs on export,
but I won’t, because just the <abbr>html</abbr> exporting code (<code>ox-html.el</code>) is 5,000
lines of complexity. The general exporting framework (<code>ox-publish.el</code> and
<code>ox.el</code>) is 8,000 lines. The framework depends on Org parsing code
(<code>org-element.el</code>) which is at least another 9,000 lines. This is over 20,000
lines of complexity I’d need to contend with.
</p>

<p>
It might seem like a no-brainer to just write that 2,000 line custom static
generator and use that instead.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
Except one thing: Babel.
</p>

<p>
Any lightweight markup format (like Markdown or ReStructuredText or whatever)
allows for embedding code blocks, but Org, through Babel, can <i>run</i> that code on
export, and then display the output in the published document, <i>even when the
output is a table or an image</i>. It supports sessions that lets code reuse
definitions from earlier code blocks. It allows for injecting variables from the
markup into the code, and vice versa. As a bonus, Org doesn’t require a
JavaScript syntax highlighter, because it generates inline styles in the source
code.
</p>

<p>
It does this for a large number of languages, although I mainly use it with R
for drawing plots. Being able to do this is incredibly convenient, because it
makes it trivial to <a href="https://entropicthoughts.com/intention-to-treat-experiments.html">draft data, illustrations, and text at the same time</a>,
adjusting both until the article coheres. Having tried it, I cannot see myself
living without it.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
A simple 2,000 line blogging engine would be a fun weekend project. Mirroring
the features of Babel I use would turn it into a multi-month endeavour for
someone with limited time such as myself. Not going to happen, and I will
continue to beat myself up for overcomplicating my publishing workflow.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/blog/not-written-with-ai/">https://www.fastmail.com/blog/not-written-with-ai/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45453135">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-pagefind-body="" data-cms-edit="content"> <p>It’s all the rage right now. Everyone is scrambling to put AI into their products. The uncanny valley is shrinking enough that it’s hard to see how much AI was used to write something.</p> <p>This isn’t entirely new, auto-complete on my phone already suggests the most likely word when I’m typing. AI writing tools are an extension of this, but they’re also much more capable.</p> <h2 id="your-electronic-memory" tabindex="-1">Your electronic memory</h2> <p>I stand by one of the most important truths about email. It’s not only the largest and most diverse social network, <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/blog/email-is-your-electronic-memory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">email is your electronic memory</a>.</p> <p>In the novel 1984, the “Ministry of Truth” has a whole massive department which rewrites history. In a world where there’s enough AI capability to process the entire web and rewrite every page to remove something, the cost of “changing history” is much reduced, so we can expect more of it.</p> <p>This is where the immutability of email really shines. An email is your copy, and the sender can’t revise it later. This is frustrating when you’ve sent the wrong thing and have to send a separate correction later, but in the long term it’s insanely valuable.</p> <p>It makes a huge difference to be able to go back and double-check your memory against an email you saw years ago and know that if they disagree, the email is correct. This is already not the case with web pages — they change, and it’s only becoming worse.</p> <h2 id="adapting-to-a-changing-world" tabindex="-1">Adapting to a changing world</h2> <p>My son is studying at University now, and he’s one of a few students in his class who refuses to use AI to write his assignments. As he said “what’s the point of paying to be here if I’m not going to build the knowledge and skills for myself, and come out knowing how to do the thing” (near enough… I didn’t write the exact words down in an email, so I’m going off my own fallible memory!) I am so proud of him for having that attitude.</p> <p>I’m also pleased to see that Fastmail’s staff, and many of our customers, are wary of AI tools.</p> <p>But they are that, tools. The world is changing, and we need to adapt and understand it.</p> <h2 id="our-service-your-data" tabindex="-1">Our service, your data</h2> <p>For our service, we want you to be able to do what you desire with your own email, calendars, and contacts. We will continue to build tools and integrations to make that easier.</p> <p>You are welcome to operate your Fastmail account with AI tools, so long as that usage doesn’t otherwise breach our <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/policies/terms-of-service/">Terms of Service</a>, or degrade the performance of our systems for other customers.</p> <h2 id="our-staff-your-privacy" tabindex="-1">Our staff, your privacy</h2> <p>For our staff, we encourage understanding the tools that exist in the world, and how to use them safely. Our policy makes it clear that any use of tools, including tools with AI in them, must follow clear privacy-preserving principles:</p> <ul> <li>Data Protection: All data protection, confidentiality, and privacy policies must be followed (our vendors for things like anti-abuse and support are moving towards using AI for translation, categorization, abuse detection – and we are ensuring that their policies continue to provide protection for our customers)</li> <li>Accountability for work: Any AI generated writing or code must be reviewed and understood by a human being, and go through our regular second-set-of-eyes processes before being used</li> <li>Bias awareness: Actively look for biases or hallucinations in AI output</li> <li>Human authority: Always have a path for appeal to a human from any decision that is made by automated tools</li> </ul> <h2 id="the-future" tabindex="-1">The future</h2> <p>Who knows what the future will bring, but we continue to be guided by the principles that we first <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/blog/fastmails-values/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">publicly articulated in 2016</a> and have held even longer. The data is yours, and we will be good stewards and good internet citizens, helping enable you to use your data in the ways you choose.</p> </div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <div itemprop="articleBody">
          
          
          
<p>This blog used to run using with a stack based on <a href="https://racket-lang.org/">Racket</a> using <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/pollen/">Pollen</a> and <a href="https://andregarzia.com/2022/05/How-this-blog-works-or-embracing-chaos.html">lots of hacks on top of it</a>. At some point I realised that my setup was working against me. The moving parts and workflow I created added too much friction to keep my blog active. That happened mostly because it was a static generator trying to behave as if it was dynamic website with an editing interface. That can be done really well — cue <a href="https://getgrav.org/">Grav CMS</a> — but that was not the case for me.</p>
<p>Once I decided to rewrite this blog as a simpler system, I faced the dilema of what stack to choose. The obvious choice for me would be Javascript, it is the language I use more often and one that I am quite confortable with. Still, I don't think it is a wise choice for the kind of blog I want to maintain.</p>
<p>Talking to some friends recently, I noticed that many people I know that have implemented their own blogging systems face many challenges keeping them running over many years. Not because it is hard to keep software running, but because their stack of choice is moving faster than their codebase.</p>
<p>This problem is specially prevalent in the Javascript world. It is almost a crime that JS as understood by the browser is this beautiful language with extreme retrocompatibility, while JS as understood and used by the current tooling and workflows is this mess moving at lightspeed. Let me unpack that for a bit.</p>
<p>You can open a web page from 1995 on your browser of choice and it will just work because browser vendors try really hard to make sure they don't break the web.</p>
<p>Developers who built the whole ecosystem of NodeJS, NPM, and all those libraries and frameworks don't share the same ethos. They all make a big case of semantic versioning and thus being able to handle breaking changes, but they have breaking changes all the time. You'd be hardpressed to actually run some JS code from ten years ago based on NodeJS and NPM. There is a big chance that dependencies might be gone, broken, or it might be incompatible with the current NodeJS.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I know this sounds like FUD, and that for many many projects, maybe even most projects, that will not be the case. But I heard from many people that keeping their blogging systems up to date requires a lot more work than they would like to do and if they don't, then they're screwed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is also true about other languages even though many of them move at a slower speed. A friend recently complained about a blogging system he implemented that requires Ruby 2.0 and that keeping that running sucks.</p>
<p>I want a simpler blogging system; one that requires minimal changes over time.</p>
<h3>Now we talk about Lua</h3>
<p><a href="https://lua.org/">Lua</a> is a wonderful and nimble language that is <a href="https://andregarzia.com/2021/01/lua-a-misunderstood-language.html">often misunderstood</a>.</p>
<p>One characteristic that I love about it, is that is evolves very slowly. Lua 5.1 was introduced in 2006, Lua 5.4 which is the current version initial release was in 2020. Yes, there are point released in between, but you can see how much slower it moves when compared to JS.</p>
<p>The differences between Lua 5.1 and Lua 5.4 are minimal when compared with how much other languages changed in the same time period.</p>
<p>Lua only requires a C89 compiler to bootstrap itself. It is very easy to make Lua work and even easier to make it interface with something.</p>
<p>JS is a lot larger than Lua, there is more to understand and more to remember. My blog needs are very simple and Lua can handle them with ease.</p>
<h2>How this blog works</h2>
<p>This is an old-school blog. I uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface">cgi-bin</a> — aka Comon Gateway Interface — scripts to run it. It is a dynamic website with a <a href="https://sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> database holding its data. When you open a page, it fetches the data from a database and assembles a HTML to send to the browser using <a href="https://luarocks.org/modules/olivine-labs/lustache">Mustache</a> templates.</p>
<p>One process per request. Like the old days.</p>
<p>You might argue that if I went with NodeJS, I'd be able to serve more requests using fewer resources. That is true. I don't need to serve that many requests though. My peak access was a couple years ago with 50k visitors on a week, even my old Racket blog could handle that fine. The Lua one should handle it too; and if it breaks it breaks. I'm a flawed human being, my code can be flawed too, we're in this together, holding hands.</p>
<p>Your blog is your place to experiment and program how you want it. You can drop the JS fatigue, you can drop your fancy Haskell types, you can just do whatever you find fun and keep going (and that includes JS and Haskell if that's your thing. You do you).</p>
<p>Cause I'm using Lua, I don't have as many libraries and frameworks available to me as JS people have, but I still have quite a large collection via <a href="https://luarocks.org/">Luarocks</a>. I try not to add many dependencies to my blog. At the moment there are about ten and that is mostly because Lua is a batteries-not-included language so you start from a minimal core and build things up to suit your needs.</p>
<p>For a lot of things I went with the questionable choice of implementing things myself. I got my own little CGI library. It is 200 lines long and does the bare minimum to make this blog work. I got my own little libraries for many things. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/">Micropub</a> and <a href="https://indieauth.net/">IndieAuth</a> were all implemented by hand.</p>
<p>At the moment I'm <strike>despairing</strike> <strike>frustrated</strike> having a lot of fun implementing <a href="https://indieweb.org/Webmention">WebMentions</a>. Doing the <a href="https://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2">Microformats2</a> <strike>exorcism</strike> extraction on my own is teaching me a lot of things.</p>
<p>What I want to say is that by choosing a small language that moves very slowly and very few dependencies, I can keep all of my blogging system in my head. I can make sure it will run without too much change for the next ten or twenty years.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lua is a lego set, a toolkit, it adapts to you and your needs. I don't need to keep chasing the new shiny or the latest framework du jour. I can focus on making the features I want and actually understanding how they work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead of installing a single dependency in another language and it pulling a hundred of other small dependencies all of which were transpiled into something the engine understands to the point that understanding how all the pieces work and fit together takes more time than to learn a new language, I decided to keep things simple.</p>
<p>I got 29 Luarocks installed here and that is for all my Lua projects in this machine. That is my blog, my game development, my own work scripts for my day job. Not even half of those are for my blog.</p>
<p>I often see wisdom in websites such as Hacker News and Lobsters around the idea of "choosing boring" because it is proven, safe, easier to maintain. I think that boring is not necessarily applicable to my case. I don't find Lua boring at all, but all that those blog posts talk about that kind of mindset are all applicable to my own choices here.</p>
<p>Next time you're building your own blogging software, consider for a bit for how long do you want to maintain it. I first started blogging on macOS 8 in 2001. I choose badly many times and in the end couldn't keep my content moving forward in time with me as softwares I used or created became impossible to run. The last two changes: from JS to Racket and from Racket to Lua have been a lot safer and I managed to carry all my content forward into increasingly simpler setups and workflows.</p>
<p>My blogging system is not becoming more complex over the years, it is becoming smaller, because with each change I select a stack that is more nimble and smaller than the one I had before. I don't think I can go smaller than Lua though.</p>
<p>By small I mean:</p>
<ul>
<li>A language I can fully understand and keep on my head.</li>
<li>A language that I know how to build the engine and can do it if needed.</li>
<li>An engine that requires very few resources and is easy to interface with third-party libraries in native code.</li>
</ul>
<p>I chose Lua because of all that, and I'm happy with it and hope this engine will see me through the next ten or so years.</p>

            <pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 16:06:10 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://signal.org/blog/spqr/">https://signal.org/blog/spqr/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45451527">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://signal.org/blog/images/spqr-header.png" alt="A stylized Signal logo inscribed with mathematical symbols representing a qubit."></p><p>We are excited to announce a significant advancement in the security of the Signal Protocol: the introduction of the Sparse Post Quantum Ratchet (SPQR). This new ratchet enhances the Signal Protocol’s resilience against future quantum computing threats while maintaining our existing security guarantees of forward secrecy and post-compromise security.</p><p>The Signal Protocol is a set of cryptographic specifications that provides end-to-end encryption for private communications exchanged daily by billions of people around the world. After its publication in 2013, the open source Signal Protocol was adopted not only by the Signal application but also by other major messaging products. Technical information on the Signal Protocol can be found in the specifications section of our <a href="https://signal.org/docs/">docs</a> site.</p><p>In a <a href="https://signal.org/blog/pqxdh/">previous blog post</a>, we announced the first step towards advancing quantum resistance for the Signal Protocol: an upgrade called PQXDH that incorporates quantum-resistent cryptographic secrets when chat sessions are established in order to protect against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_now%2C_decrypt_later">harvest-now-decrypt-later</a> attacks that could allow current chat sessions to become compromised if a sufficiently powerful quantum computer is developed in the future. However, the Signal Protocol isn’t just about protecting cryptographic material and keys at the beginning of a new chat or phone call; it’s also designed to minimize damage and heal from compromise as that conversation continues.</p><p>We refer to these security goals as Forward Secrecy (FS) and Post-Compromise Security (PCS). FS and PCS can be considered mirrors of each other: FS protects past messages against future compromise, while PCS protects future messages from past compromise. Today, we are happy to announce the next step in advancing quantum resistance for the Signal Protocol: an additional regularly advancing post-quantum ratchet called the Sparse Post Quantum Ratchet, or SPQR. On its own, SPQR provides secure messaging that provably achieves these FS and PCS guarantees in a quantum safe manner. We mix the output of this new ratcheting protocol with Signal’s existing Double Ratchet, in a combination we refer to as the Triple Ratchet.</p><p>What does this mean for you as a Signal user? First, when it comes to your experience using the app, nothing changes. Second, because of how we’re rolling this out and mixing it in with our existing encryption, eventually all of your conversations will move to this new protocol without you needing to take any action. Third, and most importantly, this protects your communications both now and in the event that cryptographically relevant quantum computers eventually become a reality, and it allows us to maintain our existing security guarantees of forward secrecy and post-compromise security as we proactively prepare for that new world.</p><h2 id="the-current-state-of-the-signal-protocol">The Current State of the Signal Protocol</h2><p>The original Signal ratchet uses hash functions for FS and a set of elliptic-curve Diffie Hellman (ECDH) secret exchanges for PCS. The hash functions are quantum safe, but elliptic-curve cryptography is not. An example is in order: our favorite users, Alice and Bob, establish a long-term connection and chat over it regularly. During that session’s lifetime, Alice and Bob regularly agree on new ECDH secrets and use them to “ratchet” their session. Mean ol’ Mallory records the entire (encrypted) communication, and really wants to know what Alice and Bob are talking about.</p><p>The concept of a “ratchet” is crucial to our current non-quantum FS/PCS protection. In the physical world, a ratchet is a mechanism that allows a gear to rotate forward, but disallows rotation backwards. In the Signal Protocol, it takes on a similar role. When Alice and Bob “ratchet” their session, they replace the set of keys they were using prior with a new set based on both the older secrets and a new one they agree upon. Given access to those new secrets, though, there’s no (non-quantum) way to compute the older secrets. By being “one-way”, this ratcheting mechanism provides FS.</p><p>The ECDH mechanism allows Alice and Bob to generate new, small (32 bytes) data blobs and attach them to every message. Whenever each party receives a message from the other, they can locally (and relatively cheaply) use this data blob to agree on a new shared secret, then use that secret to ratchet their side of the protocol. Crucially, ECDH also allows Alice and Bob to both agree on the new secret without sending that secret itself over their session, and in fact without sending anything over the session that Mallory could use to determine it. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange">This description of Diffie-Hellman key exchange</a> provides more details on the concepts of such a key exchange, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman">this description of ECDH</a> provides specific details on the variant used by the current Signal protocol.</p><p>Sometime midway through the lifetime of Alice and Bob’s session, Mallory successfully breaches the defences of both Alice and Bob, gaining access to all of the (current) secrets used for their session at the time of request. Alice and Bob should have the benefits of Forward Secrecy - they’ve ratcheted sometime recently before the compromise, so no messages earlier than their last ratchet are accessible to Mallory, since ratcheting isn’t reversible. They also retain the benefits of Post-Compromise Security. Their ratcheting after Mallory’s secret access agrees upon new keys that can’t be gleaned just from the captured data they pass between each other, re-securing the session.</p><p>Should Mallory have access to a quantum computer, though, things aren’t so simple. Because elliptic curve cryptography is not quantum resistant, it’s possible that Mallory could glean access to the secret that Alice and Bob agreed upon, just by looking at the communication between them. Given this, Alice and Bob’s session will never “heal”; Mallory’s access to their network traffic from this point forward will allow her to decrypt all future communications.</p><h2 id="mixing-in-quantum-security">Mixing In Quantum Security</h2><p>In order to make our security guarantees stand up to quantum attacks, we need to mix in secrets generated from quantum secure algorithms. In PQXDH, we did this by performing an additional round of key agreement during the session-initiating handshake, then mixing the resulting shared secret into the initial secret material used to create Signal sessions. To handle FS and PCS, we need to do continuous key agreement, where over the lifetime of a session we keep generating new shared secrets and mixing those keys into our encryption keys.</p><p>Luckily there is a tool designed exactly for this purpose: the quantum-secure Key-Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM). KEMs share similar behavior to the Diffie-Hellman mechanisms we described earlier, where two clients provide each other with information, eventually deciding on a shared secret, without anyone who intercepts their communications being able to access that secret. However, there is one important distinction for KEMs - they require ordered, asymmetric messages to be passed between their clients. In ECDH, both clients send the other some public parameters, and both combine these parameters with their locally held secrets and come up with an identical shared secret. In the <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/203/final">standardized</a> ML-KEM key-encapsulation mechanism, though, the initiating client generates a pair of encapsulation key (EK) and decapsulation key (DK) (analogous to a public and private key respectively) and sends the EK. The receiving client receives it, generates a secret, and wraps it into a ciphertext (CT) with that key. The initiating client receives that CT and decapsulates with its previously generated DK. In the end, both clients have access to the new, shared secret, just through slightly different means.</p><p>Wanting to integrate this quantum-secure key sharing into Signal, we could take a simple, naive approach for each session. When Alice initiates a session with Bob,</p><ul><li>Alice, with every message she sends, sends an EK</li><li>Bob, with every message he receives, generates a secret and a CT, and sends the CT back</li><li>Alice, on receiving a CT, extracts the secret with her DK and mixes it in</li></ul><p>This initially simple-looking approach, though, quickly runs into a number of issues we’ll need to address to make our protocol actually robust. First, encapsulation keys and CTs are large - over 1000 bytes each for ML-KEM 768, compared to the 32 bytes required for ECDH. Second, while this protocol works well when both clients are online, what happens when a client is offline? Or a message is dropped or reordered? Or Alice wants to send 10 messages before Bob wants to send one?</p><p>Some of these problems have well-understood solutions, but others have trade-offs that may shine in certain circumstances but fall short in others. Let’s dive in and come to some conclusions.</p><h2 id="who-wants-what-when">Who Wants What When</h2><p>How does Alice decide what to send based on what Bob needs next, and vice versa? If Bob hasn’t received an EK yet, she shouldn’t send the next one. What does Bob send when he hasn’t yet received an EK from Alice, or when he has, but he’s already responded to it? This is a common problem when remote parties send messages to communicate, so there’s a good, well-understood solution: a state machine. Alice and Bob both keep track of “what state am I in”, and base their decisions on that. When sending or receiving a message, they might also change their state. For example:</p><ul><li>Alice wants to send a message, but she’s in a StartingA state, so she doesn’t have an EK. So, she generates an EK/DK pair, stores them locally, and transitions to the SendEK state</li><li>Alice wants to send a message and is in the SendEK state. She sends the EK along with the message</li><li>Alice wants to send another message, but she’s still in the SendEK state. So, she sends the EK with the new message as well</li><li>Bob receives the message with the EK. He generates a secret and uses the EK to create a CT. He transitions to the SendingCT state.</li><li>Bob wants to send a message and he’s in the SendingCT state. He sends the CT along with the message</li><li>Bob wants to send a message and he’s in the SendingCT state. He sends the CT along with the message</li><li>… etc …</li></ul><p>By crafting a set of states and transitions, both sides can coordinate what’s sent. Note, though, that even in this simple case, we see problems. For example, we’re sending our (large) EK and (large) CT multiple times.</p><p><img src="https://signal.org/blog/images/spqr-3.png" alt="SPQR State Machine Diagram"></p><h2 id="say-or-send-less">Say (or Send) Less</h2><p>We’ve already mentioned that the size of the data we’re sending has increased pretty drastically, from 32 bytes to over 1000 per message. But bandwidth is expensive, especially on consumer devices like client phones, that may be anywhere in the world and have extremely varied costs for sending bytes over the wire. So let’s discuss strategies for conserving that bandwidth.</p><p>First, the simplest approach - don’t send a new key with every message. Just, for example, send with every 50 messages, or once a week, or every 50 messages unless you haven’t sent a key in a week, or any other combination of options. All of these approaches tend to work pretty well in online cases, where both sides of a session are communicating in real-time with no message loss. But in cases where one side is offline or loss can occur, they can be problematic. Consider the case of “send a key if you haven’t sent one in a week”. If Bob has been offline for 2 weeks, what does Alice do when she wants to send a message? What happens if we can lose messages, and we lose the one in fifty that contains a new key? Or, what happens if there’s an attacker in the middle that wants to stop us from generating new secrets, and can look for messages that are 1000 bytes larger than the others and drop them, only allowing keyless messages through?</p><p>Another method is to chunk up a message. Want to send 1000 bytes? Send 10 chunks of 100 bytes each. Already sent 10 chunks? Resend the first chunk, then the second, etc. This smooths out the total number of bytes sent, keeping individual message sizes small and uniform. And often, loss of messages is handled. If chunk 1 was lost, just wait for it to be resent. But it runs into an issue with message loss - if chunk 99 was lost, the receiver has to wait for all of chunks 1-98 to be resent before it receives the chunk it missed. More importantly, if a malicious middleman wants to stop keys from being decided upon, they could always drop chunk 3, never allowing the full key to pass between the two parties.</p><p>We can get around all of these issues using a concept called erasure codes. Erasure codes work by breaking up a larger message into smaller chunks, then sending those along. Let’s consider our 1000 byte message being sent as 100 byte chunks again. After chunk #10 has been sent, the entirety of the original 1000 byte message has been sent along in cleartext. But rather than just send the first chunk over again, erasure codes build up a new chunk #11, and #12, etc. And they build them in such a way that, once the recipient receives any 10 chunks in any order, they’ll be able to reconstruct the original 1000 byte message.</p><p>When we put this concept of erasure code chunks together with our previous state machine, it gives us a way to send large blocks of data in small chunks, while handling messages that are dropped. Crucially, this includes messages dropped by a malicious middleman: since any N chunks can be used to recreate the original message, a bad actor would need to drop all messages after #N-1 to disallow the data to go through, forcing them into a complete (and highly noticeable) denial of service. Now, if Alice wants to send an EK to Bob, Alice will:</p><ol><li>Transition from the StartingA state to the SendingEK state, by generating a new EK and chunking it</li><li>While in the SendingEK state, send a new chunk of the EK along with any messages she sends</li><li>When she receives confirmation that the recipient has received the EK (when she receives a chunk of CT), transition to the ReceivingCT state</li></ol><p>On Bob’s side, he will:</p><ol><li>Transition from the StartingB state to the ReceivingEK state when he receives its first EK chunk</li><li>Keep receiving EK chunks until he has enough to reconstruct the EK</li><li>At that point, reconstruct the EK, generate the CT, chunk the CT, and transition to the SendingCT state</li><li>From this point on, he will send a chunk of the CT with every message</li></ol><p>One interesting way of looking at this protocol so far is to consider the messages flowing from Alice to Bob as potential capacity for sending data associated with post-quantum ratcheting: each message that we send, we could also send additional data like a chunk of EK or of the CT. If we look at Bob’s side, above, we notice that sometimes he’s using that capacity (IE: in step 4 when he’s sending CT chunks) and sometimes he’s not (if he sends a message to Alice during step 2, he has no additional data to send). This capacity is pretty limited, so using more of it gives us the potential to speed up our protocol and agree on new secrets more frequently.</p><p><img src="https://signal.org/blog/images/spqr-1.png" alt="SPQR Flow Diagram illustrating how bandwidth consumption is optimized"></p><h2 id="a-meditation-on-how-faster-isnt-always-better">A Meditation On How Faster Isn’t Always Better</h2><p>We want to generate shared secrets, then use them to secure messages. So, does that mean that we want to generate shared secrets as fast as possible? Let’s introduce a new term: an epoch. Alice and Bob start their sessions in epoch 0, sending the EKs for epoch 1 (EK#1) and associated ciphertext (CT#1) to each other. Once that process completes, they have a new shared secret they use to enter epoch 1, after which all newly sent messages are protected by the new secret. Each time they generate a new shared secret, they use it to enter a new epoch. Surely, every time we enter a new epoch with a new shared secret, we protect messages before that secret (FS) and after that secret (PCS), so faster generation is better? It seems simple, but there’s an interesting complexity here that deserves attention.</p><p>First, let’s discuss how to do things faster. Right now, there’s a lot of capacity we’re not using: Bob sends nothing while Alice sends an EK, and Alice sends nothing while Bob sends a CT. Speeding this up isn’t actually that hard. Let’s change things so that Alice sends EK#1, and once Bob acknowledges its receipt, Alice immediately generates and sends EK#2. And once she notices Bob has received that, she generates and sends EK#3, etc. Whenever Alice sends a new message, she always has data to send along with it (new EK chunks), so she’s using its full capacity. Bob doesn’t always have a new CT to send, but he is receiving EKs as fast as Alice can send them, so he often has a new CT to send along.</p><p>But now let’s consider what happens when an attacker gains access to Alice. Let’s say that Alice has sent EK#1 and EK#2 to Bob, and she’s in the process of sending EK#3. Bob has acknowledged receipt of EK#1 and EK#2, but he’s still in the process of sending CT#1, since in this case Bob sends fewer messages to Alice than vice versa. Because Alice has already generated 3 EKs she hasn’t used, Alice needs to keep the associated DK#1, DK#2, and DK#3 around. So, if at this point someone maliciously gains control of Alice’s device, they gain access to both the secrets associated with the current epoch (here, epoch 0) and to the DKs necessary to reconstruct the secrets to other epochs (here, epochs 1, 2, and 3) using only the over-the-wire CT that Bob has yet to send. This is a big problem: by generating secrets early, we’ve actually made the in-progress epochs and any messages that will be sent within them less secure against this single-point-in-time breach.</p><p>To test this out, we at Signal built a number of different state machines, each sending different sets of data either in parallel or serially. We then ran these state machines in numerous simulations, varying things like the ratio of messages sent by Alice vs Bob, the amount of data loss or reordering, etc. And while running these simulations, we tracked what epochs’ secrets were exposed at any point in time, assuming an attacker were to breach either Alice’s or Bob’s secret store. The results showed that, in general, while simulations that handled multiple epochs’ secrets in parallel (IE: by sending EK#2 before receipt of CT#1) did generate new epochs more quickly, they actually made more messages vulnerable to a single breach.</p><h2 id="but-lets-still-be-efficient">But Let’s Still Be Efficient</h2><p>This still leaves us with a problem, though: the capacity present in messages we send in either direction is still a precious resource, and we want to use it as efficiently as possible. And our simple approach of Alice’s “send EK, receive CT, repeat” and Bob’s “receive EK, send CT, repeat” leaves lots of time where Alice and Bob have nothing to send, should that capacity be available.</p><p>To improve our use of our sending capacity, we decided to take a harder look into the ML-KEM algorithm we’re using to share secrets, to see if there was room to improve. Let’s break things down more and share some actual specifics on the ML-KEM algorithm.</p><ol><li>Alice generates an EK of 1184 bytes to send to Bob, and an associated DK</li><li>Bob receives the EK</li><li>Bob samples a new shared secret (32 bytes), which he encrypts with EK into a CT of 1088 bytes to send to Alice</li><li>Alice receives the CT, uses the DK to decrypt it, and now also has access to the 32 byte shared secret</li></ol><p>Diving in further, we can break out step #3 into some sub-steps</p><ol><li>Alice generates an EK of 1184 bytes to send to Bob, and an associated DK</li><li>Bob receives the EK</li><li>Bob samples a new shared secret (32 bytes), which he encrypts with EK into a CT of 1088 bytes to send to Alice<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup><ol type="a"><li> Bob creates a new shared secret S and sampled randomness R by sampling entropy and combining it with a hash of EK</li><li>Bob hashes the EK into a Hash</li><li>Bob pulls 32 bytes of the EK, a Seed</li><li>Bob uses the Seed and R to generate the majority of the CT</li><li>Bob then uses S and EK to generate the last portion of the CT</li></ol></li><li>Alice receives the CT, uses the DK to decrypt it, and now also has access to the 32 byte shared secret</li></ol><p>Step 3.d, which generates 960 bytes of the 1088-byte CT, only needs 64 bytes of input: a Seed that’s 32 of EK’s bytes, and the hash of EK, which is an additional 32. If we combine these values and send them first, then most of EK and most of the CT can be sent in parallel from Alice to Bob and Bob to Alice respectively. Our more complicated but more efficient secret sharing now looks like this:</p><ol><li>Alice generates EK and DK. Alice extracts the 32-byte Seed from EK</li><li>Alice sends 64 bytes EK<sub>1</sub> (Seed + Hash(EK)) to Bob. Bob sends nothing during this time.</li><li>Bob receives the Seed and Hash, and generates the first, largest part of the CT from them (CT<sub>1</sub>)</li><li>After this point, Alice sends EK<sub>2</sub> (the rest of the EK minus the Seed), while Bob sends CT<sub>1</sub></li><li>Bob eventually receives EK<sub>2</sub>, and uses it to generate the final portion of the CT (CT<sub>2</sub>)</li><li>Once Alice tells Bob that he has received all of CT<sub>1</sub>, Bob sends Alice CT<sub>2</sub>. Alice sends nothing during this time.</li><li>With both sides having all of the pieces of EK and the CT that they need, they extract their shared secret and increment their epoch</li></ol><p>There are still places in this algorithm (specifically steps 2 and 6) where one side has nothing to send. But during those times, the other side has only a very small amount of information to send, so the duration of those steps is minimal compared to the rest of the process. Specifically, while the full EK is 37 chunks and the full CT is 34, the two pieces of the new protocol which must be sent without data being received (EK<sub>1</sub> and CT<sub>2</sub>) are 2 and 4 chunks respectively, while the pieces that can be sent while also receiving (EK<sub>2</sub> and CT<sub>1</sub>) are the bulk of the data, at 36 and 30 chunks respectively. Far more of our sending capacity is actually used with this approach.</p><p><img src="https://signal.org/blog/images/spqr-2.png" alt="SPQR Flow Diagram showing improved bandwidth efficiency"></p><p>Remember that all of this is just to perform a quantum-safe key exchange that gives us a secret we can mix into the bigger protocol. To help us organize our code, our security proofs, and our understanding better we treat this process as a standalone protocol that we call <a href="https://signal.org/docs/specifications/mlkembraid/">the ML-KEM Braid</a>.</p><p>This work was greatly aided by the authors of the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/libcrux-ml-kem">libcrux-ml-kem</a> Rust library, who graciously exposed the APIs necessary to work with this incremental version of ML-KEM 768. With this approach completed, we’ve been able to really efficiently use the sending capacity of messages sent between two parties to share secrets as quickly as possible without exposing secrets from multiple epochs to potential attackers.</p><h2 id="mixing-things-up---the-triple-ratchet">Mixing Things Up - The Triple Ratchet</h2><p>There are plenty of details to add to make sure that we reached every corner - check those out in our <a href="https://signal.org/docs/">online protocol documentation</a> - but this basic idea lets us build secure messaging that has post-quantum FS and PCS without using up anyone’s data. We’re not done, though! Remember, at the beginning of this post we said we wanted post-quantum security without taking away our existing guarantees.</p><p>While today’s Double Ratchet may not be quantum safe, it provides a high level of security today and we believe it will continue to be strong well into the future. We aren’t going to take that away from our users. So what can we do?</p><p>Our answer ends up being really simple: we run both the Double Ratchet and the Sparse Post Quantum Ratchet alongside each other and mix their keys together, into what we’re calling the Triple Ratchet protocol. When you want to send a message you ask both the Double Ratchet and SPQR “What encryption key should I use for the next message?” and they will both give you a key (along with some other data you need to put in a message header). Instead of either key being used directly, both are passed into a Key Derivation Function - a special function that takes random-enough inputs and produces a secure cryptographic key that’s as long as you need. This gives you a new “mixed” key that has hybrid security. An attacker has to break both our elliptic curve and ML-KEM to even be able to distinguish this key from random bits. We use that mixed key to encrypt our message.</p><p>Receiving messages is just as easy. We take the message header - remember it has some extra data in it - and send it to the Double Ratchet and SPQR and ask them “What key should I use to decrypt a message with this header?” They both return their keys and you feed them both into that Key Derivation Function to get your decryption key. After that, everything proceeds just like it always has.</p><h2 id="heterogeneous-rollout">Heterogeneous Rollout</h2><p>So we’ve got this new, snazzy protocol, and we want to roll it out to all of our users across all of their devices… but none of the devices currently support that protocol. We roll it out to Alice, and Alice tries to talk to Bob, but Alice speaks SPQR and Bob doesn’t. Or we roll it out to Bob, but Alice wants to talk to Bob and Alice doesn’t know the new protocol Bob wants to use. How do we make this work?</p><p>Let’s talk about the simplest option: allowing downgrades. Alice tries to establish a session with Bob using SPQR and sends a message over it. Bob fails to read the message and establish the session, because Bob hasn’t been upgraded yet. Bob sends Alice an error, so Alice has to try again. This sounds fine, but in practice it’s not tenable. Consider what happens if Alice and Bob aren’t online at the same time… Alice sends a message at 1am, then shuts down. Bob starts up at 3am, sends an error, then shuts down. Alice gets that error when she restarts at 5am, then resends. Bob starts up at 7am and finally gets the message he should have received at 3am, 4 hours behind schedule.</p><p>To handle this, we designed the SPQR protocol to allow itself to downgrade to not being used. When Alice sends her first message, she attaches the SPQR data she would need to start up negotiation of the protocol. Noticing that downgrades are allowed for this session, Alice doesn’t mix any SPQR key material into the message yet. Bob ignores that data, because it’s in a location he glosses over, but since there’s no mixed in keys yet, he can still decrypt the message. He sends a response that lacks SPQR data (since he doesn’t yet know how to fill it in), which Alice receives. Alice sees a message without SPQR data, and understands that Bob doesn’t speak SPQR yet. So, she downgrades to not using it for that session, and they happily talk without SPQR protection.</p><p>There’s some scary potential problems here… let’s work through them. First off, can a malicious middleman force a downgrade and disallow Alice and Bob from using SPQR, even if both of them are able to? We protect against that by having the SPQR data attached to the message be MAC’d by the message-wide authentication code - a middleman can’t remove it without altering the whole message in such a way that the other party sees it, even if that other party doesn’t speak SPQR. Second, could some error cause messages to accidentally downgrade sometime later in their lifecycle, due either to bugs in the code or malicious activity? Crucially, SPQR only allows a downgrade when it first receives a message from a remote party. So, Bob can only downgrade if he receives his first message from Alice and notices that she doesn’t support SPQR, and Alice will only downgrade if she receives her first reply from Bob and notices that he doesn’t. After that first back-and-forth, SPQR is locked in and used for the remainder of the session.</p><p>Finally, those familiar with Signal’s internal workings might note that Signal sessions last a really long time, potentially years. Can we ever say “every session is protected by SPQR”, given that SPQR is only added to new sessions as they’re being initiated? To accomplish this, Signal will eventually (once all clients support the new protocol) roll out a code change that enforces SPQR for all sessions, and that archives all sessions which don’t yet have that protection. After the full rollout of that future update, we’ll be able to confidently assert complete coverage of SPQR.</p><p>One nice benefit to setting up this “maybe downgrade if the other side doesn’t support things” approach is that it also sets us up for the future: the same mechanisms that allow us to choose between SPQR or no-SPQR are designed to also allow us to upgrade from SPQR to some far-future (as yet unimagined) SPQRv2.</p><h2 id="making-sure-we-get-it-right">Making Sure We Get It Right</h2><p>Complex protocols require extraordinary care. We have to ensure that the new protocol doesn’t lose any of the security guarantees the Double Ratchet gives us. We have to ensure that we actually get the post-quantum protection we’re aiming for. And even then, after we have full confidence in the protocol, we have to make sure that our implementation is correct and robust and stays that way as we maintain it. This is a tall order.</p><p>To make sure we got this right, we started by building the protocol on a firm foundation of fundamental research. We built on the years of research the academic community has put into secure messaging and we collaborated with researchers from PQShield, AIST, and NYU to explore what was possible with post-quantum secure messaging. In <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/078">a paper at Eurocrypt 25</a> we introduced erasure code based chunking and proposed the high-level Triple Ratchet protocol, proving that it gave us the post-quantum security we wanted without taking away any of the security of the classic Double Ratchet. In <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/usenixsecurity25-auerbach.pdf">a follow up paper at USENIX 25</a>, we observed that there are many different ways to design a post-quantum ratchet protocol and we need to pick the one that protects user messages the best. We introduced and analyzed six different protocols and two stood out: one is essentially SPQR, the other is a protocol using a new KEM, called Katana, that we designed just for ratcheting. That second one is exciting, but we want to stick to standards to start!</p><h2 id="formal-verification-from-the-start">Formal Verification From the Start</h2><p>This research gave us the framework to think about protocol design and prove protocols are secure, but there is a big leap from an academic paper to code. Already when designing <a href="https://signal.org/blog/pqxdh/">PQXDH</a> - a much simpler protocol! - <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/usenixsecurity24-bhargavan.pdf">we found that formal verification was an important tool for getting the details right</a>. With the Triple Ratchet we partnered with Cryspen and made formal verification part of the process from the beginning.</p><p>As we kept finding better protocol candidates - and we implemented around a dozen of them - we modeled them in <a href="https://bblanche.gitlabpages.inria.fr/proverif/">ProVerif</a> to prove that they had the security properties we needed. Rather than wrapping up a protocol design and performing formal verification as a last step we made it a core part of the design process. Now that the design is settled, this gives us machine verified proof that our protocol has the security properties we demand from it. We wrote our Rust code to closely match the ProVerif models, so it is easy to check that we’re modeling what we implement. In particular, ProVerif is very good at reasoning about state machines, which we’re already using, making the mapping from code to model much simpler.</p><p>We are taking formal verification further than that, though. We are using <a href="https://github.com/cryspen/hax">hax</a> to translate our Rust implementation into <a href="https://fstar-lang.org/">F*</a> on every CI run. Once the F* models are extracted, we prove that core parts of our highly optimized implementation are correct, that function pre-conditions and post-conditions cannot be violated, and that the entire crate is panic free. That last one is a big deal. It is great for usability, of course, because nobody wants their app to crash. But it also matters for correctness. We aggressively add assertions about things we believe must be true when the protocol is running correctly - and we crash the app if they are false. With hax and F*, we prove that those assertions will never fail.</p><h2 id="formal-verification-doesnt-freeze-our-progress">Formal Verification Doesn’t Freeze Our Progress</h2><p>Often when people think about formally verified protocol implementations, they imagine a one-time huge investment in verification that leaves you with a codebase frozen in time. This is not the case here. We re-run formal verification in our CI pipeline every time a developer pushes a change to GitHub. If the proofs fail then the build fails, and the developer needs to fix it. In our experience so far, this is usually as simple as adding a pre- or postcondition or returning an error when a value is out of bounds. For us, formal verification is a dynamic part of the development process and ensures that the quality is high on every merge.</p><h2 id="tldr">TLDR</h2><p>Signal is rolling out a new version of the Signal Protocol with the Triple Ratchet. It adds the Sparse Post-Quantum Ratchet, or SPQR, to the existing Double Ratchet to create a new Triple Ratchet which gives our users quantum-safe messaging without taking away any of our existing security promises. It’s being added in such a way that it can be rolled out without disruption. It’s relatively lightweight, not using much additional bandwidth for each message, to keep network costs low for our users. It’s resistant to meddling by malicious middlemen - to disrupt it, all messages after a certain time must be dropped, causing a noticeable denial of service for users. We’re rolling it out slowly and carefully now, but in such a way that we’ll eventually be able to say with confidence “every message sent by Signal is protected by this.” Its code has been formally verified, and will continue to be so even as future updates affect the protocol. It’s the combined effort of Signal employees and external researchers and contributors, and it’s only possible due to the continued work and diligence of the larger crypto community. And as a user of Signal, our biggest hope is that you never even notice or care. Except one day, when headlines scream “OMG, quantum computers are here”, you can look back on this blog post and say “oh, I guess I don’t have to care about that, because it’s already been handled”, as you sip your Nutri-Algae while your self-driving flying car wends its way through the floating tenements of Megapolis Prime.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>Autism should not be viewed as a single condition with a unified underlying cause, according to scientists who found that those diagnosed early in childhood typically have a distinct genetic profile to those diagnosed later.</p><p>The international study, based on genetic data from more than 45,000 autistic people in Europe and the US, showed that those diagnosed in early childhood, typically before six years old, were more likely to show behavioural difficulties from early childhood, including problems with social interaction, but remain stable.</p><p>Those diagnosed with autism later, typically after the age of 10, were more likely to experience increasing social and behavioural difficulties during adolescence and also had an increased likelihood of mental health conditions such as depression.</p><p>“The term ‘autism’ likely describes multiple conditions,” said Dr Varun Warrier, from Cambridge’s department of psychiatry, senior author of the research. “For the first time, we have found that earlier and later diagnosed autism have different underlying biological and developmental profiles.”</p><p>The scientists are not advocating for a move towards two diagnostic categories, saying that this could be unhelpful for the many who fall somewhere in the middle.</p><p>“It is a gradient,” said Warrier. “There are also many other factors that contribute to age of diagnosis, so the moment you go from averages to anything that is applicable to an individual, it’s false equivalency.”</p><p>The findings come at a time when autism diagnosis has risen steeply, with a nearly <a href="https://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcpp.13505" data-link-name="in body link">800% increase in diagnoses in the UK</a> between 1998 and 2018. Experts say this is due largely to a widening of the diagnostic criteria and greater recognition of the condition.</p><p>And, while autism is defined by having challenges with social communication, sensory processing and restrictive behaviours, there is huge variability in how these difficulties present between individuals. Scientists have been looking at whether the population clusters into subgroups, with shared traits or trajectories, that could make studying autism more tractable.</p><p>The latest study used behavioural data from four birth cohorts, ranging from 89 to 188 people, and genetic data from two large studies, with more than 45,000 participants.</p><p>Previously, it was generally assumed that those diagnosed earlier tended to be those with more marked autistic traits, underpinned by people carrying a higher proportion of autism-linked gene variants. However, the latest study revealed a different pattern.</p><figure id="84037ab2-e09e-4580-a076-837487e8ab1e" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:10,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Autistic people could teach Donald Trump a thing or two about focus, facts and empathy | Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;84037ab2-e09e-4580-a076-837487e8ab1e&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/28/autistic-people-donald-trump-autism-us-president-rfk-jr&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;design&quot;:0,&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:0}}"></gu-island></figure><p>The analysis,<em> </em><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09542-6" data-link-name="in body link">published in Nature</a><em>,</em> found that the underlying genetic profiles differed between those diagnosed with autism earlier and later in life, with only a modest overlap. The average genetic profile of later-diagnosed autism is closer to that of ADHD, as well as to mental health conditions such as depression and PTSD, than it is to autism diagnosed in early childhood.</p><p>Those diagnosed before the age of six years were more likely to be slow to walk and have difficulty interpreting hand gestures and tended to experience social and communication difficulties that appeared early but remained stable.

      <p>For 16+ years, we master the rules of school. Study hard, get good grades, follow the formula and ultimately merit wins. Then we enter the workforce and none of it works quite like we thought.&nbsp;This becomes painfully obvious as you rise higher in the org. </p><p>Even seasoned veterans forget this. Recently, a director-level client hit a minor career bump and spiraled into crisis mode, their expectations still anchored in what I call "school rules".</p><p><strong>Organizations don't run purely on merit or even clear criteria. Although they claim otherwise using buzzwords like “merit” and “data”.</strong> That’s only one part of the story, and also what’s visible.&nbsp;</p><p>The other part, often more consequential, runs on flawed psychology, imperfect decisions, and competing interests. <mark>You can call it<strong>&nbsp;organizational absurdities. Or more bluntly, institutional stupidity.</strong></mark></p><p>What follows is a reality check. It’s a “letter to frustrated high-performers” who keep bumping up against these unwritten rules of work. Consider it your guide to staying sane while playing the long game.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.leadingsapiens.com/surviving-institutional-stupidity/#if-you-have-to-blame-stupidity-not-malice">If you have to, blame stupidity not malice</a></li><li><a href="https://www.leadingsapiens.com/surviving-institutional-stupidity/#organizations-are-anything-but-meritocracies">Organizations are anything but meritocracies</a></li><li><a href="https://www.leadingsapiens.com/surviving-institutional-stupidity/#perception-matters-as-much-as-performance">Perception matters as much as performance</a></li><li><a href="https://www.leadingsapiens.com/surviving-institutional-stupidity/#don%E2%80%99t-waste-time-fighting-for-%E2%80%9Cobjective-fairness%E2%80%9D" rel="noreferrer">Don’t waste time fighting for “objective fairness.”</a></li><li><a href="https://www.leadingsapiens.com/surviving-institutional-stupidity/#positioning-what-you-offer">Positioning what you offer</a></li><li><a href="https://www.leadingsapiens.com/surviving-institutional-stupidity/#mind-the-gap-your-standards-vs-their%E2%80%99s" rel="noreferrer">Mind the gap: your standards vs their’s</a></li><li><a href="https://www.leadingsapiens.com/surviving-institutional-stupidity/#higher-you-go-more-it%E2%80%99s-an-inverted-funnel" rel="noreferrer">Higher you go, more it’s an inverted funnel</a></li><li><a href="https://www.leadingsapiens.com/surviving-institutional-stupidity/#know-which-game-you%E2%80%99re-choosing-to-play" rel="noreferrer">Know which game you’re choosing to play</a></li><li><a href="https://www.leadingsapiens.com/surviving-institutional-stupidity/#watching-your-circle-of-control">Watching your circle of control</a></li><li><a href="https://www.leadingsapiens.com/surviving-institutional-stupidity/#keep-a-balanced-portfolio">Keep a balanced portfolio</a></li></ul><div><p>💡</p><p><i><em>Before diving in, a quick note: This piece deliberately spotlights the subjective aspects of organizational life. While companies strive for objectivity in all areas, there's an overlooked undercurrent of subjectivity that significantly impacts work, and careers. By highlighting this less-discussed dimension, I hope to provide a more complete picture and prevent unnecessary frustration. You won’t avoid it completely, but at least you’ll be better equipped.</em></i></p></div><hr><h2 id="if-you-have-to-blame-stupidity-not-malice"><strong>If you have to, blame stupidity not malice</strong></h2><p>Most of what we chalk up to “politics” or “backstabbing”, aka bad intent, is often better explained by stupidity, inertia, bad incentives, fragmented attention, and misaligned maps of reality.</p><p>People are juggling too much, thinking too little, and rarely stepping back to ask, “What actually makes sense here?”</p><p>When you assume stupidity instead of malice, you stay above the fray, stop taking slights personally, or turning misjudgments into betrayals. This way we retain agency and choice.</p><p><mark><strong>Assuming malice turns you into a cynic. In contrast, assuming stupidity keeps you curious.</strong>&nbsp;</mark> Instead of fighting ghosts, you study the system and ask better questions:</p><ul><li>What pressures is that person responding to?</li><li>What game are they trying to win?</li><li>What am I assuming as rational that’s not?</li></ul><p>No one is out to get you; they’re just out to get through the week. The shift from malice to stupidity gives you just enough distance to be curious instead of reactive.</p><h2 id="organizations-are-anything-but-meritocracies"><strong>Organizations are anything but meritocracies</strong></h2><p>Managers will claim they are, and we want to believe them. But the reality is that the best don’t always rise. At least not as easily or automatically as we think they should.</p><p>Sometimes they do. But often, what gets rewarded isn’t performance but proximity to power, timing, perception, and political usefulness.</p><p><mark>This doesn’t mean performance doesn’t matter.&nbsp;<strong>It means performance is necessary but not sufficient.</strong></mark>&nbsp;It is the entry ticket&nbsp;that gets you through the door, but does not guarantee a seat at the table.</p><p><strong>Assuming that excellence is obvious is the fatal error of the conscientious expert. </strong>Although it creates value, performance doesn’t automatically generate visibility, influence, or narrative. And those are the currencies that get traded when decisions are made by humans.</p><p>Merit matters, but it needs a stage and a spotlight. It doesn’t mean becoming a shameless self-promoter. Rather,<mark>&nbsp;<strong>your work needs a distribution strategy.&nbsp;</strong></mark></p><h2 id="perception-matters-as-much-as-performance"><strong>Perception matters as much as performance</strong></h2><p>In school, everyone was evaluated against an objective criteria by someone paid to assess fairly.&nbsp;</p><p>In organizations, no such thing exists.<mark>&nbsp;<strong>Instead, perception&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;the “data”.</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></mark>And this data is constructed often haphazardly by busy people working off limited inputs. You have to manage the story by<a href="https://www.leadingsapiens.com/impression-management/" rel="noreferrer">&nbsp;shaping impressions intentionally</a>.</p><p>Not only does perception matter as much as performance but <a href="https://www.leadingsapiens.com/schrodingers-cat-at-work/" rel="noreferrer">who’s doing the perceiving</a> matters even more.&nbsp;</p><p>Not all perceivers are created equal. A peer may love your work but they might not be a critical node in the web of influence. Who gets consulted? Do they know what you’ve built, and have they heard your name in relevant contexts?</p><p><strong><mark>It’s not just “do great work.”; it’s also “do the work that’s perceived as valuable.” </mark></strong>This means translating your work’s significance up the chain and shape its interpretation. If not, others will do it for you and they may not be generous, or even accurate.</p><p>For more, see my last two articles:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.leadingsapiens.com/schrodingers-cat-at-work/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Schrodinger’s Cat at Work Part I</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.leadingsapiens.com/schrodingers-cat-building-the-box-of-limitations/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Schrodinger’s Cat at Work Part II</a>.</p><h2 id="don%E2%80%99t-waste-time-fighting-for-%E2%80%9Cobjective-fairness%E2%80%9D"><strong>Don’t waste time fighting for “objective fairness.”</strong></h2><p>On paper, organizations love metrics: KPIs, OKRs, dashboards. They create the appearance of detached objectivity.</p><p>Meanwhile, subjective decisions are constantly happening behind the scenes. The decisions about who to trust, or who gets a shot are made through informal reputations and shared stories about your value. Then the “data” is used to justify them in retrospect.</p><p>Rather than rant against the system,&nbsp;<strong>get good at reading the underlying subjective logic</strong>:</p><ul><li>Who does this person trust, and why?</li><li>What do they consider strategic vs tactical?</li><li>What would make them feel safe betting on me?</li></ul><p>Subjectivity isn’t the enemy. It’s the underlying physics of it.</p><h2 id="positioning-what-you-offer"><strong>Positioning what you offer</strong></h2><p>You may have had the right message but at the wrong moment, or in the wrong wrapper.</p><p>Positioning is the context around your contributions:&nbsp;<em>Why now? Why you? Why this way?</em>&nbsp;A good idea, or stellar performance, poorly positioned can seem irrelevant. In contrast, a mediocre one nicely positioned is deemed visionary.</p><p>It’s not just&nbsp;<em>what</em>&nbsp;you say but also&nbsp;<em>when</em>,&nbsp;<em>how</em>, and&nbsp;<em>through whom</em>&nbsp;you say it.</p><p>Persistence matters as well.&nbsp;<strong><mark>Think in campaigns, not just one-time efforts. </mark></strong>In my piece on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.leadingsapiens.com/effective-leadership-as-effective-conversations/" rel="noreferrer">effective conversations</a>&nbsp;I wrote:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><em>It is the series of messages in different forms that over time makes the difference. More akin to waves shaping the shoreline rather than the occasional once in a lifetime tsunami.</em></blockquote><p>What messages are you sending, are they varied, and are you doing it consistently? <strong>This is as true for marketing products as it is for positioning yourself inside organizations.</strong></p><h2 id="mind-the-gap-your-standards-vs-their%E2%80%99s">Mind the gap: your standards vs their’s</h2><p>Another obvious but forgotten reality of organizational life:&nbsp;<strong>Not everyone operates by the same playbook.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>You prioritize substance and direct contribution, while others focus on visibility and relationship-building in ways that are uncomfortable to you. It’s that colleague who excels at positioning routine work as “strategic”, or the peer who builds influence through cultivating key relationships.</p><p>And yes, these approaches do yield results.</p><p>But this doesn’t mean dismissing it as pure politics or simply abandoning your principles. It means understanding the landscape you're operating in.&nbsp;</p><p>You can’t effectively participate in a game you refuse to see clearly.&nbsp;You're not at a disadvantage because you choose to act with integrity. It’s because you fail to recognize that influence flows through multiple channels and&nbsp;others are willing to play differently.&nbsp;</p><p><mark><strong>The key is not to match their behavior but to factor it in</strong>.&nbsp;Instead of expecting fairness,&nbsp;<strong>anticipate asymmetry</strong>.</mark>&nbsp;And then get creative about how you play.&nbsp;</p><p>Being ethical <strong>doesn’t mean being passive but  tactically awake.&nbsp;</strong></p><h2 id="higher-you-go-more-it%E2%80%99s-an-inverted-funnel"><strong>Higher you go, more it’s an inverted funnel</strong></h2><p>Perhaps the most obvious point but also<strong>&nbsp;easy to forget especially if your career has been on autopilot so far.</strong></p><p>There’s a bottleneck up top: fewer seats, more ambiguity, less structure and high subjectivity. It’s not just hard to get in but even harder to stay clear on what “good” even looks like.</p><p>This means you can do everything right and still get passed over. <strong>That’s not a verdict on your worth or ability, just geometry.</strong></p><p>It also means that staying the course when things don’t go your way isn’t just a virtue but a practice. To play the long game, you have to keep showing up even after crushing disappointment without getting cynical of the process. Put differently, <strong>you need high levels of </strong><a href="https://www.leadingsapiens.com/frustration-tolerance/" rel="noreferrer"><strong>frustration tolerance</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>Cliched? Yes, very much so, but also uncommon. It means if you can pull it off, it’s a <a href="https://www.leadingsapiens.com/sources-of-power-in-organizations/" rel="noreferrer">source of power</a>.</p><h2 id="know-which-game-you%E2%80%99re-choosing-to-play"><strong>Know which game you’re choosing to play</strong></h2><p>There is no one game being played. There are multiple, overlapping games with different scoring systems. Some are playing to build long-term credibility; others for short-term visibility.&nbsp;</p><p>You can’t play them all and neither should you try.</p><p><strong><mark>The real problem is we slide into playing someone else's game without realizing it.</mark></strong>&nbsp;We adopt the norms and metrics of others without checking if that’s the game we actually want to play, let alone win. So we end up optimizing for a role we don’t respect, or chasing promotions that hollow us out.</p><p>Whatever you’re doing, own it outright. Not just the upside but also the downside. If you're focused on building something lasting like developing others, or robust systems, you need to accept that visible status markers (titles, promotions, recognition) might not happen right away.</p><p>The danger isn't which path you pick, whether it's chasing promotions or maintaining your autonomy.&nbsp;<strong><mark>The real disaster is to sleepwalk down a path while pretending you had no choice in the matter.</mark></strong></p><h2 id="watching-your-circle-of-control">Watching your circle of control</h2><p>An easy way to burn out is to focus relentlessly on<strong> things you care about but cannot actually influence</strong>. Over time, especially in large organizations, it's tempting to attribute everything to forces outside yourself. This induces <a href="https://www.leadingsapiens.com/locus-of-control/#locus-of-control-and-learned-helplessness-in-organizations" rel="noreferrer">organizational helplessness</a>. A sense that nothing you do matters unless someone above says so.</p><p>Fight that, not with bluster, but with deliberate ownership of <a href="https://www.leadingsapiens.com/circle-of-control-influence-concerns/" rel="noreferrer">the space you control and influence</a>.&nbsp;While experienced professionals often have more influence than they think, it's distributed differently than they expect.&nbsp;</p><p>The key is maintaining <a href="https://www.leadingsapiens.com/locus-of-control/" rel="noreferrer">an internal locus of control</a> which includes your positioning, relationships, and what you are building.</p><h2 id="keep-a-balanced-portfolio"><strong>Keep a balanced portfolio</strong></h2><p>This is a well-understood concept in investing but often missing in the context of long careers. If all your identity is wrapped up in organizational validation, you're fragile. This means setbacks&nbsp;don't just rattle your job, it rattles your sense of self.</p><p>Many mid-career professionals learn this the hard way. To state the obvious: you are not your title, or your most recent performance review.</p><p><strong><mark>The anti-dote is diversification not of money, but meaning.</mark></strong></p><p>Rebalancing here means investing in other sources of connection and community. This includes:</p><ul><li>Developing a craft that exists beyond a given employer.</li><li>Investing in communities that outlast org charts.</li><li>Projects, relationships, and sources of learning that replenish.</li></ul><p>You are building <a href="https://www.leadingsapiens.com/adaptive-capacity/" rel="noreferrer">adaptive capacity</a>.</p><p>A balanced portfolio also helps to play the long game with more&nbsp;<a href="https://www.leadingsapiens.com/courage-modern-leadership-organizations/" rel="noreferrer">psychological courage</a>&nbsp;because your whole life isn't riding on the next promotion cycle or external validation.</p><h2 id="in-closing"><strong>In closing</strong></h2><p>By recognizing the subjective currents that shape work environments, we can operate within them more skillfully.</p><p>This isn't cynicism or gaming the system. Rather, it's developing a nuanced understanding of how organizations actually function. This stance equips us to make more intentional choices about how to engage, contribute, and create meaning.</p><p>As ideal as it sounds, the goal isn't to eliminate organizational absurdities, but to work effectively within and around them. By staying in the game, you find ways to gradually improve the system from within.&nbsp;</p><p><mark>Organizations are ultimately human constructs.<strong>&nbsp;Imperfect, but not immutable.</strong></mark></p>

</p>

<p>Since the very beginning of n8n we’ve heard many of you mention the need for a proper table inside n8n to store data between workflow executions without needing to switch platforms or setting up credentials and now it’s finally here.</p>
<p>With data tables you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Save specific data from your workflow runs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep data around between multiple executions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid duplicate runs by tracking execution status</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Store reusable prompts for different workflows</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collect evaluation data for your AI workflows</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do lookups, merges, enhancements…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>…and honestly, probably 100 other creative things we haven’t even thought of yet  <img src="https://community.n8n.io/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=14" title=":smiley:" alt=":smiley:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

If you’re self-hosting (and know what you’re doing), you can change that via the ENV variable <code>N8N_DATA_TABLES_MAX_SIZE_BYTES</code></p>

            <p>This is absolutely awesome to see, I can’t wait to use these! It’s probably been my number one frustration that saving even a small amount of data between executions for all sorts of purposes requires either integrating PostgreSQL and dealing with schemas, using a third party database or API like Supabase (as handy as they are), or using variables that are powerful but are somewhat clumsy to instantiate and track since they only work in Code nodes and only save data for production executions, making testing hard. Hoping data-tables makes a ton of these things easier! Probably won’t run the new version until it’s in final release rather than pre-release, but this is awesome to see!</p>

            <p>This is really great - when I migrated from “the other platform” almost 4 years ago, I really felt the pain of not having a simple in-app data storage. I played around with Data tables this weekend and it’s just SUCH a good and fast experience! Kudos to our Product and Engineering teams <img src="https://community.n8n.io/images/emoji/twitter/clap.png?v=14" title=":clap:" alt=":clap:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

              <p>Hey all,</p>
<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: There is an issue with very large SQLite databases that is causing instances to slow down. Out of an abundance of caution, we are unfortunately removing version 1.113.0 until we fix this issue. We hope to have this released again with a fix within the next couple of days.</p>
<p>Very sorry about this!</p>

              <p>This is great!</p>
<p>It´d be cool for self hosting to be able to add a second DB, where n8n pulls the data from. So one could have performance without having to set up each time a postgres connection.</p>

              <p>Very happy to see this feature. I’ve been testing it out, and was commenting feedback on Reddit but someone in the Discord server said the forums is the best place to post this instead.  Here’s my list(so far)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>When going to the Data Tables tab, “Create Table” is not default on the upper right button, it’s defaulted to “Create Workflow” instead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cannot change the data type after a column is created.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cannot set any of the column’s as primary or unique such as the ID column (To prevent duplicates)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For some odd reason, setting a column data type to “number” then pushing data from JSON array into the table, physically opening the table and looking at the rows, the numbers in the “number” data type column are not all together. For example “29683389” shows in the table as “29 683 389”. This isn’t a one off either, ALL rows exhibit the same behavior and ALL columns set as “numbers” too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Table page can only show 50 rows per page. Which I understand is probably for performance reasons. However, there really needs to be a “search” function for the table to search for data.</p>

1, 2 and 5 are all planned. For (4), I think that is just a highlighting to make it easier to read that it’s actually 29M. So the number should still be correct.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Meta, having committed hundreds of billions to AI infrastructure and talent, says it will start using people's conversations and interactions with its AI services to create personalized content and advertising.</p>
<p>This applies to <a href="https://www.meta.ai/">Meta AI</a>, the company's web-based chat interface, and apps that integrate Meta AI, such as Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger.</p>
<p>Meta intends to begin using people's text exchanges and voice conversations with its AI service to generate personalized posts, reels, and other attention lures starting on December 16, 2025.</p>

    

<p>"For example, if you chat with Meta AI about hiking, we may learn that you’re interested in hiking – just as we would if you posted a reel about hiking or liked a hiking-related Page," the company <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/10/improving-your-recommendations-apps-ai-meta/">explained</a> in its announcement. "As a result, you might start seeing recommendations for hiking groups, posts from friends about trails, or ads for hiking boots."</p>

        


        

<p>A notification campaign about the change begins October 7, 2025.</p>
<p>There's no opt-out, but Meta has spared those who live in the EU, the UK, and South Korea for the time being.</p>

        

<p>The social networking giant and metaverse money-burner will let users make some adjustments to its <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/09/introducing-vibes-ai-videos/">slop</a>-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Force-feeding&amp;oldid=1311058453">gavage</a> loop with its <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/109378269482053">Ads Preferences</a> and <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2022/10/new-ways-to-customize-your-facebook-feed/">feed customization</a> controls.</p>
<p>Meta insists it won't personalize ads based on conversations that touch on religion, sexual orientation, politics, health, race, ethnicity, philosophical belief, or trade union membership.</p>
<p>That list of untouchable topics suggests canny Meta users could stymie the personalization plan by prefixing every interaction with a suitably sensitive term – for example, start every interaction with "Pray tell..." or “Oh, Lord, Meta really thought this was a good idea?”</p>

</ul>
<p>Known as Facebook until brand damage from incessant privacy scandals inspired <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/facebook-company-is-now-meta/">a name change in 2021</a>, Meta was notionally focused on the metaverse – an ill-defined term for immersive digital experiences that may or may not involve goggles. Having spent something like <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/01/metas_metaverse_mention/">$60 billion on its Reality Labs group</a> without much to show for it (apart from the privacy-invading Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses), Meta lately has taken to talking up AI.</p>
<p>CEO Mark Zuckerberg last month told President Trump that Meta plans to invest $600 billion on AI investment through 2028 – and surely that will happen because Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.threads.com/@zuck/post/DORJoYgkXUH?xmt=AQF0CNIpSRsk_HIXDmfYchDE46PSmeeKhR344m0c25Bl-A">said it</a>, even if other massive AI spending projects like Stargate’s <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/softbank-openai-a3dc57b4">promised $500 billion AI infrastructure investments</a> don’t quite add up.</p>

        

<p>Meta's interest in AI, however, is really about ads – using AI to encourage exposure to and engagement with ads, some of which may be generated by AI. The company has already <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/01/meta_ai_investments/">said</a> AI has helped boost engagement with ads posted to its platforms. Execs also see AI as making it easier to advertisers to create and manage campaigns.</p>
<p>As noted by the UK's Open Rights Group, 98 percent of Meta’s <a href="https://investor.atmeta.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2025/Meta-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2024-Results/">$165 billion of revenue in 2024</a> came from advertising, resulting in net income of $62.4 billion.</p>
<p>Iesha White, director of intelligence for marketing watchdog Check My Ads, told <em>The Register</em> in an email that several AI companies like Perplexity and OpenAI have integrated advertising into their AI products.</p>
<p>"But this is different – Meta’s core business is monetizing ad space across its owned and operated sites and apps, in addition to ad placements on external publisher partnerships via its Facebook Audience Network product," said White. "By harvesting data from its AI chats across WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook, Meta gains yet another closed-loop data source, meaning Meta could reduce transparency of the targeting inputs across its advertising products, in the name of privacy.</p>
<p>"It also provides an opportunity for Meta to further shape and obfuscate its attribution models using its own source of truth, with brands unable to independently audit a campaign’s true effectiveness."</p>
<p>Meta coincidentally is fighting a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://searchengineland.com/supreme-court-meta-ad-fraud-case-proceed-450504">$7 billion class action</a> <a href="https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2024/03/21/22-15916.pdf">lawsuit</a> [PDF] brought by advertisers who claim that Meta fraudulently represented the potential reach of its ads by citing user accounts rather than actual people – a charge Meta disputes. ®</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/02/eu_spyware_funding/">https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/02/eu_spyware_funding/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45448825">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>An arsenal of angry European Parliament members (MEPs) is demanding answers from senior commissioners about why EU subsidies are ending up in the pockets of spyware companies.</p>
<p>The group of 39 politicians referred to recent investigations that revealed countries such as Italy, Greece, Hungary, and Spain have funnelled millions of taxpayer euros at a time to help support commercial spyware-makers' finances.</p>
<p>They wrote: "According to these findings, entities such as Intellexa, Cy4Gate, Verint and Cognyte – whose technologies have been linked to unlawful surveillance of journalists, human rights defenders and political actors in the EU, as well as in third countries with dreadful human rights records – have benefitted from public financing, including EU programmes.</p>

    

<p>"This raises serious questions about the governance, transparency, and accountability of the Union's funding mechanisms. In the light of the scandals uncovered in Italy, Greece, Poland, Hungary, and Spain, among others, and of the recommendations of the PEGA inquiry, it is deeply troubling that the Union is directly or indirectly enabling tools that erode democracy, fundamental rights, and the rule of law."</p>

        


        

<p>MEPs cited investigative journalism from <a href="https://www.ftm.eu/articles/spyware-industry-eu-subsidies-surveillance-concers" rel="nofollow">Follow The Money</a>, which revealed in September that institutions such as Spain's public-funded Centre for the Development Of Industrial Technology (CDTI) handed over €1.3 million (c $1.5 million) to now-shuttered spyware peddler Mollitiam Industries.</p>

<p>Likewise, Italy's state-owned bank, <a target="_blank" href="https://youreurope.europa.eu/business/finance-funding/getting-funding/access-finance/en/content/mediocredito-centrale-spa">Mediocredito Centrale</a>, was found to have acted as a guarantor to a €2.5 million (c $2.9 million) loan to Dataflow Security, an Italy-based commercial spyware developer.</p>
<p>FTM said that it did not prove that any of the money, in any of the cases it found, was used to directly fund spyware development, although funding was provided in several instances.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://x.com/HNeumannMEP/status/1973321519548997804/photo/1" rel="nofollow">letter</a> addressed to senior commissioners Henna Virkkunen (Finland), Michael McGrath (Ireland), and Piotr Serafin (Poland) – who oversee tech, justice, and anti-fraud respectively – requested greater transparency over how EU funds were distributed, among other matters.</p>

        

<p>Various questions were raised by the MEPs, such as how the European Commission verifies the integrity of the entities that receive EU funds, whether any risk assessments are carried out before investments are made to spyware companies, and how much money in total has been awarded to these organizations.</p>
<p>They also asked for answers on how the Commission plans to ensure its funding mechanisms align with its stances on matters such as human rights and digital resilience, and why it has not implemented the recommendations made by the <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/09/pega_commitee_report/">PEGA inquiry</a>.</p>
<p><em>The Register</em> approached the European Commission for a response to the letter.</p>

        

<p>For the uninitiated, the PEGA inquiry was launched in 2022 following reports of several EU governments using <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/19/pegasus_spyware_met_police_complaint/">NSO Group's Pegasus spyware</a> a year earlier, and three years after Saudi journalist <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/03/01/in_brief_security/">Jamal Khashoggi's murder</a>.</p>
<p>The results were published in 2023, branding the pervasive spyware use "Europe's Watergate" and a "severe violation of all the values of the European Union."</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/A-9-2023-0189_EN.html#_section2" rel="nofollow">report</a> stated: "The spyware scandal is not a series of isolated national cases of abuse, but a full-blown European affair.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"EU Member State governments have been using spyware on their citizens for political purposes and to cover up corruption and criminal activity. Some went even further and embedded spyware in a system deliberately designed for authoritarian rule."</p>
<p>Among the main recommendations made by the PEGA committee were to restrict law enforcement's use of spyware only to exceptional cases, protect sensitive targets like politicians, lawyers, and doctors, and to set the conditions for legal use.</p>
<p>The 39 MEPs asked the European Commission to additionally commit to launching an immediate public review of EU subsidies flowing into spyware companies.</p>
<p>In that review, the politicians specifically requested details on all funds issued and awarded to spyware companies since 2015, a commitment to excluding all spyware vendors from future EU funding instruments, and a follow-up on the PEGA recommendations.</p>
<p>"Citizens of the Union have the right to know whether their taxes are being used to finance technologies that endanger their fundamental rights," they wrote.&nbsp;</p>

</ul>
<p>"As Members of the European Parliament, we expect your full cooperation in ensuring accountability and restoring public trust."</p>
<p>Rebecca White, researcher and advisor on targeted surveillance at Amnesty Tech's Security Lab, said she and Amnesty support the letter, and highlighted the Commission's lack of communication on the matter.</p>
<p>She told <em>The Register</em>: "At Amnesty, we've documented for many years how spyware has enabled human rights abuses in Europe and beyond, and how the surveillance industry is under-regulated and thriving.</p>
<p>"The European Commission has remained silent. These latest allegations should alarm all of us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"They suggest that not only is the EU failing to put out the fire, they're fanning the flames. We welcome this collective call for transparency and explanations – the Commission can no longer wash its hands of Europe's complicity in the spyware crisis, which is fuelling human rights abuses across the world."</p>
<p>Aljosa Ajanovic Andelic, policy advisor at European Digital Rights (EDRi), echoed the MEPs' request for a ban on spyware.</p>
<p>He said: "The lack of action by the Commission when it comes to spyware is appalling and dangerous. In fact, not only have they not done anything to stop the proliferation of shady spyware vendors in the EU, they actually used EU taxpayers' money to directly fund the industry. This has to stop, and we are calling for a full ban on commercial spyware in the EU."</p>
<p>"As the largest digital rights network in Europe, our position is firm: the use of spyware is inherently incompatible with fundamental rights, and therefore should be banned, as well as the market of private companies that are profiting from human rights violations." ®</p>

<p><img alt="Red Hat logo" height="900" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/hl-images/2025/10/02/redhat-header-vign.jpg" width="1600"></p>

<p>An extortion group calling itself the Crimson Collective claims to have breached Red Hat's private GitHub repositories, stealing nearly 570GB of compressed data across 28,000 internal projects.</p>

<p>This data allegedly includes approximately 800 Customer Engagement Reports (CERs), which can contain sensitive information about a customer's network and platforms.</p>

<p>A CER is a&nbsp;consulting document prepared for clients that often contains infrastructure details, configuration data, authentication tokens, and other information that could be abused to breach customer networks.</p>

<p>Red Hat confirmed that it suffered a security incident related to its consulting business,&nbsp;but would not verify any of the attacker's claims regarding the stolen GitHub repositories and customer CERs.</p>

<p>"Red Hat is aware of reports regarding a security incident related to our consulting business and we have initiated necessary remediation steps," Red Hat told BleepingComputer.</p>

<p>"The security and integrity of our systems and the data entrusted to us are our highest priority. At this time, we have no reason to believe the security issue impacts any of our other Red Hat services or products and are highly confident in the integrity of our software supply chain."</p>

<p>While Red Hat did not respond to any further questions about the breach, the hackers told BleepingComputer that the intrusion occurred approximately two weeks ago.</p>

<p>They allegedly found authentication tokens, full database URIs, and other private information in Red Hat code and CERs, which they claimed to use to gain access to downstream customer infrastructure.</p>

<p>The hacking group also published a complete directory listing of the allegedly stolen GitHub repositories&nbsp;and a list of CERs from 2020 through 2025 on Telegram.</p>

<p>The directory listing of CERs include a wide range of sectors and well known organizations such as Bank of America, T-Mobile, AT&amp;T, Fidelity, Kaiser, Mayo Clinic, Walmart, Costco,&nbsp;the U.S. Navy’s Naval Surface Warfare Center, Federal Aviation Administration, the House of Representatives, and many others.</p>

<p>If you have any information regarding this incident or any other undisclosed attacks, you can contact us confidentially via Signal at 646-961-3731 or at tips@bleepingcomputer.com.</p>

<p>The hackers stated that they attempted to contact Red Hat with an extortion demand but received no response other than a templated reply instructing them to submit a vulnerability report to their security team.</p>

<p>According to them, the created ticket was repeatedly assigned to additional people, including Red Hat's legal and security staff members.</p>

<p>BleepingComputer sent Red Hat additional questions, and we will update this story if we receive more information.</p>

<p>The same group also claimed responsibility for briefly <a href="http://x.com/pirat_nation/status/1970821013559538141" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">defacing Nintendo’s topic page</a> last week to include contact information and links to their Telegram channel</p>

				<p>Bits of Freedom sued Meta for a breach of the Digital Services Act (DSA). This European legislation is intended to give users more autonomy and control over the major online platforms. One of the core elements of the DSA is that users must have greater influence over the information they see.</p>
<p>For many people, and especially for young people, social media platforms are a major source of news and information. Therefore it is crucial that users themselves can decide which content appears on their feed. Without that freedom of choice, participation in the public debate is seriously hampered. That is problematic at any time, but especially so during election periods. In the Netherlands, national elections will be held at the end of this month.</p>
<p>The judge states that Meta is indeed acting in violation of the law. He says that “a non‑persistent choice option for a recommendation system runs counter to the purpose of the DSA, which is to give users genuine autonomy, freedom of choice, and control over how information is presented to them.” The judge also concludes that the way Meta has designed its platforms constitutes “a significant disruption of the autonomy of Facebook and Instagram users.” The judge orders Meta to adjust its apps so that the user’s choice is preserved, even when the user navigates to another section or restarts the app.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We are pleased that the judge now makes clear that Meta must respect the user’s choice,” says Maartje Knaap, spokesperson for Bits of Freedom. “It is absolutely unacceptable that a handful of American tech billionaires determine how we see the world. That concentration of power poses a risk to our democracy. At the same time, it is regrettable that we need to go to court to ensure Meta complies with the law.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Meta has an interest in steering users toward a feed where it can show as many interest‑ and behavior‑based ads as possible. That is the core of Meta’s revenue model. Subtle design techniques push users toward that feed, while the non‑profiled feed is hidden behind a logo, making it hard to find. Users who do choose the alternative timeline also lose direct access to features such as Direct Messages. Moreover, when you open the app, it always starts with Meta’s feed, even if the user selected a different one before. Because of the judge’s ruling, Meta must change its behavior.</p>
<blockquote><p>“This ruling shows that Meta is not untouchable,” continues Maartje Knaap. “But we are also realistic, this is just a drop in the ocean. There’s still a long way to go. We hope the decision will inspire individuals, civil society organisations, regulators and lawmakers worldwide around the world who are working to rein in Meta’s power. Together we can stand up to a company that has become overwhelmingly powerful.”</p></blockquote>
