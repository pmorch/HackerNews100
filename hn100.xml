<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>Comment</span> Sanity appears to have prevailed in the debate over the UK Online Safety bill after the government agreed to ditch proposals - at least for the time being - to legislate the scanning of encrypted messages.</p>
<p>In response to questions regarding the technical feasibility of scanning messages and the assessments that Ofcom must make, Lord Parkinson, a Digital, Culture, Media and Sport minister, <a target="_blank" href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2023-09-06/debates/4AC6A32E-0C53-46C7-A714-AD4165C484D7/OnlineSafetyBill">said</a>: "If the appropriate technology does not exist that meets these requirements, then Ofcom will not be able to use Clause 122 to require its use."</p>
<p>Clause 122 in the Online Safety Bill relates to online terrorism and child exploitation content.</p>

    

<p>Parkinson said: "A notice can be issued only where technically feasible and where technology has been accredited as meeting minimum standards of accuracy."</p>

        


        

<p>Thus no scanning of encrypted messages unless it is technically feasible to do so. Quantum computing, anyone?</p>
<h3>Victory? Not so fast...</h3>
<p>The statements have been widely interpreted as a victory for technology firms, many of which had <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/04/28/online_safety_bill_age_checks/">threatened</a> to exit the UK over the requirement that it must be possible for encrypted messages to be scanned for illegal content.</p>
<p>However, it could also be argued that the changes only represent the bare minimum needed to get the bill across the line. The controversial clauses remain largely in place, with the buck passed to future administrations, or to when reading the messages becomes "technically feasible."</p>
<p>Matthew Hodgson, CEO of Element, said: "The government saying 'no scanning until it's technically feasible' is nonsense. Scanning is fundamentally incompatible with end-to-end encrypted messaging apps. Scanning bypasses the encryption in order to scan, exposing your messages to attackers."</p>

        

<p>He told <i>The Register</i> that the statement and the reaction from some section of the tech community left him terrified. “It’s not a win at all,” he said.</p>
<p>Hodgson continued: “the ministers must be feeling utterly smug… the pressure has been removed from them to change the bill and stop scanning, and they didn’t have to do anything”</p>
<p>“It's terrible because the law still says that scanning can be obligated on encrypted messaging providers, it would still undermine end to end encryption. And all it is [doing] is pushing it slightly down the line until somebody decides it's technically feasible, which is a completely subjective thing.”</p>

        

<p>Martina Larkin, CEO of Project Liberty, queried the thinking behind the clause and said: "No one is questioning that more must be done to protect people, especially children, online. However the debate should not be about protecting children versus protecting privacy. We can have, and should have, both."</p>
<p>"When it comes to how we build a better web, everybody loses when rash decisions are made. Trying to protect children by building backdoors into encryption will have unprecedented negative consequences for online privacy, the use of people's data as well as the protection of free speech and democratic values. No one would ever willingly let a complete stranger read all of your mail, put cameras in their house, and follow their every move. So why do it online?"</p>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/04/18/wrong_time_to_weaken_encryption/">Wrong time to weaken encryption, UK IT chartered institute tells government</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/04/21/meta_encryption_police/">International cops urge Meta <em>not</em> to implement secure encryption for all</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We'll draw a discreet veil over the devices with potential for surveillance supplied by large technology companies that people have indeed cheerfully installed in their houses. Still, both Larkin and Hodgson make excellent points.</p>
<p>A spokesperson from Index on Censorship said: "The Online Safety Bill as currently drafted is still a threat to encryption and as such puts at risk everyone from journalists working with whistleblowers to ordinary citizens talking in private. We need to see amendments urgently to protect our right to free speech online."</p>
<p>Attempts to paint the UK government's apparent climbdown as a victory for big tech is missing the point. At best, a skirmish might have been won and a ceasefire temporarily declared. However, the larger battle over privacy and encryption on the internet has yet to be fought. ®</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>exa</strong> is a modern replacement for the venerable file-listing command-line program <code>ls</code> that ships with Unix and Linux operating systems, giving it more features and better defaults.
It uses colours to distinguish file types and metadata.
It knows about symlinks, extended attributes, and Git.
And it’s <strong>small</strong>, <strong>fast</strong>, and just <strong>one single binary</strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto">By deliberately making some decisions differently, exa attempts to be a more featureful, more user-friendly version of <code>ls</code>.

</h2>
<p dir="auto">exa is written in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" rel="nofollow">Rust</a>.
You will need rustc version 1.66.1 or higher.
The recommended way to install Rust for development is from the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install" rel="nofollow">official download page</a>, using rustup.</p>
<p dir="auto">Once Rust is installed, you can compile exa with Cargo:</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">The <a href="https://github.com/casey/just">just</a> command runner can be used to run some helpful development commands, in a manner similar to <code>make</code>.
Run <code>just --list</code> to get an overview of what’s available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">If you are compiling a copy for yourself, be sure to run <code>cargo build --release</code> or <code>just build-release</code> to benefit from release-mode optimisations.
Copy the resulting binary, which will be in the <code>target/release</code> directory, into a folder in your <code>$PATH</code>.
<code>/usr/local/bin</code> is usually a good choice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">To compile and install the manual pages, you will need <a href="https://pandoc.org/" rel="nofollow">pandoc</a>.
The <code>just man</code> command will compile the Markdown into manual pages, which it will place in the <code>target/man</code> directory.
To use them, copy them into a directory that <code>man</code> will read.
<code>/usr/local/share/man</code> is usually a good choice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">exa depends on <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/git2-rs">libgit2</a> for certain features.
If you’re unable to compile libgit2, you can opt out of Git support by running <code>cargo build --no-default-features</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">If you intend to compile for musl, you will need to use the flag <code>vendored-openssl</code> if you want to get the Git feature working.
The full command is <code>cargo build --release --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-musl --features vendored-openssl,git</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">For more information, see the <a href="https://the.exa.website/install/source" rel="nofollow">Building from Source page</a>.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Testing with Vagrant</h3>
<p dir="auto">exa uses <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/" rel="nofollow">Vagrant</a> to configure virtual machines for testing.</p>
<p dir="auto">Programs such as exa that are basically interfaces to the system are <a href="https://eev.ee/blog/2016/08/22/testing-for-people-who-hate-testing/#troublesome-cases" rel="nofollow">notoriously difficult to test</a>.
Although the internal components have unit tests, it’s impossible to do a complete end-to-end test without mandating the current user’s name, the time zone, the locale, and directory structure to test.
(And yes, these tests are worth doing. I have missed an edge case on many an occasion.)</p>
<p dir="auto">The initial attempt to solve the problem was just to create a directory of “awkward” test cases, run exa on it, and make sure it produced the correct output.
But even this output would change if, say, the user’s locale formats dates in a different way.
These can be mocked inside the code, but at the cost of making that code more complicated to read and understand.</p>
<p dir="auto">An alternative solution is to fake <em>everything</em>: create a virtual machine with a known state and run the tests on <em>that</em>.
This is what Vagrant does.
Although it takes a while to download and set up, it gives everyone the same development environment to test for any obvious regressions.</p>
<p dir="auto">First, initialise the VM:</p>

<p dir="auto">The first command downloads the virtual machine image, and then runs our provisioning script, which installs Rust and exa’s build-time dependencies, configures the environment, and generates some awkward files and folders to use as test cases.
Once this is done, you can SSH in, and build and test:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="host$ vagrant ssh
vm$ cd /vagrant
vm$ cargo build
vm$ ./xtests/run
All the tests passed!"><pre><code>host$ vagrant ssh
vm$ cd /vagrant
vm$ cargo build
vm$ ./xtests/run
All the tests passed!
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Of course, the drawback of having a standard development environment is that you stop noticing bugs that occur outside of it.
For this reason, Vagrant isn’t a <em>necessary</em> development step — it’s there if you’d like to use it, but exa still gets used and tested on other platforms.
It can still be built and compiled on any target triple that it supports, VM or no VM, with <code>cargo build</code> and <code>cargo test</code>.</p>

    Someone keeps trying to reset my facebook password.   I keep getting these "account recovery code" emails.  They're legit.
  </p><p>
    Whoever is doing apparently doesn't have access to my email, though, as  they keep doing it and when I check logins, I only see the devices that I have with me logged in.
  </p><p>
    Is there a way I can find out who is doing this?   Or at least get an IP address of the login attempts
  </p><p>
    I want to know if this is really someone trying to steal my account, or if it's just a Facebook-connected app that I have exhibiting some kind of bizarre bug.
  </p><p>
    I've already turned on 2FA (already had it on before this, but only with text messages, I added the Authenticator app as well)
  </p><p>
    I also went ahead and actually changed my password (NOT a password reset, changed it from within account settings) , just because good security practices.
  </p><p>
    It's annoying that this is happening, but since the security measures I already had in place have defeated these attempts,  not dire.   Still, really annoying.
  </p><p>
    I've tried searching for a way to disable password reset attempts,  but the Facebook article about it just redirects back to itself.
  </p><p>
    .
  </p><p>
    Anyone have any insights?  A way to stop this?    I don't just want to mark the reset emails as spam, what if I really need to reset my password at some point?

<p>After 3 years, the new world record was set by installing LoRaWAN trackers on a fishing boat <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.vesselfinder.com/?imo=8797219">Estrela de Sesimbra</a> and on its buoys on the Sesimbra coast, Portugal.

    <p>SIGGRAPH 2023 just had a paper “<a href="https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/"><strong>3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Radiance Field Rendering</strong></a>”
by Kerbl, Kopanas, Leimkühler, Drettakis, and it looks
pretty cool! Check out their website, source code repository, data sets and so on (I should note that
it is <em>really, really good</em> to see full source and full data sets being released. Way to go!).</p>
<p>I’ve decided to try to implement the realtime visualization part (i.e. the one that takes
already-produced gaussian splat “model” file) in Unity. As well as maybe play around with looking at
whether the data sizes could be made smaller (maybe use some of the learnings from
<a href="https://aras-p.info/blog/2023/01/29/Float-Compression-0-Intro/">float compression series</a> too?).</p>
<p><a href="https://aras-p.info/img/blog/2023/gaussian-splat/gs-bike-initial.jpg"><img src="https://aras-p.info/img/blog/2023/gaussian-splat/gs-bike-initial.jpg" title="" alt="" width="300px"></a>
<em>What’s a few million badly rendered boxes among friends, anyway?</em></p>
<p>For the impatient: I got <em>something</em> working over at <a href="https://github.com/aras-p/UnityGaussianSplatting">aras-p/UnityGaussianSplatting</a>, and will tinker with things there some more.</p>
<p><em>Meanwhile, some quick random thoughts on this Gaussian Splatting thing.</em></p>
<h4 id="what-are-these-gaussian-splats">What are these Gaussian Splats?</h4>
<p>Watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_kXY43VZnk"><strong>paper video</strong></a> and read
<a href="https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/">the paper</a>, they are pretty good!</p>

<p>
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T_kXY43VZnk" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</p>

<p>I have seen quite many 3rd party explanations of the concept at this point, and some of them, uhh, get a thing or
two wrong about it :)</p>
<ul>
<li>This is <em><strong>not</strong></em> a NeRF (Neural Radiance Field)! There is absolutely nothing “neural” about it.</li>
<li>It is <em><strong>not</strong></em> somehow “fast, because it uses GPU rasterization hardware”. The official implementation does not
use the rasterization pipeline at all; it is 100% done with CUDA. In fact, it is fast <em>because</em> it does not use
the fixed function rasterization, as we’ll see below.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Anyway,</em></p>
<p>Gaussian Splats are, basically, “<strong>a bunch of blobs in space</strong>”. Instead of representing a 3D scene as
polygonal meshes, or voxels, or distance fields, it represents it as (millions of) particles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each particle (“a 3D Gaussian”) has position, rotation and a non-uniform scale in 3D space.</li>
<li>Each particle also has an opacity, as well as color (actually, not a single color, but rather
3rd order Spherical Harmonics coefficients - meaning “the color” can change depending on the view direction).</li>
<li>For rendering, the particles are rendered (“splatted”) as <em>2D Gaussians</em> in screen space, i.e. they
are <em>not</em> rendered as scaled elongated spheres, actually! More on this below.</li>
</ul>
<p>And <em>that’s it</em>. The “Gaussian Splatting” scene representation is <em>just that</em>, a whole bunch of scaled and colored
blobs in space. The genius part of the paper is several things:</p>
<ul>
<li>They found a way <strong>how</strong> to create these millions of blobs that would represent a scene depicted by a bunch of
photos. This is using gradient descent and “differentiable rendering” and all the other things that are way
over my head. This <em>feels</em> like the major contribution, like maybe previously people assumed that in order
for gradient descent optimizer to work nicely, you need to use a continuous or connected scene representation (vs
“just a bunch of blobs”), and this paper proved that wrong? <em>Anyway, I don’t understand this area, so I won’t talk
about it more :)</em></li>
<li>They have developed a fast way to render all these millions of scaled particles. This by itself is not particularly
ground breaking IMHO, various people have noticed that using something like a tile-based “software, but on GPU”
rasterizer is a good way to do this.</li>
<li>They have combined existing established approaches (like gaussian splatting, and spherical harmonics)
in a nice way.</li>
<li>And finally, they have resisted the temptation to do “neural” anything ;)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="previous-building-blocks">Previous Building Blocks</h4>
<p>The <strong>Gaussian Splatting</strong> seems to be invented around year 2001-2002, see for example “<a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~zwicker/publications/EWASplatting-TVCG02.pdf">EWA Splatting</a>” paper by Zwicker, Pfister, Van Baar, Gross.
There they have scaled and oriented “blobs” in space, calculate how would they project onto screen, and then
do the actual “blob shape” (a “Gaussian”) in 2D, in screen-space. A bunch of signal processing, sampling, aliasing etc.
math presumably supports doing it that way.</p>
<p>Speaking of ellipsoids, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnOXk3QJWN8">Ecstatica game</a> from 1994 had a fairly
unique ellipsoid-based renderer.</p>
<p><strong>Spherical Harmonics</strong> (a way to represent a function over a surface of a sphere) have been around for several hundred
years in physics, but really were popularized in computer graphics around 2000 by Ravi Ramamoorthi and
Peter-Pike Sloan. But actually, a 1992 “Predicting Reflectance Functions from Complex Surfaces” paper by Westin, Arvo,
Torrance might be the first use of them in graphics.</p>
<p><strong>Point-Based Rendering</strong> in various forms has been around for a long time, e.g. particle systems were used since
“forever” (but typically used for vfx / non-solid phenomena).
“<a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~zwicker/projectpages/Surfels-SIG00.html">Surfels</a>” paper is from 2000. Something closer
to my heart, a whole bunch of demoscene demos are using non-traditional rendering approaches. Fairlight &amp; CNCD
have several notable examples, e.g.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VhecrFsZjc">Agenda Circling Forth</a> (2010),
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaPPHUt4K34">Ceasefire (all falls down..)</a> (2010),
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyXwmt0EZig">Number One / Another One</a> (2018):</p>

<p>
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-VhecrFsZjc" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</p>

<p>Real-time VFX tools like <a href="https://www.notch.one/">Notch</a> have pretty extensive features for creating, simulating
and displaying point/blob based “things”.</p>
<p>Ideas of representing images or scenes with a bunch of “primitive shapes”, as well as tools to generate those, have
been around too. E.g. <a href="https://github.com/fogleman/primitive">fogleman/primitive</a> (2016) is nice.</p>
<p>Media Molecule “Dreams” has a splat-based renderer (I think the shipped version is not purely splat-based
but a combination of several techniques). Check out the most excellent “Learning from Failure” talk by Alex Evans:
at <a href="https://advances.realtimerendering.com/s2015/#_TESSELLATION_IN_CALL">SIGGRAPH 2015</a> (splats start at slide 109)
or video from <a href="https://youtu.be/u9KNtnCZDMI?t=1354">Umbra Ignite 2015</a> (splats start at 22:34).</p>

<p>
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u9KNtnCZDMI" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</p>

<p><strong>Tiled Rasterization</strong> for particles has been around at least since 2014 (<a href="https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/GPUParticles11">“Holy smoke! Faster Particle Rendering
using Direct Compute”</a> by Gareth Thomas). And the idea
that dividing screen into tiles, doing a bunch of things “inside the tile” thus cutting on memory traffic,
is how <em>entire</em> mobile GPU space operates, and has been operating since “forever”, tracing back to first PowerVR
designs (1996) and even Pixel Planes 5 from 1989.</p>
<p>This is all <em>great</em>! Taking existing, developed, solid building blocks and combining them in a novel way is excellent
work.</p>
<h4 id="my-toy-playground">My Toy Playground</h4>
<p>My current implementation (of just the visualizer of Gaussian Splat models) for Unity is over at github:
<a href="https://github.com/aras-p/UnityGaussianSplatting"><strong>aras-p/UnityGaussianSplatting</strong></a>. Current state is “it kinda
works, but it is not fast”:</p>

<p>So all of that could be improved and optimized quite a bit!</p>
<p>One thing I haven’t seen talked much about, by everyone <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbXmGgJePsk">super excited</a>
about Gaussian Splats, is data size and memory usage. Yeah, rendering is nice, but this bicycle scene above is
1.5GB of data on-disk, and then at runtime it needs some more (for sorting, tile based rendering etc.).
That scene is six million blobs in space, with each of them taking about 250 bytes. There has to be some
way to make that smaller! Actually the Dreams talk above has some neat ideas.</p>
<p><em>Maybe I should play around with that. Someday!</em></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>In the annals of infrastructure investing,  Chicago is best known for getting fleeced in a notorious parking meter deal under ex-Mayor Richard M. Daley. We regret to report that short of declaring bankruptcy, the city is more stuck than ever with this ball-and-chain agreement for decades to come.</p><p>The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals earlier this month <a href="http://media.ca7.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/OpinionsWeb/processWebInputExternal.pl?Submit=Display&amp;Path=Y2023/D04-07/C:22-1166:J:Wood:aut:T:fnOp:N:3027710:S:0">affirmed</a> the deal with Chicago Parking Meters LLC, known as CPM, the private company that profits outrageously from Daley’s folly. The judges upheld the dismissal of a lawsuit brought by Chicago motorists who said the deal created a price-gouging monopoly that violates federal law aimed at preserving competitive markets.</p><p>The lawsuit claimed the deal left the city with no real control over on-street meters, and stymied efforts to expand public transit, create bike lanes or otherwise respond to changing times in any way that would interfere with the flow of meter money to CPM. Chicago, the suit alleged, had become a puppet of the investors, unable to act in the public interest without financial penalties that made action unaffordable and therefore impossible.</p><p>Alas, the appellate judges made mincemeat of that argument. While the deal “might have been foolish, short-sighted or worse,” the court said, perhaps employing some irony Chicago was within its rights to undertake the giveaway, and still retains enough regulatory authority to put a kibosh on the lawsuit’s monopoly claim.</p><p>So much for a creative legal effort to win back some leverage on behalf of the suckers otherwise known as Chicago’s citizens.</p><p>The deal came about in 2008, as Daley and the City Council — whose lapdog aldermen were the real puppets in this case — sought to close a budget shortfall. After due diligence so cursory as to not deserve the name, Chicago agreed to sell a 75-year lease on its parking meter system for just $1.16 billion. Within a few years, the city had spent that money, and sharply jacked up parking rates, as required in the deal. The investors, meantime, recouped their original outlay within a decade, and made millions in additional profits with much more still to come.</p><section aria-roledescription="carousel" aria-label="Tribune cartoonist’s decadeslong critique of Chicago’s parking meter deal" id="gallery_div_SBGRPPKBBBHRVAIZDWOV5RYN3M"><div id="gallery-images-SBGRPPKBBBHRVAIZDWOV5RYN3M" data-image-id="BMDKTNGVOBFTXLQH2N6QO7GPBI" role="group" aria-roledescription="slide" aria-label="1 of 6" aria-hidden="false" aria-live="polite"><picture><source srcset="https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/Z3g2j7RIg9rhQEVhCXqQIohPEso=/800x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/BMDKTNGVOBFTXLQH2N6QO7GPBI.jpg" media="screen and (min-width: 996px)"><source srcset="https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/vXKsPm3hnqeRexSSNLeyw52d4hE=/600x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/BMDKTNGVOBFTXLQH2N6QO7GPBI.jpg" media="screen and (min-width: 768px)"><source srcset="https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/4FayPcSsndL9sNyroFHEbU_FAfE=/400x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/BMDKTNGVOBFTXLQH2N6QO7GPBI.jpg" media="screen and (min-width: 0px)"><img src="https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/Z3g2j7RIg9rhQEVhCXqQIohPEso=/800x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/BMDKTNGVOBFTXLQH2N6QO7GPBI.jpg" data-lightbox="https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/_UhDmrInS4XRfhAoV6sKyKW6Dag=/1600x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/BMDKTNGVOBFTXLQH2N6QO7GPBI.jpg" width="800" height="0" loading="eager"></picture></div><p><span>After the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the deal with Chicago Parking Meters LLC, the city is more stuck than ever with this ball-and-chain parking meter deal. </span>(Scott Stantis/For the Chicago Tribune)</p></section><p>The investors were fiendishly clever in guaranteeing their interests. Under the contract, the city must maintain at least 30,000 meters in any given year, according to the 7th Circuit ruling. With a few trivial exceptions, if the city cuts parking fees, reduces the number of spaces or the hours of operation, or even just fails to keep up with inflation, it is obliged to pay CPM for “lost” revenue.</p><p>After those so-called true-up payments became a political scandal in 2013, ex-Mayor Rahm Emanuel amended and reapproved the contract, further binding the city to it. As it stands, Chicago has paid more than $150 million in true-ups to CPM, according to the court’s ruling, and there’s every reason to expect it will be paying more in the future.</p><p>This is where we thought the lawsuit made a very good point. While Chicago has the authority to set parking rates and revise the number and location of meters, those powers are toothless, as the lawsuit said, because the city can’t use them freely without paying a fortune to its CPM overlords.</p><p>The court didn’t see it that way. The city has shown it still regulates its parking by, for instance, adding meters in new zones that are treated differently from those covered under the deal. “The fact that the city pays a price for certain actions cannot be enough to undermine the whole concession,” the court found. “Regulation is possible even if the city must conduct a cost-benefit analysis before it takes a given step.”</p><p>Benefits? What benefits?</p><p>Well, the original check didn’t bounce. CPM paid the $1.16 billion upfront, temporarily saving Daley and his henchmen from making budget cuts or raising taxes while enabling them, in typical Illinois fashion, to kick financial obligations down the road.</p><p>CPM also agreed to some changes in 2013 that made the deal <a href="https://www.metroplanning.org/work/project/29/subpage/3?utm_source=%2fparking&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=redirect&amp;RedirectReferrer=https%3a%2f%2fwww.google.com%2f">slightly less terrible</a> for the city. Plus, it invested a substantial sum (though nowhere near its profits to date) in replacing old-fashioned coin meters with electronic ones, updating the system for mobile apps and handling payments. The system works efficiently, at least compared with those in other cities that haven’t updated their meters.</p><p>But the cost!</p><p>Way back in 2009, Chicago’s <a href="http://dig.abclocal.go.com/wls/documents/060209parkingmeter.pdf">inspector general</a> confirmed that the city had sold out for far less than the lease’s value. A report by Bloomberg Business said CPM stood to earn about <i>10 times</i> what it paid over the life of the contract. Any way you slice it financially, Chicago got taken to the cleaners.</p><div id="news_letter_div"><p><img src="https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/_j7aoDIYkhkbQAu2Gz60E2VD_qw=/84x84/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/PGWZQSUOSVFADASMRE3G2YHBKY.jpg" width="84" height="84"></p><div><p><h3>Chicago Tribune Opinion</h3></p><p>Weekdays</p><p>Read the latest editorials and commentary curated by the Tribune Opinion team.</p></div></div><p>Worse still, the deal makes it harder for Chicago to get greener and otherwise change with the times.

The deal also complicated Chicago’s pandemic response, so, yes, it’s bad for public health too.</p><p>We wish we had better news, but at least there’s this: Can we all agree that Chicago must never, never, <i>never </i>let another parking meter deal happen?</p><p>The next time an arrogant mayor tries to ram through a megabucks contract lasting damn-near forever with no real analysis, remember the parking deal!</p><p>We have a message for the CPM investors too.

<p><i>This is currently a small-scale beta project.</i>
</p>

<p><b>Wikimedia DNS</b> (formerly called <b>Wikidough</b>), is a caching, recursive, public <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_HTTPS" title="en:DNS over HTTPS">DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH)</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_TLS" title="en:DNS over TLS">DNS-over-TLS (DoT)</a> resolver service that is run and managed by the Site Reliability Engineering (Traffic) team at the Foundation. Wikimedia DNS helps prevent some surveillance and censorship of our wikis and other websites by securing DNS lookups.
</p><p>This document outlines what the service is about, why the SRE/Traffic team is working on it, and what benefits it provides for the Wikimedia community. We welcome any discussions about this project on the talk page.

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System" title="en:Domain Name System">Domain Name System</a> (DNS) is the phonebook of the internet. It provides a lookup of domain names (such as wikipedia.org) to their IP addresses (<code>208.80.154.224</code>). Whenever you visit a resource on the internet like a website, a DNS resolver — typically run by your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/en:Internet_service_provider" title="w:en:Internet service provider">Internet Service Provider</a> (ISP) — resolves the domain to an IP address and is the first step in the creation of a connection to a website. Without the IP address you won't be able to find the right website. This process happens in the background and because of the way the internet works, most people automatically connect to their ISP's DNS resolver to perform these DNS queries.
</p><p>DNS is a critical part of the internet and DNS lookups happen regardless of which resource you want to access or where you access it from (mobile or phone).
</p>
<h3><span id="DNS-based_surveillance_and_censorship" data-mw-thread-id="h-DNS-based_surveillance_and_censorship-Introduction_to_DNS"><span data-mw-comment-start="" id="h-DNS-based_surveillance_and_censorship-Introduction_to_DNS"></span>DNS-based surveillance and censorship<span data-mw-comment-end="h-DNS-based_surveillance_and_censorship-Introduction_to_DNS"></span></span><span><span>[</span><a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikimedia_DNS&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3" title="Edit section: DNS-based surveillance and censorship">edit</a><span>]</span></span></h3>
<p>Even though DNS has been around for decades, a DNS query (<i>what is the IP address of wikipedia.org?</i>) and the response (<i>the IP address is 208.80.154.224</i>) are not encrypted. This is a significant privacy and security risk. An on-path observer — such as your coffee shop, ISP, or your government — can observe your DNS queries/responses and build a list of the resources you access on the internet, and perhaps worse, censor you by preventing access to content they deem unacceptable.
</p><p>Since we are primarily concerned with censorship in the context of the movement, Wikipedia and other Wikimedia projects have been censored through DNS and this has been observed in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://explorer.ooni.org/">various countries</a> where we are active. DNS censorship is easy to implement, scales effectively, and also since DNS is the first step in the connection to a remote resource, most ISPs and governments use DNS censorship to prevent people from accessing content on the internet. 
</p><p>As an example, censoring queries for <i>*.wikipedia.org</i> to prevent people from accessing any language edition of Wikipedia is trivial to implement in most DNS resolver software and is a one-line change.

<p>To solve the problem of surveillance and censorship of DNS, various DNS encryption protocols have been proposed over the years. Due to various reasons including a lack of a standard, adaptability, implementation, none of the proposed protocols have seen mass adoption until DNS-over-HTTPS was <a rel="nofollow" href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8484">proposed and standardized</a> in 2018. The Mozilla Firefox browser helped push adoption of DoH by enabling it by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/firefox/firefox-continues-push-to-bring-dns-over-https-by-default-for-us-users/">default for US users in 2020</a> and has since rolled this out to other countries as well.

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_HTTPS" title="en:DNS over HTTPS">DNS-over-HTTPS</a>, also called DoH, encrypts DNS by sending queries and getting responses over HTTPS, thus preventing censorship and surveillance: because an on-path observer can no longer see the queries or the responses, they cannot censor it or build a profile of the data. DoH works by sending DNS queries over a secure HTTPS channel.
</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_TLS" title="en:DNS over TLS">DNS-over-TLS</a>, also called DoT, is a related DNS encryption protocol offering encryption over just TLS. It hasn't seen the same rate of adoption DNS-over-HTTPS has seen for various reasons that we will discuss later. Nevertheless, we consider both of these protocols related for the purpose of this discussion and the Wikimedia DNS service, even though there are differences between them at the protocol level.

<p>Wikimedia DNS is a public DNS-over-HTTPS and DNS-over-TLS resolver service. For users who wish to secure their DNS lookups to prevent surveillance or to circumvent DNS-based censorship, Wikimedia DNS helps protect your DNS queries/responses by providing encryption of the same. For a user securing their DNS lookups via Wikimedia DNS, all that an on-path observer or a censor can see is a connection to the Wikimedia DNS service but not the content of the DNS queries or responses.

<p>The SRE/Traffic team in the Wikimedia Foundation is tasked with running the Wikimedia proxy servers and data centers. We are also interested in understanding where and how our websites are censored on a technical level. HTTPS makes it impossible for censors to block access to specific articles, thus forcing them to choose between blocking nothing or the entire website. We are not concerned with censorship of the content of the articles — even though that's related — but rather the website/ecosystem as a whole.
</p><p>In studying and researching censorship of Foundation websites, we discovered that the most common form of this censorship was through filtering the DNS. The idea of running a secure, encrypted DNS service thus stemmed from those observations. The annual plan for FY 2022–23, under its <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Foundation_Annual_Plan/2023-2024/Goals/Safety_%26_Inclusion#Disinformation" title="metawiki:Wikimedia Foundation Annual Plan/2023-2024/Goals/Safety &amp; Inclusion">goal for Safety and Inclusion</a>, talks about "Implement technical improvements to strengthen security and privacy of volunteers on-wiki, protect against surveillance, and enhance the communities' ability to effectively govern themselves and address disinformation and human rights risks."

<p>We cannot recommend external resolver services such as those run by Google, Cloudflare, Quad9, among others, for a variety of reasons. We have no control over how these services are run or what private data is logged. Even though most of these services have explicit privacy policies, they do log some data and we have no control or insight into that. 
</p><p>Furthermore, some of these services use content filtering. Cloudflare's DNS service for families has been <a rel="nofollow" href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-mistake-that-caused-1-1-1-3-to-block-lgbtqia-sites-today/">caught blocking LGBTQ content</a>. Other services indulge in various forms of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.quad9.net/service/threat-blocking/">content filtering</a> as well.
</p><p>The SRE team is well poised to run such a service and can provide a reliable alternative to secure DNS resolver services run by for-profit corporations.

<p>No. While DNS protocols such as DoH and DoT encrypt DNS queries between your client (like Firefox) and a resolver (Wikimedia DNS), an on-path observer (such as your ISP/government) can still identify which websites you are connecting to through the SNI field in the ClientHello message (currently unencrypted) or the IP address of the website. Nevertheless, given that DNS-based censorship and surveillance is often the easiest to implement, securing your DNS is a good first step towards improving your privacy and resisting censorship.
</p><p>The <a rel="nofollow" href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tls-esni/">Encrypted Client Hello extension</a> (ECH; formerly called Encrypted SNI) to TLSv1.3 encrypts the SNI field and because of how it works, ECH requires encrypted DNS to be effective. Coupled together and once properly deployed, these two technologies will help address long-standing issues with privacy of users on the internet. While this doesn't solve all our issues, we also need encrypted DNS for future work against surveillance and censorship to be effective.

<p>Yes, a censor can just block Wikimedia DNS. But we believe that coupling encrypted DNS with Encrypted Client Hello (that depends on encrypted DNS) is going to make the blocking of websites more difficult, thus helping minimize the possibility of blocking Wikimedia DNS because censors will no longer be able to see the SNI for it. Additionally, most censors don't typically block DNS resolvers, as observed by the prevalence and usage of <code>1.1.1.1</code> and <code>8.8.8.8</code>.
</p><p>Wikimedia DNS is not a complete solution to all censorship issues. It is just one part of our strategy in fighting against censorship and while it might not help protect all users everywhere, it will help secure DNS lookups for the vast majority of them and help lay the foundation for upcoming protocols.

<p>Let's assume you want to connect to <i>en.wikipedia.org</i>. The first step is the DNS resolution, so a DNS resolver will give you back the IP address of en.wiki for you to create a connection to it. The next stage in that process is that when you want to connect to the IP address, you have to specify the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication" title="en:Server Name Indication">server name indication</a></i> or the SNI as well, which in this case is <i>en.wikipedia.org</i>. This SNI field, like DNS, has been unencrypted so far and a censor that has the capabilities to inspect your traffic can see that you are connecting to en.wiki and prevent you from making that connection. 
</p><p>SNI-based censorship is the most common form of restricting access to websites (not just ours) after DNS, the difference being that it requires more resources in the form of specialized blocking equipment that does deep-packet inspection on the traffic so not every censor is motivated to pursue it or has the equipment to be able to do so.
</p><p>Encrypted Client Hello (formerly called Encrypted Server Name Indication or ESNI), encrypts this SNI field, preventing a censor from blocking traffic based on the SNI field. ECH depends on encrypted DNS to be effective as the key distribution for ECH happens over DNS HTTPS resource records. In the absence of encrypted DNS, a censor could simply filter or poison the DNS result, making ECH ineffective. The Firefox browser for example will <a rel="nofollow" href="https://groups.google.com/a/mozilla.org/g/dev-platform/c/uv7PNrHUagA/m/BNA4G8fOAAAJ">not enable ECH if encrypted DNS is also not enabled</a>.
</p><p>Thus the work on Wikimedia DNS not only secures DNS but also lays the foundation for future implementations of internet security protocols such as ECH.

<p>No. Using Wikimedia DNS does not relay the contents of the communication and does not change the IP address of a user. It only secures the metadata, which in this case is the DNS lookup.

<p>Running a VPN service requires a lot more resources and carries with a lot more liability, as we would be relaying the contents of the transmission as well, not just the metadata.
</p><p>There are also usability and accessibility issues with VPNs. Those who know what VPNs are and can configure them will use them whereas most other users won't be able to do that. Thus if we are offering a censorship circumvention tool, it should work for everyone and while we are not there with DoH or DoT yet, those protocols are more standardized and easier to use than setting up and running a VPN client.

<p>Yes, Wikimedia DNS, just like another DNS service (and even the one run by your ISP), can allow bad actors to perform DNS resolution and to secure their DNS lookups. Note that Wikimedia DNS just provides the metadata for the communication (the <i>phone number</i>) but it is not involved in the actual communication itself (the <i>phone call</i>). Thus the utility Wikimedia DNS provides to bad actors is quite limited when they have better tools available to secure the contents of the communication itself, such as the many free and commercial VPN services or other proxies.
</p><p>Wikimedia DNS is an alternative to already available commercial DNS providers and is not the only such service. Most people will still use Google and Cloudflare to secure their DNS lookups because these services will be much faster than ours because of the scale at which they operate.

<p>Wikimedia DNS supports DoH on TCP/443 and DoT on TCP/853. Users can select either protocol to secure their DNS as both DoH and DoT share the same privacy and security guarantees within Wikimedia DNS, but users are reminded to be mindful of the differences between the protocols themselves. 
</p>
<ul><li>DoH running on port 443 makes it harder for it to be blocked as censors would have to block potentially all HTTPS traffic. DoT runs on a dedicated port, 853, thus making it easier to block.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Typically, DoH support is in the browser (thus securing DNS lookups only from within that browser), while DoT lookups happen at the OS level, for all applications. DoT might be more preferable in that sense unless censorship is an issue.</li></ul>

<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">A tool for running large language models on-premises using non-public
data</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>OnPrem.LLM</strong> is a simple Python package that makes it easier to run
large language models (LLMs) on non-public or sensitive data and on
machines with no internet connectivity (e.g., behind corporate
firewalls). Inspired by the
<a href="https://github.com/imartinez/privateGPT">privateGPT</a> GitHub repo and
Simon Willison’s <a href="https://pypi.org/project/llm/" rel="nofollow">LLM</a> command-line
utility, <strong>OnPrem.LLM</strong> is designed to help integrate local LLMs into
practical applications.</p>

<p dir="auto">By default, a 7B-parameter model is used. If <code>use_larger=True</code>, a
13B-parameter is used. You can also supply the URL to an LLM of your
choosing to <a href="https://amaiya.github.io/onprem/core.html#llm" rel="nofollow"><code>LLM</code></a> (see
code generation section below for an example). Currently, only models in
GGML format are supported. Future versions of <strong>OnPrem.LLM</strong> will

The function returns `True` if the email address is valid, and `False` otherwise. The code also includes some test examples to demonstrate how to use the function."><pre><code>Here is an example of Python code that can be used to validate an email address:

In February 2020, the world began to panic about the novel coronavirus, which killed 2714 people that month. This made the news. In the same month, around 800,000 people died from the effects of air pollution. That didn’t. Novelty counts for a lot. At the start of the pandemic, it was considered unseemly to make comparisons like these. But comparing the value of human lives is one thing the machine of modern civilisation does relentlessly, almost invariably to prioritise and absolve the rich – when, for example, the global supply of Covid vaccines is apportioned primarily to the highest-income countries, or when the cost of natural disasters in Bangladesh is measured against the impact of sea-level rise on Miami Beach real estate, or when Joe Biden’s onetime economic adviser Lawrence Summers proposed that Africa, as a whole, was ‘vastly underpolluted’, and suggested that ‘the economic logic behind dumping a whole load of toxic waste in the lowest wage country is impeccable.’</p><p>In its first year, the pandemic did damage according to the opposite logic, with the world’s wealthiest countries the worst hit. When people in those countries tried to diminish the threat of the virus by comparing it to the flu, the disease made a joke of them. But air pollution kills more than ten times as many as the flu every single year, and we hear even less about it. In 2017, a <em>Lancet</em> study put the figure at almost seven million a year, about two-thirds from outside air pollution and one-third from indoor, household pollution. More recent estimates run higher, with as many as 8.7 million deaths every year attributable just to the outdoor particulate matter produced from burning fossil fuels. Add on indoor pollution, and you get an annual toll of more than ten million. That’s more than four times the official worldwide death toll from Covid last year. It’s about twenty times as many as the current annual deaths from war, murder and terrorism combined. Put another way, air pollution kills twenty thousand on an average day, more than have died in the aftermath of all the meltdowns in the history of nuclear power: Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, Fukushima and all the others put together. If the pandemic so terrified us that billions of us retreated into panicked cocoons for months, what can explain or justify our blindness and indifference towards the ten million lives ended each year by the repeated inhalation of smog?</p><p>Ten million deaths a year is a hundred million a decade. The numbers are so large that even the superlatives of disaster fail. They’re so large that they strain credulity, perhaps partly because none of us can picture someone dying in the street from air pollution and partly because it seems pathetically old-fashioned for a doctor to advise a sojourn in healthier air. But the chances are that you can’t picture a death from obesity or cigarette smoking either, and yet you probably don’t doubt estimates of their toll on human wellbeing, or think it wrong to call Louisiana’s River Parishes ‘Cancer Alley’ – the presence of 150 petrochemical plants has made it an incontrovertibly unhealthy place to live, with some communities registering cancer rates fifty times the national average. Such areas are sometimes known as ‘sacrifice zones’.</p><p>A single speck of black carbon, inhaled, won’t stop the heart or poison the lungs, but over time, across populations, the effect is devastating. When we talk about death we always want to see a murderer. When there isn’t one, it’s a lot harder to call it a murder, rather than a tragedy or an act of God. (‘You see one person run over in the street and you’ll never forget it,’ an environmentalist observes in <em>Choked: The Age of Air Pollution and the Fight for a Cleaner Future</em>.<span><a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v43/n23/footnotes/ten-million-a-year-footnote-2">*</a></span> Thousands dying from the effects of dirty air ‘will never even faze you’.) But the central premise of any mortality model is that everyone dies: the question is when, and whether a certain behaviour or environmental factor hastened that end. And while none of these estimates is meant to suggest a single cause of mortality, such as a gunshot wound or a dose of poison in your morning tea, the calculus for air pollution is the same as for obesity or smoking: take the problem away, and the number of premature deaths will fall by many millions. According to new research, half of these deaths, concentrated in the developing world, are the result of consumption and fossil-fuel burning in the world’s richest countries.</p><p>The environmental historian Stephen Pyne calls our era the ‘pyrocene’, a global regime of burning: coal and oil, agricultural land and forest, bush and wetland, most of it planned. The Anthropocene, Pyne says, implies dominion over nature. He prefers to emphasise the fact that, wherever you look, the earth is in flames. The residue is carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, black carbon, sulphur dioxide, and the particularly toxic grouping of small particulate matter known as PM2.5. Everything we burn, we breathe.</p><p>Hundreds of millions of people live and breathe in cities permanently clouded by airborne toxic events. In November, the authorities in Delhi closed schools and colleges indefinitely, suspended construction work, and shuttered half of the local coal plants after an episode of ‘toxic smog’ and an order from the Indian Supreme Court to institute emergency measures to combat it. The smog wasn’t new; the response was. Throughout the city, particulate matter hangs around in offices, lobbies and private homes, even those with air purifiers. It often gets so thick that it interferes with air travel. More remarkably, it has interrupted train travel, the smog making it impossible for drivers to see the tracks. Taxi drivers have filtration systems to process the particulates that sneak in. Pedestrians can’t escape it, which is one reason that, on especially smoggy days, living in Delhi is the equivalent of smoking several packets of cigarettes. The city has the highest rates of respiratory illness in the world, and 60 per cent of inhabitants diagnosed with COPD – chronic obstructive pulmonary disease – aren’t even smokers.</p><p>Across India as a whole, where more than a million people die from air pollution each year, exposure to small particulate matter has been estimated at five times the World Health Organisation’s longtime ‘safe’ level – defined as ten micrograms per cubic metre of air. This year the WHO set a new standard, at half the old level. Under the old threshold, 90 per cent of the world’s population were breathing dangerously polluted air; under the new threshold the figure is closer to 99 per cent. Of the world’s fourteen most polluted metropolises, only one (Hotan in China) is outside India. Of the 336 cities that come next on the list, 184 are in China. But this isn’t to say that air pollution is a problem in just two countries. Globally, it causes one death in five.</p><p>Here is just a partial list of the things, short of death rates, we know are affected by air pollution. GDP, with a 10 per cent increase in pollution reducing output by almost a full percentage point, according to an OECD report last year. Cognitive performance, with a study showing that cutting Chinese pollution to the standards required in the US would improve the average student’s ranking in verbal tests by 26 per cent and in maths by 13 per cent. In Los Angeles, after $700 air purifiers were installed in schools, student performance improved almost as much as it would if class sizes were reduced by a third. Heart disease is more common in polluted air, as are many types of cancer, and acute and chronic respiratory diseases like asthma, and strokes. The incidence of Alzheimer’s can triple: in <em>Choked</em>, Beth Gardiner cites a study which found early markers of Alzheimer’s in 40 per cent of autopsies conducted on those in high-pollution areas and in none of those outside them. Rates of other sorts of dementia increase too, as does Parkinson’s. Air pollution has also been linked to mental illness of all kinds – with a recent paper in the <em>British Journal of Psychiatry</em> showing that even small increases in local pollution raise the need for treatment by a third and for hospitalisation by a fifth – and to worse memory, attention and vocabulary, as well as ADHD and autism spectrum disorders. Pollution has been shown to damage the development of neurons in the brain, and proximity to a coal plant can deform a baby’s DNA in the womb. It even accelerates the degeneration of the eyesight.</p><p>A high pollution level in the year a baby is born has been shown to result in reduced earnings and labour force participation at the age of thirty. The relationship of pollution to premature births and low birth weight is so strong that the introduction of the automatic toll system E-ZPass in American cities reduced both problems in areas close to toll plazas (by 10.8 per cent and 11.8 per cent respectively), by cutting down on the exhaust expelled when cars have to queue. Extremely premature births, another study found, were 80 per cent more likely when mothers lived in areas of heavy traffic. Women breathing exhaust fumes during pregnancy gave birth to children with higher rates of paediatric leukaemia, kidney cancer, eye tumours and malignancies in the ovaries and testes. Infant death rates increased in line with pollution levels, as did heart malformations. And those breathing dirtier air in childhood exhibited significantly higher rates of self-harm in adulthood, with an increase of just five micrograms of small particulates a day associated, in 1.4 million people in Denmark, with a 42 per cent rise in violence towards oneself. Depression in teenagers quadruples; suicide becomes more common too.</p><p>Stock market returns are lower on days with higher air pollution, a study found this year. Surgical outcomes are worse. Crime goes up with increased particulate concentrations, especially violent crime: a 10 per cent reduction in pollution, researchers at Colorado State University found, could reduce the cost of crime in the US by $1.4 billion a year. When there’s more smog in the air, chess players make more mistakes, and bigger ones. Politicians speak more simplistically, and baseball umpires make more bad calls.</p><p>In 2019, a comprehensive global review by the Forum of International Respiratory Societies found that air pollution damages every organ, indeed virtually every cell, in the body. Nanoparticles of pollution have been found inside the brainstems of even the very young. But you don’t have to wait until birth to see the effects of breathing particulate matter. The impact begins in the womb, damaging the development of lungs and shortening future lives. In 2019, a small-scale study at Hasselt University found particles of black carbon in every single placenta examined, including those from mothers who lived in areas where the air was thought to be clean, with thousands of particles found in every cubic millimetre. For those who worry about microplastics in the flesh of fish, this is a yet more invasive category of intrusion. Of course, there are also microplastics in the air. They’ve been found in placentas too.</p><p><span>T</span><span>hat</span>​ everything is worse in the presence of pollution means that everything should be better in its absence. And, as best we can tell, it is. According to the National Resources Defence Council, the US Clean Air Act of 1970 is still saving 370,000 American lives every year – more than would have been saved last year had the pandemic never arrived. According to the NRDC, a single piece of legislation delivers annual economic benefits of more than $3 trillion, 32 times the cost of enacting it – benefits distributed disproportionately to the poor and marginalised. The American experience provides the basis for self-justifying indifference to pollution: according to what’s often called the ‘environmental Kuznets curve’, development makes countries dirtier before they get cleaner. This is wishful thinking, implying that pollution is an inevitable consequence of development, which can’t conceivably be achieved cleanly; and that it is in a way consensual, as if taking a job expresses a willingness to choke all the way to work. It also suggests that the effect is temporary, since societies at a certain level of wealth will refuse to put up with heavy pollution. But if more than 90 per cent of the planet’s population have lived for years in places with dangerously polluted air, 90 per cent also live where renewable energy is cheaper than dirty. This one fact renders the ‘economic bargain’ of air pollution, if it could ever be said to be credible, no better than an alibi.</p><p>In London, the gains over a single lifetime have been striking. ‘On Friday, 5 December 1952 my dad left work in South London, stepped out into the darkness and realised this was not going to be an ordinary journey home,’ Gary Fuller writes in <em>The Invisible Killer: The Rising Global Threat of Air Pollution – and How We Can Fight Back</em> (2018). ‘The fog was exceptionally thick. It was as if the world around him had vanished.’ He had to feel his way along the kerb all the way home.’ Throughout the city, visibility was reduced to just a yard, Tim Smedley writes in <em>Clearing the Air: The Beginning and the End of Air Pollution</em>.<span><a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v43/n23/footnotes/ten-million-a-year-footnote-3">†</a></span> ‘People couldn’t even see their own feet. Blinded commuters stepped off bridges into the icy Thames and from railway platforms into the path of oncoming trains.’ The smoke stuck to windscreens ‘like paint, forcing drivers to abandon their vehicles’. In 1952, the fog was estimated to have killed four thousand people in London, though later estimates tripled the figure; the rate of death was higher than in the cholera epidemic of 1866. The hospitals were overwhelmed. Four years later the Clean Air Act was introduced, and in relatively short order the pea-soupers that had given the city a permanent-seeming identity – reflected in the works of Dickens, Monet and Conan Doyle – came to an end.</p><p>In China, particulate pollution has been cut by a third since 2013, when the state declared ‘war’ on it. In the 1990s, when Mexico City was more polluted than Delhi, 80 per cent of 10 and 11-year-olds asked the colour of the sky responded ‘grey’, Smedley writes; only 10 per cent said ‘blue’. Today the city only just ranks in the list of the world’s thousand most polluted cities, with air as clean as the Northern French town of Roubaix, terminus of the famous cycle race.</p><p>That those gains are so large doesn’t mean there aren’t much bigger ones to reap. In China, more than a million people still die each year from air pollution. In Africa, another million. In London, Gardiner estimates, 9500, about 20 per cent of the city’s total deaths, despite the apparent success of the Ultra Low Emission Zone. The Twitter account @CleanAirLondon has begun to tally deaths attributable to pollution by area in real time. About two-thirds of the population of the UK, Smedley calculates, are living with pollution above the legal limit set by the EU, and millions of British children are going to school in dangerously dirty air.</p><p>The World Bank estimates that as much as 6 per cent of global GDP is lost to pollution and puts the annual loss at $8.1 trillion. Last year, Drew Shindell of Duke University, an expert on pollution impact, appeared before the US House Committee on Oversight and Reform. By further cleaning up America’s air over the next fifty years, Shindell’s research shows, the country could prevent 4.5 million premature deaths, 1.4 million hospitalisations, 1.7 million cases of dementia and 300 million lost work days. The result, he calculated, would be $700 billion a year in net benefits, ‘far more than the cost of the energy transition’. In other words, a total decarbonisation of the US economy would pay for itself through public health gains alone. The American Environmental Protection Agency has an official measure for the value of a single human life: $7 million in 2006 dollars. If you take that number seriously, the annual value of saving the 350,000 lives a year lost to pollution would be $2.45 trillion.</p><p>Globally, air pollution cuts life expectancy by almost two years. The average inhabitant of Delhi would live 9.7 years longer were it not for air pollution. The figure is 8.5 years across the Indo-Gangetic plains, where 500 million people live. Cutting air pollution to the WHO standard would add 5.9 years of life expectancy to 1.38 billion Indians, 5.4 years to 164.7 million Bangladeshis and 3.9 years to 220 million Pakistanis. Annually, 349,000 stillbirths and miscarriages in South Asia can be attributed to air pollution, and 116,000 infants die from its effects in their first month.</p><p>These numbers demand that we reorder our picture of the world we live in, recalculating the brutality of the present. It becomes plain that clean air and clean water and human health should be restored to the centre of the environmental crusade – rather than at the margins, where they’ve been relegated as the movement has coalesced around the necessary project of addressing climate change through decarbonisation. (As a side benefit, clean air and clean water tend to be much more popular with voters than climate-focused environmental policies.) The long timescale of global warming has often made it hard to mobilise a majority against damage that may occur decades, or even generations, in the future. That timescale no longer looks quite so distended, after the last few years of serial disaster – fire, storm and flood – but air pollution provides an even more urgent motive for change: millions are dying, right now, because of it, and because particulate pollution dissipates much more quickly than carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, abating that pollution would save lives swiftly. Carbon hangs in the air for centuries if we don’t remove it; local pollution abates almost as soon as the match is extinguished.</p><p>There’s a further incentive for individual governments to prioritise the addressing of pollution. The benefits of decarbonisation – chiefly that it limits temperature rise – are distributed globally, which in practice means that local actors wait and see how quickly others are moving before moving themselves. Air pollution changes the calculus: for one thing, it’s actually under the control of local and national governments. It’s also a significant burden on public health, which if alleviated offers immediate benefits every government should want to seize.</p><p>A final implication of numbers as large as ten million deaths a year is that, certainly in terms of human mortality and probably in terms of human suffering, over the next few decades the toll of air pollution from the burning of fossil fuels will be greater than all the other impacts of climate change combined, at least as we currently quantify them. Global warming will of course deliver punishing and transformative impacts well below the threshold of mortality: flooding, drought, crop failure; poverty and forced migration and possibly state collapse; hurricanes and wildfire of unprecedented intensity. But as brutal as these may be, they don’t add up to anywhere near ten million deaths a year – or even one million – unless you add to most models the effects of improbable feedback loops (large-scale release of methane from melting permafrost in the northern latitudes, for instance) or widespread civilisational collapse.</p><p>Warming may well destabilise societies: it’s certainly not out of the question. But the damage done by air pollution isn’t hypothetical, and it’s happening at a much bigger scale. According to the WHO, extreme heat killed at least 166,000 people around the world between 1998 and 2017 – 8700 a year. Air pollution killed about a thousand times more. Other estimates are higher, but even the highest – the <em>Lancet</em>’s half a million heat-related deaths per year – is just a twentieth of the toll of air pollution. Earlier this year, Madagascar was said to be on the brink of the world’s first ‘climate famine’, with 30,000 on the verge of starvation. In the same country, Unicef estimates, more than 40,000 already die each year from the effects of air pollution. The Climate Impact Lab recently published a comprehensive accounting of the ‘global mortality consequences for climate change’. The lab, a consortium of environmental scientists and economists from a wide range of US institutions, is known for being at the alarm-raising vanguard of the serious research on the effects of warming. Their highest estimate for the end of this century – assuming an implausibly high emissions scenario called RCP8.5 – was for an annual death toll from climate change of 73 deaths per 100,000 people. Today, air pollution is killing up to 126 per 100,000. In a more plausible scenario, the report projects fewer than 20 deaths per 100,000.</p><p><span>P</span><span>erhaps,</span>​ like me, you have spent the last five years in a state of panic about climate change. Perhaps it has inflamed your politics, and your sense of self. It should. The world is already warmer than it has ever been in the history of human civilisation. We have already exceeded the narrow temperature window which gave rise to everything we know as agriculture and society and politics and culture. The last time there was as much carbon in the atmosphere as there is today, temperatures weren’t 1.2°C warmer than the pre-industrial base level, as they are now, but about 3°C, with forests growing in the Antarctic and sea levels twenty metres higher.</p><p>The climate is changing ten times faster than ever before in a planetary history that includes mass extinctions which wiped out more than 90 per cent of life on Earth. Half of that damage has been done in the last 25 years, since the publication of Al Gore’s first book on global warming and the formation of the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change – in other words, with the full knowledge of the scientific community and the effective consent of global political leaders. A quarter of the change has taken place since Barack Obama was elected president, having hubristically proclaimed that ‘this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal.’ Just a few years later, he bragged to an audience in Texas that ‘suddenly, America is the biggest oil producer. That was me, people.’</p><p>In 2018 an IPCC report declared that giving the planet a good chance of staying below 2°C of warming and avoiding the catastrophic effects that would bring – island nations have called it genocide; African climate ambassadors ‘certain death’ for the continent – would require a 45 per cent reduction in emissions this decade. The report suggested that such a rapid timeline would require a global World War Two-scale mobilisation beginning the following year, 2019. Instead, emissions went up, and will be up again, it appears, in 2021, after a brief dip during the pandemic.</p><p>An IPCC report released in August also noted that air pollution has limited the level of warming, to the extent that if it were removed global temperatures would be half a degree higher than they are now. The reason: aerosols reflect sunlight back into space and therefore hold temperature rise below the level our carbon concentrations alone would dictate. Some estimates of the cooling effect run even higher: the climate scientist James Hansen believes the rate of global warming could double as aerosols decline. Cutting air pollution probably won’t produce a sudden temperature spike, because the transition would be gradual, but we would probably already be close to the 2°C threshold if we weren’t also producing enough particulate matter to kill ten million people a year.</p><p>If we fail to keep the rise below 2°C, we may see what used to be once in a century floods happening every single year; major cities in South Asia and the Middle East experiencing ‘lethal’ heat for two hundred or more days a year; the total loss of the planet’s coral reefs, which provide food, income and coastal protection to a half a billion people; and possibly irreversible acceleration of sea-level rise as a result of the melting of the Arctic ice sheets. And the climate may be more sensitive to our carbon perturbations than median estimates predict: a doubling of carbon concentrations from the pre-industrial average produces anything from two degrees of warming to six, depending on the model. At three degrees, a quarter of potential global GDP could be wiped out; in many equatorial regions there would be no hope of economic growth at all. At four degrees, crop yields could drop dramatically, and parts of the world might be hit by up to six climate-driven natural disasters at once.</p><p>All these impacts, even if unleashed, probably won’t surpass present-day air pollution in terms of human mortality for a very long time. Reducing fossil fuel pollution won’t solve the problem. Last year, wildfires accounted for more than half of the air pollution in the western United States – meaning that more particulate matter from burning forests infiltrated the lungs of Americans living in those states than from all other human and industrial activity combined. By the middle of the century, the extent of those fires is expected to double, at the very least, with each tree burned releasing carbon just as coal does, along with particulate matter. The worst air quality in the world is now routinely registered in California, and although these record-setting events typically last only a few days, it is already the case that the smoke from last year’s fires can be held responsible for five thousand additional pre-term births in the state. Globally, the world’s wildfire smoke delivers only a fraction of air pollution, but the fraction is growing. The 2021 fires are still smouldering, and wildfire emissions from this year have reached 4.7 billion tons of carbon, not far off the 5.1 billion produced last year by the US, which is the world’s second biggest emitter.</p><p>Fire is eternal in the American west, of course, but when climate sceptics point to evidence of ancient megafires, they neglect to mention that at the time there weren’t forty million people living in California. In the entire 20th century, there were only five fires that burned more than 100,000 acres. In 2020, there were eleven such fires – one blaze, the August Complex fire in Mendocino, which burned more than a million acres, seemed to demand a new term, ‘gigafire’, to describe it. Each of these fires has produced an unprecedented amount of smoke, so much of it that the fires create their own weather systems – pyrocumulus clouds, fire tornadoes and lightning storms, the lightning sometimes travelling miles from the central point of ignition, and sparking more fire where it lands, producing yet more smoke.</p><p>In some ways fear of smoke is more logical than fear of fire. In many parts of California, you can be confident your house won’t burn down. The chances are that you can evade the flames of even rampant wildfire. But smoke can’t be quarantined. This summer in the resort community of Lake Tahoe – where the Air Quality Index, which describes 51 on its scale as ‘hazardous’, hit 700 – those trapped inside during oppressive weeks of smoke finally fled their vacation homes. Poisoned air reached as far as the East Coast of the US, where more deaths are caused every year by western wildfires than in the west itself, and across the Atlantic to Europe, where around the Mediterranean unprecedented fires were already burning, forcing evacuations from resort hotels.</p><p>The story is global, the world wrapped in smoke. In British Columbia, more carbon is now unleashed each year from forest fires than from all other sources. In Australia, where bushfires are an enduring feature of both landscape and legend, 46 million acres burned in the 2019-20 season – ten times the record-setting California season that would follow, and enough to kill, it was estimated, more than a billion animals. The smoke in Sydney Harbour was so thick ferries couldn’t navigate it, and the particulates so dense that fire alarms were triggered in office buildings, the sensors concluding that there had to be flames nearby. In Siberia, where ‘zombie fires’ now burn regularly through the Arctic winter, carbon released from forests in flames regularly sends heavy smoke across the North Pole to the other side of the planet.</p><p>And then there’s South America, where 30 per cent of the Pantanal, the world’s largest tropical wetland, was lost to fire in a single year – 2020. In the Amazon, so much land is burned to clear trees for farming that the fires release three times as much carbon as all other forms of emission in Brazil – enough to make the rainforest itself, if it were a country, the world’s fifth largest emitter, and to turn the celebrated ‘carbon sink’, which might aid in our fight against warming, into a net source of global carbon. In theory, the burning could be halted, and it may at least be slowed if Lula succeeds Bolsonaro and returns to Brazil’s presidency next year. But the longer-term decline of the rainforest may lie outside the reach of national policy, as current global emissions trajectories suggest an irreversible tipping point for the region by the 2040s: less forest and more grass, less new growth and more new dying, more heat and therefore more fire. The Amazon has long been called ‘the lungs of the planet’. It may soon become a bellows. Everything we burn, we breathe.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>While life may soon start to feel a little less sweet for EV owners in Norway, the country is eyeing its next strategic move toward an even greener future, and that means fewer private cars (even electric varieties) clogging the roads in favor of walking, cycling, and taking the bus. </p>



<div><p>Norway is leading the world in electric car adoption, with more than 65% of new passenger cars sold in the country in 2021 being electric – and generous tax incentives and perks like free parking have played no small role in that. But the government just announced a new plan to roll back VAT exemptions, especially for higher-end vehicles, with an eye toward potentially slashing more benefits. </p><p>First up is the VAT exemption for EVs priced at more than 500,000 kroner (about $51,700)&nbsp;as of January 1, 2023. The new VAT scheme will be dynamic in that the more expensive the electric car, the higher the VAT fee it incurs from next year. </p></div>



<p>Norwegian news outlet <em>The Local </em><a href="https://www.thelocal.no/20220512/norway-to-remove-vat-exemption-for-electric-cars/">postulates</a> that an EV priced at more than 600,000 kroner ($62,000) would be charged a VAT of 25,000 kroner ($2,580) or around 4%. An electric car priced near the 1 million kroner mark ($103,000) could incur up to a 12.5% VAT – which to this France-based reporter seems perfectly reasonable. Note that the standard &nbsp;VAT in Norway is 25%, which is already on the high end compared to the European average of 21%.</p>



<p>Norway already has a goal in place of reducing fossil fuel-burning vehicle sales to zero by 2025 – 10 years earlier than the plan set by the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/eu-lawmakers-back-effective-ban-new-fossil-fuel-cars-2035-2022-05-11/">European Parliament last week</a>. But Norway says it isn’t hoping to simply replace combustion engines with electric counterparts 1:1 but motivate people to get out of their private vehicles and walk, cycle, and take public transport, the latter which was particularly hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<div><p>EV owners in Norway have long enjoyed a range of <a href="https://elbil.no/english/norwegian-ev-policy/">enticing perks</a> over fossil fuel car owners, from reduced road tolls to driving in bus lanes to free parking, in addition to no purchase or import taxes – and while some of this has already been scaled back due to the huge growth in electric car ownership, the government in taking another hard look in hopes of bumping up public transportation usage and reducing traffic, especially in and around cities. Still, no official plan has been released just yet.</p><p>Norwegian Transport Minister Jon-Ivar Nygard said in the statement:</p></div>



<blockquote><p>Electric cars give us greener transport, but they also have a clear intermodal competition with public transport in urban areas. We must make it more attractive to travel by public transport, cycle, and walk.</p></blockquote>



<p>Of course, the Norwegian Electric Car Association, which represents 110,000&nbsp;EV owners in the country, isn’t happy with the new VAT measures. Christine Bu, the association’s general secretary, told Norwegian media outlet <a href="https://www.nrk.no/norge/revidert-nasjonalbudsjett_-fjernar-momsfritak-for-elbilar-_-innforer-tilskotsordning-1.15964393">NRK</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p> The entire electric car policy is at stake. It’s an incomprehensibly bad idea.</p></blockquote>



<h2 id="h-electrek-s-take">Electrek’s Take</h2>



<p>Norway is well on pace to meet its <a href="https://electrek.co/2022/04/06/norway-keeps-breaking-ev-adoption-records-tesla-model-y-leads/">all-electric goals by 2025,</a> and while that’s exciting, the country looks ready to take the next step in making cities, in particular, more livable, safer, while reducing electricity demands and traffic accidents overall. Fewer cars on the road is the only way forward. While more Norwegians than ever before are driving electric vehicles, they are also driving more miles than ever before. In fact, half of European car journeys are less than three miles – the kind of distance that for a majority of people is doable by bike, bus, or a brisk walk. Plus with Norway offering so many bonus perks, like EVs cruising down bus lanes (which really should be reserved for actual buses) to free parking (which then creates more demand for parking spaces in lieu of urban parks or green spaces), driving becomes an “easy” choice. But cities congested with cars and unrestrained car usage isn’t the utopian future we’re all dreaming of – and Norway is posed once again to lead the charge with a vision of what’s next after a full electric transition takes place. I think we can all agree that the world would be a lot nicer with fewer cars and more bikes, safe walking and cycling paths, and efficient buses.</p>

                <p>In urban stormwater, particles from tyre wear were the most prevalent microplastic a new Griffith-led study has found.</p>
<p>Published in <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.3c03949"><em>Environmental Science &amp; Technology</em></a>, the study showed that in stormwater runoff during rain approximately 19 out of every 20 microplastics collected were tyre wear particles with anywhere from 2 to 59 particles per litre of water.</p>

<p>“Pollution of our waterways by microplastics is an emerging environmental concern due to their persistence and accumulation in aquatic organisms and ecosystems,” said lead author <a href="https://experts.griffith.edu.au/9419-shima-ziajahromi">Dr Shima Ziajahromi</a>, a research fellow at the <a href="https://www.griffith.edu.au/australian-rivers-institute">Australian Rivers Institute</a>.</p>
<p>“Stormwater runoff which contains a mixture of sediment, chemical, organic and physical pollutants, is a critical pathway for microplastics to washed off from urban environments during rain and into local aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>“But to date, our knowledge of the amount of microplastics in urban stormwater, particularly tyre wear particles, is limited, as is the potential strategies we can use to minimise this source.”</p>
<p>Tyre rubber contains up to 2500 chemicals with the contaminants that leach from tyres considered more toxic to bacteria and microalgae than other plastic polymers.</p>
<p>“Due to the analytical challenges in measuring this source of microplastics in stormwater, research to date often lacks information about the actual number of tyre wear particles water samples,” said Dr Ziajahromi.</p>
<p>Quantitative information of this type is crucial to improve our understanding of the amount of tyre wear particles in stormwater, assess the risk to the environment, and to develop management strategies.</p>

<p>“Our study quantified and characterize microplastics and tyre wear particles in both stormwater runoff and sediment of stormwater drainage systems in Queensland,” said co-author <a href="https://experts.griffith.edu.au/18672-frederic-leusch">Professor Fred Leusch</a>, who leads the Australian Rivers Institute’s Toxicology Research Program.</p>
<p>“We also assessed the effectiveness of a stormwater treatment device to capture and remove these contaminants from stormwater and evaluated the role of a constructed stormwater wetland for capturing microplastics in the sediment, removing it from stormwater runoff.</p>
<p>“The device is a bag made of 0.2 millimetre mesh which can be retrofitted to stormwater drains. Although originally designed to capture gross pollutants, sediment, litter and oil and grease, it significantly reduced microplastics from raw runoff, with up to 88% less microplastics in treated water which had passed through the device.”</p>

<p>Sediment samples collected from the inlet and outlet of a constructed stormwater wetland contained between 1450 to 4740 particles in every kilogram of sediment, with more microplastics in the sediment at the inlet than the outlet, indicating the wetland’s ability to remove them from stormwater.</p>
<p>“Microplastics that enter constructed wetlands for stormwater drainage systems settle in the sediment and form a biofilm, leading to their accumulation over time, removing them from stormwater runoff,” said Dr Ziajahromi.</p>
<p>“Urban stormwater runoff typically requires treatment for the removal of suspended solids and nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus in many jurisdictions in Australia, with some also requiring the removal of gross pollutants. However, regulations are lagging behind when it comes to microplastics and tyre wear particles.”</p>
<p>“Our findings show that both constructed wetlands and the stormwater capture device are strategies that could be potentially used to prevent or at least decrease the amount of microplastics tyre wear particles being transported from stormwater into our waterways.”</p>

<p>The biggest Internet service providers will dominate a $42.45 billion broadband grant program unless the Biden administration changes a rule requiring grant recipients to obtain a letter of credit from a bank, according to a joint statement from consumer advocacy groups, local government officials, and advocates for small ISPs.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://connect-humanity.shorthandstories.com/bead-letter-of-credit-alternatives/">letter</a> sent today to US government officials argues that "by establishing capital barriers too steep for all but the best-funded ISPs, the LOC [letter-of-credit requirement] shuts out the vast majority of entities the program claims to prioritize: small and community-centered ISPs, minority and women-owned ISPs, nonprofits, and municipalities."</p>
<p>The rule is part of the Broadband Equity Access and Deployment (BEAD) <a href="https://broadbandusa.ntia.doc.gov/funding-programs/broadband-equity-access-and-deployment-bead-program">program</a> that's being administered by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA).</p>
<p>"Rather than demonstrating a provider's ability to construct a broadband network and provide high-speed broadband services to unserved and underserved Americans, the LOC is a measure of whether they can lock up valuable working capital over multiple years," the letter said. "While large incumbents may be able to bear this financial burden, most others can not. And, due to various state and local rules, municipalities are often not allowed to obtain LOCs. Therefore, alternatives to the LOC are critical to ensure these providers can participate in the BEAD program."</p>
<p>The director of the BEAD program, Evan Feinman, responded to letter-of-credit concerns during a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_ZWWETMaM0&amp;t=21s">webinar</a> in June. He said the NTIA is aiming to "minimize the failure rate, because every project that's undertaken will expend some funds prior to failing and then have to start back at square one with a new provider if it turns out that a provider doesn't have the wherewithal to undertake a project."</p>
<p>"We know that when we narrow [who can get funding], we're going to lose the opportunity to get into partnership with some high-quality small outfits. But we had to err on one side or the other, there was no way to hit it right on the nose," Feinman said. The NTIA will waive the LOC requirement on a case-by-case basis, but waivers will be "tightly controlled," he said.</p>                                            
                                                        
<h2>Biden’s former FCC nominee among 300 letter-signers</h2>
<p>Today's letter objecting to the letter-of-credit rule was signed by "a coalition of 300 broadband experts, ISPs, community leaders, nonprofits, consumer advocates, and business groups," said the <a href="https://www.benton.org/headlines/benton-institute-joins-broadband-experts-isps-and-local-leaders-urge-biden-administration">Benton Institute for Broadband &amp; Society</a>. Local government officials from various parts of the US were among the signers.</p>
<p>One signer is Gigi Sohn, the longtime consumer advocate who was nominated by President Biden to the Federal Communications Commission. After the US Senate <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/03/bidens-fcc-pick-withdraws-regrets-that-isps-get-to-choose-their-regulators/">refused to confirm</a> her nomination, Sohn became executive director of the nonprofit <a href="https://aapb.us/">American Association for Public Broadband</a> that lobbies for municipal networks.</p>
<p>The letter was signed by advocates from various other broadband-focused groups, including Public Knowledge; Connect Humanity; the Schools, Health &amp; Libraries Broadband Coalition; the Institute for Local Self-Reliance; Free Press; Next Century Cities; the Multicultural Media, Telecom, and Internet Council; the Coalition for Local Internet Choice; and Consumer Reports.</p>
<p>The letter was sent to Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo and NTIA Administrator Alan Davidson. Describing the BEAD program requirements, the letter said that participants must obtain a letter of credit "issued by an FDIC bank with Weiss rating of B- or better for 25 percent of the award amount."</p>
<h2>Rules strike wrong balance, letter says</h2>
<p>Funding rules are intended to ensure that ISPs deliver on commitments to build networks. As we <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/08/internet-providers-that-won-fcc-grants-try-to-escape-broadband-commitments/">wrote last month</a>, some ISPs that won grants from a different federal program are trying to escape their broadband-deployment commitments.</p>
<p>But the letter to the NTIA and Commerce Department argued that the letter-of-credit requirement is a bad method of ensuring compliance:</p>
<blockquote><p>Banks providing LOCs require that they be collateralized by cash or cash-equivalent. As a result, awardees will have to lock away vast sums of capital for the full duration of the build, likely several years. With the additional 25 percent match requirement, recipients will have a capital hurdle of more than 60 percent of their grant. We <a href="https://connecthumanity.fund/why-the-letter-of-credit-requirement-could-sink-bead/">estimate</a> a provider seeking a $7.5 million grant for a $10 million project will need at least $4.6 million of their own capital up-front.</p>
<p>While we support the NTIA's intention of ensuring providers are accountable for delivering on grants, far from safeguarding taxpayer dollars, the LOC requirement will prevent the Internet service providers best positioned to connect unserved and underserved Americans from participating.</p></blockquote>
<p>ISPs that signed the letter include Astound Broadband (owner of Grande, RCN, and Wave) and several smaller providers. A lobby group for small providers, the Wireless Internet Service Providers Association, signed as well.</p>

Extracting and querying hundreds of fields across a photo library spanning thousands of images can be tricky. Luckily, there are a number of tools available to help us with the task.</p><p><a href="https://exiftool.org/"><code>exiftool</code></a> is the gold-standard here, and I highly recommend playing around with it. The <a href="https://exiftool.org/TagNames/EXIF.html">documentation and tag reference</a> is a treasure trove when attempting to figure out what obscure fields mean.</p><p>For storing and querying the photos, we'll be using <code>sqlite</code>. It's suitable for our purposes and is plenty performant.</p><p>Start by installing them, using <code>brew</code> if you're on a Mac:</p><div><p><span>bash</span></p><pre><p><span>brew </span><span>install</span><span> sqlite3 exiftool</span></p></pre></div><p>Extracting a set of photos from Apple Photos can be surprisingly tricky. The underlying schema and storage of images — many of which contain originals stored remotely within iCloud — requires specialist tools to parse. <a href="https://github.com/RhetTbull/osxphotos"><code>osxphotos</code></a> is the tool for the job here. You can use it to export your full Apple Photo library in any format, and flags like <code>--added-in-last "1 month"</code> allow for detailed filtering. The following worked well for me as an example data set: </p><div><p><span>bash</span></p><pre><p><span>osxphotos </span><span>export</span><span> --added-in-last </span><span>"1 month"</span><span> --only-photos --not-edited --exif Model iPhone ./export</span></p></pre></div><p>Once we have a directory of images, we can use <code>exiftool</code> to extract metadata into a CSV —</p><div><p><span>bash</span></p><pre><p><span>exiftool -n -m -csv ./images </span><span>&gt;</span><span> exif.csv</span></p></pre></div><p>and then import this CSV into <code>sqlite</code> for querying —</p><div><p><span>sql</span></p><pre><p><span>sqlite exif</span><span>.</span><span>db</span></p><p><span>sqlite</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>.</span><span>mode</span><span> csv</span></p><p><span>sqlite</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>.</span><span>import</span><span> exif</span><span>.</span><span>csv photos</span></p><p><span>sqlite</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>SELECT</span><span> </span><span>count</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>FROM</span><span> photos</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>68182</span></p></pre></div><p>With this, we now have a database of queryable metadata for every image we've ever taken.</p><p>Let’s ask this data some questions!</p><h2>Fields of Interest</h2><p>Whilst browsing the wealth of metadata available, some fields stood out to me. Some of these are EXIF standards, but many are specific to Apple cameras:</p><p><strong>Field of View (<code>FOV</code>)</strong>
The horizontal field of view captured by the image.</p><p><strong>Orientation / Heading (<code>GPSImgDirection</code>)</strong>
Along with position (latitude and longitude), EXIF also stores information about where the camera is pointed when an image is captured. This, combined with a camera's field of view, allows us to can annotate our map positions with a cone of vision.</p><p><strong>Altitude (<code>GPSAltitudeRef</code>)</strong>
The altitude of an image, whilst often imprecise, can be used to give 3D data to a 2D latitude/longitude pair. This additional dimension is useful in multi-layer buildings and structures, or when airborne.</p><p><strong>Speed (<code>GPSSpeed</code>)</strong>
How fast the camera was moving when the image was captured.</p><p><strong>Elevation Angle (<code>CameraElevationAngle</code>)</strong>
Given enough precision, when combined with an <code>x,y,z</code> point in space from <code>GPSLatitude</code>, <code>GPSLongitude</code>, and <code>GPSAltitudeRef</code> and a 1D angle from <code>GPSImgDirection</code>, we can fire a 3D vector through space at a given point in time.</p><p><strong>Image Noise (<code>SignalToNoiseRatio</code>)</strong>
The amount of signal vs. noise that the camera sensor has captured. Can be used to signify image quality.</p><p><strong>Camera Uptime (<code>RunTimeValue</code>)</strong>
A curious piece of data: how long the camera has been running since it was last powered on. In a world of always-on smartphones it's curious why this is still relevant, but it gets recorded regardless.</p><p><strong>Point of Focus (<code>FocusDistance</code> &amp; <code>FocusPosition</code>)</strong>
The distance from the camera at which the image is focused.</p><p><strong>Camera Acceleration (<code>AccelerationVector</code>)</strong>
A 3-dimensional vector showing the camera's acceleration forwards/backwards, up/down, and side-to-side.</p><hr><p>These fields allow us to ask some interesting questions of our photo

Where are the tools to <em>see</em> this?</p><p>Large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI’s GPT-4 have helped bridge us into the world of "vague computing", allowing us to query knowledge without knowing precisely what we're looking for. However, there's still a monumental amount of use in direct interaction with real-time feedback for filtering large datasets in order to ask questions.</p><p>Computer interfaces are exploratory mechanisms. Our current photo management tools often expose EXIF metadata as a read-only interface, but what would an EXIF-powered photo exploration tool look like?</p><h3>Mapping</h3><p>Combining <code>GPSLatitude</code>, <code>GPSLongitude</code>, <code>GPSAltitude</code>, <code>GPSImgDirection</code>, and <code>FieldOfView</code> would allow us to not only place images as pins on a map, but to show these images floating in 3D space, with a cone of vision emanating from the origin point out towards the contents of the image:</p><p><img src="https://hturan.com/img/writing/exploring-exif/3d-map.png"></p><p>Imagine a series of these dotted over a 3D map, showing points of intersection of a subject through time and space. Or imagine a spatial computing app for the Vision Pro, allowing you to walk through a landscape of your own images:</p><p><img src="https://hturan.com/img/writing/exploring-exif/3d-world.jpg"></p><p><img src="https://hturan.com/img/writing/exploring-exif/ar-photos.jpg"><img src="https://hturan.com/img/writing/exploring-exif/ar-photos-2.jpg"></p><h3>Filtering</h3><p>How do you currently find photos in your photo library? For me, spatial memory comes first — oftentimes I use the map view of the Photos app to hone in on <em>where</em> a photo was taken before scrubbing through time to whittle down the options of <em>when</em> it was taken.</p><p>What if we had a filterable interface for each of these EXIF dimensions — space, time, speed, angle, person count — allowing us to combine fragments of our memory in order to hone in faster?</p><p>We have great tools for searching a single one of these dimensions, but we‘re severely lacking in combining all of them into an exploratory interface.</p><p>Exploratory interaction paradigms (such as hand-tracking or MIDI interfaces) can be used to narrow down a vast, multi-dimensional dataset:</p><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true"><a href="https://twitter.com/hturan/status/1693981099142381910"></a></blockquote><h2>Implications</h2><p>When you post a photo from a friend’s apartment building online, you're not just providing the image itself, you’re providing the latitude, longitude, and altitude too. With favorable GPS precision, it's entirely possible to find the exact apartment in which the photo was taken.</p><p><img src="https://hturan.com/img/writing/exploring-exif/enhance.png"></p><p>In fact, when you give an iOS app full access to your photo library, you're giving all of this information away too. Here are the Swift <code>kCGImageProperty</code> keys for <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/imageio/exif_dictionary_keys">EXIF</a>, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/imageio/gps_dictionary_keys">GPS</a>, and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/imageio/iptc_dictionary_keys">IPTC</a> image metadata, detailing the information available to any app that can access your photos using the iOS <code>UIImagePickerController</code> (as of iOS 17 at least). Any app that can access your photo library can, with enough effort, determine your address, where you shop, where your friends live, where you go on holiday, where you work, and when you go to bed. This is without looking at anything within the images themselves.</p><hr><p>You’ll be pleased/saddened by the lack of AI in this piece.</p><p>If AI is powered by big data, then your photo library’s metadata is really the biggest data you own, and you’ve been collecting it with every photo you take.</p><p>Recent advancements in image content recognition and segmentation (such as in Meta's incredible work on their <a href="https://segment-anything.com/">Segment Anything</a> model) allow further information to be gained directly from the contents of the image data. Apple Photos uses advanced on-device machine learning models to add "scores" to images — <code>ZOVERALLAESTHETICSCORE</code>, <code>ZINTERESTINGSUBJECTSCORE</code>, <code>ZHARMONIOUSCOLORSCORE</code>, <code>ZWELLCHOSENSUBJECTSCORE</code> — the results of which are then used to highlight images that users may find interesting.</p><p>Next time you view a photo, take a second to think about the metadata you're not viewing — the camera's acceleration, the camera's temperature, the scene visible just outside of the camera's recorded field of view.</p><p>Next time you take a photo and record that entry in the spatiotemporal narrative of your life, think about who you're sharing that narrative with.</p><p>But most of all, think about how you’ll feel when you use immersive, high-dimensional tools to share this narrative with people you love.</p><p><span>❋</span></p><hr><h2>References</h2><p><a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/May/21/dogsheep-photos/"><strong>Using SQL to find my best photo of a pelican according to Apple Photos</strong></a>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://wis-wander.weizmann.ac.il/life-sciences/human-embryo-models-grown-stem-cells">https://wis-wander.weizmann.ac.il/life-sciences/human-embryo-models-grown-stem-cells</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37409283">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A research team headed by Prof. <a href="https://www.weizmann.ac.il/molgen/hanna/" target="_blank">Jacob Hanna</a> at the Weizmann Institute of Science has created complete models of human embryos from stem cells cultured in the lab – and managed to grow them outside the womb up to day 14. <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06604-5" target="_blank">As reported today in <em>Nature</em></a>, these synthetic embryo models had all the structures and compartments characteristic of this stage, including the placenta, yolk sac, chorionic sac and other external tissues that ensure the models’ dynamic and adequate growth.</p><p><img alt="" src="https://wis-wander.weizmann.ac.il/sites/default/files/JH_2.jpg" title="A stem cell–derived human embryo model at a developmental stage equivalent to that of a day 14 embryo. The model has all the compartments that define this stage: the yolk sac (yellow) and the part that will become the embryo itself, topped by the amnion (blue) – all enveloped by cells that will become the placenta (pink)"></p><p>Cellular aggregates derived from human stem cells in previous studies could not be considered genuinely accurate human embryo models, because they lacked nearly all the defining hallmarks of a post-implantation embryo. In particular, they failed to contain several cell types that are essential to the embryo’s development, such as those that form the placenta and the chorionic sac. In addition, they did not have the structural organization characteristic of the embryo and revealed no dynamic ability to progress to the next developmental stage.</p><p>Given their authentic complexity, the human embryo models obtained by Hanna’s group may provide an unprecedented opportunity to shed new light on the embryo’s mysterious beginnings. Little is known about the early embryo because it is so difficult to study, for both ethical and technical reasons, yet its initial stages are crucial to its future development. During these stages, the clump of cells that implants itself in the womb on the seventh day of its existence becomes, within three to four weeks, a well-structured embryo that already contains all the body organs.</p><blockquote><h3>""The drama is in the first month, the remaining eight months of pregnancy are mainly lots of growth"</h3></blockquote><p>“The drama is in the first month, the remaining eight months of pregnancy are mainly lots of growth,” Hanna says. “But that first month is still largely a black box. Our stem cell–derived human embryo model offers an ethical and accessible way of peering into this box. It closely mimics the development of a real human embryo, particularly the emergence of its exquisitely fine architecture.”</p><p><img alt="" src="https://wis-wander.weizmann.ac.il/sites/default/files/JH_group_0.jpg" title="(l-r) Dr. Noa Novershtern, Dr. Vladyslav Bondarenko, Prof. Jacob Hanna, Dr. Bernardo Oldak and Emilie Wildschutz. Providing structure"></p><h2><strong>Letting the embryo model say “Go!” </strong></h2><p>Hanna’s team built on their previous experience in creating synthetic stem cell–based models of mouse embryos. <a href="https://wis-wander.weizmann.ac.il/life-sciences/without-egg-sperm-or-womb-synthetic-mouse-embryo-models-created-solely-stem-cells" target="_blank">As in that research</a>, the scientists made no use of fertilized eggs or a womb. Rather, they started out with human cells known as pluripotent stem cells, which have the potential to differentiate into many, though not all, cell types. Some were derived from adult skin cells that had been reverted to “stemness.” Others were the progeny of human stem cell lines that had been cultured for years in the lab.</p><p>The researchers then used Hanna’s recently developed method to reprogram pluripotent stem cells so as to turn the clock further back: to revert these cells to an even earlier state – known as the naïve state – in which they are capable of becoming anything, that is, specializing into any type of cell. This stage corresponds to day 7 of the natural human embryo, around the time it implants itself in the womb. Hanna’s team had in fact been the first to start describing methods to generate human naïve stem cells, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12745" target="_blank">back in 2013</a>; they <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-stem-cell/fulltext/S1934-5909(21)00158-2?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1934590921001582%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" target="_blank">continued to improve</a> these methods, which stand at the heart of the current project, over the years.</p><p><iframe frameborder="0" height="360" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m1OwekXUwig" title="Video of a stem cell–derived human embryo model at a developmental stage equivalent to that of a human embryo at day 14. It shows the hormone used in pregnancy tests (green) and the outer layer that will become the placenta (pink), including characteristic cavities, called lacunae. During normal pregnancy, the lacunae allow the exchange of nutrients and waste products between the maternal blood and the fetus" width="640"></iframe></p><p>The scientists divided the cells into three groups. The cells intended to develop into the embryo were left as is. The cells in each of the other groups were treated only with chemicals, without any need for genetic modification, so as to turn on certain genes, which was intended to cause these cells to differentiate toward one of three tissue types needed to sustain the embryo: placenta, yolk sac or the extraembryonic mesoderm membrane that ultimately creates the chorionic sac.</p><p>Soon after being mixed together under optimized, specifically developed conditions, the cells formed clumps, about 1 percent of which self-organized into complete embryo-like structures. “An embryo is self-driven by definition; we don’t need to tell it what to do – we must only unleash its internally encoded potential,” Hanna says. “It’s critical to mix in the right kinds of cells at the beginning, which can only be derived from naïve stem cells that have no developmental restrictions. Once you do that, the embryo-like model itself says, ‘Go!’”</p><p>The stem cell–based embryo-like structures (termed SEMs) developed normally outside the womb for 8 days, reaching a developmental stage equivalent to day 14 in human embryonic development. That’s the point at which natural embryos acquire the internal structures that enable them to proceed to the next stage: developing the progenitors of body organs.</p><h2><strong>Complete human embryo models match classic diagrams in terms of structure and cell identity</strong></h2><p>When the researchers compared the inner organization of their stem cell–derived embryo models with illustrations and microscopic anatomy sections in classical embryology atlases from the 1960s, they found an uncanny structural resemblance between the models and the natural human embryos at the corresponding stage. Every compartment and supporting structure was not only there, but in the right place, size and shape. Even the cells that make the hormone used in pregnancy testing were there and active: When the scientists applied secretions from these cells to a commercial pregnancy test, it came out positive.</p><p>This implied that their models faithfully emulated the process by which an early embryo gains all the structures it needs for beginning its transformation into a fetus. “Many failures of pregnancy occur in the first few weeks, often before the woman even knows she’s pregnant,” Hanna says. “That’s also when many birth defects originate, even though they tend to be discovered much later. Our models can be used to reveal the biochemical and mechanical signals that ensure proper development at this early stage, and the ways in which that development can go wrong.”</p><p><iframe frameborder="0" height="360" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LRyE9_veSag" title="A video presenting the characteristic structure of the yolk sac (yellow) in a stem cell–derived human embryo model at a developmental stage equivalent to that of a human embryo at day 12.

The researchers discovered that if the embryo is not enveloped by placenta-forming cells in the right manner at day 3 of the protocol (corresponding to day 10 in natural embryonic development), its internal structures, such as the yolk sac, fail to properly develop.</p><p>“An embryo is not static. It must have the right cells in the right organization, and it must be able to progress – it’s about being and becoming,” Hanna says. “Our complete embryo models will help researchers address the most basic questions about what determines its proper growth.”</p><p>This ethical approach to unlocking the mysteries of the very first stages of embryonic development could open numerous research paths. It might help reveal the causes of many birth defects and types of infertility. It could also lead to new technologies for growing transplant tissues and organs. And it could offer a way around experiments that cannot be performed on live embryos – for example, determining the effects of exposure to drugs or other substances on fetal development.</p></div><div><p>Taking part in this study were Dr. Bernardo Oldak, Emilie Wildschutz, Dr. Vladyslav Bondarenko, Alejandro Aguilera-Castrejon, Shadi Tarazi, Mehmet-Yunus Comar, Shahd Ashouokhi, Dmitry Lokshtanov, Dr. Francesco Roncato, Sergey Viukov, Eitan Ariel, Max Rose, Nir Livnat, Dr. Tom Shani, Carine Joubran, Roni Cohen and Dr. Noa Novershtern from Hanna’s lab in Weizmann’s Molecular Genetics Department; Dr. Yoseph Addadi and Dr. Merav Kedmi of Weizmann’s Life Sciences Core Facilities Department; Dr. Hadas Keren-Shaul of the Nancy and Stephen Grand Israel National Center for Personalized Medicine; Dr. Cheng Zhao, Prof. Sophie Petropoulos and Prof. Fredrik Lanner of the Karolinska Institutet; and Prof. Vincent Pasque of the University of Leuven, Belgium.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/09/05/amazon-andy-jassy-return-to-office-decisions-echo-chamber-ceo-feelings-work-gleb-tsipursky/">https://fortune.com/2023/09/05/amazon-andy-jassy-return-to-office-decisions-echo-chamber-ceo-feelings-work-gleb-tsipursky/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37408985">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Where are CEOs like Amazon’s Andy Jassy getting the data to inform their return-to-office policies? Unfortunately, too many are getting their data from the same place: an echo chamber of like-minded CEOs who use their feelings and intuitions to make these pivotal decisions. By relying on word of mouth and following their gut, rather than the data, these CEOs could be leading their companies into catastrophe.</p><div>



<p>During a recent internal fireside chat that was first reported by Insider and then confirmed by <a href="https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/" target="_blank" rel="">Amazon</a>, Jassy defended his top-down return-to-office mandate–a drastic shift from a <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/08/29/amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-return-to-office-mandate-or-face-consequences/" target="_self" rel="">flexible</a> policy of teams deciding what to do on their own to an obligation to come to the office three days a week. The company said employees knew all along that office policies would evolve with the pandemic–but it didn’t avert a backlash.</p>



<p>When asked for data to support the move, Jassy lacked a good answer. He said that he spoke to “60 to 80 CEOs of other companies over the last 18 months,” and “virtually all of them” preferred in-office work. He admitted it was a “judgment call” that wasn’t widely supported by data and compared it to another major decision that wasn’t supported by data in the past: the launch of the Amazon Web Services cloud unit.</p>



<h2>Data over feelings</h2>



<p>Is that an apt comparison? There were doubts internally and externally about the launch of AWS because it was an unproven business model. In other words, Amazon was going against the grain and taking a large risk with a huge potential upside if it worked. By contrast, a top-down RTO mandate of three days a week is not at all an “unproven business model.” There’s plenty of evidence around that model, much stronger than the echo chamber of like-minded CEOs. However, Jassy refused to lay out the evidence and relied instead on how he felt–and the validating echo chamber of other CEOs.</p>



<p>Doubling down on the rigid policy, Jassy <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/08/29/amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-return-to-office-mandate-or-face-consequences/" target="_self" rel="">told</a> staff that “it’s probably not going to work out for you” if you don’t come to the office. Amazon is tracking badge swipe data, and in early August sent a <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/amazon-uses-badge-swipe-data-to-tell-employees-they-arent-complying-with-return-to-office-policy/" target="_self" rel="">message</a> to some employees, saying “We are reaching out as you are not currently meeting our expectation of joining your colleagues in the office at least three days a week, even though your assigned building is ready.” Amazon says it shares aggregated and anonymized badge-swipe data with managers to provide an overall view of how many members of a team are coming into the office, but doesn’t give managers data about badge swipes by individual employees.</p>



<p>Of course, Jassy is far from the only CEO to launch a rigid, top-down RTO mandate without relying on data and instead focusing on feelings. Consider <a href="https://fortune.com/company/starbucks/" target="_blank" rel="">Starbucks</a> CEO Howard Schultz’s <a href="https://www.hcamag.com/us/specialization/employee-engagement/starbucks-to-set-stricter-rto-policy/432831" target="_self" rel="">directive</a> for corporate staff to <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/06/16/how-ceo-return-to-office-mandates-can-be-legitimate-but-backfire-rto/" target="_self" rel="">come</a> to the office three days a week this January. According to Schultz, this policy stemmed from his annoyance that corporate employees hadn’t been following a guideline encouraging them to come into the office one or two days a week, as tracked by badge swipes into the building. What a terrible way to make a major RTO policy decision–based on feelings of annoyance about employee badge swipes!</p>



<p>In <a href="https://disasteravoidanceexperts.com/consulting" target="_self" rel="">my discussions</a> with five to 10 corporate leaders each week about best practices for <a href="https://disasteravoidanceexperts.com/hybrid" target="_self" rel="">RTO policies</a>, I hear many similar stories. Most CEOs tell me they decided on their RTO approach based primarily on discussing their intuitions about what works best with other corporate leaders. That’s a textbook example of <a href="https://disasteravoidanceexperts.com/nevergut/" target="_self" rel="">confirmation bias</a>–a <a href="https://www.top10.com/dating/top-10-cognitive-biases-to-avoid-in-dating" target="_self" rel="">cognitive bias</a> where we look for information that confirms our beliefs, and ignore information that doesn’t.</p>



<h2><a href="" target="_self" rel=""></a>Confirmation bias and RTO</h2>



<p>Why didn’t Jassy–or these other leaders–talk to the <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/08/29/atlassian-ceo-scott-farquhar-office-once-a-quarter-remote-work/#:~:text=Farquhar%20himself%20is%20worth%20%2411.7%20billion%2C%20according%20to%20estimates%20from%20Bloomberg." target="_self" rel="">CEO</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ExwGryS_FY" target="_self" rel="">CHRO</a> of <a href="https://fortune.com/company/atlassian/" target="_blank" rel="">Atlassian</a> about how well their famous remote model works? Because they would have provided data that contradicts these beliefs.</p>



<p>Yet CEOs keep getting surprised by the negative consequences of their echo-chamber-driven RTO decisions. In May, <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/05/31/amazon-employee-walk-protest-climate-rto-policies/" target="_self" rel="">hundreds</a> of Amazon employees walked out on their first RTO day from the company’s Seattle headquarters during the lunch hour, with signs like “Hell no, RTO!” Following the latest announcement, more than 30,000 employees joined a new Slack channel called “remote advocacy” shortly after the announcement and <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/08/29/amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-return-to-office-mandate-or-face-consequences/" target="_self" rel="">organized a petition</a>. In the petition, Amazon employees argued, based on research, that remote work improved productivity, recruitment, work/life balance, inclusion efforts, and reduced corporate expenses.</p>



<p>Andy Jassy’s judgment call rejected this data-driven approach, preferring instead to rely on the CEO echo chamber. That’s despite Amazon’s stock performance, which doubled during the pandemic’s remote work era. The dissonance between stock performance and the leadership’s discontent shows the gap between perceptions and reality around RTO.</p>



<p>We know that the perils of echo-chamber-driven approaches to RTO are not simply evident from case studies like with Amazon. A whopping 80% of bosses reported that they regret their initial return-to-office decisions, according to new research from Envoy, which interviewed more than 1,000 U.S. company executives and workplace managers who work in person at least one day per week.</p>



<p>Leaders said they’d do things differently if they knew more about how often employees actually show up at the office and use the amenities. Some are scratching their heads trying to figure out if their in-office policies are even working. Others are finding it tough to lock in long-term property deals without a clue about how their teams will feel about coming into the office down the road. Larry Gadea, Envoy’s CEO and founder, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/11/80percent-of-bosses-say-they-regret-earlier-return-to-office-plans.html" target="_self" rel="">said </a>“many companies are realizing they could have been a lot more measured in their approach, rather than making big, bold, very controversial decisions based on executives’ opinions rather than employee data.”</p>



<p>Or consider another data point, Unispace’s <em>Returning for Good</em> <a href="https://www.unispace.com/returning-for-good" target="_self" rel="">report</a>. Unispace discovered that a surprising 42% of firms with back-to-office rules saw more people quitting than they’d expected. Additionally, about 29% of these companies are having a hard time hiring new talent. So, while bosses knew pushing folks back into the office would shake things up, they didn’t see the big headaches coming.</p>



<p>Unispace adds a twist: it’s all about options. Their study shows that generally, employees say they’re happy (31%), motivated (30%), and excited (27%) to be back at the desk. But those good vibes dip when going back isn’t optional–dropping to 27%, 26%, and 22% respectively. So, people are more into the office comeback when it’s their call, not a mandate. That benefit of optionality is the same thing I find when gathering data from more than two dozen <a href="https://disasteravoidanceexperts.com/client-list/" target="_self" rel="">organizations</a> that I helped figure out their approach to RTO.</p>



<h2><a href="" target="_self" rel=""></a>Do all RTOs fail to use data?</h2>



<p>Far from all CEOs rely on intuition and the echo chamber in the return to office. In fact, (surprise, surprise) some actually use data. For example, Marc Benioff, the CEO of <a href="https://fortune.com/company/salesforce-com/" target="_blank" rel="">Salesforce</a>, <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/03/07/salesforce-ceo-marc-benioff-remote-work-in-office-mandate-productivity/" target="_self" rel="">said</a> that “for our new employees who are coming in, we know empirically that they do better if they’re in the office, meeting people, being onboarded, being trained. If they are at home and not going through that process, we don’t think they’re as successful.”</p>



<p>Benioff’s comments are supported by the data. A Harvard University working <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/pallais/publications/power-proximity-coworkers-training-tomorrow-or-productivity-today" target="_self" rel="">paper</a> studied software engineers at a Fortune 500 company with a main campus spread across two buildings separated by several blocks. The research focused on the impact of physical proximity on feedback, coding output, and retention.</p>



<p>The findings? Engineers who shared a building with all their teammates received 22% more online feedback compared to those who were further apart. However, once the pandemic closed offices, this edge mostly vanished, shrinking to just an 8% advantage in feedback. Interestingly, being in the same location seemed to cut programming output by 24%. This dip was even more pronounced for senior engineers, who saw a 39% drop, largely because they spent more time giving feedback to others. So, while close quarters can boost communication, they may also come with a cost to productivity–especially for the more experienced folks on the team. However, the study found that proximity helped junior folks succeed in the long run. And that’s a fair call for Salesforce to make.</p>



<p>More broadly, Salesforce is adopting a differentiated approach to hybrid work, with different amounts of in-office time not simply for staff with different tenure at the company, but also for different roles. Engineers are looking at just 10 days in the office per quarter, while admin folks need to show up three days a week. Sales and marketing teams need to be in the office four days a week unless they’re out hustling deals. Benioff, won’t even label their setup as a mandate. “I don’t want to force anybody,” he said, warning that pushing the issue too strongly would lead to an outflow of talent. “We don’t want to lose our stars.”</p>



<p>Instead of mandates, Benioff aims to make the office a place people want to be. He’s keeping the door open for employees to negotiate full remote status with their bosses. But he also made it clear that there will always be roles that require some face time.</p>



<p>While that’s not a perfect approach to RTO, it’s much better than most. It hits one of the three required elements of a truly effective RTO: customizing it to your organization’s needs. After all, as Benioff rightly points out, different roles have divergent needs for being in the office. Engineers might only need to come in 10 days a quarter, perhaps at the start and end of a sprint. Admin staff–whose job involves office management–need to cover office duties like helping people with copiers or receiving visitors, so you should make sure there’s always an admin to cover such needs. Accountants can come in a couple of days at the end of the month to close the books and for a week at the end of the quarter.</p>



<p>Just demanding a set number of days per week–as the large majority of major corporate giants have done–is a sign of laziness and conformism. The company’s leaders and HR failed to think through who needs to be in the office and for what purpose. Employees feel a lot of resentment when they come to the office without a good reason to be there, doing the same thing they would do at home.</p>



<h2><a href="" target="_self" rel=""></a>What a data-driven RTO looks like</h2>



<p>Salesforce unfortunately lacked two other key elements of a data-driven RTO: assessing employee opinions and getting their buy-in. Both of these problems are solved with similar tools, killing two birds with one stone.</p>



<p>First, you need to survey your staff on RTO–ideally before the RTO, or after it if you already launched the RTO. At all the companies I <a href="https://disasteravoidanceexperts.com/consulting" target="_self" rel="">worked</a> with to help guide their RTO, whether it’s from the start of the process or to refine it after RTO was already launched, we started with a thorough survey of staff opinions about remote work and the return to office. That survey involves questions around their preferences on RTO, intent to stay with various versions of RTO, whether they would recommend working here to their peers given these versions, their productivity on individual and collaborative tasks at home vs. in the office, and similar questions on well-being, happiness, morale, stress, and so on. The survey is available in the appendix of my best-selling book, <a href="https://disasteravoidanceexperts.com/hybrid/" target="_self" rel=""><em>Returning to the Office and Leading Hybrid and Remote Teams</em></a>.</p>



<p>Next, you’ll want to run focus groups. Choose representative staff from a variety of departments, both rank-and-file and managers at all levels of the organization. Make sure to avoid putting managers together with rank-and-file staff in focus groups, as many employees might be reluctant to be fully transparent when those in managerial roles are in the meeting.</p>



<p>Focus groups offer invaluable qualitative data, diving deeper into the “why” behind survey responses. They let you explore nuanced issues like work-life balance, home office setups, and team dynamics that a survey might not fully capture. This is where you can dig into some of the nuanced issues that a survey might not fully capture. For example, why do some employees prefer hybrid work over fully remote? Is it the office amenities, the team camaraderie, or something else? These sessions should ideally be run by a neutral party to encourage candid conversation and, with participant consent, be recorded for later analysis.</p>



<p>Once you’ve gathered this rich data, the next step is synthesis. Combine the qualitative insights from the focus groups with the quantitative metrics from the surveys. This dual approach not only informs the RTO strategy with a well-rounded perspective but also makes it deeply empathetic to employees’ needs and preferences.</p>



<p>Closing the loop is crucial. Share with employees the actionable steps you’ll take based on these discussions. Even if they don’t fully agree with the final decision, this transparent process makes them feel heard, listened to, and consulted.</p>



<p>The result? A significantly higher level of buy-in and reduced resistance to the RTO plan, as employees will feel that their opinions were genuinely considered in shaping the company’s future. Thus, unlike at Amazon, you won’t have employees leaking recordings of internal company meetings to the media and otherwise getting media involved in your company’s business. You also won’t have employees walking out and publicly protesting or signing mass petitions. None of that happened at any of my clients–because the employees felt listened to, respected, and heard, and because RTO policies were customized to the needs of each team and role.</p>



<p>Amazon illustrates the shortcomings of echo-chamber-driven RTO, characterized by employee resistance and low morale. In contrast, a nuanced, <a href="https://disasteravoidanceexperts.com/hybrid" target="_self" rel="">data-driven RTO approach</a> provides a balanced and empathetic strategy. Given that research on CEO plans for the future by Nick Bloom and other scholars indicates that there will be <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/08/31/remote-work-hybrid-to-grow-despite-return-to-office-push/" target="_self" rel="">more remote work</a>, not less, it seems that many leaders have learned that their initial RTO approach was wrong. Indeed, <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/08/14/bosses-regretting-return-to-office-mandates/" target="_self" rel="">Envoy finds</a> that over 80% of bosses regret their initial RTO plans, saying they wished they gathered more information and made data-driven decisions. By stepping out of the CEO echo chamber and engaging in meaningful dialogue with their workforce, companies can succeed in navigating the complexities of RTO.</p>

<p>Something happened to business software.</p>

<p>You used to pay for it <strong>once</strong>, install it, and run it. Whether on someone’s computer, or a server for everyone, it felt like you owned it. And you did.</p>

<p>Today, most software is a service. Not owned, but rented. Buying it enters you into a perpetual landlord–tenant agreement. Every month you pay for essentially the same thing you had last month. And if you stop paying, the software stops working. Boom, you’re evicted.</p>

<p>For nearly two decades, the SaaS model benefitted landlords handsomely. With routine prayers — and payers — to the Church of Recurring Revenue, valuations shot to the moon on the backs of businesses subscribed at luxury prices for commodity services they had little control over.</p>

<p>Add up your SaaS subscriptions last year. You should own that shit by now.</p>

<p>SaaS still makes sense for many products, but its grip will slip. Installation and administration used to be hopelessly complicated, but self–hosting tech is simpler now and vastly improved. Plus, IT departments are hungry to run their own IT again, tired of being subservient to Big Tech’s reign clouds.</p>

<p><strong>Once</strong> upon a time you owned what you paid for, you controlled what you depended on, and your privacy and security were your own business. We&nbsp;think it’s that time again.</p>

<p>Introducing <strong>ONCE</strong>, a new line of software products from <a href="https://37signals.com/" aria-label="37signals">37signals</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pay one time, own forever.</li>
  <li>We write the code, you get to see it.</li>
  <li>We give you the software, you get to host it.</li>
  <li>Simple and straightforward, not enterprisey and bloated.</li>
  <li>For one fixed price. <strong>Once</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>We’ll be launching the first product late 2023, with more coming in 2024.</p>

<p>In the early 2000s, we were among the early pioneers leading the industry into the SaaS revolution. Now, 20 years later, we intend to help lead the way out. The post–SaaS era is just around the corner.</p>

<p>Stay tuned.</p>

					<p>On July 11, 2023, Microsoft published a <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2023/07/microsoft-mitigates-china-based-threat-actor-storm-0558-targeting-of-customer-email/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> which details how the China-Based threat actor, Storm-0558, used an acquired Microsoft account (MSA) consumer key to forge tokens to access OWA and Outlook.com. Upon identifying that the threat actor had acquired the consumer key, Microsoft performed a comprehensive technical investigation into the acquisition of the Microsoft account consumer signing key, including how it was used to access enterprise email. Our technical investigation has concluded. As part of our commitment to transparency and trust, we are releasing our investigation findings.</p>

    </h2>
<p>Microsoft maintains a highly isolated and restricted production environment. Controls for Microsoft employee access to production infrastructure include background checks, dedicated accounts, secure access workstations, and multi-factor authentication using hardware token devices. Controls in this environment also prevent the use of email, conferencing, web research and other collaboration tools which can lead to common account compromise vectors such as malware infections or phishing, as well as restricting access to systems and data using Just in Time and Just Enough Access policies.</p>
<p>Our corporate environment, which also requires secure authentication and secure devices, allows for email, conferencing, web research and other collaboration tools. While these tools are important, they also make users vulnerable to spear phishing, token stealing malware, and other account compromise vectors. For this reason - by policy and as part of our Zero-Trust and “assume breach” mindset - key material should not leave our production environment.</p>
<p>Our investigation found that a consumer signing system crash in April of 2021 resulted in a snapshot of the crashed process (“crash dump”). The crash dumps, which redact sensitive information, should not include the signing key. In this case, a race condition allowed the key to be present in the crash dump (this issue has been corrected). The key material’s presence in the crash dump was not detected by our systems (this issue has been corrected).</p>
<p>We found that this crash dump, believed at the time not to contain key material, was subsequently moved from the isolated production network into our debugging environment on the internet connected corporate network. This is consistent with our standard debugging processes. Our credential scanning methods did not detect its presence (this issue has been corrected).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>After April 2021, when the key was leaked to the corporate environment in the crash dump, the Storm-0558 actor was able to successfully compromise a Microsoft engineer’s corporate account. This account had access to the debugging environment containing the crash dump which incorrectly contained the key. Due to log retention policies, we don’t have logs with specific evidence of this exfiltration by this actor, but this was the most probable mechanism by which the actor acquired the key.</p>

        <a href="#why-a-consumer-key-was-able-to-access-enterprise-mail">Why a consumer key was able to access enterprise mail</a>
    </h2>
<p>To meet growing customer demand to support applications which work with both consumer and enterprise applications, Microsoft <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/for-developers-the-first-use-cases-of-the-converged-microsoft/ba-p/244232" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced</a> a common key metadata publishing endpoint in September 2018. As part of this converged offering, Microsoft updated documentation to clarify the requirements for key scope validation – which key to use for enterprise accounts, and which to use for consumer accounts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of a pre-existing library of documentation and helper APIs, Microsoft provided an API to help validate the signatures cryptographically but did not update these libraries to perform this scope validation automatically (this issue has been corrected). The mail systems were updated to use the common metadata endpoint in 2022. Developers in the mail system incorrectly assumed libraries performed complete validation and did not add the required issuer/scope validation. Thus, the mail system would accept a request for enterprise email using a security token signed with the consumer key (this issue has been corrected using the updated libraries).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Microsoft is continuously hardening systems as part of our defense in depth strategy. Investments which have been made related to MSA key management are covered in the <a href="https://aka.ms/storm-0558" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://aka.ms/storm-0558</a> blog. Items detailed in this blog are a subset of these overall investments. We are summarizing the improvements specific to these findings here for clarity:</p>

<li>
<p>Identified and resolved race Condition that allowed the signing key to be present in crash dumps</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enhanced prevention, detection, and response for key material erroneously included in crash dumps</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enhanced credential scanning to better detect presence of signing key in the debugging environment</p>

<dd>
<p>Cristina Criddle, Anna Gross, and John Aglionby, reporting from London for The Financial Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The UK government has conceded it will not use controversial
powers in the online safety bill to scan messaging apps for
harmful content until it is “technically feasible” to do so,
postponing measures that critics say threaten users’ privacy.</p>

<p>In a statement to the House of Lords on Wednesday afternoon,
junior arts and heritage minister Lord Stephen Parkinson sought to
mark an eleventh-hour effort to end a stand-off with tech
companies, including WhatsApp, that have threatened to pull their
services from the UK over what they claimed was an intolerable
threat to millions of users’ privacy and security.</p>

<p>Parkinson said that Ofcom, the tech regulator, would only require
companies to scan their networks when a technology is developed
that is capable of doing so. Many security experts believe it
could be years before any such technology is developed, if ever.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>No, Thursday’s out. How about never — <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoons/bob-mankoff/the-story-of-how-about-never">is never good for you</a>?</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>WhatsApp, owned by Facebook’s parent Meta, and Signal, another
popular encrypted messaging app, are among those that have
threatened to exit the UK market should they be ordered to weaken
encryption, a widely used security technology that allows only
the sender and recipient of messages to view a message’s
contents. [...]</p>

<p>Officials have privately acknowledged to tech companies that there
is no current technology able to scan end-to-end encrypted
messages that would not also undermine users’ privacy, according
to several people briefed on the government’s thinking.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This isn’t the worst reporting on encryption and lawmakers’ fantasies about “backdoors only accessible by the good guys”, but it’s fundamentally misleading. End-to-end encryption’s meaning is right there in its name. There’s no dial that can be adjusted from “weak” to “strong”. There’s no option for content inspection between end points. It’s not about choosing not to allow eavesdroppers, it’s about implementing protocols where it’s technically impossible to inspect content between sender and receiver.</p>

<p>The actual math is far more complex, but ultimately this boils down to the U.K. acknowledging that 2 + 2 can only equal 4.</p>

            <p>MIT researchers have demonstrated the first system for ultra-low-power underwater networking and communication, which can transmit signals across kilometer-scale distances.</p>

<p>This technique, which the researchers began developing several years ago, uses about one-millionth the power that existing underwater communication methods use. By expanding their battery-free system’s communication range, the researchers have made the technology more feasible for applications such as aquaculture, coastal hurricane prediction, and climate change modeling.</p>

<p>“What started as a very exciting intellectual idea a few years ago — underwater communication with a million times lower power — is now practical and realistic. There are still a few interesting technical challenges to address, but there is a clear path from where we are now to deployment,” says Fadel Adib, associate professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and director of the Signal Kinetics group in the MIT Media Lab.</p>

<p>Underwater backscatter enables low-power communication by encoding data in sound waves that it reflects, or scatters, back toward a receiver. These innovations enable reflected signals to be more precisely directed at their source.</p>

<p>Due to this “retrodirectivity,” less signal scatters in the wrong directions, allowing for more efficient and longer-range communication.</p>

<p>When tested in a river and an ocean, the retrodirective device exhibited a communication range that was more than 15 times farther than previous devices. However, the experiments were limited by the length of the docks available to the researchers.</p>

<p>To better understand the limits of underwater backscatter, the team also developed an analytical model to predict the technology’s maximum range. The model, which they validated using experimental data, showed that their retrodirective system could communicate across kilometer-scale distances.</p>

<p>The researchers shared these findings in two papers which will be presented at this year’s ACM SIGCOMM and MobiCom conferences. Adib, senior author on both papers, is joined on <a href="https://www.mit.edu/~fadel/papers/VAB-paper.pdf" target="_blank">the SIGCOMM paper</a> by co-lead authors Aline Eid, a former postdoc who is now an assistant professor at the University of Michigan, and Jack Rademacher, a research assistant; as well as research assistants Waleed Akbar and Purui Wang, and postdoc Ahmed Allam. The <a href="http://www.mit.edu/~fadel/papers/PAB-theory-paper.pdf" target="_blank">MobiCom paper</a> is also written by co-lead authors Akbar and Allam.</p>

<p><strong>Communicating with sound waves</strong></p>

<p>Underwater backscatter communication devices utilize an array of nodes made from “piezoelectric” materials to receive and reflect sound waves. These materials produce an electric signal when mechanical force is applied to them.</p>

<p>When sound waves strike the nodes, they vibrate and convert the mechanical energy to an electric charge. The nodes use that charge to scatter some of the acoustic energy back to the source, transmitting data that a receiver decodes based on the sequence of reflections.</p>

<p>But because the backscattered signal travels in all directions, only a small fraction reaches the source, reducing the signal strength and limiting the communication range.</p>

<p>To overcome this challenge, the researchers leveraged a 70-year-old radio device called a Van Atta array, in which symmetric pairs of antennas are connected in such a way that the array reflects energy back in the direction it came from.</p>

<p>But connecting piezoelectric nodes to make a Van Atta array reduces their efficiency. The researchers avoided this problem by placing a transformer between pairs of connected nodes. The transformer, which transfers electric energy from one circuit to another, allows the nodes to reflect the maximum amount of energy back to the source.</p>

<p>“Both nodes are receiving and both nodes are reflecting, so it is a very interesting system. As you increase the number of elements in that system, you build an array that allows you to achieve much longer communication ranges,” Eid explains.</p>

<p>In addition, they used a technique called cross-polarity switching to encode binary data in the reflected signal. Each node has a positive and a negative terminal (like a car battery), so when the positive terminals of two nodes are connected and the negative terminals of two nodes are connected, that reflected signal is a “bit one.”</p>

<p>But if the researchers switch the polarity, and the negative and positive terminals are connected to each other instead, then the reflection is a “bit zero.”</p>

<p>“Just connecting the piezoelectric nodes together is not enough. By alternating the polarities between the two nodes, we are able to transmit data back to the remote receiver,” Rademacher explains.</p>

<p>When building the Van Atta array, the researchers found that if the connected nodes were too close, they would block each other’s signals. They devised a new design with staggered nodes that enables signals to reach the array from any direction. With this scalable design, the more nodes an array has, the greater its communication range.</p>

<p>They tested the array in more than 1,500 experimental trials in the Charles River in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and in the Atlantic Ocean, off the coast of Falmouth, Massachusetts, in collaboration with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. The device achieved communication ranges of 300 meters, more than 15 times longer than they previously demonstrated.</p>

<p>However, they had to cut the experiments short because they ran out of space on the dock.</p>

<p><strong>Modeling the maximum</strong></p>

<p>That inspired the researchers to build an analytical model to determine the theoretical and practical communication limits of this new underwater backscatter technology.</p>

<p>Building off their group’s work on RFIDs, the team carefully crafted a model that captured the impact of system parameters, like the size of the piezoelectric nodes and the input power of the signal, on the underwater operation range of the device.</p>

<p>“It is not a traditional communication technology, so you need to understand how you can quantify the reflection. What are the roles of the different components in that process?” Akbar says.</p>

<p>For instance, the researchers needed to derive a function that captures the amount of signal reflected out of an underwater piezoelectric node with a specific size, which was among the biggest challenges of developing the model, he adds.</p>

<p>They used these insights to create a plug-and-play model into a which a user could enter information like input power and piezoelectric node dimensions and receive an output that shows the expected range of the system.</p>

<p>They evaluated the model on data from their experimental trials and found that it could accurately predict the range of retrodirected acoustic signals with an average error of less than one decibel.</p>

<p>Using this model, they showed that an underwater backscatter array can potentially achieve kilometer-long communication ranges.</p>

<p>“We are creating a new ocean technology and propelling it into the realm of the things we have been doing for 6G cellular networks. For us, it is very rewarding because we are starting to see this now very close to reality,” Adib says.</p>

<p>The researchers plan to continue studying underwater backscatter Van Atta arrays, perhaps using boats so they could evaluate longer communication ranges. Along the way, they intend to release tools and datasets so other researchers can build on their work. At the same time, they are beginning to move toward commercialization of this technology.</p>

<p>“Limited range has been an open problem in underwater backscatter networks, preventing them from being used in real-world applications. This paper takes a significant step forward in the future of underwater communication, by enabling them to operate on minimum energy while achieving long range,” says Omid Abari, assistant professor of computer science at the University of California at Los Angeles, who was not involved with this work. “The paper is the first to bring Van Atta Reflector array technique into underwater backscatter settings and demonstrate its benefits in improving the communication range by orders of magnitude. This can take battery-free underwater communication one step closer to reality, enabling applications such as underwater climate change monitoring and coastal monitoring.”</p>

<p>This research was funded, in part, by the Office of Naval Research, the Sloan Research Fellowship, the National Science Foundation, the MIT Media Lab, and the Doherty Chair in Ocean Utilization.</p>

<p>Albert Einstein is the world-famous physicist. This article was originally published in the first issue of <em>Monthly Review</em> (May 1949). It was subsequently published in May 1998 to commemorate the first issue of <em>MR</em>‘s fiftieth year.</p>

</div>
<p>Is it advisable for one who is not an expert on economic and social issues to express views on the subject of socialism? I believe for a number of reasons that it is.</p>
<p>Let us first consider the question from the point of view of scientific knowledge. It might appear that there are no essential methodological differences between astronomy and economics: scientists in both fields attempt to discover laws of general acceptability for a circumscribed group of phenomena in order to make the interconnection of these phenomena as clearly understandable as possible. But in reality such methodological differences do exist. The discovery of general laws in the field of economics is made difficult by the circumstance that observed economic phenomena are often affected by many factors which are very hard to evaluate separately. In addition, the experience which has accumulated since the beginning of the so-called civilized period of human history has—as is well known—been largely influenced and limited by causes which are by no means exclusively economic in nature. For example, most of the major states of history owed their existence to conquest. The conquering peoples established themselves, legally and economically, as the privileged class of the conquered country. They seized for themselves a monopoly of the land ownership and appointed a priesthood from among their own ranks. The priests, in control of education, made the class division of society into a permanent institution and created a system of values by which the people were thenceforth, to a large extent unconsciously, guided in their social behavior.</p>
<p>But historic tradition is, so to speak, of yesterday; nowhere have we really overcome what Thorstein Veblen called “the predatory phase” of human development. The observable economic facts belong to that phase and even such laws as we can derive from them are not applicable to other phases. Since the real purpose of socialism is precisely to overcome and advance beyond the predatory phase of human development, economic science in its present state can throw little light on the socialist society of the future.</p>
<p>Second, socialism is directed towards a social-ethical end. Science, however, cannot create ends and, even less, instill them in human beings; science, at most, can supply the means by which to attain certain ends. But the ends themselves are conceived by personalities with lofty ethical ideals and—if these ends are not stillborn, but vital and vigorous—are adopted and carried forward by those many human beings who, half unconsciously, determine the slow evolution of society.</p>
<p>For these reasons, we should be on our guard not to overestimate science and scientific methods when it is a question of human problems; and we should not assume that experts are the only ones who have a right to express themselves on questions affecting the organization of society.</p>
<p>Innumerable voices have been asserting for some time now that human society is passing through a crisis, that its stability has been gravely shattered. It is characteristic of such a situation that individuals feel indifferent or even hostile toward the group, small or large, to which they belong. In order to illustrate my meaning, let me record here a personal experience. I recently discussed with an intelligent and well-disposed man the threat of another war, which in my opinion would seriously endanger the existence of mankind, and I remarked that only a supra-national organization would offer protection from that danger. Thereupon my visitor, very calmly and coolly, said to me: “Why are you so deeply opposed to the disappearance of the human race?”</p>
<p>I am sure that as little as a century ago no one would have so lightly made a statement of this kind. It is the statement of a man who has striven in vain to attain an equilibrium within himself and has more or less lost hope of succeeding. It is the expression of a painful solitude and isolation from which so many people are suffering in these days. What is the cause? Is there a way out?</p>
<p>It is easy to raise such questions, but difficult to answer them with any degree of assurance. I must try, however, as best I can, although I am very conscious of the fact that our feelings and strivings are often contradictory and obscure and that they cannot be expressed in easy and simple formulas.</p>
<p>Man is, at one and the same time, a solitary being and a social being. As a solitary being, he attempts to protect his own existence and that of those who are closest to him, to satisfy his personal desires, and to develop his innate abilities. As a social being, he seeks to gain the recognition and affection of his fellow human beings, to share in their pleasures, to comfort them in their sorrows, and to improve their conditions of life. Only the existence of these varied, frequently conflicting, strivings accounts for the special character of a man, and their specific combination determines the extent to which an individual can achieve an inner equilibrium and can contribute to the well-being of society. It is quite possible that the relative strength of these two drives is, in the main, fixed by inheritance. But the personality that finally emerges is largely formed by the environment in which a man happens to find himself during his development, by the structure of the society in which he grows up, by the tradition of that society, and by its appraisal of particular types of behavior. The abstract concept “society” means to the individual human being the sum total of his direct and indirect relations to his contemporaries and to all the people of earlier generations. The individual is able to think, feel, strive, and work by himself; but he depends so much upon society—in his physical, intellectual, and emotional existence—that it is impossible to think of him, or to understand him, outside the framework of society. It is “society” which provides man with food, clothing, a home, the tools of work, language, the forms of thought, and most of the content of thought; his life is made possible through the labor and the accomplishments of the many millions past and present who are all hidden behind the small word “society.”</p>
<p>It is evident, therefore, that the dependence of the individual upon society is a fact of nature which cannot be abolished—just as in the case of ants and bees. However, while the whole life process of ants and bees is fixed down to the smallest detail by rigid, hereditary instincts, the social pattern and interrelationships of human beings are very variable and susceptible to change. Memory, the capacity to make new combinations, the gift of oral communication have made possible developments among human being which are not dictated by biological necessities. Such developments manifest themselves in traditions, institutions, and organizations; in literature; in scientific and engineering accomplishments; in works of art. This explains how it happens that, in a certain sense, man can influence his life through his own conduct, and that in this process conscious thinking and wanting can play a part.</p>
<p>Man acquires at birth, through heredity, a biological constitution which we must consider fixed and unalterable, including the natural urges which are characteristic of the human species. In addition, during his lifetime, he acquires a cultural constitution which he adopts from society through communication and through many other types of influences. It is this cultural constitution which, with the passage of time, is subject to change and which determines to a very large extent the relationship between the individual and society. Modern anthropology has taught us, through comparative investigation of so-called primitive cultures, that the social behavior of human beings may differ greatly, depending upon prevailing cultural patterns and the types of organization which predominate in society. It is on this that those who are striving to improve the lot of man may ground their hopes: human beings are not condemned, because of their biological constitution, to annihilate each other or to be at the mercy of a cruel, self-inflicted fate.</p>
<p>If we ask ourselves how the structure of society and the cultural attitude of man should be changed in order to make human life as satisfying as possible, we should constantly be conscious of the fact that there are certain conditions which we are unable to modify. As mentioned before, the biological nature of man is, for all practical purposes, not subject to change. Furthermore, technological and demographic developments of the last few centuries have created conditions which are here to stay. In relatively densely settled populations with the goods which are indispensable to their continued existence, an extreme division of labor and a highly-centralized productive apparatus are absolutely necessary. The time—which, looking back, seems so idyllic—is gone forever when individuals or relatively small groups could be completely self-sufficient. It is only a slight exaggeration to say that mankind constitutes even now a planetary community of production and consumption.</p>
<p>I have now reached the point where I may indicate briefly what to me constitutes the essence of the crisis of our time. It concerns the relationship of the individual to society. The individual has become more conscious than ever of his dependence upon society. But he does not experience this dependence as a positive asset, as an organic tie, as a protective force, but rather as a threat to his natural rights, or even to his economic existence. Moreover, his position in society is such that the egotistical drives of his make-up are constantly being accentuated, while his social drives, which are by nature weaker, progressively deteriorate. All human beings, whatever their position in society, are suffering from this process of deterioration. Unknowingly prisoners of their own egotism, they feel insecure, lonely, and deprived of the naive, simple, and unsophisticated enjoyment of life. Man can find meaning in life, short and perilous as it is, only through devoting himself to society.</p>
<p>The economic anarchy of capitalist society as it exists today is, in my opinion, the real source of the evil. We see before us a huge community of producers the members of which are unceasingly striving to deprive each other of the fruits of their collective labor—not by force, but on the whole in faithful compliance with legally established rules. In this respect, it is important to realize that the means of production—that is to say, the entire productive capacity that is needed for producing consumer goods as well as additional capital goods—may legally be, and for the most part are, the private property of individuals.</p>
<p>For the sake of simplicity, in the discussion that follows I shall call “workers” all those who do not share in the ownership of the means of production—although this does not quite correspond to the customary use of the term. The owner of the means of production is in a position to purchase the labor power of the worker. By using the means of production, the worker produces new goods which become the property of the capitalist. The essential point about this process is the relation between what the worker produces and what he is paid, both measured in terms of real value. Insofar as the labor contract is “free,” what the worker receives is determined not by the real value of the goods he produces, but by his minimum needs and by the capitalists’ requirements for labor power in relation to the number of workers competing for jobs. It is important to understand that even in theory the payment of the worker is not determined by the value of his product.</p>
<p>Private capital tends to become concentrated in few hands, partly because of competition among the capitalists, and partly because technological development and the increasing division of labor encourage the formation of larger units of production at the expense of smaller ones. The result of these developments is an oligarchy of private capital the enormous power of which cannot be effectively checked even by a democratically organized political society. This is true since the members of legislative bodies are selected by political parties, largely financed or otherwise influenced by private capitalists who, for all practical purposes, separate the electorate from the legislature. The consequence is that the representatives of the people do not in fact sufficiently protect the interests of the underprivileged sections of the population. Moreover, under existing conditions, private capitalists inevitably control, directly or indirectly, the main sources of information (press, radio, education). It is thus extremely difficult, and indeed in most cases quite impossible, for the individual citizen to come to objective conclusions and to make intelligent use of his political rights.</p>
<p>The situation prevailing in an economy based on the private ownership of capital is thus characterized by two main principles: first, means of production (capital) are privately owned and the owners dispose of them as they see fit; second, the labor contract is free. Of course, there is no such thing as a <em>pure </em>capitalist society in this sense. In particular, it should be noted that the workers, through long and bitter political struggles, have succeeded in securing a somewhat improved form of the “free labor contract” for certain categories of workers. But taken as a whole, the present day economy does not differ much from “pure” capitalism.</p>
<p>Production is carried on for profit, not for use. There is no provision that all those able and willing to work will always be in a position to find employment; an “army of unemployed” almost always exists. The worker is constantly in fear of losing his job. Since unemployed and poorly paid workers do not provide a profitable market, the production of consumers’ goods is restricted, and great hardship is the consequence. Technological progress frequently results in more unemployment rather than in an easing of the burden of work for all. The profit motive, in conjunction with competition among capitalists, is responsible for an instability in the accumulation and utilization of capital which leads to increasingly severe depressions. Unlimited competition leads to a huge waste of labor, and to that crippling of the social consciousness of individuals which I mentioned before.</p>
<p>This crippling of individuals I consider the worst evil of capitalism. Our whole educational system suffers from this evil. An exaggerated competitive attitude is inculcated into the student, who is trained to worship acquisitive success as a preparation for his future career.</p>
<p>I am convinced there is only <em>one </em>way to eliminate these grave evils, namely through the establishment of a socialist economy, accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals. In such an economy, the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion. A planned economy, which adjusts production to the needs of the community, would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man, woman, and child. The education of the individual, in addition to promoting his own innate abilities, would attempt to develop in him a sense of responsibility for his fellow men in place of the glorification of power and success in our present society.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is necessary to remember that a planned economy is not yet socialism. A planned economy as such may be accompanied by the complete enslavement of the individual. The achievement of socialism requires the solution of some extremely difficult socio-political problems: how is it possible, in view of the far-reaching centralization of political and economic power, to prevent bureaucracy from becoming all-powerful and overweening? How can the rights of the individual be protected and therewith a democratic counterweight to the power of bureaucracy be assured?</p>
<p>Clarity about the aims and problems of socialism is of greatest significance in our age of transition. Since, under present circumstances, free and unhindered discussion of these problems has come under a powerful taboo, I consider the foundation of this magazine to be an important public service.</p>

						<p><i><span size="1">[Content warning: Politics, religion, social justice, spoilers for “The Secret of Father Brown”. This isn’t especially original to me and I don’t claim anything more than to be explaining and rewording things I have heard from a bunch of other people. Unapologetically America-centric because I’m not informed enough to make it otherwise. Try to keep this off Reddit and other similar sorts of things.]</span></i></p>
<p><b>I.</b></p>
<p>In Chesterton’s <i>The Secret of Father Brown</i>, a beloved nobleman who murdered his good-for-nothing brother in a duel thirty years ago returns to his hometown wracked by guilt. All the townspeople want to forgive him immediately, and they mock the titular priest for only being willing to give a measured forgiveness conditional on penance and self-reflection. They lecture the priest on the virtues of charity and compassion.</p>
<p>Later, it comes out that the beloved nobleman did <i>not</i> in fact kill his good-for-nothing brother. The good-for-nothing brother killed the beloved nobleman (and stole his identity). <i>Now</i> the townspeople want to see him lynched or burned alive, and it is only the priest who – consistently – offers a measured forgiveness conditional on penance and self-reflection.</p>
<p>The priest tells them:</p>
<blockquote><p>It seems to me that you only pardon the sins that you don’t really think sinful. You only forgive criminals when they commit what you don’t regard as crimes, but rather as conventions. You forgive a conventional duel just as you forgive a conventional divorce. You forgive because there isn’t anything to be forgiven.</p></blockquote>
<p>He further notes that this is why the townspeople can self-righteously consider themselves more compassionate and forgiving than he is. Actual forgiveness, the kind the priest needs to cultivate to forgive evildoers, is really really hard. The fake forgiveness the townspeople use to forgive the people they like is really easy, so they get to boast not only of their forgiving nature, but of how much nicer they are than those mean old priests who find forgiveness difficult and want penance along with it.</p>
<p>After some thought I agree with Chesterton’s point. There are a lot of people who say “I forgive you” when they mean “No harm done”, and a lot of people who say “That was unforgiveable” when they mean “That was genuinely really bad”. Whether or not forgiveness is <i>right</i> is a complicated topic I do not want to get in here. But since forgiveness is generally considered a virtue, and one that many want credit for having, I think it’s fair to say you only earn the right to call yourself ‘forgiving’ if you forgive things that genuinely hurt you. </p>
<p>To borrow Chesterton’s example, if you think divorce is a-ok, then you don’t get to “forgive” people their divorces, you merely ignore them. Someone who thinks divorce is abhorrent can “forgive” divorce. <i>You</i> can forgive theft, or murder, or tax evasion, or something <i>you</i> find abhorrent.</p>
<p>I mean, from a utilitarian point of view, you are still doing the correct action of not giving people grief because they’re a divorcee. You can have all the Utility Points you want. All I’m saying is that if you “forgive” something you don’t care about, you don’t earn any Virtue Points. </p>
<p>(by way of illustration: a billionaire who gives $100 to charity gets as many Utility Points as an impoverished pensioner who donates the same amount, but the latter gets a lot more Virtue Points)</p>
<p>Tolerance is also considered a virtue, but it suffers the same sort of dimished expectations forgiveness does.</p>
<p>The Emperor <a href="http://poetrychina.net/Story_of_Zen/zenstory3a.htm">summons before him</a> Bodhidharma and asks: “Master, I have been tolerant of innumerable gays, lesbians, bisexuals, asexuals, blacks, Hispanics, Asians, transgender people, and Jews. How many Virtue Points have I earned for my meritorious deeds?”</p>
<p>Bodhidharma answers: “None at all”.</p>
<p>The Emperor, somewhat put out, demands to know why.</p>
<p>Bodhidharma asks: “Well, what do you think of gay people?”</p>
<p>The Emperor answers: “What do you think I am, some kind of homophobic bigot? Of course I have nothing against gay people!”</p>
<p>And Bodhidharma answers: “Thus do you gain no merit by tolerating them!”</p>
<p><b>II.</b></p>
<p>If I had to define “tolerance” it would be something like “respect and kindness toward members of an outgroup”.</p>
<p>And today we have an almost unprecedented situation.</p>
<p>We have a lot of people – like the Emperor – boasting of being able to tolerate everyone from every outgroup they can imagine, loving the outgroup, writing long paeans to how great the outgroup is, staying up at night fretting that somebody else might not like the outgroup enough.</p>
<p>This is really surprising. It’s a total reversal of everything we know about human psychology up to this point. No one did any genetic engineering. No one passed out weird glowing pills in the public schools. And yet suddenly we get an entire group of people who conspicuously promote and defend their outgroups, the outer the better.</p>
<p>What is going on here?</p>
<p>Let’s start by asking what exactly an outgroup is.</p>
<p>There’s a very boring sense in which, assuming the Emperor’s straight, gays are part of his “outgroup” ie a group that he is not a member of. But if the Emperor has curly hair, are straight-haired people part of his outgroup? If the Emperor’s name starts with the letter ‘A’, are people whose names start with the letter ‘B’ part of his outgroup?</p>
<p>Nah. I would differentiate between multiple different meanings of outgroup, where one is “a group you are not a part of” and the other is…something stronger.</p>
<p>I want to avoid a very easy trap, which is saying that outgroups are about how different you are, or how hostile you are. I don’t think that’s quite right.</p>
<p>Compare the Nazis to the German Jews and to the Japanese. The Nazis were very similar to the German Jews: they looked the same, spoke the same language, came from a similar culture. The Nazis were totally different from the Japanese: different race, different language, vast cultural gap. But the Nazis and Japanese mostly got along pretty well. Heck, the Nazis were actually moderately positively disposed to the <i>Chinese</i>, even when they were technically at war. Meanwhile, the conflict between the Nazis and the German Jews – some of whom didn’t even realize they were anything other than German until they checked their grandparents’ birth certificate – is the stuff of history and nightmares. Any theory of outgroupishness that naively assumes the Nazis’ natural outgroup is Japanese or Chinese people will be totally inadequate.</p>
<p>And this isn’t a weird exception. Freud spoke of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissism_of_small_differences">the narcissism of small differences</a>, saying that “it is precisely communities with adjoining territories, and related to each other in other ways as well, who are engaged in constant feuds and ridiculing each other”. Nazis and German Jews. Northern Irish Protestants and Northern Irish Catholics. Hutus and Tutsis. South African whites and South African blacks. Israeli Jews and Israeli Arabs. Anyone in the former Yugoslavia and anyone else in the former Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>So what makes an outgroup? Proximity plus small differences. If you want to know who someone in former Yugoslavia hates, don’t look at the Indonesians or the Zulus or the Tibetans or anyone else distant and exotic. Find the Yugoslavian ethnicity that lives closely intermingled with them and is most conspicuously similar to them, and chances are you’ll find the one who they have eight hundred years of seething hatred toward.</p>
<p>What makes an unexpected in-group? The answer with Germans and Japanese is obvious – a strategic alliance. In fact, the World Wars forged a lot of unexpected temporary pseudo-friendships. <a href="http://pando.com/2014/02/12/war-nerd-the-long-sleazy-history-behind-a-googlers-nonviolent-militia/">A recent article from War Nerd</a> points out that the British, after spending centuries subjugating and despising the Irish and Sikhs, suddenly needed Irish and Sikh soldiers for World Wars I and II respectively. “Crush them beneath our boots” quickly changed to fawning songs about how “there never was a coward where the shamrock grows” and endless paeans to Sikh military prowess. </p>
<p>Sure, scratch the paeans even a little bit and you find condescension as strong as ever. But eight hundred years of the British committing genocide against the Irish and considering them literally subhuman turned into smiles and songs about shamrocks once the Irish started looking like useful cannon fodder for a larger fight. And the Sikhs, dark-skinned people with turbans and beards who pretty much exemplify the European stereotype of “scary foreigner”, were lauded by everyone from the news media all the way up <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--OAScn5NcI">to Winston Churchill</a>.</p>
<p>In other words, outgroups may be the people who look exactly like you, and scary foreigner types can become the in-group on a moment’s notice when it seems convenient.</p>
<p><b>III.</b></p>
<p>There are certain theories of dark matter where it barely interacts with the regular world <i>at all</i>, such that we could have a dark matter planet exactly co-incident with Earth and never know. Maybe dark matter people are walking all around us and through us, maybe my house is in the Times Square of a great dark matter city, maybe a few meters away from me a dark matter blogger is writing on his dark matter computer about how weird it would be if there was a light matter person he couldn’t see right next to him.</p>
<p>This is sort of how I feel about conservatives.</p>
<p>I don’t mean the sort of light-matter conservatives who go around complaining about Big Government and occasionally voting for Romney. I see those guys all the time. What I mean is – well, take creationists. According to <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/155003/Hold-Creationist-View-Human-Origins.aspx">Gallup polls</a>, about 46% of Americans are creationists. Not just in the sense of believing God helped guide evolution. I mean they think evolution is a vile atheist lie and God created humans exactly as they exist right now. That’s half the country.</p>
<p>And I don’t have a <i>single one of those people</i> in my social circle. It’s not because I’m deliberately avoiding them; I’m pretty live-and-let-live politically, I wouldn’t ostracize someone just for some weird beliefs. And yet, even though I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number">probably</a> know about a hundred fifty people, I am pretty confident that not one of them is creationist. Odds of this happening by chance? 1/2^150 = 1/10^45 = approximately the chance of picking a particular atom if you are randomly selecting among all the atoms on Earth.</p>
<p>About forty percent of Americans want to ban gay marriage. I think if I <i>really</i> stretch it, maybe ten of my top hundred fifty friends might fall into this group. This is less astronomically unlikely; the odds are a mere one to one hundred quintillion against.</p>
<p>People like to talk about social bubbles, but that doesn’t even begin to cover one hundred quintillion. The only metaphor that seems really appropriate is the bizarre dark matter world.</p>
<p>I live in a Republican congressional district in a state with a Republican governor. The conservatives are definitely out there. They drive on the same roads as I do, live in the same neighborhoods. But they might as well be made of dark matter. I never meet them.</p>
<p>To be fair, I spend a lot of my time inside on my computer. I’m browsing sites like Reddit.</p>
<p>Recently, there was a thread on Reddit asking – <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/29uo38/serious_redditors_against_gay_marriage_what_is/">Redditors Against Gay Marriage, What Is Your Best Supporting Argument?</a> A Reddit user who didn’t understand how anybody could be against gay marriage honestly wanted to know how other people who <i>were</i> against it justified their position. He figured he might as well ask one of the largest sites on the Internet, with an estimated user base in the tens of millions.</p>
<p>It soon became clear that nobody there was actually against gay marriage.</p>
<p>There were a bunch of posts saying “I of course support gay marriage but here are some reasons some other people might be against it,” a bunch of others saying “my argument against gay marriage is the government shouldn’t be involved in the marriage business at all”, and several more saying “why would you even ask this question, there’s no possible good argument and you’re wasting your time”. About halfway through the thread someone started saying homosexuality was unnatural and I <i>thought</i> they were going to be the first one to actually answer the question, but at the end they added “But it’s not my place to decide what is or isn’t natural, I’m still pro-gay marriage.”</p>
<p>In a thread with 10,401 comments, a thread <i>specifically</i> asking for people against gay marriage, I was eventually able to find <i>two</i> people who came out and opposed it, way near the bottom. Their posts started with “I know I’m going to be downvoted to hell for this…”</p>
<p>But I’m not only on Reddit. I also hang out on LW.</p>
<p>On last year’s survey, I found that of American LWers who identify with one of the two major political parties, 80% are Democrat and 20% Republican, which actually sounds pretty balanced compared to some of these other examples.</p>
<p>But it doesn’t last. Pretty much all of those “Republicans” are libertarians who consider the GOP the lesser of two evils. When allowed to choose “libertarian” as an alternative, only 4% of visitors continued to identify as conservative. But that’s still…some. Right?</p>
<p>When I broke the numbers down further, 3 percentage points of those are neoreactionaries, a bizarre sect that wants to be ruled by a king. Only <i>one percent</i> of LWers were normal everyday God-‘n-guns-but-not-George-III conservatives of the type that seem to make up about half of the United States.</p>
<p>It gets worse. My formative years were spent at a university which, if it was similar to other elite universities, had <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A8427-2005Mar28.html">a faculty</a> and <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/11/5/crimson-presidential-poll-2012/">a student body</a> that skewed about 90-10 liberal to conservative – and we can bet that, like LW, even those few token conservatives are Mitt Romney types rather than God-n’-guns types. I get my news from vox.com, an Official Liberal Approved Site. Even when I go out to eat, it turns out my favorite restaurant, California Pizza Kitchen, is <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2014/05/02/liberals-eat-here-conservatives-eat-there/">the most liberal restaurant in the United States</a>.</p>
<p>I inhabit the same geographical area as <i>scores and scores</i> of conservatives. But without meaning to, I have created an <i>outrageously</i> strong bubble, a 10^45 bubble. Conservatives are all around me, yet I am about as likely to have a serious encounter with one as I am a Tibetan lama.</p>
<p>(Less likely, actually. One time a Tibetan lama came to my college and gave a really nice presentation, but if a conservative tried that, people would protest and it would be canceled.)</p>
<p><b>IV.</b></p>
<p>One day I realized that entirely by accident I was fulfilling <i>all</i> the Jewish stereotypes.</p>
<p>I’m nerdy, over-educated, good with words, good with money, weird sense of humor, don’t get outside much, I like deli sandwiches. And I’m a psychiatrist, which is about the most stereotypically Jewish profession short of maybe stand-up comedian or rabbi.</p>
<p>I’m not very religious. And I don’t go to synagogue. But <i>that’s</i> stereotypically Jewish too!</p>
<p>I bring this up because it would be a mistake to think “Well, a Jewish person is by definition someone who is born of a Jewish mother. Or I guess it sort of also means someone who follows the Mosaic Law and goes to synagogue. But I don’t care about Scott’s mother, and I know he doesn’t go to synagogue, so I can’t gain any useful information from knowing Scott is Jewish.”</p>
<p>The defining factors of Judaism – Torah-reading, synagogue-following, mother-having – are the tip of a giant iceberg. Jews sometimes identify as a “tribe”, and even if you don’t attend synagogue, you’re still a member of that tribe and  people can still (in a statistical way) infer things about you by knowing your Jewish identity – like how likely they are to be psychiatrists.</p>
<p>The last section raised a question – if people rarely select their friends and associates and customers explicitly for politics, how do we end up with such intense political segregation?</p>
<p>Well, in the same way “going to synagogue” is merely the iceberg-tip of a Jewish tribe with many distinguishing characteristics, so “voting Republican” or “identifying as conservative” or “believing in creationism” is the iceberg-tip of a conservative tribe with many distinguishing characteristics.</p>
<p>A disproportionate number of my friends are Jewish, because I meet them at psychiatry conferences or something – we self-segregate not based on explicit religion but on implicit tribal characteristics. So in the same way, political tribes self-segregate to an impressive extent – a 1/10^45 extent, I will never tire of hammering in – based on their implicit tribal characteristics.</p>
<p>The people who are actually into this sort of thing sketch out a bunch of speculative tribes and subtribes, but to make it easier, let me stick with two and a half.</p>
<p>The Red Tribe is most classically typified by conservative political beliefs, strong evangelical religious beliefs, creationism, opposing gay marriage, owning guns, eating steak, drinking Coca-Cola, driving SUVs, watching lots of TV, enjoying American football, getting conspicuously upset about terrorists and commies, marrying early, divorcing early, shouting “USA IS NUMBER ONE!!!”, and listening to country music.</p>
<p>The Blue Tribe is most classically typified by liberal political beliefs, vague agnosticism, supporting gay rights, thinking guns are barbaric, eating arugula, drinking fancy bottled water, driving Priuses, reading lots of books, being highly educated, mocking American football, feeling vaguely like they should like soccer but never really being able to get into it, getting conspicuously upset about sexists and bigots, marrying later, constantly pointing out how much more civilized European countries are than America, and listening to “everything except country”.</p>
<p>(There is a partly-formed attempt to spin off a Grey Tribe typified by libertarian political beliefs, Dawkins-style atheism, vague annoyance that the question of gay rights even comes up, eating paleo, drinking Soylent, calling in rides on Uber, reading lots of blogs, calling American football “sportsball”, getting conspicuously upset about the War on Drugs and the NSA, and listening to filk – but for our current purposes this is a distraction and they can safely be considered part of the Blue Tribe most of the time)</p>
<p>I think these “tribes” will turn out to be even stronger categories than politics. Harvard might skew 80-20 in terms of Democrats vs. Republicans, 90-10 in terms of liberals vs. conservatives, but maybe 99-1 in terms of Blues vs. Reds.</p>
<p>It’s the many, many differences between these tribes that explain the strength of the filter bubble – which <i>have I mentioned</i> segregates people at a strength of 1/10^45? Even in something as seemingly politically uncharged as going to California Pizza Kitchen or Sushi House for dinner, I’m restricting myself to the set of people who like cute artisanal pizzas or sophsticated foreign foods, which are classically Blue Tribe characteristics.</p>
<p>Are these tribes based on geography? Are they based on race, ethnic origin, religion, IQ, what TV channels you watched as a kid? I don’t know. </p>
<p>Some of it is certainly genetic – <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/%E2%80%9Dhttp://www.matthewckeller.com/16.Hatemi.et.al.2010.Nuc.fam.ajps.pdf%E2%80%9D">estimates</a> <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/%E2%80%9Dhttps://www.apsanet.org/imgtest/GeneticsAPSR0505.pdf%E2%80%9D">of</a> the genetic contribution to political association range from 0.4 to 0.6. Heritability of one’s attitudes toward gay rights range from 0.3 to 0.5, which hilariously is a little more heritable than homosexuality itself.</p>
<p>(for an interesting attempt to break these down into more rigorous concepts like “traditionalism”, “authoritarianism”, and “in-group favoritism” and find the genetic loading for each <a href="http://www.midus.wisc.edu/findings/pdfs/1287.pdf">see here</a>. For an attempt to trace the specific genes involved, which mostly turn out to be NMDA receptors, <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/%E2%80%9Dhttp://ussc.edu.au/s/media/docs/publications/18_Hatemi_et_al_LinkageGW_JOP.pdf%E2%80%9D">see here</a>)</p>
<p>But I don’t think it’s just genetics. There’s something else going on too. The word “class” seems like the closest analogue, but only if you use it in the sophisticated Paul Fussell <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Class-Through-American-Status-System/dp/0671792253/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=as_li_tl&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=slatestarcode-20&amp;linkId=ae89050500c1fcc0f1d2de1ccb5313ab"><i>Guide Through the American Status System</i></a> way instead of the boring “another word for how much money you make” way.</p>
<p>For now we can just accept them as a brute fact – as multiple coexisting societies that might as well be made of dark matter for all of the interaction they have with one another – and move on.</p>
<p><b>V.</b></p>
<p>The worst reaction I’ve ever gotten to a blog post was when <a href="http://squid314.livejournal.com/294986.html">I wrote about</a> the death of Osama bin Laden. I’ve written all sorts of stuff about race and gender and politics and whatever, but that was the worst.</p>
<p>I didn’t come out and say I was happy he was dead. But some people interpreted it that way, and there followed a bunch of comments and emails and Facebook messages about how could I possibly be happy about the death of another human being, even if he was a bad person? Everyone, even Osama, is a human being, and we should never rejoice in the death of a fellow man. One commenter came out and said:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m surprised at your reaction. As far as people I casually stalk on the internet (ie, LJ and Facebook), you are the first out of the “intelligent, reasoned and thoughtful” group to be uncomplicatedly happy about this development and not to be, say, disgusted at the reactions of the other 90% or so.</p></blockquote>
<p>This commenter was right. Of the “intelligent, reasoned, and thoughtful” people I knew, the overwhelming emotion was conspicuous disgust that other people could be happy about his death. I hastily backtracked and said I wasn’t happy per se, just surprised and relieved that all of this was finally behind us.</p>
<p>And I genuinely believed that day that I had found some unexpected good in people – that everyone I knew was so humane and compassionate that they were unable to rejoice even in the death of someone who hated them and everything they stood for.</p>
<p>Then a few years later, Margaret Thatcher died. And on my Facebook wall – made of these same “intelligent, reasoned, and thoughtful” people – the most common response was to quote some portion of the song “Ding Dong, The Witch Is Dead”. Another popular response was to link the videos of British people spontaneously throwing parties in the street, with comments like “I wish I was there so I could join in”. From this exact same group of people, not a single expression of disgust or a “c’mon, guys, we’re all human beings here.”</p>
<p>I <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/12/if-a-clod-be-washed-away-by-the-sea-europe-is-the-less/">gently pointed this out</a> at the time, and mostly got a bunch of “yeah, so what?”, combined with links to an article claiming that “the demand for respectful silence in the wake of a public figure’s death is not just misguided but dangerous”. </p>
<p>And that was when something clicked for me.</p>
<p>You can talk all you want about Islamophobia, but my friend’s “intelligent, reasoned, and thoughtful people” – her name for the Blue Tribe – can’t get together enough energy to really hate Osama, let alone Muslims in general. We understand that what he did was bad, but it didn’t anger us personally. When he died, we were able to very rationally apply our better nature and our Far Mode beliefs about how it’s never right to be happy about anyone else’s death.</p>
<p>On the other hand, that same group absolutely <i>loathed</i> Thatcher. Most of us (though <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/12/if-a-clod-be-washed-away-by-the-sea-europe-is-the-less/#comment-3355">not all</a>) can agree, if the question is posed explicitly, that Osama was a worse person than Thatcher. But in terms of actual gut feeling? Osama provokes a snap judgment of “flawed human being”, Thatcher a snap judgment of “scum”.</p>
<p>I started this essay by pointing out that, despite what geographical and cultural distance would suggest, the Nazis’ outgroup was not the vastly different Japanese, but the almost-identical German Jews.</p>
<p>And my hypothesis, stated plainly, is that if you’re part of the Blue Tribe, then your outgroup isn’t al-Qaeda, or Muslims, or blacks, or gays, or transpeople, or Jews, or atheists –  it’s the Red Tribe.</p>
<p><b>VI.</b></p>
<p>“But racism and sexism and cissexism and anti-Semitism are these giant all-encompassing social factors that verge upon being human universals! Surely you’re not arguing that mere <i>political</i> differences could ever come close to them!”</p>
<p>One of the ways we <i>know</i> that racism is a giant all-encompassing social factor is the Implicit Association Test. Psychologists ask subjects to quickly identify whether words or photos are members of certain gerrymandered categories, like “either a white person’s face or a positive emotion” or “either a black person’s face and a negative emotion”. Then they compare to a different set of gerrymandered categories, like “either a black person’s face or a positive emotion” or “either a white person’s face or a negative emotion.” If subjects have more trouble (as measured in latency time) connecting white people to negative things than they do white people to positive things, then they probably have subconscious positive associations with white people. You can <a href="https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/">try it yourself here</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, what the test famously found was that even white people who claimed to have no racist attitudes at all usually had positive associations with white people and negative associations with black people on the test. There are very many claims and counterclaims about the precise meaning of this, but it ended up being a big part of the evidence in favor of the current consensus that all white people are at least a little racist.</p>
<p>Anyway, three months ago, someone finally had the bright idea of <a href="http://pcl.stanford.edu/research/2014/iyengar-ajps-group-polarization.pdf">doing an Implicit Association Test with political parties</a>, and they found that people’s unconscious partisan biases were <i>half again as strong</i> as their unconscious racial biases (h/t <a href="http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-09-22/partyism-now-trumps-racism">Bloomberg</a>. For example, if you are a white Democrat, your unconscious bias against blacks (as measured by something called a d-score) is 0.16, but your unconscious bias against Republicans will be 0.23. The Cohen’s <i>d</i> for racial bias was 0.61, by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size#.22Small.22.2C_.22medium.22.2C_.22large.22_effect_sizes">the book</a> a “moderate” effect size; for party it was 0.95, a “large” effect size.</p>
<p>Okay, fine, but we know race has <i>real world</i> consequences. Like, there have been <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/20/social-justice-for-the-highly-demanding-of-rigor/">several studies</a> where people sent out a bunch of identical resumes except sometimes with a black person’s photo and other times with a white person’s photo, and it was noticed that employers were much more likely to invite the fictional white candidates for interviews. So just some stupid Implicit Association Test results can’t compare to that, right?</p>
<p>Iyengar and Westwood also decided to do the resume test for parties. They asked subjects to decide which of several candidates should get a scholarship (subjects were told this was a genuine decision for the university the researchers were affiliated with). Some resumes had photos of black people, others of white people. And some students listed their experience in Young Democrats of America, others in Young Republicans of America.</p>
<p>Once again, discrimination on the basis of party was much stronger than discrimination on the basis of race. The size of the race effect for white people was only 56-44 (and in the reverse of the expected direction); the size of the party effect was about 80-20 for Democrats and 69-31 for Republicans.</p>
<p>If you want to see their third experiment, which applied <i>yet another</i> classic methodology used to detect racism and <i>once again</i> found partyism to be much stronger, you can read the paper.</p>
<p>I &amp; W did an unusually thorough job, but this sort of thing isn’t new or ground-breaking. People have been studying “belief congruence theory” – the idea that differences in beliefs are more important than demographic factors in forming in-groups and outgroups – for decades. As early as 1967, Smith et al were doing surveys all over the country and <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;uid=2005-11098-001">finding that</a> people were more likely to accept friendships across racial lines than across beliefs; in the forty years since then, the observation has been replicated scores of times. Insko, Moe, and Nacoste’s 2006 review <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejsp.2420130206/abstract">Belief Congruence And Racial Discrimination</a> concludes that:</p>
<blockquote><p>. The literature was judged supportive of a weak version of belief congruence theory which states that in those contexts in which social pressure is nonexistent or ineffective, belief is more important than race as a determinant of racial or ethnic discrimination. Evidence for a strong version of belief congruence theory (which states that in those contexts in which social pressure is nonexistent, or ineffective, belief is the only determinant of racial or ethnic discrimination) and was judged much more problematic.</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the best-known examples of racism is the “Guess Who’s Coming To Dinner” scenario where parents are scandalized about their child marrying someone of a different race. Pew has done <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2014/06/12/section-3-political-polarization-and-personal-life/">some good work on this</a> and found that only 23% of conservatives and 1% (!) of liberals admit they would be upset in this situation. But Pew <i>also</i> asked how parents would feel about their child marrying someone of a different <i>political party</i>. Now 30% of conservatives and 23% of liberals would get upset. Average them out, and you go from 12% upsetness rate for race to 27% upsetness rate for party – more than double. Yeah, people do lie to pollsters, but a picture is starting to come together here. </p>
<p>(Harvard, by the way, is a tossup. There are more black students – 11.5% – than conservative students – 10% – but there are more conservative faculty than black faculty.)</p>
<p>Since people will delight in misinterpreting me here, let me overemphasize what I am <i>not</i> saying. I’m not saying people of either party have it “worse” than black people, or that partyism is more of a <i>problem</i> than racism, or any of a number of stupid things along those lines which I am sure I will nevertheless be accused of believing. Racism is worse than partyism because the two parties are at least kind of balanced in numbers and in resources, whereas the brunt of an entire country’s racism falls on a few underprivileged people. I am saying that the <i>underlying attitudes that produce</i> partyism are stronger than the underlying attitudes that produce racism, with no necessary implications on their social effects. </p>
<p>But if we want to look at people’s psychology and motivations, partyism and the particular variant of tribalism that it represents are going to be fertile ground.</p>

<p>Every election cycle like clockwork, conservatives accuse liberals of not being sufficiently pro-America. And every election cycle like clockwork, liberals give extremely unconvincing denials of this.</p>
<p>“It’s not that we’re, like, <i>against</i> America per se. It’s just that…well, did you know Europe has much better health care than we do? And much lower crime rates? I mean, come on, how did they get so awesome? And we’re just sitting here, can’t even get the gay marriage thing sorted out, seriously, what’s wrong with a country that can’t…sorry, what were we talking about? Oh yeah, America. They’re okay. Cesar Chavez was really neat. So were some other people outside the mainstream who became famous precisely by criticizing majority society. That’s <i>sort of</i> like America being great, in that I think the parts of it that point out how bad the rest of it are often make excellent points. Vote for me!”</p>
<p>(sorry, I make fun of you because I love you)</p>
<p>There was a big brouhaha a couple of years ago when, as it first became apparent Obama had a good shot at the Presidency, Michelle Obama <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2008/02/michelle-obam-1-2">said that</a> “for the first time in my adult life, I am proud of my country.”</p>
<p>Republicans pounced on the comment, asking why she hadn’t felt proud before, and she backtracked saying of course she was proud all the time and she loves America with the burning fury of a million suns and she was just saying that the Obama campaign was <i>particularly</i> inspiring. </p>
<p>As unconvincing denials go, this one was pretty far up there. But no one really held it against her. Probably most Obama voters felt vaguely the same way. <i>I</i> was an Obama voter, and I have proud memories of spending my Fourth of Julys as a kid debunking people’s heartfelt emotions of patriotism. Aaron Sorkin:</p>
<blockquote><p>[What makes America the greatest country in the world?] It’s not the greatest country in the world! We’re seventh in literacy, 27th in math, 22nd in science, 49th in life expectancy, 178th in infant mortality, third in median household income, No. 4 in labor force, and No. 4 in exports. So when you ask what makes us the greatest country in the world, I don’t know what the f*** you’re talking about.</p></blockquote>
<p>(Another <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/07/03/21-maps-and-charts-that-prove-america-is-number-one/">good retort</a> is “We’re number one? Sure – number one in incarceration rates, drone strikes, and making new parents go back to work!”)</p>
<p>All of this is true, of course. But it’s weird that it’s such a classic interest of members of the Blue Tribe, and members of the Red Tribe never seem to bring it up.</p>
<p>(“We’re number one? Sure – number one in levels of sexual degeneracy! Well, I guess probably number two, after the Netherlands, but they’re really small and shouldn’t count.”)</p>
<p>My hunch – both the Red Tribe and the Blue Tribe, for whatever reason, identify “America” with the Red Tribe. Ask people for typically “American” things, and you end up with a very Red list of characteristics – guns, religion, barbecues, American football, NASCAR, cowboys, SUVs, unrestrained capitalism.</p>
<p>That means the Red Tribe feels intensely patriotic about “their” country, and the Blue Tribe feels like they’re living in fortified enclaves deep in hostile territory. </p>
<p>Here is a popular piece published on a major media site called <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/justin-stoneman/post_868_b_720398.html">America: A Big, Fat, Stupid Nation</a>. Another: <a href="http://english.pravda.ru/opinion/columnists/03-07-2008/105678-america-0/">America: A Bunch Of Spoiled, Whiny Brats</a>. Americans <a href="http://matadornetwork.com/life/10-embarrassing-american-stereotypes/">are</a> ignorant, scientifically illiterate religious fanatics whose “patriotism” is actually just narcissism. <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/11/06/you_will_be_shocked_at_how_ignorant_americans_are_partner/">You Will Be Shocked At How Ignorant Americans Are</a>, and we should <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/the_big_idea/2010/02/down_with_the_people.html">Blame The Childish, Ignorant American People</a>.</p>
<p>Needless to say, every single one of these articles was written by an American and read almost entirely by Americans. Those Americans very likely enjoyed the articles very much and did not feel the least bit insulted.</p>
<p>And look at the sources. HuffPo, Salon, Slate. Might those have anything in common?</p>
<p>On both sides, “American” can be either a normal demonym, or a code word for a member of the Red Tribe.</p>

<p>The other day, I logged into OKCupid and found someone who looked cool. I was reading over her profile and found the following sentence:</p>
<blockquote><p>Don’t message me if you’re a sexist white guy</p></blockquote>
<p>And my first thought was “Wait, so a sexist black person would be okay? Why?”</p>
<p>(The girl in question was white as snow)</p>
<p>Around the time the Ferguson riots were first starting, there were a host of articles with titles like <a href="http://mic.com/articles/96554/why-white-people-don-t-seem-to-understand-ferguson-in-one-chart">Why White People Don’t Seem To Understand Ferguson</a>, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/08/self-segregation-why-its-hard-for-whites-to-understand-ferguson/378928/">Why It’s So Hard For Whites To Understand Ferguson</a>, and <a href="http://blog.chron.com/texassparkle/2014/08/white-folks-listen-up-and-let-me-tell-you-what-ferguson-is-all-about/">White Folks Listen Up And Let Me Tell You What Ferguson Is All About</a>, this last of which says: </p>
<blockquote><p>Social media is full of people on both sides making presumptions, and believing what they want to believe. But it’s the white folks that don’t understand what this is all about. Let me put it as simply as I can for you […]</p>
<p>No matter how wrong you think Trayvon Martin or Michael Brown were, I think we can all agree they didn’t deserve to die over it. I want you white folks to understand that this is where the anger is coming from. You focused on the looting….”</p></blockquote>
<p>And on a hunch I checked the author photos, and every single one of these articles was written by a white person. </p>

<p>We’ve all seen articles and comments and articles like this. Some unsavory people try to use them to prove that white people are the <i>real</i> victims or the media is biased against white people or something. Other people who are very nice and optimistic use them to show that some white people have developed some self-awareness and are willing to engage in self-criticism.</p>
<p>But I think the situation with “white” is much the same as the situation with “American” – it can either mean what it says, or be a code word for the Red Tribe.</p>
<p>(except on the blog <a href="http://stuffwhitepeoplelike.com/">Stuff White People Like</a>, where it obviously serves as a code word for the <i>Blue</i> tribe. I don’t know, guys. I didn’t do it.)</p>
<p>I realize that’s making a strong claim, but it would hardly be without precedent. When people say things like “gamers are misogynist”, do they mean <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/18/52-percent-people-playing-games-women-industry-doesnt-know">the 52% of gamers who are women</a>? Do they mean every one of the 59% of Americans from every walk of life who are known to play video or computer games occasionally? No. “Gamer” is a coded reference to the Gray Tribe, the half-branched-off collection of libertarianish tech-savvy nerds, and everyone knows it. As well expect that when people talk about “fedoras”, they mean Indiana Jones. Or when they talk about “urban youth”, they mean freshmen at NYU. Everyone knows exactly who we mean when we say “urban youth”, and them being young people who live in a city has only the most tenuous of relations to the actual concept.</p>
<p>And I’m saying words like “American” and “white” work the same way. Bill Clinton was the <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2014/04/03/bill_clinton_i_loved_being_called_the_first_black_president.html">“first black President”</a>, but if Herman Cain had won in 2012 he’d have been the 43rd white president. And when an angry white person talks at great length about how much he hates “white dudes”, <i>he is not being humble and self-critical</i>.</p>
<p><b>IX.</b></p>
<p>Imagine hearing that a liberal talk show host and comedian was so enraged by the actions of ISIS that he’d recorded and posted a video in which he shouts at them for ten minutes, cursing the “fanatical terrorists” and calling them “utter savages” with “savage values”.</p>
<p>If <i>I</i> heard that, I’d be kind of surprised. It doesn’t fit my model of what liberal talk show hosts do.</p>
<p>But <a href="http://rt.com/usa/168704-russell-brand-fox-news/">the story</a> I’m <i>actually</i> referring to is liberal talk show host / comedian Russell Brand making that same rant against Fox News for <i>supporting war against</i> the Islamic State, adding at the end that “Fox is worse than ISIS”.</p>
<p>That fits my model perfectly. You wouldn’t celebrate Osama’s death, only Thatcher’s. And you wouldn’t call ISIS savages, only Fox News. Fox is the outgroup, ISIS is just some random people off in a desert. You hate the outgroup, you don’t hate random desert people.</p>
<p>I would go further. Not only does Brand not feel much like hating ISIS, he has a strong incentive not to. That incentive is: the Red Tribe is known to hate ISIS loudly and conspicuously. Hating ISIS would signal Red Tribe membership, would be the equivalent of going into Crips territory with a big Bloods gang sign tattooed on your shoulder.</p>
<p>But this might be unfair. What would Russell Brand answer, if we asked him to justify his decision to be much angrier at Fox than ISIS?</p>
<p>He might say something like “Obviously Fox News is not literally worse than ISIS. But here I am, talking to my audience, who are mostly white British people and Americans. These people already know that ISIS is bad; they don’t need to be told that any further. In fact, at this point being angry about how bad ISIS is, is less likely to genuinely change someone’s mind about ISIS, and more likely to promote Islamophobia. The sort of people in my audience are at zero risk of becoming ISIS supporters, but at a very real risk of Islamophobia. So ranting against ISIS would be counterproductive and dangerous. </p>
<p>On the other hand, my audience of white British people and Americans is very likely to contain many Fox News viewers and supporters. And Fox, while not quite as evil as ISIS, is still pretty bad. So here’s somewhere I have a genuine chance to reach people at risk and change minds. Therefore, I think my decision to rant against Fox News, and maybe hyperbolically say they were ‘worse than ISIS’ is justified under the circumstances.”</p>
<p>I have a lot of sympathy to hypothetical-Brand, especially to the part about Islamophobia. It <i>does</i> seem really possible to denounce ISIS’ atrocities to a population that already hates them in order to <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/%E2%80%9Dhttps://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/12/weak-men-are-superweapons/%E2%80%9D">weak-man</a> a couple of already-marginalized Muslims. We need to fight terrorism and atrocities – therefore it’s okay to shout at a poor girl ten thousand miles from home for wearing a headscarf in public. Christians are being executed for their faith in Sudan, therefore let’s picket the people trying to build a mosque next door.</p>
<p>But my sympathy with Brand ends when he acts like his audience is likely to be fans of Fox News.</p>
<p>In a world where a negligible number of Redditors oppose gay marriage and 1% of Less Wrongers identify conservative and I know 0/150 creationists, how many of the people who visit the YouTube channel of a well-known liberal activist with a Che-inspired banner, a channel whose episode names are things like “War: What Is It Good For?” and “Sarah Silverman Talks Feminism” – how many of them do you think are big Fox News fans?</p>
<p>In a way, Russell Brand would have been <i>braver</i> taking a stand against ISIS than against Fox. If he attacked ISIS, his viewers would just be a little confused and uncomfortable. Whereas every moment he’s attacking Fox his viewers are like “HA HA! YEAH! GET ‘EM! SHOW THOSE IGNORANT BIGOTS IN THE OUTGROUP WHO’S BOSS!”</p>
<p>Brand acts as if there are just these countries called “Britain” and “America” who are receiving his material. Wrong. There are two parallel universes, and he’s only broadcasting to one of them.</p>
<p>The result is exactly what we predicted would happen in the case of Islam. Bombard people with images of a far-off land they already hate and tell them to hate it more, and the result is ramping up the intolerance on the couple of dazed and marginalized representatives of that culture who have ended up stuck on your half of the divide. Sure enough, if industry or culture or community gets Blue enough, Red Tribe members start getting harassed, fired from their jobs (Brendan Eich being the obvious example) or otherwise shown the door.</p>
<p>Think of Brendan Eich as a member of a tiny religious minority surrounded by people who hate that minority. Suddenly firing him doesn’t seem very noble.</p>
<p>If you mix together Podunk, Texas and Mosul, Iraq, you can prove that Muslims are scary and very powerful people who are executing Christians all the time – and so we have a great excuse for kicking the one remaining Muslim family, random people who never hurt anyone, out of town. </p>
<p>And if you mix together the open-source tech industry and the parallel universe <a href="http://rmitz.org/freebsd.daemon.html">where</a> you can’t wear a FreeBSD t-shirt without risking someone trying to exorcise you, you can prove that Christians are scary and very powerful people who are persecuting everyone else all the time, and you have a great excuse for kicking one of the few people willing to affiliate with the Red Tribe, a guy who never hurt anyone, out of town.</p>
<p>When a friend of mine heard Eich got fired, she didn’t see anything wrong with it. “I can tolerate anything except intolerance,” she said.</p>
<p>“Intolerance” is starting to look like another one of those words like “white” and “American”.</p>
<p>“I can tolerate anything except the outgroup.” Doesn’t sound quite so noble now, does it?</p>
<p><b>X.</b></p>
<p>We started by asking: millions of people are conspicuously praising every outgroup they can think of, while conspicuously condemning their own in-group. This seems contrary to what we know about social psychology. What’s up?</p>
<p>We noted that outgroups are rarely literally “the group most different from you”, and in fact far more likely to be groups very similar to you sharing <i>almost</i> all your characteristics and living in the same area.</p>
<p>We then noted that although liberals and conservatives live in the same area, they might as well be two totally different countries or universe as far as level of interaction were concerned. </p>
<p>Contra the usual idea of them being marked only by voting behavior, we described them as very different tribes with totally different cultures. You can speak of “American culture” only in the same way you can speak of “Asian culture” – that is, with a lot of interior boundaries being pushed under the rug.</p>
<p>The outgroup of the Red Tribe is occasionally blacks and gays and Muslims, more often the Blue Tribe.</p>
<p>The Blue Tribe has performed some kind of very impressive act of alchemy, and transmuted <i>all</i> of its outgroup hatred to the Red Tribe.</p>
<p>This is not surprising. Ethnic differences have proven quite tractable in the face of shared strategic aims. Even the Nazis, not known for their ethnic tolerance, were able to get all buddy-buddy with the Japanese when they had a common cause.</p>
<p>Research suggests Blue Tribe / Red Tribe prejudice to be much stronger than better-known types of prejudice like racism. Once the Blue Tribe was able to enlist the blacks and gays and Muslims in their ranks, they became allies of convenience who deserve to be rehabilitated with mildly condescending paeans to their virtue. “There never was a coward where the shamrock grows.”</p>
<p>Spending your entire life insulting the other tribe and talking about how terrible they are makes you look, well, tribalistic. It is definitely not high class. So when members of the Blue Tribe decide to dedicate their entire life to yelling about how terrible the Red Tribe is, they make sure that instead of saying “the Red Tribe”, they say “America”, or “white people”, or “straight white men”. That way it’s <i>humble self-criticism</i>. They are <i>so</i> interested in justice that they are willing to critique <i>their own beloved side</i>, much as it pains them to do so. We know they are not exaggerating, because one might exaggerate the flaws of an enemy, but that anyone would exaggerate their <i>own</i> flaws fails <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criterion_of_embarrassment">the criterion of embarrassment</a>.</p>
<p>The Blue Tribe always has an excuse at hand to persecute and crush any Red Tribers unfortunate enough to fall into its light-matter-universe by defining them as all-powerful domineering oppressors. They appeal to the fact that this is definitely the way it works in the Red Tribe’s dark-matter-universe, and that’s in the same country so it has to be the same community for all intents and purposes. As a result, every Blue Tribe institution is permanently licensed to take whatever emergency measures are necessary against the Red Tribe, however disturbing they might otherwise seem.</p>
<p>And so how virtuous, how noble the Blue Tribe! Perfectly tolerant of all of the different groups that just so happen to be allied with them, never intolerant unless it happen to be against intolerance itself. Never stooping to engage in petty tribal conflict like that awful Red Tribe, but always nobly criticizing their own culture and striving to make it better!</p>
<p>Sorry. But I hope this is at least a <i>little</i> convincing. The weird dynamic of outgroup-philia and ingroup-phobia isn’t anything of the sort. It’s just good old-fashioned in-group-favoritism and outgroup bashing, a little more sophisticated and a little more sneaky.</p>
<p><b>XI.</b></p>
<p>This essay is bad and I should feel bad.</p>
<p>I should feel bad because I made <i>exactly</i> the mistake I am trying to warn everyone else about, and it wasn’t until I was almost done that I noticed.</p>
<p>How virtuous, how noble I must be! Never stooping to engage in petty tribal conflict like that silly Red Tribe, but always nobly criticizing my own tribe and striving to make it better.</p>
<p>Yeah. Once I’ve written a ten thousand word essay savagely attacking the Blue Tribe, either I’m a very special person or they’re my outgroup. And I’m not <i>that</i> special.</p>
<p>Just as you can pull a fast one and look humbly self-critical if you make your audience assume there’s just one American culture, so maybe you can trick people by assuming there’s only one Blue Tribe.</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure I’m not Red, but I did talk about the Grey Tribe above, and I show all the risk factors for being one of them. That means that, although my critique of the Blue Tribe may be right or wrong, in terms of <i>motivation</i> it comes from the same place as a Red Tribe member talking about how much they hate al-Qaeda or a Blue Tribe member talking about how much they hate ignorant bigots. And when I boast of being able to tolerate Christians and Southerners whom the Blue Tribe is mean to, I’m not being tolerant at all, just noticing people so far away from me they wouldn’t make a good outgroup anyway. </p>
<p>I had <i>fun</i> writing this article. People do not have fun writing articles savagely criticizing their in-group. People can criticize their in-group, it’s not <i>humanly impossible</i>, but it takes nerves of steel, it makes your blood boil, you should sweat blood. It shouldn’t be <i>fun</i>.</p>
<p>You can bet some white guy on Gawker who week after week churns out “Why White People Are So Terrible” and “Here’s What Dumb White People Don’t Understand” is having fun and not sweating any blood at all. He’s not criticizing his in-group, he’s never even <i>considered</i> criticizing his in-group. I can’t blame him. Criticizing the in-group is a really difficult project I’ve barely begun to build the mental skills necessary to even consider.</p>
<p>I can think of criticisms of my own tribe. Important criticisms, true ones. But the thought of writing them makes my blood boil.</p>
<p>I imagine might I feel like some liberal US Muslim leader, when he goes on the O’Reilly Show, and O’Reilly ambushes him and demands to know why he and other American Muslims haven’t condemned beheadings by ISIS more, demands that he criticize them right there on live TV. And you can see the wheels in the Muslim leader’s head turning, thinking something like “Okay, obviously beheadings are terrible and I hate them as much as anyone. But you don’t care even <i>the slightest bit</i> about the victims of beheadings. You’re just looking for a way to score points against me so you can embarass all Muslims. And I would rather personally behead every single person in the world than give a smug bigot like you a single microgram more stupid self-satisfaction than you’ve already got.”</p>
<p>That is how I feel when asked to criticize my own tribe, even for correct reasons. If you think you’re criticizing your own tribe, and your blood is not at that temperature, consider the possibility that you aren’t.</p>
<p>But if I want Self-Criticism Virtue Points, criticizing the Grey Tribe is the only honest way to get them. And if I want Tolerance Points, my own personal cross to bear right now is tolerating the Blue Tribe.  I need to remind myself that when they are bad people, they are merely Osama-level bad people instead of Thatcher-level bad people. And when they are good people, they are powerful and necessary crusaders against the evils of the world.</p>
<p>The worst thing that could happen to this post is to have it be used as convenient feces to fling at the Blue Tribe whenever feces are necessary. Which, given what has happened to my last couple of posts along these lines and the obvious biases of my own subconscious, I already expect it will be.</p>
<p>But the best thing that could happen to this post is that it makes a lot of people, especially myself, figure out how to be more tolerant. Not in the “of course I’m tolerant, why shouldn’t I be?” sense of the Emperor in Part I. But in the sense of “being tolerant makes me see red, makes me sweat blood, but darn it <i>I am going to be tolerant anyway</i>.”</p>
