<p>I just wrapped up a tech conference here this week in Salt Lake City. I was one of the speakers. It was a special moment for me. Strangely enough, the very first time I came to US, it was also as a speaker at a conference.</p>
<p><em>“Did you just say you are a speaker at this thing?”</em>, asked the US Visa officer, before stamping a B1/B2 on my Passport for ten years.</p>
<p>I was 18 back then. The confusion made sense.</p>
<p>A decade has gone by. I got married, switched multiple jobs, wrote a lot of code, lived in three different continents, spoke at many conferences and made a lot of friends for life. I am now back living in India.</p>
<p><em>“Dude, so when are you moving to the US?”,</em> I frequently get asked by friends, colleagues and my well-wishers.</p>
<p><em>“I’m not”.</em></p>
<p>My answer falls flat on most people. It’s as if, I’ve just said, <em>“I do not want more money and success.”</em></p>
<p>In this blog post I want to add more colors to my answer. Hope some of you relate with this, especially if you are someone like me considering your decision of moving abroad or moving back.</p>
<p>But first, let me take you back to my teens when life was much simpler and Physics was my most favorite thing in life.</p>
<h2 id="the-iit-dream"><a href="#the-iit-dream" aria-label="the iit dream permalink"></a>The IIT Dream</h2>
<p>Just like many Indians of my generation, I spent my childhood in a single bedroom rented house. Every evening, my brother and I would sit in front of an oil lamp and study, mostly maths and science. In the mornings, our <em>dada ji</em> would teach us English and Hindi grammar. It was a household where two things were most valued - Education and Love.</p>
<p>Education, because that seemed like the only way to escape generational poverty and not having to worry about, if there are enough candlesticks to last the week or not.</p>
<p>And, Love because <em>familia is everything</em>.</p>
<p>Millions of students in India prepare to get into IITs every year. With the proper amount of luck and improper amount of childhood sacrifices, I made it into IIT Kharagpur. And that changed everything.</p>
<p>During the admission to engineering colleges, more than two thirds of students want to study Computer Science. This is want increases the chances of landing a job and what everyone seems to be doing. In my hostel room in Kota where I studied for 2 years of IIT prep, I had a note stuck on my wall which listed all the opening and closing ranks of all Computer Science branches in the 7 major IITs. When I saw the results and my rank, it was nowhere close to those CS cutoff ranks and I teared up as if I had failed.</p>
<p>And just like that, 99.99% of Indian students start their education journey by the system telling them that they are not worth it and they don’t even get to decide what they study.</p>
<p>While I couldn’t get into the Computer Science department, I knew what I wanted to study. My father has been a software engineer since the 90s and my brother is an absolute rockstar with computers. We didn’t have cartoons in TV back in our childhood but had our hands on keyboard ever since I could possibly remember.</p>
<p>So, I was ready to join IIT and say <em>“Fuck you,”</em> to the education system, “<em>I’m going to be the best programmer the world has ever seen.”</em></p>
<h2 id="college-and-open-source"><a href="#college-and-open-source" aria-label="college and open source permalink"></a>College and Open Source</h2>
<p>I was nowhere close to being the best programmer. I failed to implement a linked list in C in my first year. It was not going well. However, at the same time, I created my first Python package <a href="https://github.com/morse-talk/morse-talk">morse-talk</a> and published on pypi.org. It was immediately used by a professor somewhere in Europe who forked it and made a lot of contributions.</p>
<p>My goal of being the “best programmer” shifted to "create value for others by writing code". That summer, only 4 students were selected in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code">Google Summer of Code</a> from my college. I was one of them, the only freshman. Two years of GSoC paid more than enough to cover my five years of college tuition fees. I found both value and meaning by doing Open Source.</p>
<p>Very quickly, people started referring me with my <a href="https://github.com/orkohunter">GitHub handle</a> OrkoHunter. I, among few of my good friends, established <a href="https://kossiitkgp.org/">Kharagpur Open Source Society</a> to spread the culture of Open Source in campus. Though secretly, it was to give hope to the students who were defeated by the education system and told <em>“You can’t study Computer Science, because you didn’t know Carbon has a radioactive isotope.”</em> In the first few years, we exclusively hired only non-CS students out of spite.</p>
<h2 id="twitter--san-francisco"><a href="#twitter--san-francisco" aria-label="twitter  san francisco permalink"></a>Twitter @ San Francisco</h2>
<p>I was having a blast with the altruism that came with organizing Open Source workshops for students, helping them write their first useful Python application and making their first Pull Request. In 2017, we organized our first ever Open Source conference in college. We had about a thousand attendees, two days of talks, tutorials and lots of fun. We had full flown AV setup, speakers and attendees coming from multiple cities. We had a large budget too. I was leading it, being one of the three co-chairs of the conference. We were living the dream!</p>
<p>One night during the summit, I received an email from a recruiter at Twitter - <em>“Hey Himanshu, We saw your GitHub profile. Would you like to join us for an internship at Twitter San Francisco office in the Open Source team?”</em>. I was so busy with the conference that I forgot to respond for 24 hours. She reached back - <em>“Himanshu, are you interested?”</em></p>
<p>Landing a foreign internship in college is one of those 0.1% things - it’s extremely rare. You need to practice a lot of leetcode, have excellent referrals and be a sports programmer ready to traverse a binary tree. I have never written a Binary Tree traversal in life.</p>
<p>My interviews were all around the projects I had open sourced by then. One being the most popular Python library for Graph Theory, the other being a package used to study X-ray data from black holes. I was working on much more important things. Learning how to traverse a Binary Tree for me was a waste of time - that’s how I saw it back then. I knew I will most likely never use it. Though I used to be maniacal about writing reusable code and ReactJS!</p>
<p>I applied for the J1 visa (short term work visa) and made my way to San Francisco. That summer in SF was probably the coldest summer I had ever. The internship paid extremely well and taught a lot of things about corporate Open Source. I worked upon setting up the <a href="https://opensource.twitter.dev/">opensource.twitter.dev</a> - something which still runs and publishes weekly reports of Twitter’s flagship open source projects. I’m pretty sure Elon Musk has seen the website.</p>
<p>Career-wise, it was the best thing that could have happened to me. My manager from Twitter moved to Spotify later on who told me about the Backstage Open Source project, which led me to Harness leading the product built on top of Backstage. As Steve Jobs once said, <em>“you will only be able to connect the dots looking backwards.”</em></p>
<h2 id="the-emotional-turmoil-in-san-francisco"><a href="#the-emotional-turmoil-in-san-francisco" aria-label="the emotional turmoil in san francisco permalink"></a>The Emotional Turmoil in San Francisco</h2>
<p>Despite the thrilling career advancements that summer, I often wept myself to sleep at nights. The timezone difference between India and US west coast is about 12 hours. Which means, when you wake up, your family and friends are about to go to bed. And when you come back from office, your family has just woken up. Couple of hours is all you get to connect with anyone back home.</p>
<p>Okay, here’s the thing, I had lived alone before. For the IIT prep, I was in Kota for 2 years locked in my room and studying, visited home only two times during Diwalis. My college was in a remote village and far from home as well. But I had never felt that lonely, being on the other side of the world than home.</p>
<p>I am also not an introvert when it comes to talking to strangers. I was leading two student groups in college and fortunately made a lot of friends. It was easy for me to approach seniors, batch mates and juniors in college to build relationships. However, making friends in US was a completely different ballgame.</p>
<p>Money and Status was on everyone’s mind. All they talked about was Visas, dating, getting paid more and playing a different kind of game that I wanted to play. Not many <em>truly</em> wanted to be a software engineer or cared about Software. While I found few who did and made a real attempt to know each other - the friendships I found in the US were very shallow. Back home, we called them acquaintances.</p>
<p>It all felt … like an unlivable place for commoners like me. Homelessness was at its peak. I am the guy, who likes to walk slow on the streets without a destination. But I was told on day one Twitter orientation to <em>“Walk fast”</em>. Drugged homeless people approached me, one guy tried to hit me while waiting to cross the street. I once went out to get some groceries and when making a turn, I saw a person holding a gun, hiding at the turn, waiting for someone. I had never seen a gun in my life till that point. It made me think - <em>“If I’m caught accidentally in a gun fight here, no amount of legal justice or candle marches would make my parents happy”.</em></p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, I have a huge respect for San Francisco and the Bay Area. For me, it still is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Being an engineer as well as follower of Ram Dass and Timothy Leary, I thank the west for what it has given to world. One of the first Open Source license BSD, came from Berkley. The computer I am using to write this on, came from the valley. Silicon Valley is an absolutely historic place for a techie like me. I actually felt quiet emotional walking on the Haight-Ashbury street. The words “Turn On, Tune In and Drop out” echoed in my ears.</p>
<p>Despite the respect for the place and culture, I found myself struggling to become one with it. After spending 4 months there, I still had one year of college left. On my final day in US, I ate my last bagel sandwich in a cafe in Mission district and boarded my flight back to Kolkata. After 24 hours of flight and three hours of cab drive, I reached my hostel. One of my dear friends was waiting for me downstairs at 2AM. We hugged and I knew, I had arrived <em>home</em>.</p>
<h2 id="college-placements-and-first-job"><a href="#college-placements-and-first-job" aria-label="college placements and first job permalink"></a>College placements and first job</h2>
<p>Being an Indian student, it is almost impossible to get your first job in the US. Very rarely companies take the chance of picking you to go through H1B lottery, employers go for a safer choice. My manager at Twitter tried to get me a job, but after months of struggle, he gave up, and I had no job offer.</p>
<p>All IITs and most colleges have a “placement season” where companies fly in on campus and hire as many students as they can within a short period of time. It’s a flea market. Thousands of students show up in collared white shirts, blue pants and polished black shoes with resumes in their hands. Day 1 placement makes you a rockstar among your friends. If you are not placed by Day 10, you are essentially a loser.</p>
<p>Students get no choice of where they want to work at. If you pass their series of coding tests, panel discussions and what not - you are given one offer (if you are blessed then maybe 2-3 offers) and have to make the decision in an hour. No negotiation on what you will be doing, at what location or at what compensation.</p>
<p>The rebel in me found the system to be dehumanizing, especially for the Top 1% students of the country. As a result, I told myself that I will find a job elsewhere where I will have some idea on what I’ll be working upon and with whom. I did not sign up for campus placements.</p>
<p>A friend of mine connected me with an employer in Tokyo. The product was Mercari US and the team was pretty diverse. It paid well and many of my friends were already going to Tokyo that year. I interviewed with the CTO, VP of Product and Engineering and my Engineering Manager, and I was in! Again, without traversing a binary tree. The job paid extremely well for a new grad like me. I was set to join them after I graduate. As they say, <em>when it rains, it pours</em>.</p>
<h2 id="life-in-tokyo"><a href="#life-in-tokyo" aria-label="life in tokyo permalink"></a>Life in Tokyo</h2>
<p>I was very excited to go to Japan. I found the country to be extremely calm and connected with the roots of human consciousness. It was people, people were hardworking but respectful of each other. Great customer service, free of crime and welcoming. Everyone was somehow aware. Everyone respected elderly and valued wisdom.</p>
<p>Japan and India only has a timezone difference of about 4 hours. There was plenty of time in the day for me to connect back to family and friends. I made friends there as well, actually a lot of them. I was sharing my apartment with a very good friend of mine from college. Life was amazing!</p>
<p>Work was great too. I distinctly remember my manager saying - <em>“You don’t seem like a fresher”</em>. All because I have been writing real code for 5 years at that point and not traversing binary trees. I knew what a 12 factor app was and how to write effective Database queries that scales up to tens of thousands of daily active users.</p>
<p>One fine day, I was talking to my ex-manager back from Twitter, who had just moved to Spotify. He told me about <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage">Backstage Open Source</a>. It was released just a few days ago, on March 14, 2020. I have always dreamt about writing Open Source software while getting paid for it. He said, <em>“Himanshu, just so you know, I would love to work with you again in a heartbeat, if I could.”</em></p>
<p>Over the weekend, I got two pull requests merged in the project. It had 50 GitHub stars back then and a few contributors. It is currently at about 30K stars with 1500+ contributors. Interviews happened with Spotify and I knew every single one of my interviewers. In one of those, we forgot to introduce ourselves as we have been talking back and forth on Discord on the same day. I made my way in. Spotify flew me Premium Economy to Stockholm, the land of Opeth and Zlatan Ibrahimovic. That’s all I knew about Sweden.</p>
<h2 id="life-in-stockholm-and-covid"><a href="#life-in-stockholm-and-covid" aria-label="life in stockholm and covid permalink"></a>Life in Stockholm and Covid</h2>
<p>My first summer in Stockholm was my best summer ever. The bar was already high by that point, but I absolutely enjoyed biking every weekend to play football, walking around the rivers, parks and nearby jungles. Stockholm is an interesting landscape, within 5 mins you can reach downtown, a river, a historic place or a cave - it’s all nearby, everything is.</p>
<p>Europe values work-life balance like no one else. I still believe if anyone wants to have fun in life and doesn't want to work too hard, get a job in Europe.</p>
<p>But back then, Covid was at its peak. It didn’t affect my life in Sweden who was one of the few countries to not implement ban on anything. However, I didn’t get to see enough of Europe or attended enough concerts as I had hoped for. I only got to travel in my last year, and it was already too late - the dark winters in Stockholm had taken a hit on me.</p>
<p>Two and half years passed by. I experienced the peak of my career. Got to be known as “The Backstage Guy” in the Open Source community. I saw the team grew from 10 to 50 and onboarded many engineers, many of them were far more skilled and experienced than me. I had learned a lot at Spotify and is one of the best companies to be working for as an engineer.</p>
<p>The timezone difference was not that different either. Again 4 hours and I was able to connect with my family and friends. I found some good friends back there as well. However, during that time, my grandmother passed away. This was the first time I had experienced death in my family. Someone I knew was no more in this world. I was not able to go back in time and mourn with family. Though I was not extremely attached to my grandma, it made me think - <em>what if I had lost someone else, someone far closer to me?</em> It was also the time when I became a lot closer to my lovely childhood friend, who is now my wife. After many years, it made no sense to me to live far from her.</p>
<p>In all the European and work life glory, something was not working out.</p>
<h2 id="you-know-you-can-come-back-right"><a href="#you-know-you-can-come-back-right" aria-label="you know you can come back right permalink"></a><em>“You know you can come back right?”</em></h2>
<p>One fine day, I was sitting in my living room. I had gained about 25 KGs of additional weight in the past year. It was three in the afternoon and the sun had already set. I was on a video call with my dad. We were talking about a few things, one of them being Russia’s invasion on Ukraine. He was quiet worried about the situations in Europe. I said Sweden had no bone in this fight so don’t worry about it. But then after the conversation, he was about to hang up, as mom had called for the evening tea. Just then, something hit me and I froze. <em>I was alone in this apartment, middle of nowhere. Why was I not there with them, having that cup of tea?</em></p>
<p>I broke. Tears streamed down my face and I had no words. What could I have said? That I am an incapable, grown man who can’t even live on his own? Someone who can’t move on from family? At that moment, I just wanted to hug my father, but I couldn’t.</p>
<p>He kept asking - <em>What happened? Why are you crying? Are you not well?</em></p>
<p>Silence. I had no words to explain what I was feeling. It was definitely the <em>Chai</em>, now that I think about it. Us Indians, huh.</p>
<p>After few minutes, he said something that unlocked a door in my perception that I had never opened. He said, <em>“You know you can always come back right? No one is forcing you to live there. You can have an amazing life back in India too.”</em></p>
<p>To be honest, I didn’t know this. I really did not know this! All I knew, was that you are supposed to move abroad when you grow up. Moving abroad is synonymous with being successful, filling up your bank account. It takes your career to the moon and gives you the highest level of status possible among your peers. I thought that was the only, most respectful way.</p>
<p>The very next day, I wrote an email to my General Manager that I am moving to India. Spotify didn’t permit engineers to work from India, so I knew this was not going to work out. But at that moment, I just wanted to go back home and hug my father - and no job or salary was going to stop me from doing that.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Spotify valued the work I was doing with Backstage and exceptionally permitted me to work from India. I was their first R&amp;D hire here.</p>
<h2 id="back-home"><a href="#back-home" aria-label="back home permalink"></a>Back home</h2>
<p>Once I had made the decision to move, I decided to update my friends about it. I put up a WhatsApp status and also made a post on LinkedIn. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6944645250938241024/">My post went viral</a> with 5 million views, 28,000 reactions and 900 comments.</p>
<p>My decision to move back was shocking to many. Many of my friends who lived abroad related to the challenges of loneliness and cultural shock with me. It was also post-Covid era, where many realized remote work is possible and being in the same location all the time is not needed. Startups were blooming, many of them hiring engineering exclusively in India. There was a mass reverse-brain drain happening in that moment, it still is happening, and I am very excited about it!</p>
<p>I moved back home, starting living in Mumbai with my wife and family. I now get to spend time with my parents without having to plan my days and think about my international travels. Back then, any travel would be 2-4 weeks and there was no room to catchup with an old friend in a different city. I had missed so many reunions, marriages and family events. I now attend them all.</p>
<p>My mental health has now fully recovered. My physical health is coming along, long way to go still.</p>
<p>I work remotely at Harness as a Product Manager, the best job I could be doing right now. I fly to Bangalore every quarter to meet my team in person and spend a lot of time with my colleagues in the US over Zoom. I like working late, my most productive hours are 6-10PM. In childhood, this was the time after school where I would sit to study without any distractions. In college, this was the time after classes for club meetups, project discussions or just writing code. Even at work, my most important meetings happen in the evening. Some see it as a cost of living in India, for me this works just fine. Maybe things will change after having kids.</p>
<h2 id="so-why-dont-you-move-abroad-now"><a href="#so-why-dont-you-move-abroad-now" aria-label="so why dont you move abroad now permalink"></a>So, why don’t you move abroad now?</h2>
<p>I think people should live where they are the happiest. Happiness sparks creativity and is responsible for overall success. Yes, moving to US increases my chances of professional career success, I’ll get to be in proximity with people who have ideas and money to make the ideas come alive. But for me, it comes with significant emotional damage. For some people out there, this is a sacrifice worth making. This was a lot true 20 years ago. The internet age has changed everything. It is now possible to balance career, wealth and happiness while living in India as a techie.</p>
<p><em>“Why don’t you move to the US with your wife? You’ll have family and friends around.”</em></p>
<p>Let me put it in a way which doesn’t offend people - very few of my friends in the US are my real friends. My best friends in US are all planning to move back. My other friends are stuck in the whirlwind of H1Bs and Green Card applications and coping up with their emotional challenges. I wish the best for all of them, but I do not enjoy that lifestyle - it reeks of captivity and not freedom.</p>
<p><em>“If you plan to start your own company, shouldn’t you move out of India?”</em></p>
<p>Yes I do intend to create a company in the future. And yes, most likely the customers are going to be in the west. However, I have seen enough companies with India based founders that I have full confidence I do not have to move personally to make the company successful. I’ll travel frequently and stay up late - which I already do in some sense. We live in a global internet-enabled world.</p>
<p>It’s also not that easy. Visas make it extremely hard for Indians to start a company in the US. The whole process makes me want to puke. The Government and popular opinion seems to be heading in an opposite direction. The dehumanizing experience is similar to my take on campus placements in college above.</p>
<p><em>“Why don’t you move temporarily for a few years?”</em></p>
<p>Maybe for 3 months, yes. Moving for 2 years is a slippery slope of accepting the emotional damage which I will cause to myself and my wife. The drug called monthly salary will keep adding band-aids to the damage and it will again be too late before I realize the repercussions.</p>
<p><em>“If you don’t move, it will affect your career.”</em></p>
<p>For me, success is both the professional success and emotional wellbeing. I am willing to sacrifice some of my professional success for the other. We all have one life.</p>
<h2 id="my-vision-for-india"><a href="#my-vision-for-india" aria-label="my vision for india permalink"></a>My vision for India</h2>
<p>As Richard Feynman says - <em>you are not nameless to yourself, your family and the surrounding ones.</em> When I was 17 in college, my first meaning of life came from doing Open Source and helping others realize that they have much more in them - much more than what the system and society says about them. I uplifted many and showed alternate ways to do well in life. At least, for a few dozen people. A path which did not include Grades and meaningless competitive code grinding.</p>
<p>I think 21st century is a fantastic time to be in a developing nation like India, especially among the tech-enabled hard-working Indians that I know of. I have a lot of hope for my generation. I plan to write more on this in a separate post, when I find time.</p>
<p>Hope you enjoyed reading through this. If at any point, I have hurt your sentiments, I would like to apologize. This is me expressing my own personal views on this very controversial and emotional topic. I still advise people to choose what’s best for them, moving abroad is a great option for many who do not carry emotional baggage like me. We all have one life, and we all should do what’s best for us and our loved ones. Peace.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>I got back <code>places-00000.snappy.parquet</code> through <code>places-00024.snappy.parquet</code>, each file around 455MB for a total of 10.6GB of data.</p>
<p>I ran <code>duckdb</code> and then used DuckDB's ability to remotely query Parquet on S3 to explore the data a bit more without downloading it to my laptop first:</p>
<pre><code>select count(*) from 's3://fsq-os-places-us-east-1/release/dt=2024-11-19/places/parquet/places-00000.snappy.parquet';
</code></pre>
<p>This got back 4,180,424 - that number is similar for each file, suggesting around 104,000,000 records total.</p>
<p>The I ran this query to retrieve 1,000 places from that first file as newline-delimited JSON:</p>
<pre><code>copy (
    select * from 's3://fsq-os-places-us-east-1/release/dt=2024-11-19/places/parquet/places-00000.snappy.parquet'
    limit 1000
) to '/tmp/places.json';
</code></pre>
<p>Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/53ad57ad42c7efe75e2028d975907180">that places.json file</a>, and here it is <a href="https://lite.datasette.io/?json=https://gist.github.com/simonw/53ad57ad42c7efe75e2028d975907180#/data/raw">imported into Datasette Lite</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, I got ChatGPT Code Interpreter to <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/673d7b92-0b4c-8006-a442-c5e6c2713d9c">convert that file to GeoJSON</a> and pasted the result <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/1e2a170b7368932ebd3922cb5d234924">into this Gist</a>, giving me a map of those thousand places (because Gists automatically render GeoJSON):</p>

	<article>
		<p>Vital personal and business information flows over the Internet more frequently than ever, and we don’t always know when it’s happening. It’s clear at this point that encrypting is something all of us should be doing. Then why don’t we use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">TLS (the successor to SSL)</a> everywhere? Every browser in every device supports it. Every server in every data center supports it. Why don’t we just flip the switch?</p>
<p>The challenge is server certificates. The anchor for any TLS-protected communication is a public-key certificate which demonstrates that the server you’re actually talking to is the server you intended to talk to. For many server operators, getting even a basic server certificate is just too much of a hassle. The application process can be confusing. It usually costs money. It’s tricky to install correctly. It’s a pain to update.</p>
<p>Let’s Encrypt is a new free certificate authority, built on a foundation of cooperation and openness, that lets everyone be up and running with basic server certificates for their domains through a simple one-click process.</p>
<p>Mozilla Corporation, Cisco Systems, Inc., Akamai Technologies, Electronic Frontier Foundation, IdenTrust, Inc., and researchers at the University of Michigan are working through the Internet Security Research Group (“ISRG”), a California public benefit corporation, to deliver this much-needed infrastructure in Q2 2015. The ISRG welcomes other organizations dedicated to the same ideal of ubiquitous, open Internet security.</p>
<p>The key principles behind Let’s Encrypt are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Free:</strong> Anyone who owns a domain can get a certificate validated for that domain at zero cost.</li>
<li><strong>Automatic:</strong> The entire enrollment process for certificates occurs painlessly during the server’s native installation or configuration process, while renewal occurs automatically in the background.</li>
<li><strong>Secure:</strong> Let’s Encrypt will serve as a platform for implementing modern security techniques and best practices.</li>
<li><strong>Transparent:</strong> All records of certificate issuance and revocation will be available to anyone who wishes to inspect them.</li>
<li><strong>Open:</strong> The automated issuance and renewal protocol will be an open standard and as much of the software as possible will be open source.</li>
<li><strong>Cooperative:</strong> Much like the underlying Internet protocols themselves, Let’s Encrypt is a joint effort to benefit the entire community, beyond the control of any one organization.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to help these organizations in making TLS Everywhere a reality, here’s how you can get involved:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://letsencrypt.org/sponsors/" hreflang="">Sponsor ISRG</a></li>

<p>The real-time renderer EEVEE now supports Light Linking and Shadow Linking—features previously available only in Cycles.</p>



<div>
<div>
<h2>More control than eeveer before.</h2>



<p>With light linking, lights can be set to affect only specific objects in the scene.</p>



<p>Shadow linking additionally gives control over which objects acts as shadow blockers for a light.</p>



<p>This is now feature parity with Cycles.</p>

<h3>F82 Tint</h3>



<p>The F82 Tint approximation is artist friendly, taking colors as inputs. This is currently in use by the <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/4.3/render/shader_nodes/shader/principled.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/4.3/render/shader_nodes/shader/principled.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Principled BSDF</a>.</p>



<h3>Conductor Fresnel</h3>



<p>This method is more complex to use, requiring IOR and Extinction coefficients per color channel as inputs. However, it can produce subtly more accurate results for real-world metals, previously achievable only through custom <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/4.3/render/shader_nodes/osl.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/4.3/render/shader_nodes/osl.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OSL</a> scripts.</p>



<p>EEVEE does not yet support the Conductor Fresnel type, so it internally remaps the IOR and Extinction coefficients to colors and uses them with the F82 Tint approximation.</p>

<h2>Minimum Stretch,<br>Minimal Effort</h2>



<p>A new iterative unwrapping method “Minimum Stretch” has been added which can deliver results with less distortion by iteratively refining the result.</p>



<p>Ideal for organic shapes. This uses the <strong>SLIM</strong> algorithm (Scalable Local Injective Mappings) internally, see the&nbsp;<a href="https://igl.ethz.ch/projects/slim/">research publication</a>.</p>



<p>It can be used from the Unwrap menu as well as “Live Unwrap”.</p>

<h2><strong>Group</strong> Hug</h2>



<p>Organize your layers into Layer Groups! A new way to keep your Grease Pencil objects tidy.</p>



<p>They allow for easy toggling of visibility, locking, and onion skinning for all the layers in the group.</p>



<p>Additionally, they can be color-coded using <mark>c</mark><mark>o</mark><mark>l</mark><mark>o</mark><mark>r</mark> tags, similar to Collections in the Outliner.</p>

<div>
<h2>No Trace Left Behind</h2>



<p>The eraser has been rewritten to allow strokes to be “cut”.</p>



<p>Instead of just deleting points, it now correctly solves for the intersections of the eraser’s edge and creates new points on the stroke.</p>



<p>The Soft eraser also does this but for multiple levels of transparency radiating outwards from the center of the eraser.</p>

    <p>BM25, or Best Match 25, is a widely used algorithm for full text search. It is the default in Lucene/Elasticsearch and SQLite, among others. Recently, it has become common to combine full text search and vector similarity search into "hybrid search". I wanted to understand how full text search works, and specifically BM25, so here is my attempt at understanding by re-explaining.</p>

I started off using <a href="https://emschwartz.me/binary-vector-embeddings-are-so-cool/">vector similarity search</a> and wanted to also include full-text search to improve the handling of exact keywords (for example, a friend has "Solid.js" as an interest and using vector similarity search alone, that turns up more content related to React than Solid).</p>
<p>The question that motivated this deep dive into BM25 was: <strong>can I compare the BM25 scores of documents across multiple queries to determine which query the document best matches?</strong></p>
<p>Initially, both ChatGPT and Claude told me no — though annoyingly, after doing this deep dive and formulating a more precise question, they both said yes 🤦‍♂️. Anyway, let's get into the details of BM25 and then I'll share my conclusions about this question.</p>
<h2 id="ranking-documents-probabilistically">Ranking documents probabilistically</h2><p>At the most basic level, the goal of a full text search algorithm is to take a query and find the <em>most relevant</em> documents from a set of possibilities.</p>
<p>However, we don't <em>really</em> know which documents are "relevant", so the best we can do is guess. Specifically, we can rank documents based on the <em>probability</em> that they are relevant to the query. (This is called <em>The Probability Ranking Principle</em>.)</p>
<p>How do we calculate the probability that a document is relevant?</p>
<p>For full text or <em>lexical</em> search, we are only going to use qualities of the search query and each of the documents in our collection. (In contrast, vector similarity search might use an embedding model trained on an external corpus of text to represent the meaning or <em>semantics</em> of the query and document.)</p>
<h2 id="components-of-bm25">Components of BM25</h2><p>BM25 uses a couple of different components of the query and the set of documents:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Query terms</strong>: if a search query is made up of multiple terms, BM25 will calculate a separate score for each term and then sum them up.</li>
<li><strong>Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)</strong>: how rare is a given search term across the entire document collection? We assume that common words (such as "the" or "and") are less informative than rare words. Therefore, we want to boost the importance of rare words.</li>
<li><strong>Term frequency in the document</strong>: how many times does a search term appear in a given document? We assume that more repetition of a query term in a given document increases the likelihood that that document is related to the term. However, BM25 also adjusts this so that there are diminishing returns each time a term is repeated.</li>
<li><strong>Document length</strong>: how long is the given document compared to others? Long documents might repeat the search term more, just by virtue of being longer. We don't want to unfairly boost long documents, so BM25 applies some normalization based on how the document's length compares to the average.</li>
</ul>
<p>These four components are what make up BM25. Now, let's look at exactly how they're used.</p>
<h2 id="behold-math">Behold, math!</h2><p>The BM25 algorithm might look scary to non-mathematicians (my eyes glazed over the first time I saw it), but I promise, it's not too hard to understand!</p>
<p>Here is the full equation:</p>

</ul>
<p>This part of the equation says: given a document and a query, sum up the scores for each of the query terms.</p>
<p>Now, let's dig into how we calculate the score for each of the query terms.</p>
<h3 id="inverse-document-frequency-idf">Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)</h3><p>The first component of the score calculates how rare the query term is within the whole collection of documents using the Inverse Document Frequency (IDF).</p>
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><mrow><mi>ln</mi><mrow><mo stretchy="true" fence="true" form="prefix">(</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>N</mi><mo>−</mo><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>q</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>+</mo><mn>0.5</mn></mrow><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>q</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>+</mo><mn>0.5</mn></mrow></mfrac><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn><mo stretchy="true" fence="true" form="postfix">)</mo></mrow></mrow></math><p>The key elements to focus on in this equation are:</p>
<ul>
<li><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>N</mi></mrow></math> is the total number of documents in our collection</li>
<li><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>q</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></math> is the number of documents that contain the query term</li>

</ul>
<p>In simple language, this part boils down to the following: common terms will appear in many documents. If the term appears in many documents, we will have a small number (<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>N</mi><mo>−</mo><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>q</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></math>, or the number of documents that <em>do not</em> have the term) divided by <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>N</mi></mrow></math>. As a result, common terms will have a small effect on the score.</p>
<p>In contrast, rare terms will appear in few documents so <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>q</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></math> will be small and <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>N</mi><mo>−</mo><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>q</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></math> will be large. Therefore, rare terms will have a greater impact on the score.</p>
<p>The constants <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mn>0.5</mn></mrow></math> and <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow></math> are there to smooth out the equation and ensure that we don't end up with wildly varying results if the term is either very rare or very common.</p>
<h3 id="term-frequency-in-the-document">Term frequency in the document</h3><p>In the previous step, we looked at how rare the term is across the whole set of documents. Now, let's look at how frequent the given query is in the given document.</p>
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>q</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>,</mo><mi>D</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>q</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>,</mo><mi>D</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>k</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow></mfrac></mrow></math><p>The terms in this equation are:</p>
<ul>
<li><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>q</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></mrow></math> is a given query</li>
<li><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>D</mi></mrow></math> is a given document</li>
<li><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>q</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>,</mo><mi>D</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></math> is the frequency of the given query in the given document</li>
<li><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>k</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow></math> is a tuning parameter that is generally set between <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mn>1.2</mn></mrow></math> and <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></math></li>
</ul>
<p>This equation takes the term frequency within the document into effect, but ensures that term repetition has diminishing returns. The intuition here is that, at some point, the document is probably related to the query term and we don't want an infinite amount of repetition to be weighted too heavily in the score.</p>
<p>The <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>k</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow></math> parameter controls how quickly the returns to term repetition diminish. You can see how the slope changes based on this setting:</p>

<h3 id="document-length-normalization">Document length normalization</h3><p>The last thing we need is to compare the length of the given document to the lengths of the other documents in the collection.</p>

<li><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>b</mi></mrow></math> is another tuning parameter that controls how much we normalize by the document length</li>
</ul>
<p>Long documents are likely to contain the search term more frequently, just by virtue of being longer. Since we don't want to unfairly boost long documents, this whole term is going to go in the denominator of our final equation. That is, a document that is longer than average (<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mo stretchy="false">|</mo><mi>D</mi><mo stretchy="false">|</mo></mrow><mrow><mi>a</mi><mi>v</mi><mi>g</mi><mi>d</mi><mi>l</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>&gt;</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></math>) will be penalized by this adjustment.</p>
<p><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>b</mi></mrow></math> can be adjusted by the user. Setting <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>b</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow></math> turns off document length normalization, while setting <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>b</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></math> applies it fully.

<h3 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it all together</h3><p>If we take all of the components we've just discussed and put them together, we arrive back at the full BM25 equation:</p>

For each, we are taking the Inverse Document Frequency, multiplying it by the term frequency in the document (with diminishing returns), and then normalizing by the document length.</p>
<h2 id="cleverness-of-bm25-and-its-precursors">Cleverness of BM25 and its precursors</h2><p>We've just gone through the components of the BM25 equation, but I think it's worth pausing to emphasize two of its most ingenious aspects.</p>
<h3 id="ranking-by-probability-without-calculating-probability">Ranking by probability without calculating probability</h3><p>As mentioned earlier, BM25 is based on an idea called the Probability Ranking Principle. In short, it says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If retrieved documents are ordered by decreasing probability of relevance on the data available, then the system’s effectiveness is the best that can be obtained for the data.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.staff.city.ac.uk/~sbrp622/papers/foundations_bm25_review.pdf">The Probabilistic Relevance Framework: BM25 and Beyond</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, calculating the "true" probability that a document is relevant to a query is nearly impossible.</p>
<p>However, we really care about the <em>order</em> of the documents more than we care about the exact probability. Because of this, researchers realized that you could simplify the equations and make it practicable. Specifically, you could drop terms from the equation that would be required to calculate the full probability but where leaving them out would not affect the <em>order</em>.</p>
<p>Even though we are using the Probability Ranking Principle, we are actually calculating a "weight" instead of a probability.</p>

</ul>
<p>The various terms boil down to the probability that we would see a certain query term frequency within the document if the document is relevant or not relevant, and the probabilities that the term would not appear at all if the document is relevant or not.</p>
<p>The Robertson/Sparck Jones Weight is a way of estimating these probabilities but only using the counts of different sets of documents:</p>

<p>The big, glaring problem with this equation is that you first need to know which documents are relevant to the query. How are we going to get those?</p>
<h3 id="assuming-most-documents-are-irrelevant">Assuming most documents are irrelevant</h3><p>The question about how to make use of the Robertson/Sparck Joes weight apparently stumped the entire research field for about 15 years. The equation was built up from a solid theoretical foundation, but relying on already having relevance information made it nearly impossible to put to use.</p>
<p>The BM25 developers made a very clever assumption to get to the next step.</p>
<p>For any given query, we can assume that most documents are not going to be relevant. If we assume that the number of relevant documents is so small as to be negligible, we can just set those numbers to zero!</p>

<h2 id="conclusion-bm25-scores-can-be-compared-emwithin-the-same-collectionem">Conclusion: BM25 scores can be compared <em>within the same collection</em></h2><p>As I mentioned at the start, my motivating question was whether I could compare BM25 scores for a document across queries to understand which query the document best matches.</p>
<p>In general, BM25 scores cannot be directly compared (and this is what ChatGPT and Claude stressed to me in response to my initial inquiries 🙂‍↔️). The algorithm does not produce a score from 0 to 1 that is easy to compare across systems, and it doesn't even try to estimate the probability that a document is relevant. It only focuses on ranking documents within a certain collection in an order that approximates the probability of their relevance to the query. A higher BM25 score means the document is likely to be <em>more relevant</em>, but it isn't the actual probability that it is relevant.</p>
<p>As far as I understand now, it is possible to compare the BM25 scores across queries <em>for the same document within the same collection of documents</em>.</p>
<p>My hint that this was the case was the fact that BM25 sums the scores of each query term. There should not be a semantic difference between comparing the scores for two query term and two whole queries.</p>
<p>The important caveat to stress, however, is the <em>same document within the same collection</em>. BM25 uses the IDF or rarity of terms as well as the average document length within the collection. Therefore, you cannot necessarily compare scores across time because any modifications to the overall collection could change the scores.</p>
<p>For my purposes, though, this is useful enough. It means that I can do a full text search for each of a user's interests in my collection of content and compare the BM25 scores to help determine which pieces best match their interests.</p>
<p>I'll write more about ranking algorithms and how I'm using the relevance scores in future posts, but in the meantime I hope you've found this background on BM25 useful or interesting!</p>
<p><em>Thanks to Alex Kesling and Natan Last for feedback on drafts of this post.</em></p>
<h2 id="further-reading">Further reading</h2><p>If you are interested in diving further into the theory and history of BM25, I would highly recommend watching Elastic engineer Britta Weber's 2016 talk <a href="https://www.elastic.co/elasticon/conf/2016/sf/improved-text-scoring-with-bm25">Improved Text Scoring with BM25</a> and reading <a href="https://www.staff.city.ac.uk/~sbrp622/papers/foundations_bm25_review.pdf">The Probabilistic Relevance Framework: BM25 and Beyond</a> by Stephen Robertson and Hugo Zaragoza.</p>
<p>Also, I had initially included comparisons between BM25 and some other algorithms in this post. But, as you know, it was already a bit long 😅. So, you can now find those in this other post: <a href="https://emschwartz.me/comparing-full-text-search-algorithms-bm25-tf-idf-and-postgres">Comparing full text search algorithms: BM25, TF-IDF, and Postgres</a>.</p>

				<h3>from the <i>was-that-so-hard?</i> dept</h3>
				


				<p>One of the most frustrating aspects in the ongoing conversation around the <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/tag/preservation/">preservation</a> of older video games, also known as cultural output, is the collision of IP rights and some publishers’ unwillingness to both continue to support and make available these older games and their refusal to release those same games into the public domain so that others can do so. It creates this crazy situation in which a company insists on retaining its copyrights over a video game that it has effectively disappeared with no good or legitimate way for the public to preserve them. As I’ve argued for some time now, this breaks the copyright contract with the public and should come with repercussions. The whole bargain that is copyright law is that creative works are granted a limited monopoly on the production of that work, with that work eventually arriving into the public domain. If that arrival is not allowed to occur, the bargain is broken, and not by anyone who would supposedly “infringe” on the copyright of that work.</p>
<p>Why would game publishers do this sort of thing? There are plenty of theories. The fad of retro-gaming is such that publishers can claim they are reserving their rights for an eventual remastered version, or otherwise a re-released version, of these games. Sometimes they even follow through on those plans. In other cases, some companies are just so ingrained in IP protectionism that they can’t see past their own nose (hi there, <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/company/nintendo/">Nintendo</a>!). In still other cases the companies that published the game no longer exist, and <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2020/11/11/happy-20th-birthday-to-no-one-lives-forever-classic-pc-game-that-cant-be-sold-today-thanks-to-ip/">unraveling</a> who now holds the rights to their games can be an absolute nightmare.</p>
<p>But it just doesn’t have to be like this. Companies could be willing to give up their iron-fisted control over their IP for these older games they aren’t willing to support or preserve themselves and let others do it for them. And if you need a real world example of that, you need look only at how <a href="https://kotaku.com/unreal-engine-epic-free-internet-archive-fortnite-1851698320">Epic is working with The Internet Archive</a> to do exactly that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Epic, now primarily known for&nbsp;Fortnite&nbsp;and the Unreal Engine, has given permission for two of the most significant video games ever made,&nbsp;Unreal&nbsp;and&nbsp;Unreal Tournament, to be freely accessed via the Internet Archive. As spotted by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/classic-shooters-unreal-and-unreal-tournament-are-now-free-and-preserved-on-the-internet-archive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RPS</a>, via&nbsp;<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/epic-games-gives-the-thumbs-up-to-archive-org-copies-of-unreal-gold-and-unreal-tournament-goty-free-to-download-for-all.1035414/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ResetEra</a>, the OldUnreal group announced the move on their Discord, along with instructions for how to easily download and play them on modern machines.</em></p>
<p><em>Huge kudos to Epic for being cool with this, because while it shouldn’t be unusual to happily let people freely share a three-decade-old game you don’t sell any more, it’s vanishingly rare. And if you remain in any doubt, we just got word back from Epic confirming they’re on board.</em></p>
<p><em>“We can confirm that&nbsp;Unreal 1&nbsp;and&nbsp;Unreal Tournament&nbsp;are available on&nbsp;<a href="http://archive.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">archive.org</a>,” a spokesperson told us by email, “and people are free to independently link to and play these versions.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Importantly, OldUnreal and The Internet Archive very much know what they’re doing here. Grabbing the ZIP file for the game sleekly pulls the ISO directly from The Internet Archive, installs it, and there are instructions for how to get the game up and running on modern hardware. This is obviously a labor of love from fans dedicated toward keeping these two excellent games alive.</p>
<p>And the size and success of these games is important, too. It would be all too easy for Epic to keep this IP to itself with a plan for a remastered version of each game, or for a forthcoming sequel, or anything like that. Instead, Epic has just opened up and allowed the internet to do its thing in preserving these important titles using one of the most trustworthy sources to do so. </p>
<p>But this is just two games. What would be really nice to see is this become a trend, or, better yet, a program run by The Internet Archive. Don’t want to bother to preserve your old game? No problem, let the IA do it for you!</p>

But the kind of game this is, goals-wise - and the fact the devs could charge $15 for it, despite being so freeform - is super interesting. So don’t dismiss it out of hand.</span></p><p>To finish up, here’s a brief Q&amp;A we had with Ana &amp; Tom. We don’t generally reprint these in full. But the answers they had were so fascinating, we felt we had to. Ta da:</p><div><p><span>Q: </span><strong>There's a trend recently for games that really don't have strong failure states or put any pressure on the player. Sometimes </strong><em><strong>'game designers'</strong></em><strong> don't want to design </strong><em><strong>'games'</strong></em><strong> like that. Can you explain why you decided to make Tiny Glade like that?</strong></p><p><span>I think it depends on what kind of experience you're trying to achieve… We wanted to craft a serene space that you can escape to, the childhood feeling that you have all the time in the world. Sometimes you want a high intensity game - but sometimes you just want to kick back and see where your imagination takes you.</span></p></div><div id="youtube2-y579pGbhf-s" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;y579pGbhf-s&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/y579pGbhf-s?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><div><p><strong>Q: How much did you iterate with alpha/beta testers pre-release to polish the game, or did you end up doing a lot of the UI/UX iteration yourself? </strong></p><p><span>Oh, we iterated a lot. Some tools went through 6 or 7 fully fleshed out prototypes before we settled on what you can see in the game today. We first do a simple version that we can test on ourselves. Sometimes that stage alone can take multiple attempts. </span></p></div><p>If it does pass our internal evaluation, we polish it up a bit, and then we run a playtest. If we're lucky, then that version works and then it's about smoothing the rough edges, doing micro iterations, so to say. But often things don't work like you'd expect, and you need to go back to the drawing board and try again. </p><div><p><span>Sometimes you can only tell if something works when the rest of the pieces are at a certain level of completion. It's a very, very iterative process, where you work on all the pieces together, fleshing them all out little by little. Before we shipped, we had 5 external playtests in the two year development period.</span></p><p><strong>Q: Do you have two or three rules of 'game feel' that you think you did great in Tiny Glade? It's clear that 'game feel' is a big part of its success!</strong></p><p><span>Yes! We actually outlined design pillars in the very beginning of the development. They were </span><em>"a lot from little effort"</em><span>, </span><em>"no wrong answers"</em><span>, </span><em>"it's alive" </em><span>(the latter referring to the world reacting to what you've built, such as ivy, birds, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/RUNCTeKy7RM" rel="">sheep</a><span>, etc). </span></p></div><p><span>For the 'game feel', I think </span><em>"a lot from little effort"</em><span> is probably the biggest one. Whenever you draw a wall, change roof shape, drag out fences, a lot of stuff is being generated right here and now, just on your whim. Each brick, pebble and plank is carefully placed by the game. </span></p><p>With anything that's generated, we aim for it to feel hand-crafted and perfectly imperfect, as if someone manually constructed all these things just for you. You can hear it from the sound design too. We wanted it to be very tactile, and have an association with real materials, as if you're building a diorama in real life.</p><div id="youtube2-cvswAg5Lrtw" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;cvswAg5Lrtw&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cvswAg5Lrtw?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><div><p><strong>Q: Tech-wise, I was blown away that</strong><em><strong> [often high-end focused game tech eggheads]</strong></em><strong><span> Digital Foundry </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvswAg5Lrtw" rel="">gave you a rave video review</a><span>! Congrats on that - the tech is standout. Do you have any tech inspirations, and do you think procedural elements are still under-used in games?</span></strong></p><p><span>Thank you :D From a rendering perspective, the biggest inspirations were </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/48000/LIMBO/" rel="">Limbo</a><span> &amp; </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/304430/INSIDE/" rel="">Inside</a><span>. There, you don't need to tweak a million settings in options to get a beautiful experience from the start. You launch the game, and you’re immediately in it. </span></p></div><div><p><span>We strived for the full experience to be the same across all machines, so that you could experience beautiful lighting even on low-end PCs. When it comes to lighting technologies, after many iterations, Tiny Glade actually ended up being similar to </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/412020/Metro_Exodus/" rel="">Metro Exodus</a><span> :D</span></p><p><span>I think we’re used to seeing procedural techniques used for generating huge worlds, or </span><em>‘infinite’</em><span> content. So one could say that procedural is used to a narrow extent. But that might be just a matter of semantics, because one could also draw parallels between procedural generation and systemic gameplay. </span></p></div><p><span>Many games amplify your input via multiple layered systems; they might just not be labeled as</span><em> "procedural generation"</em><span>. You could even say that </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKtUyggrxoQ" rel="">the wand design system in Noita</a><span> is procedural generation. We happen to use it to make the act of creation satisfying and responsive instead.</span></p><p><span>It’s true that a dominant platform-led status quo can be smothering. But for practical reasons, grumbling about it often gets suppressed. So it’s fascinating to see a spinoff of </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/632470/Disco_Elysium__The_Final_Cut/" rel="">Disco Elysium</a><span> studio ZA/UM - a game very much forged in radical politics - </span><a href="https://www.vg247.com/disco-elysium-spin-off-studio-summer-eternal-on-chances-of-things-getting-better-for-game-devs" rel="">go straight for the jugular about the workers vs. the ruling (platform) parties</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Banger quote #1, from </span><a href="https://summereternal.com/" rel="">Summer Eternal</a><span>’s Aleksandar Gavrilović? </span><em><span>“I am still eagerly awaiting a second crisis [beyond the current layoffs], one which would spotlight the largest structural issue in game development… </span><strong><span>one third of all PC revenue from all developers (from indies to AAA) is syphoned to digital </span><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fiefdom" rel="">fiefdoms</a><span>, of which Valve is the most egregious example</span></strong><span>. </span></em></p><p><em><span>I can imagine a near future with more worker power, but I </span><strong>lack the imagination to envision the replacement of Valve with a community owned alternative</strong><span>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-framer-name="Content" data-framer-component-type="RichTextContainer"><p>In June, Meta released an article titled <!--$--><a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2024/06/24/data-infrastructure/leveraging-ai-for-efficient-incident-response/" rel="noopener">Leveraging AI for efficient incident response</a><!--/$--> on their engineering blog. In this article, engineers outline how they leveraged large language models to improve Meta's incident response capabilities. The headline metric from this report: <strong>Meta was able to use LLMs to successfully root cause incidents with 42% accuracy</strong> in their web monorepo. This means that nearly half the time, the <strong>mean time to resolution (MTTR) can potentially be reduced from hours to seconds</strong>. Seeing one of the largest and most complex engineering organizations in the world use generative AI for incident response so successfully gives us hope that we can bring the same benefit to all engineering teams with <!--$--><a href="https://tryparity.com/" rel="noopener">Parity</a><!--/$-->. Let's dive into how Meta accomplished these results and what we can learn from it.</p><h2>Meta's Incident Management at Scale</h2><p>It can be hard to appreciate the scale and velocity of code changes at a company the size of Meta. They are shipping thousands of changes per day almost entirely within a <!--$--><a href="https://blog.3d-logic.com/2024/09/02/what-it-is-like-to-work-in-metas-facebooks-monorepo/" rel="noopener">single monorepo</a><!--/$-->. Meta literally <!--$--><a href="https://graphite.dev/blog/why-facebook-doesnt-use-git" rel="noopener">re-engineered Mercurial</a><!--/$--> to keep up with the speed at which their codebase was growing (really fun read and nugget of open source history). At this scale, investigating outages becomes a massive undertaking. "Hey did anyone ship anything recently" in #engineering probably doesn't cut it as a response process.</p><p>Meta has invested in sophisticated incident response tools to make the life of on-call engineers easier. All of that tooling is built to solve the same problem any engineer at any organization aims to solve: <strong>what's going wrong, why is it going wrong, and how do we fix it</strong>. Generative AI has clear potential to improve MTTR and incident management processes across the board, and Meta charts one of the potential paths to doing so.</p><h2>Meta's Approach to LLMs for Incident Response</h2><p>Meta's approach to LLMs for incident response enhances the speed and accuracy of RCA by surfacing likely root causes to engineers at the start of their investigation. To handle the complexity of investigating issues within their massive monolithic codebase, they first use heuristic-based retrieval methods to select a subset of code changes and then use LLM-based ranking to narrow in. The retrieval phase reduces the overwhelming number of potential changes by using heuristics like code ownership, directory structures, and runtime code graphs. Once the search space is narrowed down, only the most relevant changes are passed along for deeper analysis by LLMs.</p><p><img alt="How Meta scopes down code changes with heuristics and LLMs" data-framer-asset="data:framer/asset-reference,NZp9ysyAbkYwFzYyzMEyCwlCmc.png" data-framer-height="682" data-framer-width="1536" height="341" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/NZp9ysyAbkYwFzYyzMEyCwlCmc.png" srcset="https://framerusercontent.com/images/NZp9ysyAbkYwFzYyzMEyCwlCmc.png?scale-down-to=512 512w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/NZp9ysyAbkYwFzYyzMEyCwlCmc.png?scale-down-to=1024 1024w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/NZp9ysyAbkYwFzYyzMEyCwlCmc.png 1536w" width="768" data-framer-original-sizes="" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 100vw, (min-width: 810px) and (max-width: 1199px) 100vw, (max-width: 809px) 100vw"></p><p><em>How Meta scopes down code changes with heuristics and LLMs</em></p><p>The tool fits right into Meta’s existing incident management processes. Engineers investigate issues just as they normally would, but now, the AI results are surfaced at the start of an investigation, automatically pulling in and ranking the most likely causes of the issue in real time. This means they can quickly focus on the most relevant code changes without spending time digging through thousands of possibilities. Instead of replacing the engineers' expertise, the AI acts as a helpful assistant, focusing them in on the most likely causes of the issue sooner.</p><h2>Fine Tuning Llama 2 7B to Identify Culprit Code Changes</h2><p>One of the particularly interesting innovations behind Meta's AI incident response is the use of a fine-tuned Llama 2 7B model. The model was tuned specifically for root cause analysis by training it on historical incident investigations, which allowed it to learn from past scenarios where the underlying cause was already known. They used a two-phase approach for fine-tuning: starting with continued pre-training (CPT) and followed by a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) phase. During CPT, the model was exposed to internal Meta artifacts such as wikis, code repositories, and Q&amp;A documents, giving it a contextual foundation. In the SFT phase, Meta mixed the original training data of Llama 2 with its own root cause analysis dataset, which focused on instruction-tuning examples, enabling the model to follow RCA-related prompts effectively.</p><p><img alt="The fine-tuning process used for Llama 2 7B" data-framer-asset="data:framer/asset-reference,PXBwLHWp7U7VsAwRG3rVAdjcwOQ.png" data-framer-height="407" data-framer-width="896" height="203" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/PXBwLHWp7U7VsAwRG3rVAdjcwOQ.png" srcset="https://framerusercontent.com/images/PXBwLHWp7U7VsAwRG3rVAdjcwOQ.png?scale-down-to=512 512w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/PXBwLHWp7U7VsAwRG3rVAdjcwOQ.png 896w" width="448" data-framer-original-sizes="" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 100vw, (min-width: 810px) and (max-width: 1199px) 100vw, (max-width: 809px) 100vw"></p><p><em>The fine-tuning process used for Llama 2 7B</em></p><p>The fine-tuning dataset was constructed with the constraints of a real-world investigation in mind. Each example involved 2 to 20 potential code changes, with minimal information known at the time of investigation initiation. By training the model this way, Meta equipped it to handle scenarios where data is scarce, making it more applicable to actual investigations. The fine-tuning process enabled the model to generate ranked lists of potential causes, ordered by relevance. The ranking system is built around log probabilities, where the model evaluates how likely each change is to be the root cause based on historical patterns. This fine-tuning process, combined with the aggregation of new datasets, allows Meta's LLM to significantly improve the accuracy of its root cause predictions, achieving a 42% success rate in identifying the culprit code changes during investigations.</p><h2>LLM Agents for Incident Response Are Next (Probably)</h2><p>Meta's use of additional pre-training and fine-tuning on internal documentation and RCA datasets point to another avenue worth exploring: LLM agents for incident response. Agents can actively gather additional relevant context from a larger number of data sources to improve their results. They can also begin to handle more of the incident response process and workflow (find and follow runbooks, measure impact, take mitigation steps, create code changes, write initial post-mortems). Agents are a natural next step, and I'd be surprised if the team isn't already exploring it.</p><h2>42% Accuracy: Good or Bad?</h2><p>The biggest question I had when I read the Meta article was how should I interpret the 42% accuracy result? On the surface, this feels like a disappointing result. While there's no great benchmark for human performance, it still seems quite far from what an engineer could achieve. But when you consider that nearly half the time that an investigation began, an engineer had the root cause handed directly to them, it's an incredible result. As long as the engineer has the context and information to quickly rule out incorrect results, this would likely lead to massive improvements in MTTR. It's also an impressive result for the scale of changes that are being shipped at Meta. At a smaller organization, it's likely that finding culprit commits is a much easier task.</p><h2>Making AI Accessible to All Engineering Teams</h2><p>The way Meta has integrated AI into their incident response process offers a blueprint for other organizations. By using LLMs to prioritize probable root causes, teams can drastically cut down on investigation time, allowing engineers to jump straight into remediation. AI can help by parsing through logs, tracking recent code changes, and correlating potential issues across different environments. Starting with the investigation</p><h2>How Parity Can Bring AI to Your Team's Incident Response</h2><p>Meta is one of the best-resourced engineering teams in the world, and most teams simply don't have armies of researchers with the resources to fine-tune models and experiment with AI technologies. So how does the average team benefit from these insights from Meta? Surely if LLMs can help root cause incidents in one of the most complex infra stacks in the world nearly half the time, they should be helpful for every other engineering organization, right?</p><p>That's exactly our goal at Parity. We've built the world's first AI SRE for incident response to bring these benefits to teams everywhere. We use LLM agents to investigate and root cause issues the same way an engineer would. When an alert from PagerDuty or DataDog triggers, Parity's agent begins to investigate the issue, gather context, and presents its findings to the engineer. This means before an on-call engineer has even opened their laptop, Parity has already done an investigation and engineers can move to remediation faster. We're personally pretty excited about Parity's performance, and the fact that Meta is built a similar tool gives us a lot of confidence that other teams can benefit from these solutions!</p><h2>The Future of Incident Response and AI</h2><p>The exploration of AI's role in incident response is just getting started, and the potential is clear. Humans aren't great at incident response, and we all hate waking up at 2am to resolve an issue. It's not hard to imagine we'll soon be at super-human performance in this problem space. Underlying improvements in model reasoning ability seem well suited to improving performance in the incident response space (we're particularly excited by the potential of <!--$--><a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/" rel="noopener">OpenAI's o1</a><!--/$-->). And we believe agents will play an important role in moving accuracy even higher. A world where engineers no longer have to deal with alerts and can get back to building isn't too far away.</p><p>There is also massive potential in adjacent areas like cybersecurity incidents. It's not too hard to imagine that LLMs will be used to respond to cyber threats or by security analysts to explore new attack vectors and prevent potential threats (check out our friends from YC over at <!--$--><a href="https://asterisk.so/" rel="noopener">Asterisk</a><!--/$--> who are working in this space!)</p><p><em>Note: I would like to acknowledge the great work by the team at Meta that worked on this, and I highly recommend reading the original article from Meta Engineering!</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

<h2 id="using-uv-with-pytorch"><a href="#using-uv-with-pytorch">Using uv with PyTorch</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a> ecosystem is a popular choice for deep learning research and
development. You can use uv to manage PyTorch projects and PyTorch dependencies across different
Python versions and environments, even controlling for the choice of accelerator (e.g., CPU-only vs.
CUDA).</p>
<h2 id="installing-pytorch"><a href="#installing-pytorch">Installing PyTorch</a></h2>
<p>From a packaging perspective, PyTorch has a few uncommon characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many PyTorch wheels are hosted on a dedicated index, rather than the Python Package Index (PyPI).
  As such, installing PyTorch typically often configuring a project to use the PyTorch index.</li>
<li>PyTorch includes distinct builds for each accelerator (e.g., CPU-only, CUDA). Since there's no
  standardized mechanism for specifying these accelerators when publishing or installing, PyTorch
  encodes them in the local version specifier. As such, PyTorch versions will often look like
  <code>2.5.1+cpu</code>, <code>2.5.1+cu121</code>, etc.</li>
<li>Builds for different accelerators are published to different indexes. For example, the <code>+cpu</code>
  builds are published on <a href="https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu">https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu</a>, while the <code>+cu121</code> builds are
  published on <a href="https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121">https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>As such, the necessary packaging configuration will vary depending on both the platforms you need to
support and the accelerators you want to enable.</p>
<p>To start, consider the following (default) configuration, which would be generated by running
<code>uv init --python 3.12</code> followed by <code>uv add torch torchvision</code>.</p>
<p>In this case, PyTorch would be installed from PyPI, which hosts CPU-only wheels for Windows and
macOS, and GPU-accelerated wheels on Linux (targeting CUDA 12.4):</p>

</code></pre></div>
<div>
<p>Supported Python versions</p>
<p>At time of writing, PyTorch does not yet publish wheels for Python 3.13; as such projects with
<code>requires-python = "&gt;=3.13"</code> may fail to resolve. See the
<a href="https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/RELEASE.md#release-compatibility-matrix">compatibility matrix</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>This is a valid configuration for projects that want to use CPU builds on Windows and macOS, and
CUDA-enabled builds on Linux. However, if you need to support different platforms or accelerators,
you'll need to configure the project accordingly.</p>
<h2 id="using-a-pytorch-index"><a href="#using-a-pytorch-index">Using a PyTorch index</a></h2>
<p>In some cases, you may want to use a specific PyTorch variant across all platforms. For example, you
may want to use the CPU-only builds on Linux too.</p>
<p>In such cases, the first step is to add the relevant PyTorch index to your <code>pyproject.toml</code>:</p>

<p>Rosetta 2 is remarkably fast when compared to other x86-on-ARM emulators. I’ve spent a little time looking at how it works, out of idle curiosity, and found it to be quite unusual, so I figured I’d put together my notes.<a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@dougall"></a></p>



<p>My understanding is a bit rough, and is mostly based on reading the ahead-of-time translated code, and making inferences about the runtime from that. Let me know if you have any corrections, or find any tricks I’ve missed.</p>

<h2>Ahead-of-time translation</h2>



<p>Rosetta 2 translates the entire text segment of the binary from x86 to ARM up-front. It also supports just-in-time (JIT) translation, but that is used relatively rarely, avoiding both the direct runtime cost of compilation, and any indirect instruction and data cache effects.</p>



<p>Other interpreters typically translate code in execution order, which can allow faster startup times, but doesn’t preserve code locality.</p>



<h2>Usually one-to-one translation</h2>



<p>[<em>Correction:</em> an earlier version of this post said that every ahead-of-time translated instruction was a valid entry point. While I still believe it would be valid to jump to almost any ahead-of-time translated instruction, the lookup tables used do not allow for this. I believe this is an optimisation to keep the lookup size small. The prologue/epilogue optimisation was also discovered after the initial version of this post.]</p>



<p>Each x86 instruction is translated to one or more ARM instructions once within the ahead-of-time binary (with the exception of NOPs, which are ignored). When an indirect jump or call sets the instruction pointer to an arbitrary offset in the text segment, the runtime will look up the corresponding translated instruction, and branch there.</p>



<p>This uses an x86 to ARM lookup table that contains all function starts, and other basic blocks that are otherwise not referenced. If it misses this, for example while handling a switch-statement, it can fall back to the JIT.</p>



<p>To allow for precise exception handling, sampling profiling, and attaching debuggers, Rosetta 2 maintains a mapping from translated ARM instructions to their original x86 address, and guarantees that the state will be canonical between each instruction.</p>



<p>This almost entirely prevents inter-instruction optimisations. There are two known exceptions. The first is an “unused-flags” optimisation, which avoids calculating x86 flags value if they are not used before being overwritten on every path from a flag-setting instruction. The other combines function prologues and epilogues, combining push and pop instructions and delaying updates of the stack pointer. In the ARM to x86 address mapping these appear as though they were a single instruction.</p>



<p>There are some tradeoffs to keeping state canonical between each instruction:</p>



<ul>
<li>Either all emulated register values must be kept in host registers, or you need load or store instructions every time certain registers are used. 64-bit x86 has half as many registers as 64-bit ARM, so this isn’t a problem for Rosetta 2, but it would be a significant drawback to this technique for emulating 64-bit ARM on x86, or PPC on 64-bit ARM.</li>



<li>There are very few inter-instruction optimisations, leading to surprisingly poor code generation in some cases. However, in general, the code has already been generated by an optimising compiler for x86, so the benefits of many optimisations would be limited.</li>
</ul>



<p>However there are significant benefits:</p>



<ul>
<li>Generally translating each instruction only once has significant instruction-cache benefits –&nbsp;other emulators typically cannot reuse code when branching to a new target.</li>



<li>Precise exceptions, without needing to store much more information than instruction boundaries.</li>



<li>The debugger (LLDB) works with x86 binaries, and can attach to Rosetta 2 processes.</li>



<li>Having fewer optimisations simplifies code generation, making translation faster. Translation speed is important for both first-start time (where tens of megabytes of code may be translated), and JIT translation time, which is critical to the performance of applications that use JIT compilers.</li>
</ul>



<p>Optimising for the instruction-cache might not <em>seem</em> like a significant benefit, but it typically is in emulators, as there’s already an expansion-factor when translating between instruction sets. Every one-byte x86 push becomes a four byte ARM instruction, and every read-modify-write x86 instruction is three ARM instructions (or more, depending on addressing mode). And that’s if the perfect instruction is available. When the instructions have slightly different semantics, even more instructions are needed to get the required behaviour.</p>



<p>Given these constraints, the goal is generally to get as close to one-ARM-instruction-per-x86-instruction as possible, and the tricks described in the following sections allow Rosetta to achieve this surprisingly often. This keeps the expansion-factor as low as possible. For example, the instruction size expansion factor for an sqlite3 binary is ~1.64x (1.05MB of x86 instructions vs 1.72MB of ARM instructions).</p>



<p>(The two lookups (one from x86 to ARM and the other from ARM to x86) are found via the fragment list found in <strong>LC_AOT_METADATA</strong>. Branch target results are cached in a hash-map. Various structures can be used for these, but in one binary the performance-critical x86 to ARM mapping used a two-level binary search, and the much larger, less-performance-critical ARM to x86 mapping used a top-level binary search, followed by a linear scan through bit-packed data.)</p>



<h2>Memory layout</h2>



<p>An <strong>ADRP</strong> instruction followed by an <strong>ADD</strong> is used to emulate x86’s RIP-relative addressing. This is limited to a +/-1GB range. Rosetta 2 places the translated binary after the non-translated binary in memory, so you roughly have [untranslated code][data][translated code][runtime support code]. This means that <strong>ADRP</strong> can reference data and untranslated code as needed. Loading the runtime support functions immediately after the translated code also allows translated code to make direct calls into the runtime.</p>



<h2>Return address prediction</h2>



<p>All performant processors have a return-address-stack to allow branch prediction to correctly predict return instructions.</p>



<p>Rosetta 2 takes advantage of this by rewriting x86 <strong>CALL</strong> and <strong>RET</strong> instructions to ARM <strong>BL</strong> and <strong>RET</strong> instructions (as well as the architectural loads/stores and stack-pointer adjustments). This also requires some extra book-keeping, saving the expected x86 return-address and the corresponding translated jump target on a special stack when calling, and validating them when returning, but it allows for correct return prediction.</p>



<p>This trick is also used in the GameCube/Wii emulator Dolphin.</p>



<h2>ARM flag-manipulation extensions</h2>



<p>A lot of overhead comes from small differences in behaviour between x86 and ARM, like the semantics of flags. Rosetta 2 uses the ARM flag-manipulation extensions (FEAT_FlagM and FEAT_FlagM2) to handle these differences efficiently.</p>



<p>For example, x86 uses “subtract-with-borrow”, whereas ARM uses “subtract-with-carry”. This effectively inverts the carry flag when doing a subtraction, as opposed to when doing an addition. As <strong>CMP</strong> is a flag-setting subtraction without a result, it’s much more common to use the flags from a subtraction than an addition, so Rosetta 2 chooses inverted as the canonical form of the carry flag. The <strong>CFINV</strong> instruction (carry-flag-invert) is used to invert the carry after any <strong>ADD</strong> operation where the carry flag is used or may escape (and to rectify the carry flag, when it’s the input to an add-with-carry instruction).</p>



<p>x86 shift instructions also require complicated flag handling, as it shifts bits into the carry flag. The <strong>RMIF</strong> instruction (rotate-mask-insert-flags) is used within rosetta to move an arbitrary bit from a register into an arbitrary flag, which makes emulating fixed-shifts (among other things) relatively efficient. Variable shifts remain relatively inefficient if flags escape, as the flags must not be modified when shifting by zero, requiring a conditional branch.</p>



<p>Unlike x86, ARM doesn’t have any 8-bit or 16-bit operations. These are generally easy to emulate with wider operations (which is how compilers implement operations on these values), with the small catch that x86 requires preserving the original high-bits. However, the <strong>SETF8</strong> and <strong>SETF16</strong> instructions help to emulate the flag-setting behaviour of these narrower instructions.</p>



<p>Those were all from FEAT_FlagM. The instructions from FEAT_FlagM2 are <strong>AXFLAG</strong> and <strong>XAFLAG</strong>, which convert floating-point condition flags to/from a mysterious “external format”. By some strange coincidence, this format is x86, so these instruction are used when dealing with floating point flags.</p>



<h2>Floating-point handling</h2>



<p>x86 and ARM both implement IEEE-754, so the most common floating-point operations are almost identical. One exception is the handling of the different possible bit patterns underlying NaN values, and another is whether tininess is detected before or after rounding. Most applications won’t mind if you get this wrong, but some will, and to get it right would require expensive checks on every floating-point operation. Fortunately, this is handled in hardware.</p>



<p>There’s a standard ARM alternate floating-point behaviour extension (FEAT_AFP) from ARMv8.7, but the M1 design predates the v8.7 standard, so Rosetta 2 uses a non-standard implementation.</p>



<p>(What a coincidence – the “alternative” happens to exactly match x86. It’s quite funny to me that ARM will put “Javascript” in the description of an instruction, but needs two different euphemisms for “x86”.)</p>



<h2>Total store ordering (TSO)</h2>



<p>One non-standard ARM extension available on the Apple M1 that has been widely publicised is hardware support for TSO (total-store-ordering), which, when enabled, gives regular ARM load-and-store instructions the same ordering guarantees that loads and stores have on an x86 system.</p>



<p>As far as I know this is not part of the ARM standard, but it also isn’t Apple specific: Nvidia Denver/Carmel and Fujitsu A64fx are other 64-bit ARM processors that also implement TSO (<a href="https://twitter.com/marcan42/status/1534053625110351872">thanks to marcan for these details</a>).</p>



<h2>Apple’s secret extension</h2>



<p>There are only a handful of different instructions that account for 90% of all operations executed, and, near the top of that list are addition and subtraction. On ARM these can optionally set the four-bit NZCV register, whereas on x86 these always set six flag bits: CF, ZF, SF and OF (which correspond well-enough to NZCV), as well as PF (the parity flag) and AF (the adjust flag).</p>



<p>Emulating the last two in software is possible (and seems to be supported by Rosetta 2 for Linux), but can be rather expensive. Most software won’t notice if you get these wrong, but some software will. The Apple M1 has an undocumented extension that, when enabled, ensures instructions like <strong>ADDS</strong>, <strong>SUBS</strong> and <strong>CMP</strong> compute PF and AF and store them as bits 26 and 27 of NZCV respectively, providing accurate emulation with no performance penalty.</p>



<h2>Fast hardware</h2>



<p>Ultimately, the M1 is incredibly fast. By being so much wider than comparable x86 CPUs, it has a remarkable ability to avoid being throughput-bound, even with all the extra instructions Rosetta 2 generates. In some cases (iirc, IDA Pro) there really isn’t much of a speedup going from Rosetta 2 to native ARM.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>I believe there is room for performance improvement in Rosetta 2, by performing more inter-instruction optimisations. However, this would come at the cost of significantly increased complexity (especially for debugging and exception handling), and increased translation times.</p>



<p>Engineering is about making the right tradeoffs, and I’d say Rosetta 2 has done exactly that. While other emulators might require inter-instruction optimisations for performance, Rosetta 2 is able to trust a fast CPU, generate code that respects its caches and predictors, and solve the messiest problems in hardware.</p>



<p>You can follow me at <a href="https://mastodon.social/@dougall"></a><a href="https://mastodon.social/@dougall">@dougall@mastodon.social</a>.</p>



<h2>Update: SSE2 support</h2>



<p>After reading some comments I realised this was a significant omission from the original post. Rosetta 2 provides full emulation for the SSE2 SIMD instruction set. These instructions have been enabled in compilers by default for many years, so this would have been required for compatibility. However, all common operations are translated to a reasonably-optimised sequence of NEON operations. This is critical to the performance of software that has been optimised to use these instructions.</p>



<p>Many emulators also use this SIMD to SIMD translation approach, but other use SIMD to scalar, or call out to runtime support functions for each SIMD operation.</p>



<h2>Update: Unused flag optimisation</h2>



<p>This is one of two inter-instruction optimisations mentioned earlier, but it deserves its own section. Rosetta 2 avoids computing flags when they are unused and don’t escape. This means that even with the flag-manipulation instructions, the vast majority of flag-setting x86 instructions can be translated to non-flag-setting ARM instructions, with no fix-up required. This improves instruction count and size a lot.</p>



<p>It’s even more valuable for Rosetta 2 in Linux VMs. In VMs, Rosetta is unable to enable the Apple parity-flag extension, and instead computes the value manually. (It may or may not also compute the adjust-flag). This is relatively expensive, so it’s very valuable to avoid it.</p>



<h2>Update: Prologue/epilogue combining</h2>



<p>The last inter-instruction optimisation I’m aware of is prologue/epilogue combining. Rosetta 2 finds groups of instructions that set up or tear down stack frames, and merges them, pairing loads and stores, and delaying stack-pointer updates. This is equivalent to the “stack engine” found in hardware implementations of x86.</p>



<p>For example, the following prologue:</p>



<pre><code>push rbp
mov rbp, rsp
push rbx
push rax</code></pre>



<p>Becomes:</p>



<pre><code>stur x5, [x4,#-8]
sub x5, x4, #8
stp x0, x3, [x4,#-0x18]!</code></pre>



<p>This greatly reduces the number of loads, stores, and arithmetic instructions that modify the stack-pointer, improving performance and code size. These paired loads and stores execute as a single operation on the Apple M1, which, as far as I know, isn’t possible on x86 CPUs, giving Rosetta 2 an advantage here.</p>



<h2>Appendix: Research Method</h2>



<p>This exploration was based on the methods and information described in Koh M. Nakagawa’s excellent <a href="https://ffri.github.io/ProjectChampollion/">Project Champollion</a>.</p>



<p>To see ahead-of-time translated Rosetta code, I believe I had to disable SIP, compile a new x86 binary, give it a unique name, run it, and then run <strong>otool -tv /var/db/oah/*/*/unique-name.aot</strong> (or use your tool of choice – it’s just a Mach-O binary). This was done on an old version of macOS, so things may have changed and improved since then.</p>



<h2>Update: Appendix: Compatibility</h2>



<p>Although it has nothing to do with why Rosetta 2 is fast, there are a couple of impressive compatibility features that seem worth mentioning.</p>



<p>Rosetta 2 has a full, slow, software implementation of x87’s 80-bit floating point numbers. This allows software that uses those instructions to run correctly. Windows on Arm approaches this by using 64-bit float operations, which generally works, but the decreased precision cause problems on in rare cases. Most software either doesn’t use x87, or was designed to run on older hardware, so even though this emulation is slow, the performance typically works out.</p>



<p>[<em>Update: </em>An earlier version of this post stated that I didn’t believe Windows on Arm handled x87. Thanks to kode54 for correcting this in a comment.]</p>



<p>Rosetta 2 also apparently supports the full 32-bit instruction set for Wine. Support for native 32-bit macOS applications was dropped prior to the launch of Apple Silicon, but support for the 32-bit x86 instruction set allegedly lives on. (I haven’t investigated this myself.)</p>

            information.
        </p>
        <p>One of the Erlang ecosystem’s spiciest nerd snipes are hot code updates. Because it can do it. In ways that almost no other runtime can.</p>
<p>I use Elixir which builds on Erlang and has the same capabilities.</p>
<p>The standard way of doing Elixir releases via <code>mix release</code> does not support Erlang hot code updates. As in, it will not generate the necessary files for you. And if you do want to do it there are several blog posts you need to stitch together or you need to use the Erlang docs in great detail. Learn You Some Erlang has <a href="https://learnyousomeerlang.com/relups">documented much of it</a> of course. AppSignal also has a neat guide on <a href="https://blog.appsignal.com/2021/07/27/a-guide-to-hot-code-reloading-in-elixir.html">hot code reloading in Elixir</a>.</p>
<p>Bryan Hunter and Chris Keathley are both people I listen when they speak because it tends to be interesting, challenging and something I just might not have heard before. Both have described hot code updates as something that people should learn and use. I imagine Whatsapp’s initial engineering crew would agree. They did pretty well.</p>
<p>Of course we do use it. But mostly for trivial things.</p>
<p>Anyone using IEx <code>r MyModule</code> or <code>recompile</code> are doing hot code updates. But reloading a module in development on you local machine doesn’t feel all that spicy. It is cool and useful but feels like an incremental compile or watcher/builder type of thing.</p>
<p>I use it constantly <a href="https://underjord.io/unpacking-elixir-iot-embedded-nerves.html">with Nerves</a>. When developing on an embedded Elixir device and needing to tune some numbers, or reworking a module, pasting into the IEx is faster than uploading new firmware and waiting for the reboot. I stop and start parts of the applications or just terminate the relevant GenServer if I need a state reset.</p>
<p>I’ve also used it for remote devices over <a href="https://github.com/nerves-hub/nerves_hub_web">NervesHub</a>’s built in web console that offers an IEx prompt. When debugging a misbehaving Real Time Clock it was pretty nice to just paste chunks of utility functions and relevant I2C-calls over to the device to get clear answers about what it was doing.</p>
<p>I’d love to see more tooling for the full-blown delivery of hot code updates on top of Elixir’s <code>mix release</code> tooling. Or in the vein of the predecessor <code>distillery</code>. I don’t think there are any shortcuts for doing a correct hot code update. Much like database migrations they require care. And you’ll need to know how you dependencies react to hot code updates and many other interesting topics.</p>
<p>This was just a quick one in case people are curious how Erlang’s hot code updates are actually used, day-to-day, in Elixir.</p>

The last two weeks have been quite literally a car wreck.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>First, the Sunday before the US elections, while pulling over for a paramedic, I got rear-ended by a monster pickup truck. I am fine, thankfully, but my car still is not.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Second, I really believed that the company I work for, the New York Times, would avoid the ULP strike by the tech workers by agreeing to a fair contract before the US elections. That did not happen. And I don't want to discuss the US election results because that hurt will not go away anytime soon. Meanwhile, my colleagues and I went on an 8-day ULP strike. Since the company refused to bargain with us while we were on strike, we decided to end the strike and return to work earlier this week. We would like to get the contract we deserve soon.</p></li><li><p>I am trying very hard to return back to functioning, I must be succeeding because here I am, able to write some words!&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p><strong>Estimates - Is it an Art or Science?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>My car has been in the auto body repair shop for the past two weeks, and I am still trying to get an estimate of its damages. I am learning that it's an interesting domain:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>First, the insurance adjuster submits what they think is the damage to the car to the repair shop. Let's say this is $15000</p></li><li><p>Next, the repair shop submits what they think is the damage back to the insurance company. Let's say it's $18000, and the shop estimates it would take 30 days to fix it.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Eventually, the insurance adjuster and the repair shop expert meet to assess the damage together. Let's say the insurance adjuster approves this new estimate from the repair shop. The repair shop then starts with the repair process. At least this is my understanding so far.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p><strong>Unforeseen Issues</strong></p><p>But what if there is damage that can't be seen yet? Let's say the repair shop is in the process of doing the repairs they notice additional damage. Or they put the car on the frame machine to see if there is damage to the frame. In a unibody frame, it's not just the point of impact of the frame; some of the effects can also transfer to the back of the frame. So they'll have to inspect it to assess the full damage. They might start unassembling the car and notice more damage that was not originally on the estimate. Now what?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Emergent Solutions&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Let's say, based on the new findings, it's going to cost an additional $20,000. They now need the approval of the insurance company to proceed. So they write up the new findings with the new cost and send a supplemental repair for approval. The insurance company will determine whether, at this point, it still makes sense to proceed with the repair or call it a total loss. And, of course, there are guidelines and rules to determine that. Let's assume it's not a total loss. The insurance company then approves the additional cost of repair.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Real Talk or Crazy Talk?</strong></p><p>Can you imagine if the insurance company started arguing with the repair shop, asking them—no—telling them that they would only pay the $18,000 and not the additional $20,000 because that was the original estimate? Does that sound ridiculous to you? It does to me, too. Thank heavens, reality does not operate like this.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Isn't Complex Software Architecture Modernization the same?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>When you are in the process of modernizing legacy software, you are in the realm of complex software. When you look at it from the outside, you see some obvious things, and based on experience and expertise, you come up with an initial estimate. This is the repair shop's original estimate of $18,000</p><p>As you are in the process, you start uncovering additional complexity. This complexity could be similar to some hidden damages the repair shop discovered after un-assembling the parts, or this could be significant frame damage that the repair shop discovered. What do you do? You need additional approvals to proceed at this point.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Good Leaders Ask the Right Questions</strong></p><p>The right questions are asked if you are in a healthy software development environment when you bubble these problems up. How complex is this problem? What are the different ways of solving this? What are the tradeoffs? Are there workarounds or alternate solutions to this?&nbsp;</p><p>Suppose the questions start leading to how you did not see this complexity, how you missed this, why it is taking so long, and you are beholden to the original estimated dates? May the force be with you and your team to give you the strength to see this through. Hopefully, your modernization journey will be a short and successful one.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>To Proceed or call it a Total Loss?</strong></p><p>I have been involved in both types of modernization projects. Cases where the supplemental cost gets approved, and work proceeds until the next step,&nbsp; rinse and repeat until the project has come to completion. I've also seen total loss, i.e.&nbsp; the project got canned because it was too expensive to proceed, and it would cost more than it was worth. It's not easy deciding this, and there are frameworks and decision workshops to try and choose the direction.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Is this a complex context or a complicated context?</strong></p><p><span>I urge you to read the excellent article from David J Snowden and Mary E Boone on,</span><a href="https://hbr.org/2007/11/a-leaders-framework-for-decision-making" rel=""> “A Leaders Framework for Decision Making”</a><span>. Using the Cynefin framework, motorcycle maintenance or auto repair might fall under the complicated context. In order to fix the car, the expert technician, after having listened to how the collision happened, also has to analyze and test multiple factors, such as unseen damage, frame damage, etc., to determine the best course of action for the car.&nbsp;</span></p><p>However, in a complex context, you can only decide whether or not it is right or wrong in hindsight, i.e. after you've tried the thing. Does this jive more and more with complex legacy modernization software projects? I.e. you try something and learn that the integration you thought would work doesn’t work or you uncover a completely new behavior you never knew existed and you now have to account for it?&nbsp; </p><p>There is no fixed path when modernizing a complex legacy system. There is no rulebook to follow. You try, experiment, discover, solve, and move on to the next piece until you're done.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Denial - Anger - Bargaining - Depression - Acceptance??</strong></p><p>When modernizing applications, if we understand that this effort falls somewhere between Complex and Complicated Contexts, we can implement the right sort of gauges to see how to proceed and determine success. Applying the process of estimates for a complex context is wrong. It’s like trying to use a hammer as a solution for every screw or a lug nut!&nbsp;Sometimes you need a screwdriver and sometimes you need a wrench!</p><p>Curveballs in modernization projects are just a reality. You can't foresee every outcome ahead of time. No amount of upfront analysis would lead you to a perfect data model. There will be new learnings almost every step of the way. Data Models will have to change based on the complexity you have uncovered. So it's a matter of when, not if, for curveballs. When a curveball hits and the estimate changes, take a step forward instead of getting angry or blaming folks or trying to do a what-if analysis on how best to bring the schedule in. </p><p><span>When you’re dealing with curveballs, which </span><a href="https://continuousdelivery.com/implementing/culture/" rel="">Ron Westrum’s defined model of culture</a><span> does your organization adopt? Power-Oriented where messengers who inform about the curveballs are shot and failure leads to&nbsp; scapegoated, Rule-Oriented where the messengers who inform about the curveballs are ignored and failure leads to justice or Performance- Oriented where the messengers who inform about the curveballs are trained and failure leads to enquiry?&nbsp;</span></p><p>As long as the problem you're trying to solve is still relevant and still meets the business needs, take it one step at a time. Ultimately the software you are trying to modernize is for users.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Tip for Leaders Leading Modernization Initiatives</strong></p><p><span>To quote from the same </span><a href="https://hbr.org/2007/11/a-leaders-framework-for-decision-making" rel="">article</a><span>, "Leaders who don't recognize that a complex domain requires a more experimental mode of management may become impatient when they don't seem to be achieving the results they were aiming for. They may also find it difficult to tolerate failure, an essential aspect of experimental understanding. If they try to overcontrol the organization, they will preempt the opportunity for informative patterns to emerge. Leaders who try to impose order in a complex context will fail. Still, those who set the stage, step back a bit, allow patterns to emerge, and determine which ones are desirable will succeed".&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>A New Hope</strong></p><p>Either way I will be ok, whether the repair company is able to fix my car or the insurance company deems it a total loss. The system works. I wish I could say the same for modernization projects and the awful industry practice about how much ceremony we attribute to estimates, completely forgetting that an estimate means an approximate of the actual. I hope more and more software companies and leadership use the proper framework for measuring success. I hope this leaves you with some ideas on implementing changes or at least questioning the practices if they seem wrong.&nbsp;</p><p><em>"I've wondered why it took us so long to catch on. We saw it, and yet we didn't see it. Or rather we were trained not to see it. Conned perhaps into thinking that the real action was metropolitan and all this was just boring hinterland. It was a puzzling thing. The truth knocks on the door and you say, "Go away. I'm looking for the truth." And so it goes away. Puzzling."</em></p><p><em>― Robert Pirsig</em></p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The other day I saw the launch of Apple Vision Pro, the whole thing was very interesting, but one thing that caught my attention was the finger input. It seems very intuitive, by using the finger pinching as sort of like a cursor or mouse input. I figured I want to try it out, so I took it upon myself to create it.</p>

<video autoplay="" loop="" width="100%" controls="" muted="" preload="none" poster="https://i.imgur.com/fMaKvGG.jpeg">

</video>

<p><em>Apple Vision Pro input using finger pinching action</em></p>

<h2 id="game-plan">Game Plan</h2>

<p>The goal here is to use the hand as an input device for computer. It should be able to handle clicking and moving the mouse cursor. In order to do this, we obviously need a camera, and for starter, let’s point the camera to face downwards, since that is basically where the hands will be when using a computer. Next we need some sort of way to detect the hand and fingers position for controlling the mouse. For this, I will be using <a href="https://developers.google.com/mediapipe" target="_blank">MediaPipe</a> from Google. The best way I can describe MediaPipe is, a set of prebuilt solutions for ML, and it happens to have a hand landmarker feature, which is what we needed. Lastly we will need to somehow simulate the mouse input.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/P19M4Ha.jpeg" alt="MediaPipe hand landmark detection"></p>

<p><em>MediaPipe hand landmark detection</em></p>

<p><em>High level design of the system</em></p>

<h2 id="first-trial">First Trial</h2>

<p>Starting with this, we can use the python version of MediaPipe, and have <a href="https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/dd/d43/tutorial_py_video_display.html" target="_blank">OpenCV</a> read the camera feed and input it to MediaPipe, then utilize the hand landmarks to simulate the mouse, simple right? Except that this doesn’t work very well. I’ve only got into the OpenCV with MediaPipe and I found that it is super laggy.</p>

<video autoplay="" loop="" width="100%" controls="" muted="" preload="none" poster="https://i.imgur.com/NXoHagh.jpeg">
  <source src="https://i.imgur.com/NXoHagh.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

<p><em>Python version is super laggy, something to do with OpenCV</em></p>

<p>After some researching, turns out it was because it has something to do with the OpenCV, related to how the <code>waitKey</code> function works. I still haven’t found out the fix yet, so I suppose we’re skipping python altogether to save time and sanity.</p>

<h2 id="a-stupid-idea">A Stupid Idea</h2>

<p>During research for using MediaPipe, I found out about the web version of the library through its demo. And for some reason the web version ran very smoothly. I figured I can use the web version instead of the python version. Just one problem though, how would I control the mouse using a browser? So, I came up with a crazy idea, since I can run the MediaPipe locally, what if I have a python backend running to simulate the mouse? I just have to figure out how to communicate the MediaPipe frontend to the Python backend.</p>

<video autoplay="" loop="" width="100%" controls="" muted="" preload="none" poster="https://i.imgur.com/8pZJXVD.jpeg">
  <source src="https://i.imgur.com/8pZJXVD.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

<p><em>Web version running smoothly</em></p>

<h2 id="simulating-the-mouse">Simulating the Mouse</h2>

<p>For the MediaPipe frontend to communicate with the Python backend, I need to have it work through some sort of method. I thought of 3 ways, which are simple HTTP request, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API">WebSocket</a>, and <a href="https://grpc.io/" target="_blank">gRPC</a> with streaming. The HTTP request is immediately out of the picture, considering I need the latency to be as low as possible. This left me with 2 options that are both for streaming data. I decided to use WebSocket because it allows for realtime communication between the client and the server, which is needed for our use case, plus I’m not too familiar with gRPC.</p>

<p>I setup a simple WebSocket server in python which will accept a JSON string message containing the x and y coordinate to move the mouse to. I then just have to connect the coordinates of one of the finger to be sent to the backend, in this case I’ll be using the thumb tip.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/IVFKzqI.jpeg" alt="WebSocket server receiving information to control the mouse"></p>

<p><em>WebSocket server receiving information to control the mouse</em></p>

  <source src="https://i.imgur.com/9P2Yo0J.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

<p><em>Using a web browser to control the mouse</em></p>

<p>And it worked! Surprisingly very well even, however it feels very wrong though, controlling it using the browser. In any case, the latency is not that noticeable, I suppose there might be some inefficiency. But for now let’s just ignore that.</p>

<p>Next is the clicking logic. To detect a click, we need to detect a pinch action, between the thumb and index finger. To do this, we just have to measure the distance between the thumb tip and index finger tip, this is using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance" target="_blank">Euclidean distance</a>. If it is less than a certain threshold, we will invoke a mouse down event, and if it is greater than the threshold, we will invoke the mouse up event. Notice that we are using mouse down and up instead of click, this is to support dragging action.</p>

<p>This solution works fine, however, there is a problem if we were to move the hand closer to the camera. Since we are moving a 3D object in 2D space, by moving the hand closer to the camera, the distance between the finger tips also gets larger.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/qAnCM7Q.jpeg" alt="Distance between finger tip, far vs close to the camera"></p>

<p><em>Distance between finger tip, far vs close to the camera</em></p>

<p>To solve this issue, we can implement a workaround to use a relative distance instead. By calculating the distance between the finger tips and the respective knuckles, where the distance will get larger the closer the hand is to the camera, we can compare this distance to the distance between the tip. This way we get a proper finger tips distance regardless if the hand is closer or far away from the camera.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/6hwT1b9.jpeg" alt="Calculating relative distance between finger tips"></p>

<p><em>Calculating relative distance between finger tips</em></p>

<h2 id="the-jitter">The Jitter</h2>

<p>Next problem to solve is the jitter. Notice that even when my hand is not moving, and rested on the table, the cursor is still shaking. This is inherently caused by the hand landmarker model, and the only way to really fix this is to use a better model. However not all hopes are lost. For now, we can implement a simple moving average for the cursor position, this way it doesn’t jitter so much, and the movement become smooth. The only thing is, the higher the buffer for the moving average, the higher the latency as well. While we are at this, I added buffer to the pinch state as well, because it usually does a false negative while doing pinching and moving at the same time.</p>

</video>

<p><em>Movement is much smoother with moving average</em></p>

<p>Another improvement we can add is a safe zone for edges of the screen. As it is now, the cursor position is based on the thumb tip coordinates. Due to this, to reach the edge of the screen we need to put the hand all the way to the edge, and in doing so, the hand is no longer fully visible. To solve this, we can implement a simple linear transformation to convert the coordinates. For this, I am basically adding a padding on each side of the edges. This way we can solve the problem of the hand not being fully visible.</p>

<p><em>Before and after padding illustration</em></p>

<h2 id="a-better-idea">A Better idea</h2>

<p>Let’s go back to the latency inefficiency thing I mentioned earlier. Not only am I facing this issue, but also the fact that I need to have the tab always open for the cursor to function. We want to maintain using the web version of MediaPipe and also have it running even when the tab is not active. After some researching, one suitable option is to use <a href="https://tauri.app/">Tauri</a>, a framework for building desktop apps using web technology and Rust, because it can run the web frontend as a standalone program and the Rust backend can be used to communicate with the frontend much more efficiently. This can be used to simulate the mouse input we had in python. I just have to adjust some of my code. Not knowing any Rust, I did use Google and ChatGPT for implementing this.</p>

<p>Putting it all together, here is the result.</p>

<p><em>Using hand tracking to simulate mouse input</em></p>

<h2 id="developing-another-mode">Developing another mode</h2>

<p>At this point, the project should’ve been finished, but I took some time to watch YouTube video related to hand tracking input. I found that Meta Quest has a hand gesture input, which is equally cool. If in the Apple Vision Pro, you need to have the eye tracking sensor to know where the cursor is pointed, in the Meta Quest, you just have to point your hand or finger to the “screen”. I figured, why not also add this mode so the camera can face forward, and user just have to point their finger towards the screen.</p>

<video autoplay="" loop="" width="100%" controls="" muted="" preload="none" poster="https://i.imgur.com/BoBUSZA.jpeg">
  <source src="https://i.imgur.com/BoBUSZA.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

<p><em>Meta Quest hand tracking feature. credit: “Tricks Tips Fix” on Youtube</em></p>

<p>In order to determine where the finger is pointing, we can’t only use where it is located in the x and y coordinates like we did for the down facing mode. Instead, first we need to know what angle is the finger pointing at. Second, we also need to know the Z distance between the camera and the finger, these values will be used for calculating where the cursor will “land” on the screen basically.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/2VuVSZe.jpeg" alt="Illustration on determining where the cursor will land on the screen"></p>

<p><em>Illustration on determining where the cursor will land on the screen</em></p>

<p>For the angle, we can simply pick 2 points from the hand landmark, and by using some trigonometry we can determine the angle. We do this for the YZ angle and XZ angle to have both the horizontal and vertical angle. For the distance, this is quite tricky, because the Z axis in the hand landmark does not mean how far it is from the screen, it is just the Z distance between the finger point and the wrist point. So in order to determine distance, we will have to play around with the scale. Remember earlier where I mentioned about distance between finger points is larger when hand is closer to the screen, and smaller when the hand is further from the screen. I’m basically using this information to calculate the distance from the camera to the hand.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/GxyTr84.jpeg" alt="Example for Y axis, using the angle of the finger, along with the distance to screen, we can find the cursor Y value"></p>

<p><em>Example for Y axis, using the angle of the finger, along with the distance to screen, we can find the cursor Y value</em></p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/BwT0mAR.jpeg" alt="The Formula"></p>

<p><em>The Formula</em></p>

<p>Testing the front facing mode, I am experiencing more shaking than the down facing mode. Even with the moving average, the shaking is still unbearable. So I seek a better alternative to this method, and found the <a href="https://gery.casiez.net/1euro/" target="_blank">One Euro Filter</a>. It is a type of low pass filter, which basically does smoothing for noisy input, that is our cursor. I did have to tweak some parameter to make it usable as we are adjusting for lower jittering but also reasonable latency. In addition to that, I added some thresholding for the angle in order to further reduce the jittering. And it is somewhat usable now! I also ended up changing the moving average into One Euro Filter for the down facing mode for better latency.</p>

</video>

<p><em>After adding One Euro Filter and thresholding, the mouse movement is relatively tame, but still jittery</em></p>

<p>In the end, however, it is not all sunshine and roses, as there are some major problems for the front facing mode. The first biggest one is the shaking input. At certain position and angle, for some reason the MediaPipe readings will be very shaky, rendering all the filter and smoothing useless. The second one is when pinching the fingers together, there is a slight drift, making it hard to click something as the cursor just drifts away. These issues are inherently present within the model, and I figured no amount of smoothing and filtering can fix this besides fixing the actual model.</p>

<p><em>Mouse is drifting when fingers are pinched</em></p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In this project, I did what I set out to make, which is to create a cursor or mouse input like the one from the Apple Vision Pro, plus the Meta Quest headset. I had fun working on this project as I get to try some cool tech like MediaPipe, Tauri, Rust and doing some maths for this to work. You can find the project in the repository below. I’ve only tested this on Windows, it may or may not work on Linux or MacOS.</p>

<p>Here are some video demos for the final result.</p>

<p><em>Interacting with the front facing mode</em></p>

<p>All in all, I would say the down facing mode works quite reliably, while the front facing mode is still unstable given the issues I mentioned.</p>

<p>Some notes</p>

<ul>
  <li>To minimize some of the drift when pinching, resting the thumb on the side of the middle finger tip can help.</li>
  <li>For the angle calculation in front facing mode, especially vertical angle, I added an offset, due to the camera being placed at the top of the screen, this is to correct the cursor being lower than where the finger is pointing.</li>
  <li>I have yet to find a way to make the Tauri app work in background, so minimizing the window will stop the cursor. So, to change window, just click the desired window without minimizing the Tauri window.</li>
</ul>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

					<p>Shift left is evolving from a buzzword into a much broader shift in design methodology and EDA tooling, and while it’s still early innings there is widespread agreement that it will be transformative.</p>
<p>The semiconductor industry has gone through many changes over the past few decades. Some are obvious, but others happen because of a convergence of multiple factors that require systemic change in the process itself, which is the case today. On the surface, <a href="https://semiengineering.com/knowledge_centers/eda-design/methodologies-and-flows/shift-left/">shift left</a> may look like a minor change involving optimization strategies, or the introduction of new metrics, but this is a fundamental move from an insular semiconductor perspective to the start of the systems’ age of design. What is perhaps even more surprising is that the push for change is coming from all sides of the existing flow.</p>
<p>This is not the first time the industry has faced such challenges. “Shame on us if the institutional fog of war has caused us to forget those lessons,” says Rob Knoth, group director for strategy and new ventures at <a href="https://semiengineering.com/entities/cadence-design-systems/">Cadence</a>. “We have experienced this multiple times. We have been faced with a scope that is broader than the tools we have, based on physics or phenomena, or that aren’t perfectly captured by the tool you have. We have faced deadlines that are too aggressive to be able to do a perfect job. People who have succeeded in those epics are the ones who are honest about what can they simulate, what can they estimate, and how it will impact the people up and downstream of them.”</p>
<p>The change encompasses many areas, some of which are itemized below:</p>
<p><strong>Change in optimization focus</strong>: Optimization strategies have shifted from simple power, performance, and area (PPA) metrics to system-level metrics, such as performance per watt. “If you go back into the 1990s, 2000s, the road map was very clear,” says Chris Auth, director of advanced technology programs at Intel Foundry. “Just make things smaller, make things faster, make things cheaper. We are seeing that spread out into a variety of different avenues. PPA optimization is just one thing you do, but there are lots of other things including thermal or frequency per watt that you now optimize for. I don’t think the story is fully written on how to do that.”</p>
<p><strong>3D-ICs</strong>: Chiplets are more than just fabricated pieces of IP. They are changing many aspects of the development flow. “3D-IC is changing the market and industry,” says HeeSoo Lee, segment lead for high-speed design at <a href="https://semiengineering.com/entities/keysight-technologies/">Keysight</a>. “PPA now involves multiple disciplines. You are not vertically structured any longer. You are incorporating a lot of different blocks into a system design. How do you optimize that from a system perspective? What are the languages you are going to use to talk to those different die or different functional blocks? It places interesting market demands for chiplets, or heterogeneous integration, for the system level. We need to optimize system performance by utilizing different die, and then optimize the entire package performance.”</p>
<p>How those die are arranged, assembled, validated, and tested remains a significant challenge, however, and some of that work can be done ahead of time through pre-assembled, pre-integrated chiplets. “The workload and software is where differentiation is happening,” said Christopher Rumpf, senior director of automotive at <a href="https://semiengineering.com/entities/arm/">Arm</a>. “So we will still sell IP products, but we are now assembling them into larger subsystems.”</p>
<p><strong>Increased interdependence</strong>: All metrics become connected to each other as we get closer to the limits imposed by physics. “The goal in design closure is to optimize across multiple variables, based on certain conditions or inputs provided by the user,” says Manoj Chacko, senior director of product management at <a href="https://semiengineering.com/entities/synopsys-inc/">Synopsys</a>. “In addition to PPA, there is now R, for reliability or robustness. This started when we had to consider IR voltage drop, which was impacting performance. Techniques to mitigate that were developed. Then we see variability — of the devices, and device behavior changing based on the neighbors and its context — and that is impacting the performance of a design and impacting power.”</p>
<p><strong>Domain-specific design</strong>: Gone are the days of general-purpose design. In many industries, bespoke silicon is the only way to achieve the necessary design characteristics. “You’ve gone from general compute to more workload specific applications,” says Intel’s Auth. “Everybody has a different way that they need to push the technology. PPA is a component, but there’s a lot of things that PPA doesn’t cover.”</p>
<p>This is especially evident in automotive design. “If you think about a car, it’s a real system modeling challenge,” said Jean-Marie Brunet, vice president and general manager for hardware-assisted verification at <a href="https://semiengineering.com/entities/mentor-a-siemens-business/">Siemens EDA</a>. “They have different sampling rates, different clocks, different accuracy of the models. How do those things talk to each other? It’s an industry integration challenge, which is why we have digital twins. They can give you a visual representation of the end device or system. This is an incredible synchronization and integration challenge, and it’s a very heavy compute platform environment. You have to make a decision about which software will work with specific hardware.”</p>
<p><strong>System design</strong>: The system is no longer just the hardware. Ravi Poddar, senior leader and advisor for the semiconductor industry at AWS, noted that Volvo reportedly has about 120 ECUs, 100 million lines of source code, and 3 million functions in 30 million places in that source code.[1]</p>
<p>“We’re seeing a shift left using software and virtual twins,” Poddar said. “This includes virtual hardware in the loop, and it requires you to test early and test often.”</p>
<p>Software is now an integral part of hardware design, but the development schedules often are different for hardware and software. “The software is always missing when doing analysis of the system and the hardware,” says Ahmed Hamza, solution architect for the cybertronic system engineering initiative at Siemens EDA. “You build a system, but if you don’t know what software will run on the system, the whole equation will change. Hardware, system and software are the three pieces that we need to put together early enough in the analysis that it will impact how the future system engineering is done.”</p>
<p>What hasn’t changed is the way we have to approach the problem. “The key thing about optimization is that as you go through the flow, your degrees of freedom decrease,” says Marc&nbsp;Swinnen, director of product marketing at <a href="https://semiengineering.com/entities/ansys/">Ansys</a>. “In the beginning, you have many degrees of freedom, so your potential optimization is much higher. As you go further down the flow, your degrees of freedom reduce. The potential goes down.”</p>
<p>Engineers like to divide and conquer. “We cannot do everything at the same time,” says Keysight’s Lee. “We know the order in which things need to be worked out. Of course, not everything is equally critical for every single application or use case. Some designs are more focused on the system performance while others are more focused on power. Every engineer or system architect has their own charter to go in and optimize. We are entering a new era where it’s not completely stabilized or mature.”</p>
<p><strong>Holistic Optimization</strong><br>
What is achievable at any given step in the development flow is limited by predictive uncertainty. “When you make a change in your design, let’s say power, there is the signal, but there is also noise, which means there is uncertainty,” says Ansys’ Swinnen. “The actual power could be a bit higher or lower, because you don’t have the wires, you don’t perform the exact synthesis. There’s a noise level in your information and given the amount of uncertainty you have at a given stage you can only optimize down to the noise level. Beyond that, any information could be spurious. You are wasting your time, you’re just randomly generating numbers, but have no idea if it’s really lower or higher. You’re limited by that noise band, and once you hit the noise band, it’s time to move on to the next step, because there’s no more optimization that makes sense at this step, even relative.”</p>
<p>Where to start an analysis is highly dependent on optimization goals. “What you need is a good software solution that can simulate the entire system that you’re going to have,” says Auth. “Then you can optimize each of the components. You end up with a lot of very customized software that simulates a variety of these things. It simulates thermals, it simulates frequency or something like that. There’s a big opportunity for software that can give you a better answer to the designer as to the best way to optimize the technology.”</p>
<p>But it’s essential understand the accuracy of the models or information being used. “A simple way to describe it is ‘garbage in, garbage out,'” says Lee. “How good is the model that represents each of the die in a heterogeneous integration? If your model is not accurate enough, and you’re building optimization on top of it, then you are optimizing based on garbage. While simulation technologies are super powerful, they need to address all the ingredients in the right way so that accuracy is preserved. If you don’t have those technologies and models, then you’re going to develop something based on the wrong input data.”</p>
<p>In the past, the industry has developed abstractions that help preserve necessary accuracy while reducing computation time. “At the front end, you don’t have metrics,” says Swinnen. “You use proxies. For example, power density is a good proxy for thermal. For timing at the RT level, you use a wire-load model based on fan-out. As you go into placement, you use Manhattan distance. Then as you go to routing, it’s net length. The router is not actually looking at timing. The placer is not looking at timing. Each step has its proxy, which gets better and better, and it’s only when the routing is done that you finally have an RC model. That’s not a proxy anymore. Now you have the actual simulatable delay of the wire.”</p>
<p>This means you must constantly assess what is possible both in terms of accuracy and affordable compute power. “What help do you need to improve the accuracy of your process? You may need some creativity to try strategies that didn’t work in the past,” says Cadence’s Knoth. “Maybe you didn’t have the compute horsepower to do all the simulations you needed, and today you might. When we’re talking about PPA optimization strategies, and most recently we saw this with power, you didn’t have enough horsepower to integrate vectors into the design optimization phase. Well now the algorithms are better, the estimation techniques are more accurate, the simulation horsepower is better. You can start integrating some data that in the past you just estimated, and now you can actually measure it.”</p>
<p>Better estimates allow for more optimization and automation. “Designing a network on chip (NoC) requires analysis based on physical design,” says Andy Nightingale, vice president of product management and marketing at <a href="https://semiengineering.com/entities/arterisip/">Arteris</a>. “When you control aspects of the physical placement, coupled with many analysis tools, we can build an explorer tool that lets you run traffic profiles. You can push tons of transactions to any part of the network, and you can see how it performs in a worst-case scenario in terms of the quality of service scheme, the width of the interfaces, and other parameters. You’ve got a good idea of wire length in the design, you’ve got a good idea of what the placement is going to look like, you’ve got a good idea of what the latency and bandwidths are going to look like across the network. All those things combine to give a really good starting point to the next stage in the process.”</p>
<p>The system level is where you have greatest degrees of freedom. “The majority of the power and performance optimization — something like 70% to 80% — is decided during the earliest part of the design phase with architectural decisions,” says Ninad Huilgol, founder and CEO of Innergy Systems. “Architects typically have some way of performing what-if simulations to decide the optimum architecture. Increasingly, this area is being helped by advanced power modeling that can perform virtual simulations to estimate power and performance.”</p>
<p>Without the necessary estimation tools, there are limits to what can be achieved. “The thing about predictive uncertainty is that there are two ways to go about it,” says Swinnen. “You guard-band, or you invest more in measuring it. Guard-banding is the easy way. You just make very big margins, but that increases the noise band and limits your ability to optimize. In some cases, this is not immediately obvious. Guard-banding limits the amount of early optimization you can do and forces you to optimize further down the pike.”</p>
<p>Chiplets are one area where this may be happening. “If you talk about backside power, or stacking chips, it’s not sufficient just to think about one chip’s thermals,” says Auth. “You also have to consider its impact on the chips next to it. You have to know how the system is going to exercise it. Previously, we focused on optimizing one die or one chiplet, but when it’s in a bigger package with multiple chiplets, the optimization of one die is a little bit less important than the optimization for the overall package that you’re going to end up with.”</p>
<p>This can create difficulties if the development is not completely top down. “Optimizing system and module metrics is a complementary and evolutionary process,” says Kinjal Dave, senior director of product management in Arm’s Client Line of Business. “While we are increasingly seeing more time and resources being spent on the system level, module metrics are crucial during development phases when a complete system has not yet been established. In the early stages of development, you often can’t construct a full system because not all functionalities are finalized. Hence, you continue analyzing those module metrics and gradually incorporate more system-level metrics later in the development process.”</p>
<p>The industry has work to do before some of this becomes possible. “Hardware teams and EDA tools spend a lot of time performing analysis, but unfortunately this information does not have a path back to the system engineer,” says Siemens’ Hamza. “At the beginning of the analysis, they need some metrics. They need to understand what’s going on. There is immediate information that system engineer can benefit from. What if we could make it available in a language and a form that they can read and understand? That would change the whole concept of system engineering.”</p>
<p>The lack of information means you have no choice but to use guard-bands. “As you shift left, you’re not going to have complete knowledge,” says Auth. “You’re going to put some guard rails up. And you are planning that when you get more knowledge in the future, you’ll be able to alleviate some of that guard banding and get more performance in the future.”</p>
<p>Shift left is attempting to move an increasing amount of information forward, but it needs to move out from the existing hardware focus into software and systems as well. “You need to ask the what-if questions at the top level versus the bottom level,” says Arteris’ Nightingale. “You make an untimed model of your design and drop the software onto it, so you get an idea of what the software is going to be demanding of the system. Then you refine that down from that top-level view to say what hardware components are required. You’ll never converge if you say, I’m going to start with X type of processor, and Y type of system fabric and try and end up with a result. You have to start with the end application in mind, and then work down from that.”</p>
<p>To solve the problem, everyone has to come to the same table. “The semiconductor industry has achieved the scale that we have because we’ve accepted a certain number of rules,” says Knoth. “To do that, we haven’t always done everything that the process is capable of. If you go outside the silicon and you go to the package world, you go to the PCB world, you go to the mechanical world, there is much less rigidity. We’re going to see some flow outwards of more standardization. And we’re already seeing this at the chiplet level, with more standards getting put in place.”</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
While shift left is gaining a lot of attention, there is a broader transformation underway. It involves players that were never included in the past, and they often talk different languages and have their own methodologies in place. In many cases the changes that need to be made are not just technical. They also impact the organization’s structure. New tools and methodologies have to produce good results based on the level of investment they require, both from the EDA perspective and the design houses, and they need to keep in mind the long-term direction and goals.</p>
<p>This is not going to be solved in a year or two. It requires rebuilding of the entire flow, which ultimately will bring systems engineering and semiconductor development under a single umbrella.</p>

<p dir="auto">Integrate is a small, lightweight Rust library for performing numerical integration of real-valued functions. It is designed to integrate functions, providing a simple and efficient way to approximate definite integrals using various numerical methods.</p>
<p dir="auto">Numerical integration is concerned with developing algorithms to
approximate the integral of a function <math-renderer data-static-url="https://github.githubassets.com/static" data-run-id="eb5df0eb922c2c83a02b68fbf058e889">$f(x)$</math-renderer>. The most commonly used algorithms
are Newton-Cotes formulas, Romberg's method, Gaussian quadrature, and to
lesser extents Hermite's formulas and certain adaptive techniques.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Features</h2><a id="user-content-features" aria-label="Permalink: Features" href="#features"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Integrate supports a variety of numerical integration techniques:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Newton-Cotes methods:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Rectangle Rule.</li>
<li>Trapezoidal Rule.</li>
<li>Simpson's Rule.</li>
<li>Newton's 3/8 Rule.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Gauss quadrature methods:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Gauss-Legendre.</li>
<li>Gauss-Laguerre.</li>
<li>Gauss-Hermite.</li>
<li>Gauss-Chebyshev First Kind.</li>
<li>Gauss-Chebyshev Second Kind.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Adaptive Methods:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Adaptive Simpson's method</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Romberg’s method.</p>

</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Caveats</h2><a id="user-content-caveats" aria-label="Permalink: Caveats" href="#caveats"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">All of the numerical integration techniques listed above assume that
the integrand is continuous on the interval of integration. The error
estimates generally require that the integrands are differentiable of
whatever order is required so that the formula for the error estimate
makes sense. Below is a check list which one should verify before using
any of the numerical algorithms.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Integrand check list</h3><a id="user-content-integrand-check-list" aria-label="Permalink: Integrand check list" href="#integrand-check-list"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Are there any singularities of the integrand in the interval of integration?</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">If there are, then can they be removed?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">A function which has jump discontinuities can be integrated by splitting
the interval of integration into subintervals on which the function is continuous,
and then numerically integrate over each subinterval and add the results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Using integration by parts certain types of singular integrals can be
expressed as the sum of a function and a non-singular integral.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">In other cases, an approximation of the integral in a small neighborhood of
the singularity can be obtained by hand and the interval of integration can be
split into three intervals in which numerical integration can be used on
two of them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Does the function oscillate over the region of integration? If it does,
then make sure that the step size is chosen to be smaller than the wave length
of the function. The interval of integration can also be split into subintervals
in which each subinterval is half a wave length and the algorithm is applied
to each subinterval.</p>
