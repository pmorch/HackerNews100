				<h4><i></i>Overview of the <span>iLeakage Attack.</span></h4>
				<div>
					<p>
						<!-- After first sentence, emphasize how Spectre is still alive and kicking nearly 6 years after release -->
						We present iLeakage, a transient execution side channel targeting the <a href="https://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari web browser</a> present on Macs, iPads and
						iPhones. iLeakage shows that the <a href="https://spectreattack.com/">Spectre</a> attack is still
						relevant and exploitable, even after nearly 6 years of effort to mitigate it since its discovery.
						We show how an attacker can induce Safari to render an arbitrary webpage, subsequently
						recovering sensitive information present within it using speculative execution. In particular,
						we demonstrate how Safari allows a malicious webpage to recover secrets from popular high-value
						targets, such as Gmail inbox content. Finally, we demonstrate the recovery of passwords, in case
						these are autofilled by credential managers.

							<p>
								Yes (with a very high chance), if you have a device running macOS or iOS with Apple's
								A-series or M-series CPUs. This includes all recent iPhones and iPads, as well as
								Apple's laptops and desktops from 2020 and onwards.

					<div id="panelsStayOpen-collapseImpact" aria-labelledby="panelsStayOpen-headingImpact">
							<p>
								Code running in one web browser tab should be isolated and not be able to infer anything
								about other tabs that a user has open. However, with iLeakage, malicious JavaScript and
								WebAssembly can read the content of a target webpage when a target visits and clicks on
								an attacker's webpage. This content includes personal information, passwords, or credit
								card information.
							</p>
						</div>
					<div id="panelsStayOpen-collapseMitigation" aria-labelledby="panelsStayOpen-headingMitigation">
								<p>
									At the time of public release, Apple has implemented a mitigation for iLeakage
									in Safari. However, this mitigation is not enabled by default, and enabling it
									is possible only on macOS. Furthermore, it is marked as unstable.
									We will keep this FAQ updated as Apple pushes more iOS and macOS updates.
									If you wish to enable the mitigation on your Mac now, below are the steps:
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>If you have updated to macOS Sonoma:</b>
								</p>
								<ol>
									<li>Open the Terminal app. You can find this in the Launchpad, or through Spotlight
										search.</li>
									<li>Copy and paste the following command (in magenta), and press the Return key to
										run it:
										<br><code>defaults write com.apple.Safari IncludeInternalDebugMenu 1</code>.
									</li>
								</ol>
								<p>
									<b>If you are on an earlier macOS version (macOS Ventura and earlier):</b>
								</p>
								<ol>
									<li>We recommend enabling automatic updates and updating to macOS Sonoma. However,
										if you wish to enable the mitigation on older macOS versions, follow these
										steps:</li>
									<li>First, download the version of Safari Technology Preview tht matches your macOS
										version from Apple's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/resources/">download page.</a></li>
									<li>Double-click the downloaded installer with the <code>.pkg</code> file extension,
										and follow its directions until Safari Technology Preview is installed.</li>
									<li>Open the Terminal app. You can find this in the Launchpad, or through Spotlight
										search.</li>
									<li>Copy and paste the following command (in magenta), and press the Return key to
										run it:
										<br><code>defaults write com.apple.SafariTechnologyPreview IncludeInternalDebugMenu 1</code>.
									</li>
								</ol>
								<p>
									<b>This enables Safari's hidden debugging menu. Then, follow these steps:</b>
								</p>
								<ol>
									<li>Open Safari (or Safari Technology Preview). On the menu bar, you should see a
										new entry named <b>Debug</b>. <br><img src="https://ileakage.com/img/debug-menu.png" alt="Hidden debug menu"></li>
									<li>Click the Debug menu. This opens a long dropdown. Click on <b>WebKit Internal
											Features</b>. <br><img src="https://ileakage.com/img/webkit-internal.png" alt="WebKit internal features"></li>
									<li>This opens another long dropdown to the side. Scroll down to the bottom of this
										new dropdown, where you'll find an entry called <b>Swap Processes on Cross-Site
											Window Open</b>. <br><img src="https://ileakage.com/img/pson.png" alt="Swap processes on cross-site window.open">
									</li>
									<li>Click this entry. A checkmark should appear to the left of it, like the
										screenshot below. <br><img src="https://ileakage.com/img/pson-enabled.png" alt="Mitigation enabled"></li>
								</ol>
								<p>
									Afterwards, you're all set! To disable the mitigation, repeat steps 1-4 from above,
									and the checkmark will disappear.
									To disable the hidden debugging menu, open the Terminal app, copy and paste the
									following command (depending on your OS version), and press the Return key to run.
									The changes will apply the next time you start Safari (or Safari Technology
									Preview).
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>For Safari (macOS Sonoma):
										<br><code>defaults write com.apple.Safari IncludeInternalDebugMenu 0</code></li>
									<li>For Safari Technology Preview (macOS Ventura and earlier):
										<br><code>defaults write com.apple.SafariTechnologyPreview IncludeInternalDebugMenu 0</code>
									</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
					<div id="panelsStayOpen-collapseDetect" aria-labelledby="panelsStayOpen-headingDetect">
							<p>
								iLeakage is highly unlikely to be detected, since the attack runs in Safari and does not
								leave traces in the system's log files. However, traces of an attacker webpage hosting
								iLeakage may be present in the browser's cache of pages it has recently visited.
							</p>
						</div>
					<div id="panelsStayOpen-collapseAbuse" aria-labelledby="panelsStayOpen-headingAbuse">
							<p>
								So far, we do not have evidence that iLeakage has been or not been abused. However, we
								note that iLeakage is a significantly difficult attack to orchestrate end-to-end, and
								requires advanced knowledge of browser-based side-channel attacks and Safari's
								implementation.
							</p>
						</div>
					<div id="panelsStayOpen-collapseStopPassword" aria-labelledby="panelsStayOpen-headingStopPassword">
							<p>
								Not for the most part. In fact, we encourage using credential managers as opposed to
								trying to remember all of your passwords. In general, this is a better approach
								than reusing passwords or storing them insecurely. While iLeakage can recover
								credentials that are autofilled into a webpage, we note that many platforms require user
								interaction for autofill to occur.
							</p>
						</div>
					<div id="panelsStayOpen-collapseNotify" aria-labelledby="panelsStayOpen-headingNotify">

								We disclosed our results to Apple on September 12, 2022 (408 days before public release).

					<h5>For Tech-Savvy Readers</h5>
				</p>
				<div id="technical-details">
					<div id="panelsStayOpen-collapseJS" aria-labelledby="panelsStayOpen-headingJS">
							<p>
								JavaScript and WebAssembly are two programming languages that make up the backbone of
								interactive webpages, such as online games and video streaming services. JavaScript can
								update the content of the website directly, while WebAssembly is used for
								high-performance web applications. Ultimately, WebAssembly interfaces with JavaScript to
								deliver dynamic content to users. Since both are sandboxed in a browser environment,
								side-channel attacks are notably more difficult to implement in these languages.
								However, the impact is drastically greater, as browsers execute both types of code
								automatically and do not require the user to download the malicious program.
							</p>
						</div>
					<div id="panelsStayOpen-collapseSidechannel" aria-labelledby="panelsStayOpen-headingSidechannel">
								<p>
									Most computer bugs arise from mistakes in programming, such as missing bounds checks
									or use-after-frees. However, a side-channel attack exploits the implementation of a
									computer system to attack it, even if the program it runs is a secure algorithm.
									Systems can leak sensitive data through sound, electromagnetic radiation, or thermal
									throttling, just for a few examples.
								</p>
								<p>
									Many side channels, including ones we use for iLeakage, comes from the CPU's
									microarchitecture.
									Whenever an attacker and target run on the same CPU, they share the CPU's internal
									resources such as cores, caches, and internal buffers.
									Sharing resources leads to contention, and contention can be measured indirectly
									through several variables like timing or power consumption.
									These measurements leave fingerprints on the target's behavior on the CPU.
									Accordingly, an attacker can abuse this to make inferences about the target's
									secrets even if they are isolated at the process level or the hypervisor level.
								</p>
							</div>
					<div id="panelsStayOpen-collapseSpectre" aria-labelledby="panelsStayOpen-headingSpectre">
								<p>
									Virtually all modern CPUs use a performance optimization where they predict if a
									branch instruction will be taken or not, should the outcome not be readily
									available. Once a prediction is made, the CPU will execute instructions along the
									prediction, a process called speculative execution. If the CPU realizes it had
									mispredicted, it must revert all changes in the state it performed after the
									prediction. Both desktop and mobile CPUs exhibit this behavior, regardless of
									manufacturer (such as Apple, AMD, or Intel).
								</p>
								<p>
									<a href="https://spectreattack.com/">Spectre</a> is a hardware vulnerability in
									virtually all modern CPUs that occurs when speculative execution backfires. While
									the CPU should ideally revert all changes in state, speculative execution leaves
									traces in the CPU's microarchitectural state and especially the cache. A Spectre
									attack coerces the CPU into speculatively executing the wrong flow of instructions.
									If this wrong flow has instructions depending on sensitive data, their value can be
									inferred through a side channel even after the CPU realizes the mistake and reverts
									its changes. An adversary can abuse this behavior to read data that they cannot
									normally access through program semantics. Because speculative execution is an
									important part of CPU performance that is infeasible to simply remove as a
									countermeasure, Spectre continues to be dangerous to software even years after its
									discovery.
								</p>
							</div>
					<div id="panelsStayOpen-collapseDifference" aria-labelledby="panelsStayOpen-headingDifference">
								<p>
									Since the original <a href="https://spectreattack.com/">Spectre</a> exploit, browser
									vendors had significantly hardened browsers against attacks based on speculative and
									transient execution. For the case of Safari, this includes 35-bit addressing and the
									value poisoning, one process per tab isolation policy, as well as a low resolution
									timer.
								</p>
								<p>
									Nonetheless, iLeakage is the first demonstration of a speculative execution attack
									against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_silicon">Apple Silicon</a> CPUs
									and the Safari browser.
									In particular, we show that speculative execution attacks are possible on Apple's
									latest A-series and M-series architectures, despite Apple's side channel hardening.
									More specifically, we first devise an empirical method to recover the cache
									organization of Apple CPUs, since it is not publicly documented. We then use this
									information to develop a gadget that can distinguish cache hits from misses even in
									the absence of a cycle-accurate timer, which is the case for both native and browser
									environments for Apple devices. We use this gadget as both a test to generate cache
									eviction sets and as a covert channel. Finally, we migrate these techniques to the
									Safari browser, where we make Safari run code designed for one datatype on our
									maliciously crafted object of the wrong type while the CPU is performing speculative
									execution. Ultimately, we achieve a out-of-bounds read anywhere in the address space
									of Safari's rendering process.
								</p>
							</div>
					<div id="panelsStayOpen-collapseWorks" aria-labelledby="panelsStayOpen-headingWorks">
							<p>
									In order to construct iLeakage, we first reverse engineer the cache topology on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_silicon">Apple Silicon</a> CPUs.
									We then overcome Apple's timer limitations using a new speculation-based gadget, which allows us
									to distinguish individual cache hits from cache misses, despite having access to only low
									resolution timers. We also demonstrate a variant of this gadget that uses no timers, leveraging
									race conditions instead.
									After using our speculation-based gadget to construct eviction sets, we
									proceded to analyze Safari's side channel resilience. Here, we bypass Safari's 35-bit addressing
									and the value poisoning countermeasures, creating a primitive that can speculatively read and
									leak any 64-bit pointer within Safari's rendering process. Combining this with a new method for
									consolidating websites from different domains into the same address space, we are able to mount
									a speculative type confusion attack that leaks sensitive information.

									On macOS, other popular browsers such as Chrome, Firefox and Microsoft Edge use
									different JavaScript engines. Since iLeakage exploits idiosyncrasies in Safari's
									JavaScript engine, these nuances suffice to deter iLeakage from working on them.
								</p>
								<p>
									However, iOS has a different situation. Due to Apple's App Store and sandboxing
									policies, other browser apps are forced to use Safari's JavaScript engine. That is,
									Chrome, Firefox and Edge on iOS are simply wrappers on top of Safari that provide
									auxiliary features such as synchronizing bookmarks and settings. Consequently,
									nearly every browser application listed on the App Store is vulnerable to iLeakage.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I am thrilled to announce Nile, a serverless Postgres database designed for modern SaaS applications. Modern SaaS applications are multi-tenant. We’re the first database that virtualizes tenants into the database. This enables seamless tenant isolation, per-tenant backups, and placement on multi-tenant or dedicated infrastructure, anywhere on the planet. You can do all this with the experience of a single Postgres! You don’t have to manage multiple databases, build complex permissions for isolation, or write buggy scripts to read specific tenant data from backups. On top of the tenant model, we provide opt-in user management capabilities, customer-specific vector embeddings, and instant tenant admin dashboards. You can do all of this with very little code. Moreover, Nile's Postgres is built for the cloud, enabling effortless scaling and a true serverless experience. You can <a href="https://www.thenile.dev/">sign up for our waitlist</a> today to try it out.</p>
<p>Before Nile, I spent six years at Confluent, helping transform the company from primarily on-premise to a successful global SaaS company. Through this journey, I learned the challenges of launching and scaling a SaaS product to thousands of customers and tens of thousands of users. We spent significant time managing and isolating tenants, supporting different tenant deployment models, dealing with long downtimes to restore tenant data from backups, and optimizing per-tenant performance. We also had to build the organization and user management capabilities, store and move data to different parts of the company, track usage, bill individual customers, and handle many other SaaS problems. When we spoke to many other companies from different verticals, the problems were similar. All these problems in building SaaS were around data, but the database had little to offer.</p>
<p>We started thinking about what an ideal database for SaaS will look like. What foundational elements would it require? How can we create a fully integrated solution that simplifies the development and scaling of SaaS while also offering the flexibility for developers to integrate with their preferred tools? We picked Postgres as our foundational database. We built tenant virtualization into it, allowing many virtual tenant databases to be placed on physical Postgres databases. We built a single database experience to interact with all these virtual tenant DBs. This was a powerful primitive that provided world-class developer experience and helped solve all the tenant management problems. These virtual tenant DBs are isolated, have their own backups, can be placed on multi-tenant or dedicated infrastructure, and can be deployed to any location worldwide.</p>
<p>On top of this basic foundation of tenants, we also built the concept of users and their relationship with the tenants. The authentication and authorization semantics execute on top of this, providing an impregnable level of security for tenants and users. Storing and querying vector embeddings per tenant becomes trivial. They can now be placed closer to the tenant and scale indefinitely when the index size becomes large and resource-consuming. Finally, the database gives out-of-the-box customer admin dashboards to understand and debug issues with tenant and user growth, insights into per-tenant performance, and management controls to perform administrative operations on tenants and users. Finally, the database is built to be serverless and leverage cloud-native solutions. This database, built from first principles, significantly simplifies the development and scaling of SaaS.</p>
<p>We will go deeper to understand what SaaS is, what it means to say they are modern, the current challenges in building them, and finally, what choices and tradeoffs we made in building the database for modern SaaS.</p>
<h2 id="what-makes-saas-modern-and-why-is-it-hard-to-build">What makes SaaS modern, and why is it hard to build?</h2>
<p>SaaS is a pretty overloaded term at this point, and it would be useful to specify how we define it. We define SaaS as any application that’s multi-tenant. A tenant can be a company, an organization, or a workspace in your product that contains a group of users. Here are a few examples of SaaS products and how tenants and users map to them:</p>
<ol>
<li>GitHub helps a group of developers manage and deploy their code. Each Github organization is a tenant, and the developers within those organizations are users.</li>
<li>Salesforce or Hubspot helps sales reps manage their leads. Each company is a tenant, and the users are the sales reps.</li>
<li>Ring is a home security company that provides alarm services to different households. Each household is a tenant, and people living in a house using their service are users.</li>
<li>Toast is a platform to help build software for restaurants. The restaurants are tenants, and the employees of the restaurants are the users.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is clear from these examples that SaaS is a delivery mechanism and will be leveraged by every vertical, including technology, hardware, manufacturing, industrial, legal, etc. Our insight is that 95% of companies fall into this category, and there’s a massive opportunity to simplify the life of developers building these products.</p>
<p>We've spent years building and talking to SaaS companies identifying the core principles of modern SaaS. They're tenant-centric, secure, globally deployed and scalable, fast and responsive, and provide AI-native experiences. Secondary values like data-centricity, real-time, collaboration and offline mode, and monetization are increasingly important. Let's examine them in more detail based on our experience.</p>
<h3 id="customer-or-tenant-centric">Customer or tenant-centric</h3>
<p>A SaaS application provides services to multiple tenants or organizations. Users can create new organizations and get invited to existing ones. They can access the organization irrespective of where they are in the world. One organization's data is perfectly isolated from the other. In addition, you want the performance of one tenant not to affect the other tenants.</p>
<p>There are many other considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where is the tenant’s data located?</li>
<li>What happens when a tenant's data is deleted?</li>
<li>How long will you keep data backups for each tenant?</li>
<li>How can you restore a specific tenant’s data?</li>
<li>How many tenants can you support?</li>
<li>What are the compliance needs for each customer, etc?</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.thenile.dev/blog/github_organization.png" alt="“Github Organization”"></p>
<p><strong>Everything about tenant management is hard.</strong> You typically start with a single database and place all the tenants on it. You tackle data isolation between tenants by implementing brittle permission logic at the application level or complex, hard-to-debug, row-level security policies in databases like Postgres. You turn on daily backups but have little idea how to restore data for specific tenants when customers lose data. You end up writing some hacky scripts that are slow and buggy to parse through the backups and extract the tenant data. Once the application has users, you run into your first performance issue. Some tenants are pushing more load, and others have large datasets causing queries to take more resources. This impacts other customers as well. You need help determining which customer is causing the impact and which ones are being impacted. To solve this, you migrate some tenants to dedicated databases, which requires building metadata and sharding logic at the application layer to manage all this. Schema changes, rollouts, monitoring, and developer experience become more complex. This was our story and every other SaaS company's story.</p>
<h3 id="secure-at-every-step">Secure at every step</h3>
<p>Modern SaaS is all about being secure by default. The data that belongs to one tenant cannot be exposed to another tenant under any circumstances. This is commonly referred to as tenant data isolation. Users should only be able to see the data of tenants to whom they have access. Most applications need to provide modern authentication support, such as social logins and enterprise logins. There has to be support for a fine-grained permission model for users within a tenant. The same user can have different permission policies across different tenants.</p>
<p><strong>These security needs seem simple but are complex to get right for a multi-tenant application in practice.</strong> Most authentication solutions focus on only users and leave developers to think about tenants and the interaction between users and tenants. Organization management is an entire suite of problems that needs deep coordination with the tenant's data in the database. One other critical decision that needs to be made is where the user data resides. Ideally, the primary database should be the source of truth for user data. If not, you must figure out how to sync the data between a third-party service and your primary database. This is a hard problem in distributed systems. Synchronizing user data from a third-party service requires a reliable way to copy it to the primary database, even when failures happen. This cannot be accomplished by stateless event services like webhooks, where you can lose data. You need a reliable replayable event stream to synchronize it. Even with that, you have to deal with eventual consistency in your application. Another option is a two-phase commit between the database and the external service, which is impractical. The cleanest approach is to build auth on top of your source of truth database.</p>

<p>All SaaS companies want to be global from day one. At the same time, customers expect great performance and want their compliance needs to be satisfied.</p>
<p><strong>Providing low latency globally is hard because you need more than optimizing the database performance alone.</strong> The last mile of receiving the response from the server to the client constitutes a significant part of the latency. For example, the network latency between Sydney, Australia, and New York, USA, is around 200 ms on average. This is probably 10x more than the server-side latency of the database. The only solution is to place the data closer to the tenant.
<img src="https://www.thenile.dev/blog/latency_graph.png" alt="“Latency Graph&quot;">
<strong>Achieving compliance requirements in different countries is equally hard, and it also needs data to be stored locally in the country where the application is accessed.</strong> This, again, requires managing multiple databases distributed across the globe. Most companies lose critical business because they cannot provide this capability.</p>
<p>Creating and managing multiple databases across different parts of the globe poses many challenges. This is hard as it creates challenges with schema migrations, is expensive to operate, and requires complex sharding and client-side routing. Developers should be abstracted from these problems and spend their time on the core business logic.</p>
<h2 id="ai-native-experience">AI-native experience</h2>
<p>With the rise of GPT and other open-source large language models, AI-native applications have gained massive traction. Instead of AI being a separate vertical, AI will become more immersive in interacting with SaaS applications. For example, GitHub Copilot provides a seamless experience for developers to use as a coding assistant. Notion provides an AI assistant that helps to write documents, rephrase existing writeups, and summarize long articles (like this one). Hubspot provides a personal chatbot for salespeople to have conversations about their leads and pipelines. It is obvious from these examples where this is heading. New product designs will have AI built in from the start.</p>
<p><strong>The difficulty of building the AI infrastructure for SaaS is that you cannot use the large language models directly.</strong> They are trained on public data and will typically provide incorrect results. They need tenant-specific data to give relevant results. In addition, there are compliance and security issues with sharing all the private data of tenants to a large language model. This requires building architectures like RAG (more about this later) that require creating tenant-specific vector embeddings, storing them, and augmenting the LLM prompt with the tenant context. This will help with avoiding the hallucination problem and also keep the data secure. The latency of querying these embeddings is another challenge, and network latency from the user to the database will further exacerbate it. Finally, vector indexes like HNSW take significant resources and need horizontal scaling if the embeddings grow fast.</p>
<h2 id="highly-available-and-scalable">Highly available and scalable</h2>
<p>Everyone wants their application to be highly available. SaaS applications used to have weekend maintenance schedules to upgrade the database. Some applications still do! This is no longer acceptable for most users. The expectation is to have 99.99 percentile availability. Also, as the application scales, users want things to work as they used to. They don’t want any interruption in service or any performance degradation.</p>
<p><strong>Building a fully automated technology to manage tenant health proactively is not trivial.</strong> You have a service impact if you cannot do zero downtime upgrades. Similarly, you would have customer impact when it takes too long to restore specific tenant data from backups, or developers are manually trying to add more capacity due to a sudden spike in workload or lack of isolation.</p>
<p>In addition to these five principles, modern SaaS also has a few other considerations that are quickly becoming standard.</p>
<p><strong>Data-centric</strong></p>
<p>SaaS applications can be enhanced by providing valuable data insights to the users through the application. Building these data-centric experiences is still a challenge for front-end engineers.</p>
<p><strong>Real-time</strong></p>
<p>This falls into two categories: pushing data as they happen to the application and executing complex business workflows as events happen. Building these flows and connecting all these systems require multiple moving parts today.</p>
<p><strong>Collaborative and offline mode</strong></p>
<p>Applications like Figma and Notion have a collaborative experience built into the product. In addition, you can work offline and sync your data later if you don’t have an internet connection. Techniques like CRDTs needed to solve this are not easy to use.</p>
<p><strong>Monetizable</strong></p>
<p>There is a big shift towards usage-based billing from just charging for the number of seats, especially in these market conditions. The complexity of collecting usage and billing on it is not easy.</p>
<h2 id="designing-a-database-from-first-principles-for-modern-saas">Designing a database from first principles for modern SaaS</h2>
<p>We had a few key criteria that we wanted to take into consideration when we designed the database. We had to pick a good relational database that was highly performant, and extensible with growing popularity. We wanted to consider supporting multiple tenants and how the experience can still be like a single database. The ability to place tenants anywhere on the planet while not losing any of the benefits of a single database in one location was critical. On top of the tenant model, we wanted to design a foundational user model to help support all the user management capabilities. We also had to think about how we will enable vector embedding per tenant and how to support scaling them. Finally, the ability to scale instantaneously and reduce the cost of storage was key factors.</p>
<h3 id="postgres">Postgres</h3>
<p>We needed to pick a database we would build our tooling around, and the obvious choice was Postgres. Postgres is a world-class database that is winning in the OLTP space. This trend will continue, and making Postgres easy for building SaaS is the best way for us to have the maximum impact. In my opinion, one of the biggest reasons for Postgres's success is its wide suite of features and extension flexibility. This is a great foundation to build the right tooling around it, making it world-class for SaaS. A solution with Postgres should provide a fully integrated experience while preserving the complete flexibility and extensibility of Postgres. It should also work well with Postgres’s vast tooling ecosystem.
<img src="https://www.thenile.dev/blog/database_growth.png" alt="“Postgres Growth”"></p>
<h3 id="built-in-tenant-virtualization">Built-in tenant virtualization</h3>
<p>The most foundational element in SaaS is a tenant. It makes a lot of sense to build this core concept into the database. Imagine having a lot of virtual tenant databases that can be co-located on one physical Postgres (multi-tenant) for better cost, and some of them can be placed on a dedicated database for better isolation. The virtual tenant DBs can be located anywhere on the planet for low latency or compliance. The client can route to the right tenant seamlessly without routing logic in the application.</p>
<p>Isolating tenants into their own virtual DBs is great, but you will also want to be able to share data across tenants where it makes sense. Backups should be available for each tenant, and it should be possible to restore them instantaneously. Schema changes should be applied seamlessly across all the tenant DBs, and it should also be possible to do staged rollouts for different tenant tiers. While supporting all this, all the standard SQL capabilities should work across the tenants for admin operations. All the standard Postgres tooling should work. You want the experience of a single Postgres! This sounds like magic, and we can make this magic a reality.</p>
<p>The experience would be something as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Creating a new virtual tenant DB is as simple as a standard insert into the tenant's table</strong>. By default, the tenant will get created on a multi-tenant Postgres in the default region. You should be able to specify any location in the world or the infrastructure type if you want a dedicated Postgres for a tenant (more on this in the next section).</p>
<pre><code><span>-- create a record for the first customer</span>
<span>insert</span> <span>into</span> tenants (name) <span>VALUES</span> (<span>'customer1'</span>);
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Creating a new table for each tenant should be like standard table creation</strong>, and the database should ensure all the virtual tenant DBs get the schema changes applied to them. Let us call them tenant-aware tables.</p>
<pre><code><span>-- creating an employee table that is tenant aware</span>
<span>create</span> <span>table</span> employees (
  tenant_id uuid,
  id <span>integer</span>,
  name text,
  age <span>integer</span>,
  address text,
  start_date <span>timestamp</span>,
  title text,
  <span>CONSTRAINT</span> FK_tenants <span>FOREIGN</span> KEY(tenant_id) <span>REFERENCES</span> tenants(id),
  <span>CONSTRAINT</span> PK_employee <span>PRIMARY</span> KEY(tenant_id,id));
</code></pre>
<p>With the table in place, you can add rows for a specific tenant. Let us say tenant “customer 1” has a few employees that must be added to the system.</p>
<pre><code><span>-- adding employees for customer 1</span>
<span>insert</span> <span>into</span> employees (tenant_id, id, name, age, address, start_date, title)
<span>values</span>
  (<span>'018ac98e-b37a-731b-b03a-6617e8fd5266'</span>,<span>1345</span>,<span>'Jason'</span>,<span>30</span>,<span>'Sunnyvale,California'</span>,<span>'2016-12-22 19:10:25-07'</span>,<span>'software engineer'</span>),
  (<span>'018ac98e-b37a-731b-b03a-6617e8fd5266'</span>,<span>2423</span>,<span>'Minnie'</span>,<span>24</span>,<span>'Seattle,Washingtom'</span>,<span>'2018-11-11 12:09:22-06'</span>,<span>'sales engineer'</span>),
  (<span>'018ac98e-b37a-731b-b03a-6617e8fd5266'</span>,<span>4532</span>,<span>'Shiva'</span>,<span>32</span>,<span>'Fremont, California'</span>,<span>'2019-09-05 04:03:12-05'</span>,<span>'product manager'</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>Now, let us assume a second tenant, “customer 2” needs to be added to the system, and a few employees are added to this new tenant. This would again create another virtual tenant DB. The inserts will route to the right virtual tenant DB, but the experience will be like simply inserting into the employee's table.</p>
<pre><code><span>-- create the second customer</span>
<span>insert</span> <span>into</span> tenants (name) <span>VALUES</span> (<span>'customer2'</span>);

<span>-- insert employees for the second customer</span>
<span>insert</span> <span>into</span> employees (tenant_id, id, name, age, address, start_date, title)
<span>values</span>
  (<span>'018aca35-b8c4-7674-882c-30ae56d7b479'</span>,<span>5643</span>,<span>'John'</span>,<span>36</span>,<span>'London,UK'</span>,<span>'2017-12-12 19:10:25-07'</span>,<span>'senior software engineer'</span>),
  (<span>'018aca35-b8c4-7674-882c-30ae56d7b479'</span>,<span>1532</span>,<span>'Mark'</span>,<span>27</span>,<span>'Manchester,UK'</span>,<span>'2022-10-10 12:09:22-06'</span>,<span>'support engineer'</span>),
  (<span>'018aca35-b8c4-7674-882c-30ae56d7b479'</span>,<span>8645</span>,<span>'Sam'</span>,<span>42</span>,<span>'Liverpool,UK'</span>,<span>'2015-08-04 04:03:12-05'</span>,<span>'product manager'</span>);
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Directing queries to a specific tenant DB and getting full data isolation should be as easy as specifying the tenant ID in the session context</strong> . The client library can even abstract this by invoking this for you, depending on what tenant_id is trying to access data. This should all work out of the box without struggling with complex permissions, managing multiple databases, or dealing with error-prone row-level security policies.</p>
<pre><code><span>-- set the session context to a specific tenant</span>
<span>-- who needs to be isolated.</span>
<span>set</span> nile.tenant_id <span>=</span> <span>'018ac98e-b37a-731b-b03a-6617e8fd5266'</span>;

<span>select</span> <span>*</span> <span>from</span> employees
</code></pre>

<p><strong>The best part is you should still be able to query across the tenant DBs like a
standard table if you don’t specify any context.</strong></p>
<pre><code><span>select</span> <span>*</span> <span>from</span> employees
</code></pre>

<p>While there’s a need for virtual tenant DBs that isolate data, there’s also a need
to <a href="https://www.thenile.dev/docs/tenant-sharing">share data across tenants</a>. It should
be easy to create shared tables that can be accessed by/[across] all tenants and
are globally available. All standard queries should work seamlessly both on tenant-aware
and shared tables</p>
<pre><code>
<span>-- list of flights that a corporate travel booking site can use to share across all the tenants.</span>
<span>-- employees in different tenants can view these flight data to book tickets</span>
<span>create</span> <span>table</span> flights (
  id <span>integer</span> <span>PRIMARY</span> KEY,
  name text,
  from_location text,
  to_location text,
  departure_time <span>TIMESTAMP</span>,
  arrival_time <span>TIMESTAMP</span>
);

</code></pre>
<h3 id="global-and-flexible-tenant-placement">Global and flexible tenant placement</h3>
<p>When building a modern SaaS application, the critical factors that need to be considered are latency, performance isolation, compliance, and cost. The capability of a database to place tenants has a significant impact on achieving this balance.</p>
<p>Placement can be of two types:</p>
<p><strong>Regional placement</strong></p>
<p>You want to place individual tenants (customers) in different regions worldwide for compliance or latency reasons. You should be able to create the tenant database in any available location without worrying about the number of databases or the operational complexity.</p>
<pre><code><span>insert</span> <span>into</span> tenants (name, region)
<span>values</span> (<span>'customer 1'</span>, <span>'aws-us-east1'</span>);

<span>insert</span> <span>into</span> tenants (name, region)
<span>values</span> (<span>'customer 2'</span>, <span>'aws-eu-west1'</span>);
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Infrastructure placement</strong></p>
<p>You will want to place tenants in a multi-tenant or dedicated physical database. The decision for this will depend on the customer's needs, cost, and level of isolation needed. Typically, you would start to place all your customers in a multi-tenant database and then have the need to place some tenants on dedicated physical databases.</p>
<pre><code><span>insert</span> <span>into</span> tenants (name, region, deployment_mode)
<span>values</span> (<span>'customer 2'</span>, <span>'aws-us-east1'</span>, <span>'dedicated'</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>The client should be able to route to the right tenant without any work from the user. Also, while providing all the placement flexibility, the magic lies in providing the ability to manage all these tenants in different locations and placements like a single Postgres instance. Here are a couple of examples where this will be useful:</p>
<p>Make schema changes once, and the database should apply the change across all the virtual tenant DBs</p>
<pre><code><span>-- the bookings table where each row represents a single booking</span>
<span>-- for a specific employee within a customer/tenant</span>
<span>create</span> <span>table</span> bookings (
  tenant_id uuid,
  booking_id <span>integer</span>,
  employee_id text,
  flight_id <span>integer</span>,
  total_price <span>float</span>,
  <span>PRIMARY</span> KEY(tenant_id,booking_id));
</code></pre>
<p>Query across tenants for insights like a single database</p>
<pre><code><span>-- Calculates the total no of candidates per tenant that have</span>
<span>-- applied for a job for a recruiting product. Can be used to define</span>
<span>-- active tenants</span>
<span>select</span> t1.id <span>as</span> customer_id,t1.name <span>as</span> customer_name,
<span>count</span>(c1.id) <span>as</span> no_of_candidates <span>from</span> candidates c1
<span>right</span> <span>join</span> tenants t1 <span>on</span> c1.tenant_id<span>=</span>t1.id <span>group</span> <span>by</span> t1.id,t1.name;
</code></pre>
<h3 id="first-class-support-for-users">First-class support for users</h3>
<p>The first basic primitive of a database built for SaaS is tenants. The second is users. Managing users in the context of tenants is complex, and having built-in support will make application development significantly faster. In addition, it will help to store user data in the database with strong consistency and correctness. Authentication should provide a suite of tools that makes it easy to drop in a form to get end-to-end authentication supported for tenants and users in minutes. This should support the entire lifecycle of tenant or organization management, including inviting users to an organization, deleting an organization that soft deletes the tenants in the underlying database, and providing overrides for each tenant to configure custom authentications.
<img src="https://www.thenile.dev/blog/authcode.png" alt="“Auth Code&quot;"></p>
<p>For permissions, basic enforcement of what data users get access to should be easier than it is today. When a user belongs to a specific tenant, access should automatically be restricted to other tenants. You don’t need application logic or complex SQL policies to enforce and maintain this. In addition, permissions should have a flexible language to help define fine-grained column-level resource permissions. The best part is that no instrumentations are required in code, which is often buggy due to the different paths that need to be secured. Instead, permission at source is the strongest security guarantee you can get.</p>
<p>While the database should provide a fantastic solution out of the box, it should also be flexible for users to bring their own auth. This includes building your own authentication or integrating another third-party auth with the database. Great developer platforms can provide flexibility and let developers have finer control over how they want to build out their applications.</p>
<h3 id="domain-and-tenant-aware-ai-native-architecture">Domain and tenant-aware AI-native architecture</h3>
<p>Every SaaS application will be an AI-native application like every software application was a SaaS-native application when SaaS happened. SaaS revolutionized how software was delivered. AI will revolutionize how software is experienced.</p>
<p>AI for SaaS needs to be specific to the domain and tenant. For example,</p>
<ol>
<li>A corporate wiki (e.g., Confluence, Notion) where the employees can perform a semantic search on their company data</li>
<li>A chatbot for a CRM (e.g., Salesforce, Hubspot) that sales reps can use to ask questions about past and future customer deals and can have a back-and-forth conversation</li>
<li>An autopilot for developers in their code repository (Github, Gitlab) to improve productivity. The autopilot should run on the company's code as well, apart from learning from public repositories.</li>
</ol>
<p>A powerful architecture to achieve this is Retrieval augmented generation(RAG). The idea is to prevent large language models from hallucinating by augmenting the prompt with relevant context. This is usually done by converting the tenant's data set and the query to a common format called embeddings. The prompt issued by the user belonging to a specific tenant will be augmented with more context from that tenant's embeddings. This helps LLMs to be more contextual and also more secure.</p>
<p>A database for SaaS should have native support for storing vector embeddings per tenant. It should also help store the metadata relevant to each tenant and the embeddings. Given Postgres is our choice, the pgvector extension combined with tenant virtualization would be powerful.</p>
<pre><code><span>create</span> <span>table</span> wiki_documents(tenant_id uuid, id <span>integer</span>, embedding vector(<span>3</span>));

<span>insert</span> <span>into</span> wiki_documents(tenant_id, id, embedding)
<span>values</span> (<span>'018ade1a-7843-7e60-9686-714bab650998'</span>, <span>1</span>, <span>'[1,2,3]'</span>);

<span>select</span> embedding <span>&lt;</span><span>-</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>'[3,1,2]'</span> <span>as</span> distance <span>from</span> wiki_documents;
</code></pre>
<p>You get the following benefits with such a system:</p>
<ol>
<li>Embeddings and metadata computed and stored per tenant</li>
<li>Embeddings and metadata are stored near the customer to speed up the first-byte response to a query</li>
<li>HNSW and IVFLAT index support from pg_vector</li>
<li>Unlimited scaling of embeddings since tenants can be distributed and sharded. HNSW is a pretty resource-intensive</li>
<li>Purpose-built SDKs that integrate with LLM hosts such as OpenAI and Huggingface and vector embeddings.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="serverless-and-cloud-native">Serverless and cloud-native</h3>
<p>Serverless is how developers will adopt databases in the next decade. Before anyone jumps to say, “There is no such thing as serverless. There are only other people's servers”, the intent of using serverless is to define the experience developers get. It does not mean that the database is implemented without any servers! A database for SaaS should allow developers to focus on their queries, use cases, and core application logic. Developers don’t have to worry about managing capacity, the server configurations, or paying for capacity they don’t use. This gets even more complex if you want to manage multiple databases for each tenant. A database should let you have any number of virtual tenant databases but give you all the goodness of serverless. It should enforce price limits and ensure developers don’t get a sticker shock. The goal of serverless is to care about developers, which is exactly what it should do.</p>
<p>The second thing is that the database needs to be built for the cloud. This means leveraging the native cloud infrastructure to build a highly scalable and elastic system. It makes sense to decouple storage and compute and push storage to cloud storage like S3. This helps to keep the compute stateless and makes it easier to scale them quickly. You still want to shard the tenants across databases and regions to provide placement flexibility (regional and infrastructure placement) and scale the storage as needed.</p>
<h3 id="tenant-level-insights-and-administration">Tenant-level insights and administration</h3>
<p>A huge part of building and running a SaaS application is to understand the growth and performance of each tenant and optimize it. This has been traditionally hard for SaaS. Most want a simple way to look up their active customers, users, and product usage to understand better how the different queries are performing for each customer.</p>
<p>The database should have native support for this. Given it understands tenant boundaries, users within those tenants, and all the queries executed in that context, it would be trivial to show relevant insights to the developers. Developers should be able to understand the growth of the product, how the query performs for each tenant, and past trends. All the performance metrics, usage metrics, and even logs can be understood for each tenant. Postgres tools such as pg_stats, EXPLAIN, and ANALYZE should work and provide insights by tenant.
<img src="https://www.thenile.dev/blog/nile_dashboard.png" alt="“Nile Dashboard”"></p>
<h3 id="world-class-developer-experience">World-class developer experience</h3>
<p>Databases still need to be made easier to use. While Postgres does a great job, there is still a lot of friction in the end-to-end developer journey to build SaaS applications with a cloud-native database. Developers should be able to test locally with the DB for a rapid feedback loop on their laptop, create test databases to apply schema changes, and then migrate to production. This whole experience should be integrated well with a change management system like GitHub. Lastly, ensuring a thriving developer community around the database is key to helping each other and learning quickly.</p>
<h3 id="and-some-more">And some more</h3>
<p>There are many more things I chose not to talk about now. Things like propagating real-time changes per tenant to the front end, supporting analytics to build data-centric applications, and leveraging usage data per tenant for monetization are all critical topics in building SaaS. The tenant virtualization is the basic building block. Many SaaS tooling and integrations can be built on this foundation to make it easy to build and scale the product.

					<p>How this one small browser quirk turned into a tool used by countless people for decades.</p>
			<hr>
				
<p>In 1995, Brendan Eich demoed what would eventually become JavaScript to a room full of engineers at Netscape. It was met with instant enthusiasm. For his demo, Eich opened up his version of the browser and typed a command right into the address bar, which opened up a console and allowed him to demonstrate an alert box. Six months later, the first version of JavaScript shipped with Netscape Navigator 2.</p>



<p>JavaScript in the address bar, as a protocol for a URL, was possible virtually from day one of the language, effectively creating JavaScript URLs. And even in the first version, “visiting” a JavaScript URL triggered a change on the current page, rather than opening up an entirely new one.&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111127233722/http://www.sitepoint.com/bookmarklets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eich even added the&nbsp;<code>void</code>&nbsp;operator</a>&nbsp;to an early version of JavaScript to make it possible to create arbitrary functions with values right in that URL.</p>



<p>To introduce new developers to JavaScript, Netscape released a comprehensive guide on how to use it. And in that guide, they&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030609224912/http://devedge.netscape.com/library/manuals/2000/javascript/1.3/guide/advtopic.html#1004952" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">included a short snippet about these JavaScript URLs</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>You are probably familiar with the standard types of URLs: http:, ftp:, file:, and so on. With Navigator, you can also use URLs of type javascript: to execute JavaScript statements instead of loading a document. You simply use a string beginning with javascript: as the value for the HREF attribute of anchor tags.</p>



<p><code>&lt;A HREF="javascript:history.go(0)"&gt;Reload Now&lt;/A&gt;</code></p>



<p>In general, you can put any statements or function calls after the&nbsp;<code>javascript:</code>&nbsp;URL prefix.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>So you ended up with this JavaScript quirk where it was possible to create unique URLs that ran a bit of JavaScript on whatever page you happened to be looking at. It could even make changes to that page. Move things around. Replace words. Open links. And pretty early on, people realized that these JavaScript URLs were also bookmarkable, just like any other URL.</p>



<p>And, crucially, easily shareable as links.</p>



<p>As rapid iteration spread through the early web, one corner of that world began experimenting with these bookmarkable, shareable JavaScript URLs to manipulate and transform web pages. Some early examples were used to quickly&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010503103754/http://www.squarefree.com/bookmarklets/pagelinks.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open all the links on a page</a>, for instance, or&nbsp;<a href="http://tantek.com/favelets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">run the current page through a validator</a>. But there were also plenty of unique utilities as well, like interacting with online services,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/bookmarklets-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">manipulating images on a page</a>, or even&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010505005613/http://www.squarefree.com/bookmarklets/tipping.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tipping the website owner</a>.</p>



<p>Early versions of the browser also featured something which has faded away in recent years. The bookmarks bar (or sometimes, the favorites bar). Up at the top of the browser window, below the URL, was a list of bookmarks. The easiest way to share a JavaScript URL was to drag one into your bookmarks bar, and then use it as you were surfing around.</p>



<p><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/aoi3fgebjgr/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/what-is-a-bookmarklet-internet-explorer-300x194.jpg" alt="An example of a bookmarklet in action" width="300" height="194" srcset="https://ik.imagekit.io/aoi3fgebjgr/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/what-is-a-bookmarklet-internet-explorer-300x194.jpg 300w, https://ik.imagekit.io/aoi3fgebjgr/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/what-is-a-bookmarklet-internet-explorer.jpg 346w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>



<p>It is difficult to trace the exact moment that all of this began, but there did come a time when the concept—a shareable JavaScript URL that acted as some sort of personal utility—needed a name. In December of 1998, Steve Kangas did just that, when he launched Bookmarklets.com. And the bookmarklet (or Favlet,&nbsp;<a href="http://tantek.com/favelets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as it was called by Tantek Çelik</a>) started spreading.</p>



<p>Even in the first few months, Kangas had a list of over a hundred bookmarklets to share, that he had compiled and created. Some could be used to search a page for specific links or text. Others could alter the appearance of a page, removing images, changing the color or making things more readable. Some were fun (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150603003341/http://www.bookmarklets.com/tools/misc/index.phtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a bookmarklet that could make a Valentine’s Day heart dance across the page</a>) and some were unadorned and simple (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110128083629/http://www.bookmarklets.com/tools/data/index.phtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">turn text underlines on or off</a>).</p>

<p>Bookmarklets are interesting. They are generally limited by browsers to a certain number of characters, which means they require efficient code that make use of the quirks of the language. They can’t be too complex or verbose. They usually have to be minified, which is a process of taking human readable JavaScript code and removing as many complicated variable names and whitespace as is needed. A Bookmarklet generally wasn’t able to do ten things at once. Each one did one thing, and did it well. That directness and focus made it all the more easy to share them around and instantly understand their utility. And bookmarklets became very popular.</p>



<p>Browsers have also typically featured another way to change and manipulate a page. They’ve been called add-ons, plugins, and extensions, but they are an officially supported way of interacting with a browser and extending its functionality. For a long time, however, they were difficult to manage and install. You had to find what you were looking for, download it, and find the right place to put it on your computer. They were useful cases, but not necessarily a viable alternative to Bookmarklets, which were easily shareable and dead simple.</p>



<p>In 2007, Moziilla Firefox released its Add-ons Gallery, a much simpler way to discover and install official Firefox add-ons. It was a searchable and categorized index of add-ons that any developer could add to. Add-ons were officially supported, were reviewed for security, and could be installed with one click. In 2009, Chrome added an extension gallery with similar features.</p>

<p>As those browsers rose in market share, extensions began to overtake bookmarklets in popularity. The Bookmarks bar faded to the background more. Bookmarklets are still in use, and still quite useful, but they are ….</p>

That will let it venture out over the south San Francisco Bay, without interfering with planes flying into or out of San Jose and San Francisco International commercial airports. </p><p>In a letter supporting its application for the certificate, LTA wrote: “Pathfinder 1’s experimental flight test program is to demonstrate and establish the flight envelope for the airship…. LTA’s test plan is tailored to include substantial indoor and outdoor ground testing, using a build-up approach to gradually increase the flight envelope.”</p><p>The huge airship will initially be attached to a mobile mast for outdoor ground testing, before conducting about 25 low-level flights, for a total of 50 hours’ flight time. </p><p>Although its rigid design hearkens back to the gargantuan airships of the early 20th century, Pathfinder 1 is almost completely different from any large airship that has flown before. Crucially, its <a href="https://www.ltaresearch.com/technology" target="_blank">reported</a> 96 welded titanium hubs and 288 carbon fiber reinforced polymer tubes are light enough that it can use non-flammable helium instead of explosive hydrogen as a lifting gas. </p><p><img alt="Interior view of the airship's foundation during construction." data-rm-shortcode-id="38da14c974a020e52bfaaa29d4a6e3f4" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/interior-view-of-the-airship-s-foundation-during-construction.jpg?id=50295607&amp;width=980" height="1693" id="e5a30" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/interior-view-of-the-airship-s-foundation-during-construction.jpg?id=50295607&amp;width=980" width="3300"><small data-gramm="false" data-lt-tmp-id="lt-504252" placeholder="Add Photo Caption..." spellcheck="false">LTA’s airship frames are made of lightweight titanium and carbon-fiber.  </small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">LTA Research and Exploration</small></p><p>Twelve electric motors distributed on the sides and tail of the airship, and four fin rudders, allow for vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/airship" target="_self">speeds of up to about 120 kilometers per hour</a>.

Brin runs a separate non-profit, called <a href="https://gsd.ngo/en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Global Support and Development</a>, that has already carried out such missions by sea, in the Caribbean, Latin American and the South Pacific. It originally used Brin’s own superyacht to ferry medical personnel to the scene of hurricanes and other disasters, and recently launched a purpose built vessel capable of transporting dozens of medical staff and full-size shipping containers. The <a href="https://gsd.ngo/en/what-we-do/humanitarian-vessel" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MV Dawn</a> also carries its own watercraft and vehicles, and is capable of producing and off-loading bulk supplies of fresh water, and could be a model for future humanitarian airships. </p><p>Pathfinder 1’s airworthiness certificate is valid for a full year although LTA told the FAA in its application letter that it expects the test program to be complete within 180 days. </p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>If you’re anything like me, when you’re starting a project, there’s a paralyzing period of indecision while you try to figure out how to build it. In the JavaScript world, that usually boils down to picking a framework. Do you go with Ol’ Reliable, a.k.a. React? Something slimmer and trendier, like Svelte or Solid? How about kicking it old school with a server-side framework and HTMX?</p>
<p>When I was writing my <a href="https://jakelazaroff.com/words/an-interactive-intro-to-crdts/" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">CRDT blog post series</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://jakelazaroff.com/words/an-interactive-intro-to-crdts/" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><img src="https://jakelazaroff.com/og/an-interactive-intro-to-crdts.png" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">An Interactive Intro to CRDTs | jakelazaroff.com</span><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">CRDTs don't have to be all academic papers and math jargon.

Here’s an example: a toy collaborative pixel art editor.</p>
<pixelart-demo></pixelart-demo>

<p>Even though I’ve written before — and still believe — that <a href="https://jakelazaroff.com/words/no-one-ever-got-fired-for-choosing-react/" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">React is a good default option</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://jakelazaroff.com/words/no-one-ever-got-fired-for-choosing-react/" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><img src="https://jakelazaroff.com/og/no-one-ever-got-fired-for-choosing-react.png" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">No One Ever Got Fired for Choosing React | jakelazaroff.com</span><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">If you spend a lot of time on Hacker News, it’s easy to get taken by the allure of building a project without a framework.</span><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><img src="https://jakelazaroff.com/favicon.ico" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">jakelazaroff.com/words/no-one-ever-got-fired-for-choosing-react/</span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16"><use href="/icons.svg#share"></use></svg></span></a>, the constraints of a project should determine the technology decisions. In this case, I chose to use vanilla JS web components. I want to talk about why.</p>
<p>There was one guiding principle for this project: although they happened to be built with HTML, CSS and JS, these examples were <strong>content, not code</strong>. In other words, they’d be handled more or less the same as any image or video I would include in my blog posts. They should be portable to any place in which I can render HTML.</p>

I really like Astro, but it’s reasonable to assume that this website won’t run on it forever.</p>
<p>One thing that has made these migrations easier in recent years is keeping all my content in plain text files written in Markdown. Rather than dealing with the invariably convoluted process of moving my content between systems — exporting it from one, importing it into another, fixing any incompatibilities, maybe removing some things that I can’t find a way to port over — I drop my Markdown files into the new website and it mostly Just Works.</p>
<p>Most website generators have a way to include more complex markup within your content, and Astro is no different. The MDX integration allows you to render Astro components within your Markdown files. Those components have access to all the niceties of the Astro build system: you can write HTML, CSS and JS within one file, and Astro will automagically extract and optimize everything for you. It will scope CSS selectors and compile TypeScript and let you conditionally render markup and do all sorts of other fancy stuff.</p>
<p>The drawback, of course, is that it all only works inside Astro. In order to switch to a different site generator, I’d have to rewrite those components. I might need to split up the HTML, CSS and JS, or configure a new build system, or find a new way to scope styles. So Astro-specific features were off limits — no matter how convenient.</p>
<p>But Markdown has a secret weapon: <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#html" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">you can write HTML inside of it</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#html" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">Daring Fireball: Markdown Syntax Documentation</span><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><img src="https://daringfireball.net/graphics/favicon.ico#html" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#html</span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16"><use href="/icons.svg#share"></use></svg></span></a>! That means any fancy interactive diagrams I wanted to add would be just as portable as my the rest of my Markdown as long as I could express them as plain HTML tags.</p>

They’re a set of W3C standards for building reusable HTML elements. You use them by writing a class for a custom element, registering a tag name and using it in your markup. Here’s how I embedded that pixel art editor before:</p>
<pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>pixelart-demo</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>pixelart-demo</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre>
<p>That’s the honest-to-goodness HTML I have in the Markdown for this post. That’s it! There’s no special setup; I don’t have to remember to put specific elements on the page before calling a function or load a bunch of extra resources.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-cheating" id="user-content-fnref-cheating" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">1</a></sup> Of course, I do need to keep the JS files around and link to them with a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag. But that goes for any media: there needs to be <strong>some</strong> way to reference it from within textual content. With web components, once the script is loaded, the tag name gets registered and works anywhere on the page — even if the markup is present before the JavaScript runs.</p>
<p>Web components encapsulate all their HTML, CSS and JS within a single file, with no build system necessary. Having all the code for a component in one place significantly reduces my mental overhead, and I continue to be a huge fan of single-file components for their developer experience. While web components aren’t <strong>quite</strong> as nice to write as their Astro or Svelte counterparts, they’re still super convenient.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-frameworks" id="user-content-fnref-frameworks" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">2</a></sup></p>

As long as I keep all the files together, the browser will sort everything out.</p>
<p>Another nice thing about Web components is shadow DOM, which isolates the component from the surrounding page. I think shadow DOM is often awkward when you want to share styles between your components and the rest of your app, but it’s perfect when you do truly want everything to be isolated. Just like images and videos, these components will look and act the same no matter where they’re used.</p>
<p>Sorry — they’re not <strong>just</strong> like images and videos. Web components can expose attributes that allow you to configure them from the outside. You can think of them as native props. Voilà:</p>


<p>Two input ranges with different accent colors. In this case, I’m just setting a CSS variable, which is one of the few things allowed into the shadow DOM:</p>
<pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>range-slider</span> <span><span>style</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span><span>--accent</span><span>:</span> #0085F2</span><span>"</span></span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>range-slider</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Here’s a more complex example:</p>
<pixelart-demo debug="true" resolution="20"></pixelart-demo>

<p>And here’s the markup. It uses attributes to alter the component’s behavior, setting the resolution to 20 and showing debug information on every pixel:</p>
<pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>pixelart-demo</span> <span>debug</span> <span>resolution</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>20<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>pixelart-demo</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre>
<p>If you were wondering what those calls to <code>getAttribute</code> and <code>hasAttribute</code> were doing in the web component class, now you know. This was particularly useful when reusing the same component for different stages of a tutorial, allowing me to enable certain features as the tutorial progressed.</p>
<p>The other part of the equation was using vanilla JS. There are frameworks that compile to web components — most notably Lit (although I’d call it more of a library) but also Stencil, Svelte, and probably others. I’m sure they’re all wonderful tools that would have made my life easier in a lot of ways. But frameworks are dependencies, and dependencies have a bunch of tradeoffs. In this case, the tradeoff I’m most worried about is maintenance.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-vendoring" id="user-content-fnref-vendoring" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">4</a></sup></p>
<p>That goes for TypeScript, too. By my count, the last 15 versions of TypeScript have had breaking changes — many of them new features that I was happy to have, even though I had to change my code to accommodate them. But as much as I love TypeScript, it’s not a native substrate of the web. It’s still a dependency.</p>
<p>There’s a cost to using dependencies. New versions are released, APIs change, and it takes time and effort to make sure your own code remains compatible with them. And the cost accumulates over time. It would be one thing if I planned to continually work on this code; it’s usually simple enough to migrate from one version of a depenency to the next. But I’m not planning to ever really touch this code again unless I absolutely need to. And if I <strong>do</strong> ever need to touch this code, I <strong>really</strong> don’t want to go through multiple years’ worth of updates all at once.</p>

<p>I’ve been building on the web for almost 20 years. That’s long enough to witness the birth, rise and fall of jQuery. Node.js was created, forked into io.js and merged back into Node. Backbone burst onto the scene and was quickly replaced with AngularJS, which was replaced with React, which has been around for only half that time and has <strong>still</strong> gone through like five different ways to write components.</p>
<p>But as the ecosystem around it swirled, the web platform itself remained remarkably stable — largely because the stewards of the standards painstakingly ensured that no new change would break existing websites.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-smooshgate" id="user-content-fnref-smooshgate" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">5</a></sup> The <a href="https://www.spacejam.com/1996/" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">original Space Jam website</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://www.spacejam.com/1996/" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">Space Jam</span><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><img src="https://www.spacejam.com/favicon.ico" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">www.spacejam.com/1996/</span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16"><use href="/icons.svg#share"></use></svg></span></a> from 1996 is famously still up, and renders perfectly in modern browsers.

<p>If we want that sort of longevity, we need to avoid dependencies that we don’t control and stick to standards that we know won’t break. If we want our work to be accessible in five or ten or even 20 years, we need to use the web with no layers in between. For all its warts, the web has become the most resilient, portable, future-proof computing platform we’ve ever created — at least, if we build with that in mind.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="preview-section-introduction"><h2>Introduction</h2><section id="s0005"><p id="p0010">Loyalty is a foundational moral principle, or virtue, that people usually value and aspire to embody in their social and business relations (Altman, 2008; Coughlan, 2005; Fiske, 1991, Fiske, 1992; Graham et al., 2011, Graham et al., 2013, Graham et al., 2018; Haidt &amp; Graham, 2007; Haidt &amp; Joseph, 2007; Reichheld, Markey Jr, &amp; Hopton, 2000; Shweder, Much, Mahapatra, &amp; Park, 1997; Souryal &amp; McKay, 1996; Van Kenhove, De Wulf, &amp; Steenhaut, 2003). Those who display loyalty to their countries, families, companies, religious organizations, sports teams, and other groups are publicly venerated (at least among their own group members), and the value placed on loyalty is emphasized in national oaths of allegiance, military and business mottos, anthems, literature, film, awards, and codes of conduct (Coleman, 2009; Connor, 2007; Hildreth, Gino, &amp; Bazerman, 2016; Kruger, 2021; Reichheld &amp; Teal, 2001; Souryal &amp; McKay, 1996). Individuals with reputations for loyalty (relative to those without such reputations) are considered to be better friends (Shaw, DeScioli, Barakzai, &amp; Kurzban, 2017), employees (Hirschman, 1970; McGinley &amp; Shi, 2022), and leaders (Fehr, Yam, &amp; Dang, 2015). Loyalty can also facilitate prosocial behavior by encouraging people to help others in their organizations and communities, and it can foster trust and cooperation among group members to achieve shared goals (Graham et al., 2011; Hirschman, 1970; Powers, 2000; Reichheld &amp; Teal, 2001; Rosanas &amp; Velilla, 2003). Disloyalty, in contrast, tends to elicit disgust, contempt, and moral outrage among observers, often damaging personal and professional reputations (Baumeister &amp; Leary, 1995; Haidt, 2003; McManus, Kleiman-Weiner, &amp; Young, 2020; Rousseau, 2001; Rozin, Lowery, Imada, &amp; Haidt, 1999).</p><p id="p0015">Decades of research across the fields of organizational behavior, psychology, evolutionary biology, and business ethics have identified numerous positive outcomes of loyalty and negative outcomes of disloyalty (Berry, Lewis Jr, &amp; Sowden, 2021; Haidt, 2003; Hirschman, 1970; Kruger, 2021; Powers, 2000; Reichheld &amp; Teal, 2001; Rosanas &amp; Velilla, 2003; Sinn &amp; Hayes, 2017; Van Kenhove et al., 2003). But is loyalty always beneficial? Although people tend to value loyalty as a moral virtue, it is possible that loyal people are disproportionately (and ironically) targeted for potentially harmful and unfair managerial practices in the contemporary workplace. Employing complementary methods and designs, we investigate whether and why loyalty could lead to deleterious consequences for those who are loyal. More specifically, we first investigate whether workers who have reputations for loyalty are perceived to be more exploitable, because loyal individuals are expected to make personal sacrifices for the objects of their loyalty.<sup>1</sup> We then investigate whether those employees who agree to poor treatment boost their reputations for being loyal. If workers are perceived to be more exploitable because of their reputations for loyalty and if agreeing to poor treatment boosts workers' reputations for loyalty, these bidirectional causal relations have the potential to create a vicious circle of suffering for certain workers.</p><section id="s0010"><p id="p0020">Researchers across different fields have examined several constructs related to loyalty that describe different components of interpersonal bonds and social relationships (e.g., feelings of attachment, commitment, identification, liking, love; Abrams &amp; Hogg, 1988; Brewer, 1999; Schrag, 2001; Mowday, Steers, &amp; Porter, 1979; O'Reilly &amp; Chatman, 1986; Mael &amp; Ashforth, 1992; Rubin, 1973; Seligman, Fazio, &amp; Zanna, 1980; Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1979; Scott, 1965; Sternberg, 1986). Much of what makes loyalty unique and distinct from related constructs is its inherent <em>moral</em> nature (Hildreth et al., 2016). That is, loyalty is a <em>moral</em> principle or virtue. The quintessential moral nature of loyalty is important because it creates a strong expectation, or perhaps even an obligation or imperative, to act in an individual's or group's interest, because it is the morally right thing to do (Hildreth et al., 2016).</p><p id="p0025">The inherent moral nature of loyalty is reflected in recent theorizing. For example, Shweder et al. (1997) argue that there are three distinct, cross-cultural “codes of morality” – community, autonomy, and divinity – that drive human action, with loyalty being central to the code of community. Drawing on insights from cultural anthropology, evolutionary psychology, and social psychology, <em>Moral Foundations Theory</em> (MFT) contends that loyalty is one of five innate foundations of morality that emerged to contend with scarce resources and social challenges (Graham, Haidt, &amp; Nosek, 2009; Graham et al., 2013, Graham et al., 2018, Graham et al., 2011; Haidt &amp; Joseph, 2007). Taking a social-relational approach to morality, <em>Relationship Regulation Theory</em> (Rai &amp; Fiske, 2011) posits four fundamental and distinct moral motives or obligations—unity, hierarchy, equality, and proportionality—that drive moral action, with loyalty being central in the motive/obligation for unity (see also, Fiske, 1991, Fiske, 1992). According to each of these theories, people take concerns about loyalty to exist within the purview of morality, and loyalty operates to bind our groups together, making them more cohesive and coordinated in ways that usually facilitate group success.</p><p id="p0030">Loyalty may give rise to an expectation that people should act in ways that favor the objects of their loyalty. Indeed, this expectation for action is built into Hirschman's seminal treatise on Exit, Voice, and Loyalty (Hirschman, 1970; see also, Barry, 1974) and the Attitude-Based Framework of Loyalty (Oliver, 1999). One specific kind of action that might be expected of the loyal is that they make <em>personal sacrifices</em> for the objects of their loyalty. That is, they might be expected to act in accordance with an individual's or group's interests, even when doing so comes at a personal cost. Several operationalizations of loyalty in business ethics explicitly refer to this expectation for self-sacrifice. For example, Elegido (2013) refers to loyalty as a “deliberate commitment to further the best interests of one's employer, even when doing so may demand sacrificing some aspects of one's self-interest beyond what would be required by one's legal and other moral duties” (p. 496). Hart and Thompson (2007) account of loyalty “involve[s] self-sacrifice in the face of alternatives” (p. 300). Schrag (2001) remarks that the loyal are expected to “sacrifice convenience or immediate advantage for the sake of the person or group or organization” (p. 45) (see also, Zdaniuk &amp; Levine, 2001). Due to the inherent moral nature of loyalty, self-sacrifice for the objects of one's loyalty should be considered as the morally right thing to do. This expectation for self-sacrifice may, therefore, take the form of an obligation or imperative. Although operationalizations of loyalty often come with an expectation for self-sacrifice, there is no empirical evidence linking loyalty to an expectation for self-sacrifice. We empirically investigate whether lay people expect the loyal to self-sacrifice for the objects of their loyalty.</p><p id="p0035">Over the past few decades, many different definitions of loyalty have proliferated both within and between fields. But a necessary precondition of any definition of loyalty is that at least two objects (e.g., individuals, groups, organizations) exist, with at least one being the object of loyalty. Most definitions of loyalty also involve <em>partiality</em> (i.e., favorable bias) toward an object (Brewer &amp; Brown, 1998; Hildreth et al., 2016; Hirschman, 1970; Oliver, 1999). Accounting for the inherent moral nature of loyalty, we broadly define loyalty as the moral principle of partiality toward an object, which gives rise to expectations (or perhaps obligations or imperatives) for action on behalf of the object of loyalty (e.g., self-sacrifice). See Hildreth et al. (2016) for a similar definition of loyalty.</p></section><section id="s0015"><p id="p0040">What exactly constitutes a case of exploitation? Many (now) illegal practices are clearly exploitative (e.g., sex trafficking) to the point of being self-evident. But in other cases, what counts as exploitative might be less clear, and people often disagree over whether specific cases of worker treatment are exploitative or not (Kim, Campbell, Shepherd, &amp; Kay, 2020; Mayer, 2007; Shelby, 2002). Much of the business ethics literature adopts a fairness-based account of exploitation, according to which exploitation occurs when an agent or entity <em>takes unfair advantage of</em> another agent or entity (Snyder, 2010; Wertheimer, 1996; Zwolinski, 2012). The (un)fairness of a transaction between agents/entities is typically measured by how the <em>benefits</em> resulting from the transaction are distributed (Wertheimer, 1996). Applied to an organizational context, it would be exploitative for management, representing the organization's goals and interests, to have some workers work excessively or engage in tasks unrelated to their job duties without extra pay or tangible reward (Kim et al., 2020). In such cases, workers are not rewarded for their behavior, and management receives all the benefits. In other words, management benefits at the expense of the workers.<sup>2</sup></p><p id="p0045">One might argue that it is not truly exploitative for managers to merely ask, but not require, certain workers to work excessively or to do tasks unrelated to their job duties without extra pay or tangible rewards. If workers are only asked, and not required, to work excessively or do tasks unrelated to their job duties without extra pay or tangible reward, then employees could still freely choose whether to acquiesce. In line with Kim et al. (2020), however, we argue that when there is a significant power difference between agents/entities in a transaction, agents/entities with less power may not feel free to decline the more powerful agent/entity's request. Applied to an organizational context, management controls outcomes necessary and vital to workers (e.g., promotion, job security, health insurance (at least in the U.S.), bonuses, etc.), so workers are put in a particularly vulnerable position when asked to do extra work or do tasks unrelated to their job duties without extra pay or tangible rewards. They may feel as though they can't decline such requests from management, or else they could be harmed.</p><p id="p0050">For our series of studies, we adapted materials from Kim et al. (2020) to ensure that we capture unfair transactions between management and their workers where management reaps the benefits at the expense of the workers. We make it clear that workers who work excessively or perform uncomfortable tasks unrelated to their job duties do not receive any extra pay or tangible reward. In our cases, management benefits at the expense of workers. The cases of exploitation used in our series of studies also count as exploitation under other theoretical accounts (e.g., vulnerability-instrumentalization views; Goodin, 1985, Wood, 1995).<sup>3</sup> But, more importantly, we also pre-test the cases of exploitation used in our studies to ensure that people tend to agree, on average, that they are exploitative. What matters most for addressing our hypotheses is that lay people tend to believe these cases of poor worker treatment are exploitative – not whether some particular normative, philosophical account is right.</p></section><section id="s0020"><p id="p0055">We have now characterized the central constructs under investigation – loyalty and exploitation. But what exactly is the relationship between loyalty and exploitation? We hypothesize bidirectional causal links between loyalty and exploitation that could create a vicious circle of suffering for contemporary workers. In one direction, we hypothesize that workers with reputations for loyalty (relative to other workers without such reputations) will be perceived as more exploitable in the workplace, because of the lay assumption that loyal people are readily willing to make personal sacrifices for the objects of their loyalty. Consider a manager who wants some additional work done. The manager intends to ask a worker to stay late to do extra work and to work on some of their upcoming vacation days, but the manager isn't offering extra compensation or any other reward for that matter. The manager intends to take unfair advantage of a worker, benefitting at the expense of the worker. On our account, the manager should presume that loyal workers would be particularly likely to do this extra work and work on their vacation days, because loyalty comes with an expectation for self-sacrifice to management (or to the organization as a whole). Staying late to do extra work and working on vacation days without compensation or any other rewards are, definitionally and quintessentially, self-sacrificing behaviors. In contrast, the manager shouldn't expect disloyal workers to self-sacrifice for the manager or for the organization as a whole; it seems improbable that they would agree to engage in potentially harmful and unfair practices that predominantly benefit management and the larger organization.</p><p id="p0060">We expect to find evidence corroborating the hypothesis that workers with reputations for loyalty (relative to other workers without such reputations) will be perceived as more exploitable, because of the assumption that loyal individuals are readily willing to make personal sacrifices for the objects of their loyalty. However, there is a case to be made for the competing hypothesis: that managers would attempt to protect or reward employees for their loyalty by <em>not</em> targeting them for exploitative practices. Hiring and retaining loyal employees is highly desirable to organizations (Hirschman, 1970; McGinley &amp; Shi, 2022), as loyal employees offer numerous benefits to management and the larger organization (Hirschman, 1970; Powers, 2000; Reichheld &amp; Teal, 2001; Rosanas &amp; Velilla, 2003). If managers are interested in retaining and motivating more desirable employees, they should presumably refrain from taking unfair advantage of them in ways that could cause them to suffer. They shouldn't treat loyal employees poorly by asking them to, for example, work on their scheduled days off or work late without reward. Our studies were designed to impartially adjudicate between these competing hypotheses.</p><p id="p0065">We not only expect to find evidence for a causal link from loyalty reputation to exploitation; we also expect that workers who agree to be exploited by management (relative to workers who refuse) will obtain stronger reputations for loyalty, due to the very act of agreeing to submit to exploitative practices. When a person acts in ways indicative of them possessing some trait, then that person should gain a reputation for possessing that trait (assuming others were exposed to the person's actions; Emler, 1990). So, when a person acts in ways that are indicative of loyalty toward some object and when other people see those actions, that person should acquire a reputation for being loyal. Consider a worker who has agreed to poor treatment in several ways over time: they have agreed to work late on several occasions and on many of their vacation days for no rewards. These are actions that are indicative of loyalty to management; they show partiality toward management at personal cost. The worker should, therefore, gain a reputation for loyalty.</p><p id="p0070">Despite the now considerable literature detailing positive outcomes of loyalty and negative outcomes of disloyalty (Haidt, 2003; Hirschman, 1970; Kruger, 2021; Powers, 2000; Reichheld &amp; Teal, 2001; Rosanas &amp; Velilla, 2003), evidence in favor of our hypotheses would suggest that those who seem loyal are more likely to suffer potentially harmful and unfair treatment in the workplace. Such evidence would call into question the value of loyalty, at least for certain individuals in certain contexts.</p></section><section id="s0025"><p id="p0075">Across four studies, we investigate whether loyal employees are selectively and ironically targeted by managers for exploitation in hypothetical scenarios, whether this targeting of loyal workers for exploitation is mediated by the expectation that loyal individuals are readily willing to make personal sacrifices for the objects of their loyalty, and whether those who agree (versus refuse) to be exploited in the workplace acquire stronger reputations for loyalty. To start, in Study 1, participants were presented with a worker who had acquired a reputation for loyalty, disloyalty, or neither loyalty nor disloyalty. We test whether managers express greater willingness to ask workers with a reputation for loyalty to be exploited than workers without such a reputation. Study 1 also probes mechanism, testing whether managers are more willing to ask loyal employees to be exploited because of the assumption that loyal people are readily willing to make personal sacrifices for the objects of their loyalty.</p><p id="p0080">Study 2 then tests for specificity of process. We do not expect a reputation for possessing just any moral virtue to encourage targeting for exploitation. Instead, we expect loyalty to be unique among moral virtues insofar as a reputation for loyalty (as opposed to other moral virtues) is what encourages managers to target workers for exploitation. To offer some evidence that loyalty is unique, we compare loyalty to two other common moral virtues that people usually value and aspire to exemplify – fairness and honesty. Loyalty, fairness, and honesty are all closely related moral virtues. Based on evidence coalesced across 20 countries, loyalty, fairness, and honesty all appear in Schwartz (1992) universal psychological structure of human values, with loyalty and honesty in the same value cluster of Benevolence and with fairness in the closely related neighboring cluster of Universalism. In addition, research and theory on moral identity and the self-concept consider virtues like loyalty, fairness, and honesty to be closely interconnected (Hildreth et al., 2016; Kihlstrom &amp; Klein, 1994) and central in people's constructed self-concepts (Aquino &amp; Reed II, 2002; Stanley &amp; De Brigard, 2019).</p><p id="p0085">Studies 3 and 4 reverse the causal pathway from loyalty reputation to exploitation, testing whether workers who agree (versus refuse) to be exploited are seen as more loyal in the eyes of managers. Assessing bidirectional causal links between loyal reputation and exploitation is important because evidence in favor of bidirectional causal links could be indicative of a vicious circle of harm and suffering for workers. Study 4 also tests whether the certainty with which managers believe that a case of poor worker treatment is exploitative predicts their judgments about the loyalty of employees who agree to be treated poorly. We expect that the more certain managers are that a practice is exploitative, the more loyal they will judge employees who agree to this poor treatment.</p></section><section id="s0030"><p id="p0090">For all studies, we report all exclusion criteria, all materials and conditions included, and all independent and dependent measures. We ensured ample power across studies by seeking at least 100 participants per condition after expected exclusions. In each study, the sample size was determined before any data analysis. To best address our hypotheses, we recruited samples of managers with at least one year of experience. These managers were not permitted to access more than one study. Studies 1, 2, and 4 were all formally pre-registered, and we did not deviate from these pre-registrations.

<section>
    <p>
        Flawless is an execution engine for durable computation. It will run your code until completion
        even <span>in the presence of hardware or software failure<span>.
    </span></span></p>
    <p>
        We aspire to allow <b>builders</b> to create amazing experiences for others. And the best user
        experiences require complex UIs holding complex state, but trying to model all the state inside
        your database can be challenging. At the same time, you don't want the user to lose progress by
        accidentally refreshing the page, making continues persistence a
        requirement for modern applications.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>
            Flawless allows you to model this persistent state with just code and local variables, raising
            the bar when it comes to expressing complex behaviors inside applications.</span>
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>How does it work?</h2>

    <p>
        Workflows in flawless are written in <b>Rust</b>, in fact they are just regular Rust functions.
        This means that they can contain arbitrary logic. But instead of native code, the functions
        are compiled to WebAssembly and executed in a completely deterministic environment. The only
        nondeterminism is introduced when interacting with the "real world", like performing HTTP requests
        or generating random numbers. WebAssembly requires us to explicitly handle the non-deterministic
        execution.
    </p>
    <p>
        We use that knowledge to persist a log of non-deterministic side effects. This means that if
        the execution of a workflow is ever interrupted, we can just re-run it and catch up to the same
        state without the need to perform the side effects again.
    </p>

        &gt;
    </p>
    <p>▓———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————█</p>
</div>



    <p>
        This makes the amount of data we need to persist minimal, and the rest is just re-calculated
        on-demand in case of failure. A nice side effect of this model is that the whole system is
        observable. We can take any finished or still running workflow and analyze the exact execution
        path it took to get into the current state. With a completely deterministic execution environment,
        impossible to reproduce bugs become a problem of the past.
    </p>
    <p>
        Notice how flawless takes away the burden of persisting the state. You just write business logic
        and can be assured that all the actions are going to run until completion, even if you need to
        occasionally restart the server because of maintenance. Once you start the flawless engine back
        up, <span>the workflows are going to seamlessly continue executing from where
            they stopped</span>.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.daemonology.net/blog/2023-10-25-2%5E18-dollars-to-open-source.html">https://www.daemonology.net/blog/2023-10-25-2%5E18-dollars-to-open-source.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38010244">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>
Yesterday I read a great article from Sentry entitled
<a href="https://blog.sentry.io/we-just-gave-500-000-dollars-to-open-source-maintainers/">"We
Just Gave $500,000 to Open Source Maintainers"</a>, and it made me wonder
just how much <a href="https://www.tarsnap.com/">Tarsnap</a> had spent
on supporting open source software over the years.  Ever since
<a href="https://www.daemonology.net/blog/2009-12.html">December 2009</a>
Tarsnap has spent 100% of its December operating profits on supporting
open source software — which, since needs for support aren't limited
to December, means that Tarsnap hands out money throughout the year, and
at the end of the year (when I know how much profit Tarsnap made in
December) I send whatever is left in the "budget" to the
<a href="https://freebsdfoundation.org/">FreeBSD Foundation</a>.
Going through 14 years of accounting spreadsheets brought me to a total
of $274,482 — or in binary terms, slightly over 2^18 USD.
</p><p>
The largest recipient of this funding every year has been the FreeBSD
Foundation, and to date they have received $173,920.  It's hard to
overstate the importance of the work the Foundation does; they provide
hardware which keeps the FreeBSD project running, they fund a myriad
of independent projects, and they have full-time developers who get
thrown in to fixing whatever needs to be fixed from time to time.
While FreeBSD is unusual among open source projects in that the FreeBSD
project governance is entirely independent of the FreeBSD Foundation,
the FreeBSD project would be immeasurably worse off without the support
of the FreeBSD Foundation.
</p><p>
The second largest recipient of support from Tarsnap has been the
<a href="https://www.bsdnow.tv/">BSD Now</a> podcast, which has received
$47,500 to date.  Now at their 529th episode, they fill an important
niche in the BSD world, being one of the only places people can hear
what's going on across all the BSD operating systems.  As developers,
we're generally lousy at communication, and while technical journalists
(e.g., Phoronix) sometimes report on things happening in the BSD world,
they generally lack the technical knowledge to be consistently accurate.
BSD Now, being produced by <i>actual developers</i>, bridges the two
solitudes.
</p><p>
Third comes <a href="https://www.bsdcan.org/">BSDCan</a>, which has
received $23,188 to date.  In addition to being in Canada — which,
as a Canadian, I have to admit influences me somewhat — BSDCan is
the largest BSD conference in the world and plays an essential role in
bringing together developers to discuss and learn about each others'
work.  Email and IRC are great, but sometimes face-to-face conversations
make a huge difference.
</p><p>
Next comes the annual FreeBSD developer summits held at BSDCan.  These
"piggy back" on BSDCan in the sense that they can take advantage of the
fact that BSDCan is already getting a lot of people to travel to one
spot — but BSDCan does not pay for the rooms, A/V, coffee, or any
of the other miscellaneous costs associated with running a developer
summit.  Tarsnap has contributed $11,062 to those.
</p><p>
While most of the money Tarsnap contributes to open source software is
focused on the BSD world — that's what Tarsnap uses — it does
provide funding for an
<a href="https://awards-search.sfu.ca/Home/AwardDetail/72006">annual
award</a> at my Alma Mater for students who contribute to open source
software.  To date Tarsnap has contributed $7,839 to this.
</p><p>
Finally there's a bunch of miscellaneous sponsorships — conferences,
developers, travel grants, etc. — adding up to $10,972.  (Or maybe
a bit more; there were a lot of these and I might have missed some while
I was putting together my list.)
</p><p>
Tarsnap's 2^18 USD of financial support for open source software over the
past 14 years is only a drop in the bucket compared to what is needed, and
indeed I wish we could contribute more; Tarsnap would not exist without
all of the open source software if runs on.  On the other hand, maybe it's
not a bad total for a two-person company; there are certainly much larger
companies which contribute far less.
</p><p>
If you're at a startup which relies heavily on open source software, please
take a moment to ask yourself: How much does your company contribute back?

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I wanted to write a fun little experimental ActivityPub server. I have a solid idea how to handle this in go, or at least I think I do, so that’d be pretty boring. Instead, let’s try a new technology.</p><p>I settled on <a href="https://www.swift.org/server/">swift, a general-purpose programming language built using a modern approach to safety, performance, and software design patterns, to create the best available language for uses ranging from systems programming, to mobile and desktop apps, scaling up to cloud services</a>.</p><p>This worked until it didn’t. Here are some incomplete notes on the experience, and some extrapolated thoughts on how things may have gone.<br></p><h3>intro</h3><p>Swift seems like a nice language to program in. I don’t think many people think of it as their first choice for a project running on linux, but that’s what made it interesting. I do like that it’s compiled, supposedly runs efficiently, and takes a modern approach to modularity.</p><p>ActivityPub requires a web server that parses incoming json requests, and sends out its own requests. There are some libraries available for swift to make all this possible, so I should just plug it all together, and then write some logic for request handling.</p><p>To get started, I used <a href="https://vapor.codes/">vapor, the future of web development</a>.<br></p><h3>first build</h3><p>I’ve got the hello world web app created with <i>vapor new</i>. Time to run <i>swift build</i>. This goes on <i>forever</i>. Then it stops.</p><p>I’ve lost the original error message, but it was because the c++ <code>&lt;memory&gt;</code> header couldn’t be found compiling some BoringSSL code. This was my fault, for installing the g++ package, but not the g++-dev package or whatever, but it raises the bigger question of why are we compiling BoringSSL in the first place?</p><p>Swift was sold to me as a safe language. But I think it would be more accurate to describe it as a thin veneer of safety over a deep pit of peril. The linux version of swift replicates a large number of native mac frameworks using whatever mix of C and C++ gets the job done. (On mac, these frameworks are also written in c++ or obj-c or something, by Apple, who may be slowly rewriting them in swift, but certainly isn’t done.)</p><p>This is troubling because I have no idea what version of BoringSSL is included here, or what its update policy is. I can imagine that vapor also includes a middleware layer that automagically transcodes images using a broken libwebp. I don’t think it does, but it’s the future of web development, so who even knows. Regardless of specifics, there’s a large iceberg of code here, that could be outdated or vulnerable.</p><p>Spot check: <a href="https://github.com/vapor/vapor/pull/3038/commits/ce62ebe8c1ae2843986a70cddef961c045c9e3b4">vapor updated async-http-client</a> on 2023-07-28 from 1.10.0 to 1.18.0. A review of <a href="https://github.com/swift-server/async-http-client/releases">async-http-client releases</a> shows 1.10.0 was released 2022-04-27 and 1.18.0 on 2023-05-22, and there’s a few concerning issues in the intervening releases.</p><p>Back to building hello, I installed the necessary headers, and finish. A complete build takes about five minutes on my laptop. This is not one time, but actually recurs, but we’ll get to that. Incremental builds of small changes are pretty fast, a few seconds.</p><pre><code>real    4m44.354s
user    22m35.414s
sys     0m55.632s</code></pre><h3>package.swift</h3><p>The weirdest thing about swift is it records dependencies in a file called <i>Package.swift</i>. And then <i>swift build</i> interprets this file somehow? Cool, but also janky? I’ve seen people do this with lua (which looks a lot like json), but swift is kinda syntax heavy for this purpose.</p><pre><code>    targets: [
        .executableTarget(
            name: "App",
            dependencies: [
                .product(name: "Leaf", package: "leaf"),
                .product(name: "Vapor", package: "vapor")
            ]
        ),</code></pre><p>Another issue I did not quite sort out, simply due to unfamiliarity, is how this file relates to <i>import</i> statements in my code. Like there’s an equivalence to <span>CFLAGS</span> and <span>LDFLAGS</span>, but it’s not what I expected, and I was quite surprised by a few things.<br></p><h3>sometimes super reliable</h3><p>I’ve got my hello world app built, run it a few times, make some changes to have it say hello tedu, the usual kicking the tires. Seems quite reliable, but I notice that sometimes it’s <i>super</i> reliable. As in, hitting ^C doesn’t kill the process about one time in ten. The server keeps running, keeps serving requests. It’s an immortal web juggernaut. The only way to stop it is kill -9.</p><p>A hard to kill web server sounds like a feature, but sometimes we can have too much of a good thing. During development, I’d actually like the server to be easy to kill and restart.</p><p>The fact that this occurs only one time in ten makes me think it’s a bug, and not by design. (Unless it’s buggy 90% of the time.) I did not investigate further because signal races are not my idea of a good time. Not a good omen, either.<br></p><h3>blast from the past</h3><p>I started with vapor, but the project I had in mind needed some lower level access to http requests, so I went searching for an example server that used <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-nio">SwiftNIO</a>. Start integrating some code and immediately get compiler errors.</p><pre><code>     .childChannelInitializer { channel in
<span>-        channel.pipeline.configureHTTPServerPipeline().then {</span>
<span>+        channel.pipeline.configureHTTPServerPipeline().flatMap { () in</span>
             channel.pipeline.addHandler(myHandler)
         }
     }</code></pre><p>Why? I think it’s weird that swift programmers consider this an improvement in legibility, and even more that this is such an improvement it’s worth making a breaking change for.</p><p>There are dozens of such little changes required, and I guess if you’ve been following swift from day one, you’re on top of such things, but as somebody new to swift, having to speedrun the whole experience represents an unfriendly learning curve. The NIO library is complicated enough I don’t think I would have figured out how to wire it up based solely on reading the documentation, hence the reliance on found samples.</p><p>Whenever a new language or framework comes out, people rush to try it, and github and stackoverflow and everywhere else is immediately filled with code samples that work with 1.0. But none of that info gets garbage collected when it becomes outdated, and people write fewer examples for new code, and the new samples have less link juice, with the result that the answers you seek are not the answers you find.<br></p><h3>everything everywhere</h3><p>Here’s another example that was pretty simple but taught me another quirk about swift.</p><pre><code>     func handlerAdded(ctx: ChannelHandlerContext) {
         self.buffer = ctx.channel.allocator.buffer(capacity: 128)
<span>-        self.buffer.write(staticString: "it works!")</span>
<span>+        self.buffer.writeStaticString("it works!")</span>
     }</code></pre><p>Yeah, sure, explicit method names are better than one method with many parameters. But now look at the compiler error.</p><pre><code>error: incorrect argument label in call (have 'staticstring:', expected 'http2ErrorCode:')
        self.buffer.write(staticstring: "it works!")
                         ^~~~~~~~~~~~~
                          http2ErrorCode</code></pre><p>http2 what? Nowhere in my code was I doing anything with http/2. Not intentionally.</p><p>Turns out that swift allows adding extension methods to classes in other modules. Okay, cool feature if you ask for it, but confusing if you haven’t. Unlike dynamic languages such as ruby, where monkey patched methods are of course globally visible, swift is statically compiled. The compiler should know which extensions I’ve asked for and which I haven’t. Long ago, I worked on a complicated c++ code base with tons of operator overloads, and you can get some pretty surprising compiler errors if you have operator, in scope. The solution is you put the damn thing in a separate header, and then it doesn’t show up except in the code that asks for it.</p><p>You can see the implementation of this extension in <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-nio-http2/blob/main/Sources/NIOHTTP2/HTTP2ErrorCode.swift">the source for HTTP2ErrorCode</a>. But it appears in neither <a href="https://swiftpackageindex.com/apple/swift-nio-http2/1.27.0/documentation/niohttp2/http2errorcode">the documentation for HTTP2ErrorCode</a> nor <a href="https://swiftpackageindex.com/apple/swift-nio/main/documentation/niocore/bytebuffer">the documentation for ByteBuffer</a>. I’m not sure how I would discover this method in the event that I <i>did</i> want to use it. I’ve been told the documentation simply needs to be rebuilt with the new version of DocC, but at the time of writing, that has not happened.</p><p>I do find it amusing that the http/1 team felt the need to clean up these <i>write</i> methods, but the http/2 team didn’t get the memo or felt it wasn’t worth the bother. I’m not sure how this scales in a larger project. You use a component, they remove or rename a method, so then you just add it back? And bizarrely, due to the way extensions become globally imported, it may be some invisible dependency you’re using, leaving you unaware you’re using an obsolete method. This seems very likely to lead to chaos.<br></p><h3>builds</h3><p>After building your hello world app, you get a build directory full of artifacts. This is for a web app that prints hello on port 8080.</p><pre><code>176M    .build/repositories
355M    .build/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/debug
250M    .build/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/release
924M    total</code></pre><p>These are not portable, however. As in, you cannot relocate them. Or copy them. Should you dare to do so, the compiler will vomit.</p><pre><code>error: PCH was compiled with module cache path '/home/tedu/proj/swello/.build/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/debug/ModuleCache/2U5BFZYJRSGKH', but the path is currently '/home/tedu/proj/swift/swello/.build/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/debug/ModuleCache/2U5BFZYJRSGKH'</code></pre><p>I am a bad developer who likes to hold things wrong, so the way I develop features is usually to create proj-feature1 and proj-feature2 directories. This is easier for my tiny brain to reason about than smashing all the features into branches in a single directory. And in the situation where I’m developing a server that talks to other servers, it even lets me see what happens when new code talks to old code. But this requires a full rebuild, which takes long enough rebuilding all that BoringSSL code that it would be a big help to also copy the build directory. Alas, that is forbidden.</p><p>I once heard a rumor that there is a secret flag to let swift share build directories, but I was unable to find existence of such, so it may just be an urban legend.<br></p><h3>illegal instruction</h3><p>You know what else is illegal? The instructions generated by the swift compiler.</p><p>I made a fairly small change, to change a get route to a post route, and upon hitting that route with curl was greeted with a special treat.</p><pre><code>Illegal instruction (core dumped)</code></pre><p>This is where my swift journey ends. I’m not debugging this. I’m not working around it. I’m giving up.</p><p>I cannot rule out the possibility that this is somehow my fault, since I don’t know swift that well, or at all really, so maybe this is just what happens when you forget to call <i>await</i> or something like that. But if that’s the case, this is an unfriendly failure mode for a supposedly modern safe language.<br></p><h3>language</h3><p>Anachronistic ecosystem aside, working with swift was fairly pleasant. I wrote some code in a fairly obvious way, the compiler compiled it, and then it ran as expected (usually). Once I figured out the correct names of the methods I wanted, the compiler was not overly fussy. I think I would have been happy to advance to the level of competent swift developer.</p><p>I got a lot done without spending all my time worrying about error handling, although I have the sinking suspicion that’s because the code doesn’t handle errors, not that the magic error elves are doing it for me. Memory management seemed easy and complete, as advertised. I did not make it far enough to assess how terrifying it is to debug an asynchronous concurrency bug.</p><p>I’m pretty sure one of the swift designers was scarred by working on a huge java swing application in a past life, because the language puts a lot of emphasis on making it very easy to call little anonymous functions. I too remember the dark days of new ActionListener. Mixed thoughts on this. It helps reduce clutter, and I think it’s a great way to add a little bit of logic to constructors, etc. without making them super complicated. Except we have all this async code in the mix. I can’t tell what’s a for loop and what’s a callback, and what’s going to run now and what’s going to run later. In your own code, I’m sure you learn what’s what, but reading a new code base will require a lot of documentation consultation.<br></p><h3>thoughts</h3><p>I certainly can’t recommend swift based on my experience. I don’t know if I can recommend against it based on such a short trial. Several of my frustrations were definitely newb pains, and may not have even been worthy of mention given more time.</p><p>My concern using it for any other project would be the big iceberg of code that’s not swift. That doesn’t appear to be going away anytime soon.</p><p>The combination of the signal handling and illegal instruction is also more than a little problematic. If you wanted to make a serious try at swift, you’d want a plan to deal with that. The vapor website is very pretty, so I’m sure somebody has used swift to do something fun at some point. That somebody just wasn’t me.</p><p>I wonder if <a href="https://danluu.com/everything-is-broken/">Dan Luu</a> has ever tried swift.

      <article role="main">
        <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>I’ve been working quite with files and file systems on Linux recently.
Mostly from the vantage point of either a shell or a python script. I
wanted to practice coding against the Linux API, so I cracked open my
copy of <a href="https://man7.org/tlpi/">the Linux Programming Interface</a> to
see if I could find some useful info. As usual, I found myself on an
enjoyable tangent learning about file system and process fundamentals.</p>
<p>I developed a fairly simple goal for a small project over the weekend:
pick some essential aspect of Linux file systems and learn a bit about
it. Specifically, try to use the Linux API directly or at least
understand what parts of the API are being used by whatever script is
being used to get the job done.</p>
<p>The task I eventually settled on is described as a simple exercise in
the book mentioned above. Write a program that prints a list of all
processes running on the system that are associated with a specific
user. Print the pid and name of the program being run. It’s possible to
glean all of this information from the <code>/proc</code> file system. The file
<code>/proc/$pid/status</code> holds the info about uid and program name.</p>
<p>The general plan:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write a quick script in python to do the job</li>
<li>Run the script using strace to see what system calls are being made</li>
<li>Write a program in c to do the same job but use the API directly</li>
<li>Run the program through strace and compare the footprint</li>
<li>Profile both programs</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="python-script">Python script</h2>
<p>The initial script is very straight forward. Is relies on the <code>os</code>
module and the <code>pathlib.Path</code> class to get the uid, list the pids of all
processes being run. It then opens the <code>/proc/$pid/status</code> file for each process
and reads two lines; the first to get the name of the program being run and the
ninth to get the uid.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I found it quite beneficial to sketch out a working program like this. It didn’t
take more than a couple of minutes to get it working and it made it possible to
think of ways to improve the program for the second iteration.</p>
<h2 id="strace-output">Strace output</h2>
<p>The first thing that I went looking for in the strace output was which
system calls get used to list the contents of a directory. In the python
code the <code>Path.glob("*")</code> function is being used to list everything
in the <code>proc</code> directory. The listing happens over the course of three
system calls, lines 912-914 below. Note that these calls are lower level
than anything we would use directly from a C program. The directory is
first opened, then <code>fstatat</code> is called to get the <code>stat</code> structure for
the directory. The call to <code>openat</code> returns the file descriptor for the
directory. This is then passed as the first argument to the 4 following
function calls lines 913-916 below. The hex value is the address of the
directory, this is passed along with the <code>st_size</code> attribute to the
<code>getdents64</code> system call.</p>
<p>One curious part of the system calls generated by the python code is that is
seems to call <code>newfstatat</code> and <code>getents64</code> again with an empty string. I wonder
if this might be some side-effect of the use of the <code>Path.glob</code> function. Which
would imply inclusion of the empty directory?</p>
<p>One moderately thing that occurred to me after writing the initial
python program was that it’s not necessary to read the <code>uid</code> line of the
<code>/proc/$PID/status</code> file. An <code>fstat</code> call using the file descriptor is
enough to glean this info.</p>

costs practically the same as running the program itself. Strace generated over
3000 lines of output. The C version used about half the number of system calls.
The really major difference is the absence of the virtual machine.</p>

<pre tabindex="0"><code>cmd: nvim, pid: 306559

this is happening and it also appears to be causing an error. As far as
I understand, the ioctl call signifies that the program is trying to do

we’re now at a much higher increment of file descriptor. This is because
of the way the program’s loop is running. We’re not closing files after
we’re finishing them, instead we’re just letting this happen implicitly
on program exit. There is also no <code>lseek</code> operation as there way in the
python code. The file pointer is at byte zero on opening the file, so
I don’t really understand why the python version is calling lseek to
reposition it at the beginning of the file.</p>

<p>The listing for the C code is included below. I definitely don’t have
as much practice writing C as python. I try to pick up good habits when
I see them. There are some good online resources for this, like <a href="https://nullprogram.com/">Chris
Wellons’</a> website.</p>
<p>The only real overhead to speak of in the C version is linking a few
libraries at the top of the program. I’m using a custom function for
reading lines from a file.</p>

<p>Okay, so this section started off as a kind of a joke, I ran both
programs using the <code>time</code> command on Linux. They run so quickly, it’s
a bit hard to determine (but not that hard to guess) which one runs
faster. As mentioned above, there is a huge overhead in running a python
interpreter. As much as I love python the language for it’s simple,
readable syntax and just how accessible that makes it as a programming
language, I do wonder from time to if life would be any different if I
wasn’t lugging a python interpreter everywhere.</p>

was easy to generate some useful information about the two programs.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



<p>30th September 2023</p>

<p>I build a lot of command-line tools in Python. It’s become my favorite way of quickly turning a piece of code into something I can use myself and package up for other people to use too.</p>
<p>My biggest CLI  projects are <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/">sqlite-utils</a>, <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a>, <a href="https://shot-scraper.datasette.io/en/stable/">shot-scraper</a> and <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a>—but I have dozens of others and I build new ones at the rate of at least one a month. A fun recent example is <a href="https://github.com/simonw/blip-caption">blip-caption</a>, a tiny CLI wrapper around the Salesforce BLIP model that can generate usable captions for image files.</p>
<p>Here are some notes on what I’ve learned about designing and implementing CLI tools in Python so far.</p>
<h4 id="starting-with-a-template">Starting with a template</h4>
<p>I build enough CLI apps that I developed my own <a href="https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter">Cookiecutter</a> template for starting new ones.</p>
<p>That template is <a href="https://github.com/simonw/click-app">simonw/click-app</a>. You can create a new application from that template directly on GitHub, too—I wrote more about that in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Aug/28/dynamic-github-repository-templates/">Dynamic content for GitHub repository templates using cookiecutter and GitHub Actions</a>.</p>
<h4 id="arguments-options-and-conventions">Arguments, options and conventions</h4>
<p>Almost all of my tools are built using the <a href="https://click.palletsprojects.com/">Click</a> Python library. Click encourages a specific way of designing CLI tools which I really like—I find myself annoyed at the various tools from other ecosystems that don’t stick to the conventions that Click encourages.</p>
<p>I’ll try to summarize those conventions here.</p>
<ul>
<li>Commands have arguments and options. Arguments are positional—they are strings that you pass directly to the command, like <code>data.db</code> in <code>datasette data.db</code>. Arguments can be required or optional, and you can have commands which accept an unlimited number of arguments.</li>
<li>Options are, usually, optional. They are things like <code>--port 8000</code>. Options can also have a single character shortened version, such as <code>-p 8000</code>.
<ul>
<li>Very occasionally I’ll create an option that is required, usually because a command has so many positional arguments that forcing an option makes its usage easier to read.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some options are flags—they don’t take any additional parameters, they just switch something on. <code>shot-scraper --retina</code> is an example of this.</li>
<li>Flags with single character shortcuts can be easily combined—<code>symbex -in fetch_data</code> is short for <code>symbex --imports --no-file fetch_data</code> <a href="https://github.com/simonw/symbex/blob/1.4/README.md#usage">for example</a>.</li>
<li>Some options take multiple parameters. <code>datasette --setting sql_time_limit_ms 10000</code> is an example, taking both the name of the setting and the value it should be set to.</li>
<li>Commands can have sub-commands, each with their own family of commands. <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/templates.html">llm templates</a> is an example of this, with <code>llm templates list</code> and <code>llm templates show</code> and <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/help.html#llm-templates-help">several more</a>.</li>
<li>Every command should have help text—the more detailed the better. This can be viewed by running <code>llm --help</code>—or for sub-commands, <code>llm templates --help</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Click makes it absurdly easy and productive to build CLI tools that follow these conventions.</p>
<h4 id="consistency-is-everything">Consistency is everything</h4>
<p>As CLI utilities get larger, they can end up with a growing number of commands and options.</p>
<p>The most important thing in designing these is <em>consistency</em> with other existing commands and options (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/160#issuecomment-1682995315">example here</a>)—and with related tools that your user may have used before.</p>
<p>I often turn to GPT-4 for help with this: I’ll ask it for examples of existing CLI tools that do something similar to what I’m about to build, and see if there’s anything in their option design that I can emulate.</p>
<p>Since my various projects are designed to complement each other I try to stay consistent between them as well—I’ll often post an issue comment that says “similar to functionality in X”, with a copy of the <code>--help</code> output for the tool I’m about to imitate.</p>
<h4 id="cli-interfaces-are-an-api---version-appropriately">CLI interfaces are an API—version appropriately</h4>
<p>I try to stick to <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a> for my projects, bumping the major version number on breaking changes and the minor version number for new features.</p>
<p>The command-line interface to a tool is absolutely part of that documented API. If someone writes a Bash script or a GitHub Actions automation that uses one of my tools, I’m cautious to avoid breaking that without bumping my major version number.</p>
<h4 id="include-usage-examples-in---help">Include usage examples in --help</h4>
<p>A habit I’ve formed more recently is trying to always including a working example of the command in the <code>--help</code> for that command.</p>
<p>I find I use this a lot for tools I’ve developed myself. All of my tools have extensive online documentation, but I like to be able to consult <code>--help</code> without opening a browser for most of their functionality.</p>
<p>Here’s one of my more involved examples—the help for the <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/cli.html#converting-data-in-columns">sqlite-utils convert</a> command:</p>
<pre><code>Usage: sqlite-utils convert [OPTIONS] DB_PATH TABLE COLUMNS... CODE

  Convert columns using Python code you supply. For example:

      sqlite-utils convert my.db mytable mycolumn \
          '"\n".join(textwrap.wrap(value, 10))' \
          --import=textwrap

  "value" is a variable with the column value to be converted.

  Use "-" for CODE to read Python code from standard input.

  The following common operations are available as recipe functions:

  r.jsonsplit(value, delimiter=',', type=&lt;class 'str'&gt;)

      Convert a string like a,b,c into a JSON array ["a", "b", "c"]

  r.parsedate(value, dayfirst=False, yearfirst=False, errors=None)

      Parse a date and convert it to ISO date format: yyyy-mm-dd
      
      - dayfirst=True: treat xx as the day in xx/yy/zz
      - yearfirst=True: treat xx as the year in xx/yy/zz
      - errors=r.IGNORE to ignore values that cannot be parsed
      - errors=r.SET_NULL to set values that cannot be parsed to null

  r.parsedatetime(value, dayfirst=False, yearfirst=False, errors=None)

      Parse a datetime and convert it to ISO datetime format: yyyy-mm-ddTHH:MM:SS
      
      - dayfirst=True: treat xx as the day in xx/yy/zz
      - yearfirst=True: treat xx as the year in xx/yy/zz
      - errors=r.IGNORE to ignore values that cannot be parsed
      - errors=r.SET_NULL to set values that cannot be parsed to null

  You can use these recipes like so:

      sqlite-utils convert my.db mytable mycolumn \
          'r.jsonsplit(value, delimiter=":")'

Options:
  --import TEXT                   Python modules to import
  --dry-run                       Show results of running this against first
                                  10 rows
  --multi                         Populate columns for keys in returned
                                  dictionary
  --where TEXT                    Optional where clause
  -p, --param &lt;TEXT TEXT&gt;...      Named :parameters for where clause
  --output TEXT                   Optional separate column to populate with
                                  the output
  --output-type [integer|float|blob|text]
                                  Column type to use for the output column
  --drop                          Drop original column afterwards
  --no-skip-false                 Don't skip falsey values
  -s, --silent                    Don't show a progress bar
  --pdb                           Open pdb debugger on first error
  -h, --help                      Show this message and exit.
</code></pre>
<h4 id="including---help-in-the-online-documentation">Including --help in the online documentation</h4>
<p>My larger tools tend to have extensive documentation independently of their help output. I update this documentation at the same time as the implementation and the tests, as described in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Oct/29/the-perfect-commit/">The Perfect Commit</a>.</p>
<p>I like to include the <code>--help</code> output in my documentation sites as well. This is mainly for my own purposes—having the help visible on a web page makes it much easier to review it and spot anything that needs updating.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
							
							<p>Some long-anticipated updates landed in October, making MAME&nbsp;0.260 a
							very exciting release!  Firstly, there are some general updates to MAME
							itself.  After a few false starts, MAME now supports bgfx video output
							with Wayland on Linux.  As requested by users, you can finally use delta
							CHD files for clone systems and software items.  This allows for major
							disk space savings in some cases when you have multiple versions of a
							system or software item.  There’s also an updated version of PortAudio
							included.</p>
							
							<p>Two very different systems from Casio have been promoted to working
							this month.  The first is the CZ-101 compact keyboard synthesiser.  It
							used Phase Distortion Synthesis, which was Casio’s patent-avoiding
							answer to Yamaha’s DX series.  To help you load patches, MAME can now
							feed SysEx files to emulated MIDI input ports. The other is the Loopy,
							a game console released exclusively in Japan and marketed primarily to
							girls.  While sound output, the sticker printer, and the frame grabber
							accessory are not emulated (yet), you can try out the system’s entire
							library of eleven software titles.</p>
							
							<p>Several Korean arcade games were added this month, including a
							Solitaire card game from F2&nbsp;System that uses a dedicated control panel
							and features some rather disturbing pre-rendered 3D animations.  A few
							Merit games were added as well.  Other improvements include more
							emulated NuBus and PDS cards for Macs, Cumana&nbsp;DFS disk image support for
							the Acorn Electron, and support for an MSX Flash cartridge.</p>
							
							<p>That’s all we’ve got time to highlight here, but of course there’s
							much more.  You can read about everything that was updated this month in
							the <a href="https://www.mamedev.org/releases/whatsnew_0260.txt">whatsnew.txt
							file</a>.  Source code and 64-bit Windows binary packages are available
							from <a href="https://www.mamedev.org/release.html">the download
							page</a>.</p>

<p>Microsoft is making some interesting (and potentially controversial) moves to try and encourage users to its browser, Edge, instead of its arch-rival Google Chrome. If you want to download the installer for Google Chrome using Edge (which is the only web browser pre-installed in Windows 10 and <a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/windows-11" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/tag/windows-11">Windows 11</a>), Microsoft now apparently demands to know why in a poll.&nbsp;</p><p>If you use Edge for any browsing, you’ll probably have noticed that <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/microsoft-edge-is-bombarding-people-with-ads" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/news/microsoft-edge-is-bombarding-people-with-ads">it’s already peppered with ads, banners, and pop-ups</a> to urge you to keep Edge as your default browser, and it looks like <a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/microsoft" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/tag/microsoft">Microsoft</a> thinks it’s not been putting enough pressure on its users.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-now-wants-you-to-take-a-poll-before-installing-google-chrome/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-now-wants-you-to-take-a-poll-before-installing-google-chrome/">NeoWin made the discovery</a> when trying to download Chrome while using Microsoft Edge. When users open and wait for the Chrome download to begin, Microsoft opens a sidebar and presents users with a poll that interrogates users on why they think they need another browser.

<p>A <b>Judas goat</b> is a trained <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goat" title="Goat">goat</a> used in general animal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herding" title="Herding">herding</a>. The Judas goat is trained to associate with sheep or cattle, leading them to a specific destination. In stockyards, a Judas goat will lead sheep to slaughter,<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> while its own life is spared. Judas goats are also used to lead other animals to specific pens and onto trucks. They have fallen out of use in recent times,<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (September 2020)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> but can still be found in various smaller slaughterhouses in some parts of the world, as well as conservation projects.<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>
</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle#Domestication_and_husbandry" title="Cattle">Cattle herders</a> may use a Judas steer to serve the same purpose as a Judas goat. The technique, and the term, originated from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle_drives_in_the_United_States" title="Cattle drives in the United States">cattle drives in the United States</a> in the 1800s.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Kacirk2005_4-0"><a href="#cite_note-Kacirk2005-4">[4]</a></sup>
</p><p>The term is a reference to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judas_Iscariot" title="Judas Iscariot">Judas Iscariot</a>, an apostle of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus" title="Jesus">Jesus Christ</a> who betrayed Jesus according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Testament" title="New Testament">New Testament</a>.

<p>The phrase has also been used to describe a goat that is used to find <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feral_goat" title="Feral goat">feral goats</a> that are targeted for eradication. The Judas goat is usually sterilised, outfitted with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmitter" title="Transmitter">transmitter</a>, painted in red and then released. The goat then finds the remaining herds of feral goats, allowing hunters to exterminate them.<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> The podcast <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiolab" title="Radiolab">Radiolab</a></i> dedicated a portion of its episode on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gal%C3%A1pagos_Islands" title="Galápagos Islands">Galápagos Islands</a> to how feral goats affected the environment on the islands and how Judas goats were used to help return the islands to nature.<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>  This technique is now used to target other invasive species, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camels_in_Australia" title="Camels in Australia">camels in Australia</a>, pigs in America, rats in Mexico and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raccoon_dog" title="Raccoon dog">raccoon dogs</a> in Europe.<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>

Some feral goats were able to find cover in the rugged terrain and eradication efforts were hindered by frequent naval bombardment operations. Between 1989 and 1991, a dozen radio-collared Judas goats were used on the island to locate the remaining feral goats. 263 goats were killed.<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>“Nothing is permanent. Everything changes. That’s the one thing we know for sure in this world,” Calvin says to Hobbes in the first panel of a two-panel strip that ran in more than two thousand newspapers on Monday, July 17, 1995. The two friends are in a wagon, plummeting perilously forward into the unseen—a common pastime for them. Outside the world of the cartoon, it’s less than half a year before Bill Watterson, thirty-seven at the time, will retire from producing his wildly beloved work. “Calvin and Hobbes,” which débuted in 1985, centered on six-year-old Calvin and his best friend, Hobbes, a tiger who to everyone other than Calvin appears to be a stuffed animal. Six days a week, the strip appeared in short form, in black-and-white, and each Sunday it was longer and in color. The second panel of the July 17th strip is wide, with detailed trees in the foreground, the wagon airborne, and Calvin concluding his thought: “But I’m still going to gripe about it.”</p><p>After retiring, Watterson assiduously avoided becoming a public figure. He turned his attention to painting, music, and family life. He kept the work he made to himself; he gave few, but not zero, interviews. (When asked in an e-mail interview that ran in 2013 in <em>Mental Floss</em> why he didn’t share his paintings, he replied, “It’s all catch and release—just tiny fish that aren’t really worth the trouble to clean and cook.”) Still, now and again his handiwork appeared. He wrote twice about Charles&nbsp;M. Schulz, the creator of “Peanuts,” whom he never met. For the charity of the cartoonist Richard Thompson, who had been given a diagnosis of Parkinson’s, Watterson illustrated three strips for “Pearls Before Swine,” by Stephan Pastis, and also donated a painting for auction. In other words, he came out for the team.</p><p>In 2014, he gave an extensive and chatty interview to Jenny Robb, the curator of the Billy Ireland Cartoon Library and Museum, on the occasion of his second show there. Robb asked if he was surprised that his strip was still so popular. “It seems the less I have to do with it, the higher the strip’s reputation gets!” he said. In the interview, he comes across as levelheaded, not egotistical, not very pleased with electronic devices, the Internet, the diminished size of cartoons—and also quietly intense, like the dad figure in the strip, who enthusiastically sets out on a bike ride through heavy snow. As a college student at Kenyon, Watterson spent much of a school year painting his dorm-room ceiling like that of the Sistine Chapel, and then, at the end of the year, painted it back dorm-room drab.</p><p>My ten-year-old daughter makes a detailed argument (it involves bicycles, ropes, and scratch marks) that Hobbes is indisputably real; millions of us have the more decisively illusory experience of having grown up with Watterson. But we haven’t! Will we be disturbed if, now that time has passed, he has changed? When word came out that Watterson was releasing a new book this year—“The Mysteries,” a “fable for grown-ups,” written by Watterson and illustrated in collaboration with the renowned caricaturist John Kascht—there was more than passing interest. There were also very few clues about the content, save that there’s a kingdom in trouble, living in fear of mysteries. With a different artist, I might interpret this as an enticement, but it seems more likely that Watterson is merely averse to marketing—he did no publicity for his first “Calvin and Hobbes” collection, and fought for years to prevent Hobbes and Calvin from appearing in snow globes, on pajamas, on chip-bag clips, on trading cards. (“If I’d wanted to sell plush garbage, I’d have gone to work as a carny,” he once said.) Yet Calvin and Hobbes are still everywhere, and forever young. Somewhere on the outskirts of Cleveland, their creator is probably irked that his old characters are pouncing into all these reviews of this other endeavor. As Calvin put it, the universe should have a toll-free hotline for complaints.</p><p>“The Mysteries” is clothbound and black, about eight inches square, with gray endpapers. The title font looks medieval; the text font looks contemporary. Words appear on the left page of each spread: one or two sentences in black, surrounded by a field of white. The images appear on the right, taking up most of the page, framed by a thick black line. Some of the illustrations appear to be photographs of small clay sculptures alongside elements composed in graphite and maybe paint—but the materials aren’t specified. Think Chris Van Allsburg’s “Jumanji” gone darker, crossed with Fritz Lang’s “Metropolis.” The characters, unnamed, are drawn from that strange eternal medieval world of fantasy: knights, wizards, a king; peasants with faces like Leonardo grotesques, wearing kerchiefs or hoods. There are forty-three sentences in total, and one exclamation point. The magic of condensation that is characteristic of cartoons is also here, in a story with a quick, fairy-tale beginning: “Long ago, the forest was dark and deep.”</p><p>It all sounds rather sombre, but also it doesn’t take long to read it nine or ten times. (The illustrations, slower to process, do much of the storytelling work.) The story is: Unseen mysteries have kept the populace in a state of fear. In response, a king bids his knights to capture a mystery, so that perhaps its “secrets could be learned” and its “powers could be thwarted.” When mysteries are caught, the public finds them disappointing, ordinary. One illustration is of a vender at a newspaper stand, looking askance. Below him are newspapers with headlines such as “So what?,” “Yawn,” and “Boring.” But modern technologies begin to appear: cars, skyscrapers, televisions. Mastering the secrets of the mysteries brought about a lot of technological marvels, and made the people less fearful. Or you might say insufficiently fearful: the woods are cut down, the air becomes acrid, and eventually the land looks prehistoric, desiccated, hostile to life. In one read, “The Mysteries” is a nephew of Dr. Seuss’s “The Lorax.”</p><p>It’s also kin to the ancient story of Prometheus, a myth we now associate with technological advancements. Prometheus took pity on the struggling humans, and stole fire from the gods to share it with them. And how has that magnificently useful fire gone for the humans? Pretty well by some measures, pretty catastrophically by others. If only humans heeded the warnings within mysteries as well as they followed the blueprints for making Teflon pans and missiles. I don’t think I’ll spoil the plot of “The Mysteries” if I say that the story finds a distinctive and unsettling path to its final three words, which are “happily ever after.”</p><p>“It’s a funny world, Hobbes,” Calvin says, plummeting again down a hill in a wagon with his friend. “But it’s not a hilarious world,” he says, as they fall out of their wagon. “Unless you like sick humor,” Hobbes says after he and Calvin have both crashed to the ground.</p><p>Watterson has said, of the illustrations in “Calvin and Hobbes,” “One of the jokes I really like is that the fantasies are drawn more realistically than reality, since that says a lot about what’s going on in Calvin’s head.” Only one reality in “Calvin and Hobbes” is drawn with a level of detail comparable to the scenes of Calvin’s imagination: the natural world. The woods, the streams, the snowy hills the friends career off—the natural world is a space as enchanted and real as Hobbes himself.</p><p>Enchantment! If disenchantment is the loss of myth and illusion in our lives, then what is the chant that calls those essentials back? An ongoing enchantment is at the heart of “Calvin and Hobbes.” It’s at the heart of “Don Quixote” and “Peter Pan,” too. These are stories about difficult and not infrequently destructive characters who are lost in their own worlds. At the same time, these characters embody most of what is good: the gifts of play, of the inner life, of imagining something other than what is there. If “The Mysteries” is a fable, then its moral might be that, when we believe we’ve understood the mysteries, we are misunderstanding; when we think we’ve solved them and have moved on, that error can be our dissolution.</p><p>Calvin offers the means of enchantment for seeing reality properly. This is well illustrated in the June 3, 1995, daily. (The brief black-and-white weekday strips of “Calvin and Hobbes” often feel as whole as the epic Sunday ones.) Calvin is digging a deep hole and Hobbes asks why. Calvin answers that he’s looking for buried treasure. Has he found any? Calvin replies, “A few dirty rocks, a weird root, and some disgusting grubs.” In the final panel, Hobbes: “On your first try??” Calvin: “There’s treasure everywhere!”</p><p>While rereading “Calvin and Hobbes” comics for this piece, I was surprised that almost all of them were not entirely forgotten. If I saw them on a crowded subway platform, I would recognize them, even after years of separation. Some of the silliest and most untethered of the strips have stayed with me the most: one in which Hobbes repeats the word “smock” again and again, just happy to say it; another in which Calvin writes down, “How many boards would the Mongol hoard, if the Mongol hordes got bored?”—then crumples up the paper.</p><p>Watterson has written, “Whenever the strip got ponderous, I put Calvin and Hobbes in their wagon and send them over a cliff. It had a nice way of undercutting the serious subjects.” “The Mysteries” doesn’t entirely lack that lightness—the contrast of modern and medieval in the illustrations is often funny—but humor is not its main tool. Reading “The Mysteries” after rereading “Calvin and Hobbes” reminded me of the Brothers Grimm story “The Goblins.” Goblins steal a mother’s child and replace it with a ravenous changeling. When the woman asks a neighbor for advice on how to get her child back, she is told to make the changeling laugh, because “when a changeling laughs, that’s the end of him.” She makes him laugh (by boiling water in eggshells? A trick perhaps lost across the centuries), and the goblins take the changeling away and return her child. She counters tragedy with a deliberate silliness—and it succeeds, even as the dark persists. In that sense, the old strip and the new fable work best, maybe, together. I’m also reminded of the strip in which Hobbes says, “I suppose if we couldn’t laugh at things that don’t make sense, we couldn’t react to a lot of life.”</p><p>One of the cozy pleasures of “Calvin and Hobbes” is the prominence of the seasons. This was felt even more acutely when the comics appeared daily in the paper, as they did throughout my childhood, when my brother used to call the Sunday comics insert “the intellectual pages.” (Now we both read the nearly comic-free online news instead of the material papers, into which, Watterson has said, “little jokes” were placed as a respite from “atrocities described in the rest of the newspaper.”) In the fall, a leaf pile transforms into a Calvin-eating monster; in winter, Calvin sculpts a snowman swimming away from snow-shark fins; spring is rainy, and in summer the days are just packed. Time hurries along through the year, but the years never pass—a great comfort. In “The Mysteries,” time’s arrow can’t be missed for a moment. Though the story starts in the misty forever-medieval, it quickly javelins forward. By its close, aeons have passed, and the perspective is no longer even earthbound. The book reads like someone saying goodbye. The outcome feels inevitable.</p><p>Calvin isn’t the only comic-strip character who doesn’t age. The characters in “Peanuts” never grow up, either. Schulz drew the strip for fifty years, and the final strip was published the day after he died. George Herriman drew “Krazy Kat” for more than thirty years, through to the year of his death, 1944. The characters in “Krazy Kat” also didn’t age or really change much: Krazy Kat is a black cat forever in love with Ignatz, a white mouse who serially hits Krazy with bricks, an action that Krazy misinterprets as a sign of love. Watterson has expressed admiration for both Schulz and Herriman. Yet Watterson, after ten years, moved on to other interests.</p><p>“Schulz and Peanuts: A Biography,” by David Michaelis, makes vivid that no amount of success ever separated Schulz from his sense of himself, carried over from childhood, as a lonely and overlooked “nothing.” In 2007, Watterson reviewed the biography for the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and reminded readers that “Peanuts” had as much darkness—fear, sadness, bullying—as it had charm. “Schulz illustrates the conflict in his life, not in a self-justifying or vengeful manner but with a larger human understanding that implicates himself in the sad comedy,” Watterson wrote. “I think that’s a wonderfully sane way to process a hurtful world.” Herriman, born in the nineteenth century in New Orleans to a mixed-race family, often presented himself, in his adult life, as Greek. It would be oversimplifying to say that Herriman’s background fuelled “Krazy Kat,” just as it would be oversimplifying to say that Schulz was forever a Charlie Brown—but it would be delusional to think that the persistent situations and sentiments of those comics weren’t inflected by their makers’ lives. As Krazy Kat put it, in that magic mixed-up Kat language, “An’ who but me can moddil for me, but I!”</p><p>Watterson must have been working out something in his strip, too. By his own account, he had a pretty nice childhood, with supportive parents and a house that bordered a mysterious wood. It’s possible that Watterson quit because he tired of the demanding work, or because he’d said all he had to say, or because he was worn out by the legal battles over his characters. But maybe he just changed. Growing up is always a loss—a loss of an enchanted way of seeing, at the very least—and for some people growing up is more of a loss than for others. Perhaps part of what drove Watterson, “Ahab-like” by his own telling, back to the drawing board with his boy and his tiger day after day was a subconscious commitment to staying a child. Maybe he chose to stop publishing because, in some way, for whatever reasons, he became O.K. with growing up.</p><p>In a Sunday strip on April 22, 1990, Calvin’s dad tells Calvin and Hobbes a bedtime story, by request, that is about Calvin and Hobbes. All he does, pretty much, is describe, to his rapt audience, the first part of their actual day. Calvin complains that his dad ends the story too early, that he hasn’t even gotten to lunchtime. His dad says the story has no end, because Calvin and Hobbes will go on writing it “tomorrow and every day after.” The friends are pleased to learn they’re in a story that doesn’t end.</p><p>Here’s another story, kindred to “The Mysteries,” about a knight who journeys into a dark and unknown wood. The first scene of “Sir Gawain and the Green Knight,” which is thought to have been written in the late fourteenth century, takes place in Camelot during New Year’s festivities. A good time, with feasting and friends, is interrupted by the arrival of a stranger: a massive knight, whose skin and hair are all green, who is dressed all in green, who is riding an all-green horse. The knight carries a huge axe and makes a strange proposal, in such a way that the honor of the whole court feels at stake. He invites someone to swing at his neck with his axe; in return, he will have a chance, a year and a day later, to swing the same axe at the neck of the volunteer, who ends up being Sir Gawain. The resonance of the story with facing the perils of a dark and unknown wood, of nature itself, is pretty clear.</p><p>Gawain chops off the head of the Green Knight, who then picks up his head; says, See you in a year; and rides away. Pretty quickly, the feasting and the merry mood return. How, I remember thinking the first time I read the tale, could this possibly end? It’s not satisfying if the Green Knight is killed, or if Gawain is. Maybe both of them die, I supposed.</p><p>But no. Gawain keeps his word, despite the perilous terms. En route to his meeting with the Green Knight, in the Green Chapel, he tries to behave well with the seductive wife of the lord who graciously hosts him. Then he bravely bares his neck for the terrifying Green Knight—but he learns it was an enchantment! To me, the ending follows from both good behavior and enchantment—good behavior being something Calvin despises, and enchantment being the realm in which he is king.&nbsp;♦</p></div></div>]]></description>

<!-- cache hit 1130:single/related:690e5e62d1484f6bd44b961aaf8929be --><!-- empty -->
<p>Drug store giant CVS revealed late last week that it is voluntarily pulling some common cold and flu medicines from its shelves because they don't work—while many other ineffective products remain on the shelves.</p>
<p>The move by CVS comes after an advisory panel for the Food and Drug Administration last month <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2023/09/the-spectacular-downfall-of-a-common-useless-cold-medicine/">voted unanimously that the common decongestant, phenylephrine, is ineffective at treating a stuffy nose</a>. But it comes ahead of the FDA itself acting on the vote, which will likely lead the agency to revoke phenylephrine's approval, eventually.
</p><p>In a statement to Ars, a CVS spokesperson suggested the FDA advisory panel's vote was the impetus for the change, but that it would "follow direction from the FDA."</p>
<p>"We are removing a small number of oral decongestant products that contain phenylephrine as the only active ingredient from CVS Pharmacy stores but will continue offering many other oral cough and cold products to meet consumer needs," CVS's statement read. It didn't provide additional details on which or how many products would be removed, or when the removals would be complete.</p>
<p>The culling of phenylephrine products from drug-store shelves is a long-sought win for both researchers and consumers. Since at least 2007, researchers have expressed doubt about the effectiveness of phenylephrine, which is in popular oral medicines with brand names including Sudafed, Mucinex, Nyquil, and Benadryl. The small studies from the 1960s and 1970s that formed the basis of the FDA's initial approval in 1976 were found to be seriously flawed. And three large clinical trials since 2007 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2015/10/common-decongestant-may-be-worthless-study-finds/">showed the drug doesn't work</a>. Pharmacological studies showed why: Phenylephrine is highly metabolized in the gut, with less than 1 percent of active drug remaining bioavailable. Consumers, meanwhile, were largely in the dark, spending nearly $2 billion in 2022 on these products that researchers have said for years don't work.
</p><p>But as these useless drugs finally vanish from CVS shelves, left behind is an entire class of products that are equally useless: homeopathic products.</p>                                            
                                                        
<h2>“Snake oil” remains</h2>
<p>These bogus treatments are based on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2007/09/the-pseudoscience-behind-homeopathy/">centuries-old pseudoscience and have repeatedly been proven to be no more effective than placebo</a>. In fact, if they were to prove effective, it would upend fundamental scientific understandings. For decades, consumer advocates and watchdogs <a href="https://www.citizen.org/article/outrage-of-the-month-fda-guidance-on-homeopathic-drugs-an-ongoing-public-health-failure/">have railed against them</a>, yet these products are readily available on the shelves of every major drug store.</p>
<p>Homeopathy relies on two false ideas: the "law of similars" aka "like cures like," meaning a substance that causes a specific symptom in a healthy person can treat conditions and diseases in an ill person with that same symptom; and the "law of infinitesimals," which states that diluting a supposedly curative substance renders it more potent at treating medical conditions. As such, homeopathic products often start with bizarre, sometimes toxic substances that end up being diluted into oblivion in ritualistic procedures. The result is simply water or inactive filler ingredients. Homeopaths have acknowledged this and sometimes counter that water molecules have a "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_memory#:~:text=%5BBenveniste's%5D%20latest%20theory%2C%20and,to%20a%20container%20of%20ordinary">memory</a>" of substances (they don't).</p>
<figure><img alt="A homeopathic product lurking on a CVS shelf alongside real medicines." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/pasted-image-0-copy.jpeg" width="624" height="351"><figcaption><p>A homeopathic product lurking on a CVS shelf alongside real medicines.</p><p>CFI</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Sound absurd? It is. And yet, homeopathic products are not only available in major drug stores and retailers around the country, they're often sold on the same shelves, side by side with evidence-based medicines that have gone through rigorous FDA safety and efficacy evaluations.</p>
<p>The FDA does have the authority to regulate homeopathic products. But, based on the 1938 Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, homeopathic products are generally <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1513393">considered exempt from pre-market FDA safety and efficacy reviews</a> as long as the active ingredient is included in the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia, a published list of substances approved by homeopaths. As such, homeopathic products enter the market without any FDA review—and sit on shelves with FDA-approved, evidence-based medicines.</p>
<p>"Most people don't know what this stuff is," Nicholas Little, vice president and legal director for the consumer advocacy organization the Center for Inquiry (CFI), said of homeopathic products in an interview with Ars.</p>

<p>Hundreds of driverless cars are now an everyday part of traffic in San Francisco as they shuttle passengers across town, but how safe are they and how do they compare to human drivers?  Waymo, owned by Google's parent company Alphabet, just released a new study that attempts to shed light on its own track record as one of San Francisco's largest driverless car companies.  The findings, described as first-of-its-kind research, make the case that Waymo's driverless fleet is able to steer clear of certain types of collisions at a higher rate than human drivers.</p>

<p>“It shows that we’re safe,” said Trent Victor, Waymo Director of Safety Research and Best Practices. “We're seeing the fruits of our focus on safety.”</p>

<p>Waymo, in partnership with insurance giant Swiss Re, analyzed insurance liability claims in an effort to collect collision data involving both driverless vehicles and human-driven cars.  The study utilized 600,000 claims stretching over 125 billion miles to create a "baseline" for human driver collisions that could be compared against Waymo's record involving 3.8 million miles traveled without a human in the driver's seat.</p>

<p>Attempting to draw fair comparisons between the safety record of driverless cars versus human drivers is a complex feat that has repeatedly proven difficult for the autonomous vehicle industry, according to experts.</p>


<p>“The kind of reporting that is used in insurance is much more standardized than any other kind of collision data that you have around,” said Luigi Di Lillo, Head of Products and Partnerships for Swiss Re.&nbsp;“The novelty of this study is to connect the insurance claims data to safety directly.”</p>

<p>Waymo’s driverless vehicles, which currently operate in San Francisco and Phoenix, experienced 76% fewer accidents involving property damage compared to human-driven cars, according to the study.  For every million miles traveled, human drivers filed 3.26 property damage claims compared to 0.78 for Waymo's driverless cars.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>I think this is an opportunity for people to get to know Waymo as something that’s different than our competitors.</p><cite>Trent Victor, Waymo Director of Safety Research and Best Practices</cite></blockquote></figure>

<p>“This is an amazing moment,” said Victor, who spoke to the Investigative Unit in his only television interview.  “I think this is an opportunity for people to get to know Waymo as something that’s different than our competitors.”</p>

<p>Waymo’s main competition is GM’s Cruise, which recently cut its fleet of driverless cars in half at the direction of California’s Department of Motor Vehicles.&nbsp;The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/san-francisco/california-dmv-san-francisco-cruise-driverless-cars/3299222/" target="_blank">DMV announced its request</a> at the same time it revealed it was launching an investigation into Cruise’s safety record following a series of headline-making accidents, including a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/san-francisco/cruise-driverless-car-crash/3298626/" target="_blank">collision with a San Francisco fire truck</a>.&nbsp; According to Cruise, its vehicle had a green light when it struck the fire engine, which had its sirens on and appeared to be en route to an emergency scene.  </p>

<p>Following the state's request to reduce Cruise's fleet, a company spokesperson provided NBC Bay Area with a statement, noting "Cruise positively impacts overall road safety," adding that Cruise looks forward to "working with the DMV to make any improvements and provide any data they need to reinforce the safety and efficiency of our fleet."</p>

<p>While the DMV continues its investigation, Cruise’s driverless fleet will be capped at 50 cars during the day and 150 cars at night. In August, Waymo told state regulators it possessed a total fleet of 250 driverless cars in San Francisco, of which about 100 are on the road at any given time.&nbsp;Those figures remain largely unchanged, according to a Waymo spokesperson.</p>

<p>Just last month, state regulators with the California Public Utilities Commission <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/cpuc-vote-driverless-car-operations-expansion-san-francisco/3293096/" target="_blank">granted approval</a> to both Waymo and Cruise to expand their ride-hailing services across San Francisco 24/7, with no limits on how many driverless cars they can put on the road.</p>

<p>Waymo’s new study also notes the company’s driverless vehicles have not been involved in a single crash resulting in “bodily injury,” however, some critics have questioned whether the cars have been on the road long enough to begin making fair comparisons to human drivers.&nbsp;For example, Waymo’s driverless cars have traveled roughly 4 million miles, but traffic-related fatalities are routinely measured per 100 million miles.  Across America's roadways last year, there were 1.37 fatalities for every 100 million miles traveled, totaling 42,795 lives lost in vehicle traffic crashes, according to the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/traffic-crash-death-estimates-2022" target="_blank">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a>.  Each year, human drivers log more than 3 trillion miles on the road.</p>

<p>“It’s interesting that we were able to show statistical significance with so little data,” Victor said.&nbsp;“That has to do with two things: one is that we have very robust baselines from Swiss Re, and the other is that we have incredible safety performance.”</p>

<p>Waymo did not release the raw data it used to come up with its findings, saying that information is “proprietary.” </p>

<p>"The information they released is the results of the study rather than all the details," said Steven Shladover, a research engineer with the Berkeley's Institute of Transportation Studies.  "Of course, as researchers, we like to look more at the details and the methods for the analysis."</p>

<p>Shladover said he was also "disappointed" the study grouped its findings for both San Francisco and Phoenix instead of sharing separate data points for each city.  While Waymo's study only offered combined figures, it examined different time spans for each city: Waymo's Phoenix data spanned more than four years (March 2019 to Aug. 1, 2023), while Waymo's San Francisco data incorporated less than two years' worth of driving (March 2022 to Aug. 1, 2023), according to a Waymo spokesperson.</p>

<p>"It lumped them all together and those are quite different areas," he said.  "I think it would have been more interesting to see a comparison for San Francisco and then a separate comparison for Phoenix."</p>

<p>Leaders at Waymo and Swiss Re said they plan to eventually submit their study to a scientific journal so that it can be independently reviewed, however, neither company would say when that might happen.</p>

<p>“We are targeting the right journal,” said Di Lillo.&nbsp;“I’m very picky on that.”</p>

<p>
								Hundreds of driverless cars are now an everyday part of traffic in San Francisco, but how safe are they and how do they compare to human drivers?&nbsp;Google’s Waymo, one of the largest driverless car companies in the city, just released a new study that attempts to shed light on its own track record.
