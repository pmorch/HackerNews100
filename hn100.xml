            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://henryhmko.github.io/posts/tpu/tpu.html">https://henryhmko.github.io/posts/tpu/tpu.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44342977">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>I've been working with TPUs a lot recently and it's fun to see how they had such different design philosophies compared to GPUs.</p>

        <p>The main strongpoint for TPUs is in their scalability. This is achieved through a co-design of both the hardware side (e.g. energy efficiency and modularity) and the software side (e.g. XLA compiler).</p>

        <br>
        <h2><span>Background</span></h2>
        <p>To give a brief tldr on TPUs, it's <mark>Google's ASIC that focuses on two factors: extreme matmul throughput + energy efficiency.</mark></p>

        <p>Their origins go back to Google in 2006, when they were first evaluating whether they should implement either GPUs, FPGAs, or custom ASICs. Back then there were only a few applications that necessitated specialized hardware and they decided those needs could be met by bringing in excess CPU compute from their large datacenters. But this changed in 2013 when Google's voice search feature ran on neural networks and internal projections speculated that they would need much more compute if it took off.</p>

        <p>Fast forward to today and TPUs power the majority of Google's AI services. Of course, that includes training and inference of Gemini or Veo, but also deploying their recommendation models (DLRMs).</p>

        <p>Let's dive in and look at TPU internals from the bottom up.</p>

        <br>
        <h2>TPU Single-Chip Level</h2>
        <p>I'll focus my diagrams to TPUv4, but this layout is more or less applicable to latest generation TPUs (e.g. TPUv6p "Trillium"; TPUv7 "Ironwood's details aren't released as of writing in June, 2025).</p>

        <p>Here's the layout of a single TPUv4 chip:</p>

        <!-- <figure style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="images/single_chip.png" alt="chip diagram" width="auto" height="500" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right: auto;">
            <figcaption style="margin-top: 10px; font-style: italic;">TPU Single Chip + TensorCore</figcaption>
        </figure> -->
        <figure>
          <img src="https://henryhmko.github.io/posts/tpu/images/single_chip.png" alt="chip diagram">
          <figcaption>TPU Single Chip + TensorCore</figcaption>
      </figure>
        


        <p>In each chip, there's two TPU TensorCores, which are responsible for our compute. (Note: inference-specialized TPUs have only one TensorCore). Both TensorCores have shared memory units: CMEM(128MiB) and HBM(32GiB).</p>

        <p>And within each TensorCore, there lies our compute units and smaller memory buffers:</p>

        <ol>
                <h3>1. Matrix Multiply Unit (MXU)</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- This is the key component of the TensorCore and is a 128x128 systolic array.</li>
                  <li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- We'll cover systolic arrays below.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Vector Unit (VPU)</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- General elementwise operations (e.g. ReLU, pointwise add/mul, reductions)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. Vector Memory (VMEM; 32MiB)</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Memory buffer. Data from HBM is copied into the VMEM before the TensorCore can do any computations.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>4. Scalar Unit + Scalar Memory (SMEM; 10MiB)</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Tell the VPU and MXU what to do.</li>
                  <li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Manages control flow, scalar operations, and memory address generation.</li>
                </ul>
        </ol>

        
        <p>If you're coming from NVIDIA GPUs, there's some initial observations that might throw you off:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>On-chip memory units (CMEM, VMEM, SMEM) on TPUs are much larger than L1, L2 caches on GPUs.</li>
            <li>HBM on TPUs are also much smaller than HBM on GPUs.</li>
            <li>There seems to be a lot less "cores" responsible for the computation.</li>
        </ol>
        

        <p>This is the complete opposite of GPUs where they have smaller L1, L2 caches (256KB and 50MB, respectively for H100), larger HBM (80GB for H100), and tens of thousands of cores.</p>

        <p>Before we go any further, recall that TPUs are capable of extremely high throughput just like GPUs. TPU v5p can achieve 500 TFLOPs/sec per chip and with a full pod of 8960 chips we can achieve approximately 4.45 ExaFLOPs/sec. The newest "Ironwood" TPUv7 is said to reach up to 42.5 ExaFLOPS/sec per pod (9216 chips).</p>

        <p>To understand how TPUs achieve this, we need to understand their design philosophy.</p>

        <br>
        <h2>TPU Design Philosophy</h2>

        <p>TPUs achieve amazing throughput and energy efficiency by relying on two large pillars and a key assumption: systolic arrays + pipelining, Ahead-of-Time (AoT) compilation, and the assumption that most operations can be expressed in a way that maps well to systolic arrays. Fortunately, in our modern DL era, matmuls comprise the bulk of computation, which are fit for systolic arrays.</p>

        <br>
        <h2>TPU Design choice #1: Systolic Arrays + Pipelining</h2>

        <h3><span>Q. What is a Systolic Array?</span></h3>

        <p>Systolic array is a hardware design architecture consisting of a grid of interconnected processing elements (PE). Each PE performs a small computation (e.g. multiply and accumulate) and passes the results to neighboring PEs.</p>

        <br>
        <!-- <figure style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="images/systolic_arr.png" alt="systolic array diagram" width="auto" height="500" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right: auto;">
        </figure> -->
        <figure>
          <img src="https://henryhmko.github.io/posts/tpu/images/systolic_arr.png" alt="systolic array diagram">
      </figure>
        

        <p>The benefit of such a design is that once data is passed into a systolic array, additional control logic on how data should be processed is not required. Also, when given a large enough systolic array, there's no memory read/writes other than the input and output.</p>

        <p>Due to their rigid organization, systolic arrays can only handle operations with fixed dataflow patterns, but fortunately matrix multiplication and convolutions fit perfectly in this regime.</p>

        <p>Moreover, there's clear opportunities for pipelining to overlap computation with data movements. Here's a diagram below for a pipelined pointwise operation on a TPU.</p>

        <br>
        <!-- <figure style="text-align: center;">

      </figure>
        <h3><span>Aside: Downsides of Systolic Arrays - Sparsity</span></h3>

        <p>You can see how systolic arrays love dense matrices (i.e. When every PE is active nearly every cycle). However, the downside is that there's no performance improvements for sparse matrices of the same size: the same number of cycles will have to be performed where PEs are still doing work even for zero-valued elements.</p>

        <p><mark>Dealing with this systematic limitation of systolic arrays will become more important if the DL community favors more irregular sparsity (e.g. MoE).</mark></p>

        <h2>TPU Design choice #2: Ahead of Time (AoT) Compilation + Less Reliance on Caches</h2>

        <p>This section answers how TPUs achieve high energy efficiencies through avoiding caches through <mark>hardware-software codesign of TPUs + XLA compiler.</mark></p>

        <p>First, recall that traditional caches are designed to handle unpredictable memory access patterns. A program for one application can have vastly different memory access patterns with those from programs for other applications. In essence, caches allow hardware to be flexible and adapt to a wide range of applications. This is a large reason why GPUs are very flexible hardware (note: compared to TPUs).</p>

        <p>However, cache accesses (and memory accesses in general) cost significant energy. Below is a rough estimate of energy costs for operations on a chip (45nm, 0.9V; <a href="#ref18">[18]</a>). The key takeaway here is that memory access and control takes up most of our energy and that arithmetic takes up significantly less.</p>

        <br>
        <!-- <figure style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="images/patterson_breakdown.png" alt="TPU data movement visualized" width="auto" height="150" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right: auto;">
        </figure> -->
        <figure>
          <img src="https://henryhmko.github.io/posts/tpu/images/patterson_breakdown.png" alt="TPU data movement visualized">
      </figure>
        

        <p>But what if your application is very specific and its computation/memory access patterns are highly predictable?</p>

        <p>As an extreme example, if our compiler can figure out all the required memory accesses ahead of time, then our hardware can get by with just a scratchpad memory as a buffer with no caches.</p>

        <p>This is what the TPU philosophy aims for and exactly why TPUs were codesigned with the XLA compiler to achieve this. The XLA compiler generates optimized programs by analyzing computation graphs ahead of time.</p>

        <br>
        <h3><span>Q. But JAX also works well with TPUs, but they use <code>@jit</code>?</span></h3>

        <p>JAX+XLA on TPUs are in a hybrid space of JIT and AOT, thus the confusion. When we call a jitted function in JAX for the first time, JAX traces it to create a static computation graph. This is passed to the XLA compiler, where it is turned into a fully static binary for TPUs. It is during the last conversion stage where TPU-specific optimizations are done (e.g. minimize memory accesses) to tailor the process to TPUs.</p>

        <p>But there's one caution: jitted functions have to be compiled and cached again if they are run with different input shapes. That's why JAX does poorly with any dynamic padding or layers with for loops with different lengths that depend on the input.</p>

        <p>Of course, this approach sounds very good but there are also inconvenient downsides. There's the lack of flexibility and this heavy reliance on compilers is a double-edged sword.</p>

        <p>But why did Google still pursue this design philosophy?</p>

        <br>
        <h3><span>TPUs and Energy Efficiency (TPUv4)</span></h3>

        <p>The previous diagram for energy usage was not an accurate representation for TPUs, so here's the energy usage breakdown for TPUv4. Note that TPUv4 is 7nm and the 45nm is there for a comparison (<a href="#ref3">[3]</a>, <a href="#ref16">[16]</a>).</p>

        <br>
        <!-- <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; gap: 20px; align-items: flex-end;">
          <figure style="text-align: center; margin: 0;">

          </figure>
      </div> -->
        
        

        <p>The bar plot on the left shows us the visualization of values, but one thing to note is that modern chips use HBM3, which uses much less energy than DDR3/4 DRAM shown over here. Nevertheless, this shows how memory operations consume a couple orders of magnitudes more energy.</p>

        <p>This is a good connection with <mark>modern scaling laws: we're very much happy to increase FLOPS in exchange for reduced memory operations.</mark> So reducing memory operations has double the optimization benefits since they not only make programs fast, but also consume much less energy.</p>

        <br>
        <h2>TPU Multi-Chip Level</h2>

        <p>Let's move up the ladder to look at how TPUs work in multi-chip settings.</p>

        <br>
        <h2><span>Tray Level (a.k.a "Board"; 4 chips)</span></h2>
        
        <br>
        <!-- <figure style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="images/tray.png" alt="TPU data movement visualized" width="auto" height="300" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right: auto;">
        </figure> -->
        <figure>
          <img src="https://henryhmko.github.io/posts/tpu/images/tray.png" alt="TPU data movement visualized">
      </figure>
        

        <p>A single TPU tray consists of 4 TPU chips or 8 TensorCores (referred to as just "cores"). And each tray gets its own CPU Host (Note: For inference TPUs, one host accesses 2 trays since they only have 1 core per chip).</p>

        <p>Host⇔Chip connection is PCIe, but Chip⇔Chip connection is Inter-Core Interconnect (ICI), which has a higher bandwidth.</p>

        <p>But ICI connections extend much further to multiple trays. And for this, we need to move up to the Rack level.</p>

        <br>
        <h2><span>Rack Level (4x4x4 chips)</span></h2>

        <p>The especially exciting part about TPUs is in their scalability, which we start to see from the Rack level.</p>

        <p>A TPU rack consists of 64 TPUs that are connected in a 4x4x4 3D torus. If you saw Google's promotion material for TPUs like below, this is an image of 8 TPU racks.</p>

        <br>
        <figure>
          <img src="https://henryhmko.github.io/posts/tpu/images/tpu_racks.png" alt="TPU data movement visualized" width="auto" height="300">
          <figcaption>8 TPU Racks (TPUv4)</figcaption>
        </figure>
        

        <p>But before we dive into racks, we need to clarify some confusing terminology: racks vs pods vs slices.</p>

        <br>
        <h3><span>Q. What's the difference between a "TPU Rack" vs a "TPU Pod" vs "TPU Slice?</span></h3>

        <p>Different Google sources use them a bit differently and sometimes use "TPU Pods" and "TPU Slices" interchangeably. But for this article we'll stick with the definitions used in Google's TPU papers and in GCP's TPU documentation (<a href="#ref3">[3]</a>, <a href="#ref7">[7]</a>, <a href="#ref9">[9]</a>).</p>

        <ol>
            <li><span>TPU Rack:</span>
              <br> - Physical unit that contains 64 chips. Also known as a "cube".</li>
            <li><span>TPU Pod:</span>
              <br> - Maximum unit of TPUs that can be connected through ICI and optical fibers.
              <br> - Also known as a "Superpod" or "Full pod". For example, a TPU Pod for TPUv4 would consist of 4096 chips or 64 TPU Racks.</li>
            <li><span>TPU Slice:</span>
              <br> - Any configuration of TPUs that are in between 4 chips and the Superpod size.</li>
        </ol>


        <p><mark>The key difference is that a TPU Rack and a TPU Pod is a physical unit of measure whereas a TPU Slice is an abstract one.</mark> There's, of course, important physical properties for setting a TPU Slice but let's abstract this away for now.</p>

        <p>For now, we'll work with physical units of measure: TPU Racks and TPU Pods. This is because seeing how TPU systems are physically wired together allows us to understand TPU design philosophies better.</p>

        
        <p>Now back to TPU racks (for TPUv4):</p>

        <p>A single TPU Rack consists of 64 chips that are connected together through ICI and Optical Circuit Switching (OCS). In essence, we connect multiple trays together to emulate a system of 64 chips. This theme of putting together smaller parts to make a supercomputer continues to appear later.</p>

        <p>Below is a diagram for a single TPUv4 Rack. It's a 4x4x4 3D torus where each node is a chip, and the arrows in blue are ICI while the lines on the faces are OCS (redrawn from <a href="#ref7">[7]</a>).</p>

        <br>
        <!-- <figure style="text-align: center;">

          <figcaption>Single TPU Rack with OCS</figcaption>
      </figure>
        

        <p>This diagram, however, raises a couple questions. <em>Why is the OCS only used for the faces?</em> In other words, <em>what are the benefits of using OCS?</em> There's 3 large benefits and we'll cover the other two down below later.</p>

        <br>
        <h3><span>Benefits of OCS #1: Wraparound</span></h3>

        <p><mark>Faster communication between nodes through wraparound</mark></p>

        <p>The OCS also acts as a wraparound for a given TPU configuration. This reduces the worst case number of hops between two nodes from N-1 hops to (N-1)/2 per axis, as each axis becomes a ring (1D torus).</p>

        <p>This effect becomes more important as we scale up further since reducing chip-to-chip communication latency becomes crucial for high parallelization.</p>

        <br>
        <h3><span>Aside: Not all TPUs have 3D Torus Topologies</span></h3>

        <p>Note: older TPU generations (e.g. TPUv2, v3) and inference TPUs (e.g. TPUv5e, TPUv6e) have a 2D torus topology instead of a 3D torus like below. The TPUv7 "Ironwood", however, seems to be a 3D torus although it's promoted as an inference chip (Note: I'm only assuming from their promotional material).</p>

        <br>
        <!-- <figure style="text-align: center;">

          <figcaption>2D Torus Topology</figcaption>
      </figure>
        <h2>Full Pod Level (aka "Superpod"; 4096 chips for TPUv4)</h2>

        <p>Just like how we connected multiple chips together to make a TPU Rack, we can connect multiple racks to make one large Superpod.</p>

        <p>A Superpod also refers to the largest configuration of interconnected chips (using only ICI and OCS) that TPUs can reach. There is a multi-pod level next, but this has to go through a slower interconnect and we'll cover this after this.</p>

        <p>This changes depending on the generation, but for TPUv4 is 4096 chips (i.e. 64 Racks of 4x4x4 chips). For the newest TPUv7 "Ironwood", this is 9216 chips.</p>

        <p>The diagram below shows one Superpod for TPUv4.</p>

        <br>
        <figure>
          <img src="https://henryhmko.github.io/posts/tpu/images/full_pod.png" alt="TPU data movement visualized">
          <figcaption>Superpod for TPUv4 (64 Racks)</figcaption>
      </figure>
        

        <p>Note how each cube (i.e. a TPU Rack) is connected with each other through OCS. This also allows us to take slices of TPUs in a pod.</p>

        <br>
        <h3><span>TPU Slices with OCS</span></h3>

        <p>We can request subsets of TPUs within the pod and these are TPU Slices. But there's multiple topologies to choose from even if you want N chips.</p>

        <p>For example, say you want a total of 512 chips. You can ask for a cube (8x8x8), a cigar shape (4x4x32), or a rectangle (4x8x16). Choosing the topology of the slice is a hyperparameter in itself.</p>

        <p><mark>The topology you choose will affect the communication bandwidth between nodes. And this directly affects the performance of different parallelism methods.</mark></p>

        <p>For example, a cube (ex. 8x8x8) would be preferred for all-to-all communications, such as data parallelism or tensor parallelism, because it has the highest bisection bandwidth. However, a cigar shape (ex. 4x4x32) would be better for pipeline parallelism as it can communicate with sequential layers faster (assuming one layer fits in a sub-slice of 4x4 chips).</p>

        <br>
        <!-- <figure style="text-align: center;">

      </figure>
        

        <p>But, of course, optimal topologies would depend on the model and finding this is a job in itself as well. The TPUv4 paper<a href="#ref9">[9]</a> also measured this to show how topology changes can accelerate throughput (Note: I'm not sure which LLM architecture the first row is referring to as it wasn't specified).</p>

      </figure>
        

        <p>We covered TPU Slices, but there's one important feature that contributes to a high operational stability of TPUs.</p>

        <p>It's that these slices do not have to be contiguous racks thanks to OCS. This is the second benefit of using OCS–and probably the largest–that we didn't get to earlier.</p>

        <br>
        <h3><span>Benefits of OCS #2: (Reconfigurable) Noncontiguous Multi-Node Slices</span></h3>

        <p>Note that this is different from hard-wiring multiple nodes together to emulate noncontiguous slices. Since OCS is a switch instead of being hard-wired, there's much less physical wires across nodes, thus allowing for higher scalability (i.e. larger TPU Pod sizes).</p>

        <p><mark>This allows flexible node configuration as scale.</mark> For example, say there are three jobs we want to run on a single pod. Although naive scheduling would not allow this, OCS connections instead allow us to abstract away the position of nodes and view the entire pod as just a <mark>"bag of nodes"</mark> (redrawn from <a href="#ref6">[6]</a>).</p>

        <br>
        <!-- <figure style="text-align: center;">

          <figcaption>Individual Jobs Can Treat TPU Racks in a Pod as "Bag of Nodes"</figcaption>
      </figure>
        

        <p>This increases pod utilization and possibly much easier maintenance in case of failed nodes. Google described this as <em>"Dead nodes have small blast radius."</em> However, I'm not sure how its liquid cooling would be impacted when only certain nodes have to be shut down.</p>

        <p>Finally, there's an interesting extension of this flexible OCS: we can also change the topology of TPU Slices, such as from a regular torus to a twisted torus.</p>

        <br>
        <h3><span>Benefits of OCS #3: Twisted TPU Topologies</span></h3>

        <p>We previously saw how we could achieve different TPU Slice topologies by changing (x,y,z) dimensions for a fixed number of chips. This time, however, we'll be working with fixed (x,y,z) dimensions, but instead change how they are wired together to achieve different topologies.</p>

        <p>A notable example is going from a regular torus of a cigar shape into a twisted cigar torus as seen below.</p>

        <br>
        <!-- <figure style="text-align: center;">

      </figure>
        

        <p>The twisted torus case allows for faster communication between chips across the twisted 2D plane. This is especially useful for accelerating all-to-all communications.</p>

        <p>Let's dive a little deeper and imagine a concrete scenario where this would help.</p>

        <br>
        <h3><span>Accelerated Training using Twisted Torus</span></h3>

        <p>Theoretically, twisting the torus will bring the largest benefit for tensor parallel (TP) since there are multiple all-gather and reduce-scatter operations per layer. It could bring moderate benefits for data parallel (DP) since there's an all-reduce per training step as well, but this would be less frequent.</p>

        <p>Imagine we're training a standard decoder-only transformer and we want to employ lots of parallelism to accelerate training. We'll see two scenarios below.</p>

        <br>
        <h4><span><mark>Scenario #1: 4x4x16 Topology (TP + PP; Total 256 chips)</mark></span></h4>
        <!-- <p><strong>Scenario #1: 4x4x16 Topology (TP + PP; Total 256 chips)</strong></p> -->

        <p>Our z axis will be our pipeline parallel(PP) dimension and our 2D TP dimension will be 4x4. In essence, assume each layer k lies at z=k and that each layer is sharded across 16 chips. Assume standard OCS connections (i.e. nearest-neighbor) if not explicitly drawn.</p>

        <p>We'll twist the 2D torus at each z=k, which makes communication between chips in each TP layer faster. Twisting along our PP dimension is unnecessary as they rely mostly on point-to-point communication.</p>

        <p><strong>Note:</strong> In reality, twisting the torus brings benefits when the number of chips is larger than 4x4. We're using 4x4 only for visualization purposes.</p>

        <!-- <p><strong>Scenario #2: 16x4x16 Topology (DP + TP + PP; Total 1024 chips)</strong></p> -->

        <p>As an extension, we'll be adding a DP dimension of 4 to our previous scenario. This means there's 4 of scenario #1 models along the x axis.</p>

      </figure>
        

        <p>Notice how twisting the torus is limited to each TP dimension of each DP model (i.e. A 4x4 2D plane for each z=k given k=1…16). There is only a wraparound for the DP dimension so that each row becomes a horizontal ring of size 16.</p>

        <p>You might have noticed that there's an alternative topology of 8x8x16 instead (i.e. 2x2 DP dimension), but this becomes more complicated as we're mixing our DP and TP dimensions. Specifically, it's unclear how we should construct the OCS wraparounds for the y-axis while accommodating twisted toruses for each TP dimension.</p>

        <h2>Multi-Pod Level (a.k.a "Multislice"; 4096+ chips for TPUv4)</h2>

        <p>The final level of TPU hierarchy is the Multi-pod level. This is where you can treat multiple pods as one large machine. However, the communication between pods is done through Data-Center Network (DCN), which has a lower bandwidth than ICI.</p>

        <p>Making this possible is difficult on its own, but what makes this more impressive is the focus on developer experience. Specifically, it's about focusing on the question of "How can we abstract the systems/HW part of model scaling as much as possible?".</p>

        <p>Google's answer is to make the XLA compiler responsible for coordinating communication between chips at large scales. With the right flags given by researchers (i.e. Parallelism dimensions for DP, FSDP, TP, num slices, etc), the XLA compiler inserts the right hierarchical collectives for the TPU topology at hand (Xu et al, 2021: GSPMD <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>). The goal is to make large scale training happen with as little code changes as possible.</p>

        <p>For example, here's a breakdown of an all-reduce operation across multiple slices from Google's blog <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>.</p>

        <br>
        <!-- <figure style="text-align: center;">

          <figcaption>XLA Reduction of All-Reduce Across Pods</figcaption>
      </figure>
        

        <p>This is to show that the XLA compiler takes care of communication collectives both between slices and within slices.</p>

        <p>For a concrete example, there could be a TPU topology like below for training a model. The activation communication happens within a slice through ICI whereas gradient communications will happen across slices through DCN (i.e. across the DCN DP dim) <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>.</p>

        <h2>Putting diagrams to perspective in real-life</h2>

        <p>I find it helpful to put diagrams into perspective when you have actual photos of hardware. Here's a summary below.</p>

        <p>If you’ve seen pictures of Google’s promotion material for TPUs, you might have come across this image below.</p>

          <figcaption>8 TPU Racks (TPUv4)</figcaption>
        </figure>
        

        <p>This is 8xTPU Pods where each unit is a 4x4x4 3D torus we saw above. Each row in a pod has 2 trays, meaning there's 8 TPU chips per row.</p>

        <p>Here’s a single TPUv4 tray:</p>

        <br>
        <!-- <figure style="text-align: center;">

        <p>Note that the diagram is simplified to just one PCIe port, but on the actual tray there’s 4 PCIe ports(on the left)--one for each TPU.</p>

        <p>And here’s a single chip below:</p>

        <p>The center piece is the ASIC and the surrounding 4 blocks are the HBM stacks. This is a TPU v4 we’re seeing, so it has 2 TensorCores inside, hence the total of 4 HBM stacks.</p>

        <p>I couldn’t find the chip floorplan for TPUv4, so here’s one for TPUv4i which is similar except that it only has 1 TensorCore since it’s an inference chip <a href="#ref3">[3]</a>.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/lfnoise/sapf">https://github.com/lfnoise/sapf</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44342731">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><pre>WHAT

This program is called:

"A tool for exploring sound as pure form." or "sound as pure form" or "sapf"

It is an interpreter for a language for creating and transforming sound. The
language is mostly functional, stack based and uses postfix notation similar to
FORTH. It represents audio and control events using lazy, possibly infinite
sequences. It intends to do for lazy sequences what APL does for arrays: provide
very high level functions with pervasive automatic mapping, scanning, and
reduction operators. This makes for a language where short programs can achieve
results out of proportion to their size. Because nearly all of the programmer
accessible data types are immutable, the language can easily run multiple
threads without deadlock or corruption.

WHY

Other languages that inspired this one:
    APL, Joy[1], Haskell, Piccola[2], Nyquist[3], SuperCollider[4].

APL and FORTH (from which Joy derives) are both widely derided for being
write-only languages. Nevertheless, there has yet to be a language of such
concise expressive power as APL or its descendants. APL is powerful not because
of its bizarre symbols or syntax, but due to the way it automatically maps
operations over arrays and allows iterations at depth within arrays. This means
one almost never needs to write a loop or think about operations one-at-a-time.
Instead one can think about operations on whole structures.

Here is a great quote from Alan Perlis[5] on APL, which that also reflects my
interest in this way of programming :

"What attracted me, then, to APL was a feeling that perhaps through APL one
might begin to acquire some of the dimensions in programming that we revere in
natural language — some of the pleasures of composition; of saying things
elegantly; of being brief, poetic, artistic, that makes our natural languages
so precious to us."

The Joy language introduced concatenative functional programming. This generally
means a stack based virtual machine, and a program consisting of words which are
functions taking an input stack and returning an output stack. The natural
syntax that results is postfix. Over a very long time I have come to feel that
syntax gets in between me and the power in a language. Postfix is the least
syntax possible.

There are several reasons I like the concatenative style of programming:
    Function composition is concatenation. 
    Pipelining values through functions to get new values is the most natural
        idiom.
    Functions are applied from left to right instead of inside out. 
    Support for multiple return values comes for free. 
    No need for operator precedence. 
    Fewer delimiters are required: 
        Parentheses are not needed to control operator precedence.
        Semicolons are not needed to separate statements.
        Commas are not needed to separate arguments.

(Note: Sapf is inspired by, but is not purely a concatenative language because it has lexical variables.)

When I am programming interactively, I most often find myself in the situation
where I have a value and I want to transform it to something else. The thing to
do is apply a function with some parameters. With concatenative programming this
is very natural. You string along several words and get a new value.


QUICK SET-UP

Put the sapf program into ~/bin or wherever you keep commands.
Since this binary is unsigned you will need to remove Apple's quarantine attribute:

xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine &lt;path-to-sapf-binary&gt;

Set up the environment variables in Terminal or your shell profile. 
For example:

export SAPF_HISTORY="$HOME/sapf-files/sapf-history.txt"
export SAPF_LOG="$HOME/sapf-files/sapf-log.txt"
export SAPF_PRELUDE="$HOME/sapf-files/sapf-prelude.txt"
export SAPF_EXAMPLES="$HOME/sapf-files/sapf-examples.txt"
export SAPF_README="$HOME/sapf-files/README.txt"
export SAPF_RECORDINGS="$HOME/sapf-files/recordings"
export SAPF_SPECTROGRAMS="$HOME/sapf-files/spectrograms"

read this README. 

check out some examples:
    start sapf in Terminal.
    open sapf-examples.txt in a text editor
    copy an example onto the command line.

TYPES
    "It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure 
    than 10 functions on 10 data structures." -- Alan Perlis

    The language has a bare minimum of data types:
        Real - a 64 bit double precision floating point number for quantifying
            things.
        String - a string of characters for naming things.
        List - Ordered lists of values that function as both arrays and lazy
            potentially infinitely long sequences.
        Form - An object that maps symbolic names to values. A form is a
            dictionary with inheritance.
        Function - Functions are values that when applied take values from the
            stack and evaluate an expression.
        Ref - A mutable container for a value. This is the only mutable data
            type.
        
        
SYNTAX
    Expressions are sequences of words (or other syntactic elements) written in postfix 
    form. All words are are executed in left to right order as they are encountered. 
    When a word is executed it looks up the value bound to that word. If the value is a 
    function, then the function is applied and any arguments of the function are taken 
    from the stack. If the value is not a function then the value itself is pushed onto 
    the stack. 

    
    2 3 *  --&gt;  6
    
    "--&gt;" means "evaluates to" throughout this document.

STRINGS
    Strings are enclosed in double quotes. 
    
    "This is a string"
    
    \\n is newline and \\t is tab.
    
    "\\tThis string begins with a tab and ends with a newline.\\n"

WORDS
    Words are sequences of characters delimited by spaces, square brackets,
    curly brackets, parentheses, or one of the quote characters described below 
    (except for the equals sign, which can occur in a word).
    
    these are words

    When a word is executed it looks up the value bound to that word. If the
    value is a function, then the function is applied and any arguments of the
    function are taken from the stack. If the value is not a function then the
    value itself is pushed onto the stack. 

QUOTES
    There are certain symbols that, when immediately preceding a word, change
    the normal evaluation behavior. Normally when a word occurs in an
    expression, the value bound to the word symbol is looked up and applied.
    For example, when a word appears by itself like this:
        sin 
    The interpreter looks up the value bound to the 'sin symbol, which is a
    function, and applies it.

    If a word is preceded by backquote, the interpreter looks up the value bound
    to the symbol without applying it.
        `sin
    The function bound to the 'sin symbol will be pushed onto the stack instead
    of being applied.
    
    If a word is preceded by single quote, the interpreter pushes the symbol
    itself onto the stack.
        'sin
    
    If a word is preceded by comma, the interpreter pops the object on top of the
    stack, looks up the value bound to the symbol in the object, and pushes that
    value onto the stack.
        ,name
    
    If a word is preceded by dot, the interpreter looks up the value bound to
    the symbol in the object on top of the stack, and applies it.
        .name
        
    If a word is preceded by the equals sign, the interpreter binds a value to a
    symbol in the current scope. The current scope extends to the next closing
    square bracket. There are no mutable local variables. Symbols once bound may
    not be changed except at the outer-most scope (the workspace). It is not
    possible to bind values to symbols outside the current scope.
        
        123 = x
 
	You can bind multiple values from the stack using parentheses after the = sign.
	This saves having to pop them off and bind them in reverse order.

		1 2 3 = (a b c)    ; is equivalent to:   1 2 3 = c = b = a
		a b c --&gt; 1 2 3

	You can bind values from lists using square brackets after the = sign.

		[1 2 3 4 5] = [a b c]
		a b c --&gt; 1 2 3
	
		#[1 2 3 4 5] = [a b c]  ; also works for signals. Don't use # on the right hand side.
		a b c --&gt; 1 2 3
	
	Don't get clever though:

	[1 2][3 4] = ([a b][c d])  ; syntax error. nested destructuring is not supported.
    
    
FUNCTIONS

    Functions are a backslash followed by a list of argument names, followed by
    a function body within square brackets.
    
    \a b [a b + a b *]
    
    When the interpreter encounters a function in the code, it creates an instance
    of the function that captures the free variables of the function and pushes that
    onto the stack. It does not apply the function.
    A function may be applied using the ! operator.
    
    3 4 \a b [a b + a b *] !  --&gt;  7 12
    
    The function may be assigned to a word.
    
    \a b [a b + a b *] = blub
    3 4 blub  --&gt;  7 12
    
    Optionally, a help string may follow the function arguments.
    
    \a b 
        "(a b --&gt; sum product) returns the sum and product of a and b." 
        [a b + a b *]
    
    Unlike other concatenative languages, the body of a function is executed on 
    an empty stack. Values from the calling stack are not accessible except via 
    the named arguments.
    
LISTS

    Lists are created by writing expressions within square brackets. The
    expressions are evaluated and the items left on the stack become the
    elements of the list.
    
    [1 2 3]
    
    [1 2 + 3 4 *]  --&gt;  [3 12]
    
    [2 aa 3 ba]  --&gt;  [2 3 2]

    There are two types of lists, value lists aka "streams" and numeric lists
    aka "signals". Signals are defined using an initial '#' character as follows.
    
    #[1 2 3]
    
    #[1 2 + 3 4 *]  --&gt;  #[3 12]

FORMS
    Also known as dictionary, map, or record, a Form is a set of bindings from keys 
    to values. Forms may inherit from other forms.
    Forms are enclosed in curly braces. Keys are preceeded by colons.
    
    { :a 1 :b 2 } = x    ; the value 1 is bound to the key a, and the value 2 is 
                         ; bound to the key b.
    
    { x :c 3 } = y       ; y inherits from x and binds the value 3 to the key c.
    
    The position of keys is actually completely arbitrary within the braces. It is 
    only required that the number of values pushed onto the stack equals, or in the 
    case of inheritance exceeds by one, the number of keys.
    
    So the following are completely equivalent to the above:
    
    {1 2 :a :b} = x
    {x 3 :c} = y

    {:a :b 1 2} = x
    {:c x 3} = y

    This can be useful when returning multiple values from functions and binding 
    them to multiple keys. In general, I would recommend the first syntax above for 
    most cases.
    
    Multiple inheritance is supported by specifying a list of parents.
    Multiple inheritance is an experimental feature and may be removed since it
    prevents certain optimizations that may prove more useful.
    Parent objects are ordered according to an algorithm defined for
    the Dylan programming language[6].

    {:a 1} = a
    {a :b 2} = b
    {a :c 3} = c
    {[b c] :d 4} = d        ; inherit first from b then from c.
    d --&gt; {{{{:a 1}  :c 3}  :b 2}  :d 4}   ; b is reached before c in traversal.
                                           ; a is inherited from only once.

AUTO-MAPPING

    Many built-in operators which take a scalar argument will automatically map
    over a signal or stream passed in that argument position. For example, the
    "to" operator returns a sequence from a starting number to an ending number:
    
        0 4 to  --&gt;  [0 1 2 3 4]
        
    If a list is passed as one of the arguments, then that list is auto-mapped
    and a list of lists is returned.
    
        [0 2] 4 to  --&gt;  [[0 1 2 3 4][2 3 4]]
        
        0 [2 3 4] to  --&gt;  [[0 1 2][0 1 2 3][0 1 2 3 4]]
        
    If lists are passed in for multiple arguments that are subject to
    auto-mapping, then they will be auto-mapped with successive values from each
    of the arguments.
    
        [0 7][2 9] to  --&gt;  [[0 1 2][7 8 9]]
        
    When multiple arguments are auto-mapped, the result will be of the same
    length as the shortest list.
    
        [0 1][5 4 3] to  --&gt;  [[0 1 2 3 4 5][1 2 3 4]]
        
    Auto-mapping may be performed over infinite lists. ord is a function which 
    returns an infinite list of integers starting with 1. 
        ord --&gt; [1 2 3 4 5 ...]
    
        0 ord to  --&gt;  [[0 1][0 1 2][0 1 2 3][0 1 2 3 4][0 1 2 3 4 5]...]

THE "EACH" OPERATOR

    Sometimes an operator needs to be applied at a deeper level than the top
    level. The @ sign, known as the "each" operator, tags the top value on the
    stack so that the next function that consumes it will operate over each of
    its values instead of the list as a whole.
    
    For example say we have the following nested list:
    
        [[1 2 3] [4 5 6]]
        
    If we reverse it we get the outer list reversed:
    
        [[1 2 3] [4 5 6]] reverse  --&gt;  [[4 5 6] [1 2 3]]
        
    What if we want to reverse each of the inner lists? We use the each
    operator:
    
        [[1 2 3] [4 5 6]] @ reverse  --&gt;  [[3 2 1] [6 5 4]]
    
    We can use the each operator to do outer products. Normally math operators
    proceed over lists element-wise like so:
    
        [1 2][10 20] +   --&gt;   [11 22]
    
    If we use the each operator we can apply + to each element of one list and
    the whole other list.
    
        [1 2] @ [10 20] +  --&gt;  [[11 21] [12 22]]
        
        [1 2] [10 20] @ +  --&gt;  [[11 12] [21 22]]
        
    This works because math operators auto-map over lists. 
    Other operators do not auto-map over lists, for example the 2ple operator.
    2ple creates a two item list from the two items on the top of the stack.
    
        [1 2] [10 20] 2ple  --&gt;  [[1 2] [10 20]] 

        [1 2] @ [10 20] 2ple  --&gt;  [[1 [10 20]] [2 [10 20]]]
        
        [1 2] [10 20] @ 2ple  --&gt;  [[[1 2] 10] [[1 2] 20]]
        
        [1 2] @ [10 20] @ 2ple --&gt; [[1 10] [2 20]]
        
    In order to do an outer product we need to use ordered each operators. These
    perform nested loops.
    
        [1 2] @1 [10 20] @2 2ple  --&gt;  [[[1 10] [1 20]] [[2 10] [2 20]]]
        
        [1 2] @2 [10 20] @1 2ple  --&gt;  [[[1 10] [2 10]] [[1 20] [2 20]]]
        
        
    You can do mapping two (or more) levels deep with @@ (or @@@, @@@@, etc) :
    
        [[[1 2 3] [4 5]] [[6 7] [8 9 10]]] @@ reverse  
            --&gt;  [[[3 2 1] [5 4]] [[7 6] [10 9 8]]]
    
    ord @1 ord @2 to   --&gt; an infinite list of infinite lists of finite lists:
        [
            [[1] [1 2] [1 2 3] [1 2 3 4] [1 2 3 4 5] ...] 
            [[2 1] [2] [2 3] [2 3 4] [2 3 4 5] ...] 
            [[3 2 1] [3 2] [3] [3 4] [3 4 5] ...] 
            [[4 3 2 1] [4 3 2] [4 3] [4] [4 5] ...] 
            [[5 4 3 2 1] [5 4 3 2] [5 4 3] [5 4] [5] ...] 
            ...
        ]

    Lists of Forms can be constructed using the each operator.
    
    {:a ord @ :b 0}  --&gt;  [{:a 1 :b 0} {:a 2 :b 0} {:a 3 :b 0} {:a 4 :b 0} ...]
    
    {:a 1 3 to @1  :b 1 4 to @2}  --&gt;          ; outer product
        [
            [{:a 1  :b 1} {:a 1  :b 2} {:a 1  :b 3} {:a 1  :b 4}]
            [{:a 2  :b 1} {:a 2  :b 2} {:a 2  :b 3} {:a 2  :b 4}]
            [{:a 3  :b 1} {:a 3  :b 2} {:a 3  :b 3} {:a 3  :b 4}]
        ]
        
    Lists of lists can be created using the each operator within the list
    constructor syntax:
    
    [[1 2 3] @ 4 5] --&gt; [[1 4 5] [2 4 5] [3 4 5]]
    
    [[1 2 3] @1 [4 5 6] @2] --&gt; 
            [[[1 4] [1 5] [1 6]] [[2 4] [2 5] [2 6]] [[3 4] [3 5] [3 6]]]

MULTI-CHANNEL EXPANSION

    Multi-channel expansion is a kind of auto-mapping for operators that process
    signals and not streams (for example, unit generators). These operators auto-map
    over streams, but not signals.
    
    ; the saw oscillator expands over the list [300 301] to produce stereo
    ; channels that beat with each other at 1 Hz.
    [300 301] 0 saw .3 * play
    
REDUCING AND SCANNING MATH OPERATORS

    For all two argument math operators, adding a forward slash after the
    operator turns it into a list reducing operator and adding a backward slash
    turns it into a list scanning operator.
    
    1 2 + --&gt; 3   normal addition
    [1 2 3 4] +/  --&gt; 10    sum
    [1 2 3 4] +\  --&gt; [1 3 6 10]   accumulation
    
    [1 2 3 4] */  --&gt; 24    product
    [1 2 3 4] *\  --&gt; [1 2 6 24]   scan of multiplication
    
    Adding a caret after the operator makes it work in pair-wise fashion. It
    outputs the first value, then outputs the operator applied to successive
    pairs.
    [1 2 3 4 5 6] +^     --&gt; [1 3 5 7 9 11]
    
    -^ and +\ are inverses of each other.
    [7 9 16 20 1 5] -^   --&gt; [7 2 7 4 -19 4]        pairwise difference
    [7 2 7 4 -19 4] +\   --&gt; [7 9 16 20 1 5]        accumulation

      <p>Israel
has always maintained that it had the capacity to destroy Iran’s nuclear
programme on its own, but it is also no secret that only America possessed the
massive ordnance capable of dealing with the strongest levels of protection,
particularly at Fordo, built deep inside a mountain.</p><p>If
the sites are now indeed out of use, then there may be an opportunity for
Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to declare his main war aim
complete.  </p><p>But
this morning the Middle East will be holding its breath, waiting to see whether
this marks the beginning of the end of this conflict, or the beginning of an
even more deadly phase to the war.</p><p>Last
week Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei had vowed to hit back at the US were it to enter the
war. “The Americans should know that any US military intervention will
undoubtedly be accompanied by irreparable damage,” he said.</p><p>Only
on Saturday the Houthi group in Yemen - staunch Iranian allies - had threatened
to attack US ships transiting through the Red Sea if America entered the war.</p><figure><p><span><img alt="Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei speaks in a televised message following the Israeli strikes, in Tehran, Iran, June 18" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/640/cpsprodpb/vivo/live/images/2025/6/22/b88a9733-21a7-44b2-9ac0-eca661c26ad1.jpg.webp" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/vivo/live/images/2025/6/22/b88a9733-21a7-44b2-9ac0-eca661c26ad1.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/vivo/live/images/2025/6/22/b88a9733-21a7-44b2-9ac0-eca661c26ad1.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/vivo/live/images/2025/6/22/b88a9733-21a7-44b2-9ac0-eca661c26ad1.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/vivo/live/images/2025/6/22/b88a9733-21a7-44b2-9ac0-eca661c26ad1.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/vivo/live/images/2025/6/22/b88a9733-21a7-44b2-9ac0-eca661c26ad1.jpg.webp 800w" width="1000" height="563"></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Reuters</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei speaks in a televised message following the Israeli strikes in Tehran on June 18</p></figcaption></figure>

<h2 id="laborberlinstate-of-the-art_16mm_projector">LaborBerlin: State-of-the-Art 16mm Projector</h2>


<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<div>

<p>
While artists all over the world continue to work with celluloid film, they are often confronted with precarious screening conditions due to increasingly old and hard to repair equipment. In particular, film projectors and their aging mechanical parts have become less dependable, contributing in many cases to the destruction of the film material instead of ensuring its optimal presentation. The last 16mm commercially available film projector was built in the 90’s but most artists, archivists and projectionists have to deal with much older equipment, sometimes going back to the 60’s and 50’s. At the same time, the traditional industrial manufacturers have disappeared or shifted to other fields, service personnel have retired and spare parts are rare and unreasonably priced. Designed mainly for standard film projections, vintage projectors also fail to cater to contemporary demands: While not offering enough flexibility for artists who work in expanded cinema, they also don’t usually meet the needs of archival projection. Along with the digital revolution, which has, in the last decade, already greatly reduced the opportunities for experiencing analogue film projection, the aging technology of vintage projection equipment has become an important factor in the disappearance of analogue film projection and the uniqueness of its experience.
</p>



</div>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<div>

<p>
Our idea is to develop a state-of-the-art and modular 16mm film projector using only open-source technologies and non-proprietary/commonly available spare parts. We believe that especially the central mechanical elements of the old projectors – claw mechanism, shutter wheel and film transport - are in most cases so well engineered that a new development here would be a waste of time and energy. Instead, we want to build the projector on the basis of an existing - and easily available - projector mechanism. The same applies to the optics: lenses that are compatible with projectors made by Eiki, Bauer, Bell &amp; Howell and Hokushin are available worldwide in good condition. This projector should cater to the needs of contemporary film artists, archivists and projectionists alike.

<h2 id="phase_i">PHASE I</h2>


<h2 id="state_of_the_project_march_2023">State of the Project – March 2023</h2>
<div>

<p>
Our project takes place over a period of two and a half years, and should be completed by September 2025 with the presentation of a prototype at the Back To The Future Festival in Rotterdam.
</p>

<p>
As a first step, in a team of two, we disassembled four film projector models, which we found offered a suitable mechanical system that could serve as the basis for further development. We have defined three fields of development, for which we will have to collaborate with different experts. These fields are light source, film transport mechanism and electronics.
</p>

<p>
But before we can take the next step, we also realised that we are at a junction where we first have to decide which path to take:
</p>

<p>
<strong>A. </strong>Develop a flexible upgrading system which suits various existing projector models. This would ensure that artists would be able to upgrade their own projector model, no matter where they live and what projector they own. Our concern is that it may be difficult to develop parts that can adapt with various existing mechanical parts.
</p>

<p>
<strong>B. </strong>Develop an upgrading system for only one widely available projector model. This would enable us to develop much more specific parts and create an integrated concept for that one type. The downside is that many projector models are not equally available in all parts of the world.
</p>

<p>
<strong>C. </strong>Develop a DIY-Kit, replicating mechanics from various existing models, using techniques like 3D-printing , CNC- and laser cutting. This would enable artists all over the world to build up their own, modular and state-of-the-art projector from scratch. Eventually we could provide and ship readymade parts that would be too difficult to produce individually.
</p>

<p>
Once this crucial decision has been made, we want to bring an expert in electromechanics on board to accompany the project through to the prototype. At the same time, we want to build an online community with whom we can share our ideas and who can also test and improve individual parts. We are already in contact with several people who are independently working on similar developments and who are waiting to finally share their knowledge and experiences with each other. In the end, we will hire an industrial designer to work with us in order to build a prototype.

<div>

<p>
In August 2023 we decided that before building a prototype, we first needed to find an LED light source that is capable of replacing the common 24V 250W halogen bulb. Chzech film artist Jan Kulka recommended high density LEDs from Chinese manufacturer <a href="https://www.getiangroup.com/specialty-white-cob-leds.html" title="https://www.getiangroup.com/specialty-white-cob-leds.html" rel="ugc nofollow">Getian</a>, which he has used for his <a href="https://www.pramitacka.cz/archeoscope.pdf" title="https://www.pramitacka.cz/archeoscope.pdf" rel="ugc nofollow">Archeoscope</a> expanded cinema machine. Over a period of 6 months we tested several LEDs with different Wattage, starting from 200W, then moving up to 400W, 600W and finally 800W. We based our decisions not only on the brightness but also on the size of the LED chips in relation to the 16mm projector gate.
</p>

<p>
In order to achieve comparable and realistic testing parameters, we took out a 16mm gate with lens holder from an old Bell &amp; Howell projector. We placed the LEDs as close as possible to the gate and step-by-step turned up the voltage in 0.5V increments. We then measured the temperature on the chip, and the brightness of the projection, using a lux meter.
</p>

<p>
After a few attempts we noticed that we were always reaching a critical temperature of 60°C (recommended by the manufacturer) even before the LEDs reached the rated power capacity and the highest brightness. We realised that we would have to find a more efficient cooling system then the computer processor heat sink with fan that we had started with. The next step to achieve more brightness was to try out water cooling. For our tests we chose a <a href="https://www.caseking.de/alphacool-eisbaer-aurora-360-cpu-complete-water-cooling-digital-rgb-360mm/WASE-452.html" title="https://www.caseking.de/alphacool-eisbaer-aurora-360-cpu-complete-water-cooling-digital-rgb-360mm/WASE-452.html" rel="ugc nofollow">water cooling system (AIO)</a> that is usually used for gaming computers. This actually allowed us to operate the LEDs with much higher voltage and up to their maximum capacities without over heating. Finally with an 800W LED we were able to reach close to twice the brightness of a 24V 250W halogen bulb.

<p>
After coming to the conclusion that the 800W LED was the most appropriate for our project, we decided that the next step should be to test the LED with a projector that had a working transport mechanism which would allow us to run a test film through the projector and check the quality of the projection. This would mean that we would have to find a projector that we would need to modify in order to fit the LED and cooler. This brought us back to the question of which path to take with the project in general. It became clear that in the time frame that we have for the project, it was most important to be able to test a system where we had variable control over the light and the transport mechanism and that we should focus first on these two parameters. That meant focusing on replacing the lamp and motor in an already existing projector instead of trying to design an entirely new projector from scratch or instead of trying to engineer a hybrid model with the best features of various projectors. So we decided to modify the Eiki RT model because of its availability, robust construction and the amount of space that it offered in the housing for modifications. The simplicity of its transport mechanism was also the factor as well as the idea that the modifications we would make could be easily reproduced by others.
</p>

<p>
At this stage we decided to bring in somebody with more expertise with projector construction and modification. Based on his experience building his own custom projection devices we asked <strong>Jan Kulka</strong> from Prague to join our team and continue the development of the prototype with us. In April 2024 we met in Berlin and decided on the next steps to follow. Even though our wish list contains a vast number of possible functions, we decided to focus initially on replacing the motor and installing a flickering LED Lamp that would replace the mechanical shutter.

<h2 id="st_prototype_with_800w_led_water_cooling_variable_fps_shutter_blades_angle">1st Prototype with 800W LED, water cooling, variable FPS, shutter blades &amp; angle</h2>
<div>

<p>
<br>
<strong>Jan Kulka </strong>took over the technical engineering of our first prototype. The aim was to modify an Eiki RT-2 projector and implement the following features:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p> The prototype should be capable of projecting 16mm film at variable frame rates from 0 - 30FPS</p>
</li>
<li><p> Our 800W high density LED should be installed, cooled by an AiO water cooling system to avoid blowing the LED or burning the film</p>
</li>
<li><p> The original shutter wheel should be replaced by an entire digital approach through flickering the LED</p>
</li>
<li><p> The prototype should be ready to be presented at ALUD festival in Barcelona by end of October 2024</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
At this point of time, we knew that our SPECTRAL project partners from Mire (Nantes) had already appointed experts for their “wandering devices project” to work out a modification of the same projector model, similar to what we had in mind. Their design, created by Zach Poff, Stefan Voglsinger, Guillermo Tellechea &amp; Loic Verdillon can be seen here: <a href="https://www.filmlabs.org/wiki/en/meetings_projects/spectral/mire-wandering/wandering-16mmprojection/start" title="https://www.filmlabs.org/wiki/en/meetings_projects/spectral/mire-wandering/wandering-16mmprojection/start" rel="ugc nofollow">Wandering 16mm projector retrofit</a>. Since all four devices projects within the SPECTRAL project are meant to be open source and to be replicated and improved by others, we decided to take over larger parts of their concept as a basis for our prototype. So we discussed with Jan that it would make sense to take over the code, the choice of the encoder, the motor model and the ‘virtual shutter’ system from their wandering devices project. This would give us more time and capacities to focus on the implementation of the 800W high density LED and the AiO water cooling system.
</p>

<p>
Jan decided to use only basic tools like a power drill, angle grinder and basic hand tools. Only in one case an ultrasonic saw had to be used. In order to make sure that anybody could do the same modification without the need for special machinery, no 3D printing or laser cutting were being used. Due to heat resistance reasons, most custom made parts were made of aluminum. Jan and the technicians he employed did a marvellous job as the following technical details and photos reveal:
</p>

<p>
<strong>1. Eiki RT-2 projector - original parts that have been removed</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li><p> mechanical shutter &amp; sill image clutch &amp; dowser</p>

</li>
<li><p> sound board</p>
</li>
<li><p> lower part of the body</p>
</li>
<li><p> to accommodate the hoses of the water cooler, some holes had to be drilled &amp; grinded into the inner part of the body</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>2. New light source</strong>
</p>
<ul>

<h2 id="feedback_loop_ii_25nd_oct_2024_at_alud_festival_barcelona">Feedback Loop II – 25nd Oct 2024 at ALUD Festival, Barcelona</h2>
<div>

<p>
<br>
As part of<strong> <a href="https://crater-lab.org/alud-4/" title="https://crater-lab.org/alud-4/" rel="ugc nofollow">¡Alud! #4</a></strong>, a festival organised by our project partner Crater Lab, which is entirely dedicated to expanded cinema, we presented our first prototype at a so-called feedback loop, a public gathering where makers &amp; experts are having a detailed look at the various technical achievements during the Devices project. All four groups showed their latest version of their <a href="https://www.filmlabs.org/wiki/en/meetings_projects/spectral/start" title="https://www.filmlabs.org/wiki/en/meetings_projects/spectral/start" rel="ugc nofollow">various prototypes</a> in an exhibition kind of set-up. A few participants who could not attend in person, like Zach Poff and Matt McWilliams in the US, were joining the discussion via streaming. The open and hands-on character of the event allowed a direct exchange of feedbacks about technical features and solutions between all participants, on-site as well as online. Due to our logistic restrictions across countries, this was the first opportunity for our research team to see our prototype in a direct, side-by-side comparison with a similar, unmodified projector model with the original 250W halogen bulb, both projecting the same film. It was amazing to see the brightness and versatility of our projector, nevertheless we also observed a few flaws. This is what we found:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Brightness: </strong>The projection of our prototype was much brighter compared to the 250W halogen projector</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Colours: </strong>Even though our 800W LED only has a CRI of 70, the colours looked saturated and vivid. The often debated importance of the CRI value doesn't seem to be as relevant in projection as it definitely is for scanning and colour grading in post production</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Features: </strong>All variable transport functionalities worked like a charm</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Optics: </strong>Since we are currently using an obscure condenser lens, we should work out a better optical system that can easily be replicated by anyone who wants to modify their own projector </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Mechanics: </strong>The projector seems to be very sensitive to tape splices, even though we took extra care to make sure they are accurate. Also Jan pointed out that he had come across one vintage film roll that didn't even get moved by the claw mechanism. Quick adjustments of the claw position did not solve the problem, we will have to do a complete CLA before we can go ahead. For the final release of our projector, we should also consider including sufficient information how to solve such problems</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Projection: </strong>Especially in the comparison with the original 250W halogen projector, we found the projected image flickering too much. In direct comparison, the much dimmer image of the halogen projector looks much smoother. This happens especially when the 800W LED is set to higher brightness. But the virtual number of shutter blades and the virtual shutter angle also play a big role in here</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
We discussed the possible reasons for the flicker:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Electronics: </strong>Zach Poff suggested that there could be a problem with the output from mosfet. We will have to measure with an oscilloscope whether there are any flaws in the electronics</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Sync: </strong>It could be a sync problem between the pull of the claw and the flicker of the LED, especially after the prototype had been shipped in a van over a distance of 1700 kms from Prague to Barcelona. The neodym magnet that is attached to the main shaft, only holds by its own magnetic force. So a microscopic shift of its position on the shaft could have caused a slight jitter in the projection</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Human perception:</strong> It is possible that with the brightness of our LED, we may have reached a certain threshold, at which the image flicker appears more apparent to the human eye. Matt McWilliams pointed out that back in the days when drive-in theatres in the US increased the brightness of their projections, they also upgraded from two to three shutter blades to compensate for the occurring flicker</p>
</li>
<li><p> It could be possible that all three reasons may be adding up upon each other and that way cause more flicker</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="addressing_flicker_issues_1st_march_2025">Addressing flicker issues – 1st March 2025</h2>
<div>

<p>
After the Feedback Loop in Barcelona we decided to first look into the flicker problems before going ahead with implementing more features in Phase IV. It turned out the the flicker was caused by several issues which were adding up upon each other. One major problem was the misalignment of the projector's pull-down claw mechanism. Due to poor reproduction quality, the service manual for Eiki RT series did not really help, but finally we found an online version of the <a href="http://www.k3camera.com/pdfs/eiki/2009-eiki-nt-nst-service-manual.pdf" title="http://www.k3camera.com/pdfs/eiki/2009-eiki-nt-nst-service-manual.pdf" rel="ugc nofollow">service manual for Eiki NT series</a> which gives very detailed instructions for cam tank adjustments (Page 27–31).
</p>

<p>
Another source for the flicker were minor fluctuations in the pulse output of the Mosfet HY 4306 semiconductor that switches the 800W LED. These fluctuations could be resolved by changing the code that is running the ESP-Wroom-32.

</p>

<p>
In order to get a real life impression of the projector's projection quality and capacities we decided that we need to see the projection in direct comparison with reference 16mm film projectors. We met at a screening room in Berlin and set up four projectors side-by-side. We fixed further minor mechanical issues and projected two (almost) equal film prints of a well preserved corporate film about land mapping and road construction.
</p>

<p>
Later we used a lux meter to measure the projection brightness at a distance of approx. 10 meter from the screen All projectors were running at their native 24 fps frame rate and equipped with an Isco Vario Kiptaron 1.3 / 35-65mm lens:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>State-of-the-Art 16mm Prototype</strong> – LED 800 W – 2 virtual blades                           530 Lux   (white with minimal pink tint?)</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Eiki EX-2000 N2</strong> – Xenon lamp 350 W – 2 shutter blades                                          480 Lux   (green tint)</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Eiki SSL-2 (Super Slim Slot Load)</strong> – halogen lamp 250 W – 2 shutter blades         410 Lux   (yellow tint)</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Eiki RT-2</strong> – halogen lamp 200 W – 2 shutter blades                                                   305 Lux   (orange tint)</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Even though it helped using two (almost) equal film prints of the same film for comparison, it turned out that both prints were very different in colour tint and sharpness. Swapping prints and lenses systematically finally helped us understand that our prototype delivers a slightly brighter, sharper and much whiter image compared to the Eiki EX-2000 N2 Xenon Projector.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I friggin' <em>love</em> Balatro. I've put an embarrassing number of hours into it. I also like to make games for the Nintendo E-Reader. The E-Reader was a peripheral for the Game Boy Advance that let you load mini games and "DLC" by scanning cards into it.</p><figure><img src="https://mattgreer.dev/_next/static/media/Ereader.74808f7f.png"><figcaption>The E-Reader attached to a Game Boy Advance (image by Nintendo)</figcaption></figure><p>Oh and Balatro is a single player solitaire/poker hybrid game that is super fun. If you enjoy poker, solitaire, or especially trading card games like Magic the Gathering or Pokemon, you should definitely check it out if you haven't already.</p><p>A while back, I made this mock up screenshot of what Balatro might look like on the
E-Reader.</p><figure><img src="https://mattgreer.dev/_next/static/media/balatroMockup.cc0cdefa.png"><figcaption>A mock up of Balatro on the E-Reader</figcaption></figure><p>This mock up was really fun to make. So I decided to take it one step further and make a working prototype of the game. This was also a blast to make!</p><iframe height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mhmxfF1fxpQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>This prototype is <em>almost</em> entirely real. It's a real E-Reader game, and it really plays Balatro. I only implemented just what you see in the video, so it's a very long way away from being a full port of the game.</p><p>I said it's almost entirely real because it does fake a few things. The blind selection screen is entirely a mock. You just press A and go into the round.</p><figure><img src="https://mattgreer.dev/_next/static/media/prototypeBlindsScreen.863a3ea0.png"><figcaption>The blind selection screen is completely mocked</figcaption></figure><p>And when you win the round, the win screen is mocked too. You have to win with two remaining hands for it to be believable :)</p><figure><img src="https://mattgreer.dev/_next/static/media/prototypeWinScreen.d6003ca8.png"><figcaption>The blind selection screen is completely mocked</figcaption></figure><p>But playing the game within the round is 99% real. I hard coded Fibonacci and Splash jokers, and when it calculates what type of hand was played, it only knows about "duplicative" style hands (ie two pair, full house, three of a kind, etc). My wife was sad to find her straight only got scored as a high card. Doh. Many other things are missing too, but this was mostly due to not wanting to spend too much time on this project more than anything.</p><h2 id="could-it-be-done">Could it be done?</h2><p>Would it be possible to make Balatro for the E-Reader? I think so.</p><p>It would be a challenging project and a good number of concessions would need to be made. But I do think a demaked version that still captures the essence and fun of the game is doable.</p><h3 id="dealing-with-high-scores">Dealing with high scores</h3><p>An immediate challenge would be the massive scores you can get in Balatro. E-Reader games can comfortably work with 32 bit numbers. So the highest possible score would be 4,294,967,295. Real Balatro uses 64 bit numbers so scores can absolutely go into the stratosphere there. But I think 4 billion is still plenty to have fun and get that Balatro experience.</p><p>There's more bad news here. We'll talk about it below in the small numbers section.</p><p>But ... the Game Boy Advance's screen is only 240x160 pixels, so fitting such large numbers onto the screen would be a challenge. This is an area the demake would have to be different from the real thing. Something like this would be needed (just a quick mock up).</p><figure><img src="https://mattgreer.dev/_next/static/media/newUiForLargerScores.b3b4749d.png"><figcaption>A UI change to accomodate larger scores</figcaption></figure><h3 id="so-many-numbers">So many numbers</h3><p>Balatro puts a lot of numbers on the screen.</p><ul><li>Number of remaining hands</li><li>Number of remaining discards</li><li>Current ante</li><li>Current round</li><li>How many cards remain in the deck</li><li>How large the deck is</li><li>The level of the hand that is being played</li><li>The current chip total</li><li>The current mult total</li><li>Your money</li><li>Your score so far in the round</li><li>Your score for the current hand</li><li>The goal score to beat the round</li></ul><p>Did I miss any? The E-Reader has a collection of <a tabindex="0" href="https://ereader.miraheze.org/wiki/ERAPI-Z80#0x6b:_DrawNumber"><code>DrawNumber</code></a> functions, but the problem is it is limited to four unique numbers. If you try to draw a fifth number with <code>DrawNumber</code>, nothing happens.</p><p>Even worse, each number can have a max of 5 digits. So just to keep track of your score, would take up 2 of those number slots.</p><p>A lot of this can be worked around with sprites and some clever redesigning and careful pruning back of features (this would be a demake after all). I do think this challenge could be overcome, but it would probably be the hardest part of this project.</p><h3 id="150-jokers">150 jokers?</h3><p>Balatro has 150 jokers, and they all do very different things. I think making a full fledged "joker engine" that can handle this is doable. The E-Reader/GBA has plenty of memory for this, and it's easy to dynamically call functions. So logic-wise, I don't think this would be a problem. But each joker needs a card graphic.</p><figure><img src="https://mattgreer.dev/_next/static/media/jokers.e69394c8.png"><figcaption>Five Joker cards in the demaked style</figcaption></figure><p>That would really add up and take up a ton of space. Space is always a concern with E-Reader games. Make no doubt, Balatro on the E-Reader would be a very large game by E-Reader standards. But I'm certain fitting all 150 jokers would not be possible. A careful sub-selection of jokers would need to be picked.</p><h3 id="text">Text</h3><p>Balatro has a ton of text in it. Similar to games like Magic the Gathering, the rules of the game are literally written out on the cards. Balatro uses little text pop outs for this, but it's still the same idea.</p><figure><img src="https://mattgreer.dev/_next/static/media/wee.2b09105a.png"><figcaption>The Wee Joker showing its rules pop up</figcaption></figure><p>There would be no way to include all this text into an E-Reader demake. So unfortunately the demake would only be playable by people who are familiar with the main game. I dunno, that doesn't really bother me. This is the type of project that's just done for the sake of it.</p><h3 id="running-out-of-sprites">Running out of sprites</h3><p>In Balatro it's possible to have many jokers, and a large hand. Here is a very extreme example, but it gets the idea across.</p><figure><img src="https://mattgreer.dev/_next/static/media/manyCards.ce68c0b2.png"><figcaption>A game of Balatro with many jokers and a very large hand</figcaption></figure><p>The E-Reader only supports 56 sprites. I think for space saving, a card would have to be made out of two (and sometimes three) sprites each.</p><figure><img src="https://mattgreer.dev/_next/static/media/threeSpritesOneCard.5303a6af.svg"><figcaption>A single card made out of three sprites</figcaption></figure><p>Working within this limitation would be very challenging. Fortunately it is possible to use backgrounds here instead of sprites. In my prototype, your hand at the bottom of the screen is a background (similarly, in my <a tabindex="0" href="https://mattgreer.dev/blog/cramming-solitaire-onto-a-nintendo-ereader-card/">E-Reader solitaire game</a>, all of the cards are drawn into a background instead of using sprites). That can help a lot. But even with backgrounds, this would be challenging. The demake might have to impose a limit on how big your hand can be and/or how many jokers you can have.</p><h3 id="space-considerations">Space considerations</h3><p>Space is always a challenge with this device. The prototype ended up being four data strips, in other words two cards.</p><figure><img src="https://mattgreer.dev/_next/static/media/exoCards.89feb592.jpg"><figcaption>An example E-Reader game that is spread across two cards</figcaption></figure><p>But I also wasn't worried about space here, I just built the prototype without worrying how large it ended up being. If you work at it, you can get your E-Reader games a lot smaller with clever coding techniques. So although I'm pretty sure Balatro would be a large game (maybe 8 cards? 10? The max of 12?), running out of space such that this idea ends up not possible doesn't worry me.</p><h3 id="small-numbers">Small numbers</h3><p>Uh oh, this is a bad one. The GBA can not natively handle decimal numbers, like <code>.25</code> or <code>1.1</code>. There are a few ways to work around this, but none of them are great.</p><h4 id="work-around-idea-1-use-fixed-point-numbers">Work around idea 1: Use fixed point numbers</h4><p>A work around for this problem has been used on old computers since forever. It's called fixed point, and it's a way to do decimal numbers like <code>1.5</code> on systems that don't support them natively. I won't get into the details here as it's fairly technical (I wrote two blog posts on it <a tabindex="0" href="https://mattgreer.dev/blog/neo-geo-dev-fixed-point/">here</a> and <a tabindex="0" href="https://mattgreer.dev/blog/ereader-simple-fixed-point/">here</a> if you are curious). This approach has the advantage of being simple, but has the major disadvantage of reducing the largest number we can work with. That 4 billion above would likely be reduced to 1 billion or even half a billion. Ugh. And on the flip side, this approach has accuracy problems, it could do say <code>1.5</code> pretty easily, but <code>1.1</code> would probably have to be rounded to <code>1.25</code> or <code>1</code>.</p><h4 id="work-around-idea-2-software-floating-point">Work around idea 2: software floating point</h4><p>Floating point is the name of the number system that modern systems (and Balatro) use to do decimal numbers. It's much better than fixed point. On modern computers, it is always implemented in hardware, because it's very complicated. Technically it would probably be possible to implement a software version of floating point in the E-Reader, but my word it'd be one hell of a project and slow as molasses. This one just doesn't seem realistic to me.</p><h4 id="work-around-3-just-use-integers">Work around 3: just use integers</h4><p>Integers are whole numbers, like <code>1</code>, <code>40</code> and so on. All computers support this type of number. This is by far the easiest and fastest approach. But it would likely mean ditching jokers like Hologram, Vampire and Lucky Cat. Some of the coolest jokers in the game :(</p><figure><img src="https://mattgreer.dev/_next/static/media/hologram.73aed2cd.png"><figcaption>Hologram we'd miss you!</figcaption></figure><p>Oh, and then there is the problem of drawing decimal numbers to the screen. The E-Reader's <code>DrawNumber</code> functions work with whole numbers only ...</p><p>Make no doubt about it, decimal numbers are a big hurdle in making a Balatro demake. If I were to actually make this game, I'd probably choose the fixed point approach for this problem.</p><h2 id="just-make-a-real-gba-game">Just make a real GBA game?</h2><p>Why do this on the E-Reader if it is so limited? No other reason than I really like the device and have a soft spot for it. If the demake was instead made as a full fledged GBA game on a cartridge, it'd have a bit more breathing room to work through these issues. Many limitations would remain though, like the 240x160 screen and decimal numbers. The GBA can work with 128 sprites, which is better than the 56 of the E-Reader, but still pretty limiting. My hunch is doing this as a proper GBA game would only make it a little bit easier.</p><h2 id="anyway--will-i-release-the-prototype">Anyway ... will I release the prototype?</h2><p>No, I won't. At least, not without LocalThunk's approval. This was just for fun, and I made it entirely on my own. Balatro is an excellent game, so I don't want to cause it any harm (or at least surprise) by releasing a demake of it, even if it's just a tiny little prototype. You really aren't missing anything, everything that is possible in the prototype is shown in the video. Oh, the prototype can also sort the cards by rank or suit. Yup, that's the entirety of it.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Thanks for reading!

                  <p>I think the Chinese law is effective in this regard: in order to maintain any non-competition agreement, the company must continue to pay you a monthly compensation amount equal to 30% of your total monthly income when you were at the company. Whenever the payment stops, the non-competition agreement is automatically void.</p>

                  <p>WA is busy losing its way on taxation vs value provided for taxes paid and reporting burden. so imo these IP issues are almost second order effects at this point. i personally expect a continued exodus over some of the latest tax hikes for example taxing cap gains beyond a certain amount at an additional 7%. as if niit was not bad enough.  if residents could at least see some value from these added taxes maybe it could be something. also the estste tax there kicks in quickly and has hidden gotchas even for people who no longer live there.</p>

                  <p>I'm not sure what conclusions you think we should draw from that. California's advantage over Washington is primarily one of size - Washington's GDP per capita is actually about 3% higher than California's. The most generous interpretation I can think of is that you're crediting the non-compete difference for California's far larger population, which is tenuous at best.</p>

                  <p>So happy my union managed to ban broad non-competes in my country ~8 years ago. Now it needs to be <i>very</i> specific if they want to enforce it (not just "development work in the same industry" which most contracts had back when I graduated), only applicable for maximum a year, and they have to pay your salary for the time they stop you working somewhere else.</p>

                  <p>How is a union any different in that respect than a corporation? I mean on a theoretical level. A true free-market firm would just be an association of individuals making individually negotiated transactions, with no employee-employer relationship, and no coordination on the side of purchasing labor. Of course that's very inefficient outside of pure theory. A corporation acts as a coordinating body that collectively negotiates the purchasing of labor contracts, and a union collectively negotiates on the selling side.</p>

                  <p>If I understand it right, those NDAs work as non-competes if “confidential” is defined as restricted just on the basis of some relationship to the business, which is pretty weird attack of legalese on common sense. Let’s say I used some relatively simple chain of thought to derive X about my job at Z. The fact that Z uses or does X is probably confidential, and that’s ok. This would be how I understood a broad definition. But what kind of reasoning would conclude that X is confidential per se, preventing me to use or do X elsewhere, effectively making doing my job impossible? It just doesn’t make sense.</p>

                  <p>Precisely. And, at least in the US, any contract which makes it impossible for a worker to take a new job in their field is extremely likely to be found unconscionable. It doesn't matter whether the contract is cast as a non-compete or as a NDA; if its effect is to say "you must work for us, or not at all", it's unlikely to hold up.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <p>On the heels of the disastrous House reconciliation bill’s passage, Senate Republicans have unveiled their own poisonous version of the bill that will fund President Trump’s agenda—a bill that calls for the outright sale of public lands as a key element.</p>
<p>The provision in question mandates the disposal of between 2 million and 3 million acres of lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service across 11 states: Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming. Alarmingly, the provision contains very limited exemptions—Wilderness Study Areas, Areas of Critical Environmental Concern, roadless areas and critical habitat are all considered eligible for sale. <strong>Based on those limited restrictions, more than 250 million acres of public lands will be eligible to be sold to "any interested party."</strong></p>
<p>To illustrate just how much is at stake, we’ve created a map of all public lands that are now at risk of disposal.</p>
