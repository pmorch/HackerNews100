<h3>How much do publishers earn from ad impressions?</h3>
<p>The amount of money an ad impression generates varies significantly across display mediums and content categories.</p>
<p>But we can get a good heuristic from <a href="https://adsense.google.com/start/#calculator">Google's AdSense estimated revenue calculator</a>.</p>
<p>The calculator gives you an estimate for your annual ad revenue potential based upon your content category (Finance, Games, Health, etc...) and your monthly page views.</p>
<p>For example, putting in 50k page views a month, with a Finance category, gives a potential yearly earnings of $2,000.</p>
<p>I'm going to take the <strong>median</strong> across all categories, which is an estimated annual revenue of $1,550 for 50,000 monthly page views.</p>
<p>This is approximately <strong>~$0.00022 earned per page view</strong>.</p>
<h3>How much does it cost to generate AI content?</h3>
<p>Let's invent a blog that generates content in response to whatever the user types in the search bar.</p>
<p>We'll generate the article the user is looking for, on the fly. Will it be mostly nonsense? Probably. But let's go for it anyway, just to illustrate a point.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>user: "how to have my macbook audibly greet me whenever I flip it open"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In order to facilitate this, we'll wrap the user's query around a prompt.</p>
<p>Below is the prompt we'll use.</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>You are an excellent blog writer. You write blogs that rank well in search engines because you know about SEO and how to use highly relevant and popular keywords. Your blog posts are informative, and help users achieve what they are looking for.

You will receive queries from users searching for blog posts. You will create blog posts that matches their query, that are helpful, and that answer or are relevant to whatever they are searching for.

Respond with only the blog post.</code></pre></div>
<p>With this prompt, and the user query, we have <strong>119 input tokens</strong> according to <a href="https://platform.openai.com/playground/chat?models=gpt-4o-mini">OpenAI's Playground</a>.</p>
<p>The response generated by gpt4o-mini, is only <strong>829 output tokens</strong>.</p>

If you want your MacBook to greet you with a chime or a specific sound every time you flip it open, it’s a fun way to personalize your device and make your daily interactions a bit more exciting. While macOS doesn’t come with a built-in feature to audibly greet you immediately upon opening the lid, there are a few creative workarounds to achieve a similar effect. In this blog post, we will discuss a couple of methods you can set up for your MacBook to greet you audibly.

## Method 1: Setting Up a Startup Sound

1. **System Preferences:**
   - Go to the Apple menu in the upper-left corner of your screen.
   - Select **System Preferences**.
   - Click on **Sound** and then navigate to the **Sound Effects** tab.
   
2. **Enable Startup Sound:**
   - Make sure the option “Play sound on startup” is checked. This way, your MacBook will play the selected sound every time you start it up.
   - Note: This method will only play sound when the MacBook is fully powered down and then opened again.

While this method does not greet you specifically upon opening the lid from sleep mode, it’s effective for a full startup.

## Method 2: Create an Automator App for a Custom Greeting

For more customization, you can use the Automator app to create your own greeting sound that plays when the MacBook wakes from sleep.

### Steps to Create Your Greeting:

1. **Open Automator:**
   - Search for **Automator** in Spotlight Search or find it in the Applications folder.

2. **Create New Document:**
   - Choose **New Document** and select **Application**.

3. **Use the Run Shell Script Action:**
   - In the sidebar, find **Utilities** and drag the **Run Shell Script** action to the main area.

4. **Enter the AppleScript Command:**
   - Replace the default script with the following:
     ```bash
     osascript -e 'tell app "System Events" to say "Welcome back!"'
     ```

5. **Choose Your Sound:**
   - If you want a specific sound file instead of a spoken greeting, use the following command instead:
     ```bash
     afplay /path/to/your/soundfile.mp3
     ```
   - Make sure you replace `/path/to/your/soundfile.mp3` with the actual file path of your chosen audio file.

6. **Save Your Application:**
   - Go to **File &gt; Save**, and name it something like “Greeting Sound.” Ensure it is saved in the Applications folder.

### Automating the Greeting Sound:

1. **Open System Preferences:**
   - Go to **System Preferences** and select **Users &amp; Groups**.

2. **Select Your User Account:**
   - Click on your username and select the **Login Items** tab.

3. **Add Your Automator App:**
   - Click the **“+”** button and navigate to the Greeting Sound app you created. Add it to the list.

Now, whenever your MacBook wakes from sleep, your personalized greeting sound will play.

## More Personalization Options

- **Use a Different Voice:** If you used the text-to-speech option, you can change the voice in **System Preferences** &gt; **Accessibility** &gt; **Spoken Content**.
- **Add More Sounds:** You can repeat the process for multiple sounds or greetings by creating separate Automator apps.

## Conclusion

By using the methods outlined above, you can add a personal touch to your MacBook experience. Whether you choose the simple startup sound or get creative with an Automator app, these options allow you to greet your MacBook (and yourself) every time you open it. So, go ahead and set it up, and enjoy your daily welcome back!

<p>The cost to generate the article was <strong>$0.00051525</strong>. And it wasn't half-bad.</p>
<h3>Ad impression vs AI cost.</h3>
<p>You can probably see where I'm going with this now.</p>
<p>For that blog post, we might earn <strong>~$0.00022</strong> for the single page impression from the user that requested it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the blog post itself, had a cost of <strong>$0.00051525</strong> to generate.</p>
<p>We made a net profit of $0.00022 - $0.00051525 = <strong>$-0.00029525</strong>!</p>
<p>Woohoo, we lost money! We're going to be rich!</p>
<p>Joking aside, let's imagine that blog post receives <strong>only 5 page views</strong> throughout its entire lifetime, which is a pretty conservative estimate to make.</p>
<p>Now, we'll earn $0.00022 * 5 = <strong>$0.0011</strong>.</p>
<p>Subtracting our cost, $0.0011 - $0.00051525 = <strong>$0.00058475</strong>.</p>
<p>That's <strong>5.8 hundreths of a penny</strong>. Don't go spending it all in one place.</p>
<h2>Is this going to actually happen?</h2>
<p>Will the future of the internet be entirely dynamically generated AI blogs in response to user queries?</p>
<p>I don't know. I hope not. But the internet has been on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification">downward trend for a while now</a>.</p>
<p>Most of the internet is probably already SEO content blogspam generated by cheap copywriters.</p>
<h2>Is anyone doing this now?</h2>
<p>In a fun way, yes, check out <a href="https://websim.ai/">Websim</a> which uses LLMs to dynamically generate an alternative internet. It's a "web simulator" brought to you by AI.</p>
<p>They're not making money though. There aren't any ads (yet).</p></section><hr></article></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="blog-hero">
    
    <section>
        
<p>Here's a fair warning: this article is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum">reductio ad absurdum</a>, therefore you shouldn't take it as gospel. However, i do believe that this point of view is extreme enough that it usually gets shut down immediately, yet doesn't have any frank discussion about it, which makes it the perfect subject for me to write about! To reiterate, i'm not suggesting that you go out there after reading this and never update any of your production software, merely consider the points that are offered here.</p>
<p>So, as the article title suggests, you should never update anything. Not your OS. Not your libraries in your software project. Not your tools. What would make someone come to this controversial idea? Actually trying to do that, of course! </p>
<p>When you're telling your colleagues that you can't really work because Windows or JetBrains IDEs need to install some updates, they'll give you understanding, yet annoyed glances. When you tell clients that you cannot ship software because first you need to spend a few days or weeks refactoring software to keep up with the latest library releases, they will express their displeasure at you and will probably look elsewhere for someone who won't care about updates. When your company won't be the first to market, because about 20% of your total development capacity needs to spent on keeping up with the technical debt, which is slowly forced upon by the industry, while another 20% of the effort needs to go to writing and maintaining a test suite, the company will suffer as a result. And once you actually do get the buy-in to update the components and when it turns out that migrating from Spring to Spring Boot is actually a herculean effort that means carrying over about 50 dependencies of a legacy Java project that has about 1 million SLoC, during which you also discover that at least 20-30 of those are painfully out of date, then you'll just start writing blog posts like this.</p>
<p>My premise is that updates are a massive waste of time, most of the time. Obviously, someone will jump out and say that "Hey, if you don't update, your Windows XP installation will get added to a botnet in less than a week," and they'll also be right at the same time. </p>
<h3>Types of updates are the problem</h3>
<p>The problem here is that we never differentiate between the types of updates properly: </p>
<ul>
<li>major leaps in the development of the software which add new features</li>
<li>security updates that don't change any actual functionality apart from the security fix</li>
<li>bug fixes that should not alter any functionality in significant ways</li>
<li>small backwards compatible feature updates that are essentially opt in</li>
</ul>
<p>There are plenty of things that you might want to feasibly change and update without any of the other functionality being altered. Actually, the situation is so bad in that regard, that most if not all of our modern software only ever has feature updates which sooner or later will have breaking changes in them. Otherwise, if you wanted to eliminate the possibility of running into breaking changes entirely, the development of any library would look like this:</p>
<p><img alt="how updates would look" src="https://blog.kronis.dev/images/h/o/w/-/u/how-updates-would-look-aff7472e.jpeg"></p>
<p>In the image, we see that we have major releases (with the "V" prefix), for example, we'd have MySQL 5, that would eventually be updated to MySQL 6, MySQL 7 and MySQL 8 (which is funny, if you know anything about how that actually worked out). Esentially, you'd have a few large releases, that represent both new features being added, as well as breaking changes. Then, you have the minor versions which introduce new functionaly (with the "f" prefix) and patches (with the "s" prefix) which in this case would mean security fixes. </p>
<p>Essentially, i'm describing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning">semantic versioning</a>, where this scheme would be approximately <code>V.f.s</code>, where you have a clear distinction between the major, minor and patch versions. However, instead of abandoning minor releases, you'd have to keep them up to date, since in practice different minor releases are not always compatible. If you wanted to support all of the versions of your software without forcing your users to use the new features, it would mean maintaining a new instance of your codebase for every minor release in existence. And in this case we're also simplifying things, because we assume that the patch versions will never break anything, which would probably mean that we need to preserve non-security related bugs and only fix them across minor releases.</p>
<p>You'd have to backport any and all security fixes from your newest versions, should the older ones also be affected. For example, if you discover a problem in V5.2.15 and fix it in V5.2.16, then you'd have to port these changes back to the current V5.1.X version and V5.0.X version, which is probably doable when you have 3 releases, but less so with 30.</p>
<p>And it goes the other way around, if you discover a problem in one of your older releases and the newer ones are also affected, then you have to port the changes forwards. For example, if you discover a problem in V5.0.14 and fix it in V5.0.15, then you'd have to port these changes forwards to the current V5.1.X and V5.2.X versions, where you run into the same problem as above.</p>
<p>In practice, things almost never work like that because that necessitates too much work. If you tried doing that, your issue tracking software could look like this:</p>
<pre><code>Issue: MYSOFT-3401
Description: Security breakage in $FOO module.
Assignee: You
Status: Ready to test

Versions affected:
- V7.6.245
- V7.5.267
- ... (down to V7.0.X)
- V6.10.315
- V6.9.326
- ... (down to V6.0.X)
- V5.14.421
- V5.13.442
- ... (down to V5.0.X)

Fixed in:
- V7.6.246
- V7.5.268
- ... (down to V7.0.X)
- V6.10.316
- V6.9.327
- ... (down to V6.0.X)
- V5.14.422
- V5.13.443
- ... (down to V5.0.X)</code></pre>
<p>Of course, testing all of that would be interesting, as would fixing further issues. Imagine having to do this for every single bug report and change. You'd spend days if not weeks fixing even trivial bugs if you'd have to support every single release of your software. That's why a lot of companies just drop support for older packages and leave people with no updates at all in cases where a minor version actually does break something, which isn't as much solving the problem, as it is simply sweeping it under the rug. </p>
<p>I'm sure that some of them would perhaps want to update their older versions, but it simply isn't feasible, perhaps apart from supporting the major version as a whole and forcing people to update to the newest minor versions to keep getting support. So in reality, the list of supported versions would indeed be just the last minor releases in the first example above, which would look a bit like the following:</p>
<p><img alt="actual updates are more like" src="https://blog.kronis.dev/images/a/c/t/u/a/actual-updates-are-more-like-e7f2dfac.jpeg"></p>
<p>More doable, but still not good enough in my mind - minor versions are for new features, which you don't necessarily want. My experience shows that oftentimes these new and supposedly backwards compatible features still break old functionality. Perhaps it's due to some refactoring that was needed, other times there were bugs fixed that old code relied upon and assumed to be the right way to do things. </p>
<p>My pain is that you'll never actually know how far you can update, seeing as the breaking changes will get you sooner or later, even if it's supposed to just be a bug fix. In reality, you might find that you can only run your software with a subset of the released versions (orange being what you have now, green what you can update to without breakages, red being everything that won't work):</p>
<p><img alt="how far you can update without breakages" src="https://blog.kronis.dev/images/h/o/w/-/f/how-far-you-can-update-before-breakages-618dd6ac.jpeg"></p>
<p>Now, the understandable argument here is: "Breaking changes are inevitable, you should just update your code." which is fair, but at the same time kind of useless. The industry shows that there are still plenty of projects that are stuck with JDK 8 and MySQL 5.7, or even a better example, old PHP versions like 5.6.40 and realistically cannot be updated and eventually will receive no security updates either, because all of that is simply too hard. And good luck with trying to tell your clients that now you'll probably need to alter or rewrite a huge portion of your code that uses the now deprecated or removed packages - oftentimes they simply won't understand that code rots with time.</p>
<p>Worse yet, those that don't care about semantic versioning don't even attempt to keep track of all of this stuff - i've seen projects out there in the wild, where V6.9.0 is always followed by V7.0.0 and V7.0.1 is code for "we screwed up the previous release, so this is just a hotfix", plenty of people and orgs out there just look at version numbers like something to put in Jira and get paid for, rather than a measure of what the software is compatible with.</p>
<h3>Noone wants updates</h3>
<p>But that's just the tip of the iceberg. I think i've briefly described while backporting security fixes and such is pretty hard, even though some operating systems still try to do that. Now, here's a story about why updates are actually bad. In a word: breaking changes. In the aforementioned Spring migration, i updated the <a href="https://flywaydb.org/">Flyway</a> version and ran into the following message:</p>
<pre><code>org.flywaydb.core.internal.license.FlywayEditionUpgradeRequiredException: Flyway Teams Edition or Oracle upgrade required: Oracle OLD_VERSION is no longer supported by Flyway Community Edition, but still supported by Flyway Teams Edition.</code></pre>
<p>I think that this is the inevitable future of software. "Want support for older versions of stuff that you're stuck with because of organizational reasons beyond your control? Sure, pay us!" If you look at the pricing page, you actually see that you'd need to part with 3000 USD for that sort of a license:</p>
<p><img alt="flyway costs" src="https://blog.kronis.dev/images/f/l/w/a/y/flway-costs-0bd2cc78.jpeg"></p>
<p>Now, i'm using this as an example for intentionally breaking support for older versions in a way that will hopefully (from the company's point of view) lead to them dying off and therefore the companies won't need to explicitly support them for a long time, thus attempting to solve the problem above. However, there are also plenty of cases out there, where updates introduce other breaking changes, oftentimes being forced upon the user against their will!</p>
<p>For example, i want to use Flyway, but i don't want to be forced to use a version, which drops support for the DB that i need to use. And yet, i wasn't even consulted about this, since the newest version is mandated by Spring Boot:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.flywaydb&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;flyway-core&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</code></pre>
<p>There are plenty of cases out there like this as well! For example, Docker Desktop doesn't let you decide whether you want updates or not, unless you pay them:</p>
<p><img alt="docker desktop updates" src="https://blog.kronis.dev/images/d/o/c/k/e/docker-desktop-updates-6f750760.png"></p>
<p>And i'm sure that we've all also heard plenty of other horror stories of this very same trend, be it <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/670084/what-you-need-to-know-about-snaps-on-ubuntu-20.04/">Ubuntu forcing updates with snap packages</a>, or Windows 7 forcefully upgrading to newer releases when people step away from their computers for a bit.</p>
<p>In a word, the way how companies approach updates nowadays suck, especially when they break things!</p>
<h3>Updates are bad</h3>
<p>All you need to do is go to the "Everything is Broken" section of my blog and you will see plenty of cases of updates breaking things. In the current year, it's gotten to the point where i treat every update like a possibly completely clean wipe and install from nothing. Therefore, backups are of the utmost importance and every update needs to have at least an hour or two set aside for when things will inevitably go wrong, as they oftentimes have in the past.</p>
<p>But here's the thing - if i don't want to rely on <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.html">SaaSS</a>, then i have to host and manage my software by myself. If i want to do that, then i need to handle the updates myself as well. Every update takes a significant amount of time and potentially can break things. And, even more importantly, if there are any non-standard configuration changes done (even the theme of this very blog), then things become more likely to break and waste my time. But i don't have unlimited amounts of time. </p>
<p>Actually, i don't have enough time to do my day job, learn new technologies for when it inevitably becomes stale and would otherwise lead to my career death, to also help my aging parents around the countryside estate with various chores, at the same time educate myself on both things in the industry and news in the world, as well as spend anywhere between 1-2 hours working out every day (a weight loss and personal wellness effort which seems to be working and about which i'll write a post some day) and have any sort of enjoyment of life in general, for example, by reading a sci-fi book in the evenings.</p>
<p>Ergo, i cannot update. Ergo, companies cannot ship features AND handle all of the updates, without having enough tests to catch all of the problems, which they will never be able to do no matter how good their tests are without slowing down their development pace to the point where they are no longer competitive.</p>
<p>Breaking feature updates of any sort are a nuisance and a direct impediment to progress more often than they're not and the more updates there are to be done, the less will be done. So don't update!</p>
<p>For example, to see why we shouldn't update software, let's take a look at <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react">React</a>. To date, it has over 500 versions that have been released. No, not development snapshots (even though some experimental new versions are included), publically released versions that need to be installed, managed and coped with:</p>
<p><img alt="react versions" src="https://blog.kronis.dev/images/r/e/a/c/t/react-versions-1c6d1bd1.jpeg"></p>
<p>But once again, that's not the full story. Creating a simple React app with <code>create-react-app</code> makes us fetch an absolutely absurd amount of code, files and folders under <code>node_modules</code>:</p>
<p><img alt="node-modules" src="https://blog.kronis.dev/images/n/o/d/e/-/node-modules-4f8c2cd7.jpeg"></p>
<p>The idea of anyone ever understanding what's going on in there, or even auditing the security of all of it, is simply absurd! Don't believe me? Have a look at a dependency graph of this newly created "Hello world" project:</p>
<p><img alt="dependencies for a simple project" src="https://blog.kronis.dev/images/d/e/p/e/n/dependencies-for-a-simple-app-3da0fdaf.jpeg"></p>
<p>There are almost 1500 different modules in there! Many of those will have updates eventually. Many of those will also have breaking changes. You will run into problems with that. And even if you don't, the chances of something malicious getting in there, or for the development stack to get too large for you to be able to explore it is a question of time, rather one of probability. Once again, do not update!</p>
<h3>A more stable world without updates</h3>
<p>Let's look at some software that's the exact opposite. It's stable, doesn't have many breaking changes, and comes with "batteries included". No, i'm not talking about Angular, because even that's a mess in comparison, i'm talking about the <a href="https://www.lazarus-ide.org/">Lazarus IDE</a>, the modern and perhaps the only way to write Pascal code!</p>
<p><img alt="lazarus ide" src="https://blog.kronis.dev/images/l/a/z/a/r/lazarus-ide-e66e70cb.jpeg"></p>
<p>But it's not just a tool for writing code, instead, it does something a bit more amazing and peculiar. It also includes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazarus_Component_Library">Lazarus Component Library</a>, a large package of components and classes that concern not only GUI development (which, by the way, is abstracted away from the platforms entirely), but also offers lots of useful functionality that would otherwise need to be installed separately in almost any other tech stack out there:</p>
<p><img alt="lazarus component library" src="https://blog.kronis.dev/images/l/a/z/a/r/lazarus-component-library-ec79c91c.png"></p>
<p>Consider a scenario in which you want a MySQL driver for your app. In npm, you install it with bunches of dependencies. In Java, you pull it down with Maven or Gradle. In Python, you probably mess around with native extensions and have to install additional packages for your OS/container for it to even work. But with Lazarus, you drop it from the component palette into your application and are on your way. More platforms should be like that! Only support a known and trusted subset of software packages, keep them in tree and update them with the larger software package, in this case, the IDE.</p>
<p>Some of you might realize that what i'm describing is actually a lot like the <a href="https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/ports/">FreeBSD approach to packages</a> - a stable enclave of "good software", that's optionally built upon by "ports", external and less table packages which the user will have to install themselves while being aware that those aren't supported. This sort of discouragement is exactly what most of the developers behind npm should have experienced more of! Same for React, Angular and most other technologies out there!</p>
<p>What i'm saying is that most of the integrations, dependencies and other software should be kept "in-tree" for most tools and packages out there. To hell with dynamic linking, use stable and minimalistic packages where needed, much like Windows does instead of Linux. Not only that, but put anything and everything you will ever need within the standard library or one or two large additional libraries. When eventually people will want to do more, provide pushback and curb their enthusiasm, make them do less instead of more. Slow down their pace of development and therefore also updates, preferring stable and good software in 5 to 10 years, as opposed to a half baked SaaS trap in 2 years, which will stop being supported in 4. Yes, at this point i'm getting into why this probably won't be possible in our current society, but my thoughts on the subject are unchanged by this reality.</p>
<h3>It's already happening</h3>
<p>But that's not to say that large, breaking releases aren't already happening and that people aren't sticking with the more stable stuff. Just look at <a href="https://snyk.io/blog/developers-dont-want-to-leave-java-8-as-64-hold-firm-on-their-preferred-release/">JDK versions that are used</a> in the industry:</p>
<p><img alt="java versions" src="https://blog.kronis.dev/images/j/a/v/a/-/java-versions-dca7d97c.jpeg"></p>
<p>The majority of existing projects out there are stuck with JDK 8, either due to their dependencies, their requirements, the ecosystem surrounding them, people not knowing about the benefits of the newer versions or simply not caring, or maybe the whole migration process being so time consuming, complicated and expensive that most companies out there simply don't want to touch the idea of doing that with a 10 foot pole. Essentially, what i described above is happening, but for all of the wrong reasons!</p>
<p>That brings me to the next point - situations like that are unavoidable. Sooner or later, there will be a significant amount of projects out there that will be stuck on old versions. There will be plenty of .NET 2.0 projects out there that will be running on dated installations of Windows Server 2012, instead of running the latest cross platform .NET Core or nowadays just .NET 5+. There will be plenty of old Java projects out there, or old PHP 5 projects out there and so on.</p>
<p>And my argument is not that this should be the expected outcome, but rather that it's something inevitable. Therefore, we should prepare for the eventual mess of legacy software, with entire languages possibly dying out and there being <a href="https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/news/hr-news/pages/desperate-need-for-cobol-programmers-underlines-importance-of-workforce-planning.aspx">significant issues in finding developers for them</a>, once it's discovered that there's actually software that's mission critical running in some old forgotten server room. And the easier we'll make dealing with old code for ourselves, the easier our lives will be - the more focus we'll put on truly non-breaking security updates that keep your dated software alive and running well, the better our future will be.</p>
<p>To that end, it's actually imperative that we slow down our development and the speed of updates, which add new features.</p>
<h3>Forcing things to slow down</h3>
<p>It's important that code written 20 years in the future remain vaguely similar to what we have now, so that old codebases can be recognized. Think Java Streams API, over syntactic sugar that changes how the actual language works. Think more along the lines of a stable base, that's well documented, thoroughly tested and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFRKrHE8oPo&amp;t=518s">helps you use it with its discoverability</a>, instead of making you do some long forgotten Maven rituals that are like something out of Warhammer 40k, because noone bothered to write documentation in the pursuit of agility.</p>
<p>Bring back the old days where we engineered software to be used long term, instead of the current day world of: "Move fast and break things... oh, and don't bother thinking about what'll happen in 10 years, because your CV will be full of bleeding edge stuff, your bank account will be loaded and the troubles with most of the projects behind you won't be the slightest of your concerns." Realistically, you probably don't care about this stuff, but on the grand scale of things, perhaps you should.</p>
<p>I don't know about you, but i think that we shouldn't even need containers for reproducible environments in the first place. We should take a page out of the BSD operating system group book, instead of the GNU/Linux distros that are patched together out of bunches of different pieces of software of vastly varying quality. We shouldn't bend to the whims of the businesses which want things done yesterday. We should strive for the standards of engineering, where we are in control of the stacks that we work with and actually know what's going on inside of them.</p>
<p>Why do we need a new Java version every year and to only support the LTS ones for 5 years? Why do we need multiple Ubuntu releases per year and to only support the LTS ones for 5 years? Why not a new release every 5 years with everything else between being just patches and non breaking changes and a new major release every 20 years instead?</p>
<p>If things don't work out that way, then eventually we'll just have bunches of clueless code monkeys that execute npm commands that they don't understand to use frameworks and mechanisms which they have no hope of understanding to create as much value as quickly possible in the short period before all of that goes to hell and there's the eventual breakdown of nothing working and noone having any idea of why. I'm exaggerating slightly, but sooner or later software projects out there will exceed the cognitive capabilities of any single person - the only question is whether that will happen in 50 or 500 years.</p>
<h3>What to actually do now?</h3>
<p>Don't choose <a href="https://vimeo.com/156706113">Clusterpoint</a> for your project, which actually died in just a few years and now needs to be maintained in one of the legacy projects that i'm stuck in. Instead, pick <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> and use it for <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/">more than 20 years</a>. Realistically, you can't avoid updates entirely, but you can at least try to decrease the frequency of them that you'll run into and will have to deal with.</p>
<p>Use self contained packages and only use them for the things that they are good for - for example, Ruby on Rails for a simple webapp will be a better choice than stitching together 20 different libraries. Having the freedom of choice in the library case will cause more problems than its worth.</p>
<p>And lastly, <a href="http://boringtechnology.club/">choose boring technology</a>. Only use software that you're sure will be supported in 10 years. Only use software, which has very few "unknown unknowns". Only use software, where the development pace has slowed down to a reasonable degree, as opposed to React pulling a sneaky on everyone and introducing hooks, which was a pretty bad move, especially if you needed to migrate to them. </p>
<p>Use maintenance mode software:</p>
<ul>
<li>Debian over Fedora</li>
<li>Docker Swarm over Kubernetes</li>
<li>Java over Go</li>
<li>Angular over React</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, this only applies to projects that you're about to start. Chances are, that if you're working in the industry and will have to handle codebases written by others, then <a href="https://earthly.dev/blog/brown-green-language/">preferring brownfield technologies will make you less happy</a>, given that there will be more bad ones out there. Your mileage may vary and don't expect all of the answers here.</p>
<p>As for the actual updates: the above approaches should decrease the frequency at which they need to be done. That said, the title of the article is not entirely honest - do install security updates and do install updates to the LTS software that you're using, be it Ubuntu LTS, Unity LTS, Java 11, or anything else... Just be sure that you have backups that work before doing that!</p>
<h3>Update</h3>
<p>I've cleaned the text up a little bit and have decided to extract an idea about a versioning scheme out of the main body of text.</p>
<p>I believe that software could benefit from something more finely grained than semantic versioning. </p>
<p>Perhaps an alternate scheme, that goes more into detail about what's included in any given release:</p>
<ul>
<li>major new functionality changes</li>
<li>minor, backwards compatible'ish functionality additions</li>
<li>patch, bug fixes that could still break code that's written with them in mind</li>
<li>security, fixes that should not affect code bugs as long as those do not concern security exploits</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe it would be possible to have those patch versions be globally unique, so that you'd know that your software <code>V5.152.4567.7213</code> has had 5 major versions released so far, 152 feature releases across those major versions, 4567 bug fixes to date and 7213 security fixes? Thus, you could tie them to Jira ticket numbers or what have you, though it would probably break some ordering of these versions somewhere, so i'm not entirely sure about that. Granted, i can't actually tell whether adding that sort of complexity would actually be good for anyone, seeing as people seem to have trouble keeping themselves to the standards set forth by semantic versioning already. </p>
<h3>Update #2</h3>
<p>I've actually written <a href="https://blog.kronis.dev/articles/stable-software-release-system">a separate article about how software versioning could be done</a>, with a larger focus on stability and backwards compatibility. I still think that i'm quite there yet in regards to the quality of my writing, but it should serve as a conceptual alternative to semver, maybe it's worth a look at?</p>
<p>Someone actually posted this article on Hacker News, though sadly i missed it due to being busy with my work. Nonetheless, you can go to the thread and <a href="https://bit.ly/30i6Eep">read my comment</a>, which should provide a real world example of why breaking changes and large generational shifts can be a very time consuming thing.</p>
<p>To sum up everything above in a single sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In my eyes it could be pretty nice to have a framework version that's supported for 10-20 years and is so stable that it can be used with little to no changes for the entire expected lifetime of a system.</p>

  <p>Few months ago I was also writing a long tweet-reply to this <a href="https://x.com/srush_nlp/status/1779938508578165198" target="_blank">tweet</a> by <a href="https://x.com/srush_nlp" target="_blank">@srush_nlp</a> at some point. Then the tweet got deleted because I closed the tab by accident.¯\_(ツ)_/¯  I promised to write it as a blog post some day. <br></p><div><p>So here it is!</p><p>This will be the first part of a series of blog posts I plan to write about model architectures in the era of LLMs (I hope).&nbsp;</p></div><h4><strong>A quick primer  (Skip connection to next section if you feel confident)</strong></h4><p>There are mainly three overarching paradigms of model architectures in the past couple of years. Encoder-only models (<em>e.g., BERT</em>), Encoder-Decoder models (<em>e.g., T5</em>) and decoder-only models (e.g., <em>GPT series</em>). People get confused a lot about this and people often have tons of misconceptions about these dichotomies and architectures so I’m hoping this post will help.</p><p>The first thing to really understand is that encoder-decoder models are actually still autoregressive models. A decoder in an encoder-decoder model is literally and fundamentally still a causal decoder. Instead of pre-filling a decoder model, some text can be offloaded to an encoder, which is then sent to the decoder via cross-attention. Yes, T5 models are also language models!</p><p>A variant of this is a Prefix Language model or PrefixLM <strong>architecture</strong>, which does almost the same thing minus the cross attention (<em>and some other small details like sharing weights between encoder/decoder plus not having no encoder bottleneck</em>). PrefixLMs are also sometimes known as non-casual decoders. In short, encoder-decoders, decoder-only models and PrefixLMs are not that different altogether!</p><p>In the latest excellent lecture by Hyung Won, he masterfully gave explanations about the relationship between these models. You can check it out <a href="https://x.com/hwchung27/status/1800676312916656592" target="_blank">here</a>. Good stuff.</p><p>Meanwhile, encoder-only models such as the OG BERT does denoising differently (i.e., in-place) and to some extent, rely on classification “task” heads to do anything useful with the base model after pretraining. Denoising objective was later adopted in models like T5 in an “adapted style” using the sequence to sequence format.</p><p>To this end, it is worth noting that denoising in T5 is not exactly a new objective function per se (in the machine learning sense) but rather a data transformation across inputs, i.e., you can also train span corruption objective with a causal decoder too by the way!</p><p>People always assume encoder decoder models have to be denoising models partly because of the <em>overly representative</em> T5 model. However, <em>this is not always true.</em> You can train an encoder-decoder with a regular language modeling task (i.e.m, CLM). Conversely you can also train a causal decoder with the span corruption task. As I’ve said earlier, this is mostly a data transformation.</p><div><p>It is also worth to note that, generally speaking, an Encoder-Decoders of 2N parameters has the same compute cost as a decoder-only model of N parameters which gives it a different FLOP to parameter count ratio. This is just like “model sparsity” that is split across inputs and targets.</p><p>This is nothing new, and I didn’t come up with anything new here. It’s already in the 2019 T5 paper and reemphasized in the UL2 paper.&nbsp;</p></div><p>For now, glad to get this out of the way. Now onto objectives.</p><h4>On the denoising objective (does it not work? does it not scale? is it too easy?)</h4><p>The denoising objective I’m referring to is any variation of the “span corruption” task. This is sometimes known as “infilling” or “fill in the blank”. There are variations on how to express it (i.e., span length, randomness, sentinel tokens etc). But you get the gist.&nbsp;</p><p>While the denoising objective in BERT style models are mostly “in-place”, (e.g., classification head on top of mask tokens), the slightly more modern way is to do it “T5-style”, <em>ala</em> data transformation that can be processed by an encoder-decoder or decoder-only model. In such a data transformation, masked tokens are just “moved to the back” for the model for prediction.</p><p>The primary goal of pretraining is to build a useful internal representation that can be aligned for downstream tasks in the most efficient and effective way possible. The better the internal representations, the easier to use these learned representations for anything useful later. The simple next word prediction&nbsp; “causal language modeling” objective is known to do this very well and has served as the bread and butter of the LLM revolution. The question now at hand is whether the denoising objective is just as good.</p><p>From publicly available information, we know that T5-11B works pretty well even after being aligned/SFT-ed (Flan-T5 XXL’s MMLU score is 55+, which is more than decent for a model of this scale and of that time). Hence, we can make some conclusion that the transfer process (pretraining -&gt; alignment) of the denoising objective works relatively reasonably well at this scale.</p><p>My take is that denoising objectives are great but pretty insufficient as a standalone objective. A big drawback is because of a reason which we could call less “loss exposure”. In denoising objectives, only a small amount of tokens are being masked and gets learned as a result (i.e., taken into account in the loss). Conversely, in regular language modeling, this is close to 100%. This makes for pretty low sample efficiency per FLOP which makes denoising objectives hugely disadvantaged on a flop-basis comparison.&nbsp;</p><p>Another drawback is that denoising objectives are more unnatural than regular language modeling since it reformats the input/output in a strange way, making them a little awkward for few-shot learning. (It’s still possible to massage these models to do reasonably okay on few-shot tasks though). Hence, I believe denoising objectives should pretty much only be used as a complementary objective to regular language modeling.</p><h4>The early days of unification and why xBERTs went extinct</h4><p>The gradual phasing out of BERT-like models was an interesting phase that not many people talk about these days. It was subtle. This could also explain why we don’t see any mega large scale BERT models running around anymore. The reason? It was largely a matter of unification and shift in task/modeling paradigms. BERT-style models are cumbersome, but the real deprecation of BERT models was because people wanted to do all tasks at once, which led to a better way of doing denoising - using autoregressive models.</p><p>During 2018-2021, there was an implicit paradigm shift of single task finetuning to massively multi-task models. This slowly gravitated us towards the unified “SFT” models that we see today that are universal and general purpose. It was simply so hard to do this with BERT. I don’t think this has anything much to do with “denoising” at all. People simply found a way to re-express denoising pretraining tasks if they wanted to use such a model (i.e., T5) which made BERT-style models pretty much deprecated at this point because there is a strictly better alternative.</p><p>To be even more concrete, encoder-decoder and decoder-only models were able to express multiple tasks at once without the need for task specific classification heads. For Encoder-Decoders, if the decoder was getting in the way, researchers and engineers also began to find out that yanking out the encoder performed just as competitive as a BERT encoder. Moreover, it also retains the same bidirectional attention benefit that made BERT competitive over GPT models at small (often production) scale.&nbsp;</p><h4>The value of denoising objectives</h4><p>Denoising pretraining objective also learns to predict the next word in a similar way to regular language modeling. However, different from regular causal language modeling, a data transformation is applied to the sequence such that the model learns to “fill in the blanks” instead of simply predicting the naturally occuring left-to-right text.&nbsp;</p><p>Notably, denoising objectives are sometimes also called “infilling tasks” that are sometimes mashed together into pretraining together with regular language modeling tasks.</p><div><p>While the exact configuration and implementation details can vary, modern LLMs today may use a combination of language modeling and infilling in some capacity. It is actually interesting how this mixture of LM + infilling seemed to have been propagated around the same time (e.g., <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05131"><span>UL2</span></a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.14255"><span>FIM</span></a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02414"><span>GLM</span></a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07520"><span>CM3</span></a>), with many groups bringing their own flavor of this mixture in some way. On a side note, the largest publicly disclosed &amp; reported model trained in this style is likely the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10403"><span>PaLM-2 model</span></a>.</p><p>It is also worth noting that pretraining task mixtures could be also stacked sequentially and does not necessarily have to be mixed concurrently, i.e., Flan-T5 originally trains on 1T span corruption tokens and switches out to 100B tokens of prefix language modeling objective before flan instruction tuning. To some extent, this qualifies as a mixed denoised/LM objective model. To be clear, prefix language modeling objective (not to be confused with architecture) is simply casual language modeling with a split point randomly determined and sent to the input side (with no loss and non-casual masking). </p><p>On a side’s note, infilling could have originated from the world of code LLMs, where filling in the blank was more of a feature desired by coding applications. Meanwhile, UL2 was motivated more by unifying the class of tasks that denoising objectives and bidirectional LLMs do well on with inherently generative tasks (such as summarization or open-ended generation). An advantage of this autoregressive style of denoising “shift to the back” is that it allows the model to not only learn longer range dependencies but also implicitly benefit from <em>non-explicit</em> bidirectional attention (since you would already have seen the future in order to fill in the blank).</p><p>Anecdotal experience is that denoising objectives learn representations that are better at certain classes of tasks, sometimes in a more sample efficient way. In the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11399"><span>U-PaLM</span></a> paper, we showed how a small amount of span corruption up-training changes behavior and emergence on a set of BIG-Bench tasks. On top of that, finetuning models trained with this objective generally result in better supervised fine-tuning models, especially at smaller scale.</p><p>When it comes to single-task finetuning, you can see the OG <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02311" target="_blank">PaLM-1</a> 62B model gets defeated by a much smaller T5 model. Bidirectional attention + denoising objective packs a punch at a relatively small scale! I’m sure many practitioners see this happen these days as well, especially in production.</p></div><h4>What about bidirectional attention?</h4><div><p>Bidirectional attention is an interesting “inductive bias” for language models - one that is commonly conflated with objectives and model backbones. The usefulness of inductive biases changes at different compute regions and could have different effects on scaling curves at different compute regions. That said, it could be true that bidirectional doesn’t seem to matter that much at larger scales compared to smaller scales, or have different impacts on different tasks or modalities. For instance, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07726v1" target="_blank">PaliGemma</a> makes use of PrefixLM architectures.</p><p>As Hyung won also points out in his <a href="https://x.com/hwchung27/status/1800676312916656592" target="_blank">lecture</a>, PrefixLM models (decoder-only models with bidirectional attention) also have an issue with caching and are an intrinsic drawback with this type of architecture. However, I think there are many ways to work around this flaw which is out of scope for this post.</p></div><h4>Pros and Cons of Encoder-Decoder architectures</h4><div><p>Encoder-decoder architectures actually have some pros vs regular decoder-only models. The first case is where the encoder side is not restricted by a causal mask. To some extent, you can go crazy with the attention layers by doing aggressive pooling or any form of linear attention without worrying about the autoregressive design restriction. This is a good way to offload not so important “context” to an encoder. You can also make the encoder smaller, which is neat. </p><p>One example of how encoder-decoder architecture was necessary was in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12672" target="_blank">Charformer</a>, where we could go crazy on the encoder and mitigate the speed drawbacks of byte-level models. Encoder-side innovations allow quick wins without worrying about major resigns of the causal mask.&nbsp;</p></div><p>Meanwhile, one negative point of the encoder-decoder versus PrefixLM is that inputs and targets have to have fixed allocated budgets. For instance, if the input budget is 1024 tokens, the encoder side has to be padded to this value which causes a lot of potential for wasted compute. Conversely, in PrefixLM, input and targets can just be directly concatenated which mitigates this problem.</p><h4>Relevance to models today and key takeaways</h4><p>The ability to reason with inductive biases both at architectural and from a pre-training perspective is a critical aspect of being a competent LLM researcher and practitioner today. Understanding the fundamental nuances helps one to extrapolate and continue to innovate.</p><p>Here are my key takeaways:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Encoder-decoder and decoder-only models are both autoregressive models that have implementation-level differences and pros/cons. They are subtly different inductive biases. Optimal usage really depends on downstream use-case and pretty much application constraints. Meanwhile, for most LLM usage and niche use-cases aside, BERT style encoder models are mostly considered deprecated.</p></li><li><p>Denoising objectives are mostly complementary to CLM. They have just found their way as “supporting objectives” in pretraining. Training CLM with denoising objectives usually helps in some way. While this happens very frequently in code models (i.e., code infilling), it is not uncommon (though not mandatory) for general purpose models today still pretrain with CLM with some denoising objective.</p></li><li><p>Bidirectional attention helps a lot at smaller scales but is generally optional at larger scales. This is mostly anecdotal. I see bidirectional attention has a form of inductive bias, just like many other types of modifications to Transformer models.</p></li></ol><p>Finally, on to recap, we don’t see any scaled up xBERTs running around: BERT models got deprecated in favor of more flexible forms of denoising (autoregressive) T5 models. This is largely due to paradigm unification where people would like to perform any task with a general purpose model (as opposed to task specific model). Meanwhile, autoregressive denoising gets sometimes folded as side objectives to casual language models.&nbsp;</p><h4>Final words &amp; Acknowledgements</h4><div><p>It’s really fun to write about model architecture. I hope to write more about LLMs and AI research in general. </p><p>I thank Hyung Won Chung and Vinh Tran for feedback on this post.</p></div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Thesis</strong>: Crowdstrike is not worth 93 billion dollars (at time of writing).</p>

<p><strong>Fear</strong>: CrowdStrike is an enterprise-grade employee spying app masquerading as a cloud application observability dashboard.</p>

<p><strong>OBSERVATIONS</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The 75th percentile retail investor has a tenuous grasp on “Cloud”, “Software Engineering”, and “Cyber Security”.</li>
<li>The median “Cyber Security Analyst” has a tenuous grasp on “Cyber Security”</li>
<li>The median “Software Engineer” has a tenuous grasp on “Cyber Security” and “Cloud”</li>
<li>The median retail investor has a tenuous grasp on “markets” and “liquidity pools”</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>CRITIQUES</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Corporations could buy CrowdStrike to spy on their own employees.</p></li>
<li><p>CrowdStrike’s utility is limited- they simply collect all of their customer’s data and display it on a dashboard. </p></li>
<li><p>CrowdStrike is dangerous in that they have root access to every device(i.e. endpoint) across thousands of firms.</p></li>
<li><p>CrowdStrike customers sign up to get their firm’s data added to a bank which CrowdStrike then has license to use for “correlation”</p></li>
<li><p>CrowdStrike is a sitting-duck datamine for the FBI/NSA to subpoena. </p></li>
<li><p>CrowdStrike could potentially behave as a propaganda arm of the US government by creating “fake hacking stories” which are un-disprovable.They are able to do this due to information asymmetries in society.</p></li>
<li><p>Properly built “cloud applications” have security baked in by virtue of separation of concerns in the "software supply chain". (e.g. containerization engine developer is different than the OS developer is different than the Cloud Infrastructure Provider). </p></li>
<li><p>CrowdStrike’s Falcon product contradicts their own guiding principle of “Zero-Trust Security”.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>COMMENTARY</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>CrowdStrike’s product includes a “client” which runs on every "customer endpoint” (i.e. company issued laptop). Activity on the company issued laptop is reported to an internal dashboard which only an IT guy + a C-Suite admin have access to. They ALSO offer observability into each component of a business’s own “cloud application”.</li>
<li>These are 100% different lines of business which can be easily conflated.</li>
<li>CrowdStrike admits that they collect all of a business’ “endpoint data'' and they compare it to other data they have to "draw insights"; this means that every company that hires CrowdStrike is part of a DATA COMMUNE.</li>
<li>It’s prohibitively hard to hack into a “cloud system” due to few possible entry points</li>
<li>Exfiltrating data at scale is difficult; employees of the company pose a bigger threat than "threat-actors".</li>
<li><em>Containerize Everything</em> + <em>Microservices Architecture</em> hampers "lateral movement". </li>
<li>Is CrowdStrike compatible with companies that run their IT systems on premises?</li>
</ul>

<p><em>The CrowdStrike Story So Far…</em></p>

<p><strong>2020</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>“Uses cloud technology to detect and thwart attempted cybersecurity breaches”</p></li>
<li><p>“Runs on your endpoint or server or workload”</p></li>
<li><p>“Signature based technologies don’t go far enough”</p></li>
<li><p>“We collect trillions of events” </p></li>
<li><p>“There hasn’t been a salesforce of security” </p></li>
</ul>

<p>—  FAST FORWARD — </p>

<p><strong>2024</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Palo Alto Networks(100% different business line) is being pitted against CrowdStrike in the media. </li>
<li>Crowdstrike allegedly offers a poorly differentiated suite of generically titled products: <strong>(Falcon Discover, Falcon Spotlight, Falcon Prevent, Falcon Horizon, Falcon Insight(EDR), Falcon Insight(XDR), Falcon Overwatch, Falcon Complete(MDR), Falcon Cloud Security)</strong>. There is no way to confirm unless you schedule a meeting with their team though.</li>
<li>I spoke to a “Network Engineer” at CrowdStrike. He said that he “mostly tries to get bug bounties”. </li>
<li>“CrowdStrike сustomers: 44 of 100 Fortune 100 companies, 37 of 100 top global companies, 9 of 20 major banks &amp; 7 of the TOP 10 largest energy institutions.”  This makes it a threat vector.</li>
</ul>

<p>Misleading videos on their site: </p>

<p>Airlines, payment processors, 911 call centers, TV networks, and other businesses have been scrambling this morning after a buggy update to CrowdStrike's Falcon security software caused Windows-based systems to crash with a dreaded blue screen of death (BSOD) error message.</p>
<p>We're updating <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/major-outages-at-crowdstrike-microsoft-leave-the-world-with-bsods-and-confusion/">our story about the outage</a> with new details as we have them. Microsoft and CrowdStrike <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/statement-on-falcon-content-update-for-windows-hosts/">both say</a> that "the affected update has been pulled," so what's most important for IT admins in the short term is getting their systems back up and running again. According to guidance from Microsoft, fixes range from annoying but easy to incredibly time-consuming and complex, depending on the number of systems you have to fix and the way your systems are configured.</p>
<p>Microsoft's Azure status page outlines several fixes. The first and easiest is simply to try to reboot affected machines over and over, which gives affected machines multiple chances to try to grab CrowdStrike's non-broken update before the bad driver can cause the BSOD. Microsoft <a href="https://azure.status.microsoft/en-us/status">says</a> that some of its customers have had to reboot their systems as many as 15 times to pull down the update.</p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-19-at-11.01.45%E2%80%AFAM.png" data-height="670" data-width="1444" alt="Early guidance for fixing the CrowdStrike bug is simply to reboot systems over and over again so that they can try to grab a non-broken update."><img alt="Early guidance for fixing the CrowdStrike bug is simply to reboot systems over and over again so that they can try to grab a non-broken update." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-19-at-11.01.45%E2%80%AFAM-980x455.png" width="980" height="455"></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-19-at-11.01.45%E2%80%AFAM.png" data-height="670" data-width="1444">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> Early guidance for fixing the CrowdStrike bug is simply to reboot systems over and over again so that they can try to grab a non-broken update.</p><p>Microsoft</p></figcaption></figure>
<h2>If rebooting doesn’t work</h2>
<p>If rebooting multiple times isn't fixing your problem, Microsoft recommends restoring your systems using a backup from before 4:09 UTC on July 18 (just after midnight on Friday, Eastern time), when CrowdStrike began pushing out the buggy update. Crowdstrike says a reverted version of the file was deployed at 5:27 UTC.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>If these simpler fixes don't work, you may need to boot your machines into Safe Mode so you can manually delete the file that's causing the BSOD errors. For virtual machines, Microsoft recommends <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/virtual-machines/windows/troubleshoot-recovery-disks-portal-windows">attaching the virtual disk to a known-working repair VM</a> so the file can be deleted, then reattaching the virtual disk to its original VM.</p>
<p>The file in question is a CrowdStrike driver located at <code>Windows/System32/Drivers/CrowdStrike/C<strong>-</strong>00000291*.sys</code>. Once it's gone, the machine should boot normally and grab a non-broken version of the driver.</p>
<p>Deleting that file on each and every one of your affected systems individually is time-consuming enough, but it's even&nbsp;<em>more</em> time-consuming for customers using Microsoft's BitLocker drive encryption to protect data at rest. Before you can delete the file on those systems, you'll need the recovery key that unlocks those encrypted disks and makes them readable (normally, this process is invisible, because the system can just read the key stored in a physical or virtual TPM module).</p>
<p>This can cause problems for admins who aren't using key management to store their recovery keys, since (by design!) you can't access a drive without its recovery key. If you don't have that key, Cryptography and infrastructure engineer Tony Arcieri on Mastodon <a href="https://mas.to/@bascule/112813348028513131">compared this</a> to a "self-inflicted ransomware attack," where an attacker encrypts the disks on your systems and withholds the key until they get paid.</p>
<p>And even if you do have a recovery key, your key management server <a href="https://mas.to/@pinkforest@hachyderm.io/112813354182343410">might also be affected by the CrowdStrike bug</a>.</p>
<p>We'll continue to track recommendations from <a href="https://azure.status.microsoft/en-us/status">Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/statement-on-falcon-content-update-for-windows-hosts/">CrowdStrike</a> about fixes as each company's respective status pages are updated.</p>
<p>"We understand the gravity of the situation and are deeply sorry for the inconvenience and disruption," <a href="https://x.com/George_Kurtz/status/1814316045185822981">wrote</a> CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz on X, formerly Twitter. "We are working with all impacted customers to ensure that systems are back up and they can deliver the services their customers are counting on."</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main">
    

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>

<p>I’m a big fan of <a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus</a> and
<a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana</a>. As a former SRE at Google I’ve learned to
appreciate good monitoring, and this combination has been a winner for me
over the past year. I’m using them for monitoring my personal servers (both
black-box and white-box monitoring), for the
<a href="https://encounter.eus/">Euskal Encounter</a> external and internal event infra,
for work I do professionally for clients, and more. Prometheus makes it very
easy to write custom exporters to monitor your own data, and there’s a good
chance you’ll find an exporter that already works for you out of the box.
For example, we use <a href="https://github.com/justwatchcom/sql_exporter">sql_exporter</a>
to make a pretty dashboard of attendee metrics for the Encounter events.</p>

    <figcaption>
        <h4>Event dashboard for Euskal Encounter (fake staging data)</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>Since it’s so easy to throw
<a href="https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter"><code>node_exporter</code></a> onto any random
machine and have a Prometheus instance scrape it for basic system-level metrics
(CPU, memory, network, disk, filesystem usage, etc), I figured, why not also
monitor my laptop? I have a Clevo “gaming” laptop that serves as my primary
workstation, mostly pretending to be a desktop at home but also traveling with
me to big events like the Chaos Communication Congress. Since I already have a
VPN between it and one of my servers where I run Prometheus, I can just
<code>emerge prometheus-node_exporter</code>, bring up the service, and point my Prometheus
instance at it. This automatically configures alerts for it, which means my
phone will make a loud noise whenever I open way too many Chrome tabs and run
out of my 32GB of RAM. Perfect.</p>

<h2 id="trouble-on-the-horizon">Trouble on the horizon</h2>

<p>Barely an hour after setting this up, though, my phone did get a page: my
newly-added target was inaccessible. Alas, I could SSH into the laptop fine, so
it was definitely up, but <code>node_exporter</code> had crashed.</p>

<p><code>node_exporter</code>, like many Prometheus components, is written in Go. Go is a
relatively safe language: while it allows you to shoot yourself in the foot if
you so wish, and it doesn’t have nearly as strong safety guarantees as, say,
Rust does, it is still not too easy to accidentally cause a segfault in Go.
More so, <code>node_exporter</code> is a relatively simple Go app with mostly pure-Go
dependencies. Therefore, this was an interesting crash to get. Especially since
the crash was inside <code>mallocgc</code>, which should never crash under normal
circumstances.</p>

<p>Things got more interesting after I restarted it a few times:</p>

<p>And now the garbage collector stumbled upon a problem. Yet a different crash.</p>

<p>At this point, there are two natural conclusions: either I have a severe
hardware issue, or there is a wild memory corruption bug in the binary. I
initially considered the former unlikely, as this machine has a very heavily
mixed workload and no signs of instability that can be traced back to hardware
(I have my fair share of crashing software, but it’s never <em>random</em>). Since Go
binaries like <code>node_exporter</code> are statically linked and do not depend on any other
libraries, I can download the official release binary and try that, which would
eliminate most of the rest of my system as a variable. Yet, when I did so, I
still got a crash.</p>

<p>Yet another completely different crash. At this point there was a decent chance
that there was truly an upstream problem with <code>node_exporter</code> or one of its
dependencies, so I filed an
<a href="https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/issues/730">issue</a> on GitHub.
Perhaps the developers had seen this before? It’s worth bringing this kind of
issue to their attention and seeing if they have any ideas.</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, upstream’s first guess was that it was a hardware issue. This
isn’t unreasonable: after all, I’m only hitting the problem on one specific
machine. All my other machines are happily running <code>node_exporter</code>. While I had no
other evidence of hardware-linked instability on this host, I also had no other
explanation as to what was so particular about this machine that would make
<code>node_exporter</code> crash. A <a href="http://www.memtest.org/">Memtest86+</a> run never hurt
anyone, so I gave it a go.</p>

<p>And then this happened:</p>

<p>Whoops! Bad RAM. Well, to be more specific, <em>one bit</em> of bad RAM. After letting
the test run for a full pass, all I got was that single bad bit, plus a few
false positives in test 7 (which moves blocks around and so can amplify a single
error).</p>

<p>Further testing showed that Memtest86+ test #5 in SMP mode would quickly detect
the error, but usually not on the first pass. The error was always the same bit
at the same address. This suggests that the problem is a weak or leaky RAM cell.
In particular, one which gets worse with temperature. This is quite logical:
a higher temperature increases leakage in the RAM cells and thus makes it more
likely that a somewhat marginal cell will actually cause a bit flip.</p>

<p>To put this into perspective, this is one bad bit out of 274,877,906,944. That’s
actually a very good error rate! Hard disks and Flash memory have much higher
error rates - it’s just that those devices have bad blocks marked at the factory
that are transparently swapped out without the user knowing, and can
transparently mark newly discovered weak blocks as bad and relocate them to a
spare area. RAM has no such luxury, so a bad bit sticks forever.</p>

<p>Alas, this is vanishingly unlikely to be the cause of my <code>node_exporter</code> woes.
That app uses very little RAM, and so the chances of it hitting the bad bit
(repeatedly, at that) are extremely low. This kind of problem would be largely
unnoticeable, perhaps causing a pixel error in some graphics, a single letter
to flip in some text, an instruction to be corrupted that probably won’t ever
be run, and perhaps the rare segfault when something actually important does
land on the bad bit. Nonetheless, it does cause long-term reliability issues,
and this is why servers and other devices intended to be reliable must use ECC
RAM, which can correct this kind of error.</p>

<p>I don’t have the luxury of ECC RAM on this laptop. What I do have, though, is
the ability to mark the bad block of RAM as bad and tell the OS not to use it.
There is a little-known
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub/html_node/badram.html">feature</a>
of GRUB 2 which allows you to do just that, by changing the memory map that is
passed to the booted kernel. It’s not worth buying new RAM just for a single bad
bit (especially since DDR3 is already obsolete, and there’s a good chance new
RAM would have weak cells anyway), so this is a good option.</p>

<p>However, there’s one more thing I can do. Since the problem gets worse with
temperature, what happens if I heat up the RAM?</p>

<p>Using a heat gun set at a fairly low temperature (130°C) I warmed up two modules
at a time (the other two modules are under the rear cover, as my laptop has four
SODIMM slots total). Playing around with module order, I found three additional
weak bits only detectable at elevated temperature, and they were spread around
three of my RAM sticks.</p>

<p>I also found that the location of the errors stayed roughly consistent even as I
swapped modules around: the top bits of the address remained the same. This is
because the RAM is interleaved: data is spread over all four sticks, instead of
each stick being assigned a contiguous quarter of the available address space.
This is convenient, because I can just mask a region of RAM large enough to
cover all possible addresses for each error bit, and not have to worry that I
might swap sticks in the future and mess up the masking. I found that masking a
contiguous 128KiB area should cover all possible permutations of addresses for
each given bad bit, but, for good measure, I rounded up to 1MiB. This gave me
three 1MiB aligned blocks to mask out (one of them covers two of the bad bits,
for a total of four bad bits I wanted masked):</p>

<ul>
<li><code>0x36a700000</code> – <code>0x36a7fffff</code></li>
<li><code>0x460e00000</code> – <code>0x460efffff</code></li>
<li><code>0x4ea000000</code> – <code>0x4ea0fffff</code></li>
</ul>

<p>This can be specified using the address/mask syntax required by GRUB as follows,
in <code>/etc/default/grub</code>:</p>

<pre><code>GRUB_BADRAM="0x36a700000,0xfffffffffff00000,0x460e00000,0xfffffffffff00000,0x4ea000000,0xfffffffffff00000"
</code></pre>

<p>One quick <code>grub-mkconfig</code> later, I am down 3MiB of RAM and four dodgy bits with
it. It’s not ECC RAM, but this should increase the effective reliability of my
consumer-grade RAM, since now I know the rest of the memory is fine up to at
least 100°C.</p>

<p>Needless to say, <code>node_exporter</code> still crashed, but we knew this wasn’t the real
problem, didn’t we.</p>

<h2 id="digging-deeper">Digging deeper</h2>

<p>The annoying thing about this kind of bug is that it clearly is caused by some
kind of memory corruption that breaks code that runs later. This makes it very
hard to debug, because we can’t predict what will be corrupted (it varies), and
we can’t catch the bad code in the act of doing so.</p>

<p>First I tried some basic bisecting of available <code>node_exporter</code> releases and
enabling/disabling different collectors, but that went nowhere. I also tried
running an instance under <code>strace</code>. This seemed to stop the crashes, which
strongly points to a race-condition kind of problem. <code>strace</code> will usually wind
up serializing execution of apps to some extent, by intercepting all system
calls run by all threads. I would later find that the <code>strace</code> instance crashed
too, but it took much longer to do so. Since this seemed to be related to
concurrency, I tried setting <code>GOMAXPROCS=1</code>, which tells Go to only use a single
OS-level thread to run Go code. This also stopped the crashes, again pointing
strongly to a concurrency issue.</p>

<p>By now I had gathered quite a considerable number of crash logs, and I was
starting to notice some patterns. While there was a lot of variation in the
parts that were crashing and how, ultimately the error messages could be
categorized into different types and the same kind of error showed up more than
once. So I started Googling these errors, and this is how I stumbled upon
<a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/20427">Go issue #20427</a>. This was an issue
in seemingly an unrelated part of Go, but one that had caused similar segfaults
and random issues. The issue was closed with no diagnosis after it couldn’t be
reproduced with Go 1.9. Nobody knew what the root cause was, just that it had
stopped happening.</p>

<p>So I grabbed
<a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/20427#issuecomment-306346724">this</a> sample
code from the issue, which claimed to reproduce the problem, and ran it on my
machine. Lo and behold, it crashed within seconds. Bingo. This is a lot better
than waiting hours for <code>node_exporter</code> to crash.</p>

<p>That doesn’t get me any closer to debugging the issue from the Go side, but it
gives me a much faster way to test for it. So let’s try another angle.</p>

<h2 id="bisecting-machines">Bisecting machines</h2>

<p>I know the problem happens on my laptop, but doesn’t happen on any other of my
machines. I tried the reproducer on every other machine I have easy access to,
and couldn’t get it to crash on any of them. This tells me there’s something
special about my laptop. Since Go statically links binaries, the rest of
userspace doesn’t matter. This leaves two relevant parts: the hardware, and the
kernel.</p>

<p>I don’t have any easy way to test with various hardware other than the machines
I own, but I can play with kernels. So let’s try that. First order of business:
will it crash in a VM?</p>

<p>To test for this, I built a minimal initramfs that will allow me to very quickly
launch the reproducer in a QEMU VM without having to actually install a distro
or boot a full Linux system. My initramfs was built with Linux’s
<code>scripts/gen_initramfs_list.sh</code> and contained the following files:</p>

<pre><code>dir /dev 755 0 0
nod /dev/console 0600 0 0 c 5 1
nod /dev/null 0666 0 0 c 1 3
dir /bin 755 0 0
file /bin/busybox busybox 755 0 0
slink /bin/sh busybox 755 0 0
slink /bin/true busybox 755 0 0
file /init init.sh 755 0 0
file /reproducer reproducer 755 0 0
</code></pre>

<p><code>/init</code> is the entry point of a Linux initramfs, and in my case was a simple
shellscript to start the test and measure time:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
export PATH=/bin

start=$(busybox date +%s)

echo "Starting test now..."
/reproducer
ret=$?
end=$(busybox date +%s)
echo "Test exited with status $ret after $((end-start)) seconds"
</code></pre>

<p><code>/bin/busybox</code> is a statically linked version of BusyBox, often used in minimal
systems like this to provide all basic Linux shell utilities (including a shell
itself).</p>

<p>The initramfs can be built like this (from a Linux kernel source tree), where
list.txt is the file list above:</p>

<pre><code>scripts/gen_initramfs_list.sh -o initramfs.gz list.txt
</code></pre>

<p>And QEMU can boot the kernel and initramfs directly:</p>

<pre><code>qemu-system-x86_64 -kernel /boot/vmlinuz-4.13.9-gentoo -initrd initramfs.gz -append 'console=ttyS0' -smp 8 -nographic -serial mon:stdio -cpu host -enable-kvm
</code></pre>

<p>This resulted in no output at all to the console… and then I realized I hadn’t
even compiled 8250 serial port support into my laptop’s kernel. D’oh. I mean, it
doesn’t have a physical serial port, right? Anyway, a quick detour to rebuild
the kernel with serial support (and crossing my fingers that didn’t change
anything important), I tried again and it successfully booted and ran the
reproducer.</p>

<p>Did it crash? Yup. Good, this means the problem is reproducible on a VM on the
same machine. I tried the same QEMU command on my home server, with its own
kernel, and… nothing. Then I copied the kernel from my laptop and booted that
and… it crashed. The kernel is what matters. It’s not a hardware issue.</p>

<h2 id="juggling-kernels">Juggling kernels</h2>

<p>At this point, I knew I was going to be compiling lots of kernels to try to
narrow this down. So I decided to move to the most powerful machine I had lying
around: a somewhat old 12-core, 24-thread Xeon (now defunct, sadly). I copied
the known-bad kernel source to that machine, built it, and tested it.</p>

<p>It didn’t crash.</p>

<p>What?</p>

<p>Some head-scratching later, I made sure the original bad kernel binary crashed
(it did). Are we back to hardware? Does it matter which machine I <em>build</em> the
kernel on? So I tried building the kernel on my home server, and that one
promptly triggered the crash. Building the same kernel on two machines yields
crashes, a third machine doesn’t. What’s the difference?</p>

<p>Well, these are all Gentoo boxes, and all Gentoo Hardened at that. But my laptop
and my home server are both <code>~amd64</code> (unstable), while my Xeon server is <code>amd64</code>
(stable). That means GCC is different. My laptop and home server were both on
<code>gcc (Gentoo Hardened 6.4.0 p1.0) 6.4.0</code>, while my Xeon was on
<code>gcc (Gentoo Hardened 5.4.0-r3 p1.3, pie-0.6.5) 5.4.0</code>.</p>

<p>But my home server’s kernel, which was nearly the same version as my laptop
(though not exactly), built with the same GCC, did not reproduce the crashes. So
now we have to conclude that <em>both</em> the compiler used to build the kernel <em>and</em>
the kernel itself (or its config?) matter.</p>

<p>To narrow things down further, I compiled the exact kernel tree from my laptop
on my home server (linux-4.13.9-gentoo), and confirmed that it indeed crashed.
Then I copied over the <code>.config</code> from my home server and compiled that, and
found that it didn’t. This means we’re looking at a kernel config difference
<em>and</em> a compiler difference:</p>

<ul>
<li>linux-4.13.9-gentoo + gcc 5.4.0-r3 p1.3 + laptop .config - no crash</li>
<li>linux-4.13.9-gentoo + gcc 6.4.0 p1.0 + laptop .config - <em>crash</em></li>
<li>linux-4.13.9-gentoo + gcc 6.4.0 p1.0 + server .config - no crash</li>
</ul>

<p>Two <code>.config</code>s, one good, and one bad. Time to diff them. Of course, the two
configs were vastly different (since I tend to tailor my kernel config to only
include the drivers I need on any particular machine), so I had to repeatedly
rebuild the kernel while narrowing down the differences.</p>

<p>I decided to start with the “known bad” <code>.config</code> and start removing things.
Since the reproducer takes a variable amount of time to crash, it’s easier to
test for “still crashes” (just wait for it to crash) than for “doesn’t crash”
(how long do I have to wait to convince myself that it doesn’t?). Over the
course of 22 kernel builds, I managed to simplify the
<a href="https://marcan.st/posts/go_debug/config">config</a> so much that the kernel had no networking
support, no filesystems, no block device core, and didn’t even support PCI
(still works fine on a VM though!). My kernel builds now took less than 60
seconds and the kernel was about 1/4th the size of my regular one.</p>

<p>Then I moved on to the “known good” <code>.config</code> and removed all the unnecessary
junk while making sure it still didn’t crash the reproducer (which was trickier
and slower than the previous test). I had a few false branches, where I changed
something that made the reproducer start crashing (but I didn’t know what), yet
I misidentified them as “no crash”, so when I got a crash I had to walk back up
the previous kernels I’d built and make sure I knew exactly where the crash was
introduced. I ended up doing 7 kernel builds.</p>

<p>Eventually, I narrowed it down to a small handful of different .config options.
A few of them stood out, in particular <code>CONFIG_OPTIMIZE_INLINING</code>. After
carefully testing them I concluded that, indeed, that option was the culprit.
Turning it <em>off</em> produced kernels that crash the reproducer testcase, while
turning it <em>on</em> produced kernels that didn’t. This option, when turned on,
allows GCC to better determine which <code>inline</code> functions really must be inlined,
instead of forcing it to inline them unconditionally. This also explains the GCC
connection: inlining behavior is likely to change between GCC versions.</p>

<pre><code>/*

<p>So what next? We know that <code>CONFIG_OPTIMIZE_INLINING</code> makes the difference, but
that potentially changes the behavior of every single <code>inline</code> function across
the whole kernel. How to pinpoint the problem?</p>

<p>I had an idea.</p>

<h2 id="hash-based-differential-compilation">Hash-based differential compilation</h2>

<p>The basic premise is to compile <em>part</em> of the kernel with the option turned on,
and <em>part</em> of the kernel with the option turned off. By testing the resulting
kernel and checking whether the problem appears or not, we can deduce which
subset of the kernel compilation units contains the problem code.</p>

<p>Instead of trying to enumerate all object files and doing some kind of binary
search, I decided to go with a hash-based approach. I wrote this wrapper
script for GCC:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
args=("$@")

doit=
while [ $# -gt 0 ]; do
        case "$1" in
                -c)
                        doit=1
                        ;;
                -o)
                        shift
                        objfile="$1"
                        ;;
        esac
        shift
done

extra=
if [ ! -z "$doit" ]; then
        sha="$(echo -n "$objfile" | sha1sum - | cut -d" " -f1)"
        echo "${sha:0:8} $objfile" &gt;&gt; objs.txt
        if [ $((0x${sha:0:8} &amp; (0x80000000 &gt;&gt; $BIT))) = 0 ]; then
                echo "[n]" "$objfile" 1&gt;&amp;2
        else
                extra=-DCONFIG_OPTIMIZE_INLINING
                echo "[y]" "$objfile" 1&gt;&amp;2
        fi
fi

exec gcc $extra "${args[@]}"
</code></pre>

<p>This hashes the object file name with SHA-1, then checks a given bit of the
hash out of the first 32 bits (identified by the <code>$BIT</code> environment variable).
If the bit is 0, it builds without <code>CONFIG_OPTIMIZE_INLINING</code>. If it is 1,
it builds with <code>CONFIG_OPTIMIZE_INLINING</code>. I found that the kernel had around
685 object files at this point (my minimization effort had paid off), which
requires about 10 bits for a unique identification. This hash-based approach
also has one neat property: I can choose to only worry about crashing outcomes
(where the bit is 0), since it is much harder to prove that a given kernel build
does not crash (as the crashes are probabilistic and can take quite a while
sometimes).</p>

<p>I built 32 kernels, one for each bit of the SHA-1 prefix, which only took 29
minutes. Then I started testing them, and every time I got a crash, I narrowed
down a regular expression of possible SHA-1 hashes to only those with zero bits
at those specific positions. At 8 crashes (and thus zero bits), I was down to 4
object files, and a couple were looking promising. Once I hit the 10th crash,
there was a single match.</p>

<pre><code>$ grep '^[0246][012389ab][0189][014589cd][028a][012389ab][014589cd]' objs_0.txt
6b9cab4f arch/x86/entry/vdso/vclock_gettime.o
</code></pre>

<p>vDSO code. Of course.</p>

<h2 id="vdso-shenanigans">vDSO shenanigans</h2>

<p>The kernel’s vDSO is not actually kernel code. vDSO is a small shared library
that the kernel places in the address space of every process, and which allows
apps to perform certain special system calls without ever leaving user mode.
This increases performance significantly, while still allowing the kernel to
change the implementation details of those system calls as needed.</p>

<p>In other words, vDSO is GCC-compiled code, built with the kernel, that ends up
being linked with every userspace app. It’s userspace code. This explains why
the kernel and its compiler mattered: it wasn’t about the kernel itself, but
about a shared library provided by the kernel! And Go uses the vDSO for
performance. Go also happens to have a (rather insane, in my opinion) policy of
reinventing its own standard library, so it does not use any of the standard
Linux glibc code to call vDSO, but rather rolls its own calls (and syscalls
too).</p>

<p>So what does flipping <code>CONFIG_OPTIMIZE_INLINING</code> do to the vDSO? Let’s look at
the assembly.</p>

<p>With <code>CONFIG_OPTIMIZE_INLINING=n</code>:</p>

<p>Interestingly, <code>CONFIG_OPTIMIZE_INLINING=y</code>, which is supposed to allow GCC to
inline <em>less</em>, actually resulted in it inlining <em>more</em>: <code>vread_tsc</code> is inlined in
that version, while not in the <code>CONFIG_OPTIMIZE_INLINING=n</code> version. But
<code>vread_tsc</code> isn’t marked inline at all, so GCC is perfectly within its right to
behave like this, as counterintuitive as it may be.</p>

<p>But who cares if a function is inlined? Where’s the actual problem? Well,
looking closer at the non-inline version…</p>

<pre><code>  30:	55                   	push   %rbp
  31:	48 89 e5             	mov    %rsp,%rbp
  34:	48 81 ec 20 10 00 00 	sub    $0x1020,%rsp
  3b:	48 83 0c 24 00       	orq    $0x0,(%rsp)
  40:	48 81 c4 20 10 00 00 	add    $0x1020,%rsp
</code></pre>

<p>Why is GCC allocating over 4KiB of stack? That’s not a stack allocation, that’s
a <em>stack probe</em>, or more specifically, the result of the <code>-fstack-check</code> GCC
<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/Stack-Checking.html">feature</a>.</p>

<p>Gentoo Linux enables <nobr><code>-fstack-check</code></nobr> by default on its hardened
profile. This is a mitigation for the
<a href="https://www.qualys.com/2017/06/19/stack-clash/stack-clash.txt">Stack Clash</a>
vulnerability. While <nobr><code>-fstack-check</code></nobr> is an old GCC feature and not
intended for this, it turns out it effectively mitigates the issue (I’m told
proper Stack Clash protection will be in GCC 8). As a side-effect, it causes
some fairly silly behavior, where every non-leaf function (that is, a function
that makes function calls) ends up probing the stack 4 KiB ahead of the stack
pointer. In other words, code compiled with <nobr><code>-fstack-check</code></nobr>
potentially needs at least 4 KiB of stack space, unless it is a leaf function
(or a function where every call was inlined).</p>

<p>Go loves small stacks.</p>

<pre><code>TEXT runtime·walltime(SB),NOSPLIT,$16
	// Be careful. We're calling a function with gcc calling convention here.
	// We're guaranteed 128 bytes on entry, and we've taken 16, and the
	// call uses another 8.
	// That leaves 104 for the gettime code to use. Hope that's enough!
</code></pre>

<p>Turns out 104 bytes aren’t enough for everybody. Certainly not for my kernel.</p>

<p>It’s worth pointing out that the vDSO specification makes no mention of maximum
stack usage guarantees, so this is squarely Go’s fault for making invalid
assumptions.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This perfectly explains the symptoms. The stack probe is an <code>orq</code>, which is a
logical OR with 0. This is a no-op, but effectively probes the target address
(if it is unmapped, it will segfault). But we weren’t seeing segfaults in vDSO
code, so how was this breaking Go? Well, OR with 0 isn’t really a no-op. Since
<code>orq</code> is not an atomic instruction, what really happens is the CPU reads the
memory address and then writes it back. This creates a race condition. If other
threads are running in parallel on other CPUs, <code>orq</code> might effectively wind up
undoing a memory write that occurs simultaneously. Since the write was out of
the stack bounds, it was likely intruding on other threads’ stacks or random
data, and, when the stars line up, undoing a memory write. This is also why
<code>GOMAXPROCS=1</code> works around the issue, since that prevents two threads from
effectively running Go code at the same time.</p>

<p>What’s the fix? I left that up to the Go devs. Their solution ultimately was to
<a href="https://github.com/golang/go/commit/a158382b1c9c0b95a7d41865a405736be6bc585f">pivot to a larger stack</a>
before calling vDSO functions. This introduces a small speed penalty
(nanoseconds), but it’s acceptable. After building <code>node_exporter</code> with the
fixed Go toolchain, the crashes went away.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The new rules&nbsp;will impact the prison telecom industry deeply. Loss of revenue is expected to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars (though not equal to the savings to incarcerated people and their families as the industry's business model shifts and correctional agencies purchase security and surveillance services directly). This&nbsp;comes as the two largest market players, Aventiv and ViaPath, each navigate financial crises. Aventiv recently<a href="https://worthrises.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=d5deffca38b8d1f6cd5d6dfc9&amp;id=79823f19b8&amp;e=6c5990aeb2" target="_blank"> </a>effectively <a href="https://worthrises.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=d5deffca38b8d1f6cd5d6dfc9&amp;id=2bef16be55&amp;e=6c5990aeb2" target="_blank">defaulted on its $1.3 billion debt</a> after a year of failed refinancing efforts. ViaPath was reportedly closing in on a $1.5 billion refinancing deal until news of the <a href="https://worthrises.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=d5deffca38b8d1f6cd5d6dfc9&amp;id=2e6d95e517&amp;e=6c5990aeb2" target="_blank">regulations killed the deal</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The FCC’s new rules also come as an increasing number of states move to make prison and jail communication free. In 2023, Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Colorado each passed legislation to make prison calls free. California made prison calls free in 2022 and Connecticut in 2021. Campaigns are currently underway in more than a dozen other states.</p><p><strong>Former FCC Acting Chairwoman of the FCC and member of the Board of Directors of the Benton Institute for Broadband &amp; Society Mignon Clyburn </strong>said,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>“Today marks a major milestone on the long road to right a market dysfunction that has wronged incarcerated persons and their loved ones for decades. &nbsp;I have nothing but praise for Chairwoman Rosenworcel and her fellow Commissioners who moved this item forward, and the hard-working FCC staff for crafting forceful rules that are faithful to the goals of the Martha Wright-Reed Just and Reasonable Communications Act.”</p><p>“Today, we cross a major milestone in the decades-long quest to prevent gauging of families when they pay to communicate with their incarcerated loved ones. With the Federal Communications Commission vote today, prices are dropping between 8 and 14 cents per minute from existing voice calling caps, and video communication will benefit from rate protections for the first time. Lower cost communication means more memories and tighter bonds, it means more opportunities to say 'I love you' and 'I miss you' at the moment they can make a huge difference in a child's life. It brings people together instead of breaking them apart under the weight of impossible financial burdens,” said <strong>Cheryl A. Leanza, policy advisor to the United Church of Christ Media Justice Ministry.</strong> “The journey to this day has been decades in the making, from Mrs. Martha Wright-Reed, who was willing to put&nbsp;her name on a lawsuit more than 20 years ago, to bi-partisan champions in Congress, hard-working agency leaders and staff, fellow advocates, and most important: the countless family members and incarcerated people who took the time to tell their stories, write postcards, contact their legislators or attend a Federal Communications Commission listening session. It all really does make a difference.”</p><p>“Today, 18 months from the passage of the Marta Wright-Reed Just and Reasonable Communications Act of 2022, the Federal Communications Commission took action to end predatory prison phone rates. After a decade of advocacy, incarcerated individuals and their loved ones will be able to communicate with each other without the barrier of burdensome fees. The absence of these predatory rates is life-changing, potentially lowering rates of depression, isolation, and loneliness incarcerated individuals experience while in prison and helping them succeed when reentering their communities,” said <strong>Koustubh “K.J.” Bagchi, Vice President of the Center for Civil Rights and Technology at The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.</strong></p><p>“Incarcerated people and their loved ones have paid an unconscionably high price for the greed of the companies who provide telecom services to prisons, jails and detention centers. Thankfully, that’s about to change,” said <strong>Heather Franklin, Internet Campaign Director at Free Press. </strong>“The ability for incarcerated people to maintain regular communication with loved ones, legal counsel and clergy is a human-rights issue. Incarcerated people should be able to connect and communicate without being subject to extortionate rates. We’re grateful for the work of FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel, the other commissioners, agency staff, and decades of work by advocates across the country who’ve made today’s strides possible.”&nbsp;</p><p>“The FCC’s action today will help to ensure that families no longer have to pay inflated, predatory rates to speak to their incarcerated loved ones,” said <strong>Ariel Nelson, staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center, who leads its Criminal Justice Debt &amp; Reintegration Project.</strong> “We are grateful the Commission has also put a stop to two enduring areas of consumer abuse–outrageous fees and site commissions–bringing meaningful financial relief and connection to families across the country.”</p><p>"With today’s order, the FCC affirmed what our movement has been saying for decades: The families of incarcerated people should not be shouldering the costs of their loved ones’ incarceration," said <strong>Peter Wagner, Executive Director of the Prison Policy Initiative. </strong>"Capping the costs of all phone and video calls, as the FCC has done, will bring relief to millions of families, and other provisions in its order will prevent the exploitation of consumers through fees and deceptive pricing. We are glad to see the FCC take these steps toward true consumer protection for incarcerated people."</p><p>“For years, incarcerated people unable to afford exorbitant call rates have been denied the ability to easily communicate with their loved ones, their communities, and even their attorneys. These excessive communications costs hurt incarcerated people as well as their families and communities. By requiring just and reasonable rates, the FCC is working to keep families together and to ease the return to society of incarcerated people. We commend Chairwoman Rosenworcel for her leadership in keeping incarcerated people connected and applaud the FCC for requiring reasonable rates for these vital communications,”<strong> </strong>said <strong>Al Kramer, senior fellow at Public Knowledge.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“We applaud the leadership of Chairwoman Rosenworcel and the Federal Communications Commission for taking this important and monumental action. The FCC’s order serves as a transformative win for incarcerated peoples and their loved ones who for far too long have had to grapple with outrageous rates,” said <strong>Rebekah P. Goodheart, Jenner &amp; Block LLP, pro bono counsel to the Wright Petitioners. </strong>“Thanks to the tireless advocacy of various groups and civil rights organizations, much-needed relief will be provided.”</p><p>"It’s exciting to see that the Federal Communications Commission is taking steps to enact the Martha Wright-Reed legislation to lower the cost of prison phone calls," said&nbsp;<strong>Brandon Tucker, Senior Policy Director at Color Of Change.</strong> "This is a major step in prison justice. Phone call costs have been predatory and it has never made sense for families of incarcerated people to pay high amounts of money to stay in contact with their loved ones. The system was rooted in corporate greed and not rehabilitation. It is unacceptable that families have gone into debt accepting phone calls from jails and prison. Thank you to Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel and other commissioners for rectifying this misstep in our judicial system."</p></div><p><a href="https://worthrises.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=d5deffca38b8d1f6cd5d6dfc9&amp;id=132d7170b3&amp;e=6c5990aeb2" target="_blank">Worth Rises</a> is a non-profit advocacy organization dedicated to dismantling the prison industry and ending the exploitation of those it targets.

                  <p>if one of the people i manage is not up to the task the fault is mine. I've hired them. I should setup a system of hard gained trust and automation to avoid or at least minimize them fucking up. When fuckups happen, they are my fuckups. Critical systems don't survive only on trust, obviously. If I don't setup the teams and the systems properly, my bosses will also take the blame for having put me in that position.
I'm not advocating for lower layers to avoid responsabilities. But if an head needs to roll you should look above. That said, peole are hardened by fuckups, so there are better solutions than rolling heads, usually.</p>

He didn’t think any of this was necessary, that we should roll it out in one fell swoop, have everything to auto-update all the time, and constantly yapped about how many bigger enterprises than ours completed their rollouts in just a couple of weeks.</p><p>He actually threatened to fire us as a client because he claimed he didn’t want the CS brand associated with an org that was “fully protected” by CS.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">“All in.” Your opponent slides a stack of chips across the high-stakes poker table. You glance back at your cards, a pair of sixes. The game is <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/game-theorists-crack-poker/">Texas Hold’em</a>. Only two of you remain, and no community (face-up) cards have been dealt yet. Things rarely get simpler than this in poker, and you have a binary decision to make: call (match your opponent’s bet) or fold (give up). To a professional player, though, every detail demands consideration. What was the betting pattern before the all-in push? Who acted first? How many chips does each player have, and how many are in the pot? When will the blinds, or forced bets, increase? And of course, how likely are sixes to win the hand? You’ve studied poker strategy, memorized <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-gambling-strategy-thats-guaranteed-to-make-money-and-why-you-should-never-use-it/">probability</a> tables and run the numbers in your head. It all points to folding as the objectively best decision. But you’ve noticed over a prolonged tournament that your opponent has a tendency to overbet with mediocre hands. Do you stick with your training and fold or adjust your strategy on the fly to exploit the weakness you’ve observed?</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">This question of whether to use what’s known as “game theory optimal versus exploitative play” captures a central conversation in <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ai-conquers-six-player-poker/">high-level poker</a>. Its mathematical underpinnings trace back 80 years, but rapid advances in AI have brought mid-20th-century math to the forefront of modern gaming. New tools teach poker players <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/physics-of-texas-hold-em-poker/">optimal strategy</a> for the game, so why would they ever decline to use it?</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">[<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/games/"><i>Play science-inspired games, puzzles and quizzes in our new Games section</i></a>]</p><hr><h2>On supporting science journalism</h2><p>If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by<!-- --> <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/getsciam/">subscribing</a>. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.</p><hr><h2 data-block="sciam/heading">Optimal Play?</h2><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Objectively optimal play might seem counterintuitive in a game based on randomly dealt cards and messy human psychology. Take bluffing—when a player pretends they hold an unbeatable hand to scare an opponent into folding. Lying about one’s cards feels inherently psychological and resists a rigorous mold of objectivity. But we should never underestimate mathematicians’ knack for turning human behavior into tidy equations.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">In fact, the foundational 1944 book on mathematical game theory by mathematician John von Neumann and economist Oskar Morgenstern, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1r2gkx"><i>Theory of Games and Economic Behavior</i></a>, highlighted poker as a central example. The authors analyzed a simplified variant that distilled the game down to its most fundamental dynamics: two players would each receive a number between 0 and 1, with higher numbers representing stronger hands, and then engage in a single round of betting. Von Neumann and Morgenstern proved not only that an optimal strategy exists but also that bluffing is an essential part of that strategy.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Of course, Texas Hold’em packs a great deal more complexity than this toy example. Who’s to say that an optimal strategy even exists in full-fledged multiplayer poker? The late mathematician John Nash, that’s who. In the 1950s Nash, who went on to win a Nobel prize in economics in 1994 and was later depicted in the 2001 biopic <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/beautiful-mind-john-nash-s-schizophrenia-disappeared-as-he-aged/"><i>A Beautiful Mind</i></a><i>,</i> propelled the then nascent field of game theory. His most famous discovery, now called a Nash equilibrium, occurs when no player of a game would benefit by deviating from their chosen strategy (assuming others don’t deviate from theirs).</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-is-game-theory-and-w/">Game theorists</a> consider this condition optimal because if you and I play a game where we each begin with any old strategy, and then I adapt mine to take advantage of what I see you doing, and then you counter-adapt to my change, and so on, we will eventually reach a steady state in which neither of us can keep improving. With a Nash equilibrium, players can even announce their strategies in advance, and still everybody’s best course will be to stick with the equilibrium. In a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.36.1.48">one-page paper</a> in 1950, John Nash proved that <i>every</i> finite competitive game—from mahjong to Magic: The Gathering—has at least one Nash equilibrium.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Despite its name, game theory applies to a broad spectrum of topics beyond traditional games, including economic systems, nuclear deterrence and evolutionary biology. To researchers in this field, games refer to any interactions among rational decision-makers whose actions and payoffs can be rigorously defined and analyzed. So Nash’s theorem has wide-reaching implications. <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/cocktail-party-physics/knowing-when-to-fold-em-the-science-of-poker/">In poker</a>, it justifies the search for optimal strategies in a game once thought to rely on gut instinct and reading tells.</p><h2 data-block="sciam/heading">An AI Poker Revolution</h2><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Just because we know that Texas Hold’em has a Nash equilibrium, that doesn’t mean we know what it looks like. As games ratchet up in complexity, their optimal strategies tend to become harder to figure out. Anyone could learn how to play perfect tic-tac-toe in one sitting by memorizing a few move sequences. For a more elaborate game such as checkers, which always ends in a draw with perfect play, humans could never memorize enough variations to implement the optimal strategy. <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1144079">Scientists have created unbeatable algorithms</a> that play optimally, however, because computers can store massive databases of positions and extensively search the game tree in a way that humans cannot. Meanwhile chess computers have dominated the best human players since around 1997 (when world champion Garry Kasparov lost a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/history/deep-blue">historic match</a> to IBM’s Deep Blue), yet chess computers still don’t exhibit optimal play—the next generation of chess engines will crush today’s.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Unlike chess, poker involves <i>imperfect information</i>. Players know their own cards but not their competitors’, which makes the game more daunting to model computationally. This explains why the algorithmic revolution in poker didn’t come until the recent AI boom. In 2015 computer scientists <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1259433">announced an algorithm</a> that displayed essentially perfect play for a restricted version of the game with only two players and constrained bet sizes. Only four years later, we got <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aay2400">the first superhuman AI for multiplayer Texas Hold’em</a>. A flurry of commercially available software tools called “solvers” followed, and in the span of a few years every rounder (person who plays poker for a living) with a few hundred dollars to spare had a card shark at their fingertips who could tell them how to play in almost every situation.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">“The game went from being this fuzzy art to a hard science,” says Liv Boeree, a former professional poker player. To stay ahead in today’s environment, advanced players study the game by using computer programs such as <a href="https://piosolver.com/">PioSOLVER</a>, which approximates optimal strategies. For simple and common situations, pros will memorize the machine’s recommendations, whereas they glean more high-level lessons from its behavior in rare and more complicated situations. For any elite poker player, studying with these solvers is essential. “If you want to play high stakes against the best, absolutely ... you’d get eaten alive [if you didn’t use solvers],” says Boeree, a World Series of Poker champion. “There were some players who just rejected the entire notion, and they didn’t work with solvers..., and for the most part, they got left behind.”</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">AI has both confirmed some common wisdom about Texas Hold’em strategy and overturned some maxims that players had gotten wrong. For example, computers find success in “<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aay2400">donk betting</a>”—initiating the first bet on a round of betting after merely calling another player’s bet on the previous round—despite the folk belief that donk betting is an <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aay2400">amateur move</a>. AIs also play a wider variety of hands in situations where expert humans tend to fold. Like chess engines, multiplayer poker solvers don’t literally play optimally, but they dominate humans thoroughly enough that we have a lot to learn from them.</p><h2 data-block="sciam/heading">How to Win</h2><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">In defining the Nash equilibrium, I smuggled in a critical detail: equilibrium occurs when no player would benefit by deviating from their chosen strategy (assuming others don’t deviate from theirs). When other players <i>do </i>deviate despite this, however, it’s often wise to deviate in response.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Take rock-paper-scissors as an illustrative example. What is its Nash equilibrium? Think for a moment: What strategy from both players would leave no incentive to deviate? Answer: players should toss rock, paper and scissors perfectly at random; each has a one third chance of appearing, regardless of all previous rounds. You can announce this strategy to your opponent in advance, and they will be helpless to take advantage of your candor.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">If you and your opponent both play this equilibrium strategy, you can expect to win half of the decisive rounds (ignoring ties). Now suppose your opponent deviates. In the extreme case, imagine they always play paper. If you stick with the equilibrium strategy, then still you’ll win half of the decisive rounds because you play the winning scissors and the losing rock with equal frequency. But you can instead exploit your opponent’s deviation by always playing scissors and cutting their paper on every round. Less dramatic deviations still give you opportunities to exploit. For example, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep05830">empirical research on rock-paper-scissors</a> shows that when people win one round, they are slightly more likely to repeat the throw that they just won with. Knowing this can give you an edge. If you just lost to rock, for example, then play paper next because your opponent is likely to throw rock again. The Nash equilibrium is the only strategy that is not susceptible to exploitation.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">The same dynamics play out in poker at a much more complicated scale. As players learn more optimal techniques from their AI collaborators, they also learn how to sniff out when their opponents fall short of optimal play and how best to punish them.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">You might think there’s a catch here. If your opponent deviates, isn’t the optimal decision to exploit them ruthlessly rather than to blindly stick to the Nash equilibrium and leave potential money on the table? If you discover that an opponent deviates from the Nash equilibrium in predictable ways, then deviating yourself to exploit their weakness may net you more money. As soon as you exploit them, however, <i>you’re</i> now veering from the equilibrium and opening <i>yourself</i> up to exploitation. If your opponent always throws paper and you start only throwing scissors, eventually they’ll catch on and start rocking your scissors.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">As former poker pro Igor Kurganov puts it, “any time you pick up on a mistake by your opponent, you improve your model of how they think about the game, adjust how you play against them to account for that mistake and, by that, become exploitable yourself.”</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Most players agree that to stay competitive at the top levels of poker they must use a blend of game theory’s optimal and exploitative play. Optimal is more defensive, whereas exploitative is more offensive. Some teachers recommend that you should begin a tournament by emulating optimal play—and only after you’ve had time to observe your opponent’s weaknesses should you sprinkle in your exploits. The flexibility to switch between strategies separates the fish from the sharks. “This whole process works better the more certain you are that you’re smarter than [your opponent] about the game,” Kurganov says, adding that “you do less exploitative adjustments when you feel like they’re as good or better than you.”</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">For some, the emergence of superhuman poker engines has sapped the game of its intrigue, while others contend that computers have added a new layer to the game. Boeree, who retired from pro poker in 2019 and now works as a science communicator, philanthropist and podcast host, falls more into the former camp. “It felt like it took a little bit of the magic out of the game, like, ‘Oh, okay, the mystery has been solved,’” she says. But Boeree acknowledges that the new age of poker has no shortage of enthusiasts. “Since COVID it’s been booming,” she adds. “The World Series of Poker got more players than ever before last year. Records are getting smashed. So clearly it has not killed the game.” Instead we might say that the changing landscape of poker is still finding its equilibrium.</p></div></div>]]></description>
