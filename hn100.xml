		<p><span>A serendipitous observation in a Chemical Engineering lab at Penn Engineering has led to a surprising discovery: a new class of nanostructured materials that can pull water from the air, collect it in pores and release it onto surfaces without the need for any external energy. <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adu8349">The research</a>, published in </span><i><span>Science Advances</span></i><span>, was conducted by an interdisciplinary team, including </span><a href="https://directory.seas.upenn.edu/daeyeon-lee/"><span>Daeyeon Lee</span></a><span>, Russell Pearce and Elizabeth Crimian Heuer Professor in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering (CBE), </span><a href="https://directory.seas.upenn.edu/amish-j-patel/"><span>Amish Patel</span></a><span>, Professor in CBE, Baekmin Kim, a postdoctoral scholar in Lee’s lab and first author, and </span><a href="https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/guldin-stefan"><span>Stefan Guldin</span></a><span>, Professor in Complex Soft Matter at the Technical University of Munich. Their work describes a material</span> <span>that</span> <span>could open the door to new ways to collect water from the air in arid regions and devices that cool electronics or buildings using the power of evaporation.</span></p>

<p><span>“We weren’t even trying to collect water,” says Lee. “We were working on another project testing the combination of hydrophilic nanopores and hydrophobic polymers when R Bharath Venkatesh, a former Ph.D. student in our lab, noticed water droplets appearing on a material we were testing. It didn’t make sense. That’s when we started asking questions.”</span></p>
<p><span>Those questions led to an in-depth study of a new type of amphiphilic nanoporous material: one that blends water-loving (hydrophilic) and water-repelling (hydrophobic) components in a unique nanoscale structure. The result is a material that both captures moisture from air and simultaneously pushes that moisture out as droplets.</span></p>
<p><b>Water-Collecting Nanopores</b></p>
<p><span>When water condenses on surfaces, it usually requires either a drop in temperature or very high humidity levels. Conventional water harvesting methods rely on these principles, often requiring energy input to chill surfaces or a dense fog to form to collect water passively from humid environments. But Lee and Patel’s system works differently.</span></p>
<p><span>Instead of cooling, their material relies on capillary condensation, a process where water vapor condenses inside tiny pores even at lower humidity. This is not new. What </span><i><span>is</span></i><span> new is that in their system, the water doesn’t just stay trapped inside the pores, as it usually does in these types of materials.</span></p>
<p><span>“In typical nanoporous materials, once the water enters the pores, it stays there,” explains Patel. “But in our material, the water moves, first condensing inside the pores, then emerging onto the surface as droplets. That’s never been seen before in a system like this, and at first we doubted our observations.”</span></p>
<p><b>A Material That Defies Physics&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><span>Before they understood what was happening, the researchers first thought that water was simply condensing onto the surface of the material due to</span> <span>an artifact of their experimental setup, such as a temperature gradient in the lab. To rule that out, they increased the thickness of the material to see if the amount of water collected on the surface would change.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“If what we were observing was due to surface condensation alone, the thickness of the material wouldn’t change the amount of water present,” explains Lee.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But, the total amount of water collected increased as the film’s thickness increased, proving that the water droplets forming on the surface came from inside the material.</span></p>
<p><span>Even more surprising: the droplets didn’t evaporate quickly, as thermodynamics would predict.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“According to the curvature and size of the droplets, they should have been evaporating,” says Patel. “But they were not; they remained stable for extended periods.”</span></p>
<p><span>With a material that could potentially defy the laws of physics on their hands, Lee and Patel sent their design off to a collaborator to see if their results were replicable.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“We study porous films under a wide range of conditions, using subtle changes in light polarization to probe complex nanoscale phenomena,” says Guldin. “But we’ve never seen anything like this. It’s absolutely fascinating and will clearly spark new and exciting research.”</span></p>

<p><span>Nanopores in action under electron microscope imagery showing water droplets forming and being replenished by stored water in the material itself.</span></p>
<p><b>A Stabilized Cycle of Condensation and Release</b></p>
<p><span>It turns out that they had created a material with just the right balance of water-attracting nanoparticles and water-repelling plastic — polyethylene — to create a nanoparticle film with this special property.</span></p>
<p><span>“We accidentally hit the sweet spot,” says Lee. “The droplets are connected to hidden reservoirs in the pores below. These reservoirs are continuously replenished from water vapor in the air, creating a feedback loop made possible by this perfect balance of water-loving and water-repelling materials.”</span></p>
<p><b>A Platform for Passive Water Harvesting and More</b></p>
<p><span>Beyond the physics-defying behavior, the materials’ simplicity is part of what makes them so promising. Made from common polymers and nanoparticles using scalable fabrication methods, these films could be integrated into passive water harvesting devices for arid regions, surfaces for cooling electronics or smart coatings that respond to ambient humidity.</span></p>
<p><span>“We’re still uncovering the mechanisms at play,” says Patel. “But the potential is exciting. We’re learning from biology — how cells and proteins manage water in complex environments — and applying that to design better materials.”</span></p>
<p><span>“This is exactly what Penn does best, bringing together expertise in chemical engineering, materials science, chemistry and biology to solve big problems,” adds Lee.</span></p>
<p><span>The next steps include studying how to optimize the balance of hydrophilic and hydrophobic components, scale the material for real-world use and investigating how to make the collected droplets roll off surfaces efficiently.</span></p>
<p><span>Ultimately, the researchers hope this discovery will lead to technologies that offer clean water in dry climates or more sustainable cooling methods using only the water vapor already in the air.</span></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://mondaybits.com/lieferando-captured-6-percent-of-restaurant-related-domain-names/">https://mondaybits.com/lieferando-captured-6-percent-of-restaurant-related-domain-names/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44095250">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
        <p>I recently decided to compile a <strong>very large list of domain names </strong>for the German country code top-level domain <strong><em>.de</em></strong>. I did this with the help of the <a href="https://commoncrawl.org/?ref=mondaybits.com" rel="noreferrer">Common Crawl project</a> which provides a free, open repository of web crawl data and web graphs for the last years.</p><p>A few command line commands and a small <em>bash shell script</em> was all it took to compile a nice list of <strong>roughly 9 million .de domain names.</strong></p><div><p>💡</p><p>If you want to know more about how exactly I compiled the domain name list, just let me know and I might write about it in another blog post.</p></div><p>The resulting list is by no means complete and also not up-to-date, but it can be a nice starting point for further analysis and investigations. One of which I am going to write about in this post.</p><h2 id="enter-the-restaurant-world">Enter the restaurant world</h2><p>I was interested in domain names that belonged to restaurants and eating places in general. A simple but quite effective way to achieve this was to filter the domain names by German words that indicate such eating places:</p><ul>
<li>Restaurant</li>
<li>Gasthaus</li>
<li>Gasthof</li>
<li>Gaststätte</li>
<li>Wirtshaus</li>
<li>Gastwirtschaft</li>
<li>Schänke</li>
<li>Speisewirtschaft</li>
<li>Speiselokal</li>
<li>Speisehaus</li>
<li>Speiserestaurant</li>
<li>Speisegaststätte</li>
<li>Gastlokal</li>
<li>Kneipe</li>
<li>Pizzaria</li>
</ul>
<p>Since I was running this analysis on my windows desktop, <em>grep </em>was not directly available. So I used the <em>findstr PowerScript command</em><strong> </strong>instead to do this filtering:</p><pre><code>findstr /I "Restaurant Gasthaus Gasthof Gaststaette Wirtshaus ..." huge-domain-list.txt
</code></pre>
<p>This yielded a still impressive list of about <strong>31.000 domain names related to German restaurants</strong>.</p><h2 id="whos-still-alive">Who's still alive?</h2><p>Since I knew that the original list is outdated by definition, I had to check which domain names were still active. My first attempt to do this was also with a PowerShell script. This worked in principle and I was somewhat impressed by the capabilities that PowerShell provided, but at the same time the unfamiliar syntax turned me off and most importantly the speed was not great. So I created a small <em>Golang </em>program to get this job done, which worked great due Golang's <em>concurrency </em>features.</p><ul>
<li><strong>63% of the domain names were still active</strong> (roughly 20.000 domains)</li>
<li><strong>49% of the domains had redirects</strong> (mostly from http:// to https://)</li>
<li><strong>14% of the domains still serve http://</strong></li>
<li><strong>37% of the domains did not exist anymore</strong> or returned other errors</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lets-do-some-manual-spot-checks">Let's do some manual spot checks...</h2><p>I was happy to have a list of <strong>20.000 restaurant domain names</strong> to work with and started some manual spot checks. After looking at 20 randomly selected websites from the list, I made two observations:</p><ol>
<li><em><strong>Domain Parking</strong></em> <strong>was another group of domain names to filter out</strong></li>
<li><em><strong>Lieferando.de</strong></em> <strong>had captured a significant number of domain names</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>I was not surprised about the first observation, because I had noticed already quite often that many good domain names are "parked". But <strong>that lieferando.de thing caught my attention</strong>. The domains that were captured by lieferando.de did not redirect to lieferando.de, but instead showed their logo and a link to their website.</p><h2 id="how-many-of-them">How many of them?</h2><p>With just a small extension to my <em>Golang </em>program I could find all the domain names form the initial list, that were captured by lieferando.de:</p><p><strong>5.7% of the active domains from the restaurant domain list belong to lieferando.de</strong></p><p>That is 1101 domain names. Here are some random examples:</p><ul>
<li>elba-restaurant-knigstein-im-taunus.de</li>
<li>gasthauskaiser.de</li>
<li>grill-restaurantnaxos.de</li>
<li>henne-alt-berlinerwirtshaus.de</li>
<li>kulturkneipe-brotfabrik-bonn.de</li>
</ul>
<p>The numbers are of course only estimates, since the initial domain list is not complete, but it provides some impression for the size of the topic.</p><h2 id="when-did-it-start">When did it start?</h2><p>I have not yet done a systematic analysis, but it seems (based on <em>WHOIS</em> entries for some domain names) that this "capturing" of restaurant domain names has started already before the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019 and continued at least until 2022 and potentially still continues.</p><h2 id="preliminary-conclusions">(Preliminary) Conclusions</h2><ol>
<li>The number of "lost" domain names provides evidence that German restaurants have been struggling in the 2019-2023 time frame. It would be interesting to revisit this analysis in one or two years to see who many more domain names have become inactive or taken over by lieferando.</li>
<li>Lieferando is using aggressive tactics to drive traffic to their site. Maybe this can be described as <em>growth hacking</em> or a way of <em>SEO</em>. It is apparently not even new.</li>
<li>The extend to which lieferando is using this method suggest that it is at least somewhat effective and probably quite cheap to implement.</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>GitHub issues is <em>almost</em> the best notebook in the world.</p>
<p>Free and unlimited, for both public and private notes.</p>
<p>Comprehensive Markdown support, including syntax highlighting for almost any language. Plus you can drag and drop images or videos directly onto a note.</p>
<p>It has fantastic inter-linking abilities. You can paste in URLs to other issues (in any other repository on GitHub) in a markdown list <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/1059#issuecomment-2907515045">like this</a>:</p>
<pre><code>- https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/1078
- https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/1080
</code></pre>
<p>Your issue will pull in the title of the other issue, plus that other issue will get back a link to yours - taking issue visibility rules into account.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of an issue showing user &quot;simonw&quot; posted yesterday containing text &quot;Current logs could do with a bit of a redesign around tools already, see:&quot; followed by two bullet points with green checkmark icons: &quot;Tools in LLM logs output should only show definition first time #1078&quot; and &quot;New design for logs involving tool calls (and maybe tool classes) #1080&quot;" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/issue-notes.jpg"></p>
<p>It has excellent search, both within a repo, across all of your repos or even across the whole of GitHub if you've completely forgotten where you put something.</p>
<p>It has a comprehensive API, both for exporting notes and creating and editing new ones. Add GitHub Actions, triggered by issue events, and you can automate it to do almost anything.</p>
<p>The one missing feature? Synchronized offline support. I still mostly default to Apple Notes on my phone purely because it works with or without the internet and syncs up with my laptop later on.</p>

              Earlier this month, I received a phone call from a user of <a title="Three Rings CIC" href="https://www.threerings.org.uk/"><em>Three Rings</em></a>, the volunteer/rota management
              software system I founded<sup><a id="footnote-ref-26608-1" name="footnote-ref-26608-1" href="#footnote-26608-1" title="Way back in 2002! We’re very nearly at the point where the Three Rings system is older than the youngest member of the Three Rings team. Speaking of which, we’re seeking volunteers to help expand our support team: if you’ve got experience of using&nbsp;Three Rings and an hour or two a week to spare helping to make volunteering easier for hundreds of thousands of people around the world, you should look us up!">1</a></sup>.
            </p>
            <p>
              We don’t strictly <em>offer</em> telephone-based tech support – our distributed team of volunteers doesn’t keep any particular “core hours” so we can’t say who’s available at any given
              time – but instead we answer email/Web based queries pretty promptly at any time of the day or week.
            </p>
            <p>
              But because I’ve called-back enough users over the years, it’s pretty much inevitable that a few probably have my personal mobile number saved. And because <a title="Venn-Euler digram comparing relationship breakups to tech layoffs, based on my recent experience" href="https://danq.me/2025/04/22/breakups-vs-layoffs/">I’ve been applying for a couple of
              interesting-looking new roles</a>, I’m in the habit of answering my phone even if it’s a number I don’t recognise.

                Many of the charities that benefit from&nbsp;<em>Three Rings</em> seem to form the impression that we’re all just sat around in an office, like this. But in fact many of my fellow
                volunteers only ever see me once or twice a year!

              After the first three such calls this month, I was really starting to wonder what had changed. Had we accidentally published my phone number, somewhere? So when the fourth tech support
              call came through, today (which began with a confusing exchange when I didn’t recognise the name of the caller’s charity, and he didn’t get my name right, and I initially figured it
              must be a wrong number), I had to ask: <em>where did you find this number?</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>“When I Google ‘Three Rings login’, it’s right there!”</em> he said.

              He was right. A Google search that surfaced Three Rings CIC’s “Google Business Profile” now featured… my personal mobile number. And a convenient “Call” button that connects you
              directly to it.

              Some <em>years</em> ago, I provided my phone number to Google as part of an identity verification process, but didn’t consent to it being shared publicly. And, indeed, they
              <em>didn’t</em> share it publicly, until – seemingly at random – they started doing so, presumably within the last few weeks.
            </p>
            <p>
              Concerned by this change, I logged into Google Business Profile to see if I could edit it back.

              I deleted my phone number from the business listing again, and within a few minutes it seemed to have stopped being served to random strangers on the Internet. Unfortunately deleting
              the phone number also made the “Your phone number was updated by Google” message disappear, so I never got to click the “Learn more” link to maybe get a clue as to how and why this
              change happened.

						<div>

									<p><span><img decoding="async" src="https://self-issued.info/images/ietf-logo.png" alt="IETF logo"></span>Ten years ago this week, in May 2015, the JSON Web Token (JWT) became <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519.html">RFC 7519</a>.  This was the culmination of a <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=1387">4.5 year journey</a> to create a simple JSON-based security token format and underlying JSON-based cryptographic standards.  The full set of RFCs published together was:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7515.html">RFC 7515</a>:  JSON Web Signature (JWS)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7516.html">RFC 7516</a>:  JSON Web Encryption (JWE)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7517.html">RFC 7517</a>:  JSON Web Key (JWK)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7518.html">RFC 7518</a>:  JSON Web Algorithms (JWA)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519.html">RFC 7519</a>:  JSON Web Token (JWT)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7520.html">RFC 7520</a>:  Examples of Protecting Content Using JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7521.html">RFC 7521</a>:  Assertion Framework for OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication and Authorization Grants</li>
<li><a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7522.html">RFC 7522</a>:  Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0 Profile for OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication and Authorization Grants</li>
<li><a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7523.html">RFC 7523</a>:  JSON Web Token (JWT) Profile for OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication and Authorization Grants</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s certainly the case that we co-designed JWT and its underpinnings with <a href="https://openid.net/connect">OpenID Connect</a>, while also attempting to create general-purpose, widely useful standards.  Given the adoption that’s ensued, it seems that we succeeded.</p>
<p>As I wrote in my post <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=2045">JWTs helping combat fraudulent and unwanted telephone calls</a>, “<i><b>It’s often said that one sign of a standard having succeeded is that it’s used for things that the inventors never imagined.</b></i>”  I’m gratified that this applies to JWT and the related specifications.  As was written in the post <a href="https://blog.duendesoftware.com/posts/20250520-essential-moments-in-the-oauth-and-openid-connect-timeline/">Essential Moments in the OAuth and OpenID Connect Timeline</a>, it’s now hard to imagine an online security world without these standards.</p>
<p>That said, there’s work underway to keep JWTs and the use of them secure for the next decade.  Five years ago, the <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8725.html">JSON Web Token Best Current Practices</a> specification was created.  As <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=2052">I wrote then</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
This Best Current Practices specification contains a compendium of lessons learned from real JWT deployments and implementations over that period. It describes pitfalls and how to avoid them as well as new recommended practices that enable proactively avoiding problems that could otherwise arise.
</p></blockquote>
<p>My coauthors <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yaronf/">Yaron Sheffer</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dickhardt/">Dick Hardt</a> and I are now updating the JWT BCP to describe additional threats and mitigations that have become known in the last five years.  See the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-sheffer-oauth-rfc8725bis-01.html">updated JSON Web Token Best Current Practices</a> specification.</p>
<p>Similarly, my coauthors <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bcampbell/">Brian Campbell</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cmort/">Chuck Mortimore</a> of the <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7523.html">JWT Profile for OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication and Authorization Grants</a> are updating it and related specifications to address vulnerabilities caused by <a href="https://openid.net/notice-of-a-security-vulnerability/">ambiguities in the audience values</a> of tokens sent to the authorization server.  See the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-rfc7523bis-01.html">RFC7523bis</a> specification.</p>
<p>I’m truly grateful that my coauthors <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ve7jtb/">John Bradley</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/natsakimura/">Nat Sakimura</a> and I created something useful and widely used ten years ago, of course with substantial contributions from the OAuth, JOSE, and OpenID Connect working groups.  I look forward to what the next decade will bring!</p>

Will include nuclear startup company tracking with details gleaned from statements and maybe extrapolated where necessary from simple simulations. Will include things like fuel cost and licensing progress. This way people can more easily separate vaporware from real nuclear, and keep track of promises vs delivery.</p></div></td></tr>

The entire thing is output to a single canvas element, which has forced me to write a number of the UI components from scratch that I'd normally take for granted. It's got an IndexedDB filesystem, and it's got apps. I'm almost done working on the first <i>real</i> app for it - a word processor akin to LisaWrite. Once I roll that out, I intend to do a ShowHN post.</p>

I had the idea last year, but the cost of sending images to an LLM made it too expensive (to run over about 1500 videos), but now it's fairly reasonable.</p><p>In the app you pick a folder with videos in it and it stores the path, metadata, extracts frames as images, uses a local whisper model to transcribe the audio into subtitles, then sends a selection of the snapshots and the subtitles to an LLM to be summarised. The LLM sends back an XML document with a bunch of details about the video, including a title, detailed summary and information on objects, text, people, animals, locations, distinct moments etc. Some of these are also timestamped and most have relationships (i.e this object belongs to this location, this text was on this object etc). I store all that in a local SQLLite database and then do another LLM call with this summary asking for categories and tags, then store them in the DB against each video. The App UI is essentially tags you can click to narrow down returned videos.</p><p>I plan on adding a natural language search (Maybe RAG -- need to look into the latest best way), have half added Projects so I can group videos after finding the ones I want, and have a bunch of other ideas for this too. I've been programming this with some early help from Aider and Claude Sonnet. It's getting a bit complex now, so I do the majority of code changes, though the AI has done a fair bit.

                  <p>I got tired of using Markdown and Org mode for writing web pages last year.  They're so limited, and so full of odd gotchas and limitations.  Instead, I started writing raw HTML, but with a post-processing step to add titles, headers, footers, and CSS, and to do macro-like things, e.g. insert pull quotes and YouTube viewers.  But raw HTML is not great, either.  I'm now working on an editor that lets me use Emacs-style commands and key bindings (e.g. character, paragraph, sentence, and word motion, deletion, and transposition; Emacs-style undo/redo; incremental search; and case conversions) to edit HTML in a WYSIWYG view.  The new editor does it all in a Webkit-based HTML view built with Tauri.  Editing this way is so much more pleasant and more powerful.  I plan to publish it under an MIT license once it's good enough.</p>

This suggests quality polarization rather than overall decline.</p><p>Genre trends:
Rising: Idle games, Strategy, RPGs (deeper gameplay mechanics)
Declining: Traditional arcade/action games
Stable: Puzzle and Adventure (web gaming staples)</p><p>Innovation wins: The highest-rated "hidden gems" all had one thing in common - innovative mechanics rather than genre variations. Games like "Detective Bass: Fish Out of Water" (9.3 rating) and "SYNTAXIA" (9.1 rating) show originality still pays off.</p><p>Market maturation: The correlation between rating and popularity is surprisingly weak (0.126), suggesting quality ≠ virality.

Basically, imagine if Roblox actually delivered on its promises to kids.</p><p>Most of what we're building will be open sourced, so that older kids / young adults will be able export their projects and share their creations stand-alone.</p><p>Of course, telling kids they can create their own game is only relevant is kids want to do that. We're not locked into one way of thinking. We've also modified Overcooked 2, a traditionally co-op game and introduced a visual scripting platform which allows kids to code their way through levels:</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ackD3G_D2Hc" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ackD3G_D2Hc</a></p><p>Overcooked 2 won't be the only game for which we do this.  Introducing coding to existing games is a fun way to teach kids to code, without yet burdening kids with too much creative freedom. Kids already want to play these games, so this approach allows us to bring educational tooling to kids rather than vice versa.</p><p>I used to be Head of Engineering at Ender, where we ran custom Minecraft servers for kids: <a href="https://joinender.com/" rel="nofollow">https://joinender.com/</a> and prior to that I was Head of Engineering at Prequel / Beta Camp, where we ran courses that helped teenagers learn about entrepreneurship: <a href="https://www.beta.camp/" rel="nofollow">https://www.beta.camp/</a>.

I mostly focused on idiomaticity, as it was the differentiator at the upper end.</p><p>The new benchmark has gone through a few iterations, and I'm still not super happy with it. Now it's just based on LLM scoring (this time 0-100), but with better stats, prompting, etc. I've still done some small scale tests on coherence, and I did some more today that I haven't published yet, and again they have DeepL and Lingvanex doing well because they tend towards quite rigid translations over idiomatic ones.

They operate in a super well-known, documented environment.</p><p>If we can replicate the same thing on business systems… that’s when the magic happens - just very hard to do without deep knowledge of those platforms and agentic AI because everyone does stuff differently in each org. The overlap of people with skills in both AI and specific business ops areas is absolutely tiny.</p><p>An example of where we’re using this is in a fully AI native CRM (part of SynthGrid - see <a href="https://mindfront.ai/" rel="nofollow">https://mindfront.ai</a>). We don’t even have any way to interface with it outside of AI, but we’d also never want to do so again anyway because the efficiency gains are so huge for us.</p><p>The Pareto frontier will continue to inexorably advance forward, dragging even the complex or non-standardized domains in with it. For those tightly integrated business systems, we’ll probably see huge gain in utility, if not function, from the improved underlying models combined with the excellent tools.

This is a big difference from ML because you're not having to worry too much about doing complex data engineering - or at least it solves the annoying ingestion problem in many cases.</p><p>Another observation is that most businesses don't have any ML engineering capabilities in-house - they're pretty much willing to pay a premium, because unlike the bespoke ML solutions, you can just do it with an off-the-shelf system (provided it's designed with the right validation loops).</p><p>The agent is in some ways an abstraction that just enables use and adoption - even if it would be orders of magnitude worse than normal ML solutions - it's competing against no solution, not ML-based ones.</p><p>Last thing is just around what level of autonomy people expect from these things. You can go pretty far, but like flipping N coins, the more you flip the greater the chance that something goes awry. Agents still need a lot of guidance and it's up to the system builders to bring that to them, either by connecting humans or very tightly integrated, well-designed tools.</p></div></td></tr>

Here are my ideas about my product:</p><p>- Manages the entire range of personal (and maybe business) information/content: Documents, Media, Messages (email, instant, etc.), Contacts, Bookmarks, Calendar, etc.</p><p>- Is tag based, so that where to put and find content is easy to answer. Think of a set of flat folders, on one or more devices, within which the files are stored with tags attached. Since people often find navigating/browsing files more natural than searching, virtual folders will be dynamically generated to guide navigation. Also, entire folders can be treated as atomic, and tagged/managed as one object (useful for repositories &amp; projects). And, heuristics (and maybe AI) will be used to automatically tag files when they are imported into the tool, greatly reducing the tedium of adding tags.</p><p>- Is file based, so that all information is physically stored as individual files. This allows information to be more easily managed on a physical level: moved around, backed up, exported/imported, searched, navigated, etc. So in addition to docs, each email/instant message, contact, scheduled task/event, bookmark, etc. would ultimately be stored as a file, unlocking all the things you can do with files.</p><p>- Has a local web-based UI launched from a local agent, so actual file content does not usually need to move across the network and stays local, and the tool is also easily multi-platform, with consistent UI irrespective of platform.</p><p>- Provides a cloud web UI as well, that communicates with content devices through the local agent, so that content stored across multiple devices can be managed in one central location, even without direct access to those devices, team/org features can be provided. However, file content still stays local, except when shared.</p><p>- Provides tools for exporting data as file from the data islands of various apps and service, and backing up as files to cloud storage services.</p><p>My vision is a situation where I am in charge of my own data irrespective of whatever device, app, or service I use, can ensure that it is always available and will not be lost, and that I can easily navigate and search through it all to find whatever I want, no matter how scattered and massive it is.</p><p>[1] Here are some of my issues with personal information management affordances of current tech, which is driving me to work on a solution:</p><p>- Our data is too bound to device and vendor islands. Can't easily move my information across Apple/Google/Whatsapp, etc accounts. Can't easily merge and de-duplicate either. I almost always somehow lose data whenever I have to move to a new phone, etc.</p><p>- Hard to own your data on many services: Discord, Slack, etc. Can't easily export, search.</p><p>- Hard to have a 360 overview and handle on all your data assets and query them in a consistent manner.</p><p>- Files as a unit of information storage and management is very ergonomic; we shouldn't allow that concept to be buried by vendors for their own gain.</p></div></td></tr>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">About</h2><a id="user-content-about" aria-label="Permalink: About" href="#about"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">plwm is a highly customizable X11 dynamic tiling window manager written in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog" rel="nofollow">Prolog</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Main goals of the project are: high code &amp; documentation quality; powerful yet easy customization; covering most common needs of tiling WM users; and to stay small, easy to use and hack on.</p>
<p dir="auto">Powered by <a href="https://www.swi-prolog.org/" rel="nofollow">SWI-Prolog</a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Feature highlights</h2><a id="user-content-feature-highlights" aria-label="Permalink: Feature highlights" href="#feature-highlights"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Easy to hack on, great way to introduce yourself to the logic programming paradigm and Prolog</li>
<li>Easy to configure: Prolog is declarative, so even though the config is source code, it feels like a dedicated format</li>
<li>Tiling is dynamic, with various layouts included by default: monocle, vertical/horizontal stacks, grid, left/right/top/bottom/centered master-stack, nrows(N), ncols(N)</li>
<li>Floating windows are also supported (move/resize with mouse)</li>
<li>Support for external bars, e.g. polybar, lemonbar</li>
<li>Nice level of EWMH compilance - <strong>partially still work-in-progress</strong></li>
<li>Performance: plwm is fast and light as a feather when it comes to resource usage (10-15 MB memory)</li>
<li>Dynamic workspace operations: create, rename, reindex or delete workspaces on the fly</li>
<li>Other features: multi-monitor support, inner/outer gaps, menu integrations with dmenu/rofi, rules, hooks, animations, command fifo and more</li>
<li>You can say: "My window manager is a semantic consequence of a set of axioms and implications which my computer is deducing/proving from an infinitely branching proof-tree"</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation</h2><a id="user-content-installation" aria-label="Permalink: Installation" href="#installation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Dependencies:</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>xorg</code> with <code>libx11-dev</code>, <code>libxft-dev</code>, <code>libxrandr-dev</code> (exact package names may vary)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.swi-prolog.org/Download.html" rel="nofollow">SWI-Prolog</a> (downloadable from most distros' package repos)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">On Ubuntu 22.04, easiest way to install them is:</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>$ sudo apt install xorg-dev swi-prolog</code></p>
<p dir="auto">Run:</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>$ make &amp;&amp; sudo make install</code></p>
<p dir="auto">By default, this will install plwm to <code>/usr/local/bin/</code>. The location can be adjusted in the <a href="https://github.com/Seeker04/plwm/blob/main/Makefile">Makefile</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Minimal environment</h2><a id="user-content-minimal-environment" aria-label="Permalink: Minimal environment" href="#minimal-environment"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Add the following line to the end of your <code>~/.xinitrc</code>:</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>exec plwm</code></p>
<p dir="auto">Then simply use the command <code>startx</code> in tty.</p>
<p dir="auto">For example, to automate this after logging in, put these lines in <code>~/.bash_profile</code> (or to whatever shell startup that matches your setup):</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="# Start X from login shell on tty1 if not already started
if [ -z &quot;$DISPLAY&quot; -a $(tty) = &quot;/dev/tty1&quot; ]; then
	exec startx
fi"><pre><span><span>#</span> Start X from login shell on tty1 if not already started</span>
<span>if</span> [ <span>-z</span> <span><span>"</span><span>$DISPLAY</span><span>"</span></span> <span>-a</span> <span><span>$(</span>tty<span>)</span></span> <span>=</span> <span><span>"</span>/dev/tty1<span>"</span></span> ]<span>;</span> <span>then</span>
	<span>exec</span> startx
<span>fi</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Using a display manager</h2><a id="user-content-using-a-display-manager" aria-label="Permalink: Using a display manager" href="#using-a-display-manager"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Please refer to the documentation of your display manager on how to set up sessions for custom WMs.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Display_manager" rel="nofollow">Here</a> you can find good references for this.</p>
<p dir="auto">For most modern display managers, you'll have to create a <code>/usr/share/xsessions/plwm.desktop</code> file with content like:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="[Desktop Entry]
Name=plwm
Comment=This session logs you into plwm
Exec=plwm
Icon=path-to-this-repo/plwm/img/logo.png
Type=Application"><pre><span>[Desktop Entry]</span>
<span>Name</span>=plwm
<span>Comment</span>=This session logs you into plwm

<p dir="auto">Command-line options are listed by running <code>plwm -h</code>. The manual plwm(1) also contains them as well as the default keybindings.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you have already used dynamic tiling WMs like dwm, then nothing should be too surprising in this section.</p>
<p dir="auto">All windows are <em>managed</em> by default. This means that whenever a window spawns, it will be added to a list. We call this list the <em>stack</em>. Also, the placement and the size of the windows are automatically calculated and set. This is determined by the currently active <em>layout</em> (stack, horizontal stack, grid, etc.).</p>
<p dir="auto">Some layouts are called "master-stack" layouts (the ones which have "master" in their names, e.g., <code>lmaster</code>). With these layouts the first <code>nmaster</code> number of windows (1 by default) in the stack go to a dedicated area. These are the <em>master windows</em>, which usually have the most space allocated for them. All other windows go to the remaining screen space.</p>
<p dir="auto">For example, if you start plwm with the default config, you have: <code>layout = lmaster</code>, <code>nmaster = 1</code>, <code>mfact = 2/3</code>, which means that the stack's top window will always be on the left side and occupy 2/3 of the screen width, while the other windows will be in a secondary stack on the right having 1/3 of the screen width.</p>
<p dir="auto">Some base promises of this approach:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Declarative window management: you only <em>tell</em> your system <em>what</em> window arrangement you want and don't do the movement/resizing (don't need to care about the <em>how</em>)</li>
<li>When new windows are spawned or old ones close, the layout will adapt automatically</li>
<li>Playing with the <code>layout</code>, <code>nmaster</code>, <code>mfact</code> trio, one can cook up mostly any kind of arrangement a situation may need, just with a few keystrokes.</li>
<li>100% of the screen space is utilized at all times, 99% if you use gaps :)</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Tip:</strong> <code>change_nmaster/1</code> and <code>change_mfact/1</code> can not only take deltas, but also exact values to assign. Omit the the <code>+</code> and <code>-</code> prefixes for this behavior.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Tip:</strong> For both <code>switch_workspace/1</code> and <code>move_focused_to_workspace/1</code>, you can also pass <code>prev_nonempty</code> and <code>next_nonempty</code> for switching/moving to the next <em>non-empty</em> workspace. The former can be nice for cycling through only the relevant workspaces. The latter can also work well when using the <code>hide_empty_workspaces</code> setting. You can also pass workspace <em>indices</em> instead of <em>names</em>. Use numbers starting from 1 <strong>without single quotes</strong> for this (of course, this only makes sense if you use different workspace names than the default '1'...'9').</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Tip:</strong> There are two parametric layouts which have no default keybindings: <code>nrows(N)</code> and <code>ncols(N)</code>. You can use them if you wish to have layouts with fixed number of rows or columns. For example, you can add a line like:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="super + shift + &quot;T&quot; -> layout:set_layout(ncols(3))"><pre><span>super</span> + <span>shift</span> + <span>"T"</span> -&gt; <span>layout</span>:set_layout(ncols(<span>3</span>))</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">then you'll have a triple stack layout where your windows will be evenly spread and sized among the three columns (can be nice with wide monitors).</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Tip:</strong> you can bind multiple (consecutive) actions to a single keystroke by writing a comma separated list of predicates enclosed in parentheses, i.e., <code>Keyes -&gt; (Act1, Act2,...)</code></p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Configuration</h2><a id="user-content-configuration" aria-label="Permalink: Configuration" href="#configuration"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Configuration is done by modifying <a href="https://github.com/Seeker04/plwm/blob/main/src/config.pl">config.pl</a> then recompiling with <code>make &amp;&amp; sudo make install</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">plwm will also attempt reading configuration when it starts from the first file among</p>

<li><code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/plwm/config.pl</code></li>
<li><code>$HOME/.config/plwm/config.pl</code></li>
<li><code>/etc/plwm/config.pl</code></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">if any exists, so users don't have to recompile each time if they don't wish to. Any values read from the runtime config will override the compiled in settings.</p>
<p dir="auto">A custom path can be specified with the <code>-c</code> flag.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Attention:</strong> the module name in the runtime config must be <code>runtime_config</code>!</p>
<p dir="auto">You can run:</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>$ make mkconfig</code></p>
<p dir="auto">which takes <code>src/config.pl</code> and generates the runtime config from it. Then keep modifying the latter while leaving the former in the default state. Or you can use the source one as a stable config and the runtime one for experimental overrides...</p>
<p dir="auto">While cooking your config, you can use the <code>-C</code> flag to quickly and easily check its validity.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">In <code>keymaps/1</code>, the callback predicates can be arbitrary shell commands using <code>shellcmd/1</code>, even whole commandlines (some examples are included in the <a href="https://github.com/Seeker04/plwm/blob/main/src/config.pl">default config</a>).</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">External bars</h2><a id="user-content-external-bars" aria-label="Permalink: External bars" href="#external-bars"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">First, you must specify <code>bar_class/2</code> based on the WM_CLASS properties of your bars, which you can find out using <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/xprop" rel="nofollow">xprop(1)</a>. Then you can both:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>manually start/close bars while plwm is already running</li>
<li>automatically start bars using <code>hooks/1</code> and its <code>start</code> event in the config</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><code>bar_placement/1</code> can take two values:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>follow_focus</code>: space will be reserved for bars on all monitors and bars will always be moved to the focused monitor (this is the default behavior)</li>
<li><code>static</code>: space will only be reserved for bars in their respective monitors they occupy and no bar will be moved automatically. Placing bars to desired monitors is the responsibility of the user/external bar</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Some bars (e.g., polybar) already support different labels for empty and occupied workspaces. The advantages of plwm's built-in <code>ws_format/1</code> and <code>ws_format_occupied/1</code> are:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>it works on more primitive bars as well</li>
<li>it respects multi-monitor scenarios, i.e., it only considers the set of workspaces that belong to the active monitor - this is relevant only with <code>bar_placement(follow_focus)</code></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">You can toggle your external bars with the following hacks (again, some bars may have their own IPC mechanizm for this, but these are bar agnostic solutions):</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="alt + b -> shellcmd(&quot;pkill polybar || polybar&quot;)"><pre><span>alt</span> + <span>b</span> -&gt; shellcmd(<span>"pkill polybar || polybar"</span>)</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">or if you use multiple bars (a top and a bottom polybar called "top" and "bot", for example), you can:</p>

<p dir="auto">or if you want the ability to separately toggle the bars, use something like:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="alt + b         -> shellcmd(&quot;pkill -fx 'polybar top' || polybar top&quot;),
alt + shift + b -> shellcmd(&quot;pkill -fx 'polybar bot' || polybar bot&quot;)"><pre><span>alt</span> + <span>b</span>         -&gt; shellcmd(<span>"pkill -fx 'polybar top' || polybar top"</span>),
<span>alt</span> + <span>shift</span> + <span>b</span> -&gt; shellcmd(<span>"pkill -fx 'polybar bot' || polybar bot"</span>)</pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note:</strong> if you are using polybar, <strong>do not enable</strong> its <code>override-redirect = true</code> setting (it can even crash plwm in some cases)! Reasoning: plwm itself handles all bars (anything that matches <code>bar_class</code>, not just polybar) the intended way: bars cannot be focused, grabbed, moved or resized; tiling windows will never cover them (but you can drag floating windows above them); fullscreen windows will always cover them.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Multi-monitor</h2><a id="user-content-multi-monitor" aria-label="Permalink: Multi-monitor" href="#multi-monitor"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The multi-monitor concept in plwm is similar to dwm's: the set of workspaces is cloned for each monitor. So if you're using the default config with two monitors, then you'll have two times nine unique workspaces: <code>M1/1</code>, <code>M1/2</code>,..., <code>M2/9</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>switch_monitor/1</code> and <code>move_focused_to_monitor/1</code> predicates can take many different values:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>prev</code>/<code>next</code> will go to the previous/next monitor (these will wrap) - only these have keymaps by default</li>
<li><code>prev_nonempty</code>/<code>next_nonempty</code> will go to the previous/next <em>non-empty</em> monitor (a monitor is considered empty if its currently displayed workspace is empty). If you use a lot of monitors, say six, it could be convenient to cycle through only the relevant, i.e., non-empty ones (these will wrap)</li>
<li><code>left</code>/<code>right</code>/<code>up</code>/<code>down</code> will go to the specified direction relative to the active monitor calculated from x/y screen coordinates (these won't wrap)</li>
<li>An output name, shown by <code>xrandr(1)</code>, e.g. "eDP-1" or "HDMI-1". If you have a consistent <a href="https://man.archlinux.org/man/xrandr.1" rel="nofollow">xrandr(1)</a> setup, then you can refer them to move to arbitrary monitors</li>
<li>Index of managed monitor</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">You can also switch monitors by moving with the mouse between them. Likewise, windows can be dragged and dropped between monitors using the mouse.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Layout overrides</h2><a id="user-content-layout-overrides" aria-label="Permalink: Layout overrides" href="#layout-overrides"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>default_nmaster</code>, <code>default_mfact</code> and <code>default_layout</code> settings can each be overridden for specific monitors and/or workspaces using <code>layout_default_overrides/5</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Underscore at the monitor column means "all monitors" for that workspace, while underscore at the workspace column means "all workspaces" on that monitor.</p>
<p dir="auto">Underscores at the nmaster, mfact and layout columns mean not to alter the default settings for those.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note:</strong> a later override will overrule values of previous ones if there is an overlap.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Rules</h2><a id="user-content-rules" aria-label="Permalink: Rules" href="#rules"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">You can apply custom rules to newly spawned windows that match one or more criteria. You can match the window's name, class and title. These are substring matches by default, but you can wrap them in <code>exact()</code> to force an exact match, or can write any of them as <code>_</code> to ignore those particular checks.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>monitor</code> column takes an output name, or you can leave it as <code>_</code>, which implies opening on the currently active monitor.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>workspace</code> column takes a workspace name (use single quotes), an index (from 1) or you can leave it as <code>_</code>, which implies opening on the currently active workspace.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>mode</code> column can take the following values:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>managed</code>: Window will be managed (<code>_</code> also implies this)</li>
<li><code>floating</code>: Window will be unmanaged, i.e., floating</li>
<li><code>[X, Y, W, H]</code>: Same as <code>floating</code>, but also apply this geometry:
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>X</code> can be <code>left</code>, <code>right</code>, <code>center</code>, an integer coordinate, a percent (0.0..1.0) of x axis</li>
<li><code>Y</code> can be <code>top</code>, <code>bottom</code>, <code>center</code>, an integer coordinate, a percent (0.0..1.0) of y axis</li>
<li><code>W</code> can be an integer size or a percent (0.0..1.0) of screen width</li>
<li><code>H</code> can be an integer size or a percent (0.0..1.0) of screen height</li>
<li>also, any of them can be left as <code>_</code> to keep the value the window spawned with</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>fullscreen</code>: Window will open in fullscreen mode</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note:</strong> if a window matches multiple rules, the first will be applied.</p>
<p dir="auto">Some examples:</p>

])</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">You can find out the <code>name</code>, <code>class</code> and <code>title</code> values of windows using <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/xprop" rel="nofollow">xprop(1)</a>:</p>
<p dir="auto">WM_CLASS(STRING) = name , class<br>
WM_NAME(STRING)  = title</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Tip:</strong> if you want to apply a rule to a terminal application, then you'll need to use a terminal emulator that allows you to predefine the window class or title (most of them do). For example, alacritty has the <code>--class</code> and st has the <code>-c</code> flag for this:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="shellcmd(&quot;alacritty --class cmus -e cmus&quot;)"><pre><span>shellcmd</span>(<span>"alacritty --class cmus -e cmus"</span>)</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">then you can match it with with a rule like:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="(&quot;cmus&quot;, &quot;cmus&quot;, _ -> &quot;eDP-1&quot;, '9', managed)"><pre>("cmus", "cmus", _ -&gt; "eDP-1", '9', managed)</pre></div>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Why workplaces instead of tags?</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Tags is a cool generalization of workspaces, but I never actually utilized them in dwm for more than simple workspace usage. That's why I went with the simpler approach.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>What about performance? Isn't Prolog slow?</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Compared to what? C? Yes. Does it matter? No. I've been using dwm for 6 years, so I have a good idea of its speed, and when I switch to plwm, it feels <strong>exactly</strong> as snappy... on my 10 years old laptop. So I don't think, anyone will see a notable difference.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Isn't SWI-Prolog non-ISO compliant?</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Interoperability between different Prolog implementations was never really on the table. Their C FFIs are also different, so <a href="https://github.com/Seeker04/plwm/blob/main/plx.c">plx.c</a> would also need to be rewritten for each kind of Prolog. SWI-Prolog is arguably one of the most popular free and community-driven Prolog implementations, is easily accessible, has good documentation, some LSP support and a lot of libraries. Though, to be honest, plwm's code mostly sticks to fundamentals, so if someone really wanted to, it shouldn't be too hard to port this to another Prolog system...</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Why not Wayland?</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">A Wayland port some day is not out of the realm of possibilities...</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Some windows display all grey without contents!</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">It is a known issue for Java applications which use the XToolkit/XAWT backend (e.g., UMLet). There is an excerpt from dwm's manual about it in plwm(1). Adding</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="export _JAVA_AWT_WM_NONREPARENTING=1"><pre><span>export</span> _JAVA_AWT_WM_NONREPARENTING=1</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">to your <code>.xinitrc</code> should solve this problem.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>plwm doesn't start! What's going on?</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Most likely your configuration is faulty. Run <code>plwm --check</code>, then you should see the problem.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you don't see a config error, then please report it as an issue. Preferably by attaching any message plwm dumps to stderr or to its logfile with <code>-l</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>How do I debug this?</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">You can use the above mentioned <code>-l</code> flag with <code>writeln/1</code> and <code>format/2</code> calls to dump messages.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can also use the <code>utils:dumpstack/0</code> predicate to manually dump the stack at any given point.</p>
<p dir="auto">For more sophisticated debugging, replace the <code>exec plwm</code> line in your <code>.xinitrc</code> with an <code>exec &lt;terminal-you-use&gt;</code>, then after starting X, run:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="swipl -p foreign=/usr/local/lib src/plwm.pl"><pre>swipl -p foreign=/usr/local/lib src/plwm.pl</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">From the toplevel you can use <code>trace/0</code> or <code>debug/0</code> to start debugging and then <code>main/0</code> to start stepping through plwm. Or use <code>spy/1</code> for placing breakpoints... You can learn more about the interactive debugger starting from <a href="https://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=debugoverview" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you wish to peek into the X11 bindings in plx.c, then you can add <code>-g</code> to <code>CFLAGS</code> in the Makefile, recompile, then use <code>attach &lt;PID&gt;</code> in <code>gdb</code> as root.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Something is missing...</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">plwm is minimal in the sense that it doesn't try to solve problems outside of a window manager's domain, especially if they are easily served by other programs (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy" rel="nofollow">here</a>):</p>

<h2>Noam Chomsky Interviewed by C.J. Polychroniou</h2>
<h3>May 3, 2023.&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.commondreams.org/opinion/noam-chomsky-on-chatgpt">Common Dreams.</a></em></h3>


<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is sweeping the world. It is transforming every walk of life and raising in the process major ethical concerns for society and the future of humanity. ChatGPT, which is dominating social media, is an AI-powered chatbot developed by OpenAI. It is a subset of machine learning and relies on what is called Large Language Models that can generate human-like responses. The potential application for such technology is indeed enormous, which is why there are already calls to regulate AI like ChatGPT.</p>



<p>Can AI outsmart humans? Does it pose public threats? Indeed, can AI become an existential threat? The world’s preeminent linguist&nbsp;<a href="https://www.commondreams.org/author/noam-chomsky">Noam Chomsky</a>, and one of the most esteemed public intellectuals of all time, whose intellectual stature has been compared to that of Galileo, Newton, and Descartes, tackles these nagging questions in the interview that follows.</p>



<p><strong>C. J. Polychroniou</strong>: As a scientific discipline, artificial intelligence (AI) dates back to the 1950s, but over the last couple of decades it has been making inroads into all sort of fields, including banking, insurance, auto manufacturing, music, and defense. In fact, the use of AI techniques has been shown in some instance to surpass human capabilities, such as in a game of chess. Are machines likely to become smarter than humans?</p>



<p><strong>Noam Chomsky</strong>: Just to clarify terminology, the term “machine” here means&nbsp;<em>program</em>, basically a theory written in a notation that can be executed by a computer–and an unusual kind of theory in interesting ways that we can put aside here.</p>



<p>We can make a rough distinction between pure engineering and science. There is no sharp boundary, but it’s a useful first approximation. Pure engineering seeks to produce a product that may be of some use. Science seeks understanding. If the topic is human intelligence, or cognitive capacities of other organisms, science seeks understanding of these biological systems.</p>



<p>As I understand them, the founders of AI–Alan Turing, Herbert Simon, Marvin Minsky, and others–regarded it as science, part of the then-emerging cognitive sciences, making use of new technologies and discoveries in the mathematical theory of computation to advance understanding. Over the years those concerns have faded and have largely been displaced by an engineering orientation. The earlier concerns are now commonly dismissed, sometimes condescendingly, as GOFAI–good old-fashioned AI.</p>



<p>Continuing with the question, is it likely that programs will be devised that surpass human capabilities? We have to be careful about the word “capabilities,” for reasons to which I’ll return. But if we take the term to refer to human performance, then the answer is: definitely yes. In fact, they have long existed: the calculator in a laptop, for example. It can far exceed what humans can do, if only because of lack of time and memory. For closed systems like chess, it was well understood in the ‘50s that sooner or later, with the advance of massive computing capacities and a long period of preparation, a program could be devised to defeat a grandmaster who is playing with a bound on memory and time. The achievement years later was pretty much PR for IBM. Many biological organisms surpass human cognitive capacities in much deeper ways. The desert ants in my backyard have minuscule brains, but far exceed human navigational capacities, in principle, not just performance. There is no Great Chain of Being with humans at the top.</p>



<p>The products of AI engineering are being used in many fields, for better or for worse. Even simple and familiar ones can be quite useful: in the language area, programs like autofill, live transcription, google translate, among others. With vastly greater computing power and more sophisticated programming, there should be other useful applications, in the sciences as well. There already have been some: Assisting in the study of protein folding is one recent case where massive and rapid search technology has helped scientists to deal with a critical and recalcitrant problem.</p>



<p>Engineering projects can be useful, or harmful. Both questions arise in the case of engineering AI. Current work with Large Language Models (LLMs), including chatbots, provides tools for disinformation, defamation, and misleading the uninformed. The threats are enhanced when they are combined with artificial images and replication of voice. With different concerns in mind, tens of thousands of AI researchers have recently&nbsp;<a href="https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">called</a>&nbsp;for a moratorium on development because of potential dangers they perceive.</p>



<p>As always, possible benefits of technology have to be weighed against potential costs.</p>



<p>Quite different questions arise when we turn to AI and science. Here caution is necessary because of exorbitant and reckless claims, often amplified in the media. To clarify the issues, let’s consider cases, some hypothetical, some real.</p>



<p>I mentioned insect navigation, which is an astonishing achievement. Insect scientists have made much progress in studying how it is achieved, though the neurophysiology, a very difficult matter, remains elusive, along with evolution of the systems. The same is true of the amazing feats of birds and sea turtles that travel thousands of miles and unerringly return to the place of origin.</p>



<p>Suppose Tom Jones, a proponent of engineering AI, comes along and says: “Your work has all been refuted. The problem is solved. Commercial airline pilots achieve the same or even better results all the time.”</p>



<p>If even bothering to respond, we’d laugh.</p>



<p>Take the case of the seafaring exploits of Polynesians, still alive among Indigenous tribes, using stars, wind, currents to land their canoes at a designated spot hundreds of miles away. This too has been the topic of much research to find out how they do it. Tom Jones has the answer: “Stop wasting your time; naval vessels do it all the time.”</p>



<p>Same response.</p>



<p>Let’s now turn to a real case, language acquisition. It’s been the topic of extensive and highly illuminating research in recent years, showing that infants have very rich knowledge of the ambient language (or languages), far beyond what they exhibit in performance. It is achieved with little evidence, and in some crucial cases none at all. At best, as careful statistical studies have shown, available data are sparse, particularly when rank-frequency (“Zipf’s law”) is taken into account.</p>



<p>Enter Tom Jones: “You’ve been refuted. Paying no attention to your discoveries, LLMs that scan astronomical amounts of data can find statistical regularities that make it possible to simulate the data on which they are trained, producing something that looks pretty much like normal human behavior. Chatbots.”</p>



<p>This case differs from the others. First, it is real. Second, people don’t laugh; in fact, many are awed. Third, unlike the hypothetical cases, the actual results are far from what’s claimed.</p>



<p>These considerations bring up a minor problem with the current LLM enthusiasm: its total absurdity, as in the hypothetical cases where we recognize it at once. But there are much more serious problems than absurdity.</p>



<p>One is that the LLM systems are designed in such a way that they cannot tell us anything about language, learning, or other aspects of cognition, a matter of principle, irremediable. Double the terabytes of data scanned, add another trillion parameters, use even more of California’s energy, and the simulation of behavior will improve, while revealing more clearly the failure in principle of the approach to yield any understanding. The reason is elementary: The systems work just as well with impossible languages that infants cannot acquire as with those they acquire quickly and virtually reflexively.</p>



<p>It’s as if a biologist were to say: “I have a great new theory of organisms. It lists many that exist and many that can’t possibly exist, and I can tell you nothing about the distinction.”</p>



<p>Again, we’d laugh. Or should.</p>



<p>Not Tom Jones–now referring to actual cases. Persisting in his radical departure from science, Tom Jones responds: “How do you know any of this until you’ve investigated all languages?” At this point the abandonment of normal science becomes even clearer. By parity of argument, we can throw out genetics and molecular biology, the theory of evolution, and the rest of the biological sciences, which haven’t sampled more than a tiny fraction of organisms. And for good measure, we can cast out all of physics. Why believe in the laws of motion? How many objects have actually been observed in motion?</p>



<p>There is, furthermore, the small matter of burden of proof. Those who propose a theory have the responsibility of showing that it makes some sense, in this case, showing that it fails for impossible languages. It is not the responsibility of others to refute the proposal, though in this case it seems easy enough to do so.</p>



<p>Let’s shift attention to normal science, where matters become interesting. Even a single example of language acquisition can yield rich insight into the distinction between possible and impossible languages.</p>



<p>The reasons are straightforward, and familiar. All growth and development, including what is called “learning,” is a process that begins with a state of the organism and transforms it step-by-step to later stages.</p>



<p>Acquisition of language is such a process. The initial state is the biological endowment of the faculty of language, which obviously exists, even if it is, as some believe, a particular combination of other capacities. That’s highly unlikely for reasons long understood, but it’s not relevant to our concerns here, so we can put it aside. Plainly there is a biological endowment for the human faculty of language. The merest truism.</p>



<p>Transition proceeds to a relatively stable state, changed only superficially beyond: knowledge of the language. External data trigger and partially shape the process. Studying the state attained (knowledge of the language) and the external data, we can draw far-reaching conclusions about the initial state, the biological endowment that makes language acquisition possible. The conclusions about the initial state impose a distinction between possible and impossible languages. The distinction holds for all those who share the initial state–all humans, as far as is known; there seems to be no difference in capacity to acquire language among existing human groups.</p>



<p>All of this is normal science, and it has achieved many results.</p>



<p>Experiment has shown that the stable state is substantially obtained very early, by three to four years of age. It’s also well-established that the faculty of language has basic properties specific to humans, hence that it is a true species property: common to human groups and in fundamental ways a unique human attribute.</p>



<p>A lot is left out in this schematic account, notably the role of natural law in growth and development: in the case of a computational system like language, principles of computational efficiency. But this is the essence of the matter. Again, normal science.</p>



<p>It is important to be clear about Aristotle’s distinction between possession of knowledge and use of knowledge (in contemporary terminology, competence and performance). In the language case, the stable state obtained is possession of knowledge, coded in the brain. The internal system determines an unbounded array of structured expressions, each of which we can regard as formulating a thought, each externalizable in some sensorimotor system, usually sound though it could be sign or even (with difficulty) touch.</p>



<p>The internally coded system is accessed in use of knowledge (performance). Performance includes the internal use of language in thought: reflection, planning, recollection, and a great deal more. Statistically speaking that is by far the overwhelming use of language. It is inaccessible to introspection, though we can learn a lot about it by the normal methods of science, from “outside,” metaphorically speaking. What is called “inner speech” is, in fact, fragments of externalized language with the articulatory apparatus muted. It is only a remote reflection of the internal use of language, important matters I cannot pursue here.</p>



<p>Other forms of use of language are perception (parsing) and production, the latter crucially involving properties that remain as mysterious to us today as when they were regarded with awe and amazement by Galileo and his contemporaries at the dawn of modern science.</p>



<p>The principal goal of science is to discover the internal system, both in its initial state in the human faculty of language and in the particular forms it assumes in acquisition. To the extent that this internal system is understood, we can proceed to investigate how it enters into performance, interacting with many other factors that enter into use of language.</p>



<p>Data of performance provide evidence about the nature of the internal system, particularly so when they are refined by experiment, as in standard field work. But even the most massive collection of data is necessarily misleading in crucial ways. It keeps to what is normally produced, not the knowledge of the language coded in the brain, the primary object under investigation for those who want to understand the nature of language and its use. That internal object determines infinitely many possibilities of a kind that will not be used in normal behavior because of factors irrelevant to language, like short-term memory constraints, topics studied 60 years ago. Observed data will also include much that lies outside the system coded in the brain, often conscious use of language in ways that violate the rules for rhetorical purposes. These are truisms known to all field workers, who rely on elicitation techniques with informants, basically experiments, to yield a refined corpus that excludes irrelevant restrictions and deviant expressions. The same is true when linguists use themselves as informants, a perfectly sensible and normal procedure, common in the history of psychology up to the present.</p>



<p>Proceeding further with normal science, we find that the internal processes and elements of the language cannot be detected by inspection of observed phenomena. Often these elements do not even appear in speech (or writing), though their effects, often subtle, can be detected. That is yet another reason why restriction to observed phenomena, as in LLM approaches, sharply limits understanding of the internal processes that are the core objects of inquiry into the nature of language, its acquisition and use. But that is not relevant if concern for science and understanding have been abandoned in favor of other goals.</p>



<p>More generally in the sciences, for millennia, conclusions have been reached by experiments–often thought experiments–each a radical abstraction from phenomena. Experiments are theory-driven, seeking to discard the innumerable irrelevant factors that enter into observed phenomena–like linguistic performance. All of this is so elementary that it’s rarely even discussed. And familiar. As noted, the basic distinction goes back to Aristotle’s distinction between possession of knowledge and use of knowledge. The former is the central object of study. Secondary (and quite serious) studies investigate how the internally stored system of knowledge is used in performance, along with the many non-linguistic factors than enter into what is directly observed.</p>



<p>We might also recall an observation of evolutionary biologist Theodosius Dobzhansky, famous primarily for his work with Drosophila: Each species is unique, and humans are the uniquest of all. If we are interested in understanding what kind of creatures we are–following the injunction of the Delphic Oracle 2,500 years ago–we will be primarily concerned with what makes humans the uniquest of all, primarily language and thought, closely intertwined, as recognized in a rich tradition going back to classical Greece and India. Most behavior is fairly routine, hence to some extent predictable. What provides real insight into what makes us unique is what is not routine, which we do find, sometimes by experiment, sometimes by observation, from normal children to great artists and scientists.</p>



<p>One final comment in this connection. Society has been plagued for a century by massive corporate campaigns to encourage disdain for science, topics well studied by Naomi Oreskes among others. It began with corporations whose products are murderous: lead, tobacco, asbestos, later fossil fuels. Their motives are understandable. The goal of a business in a capitalist society is profit, not human welfare. That’s an institutional fact: Don’t play the game and you’re out, replaced by someone who will.</p>



<p>The corporate PR departments recognized early on that it would be a mistake to deny the mounting scientific evidence of the lethal effects of their products. That would be easily refuted. Better to sow doubt, encourage uncertainty, contempt for these pointy-headed suits who have never painted a house but come down from Washington to tell me not to use lead paint, destroying my business (a real case, easily multiplied). That has worked all too well. Right now it is leading us on a path to destruction of organized human life on earth.</p>



<p>In intellectual circles, similar effects have been produced by the postmodern critique of science,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fashionable-Nonsense-Postmodern-Intellectuals-Science/dp/0312204078" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dismantled</a>&nbsp;by Jean Bricmont and Alan Sokal, but still much alive in some circles.</p>



<p>It may be unkind to suggest the question, but it is, I think, fair to ask whether the Tom Joneses and those who uncritically repeat and even amplify their careless proclamations are contributing to the same baleful tendencies.</p>



<p><strong>CJP</strong>: ChatGPT is a natural-language-driven chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to allow human-like conversations. In a recent article in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/08/opinion/noam-chomsky-chatgpt-ai.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The New York Times</em></a>, in conjunction with two other authors, you shut down the new chatbots as a hype because they simply cannot match the linguistic competence of humans. Isn’t it however possible that future innovations in AI can produce engineering projects that will match and perhaps even surpass human capabilities?</p>



<p><strong>NC</strong>: Credit for the article should be given to the actual author, Jeffrey Watumull, a fine mathematician-linguist-philosopher. The two listed co-authors were consultants, who agree with the article but did not write it.</p>



<p>It’s true that chatbots cannot in principle match the linguistic competence of humans, for the reasons repeated above. Their basic design prevents them from reaching the minimal condition of adequacy for a theory of human language: distinguishing possible from impossible languages. Since that is a property of the design, it cannot be overcome by future innovations in this kind of AI. However, it is quite possible that future engineering projects will match and even surpass human capabilities, if we mean human capacity to act, performance. As mentioned above, some have long done so: automatic calculators for example. More interestingly, as mentioned, insects with minuscule brains surpass human capacities understood as competence.</p>



<p><strong>CJP</strong>: In the aforementioned article, it was also observed that today’s AI projects do not possess a human moral faculty. Does this obvious fact make AI robots less of a threat to the human race? I reckon the argument can be that it makes them perhaps even more so.</p>



<p><strong>NC</strong>: It is indeed an obvious fact, understanding “moral faculty” broadly. Unless carefully controlled, AI engineering can pose severe threats. Suppose, for example, that care of patients was automated. The inevitable errors that would be overcome by human judgment could produce a horror story. Or suppose that humans were removed from evaluation of the threats determined by automated missile-defense systems. As a shocking historical record&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2017-10/news-briefs/man-saved-world-dies-77" target="_blank">informs</a>&nbsp;us, that would be the end of human civilization.</p>



<p><strong>CJP</strong>: Regulators and law enforcement agencies in Europe are raising concerns about the spread of ChatGPT while a recently submitted piece of European Union legislation is trying to deal with AI by classifying such tools according to their perceived level of risk. Do you agree with those who are concerned that ChatGPT poses a serious public threat? Moreover, do you really think that the further development of AI tools can be halted until safeguards can be introduced?</p>



<p><strong>NC</strong>: I can easily sympathize with efforts to try to control the threats posed by advanced technology, including this case. I am, however, skeptical about the possibility of doing so. I suspect that the genie is out of the bottle. Malicious actors–institutional or individual–can probably find ways to evade safeguards. Such suspicions are of course no reason not to try, and to exercise vigilance.</p>

<p dir="auto">The OSSU curriculum is a <strong>complete education in computer science</strong> using online materials.
It's not merely for career training or professional development.
It's for those who want a proper, <em>well-rounded</em> grounding in concepts fundamental to all computing disciplines,
and for those who have the discipline, will, and (most importantly!) good habits to obtain this education largely on their own,
but with support from a worldwide community of fellow learners.</p>
<p dir="auto">It is designed according to the degree requirements of undergraduate computer science majors, minus general education (non-CS) requirements,
as it is assumed most of the people following this curriculum are already educated outside the field of CS.
The courses themselves are among the very best in the world, often coming from Harvard, Princeton, MIT, etc.,
but specifically chosen to meet the following criteria.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Courses must</strong>:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Be open for enrollment</li>
<li>Run regularly (ideally in self-paced format, otherwise running multiple times per year)</li>
<li>Be of generally high quality in teaching materials and pedagogical principles</li>
<li>Match the curricular standards of the <a href="https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/blob/master/CURRICULAR_GUIDELINES.md">CS 2013</a>: Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Degree Programs in Computer Science</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">When no course meets the above criteria, the coursework is supplemented with a book.
When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality,
they belong in <a href="https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/blob/master/extras/courses.md">extras/courses</a> or <a href="https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/blob/master/extras/readings.md">extras/readings</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Organization</strong>. The curriculum is designed as follows:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><em>Intro CS</em>: for students to try out CS and see if it's right for them</li>
<li><em>Core CS</em>: corresponds roughly to the first three years of a computer science curriculum, taking classes that all majors would be required to take</li>
<li><em>Advanced CS</em>: corresponds roughly to the final year of a computer science curriculum, taking electives according to the student's interests</li>
<li><em>Final Project</em>: a project for students to validate, consolidate, and display their knowledge, to be evaluated by their peers worldwide</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Duration</strong>. It is possible to finish within about 2 years if you plan carefully and devote roughly 20 hours/week to your studies. Learners can use <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/3/d/1Std_G_5dnajzm289vlsthIJPFnuxN5yOYNDOoiz9Juc/copy" rel="nofollow">this spreadsheet</a> to estimate their end date. Make a copy and input your start date and expected hours per week in the <code>Timeline</code> sheet. As you work through courses you can enter your actual course completion dates in the <code>Curriculum Data</code> sheet and get updated completion estimates.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Warning:</strong> While the spreadsheet is a useful tool to estimate the time you need to complete this curriculum, it may not always be up-to-date with the curriculum. Use the <a href="https://cs.ossu.dev/" rel="nofollow">OSSU CS website</a> or <a href="https://github.com/ossu/computer-science">the repo</a> to see what courses to do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Cost</strong>. All or nearly all course material is available for free. However, some courses may charge money for assignments/tests/projects to be graded.
Note that both <a href="https://www.coursera.support/s/article/209819033-Apply-for-Financial-Aid-or-a-Scholarship?language=en_US" rel="nofollow">Coursera</a> and <a href="https://courses.edx.org/financial-assistance/" rel="nofollow">edX</a> offer financial aid.</p>
<p dir="auto">Decide how much or how little to spend based on your own time and budget;
just remember that you can't purchase success!</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Process</strong>. Students can work through the curriculum alone or in groups, in order or out of order.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>We recommend doing all courses in Core CS, only skipping a course when you are certain that you've already learned the material previously.</li>
<li>For simplicity, we recommend working through courses (especially Core CS) in order from top to bottom. Some students choose to study multiple courses at a time in order to vary the material they are working on in a day/week. A popular option is to take the math courses in parallel with the introductory courses. Course prerequisites are listed to help you determine if you are prepared for a given course.</li>
<li>Courses in Advanced CS are electives. Choose one subject (e.g. Advanced programming) you want to become an expert in and take all the courses under that heading. You can also create your own custom subject; the Discord community may provide feedback on your planned subject.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Content policy</strong>. If you plan on showing off some of your coursework publicly, you must share only files that you are allowed to.
<em>Respect the code of conduct</em> that you signed in the beginning of each course!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>There are too many planes in the sky. In 2024, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) supervised nearly <a href="https://medium.com/faa/2024-by-the-numbers-one-of-the-busiest-years-for-flights-adce7871d211">16.8 million</a> flights in American airspace — half a million more than the year prior. To manage all of those airplanes, however, the FAA uses an air traffic control system <a href="https://www.oig.dot.gov/sites/default/files/av1998012.pdf">designed in the early 1990s</a> — when features like trackballs and color monitors were new, and air traffic controllers handled less than <a href="https://airlines.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/1999.pdf">half as many flights every year</a>. </p><div><p>Like many government agencies, the FAA has faced <a href="https://transportation.house.gov/uploadedfiles/03-04-2025_aviation_hearing_-_heather_krause_-_testimony.pdf">chronic budget constraints and poor oversight</a> in the ensuing two decades. Not only is its system functionally obsolete; it’s also badly understaffed. Too often, the agency must scramble to find the least-bad solution for its mounting problems — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/planes/617438/plane-crash-air-safety-faa-layoffs">and not all of these solutions are good or even safe</a>.</p></div><p>One such scenario has been unfolding at Newark Liberty International Airport for the last year.

Around 1:27PM, pilots abruptly lost contact with the controllers that oversee the airport’s approach and departure airspace, known as Newark Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON). </p><p>“<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Eaz_ic5ZVQ&amp;t=92s">Can you hear us</a>?” asked one United pilot. After a beat of silence, another pilot keyed the radio. “Hey Approach, are you there?” A third chimed in, his call sign more of a question. “Austrian eight-niner?”</p><p>Several more seconds passed before Newark TRACON came back on the air.</p><p>“United 1951, how do you hear me?”</p><p>“Loud and clear now,” the first pilot replied.</p><div><p>“Hey Approach, are you there?”</p></div><p>For the moment, normal operations resumed — though controllers were worried about the possibility of another outage. “Upjet 905, join the final approach course,” said one controller, then prudently added, “if you don’t hear me, you can continue on the approach.”</p><p>Seconds later, every radar screen at Newark approach went dark.</p><p>Suddenly blind and unsure if they could even maintain comms with pilots, Newark’s controllers did what they were trained to do — get everyone to a safe holding place until the situation stabilized. To one United pilot in final descent: “stay on the arrival and maintain 6000.” </p><p>To a private pilot, also preparing to land: “climb and maintain 4500.” They diverted another private pilot off to a nearby small airport: “Continue on towards Caldwell, call Caldwell Tower 119.8.” And they told a fourth private pilot passing that it was now up to him to maintain visual separation from other aircraft: “we’re just gonna have to cut you loose.”</p><div><p id="disruption-is-significant"><h2>‘Disruption is significant’</h2></p></div><p>Air traffic controllers prepare for such contingencies, according to Dr. Hassan Shahidi, the president and CEO of the nonprofit FlightSafety Foundation. </p><p>“Emergency traffic is prioritized,” he said. “Flights may be held on the ground. Nearby centers may take over some services.”</p><p>Even in the best-case scenarios, however, “disruption is significant.” </p><p>Controllers at Newark only lost radio and radar for about a minute and a half until backup systems kicked in. And no airplanes crashed or even had a near miss. But it took the rest of the afternoon just to get operations restarted. No one took off again until <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/ground-stop-newark-airport-lifted-142832437.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAADGsYu7jfWFcLvHDR_nG-iNNaCBPceaxmBPj5nKfrEB1jAo-gailsKgyFbeXBrZOOBY51-sfypvzQmTe_gU3CnrOPKDA29EIh8MTQL-xc9kdGWJGwUy2__GzWvp9D6Lx1pPGgxwPnx4xWVndY4XdXGygDMZ0ui_vEdEm2UgVkIfr">5PM</a>, more than three hours later. At least a dozen flights were canceled, and 30 others were diverted to nearby airports. Higher-than-normal delays persisted for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/05/08/nyregion/newark-airport-delays.html">more than a week after the outage</a> as airlines dealt with planes and crews that were out of position. </p><p>Another outage occurred a week and a half later on May 9th. At 3:55AM, radar displays went out <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/faa-hit-by-new-90-second-communications-outage-newark-air-traffic-2025-05-09/">twice</a>.</p><p>“<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1r8HFDZC3I&amp;t=108s">Imma hand you off here, our scopes just went black again</a>,” said one of the controllers as she passed one flight over to JFK and LaGuardia controllers, who still had radar. “If you care about this, contact your airline and try to get some pressure on them to fix this stuff.”</p><div><p>“Imma hand you off here, our scopes just went black again.”</p></div><p>She was right to be exasperated. This was the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/airlines/faa-air-traffic-congestion-new-york-4b3effb9">sixth time</a> <a href="https://theaircurrent.com/aviation-safety/faa-knew-of-potential-for-radar-issues-before-labor-day-newark-failures/">in only</a> <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/11/us-news/flights-delayed-at-newark-airport-over-mysterious-equipment-outage-and-possible-hurricane-chaos/">nine months</a> that Newark TRACON had lost radio and/or radar.

Controllers in this sector manage more than <a href="https://www.natca.org/2016/05/26/april-25-2014-facility-spotlight-new-york-tracon-n90/">6,000 flights per day</a> between the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_in_the_New_York_metropolitan_area#Major_commercial_airports">30-plus</a> airports, heliports, and seaplane bases in the area. And almost a quarter of that volume is handled by Newark TRACON.</p><p>Those controllers aren’t actually located at the airport. Beginning in 1978, the FAA centralized approach and departure traffic for every airport in the greater New York City area into the N90 “super facility” in Westbury, Long Island. N90 was and still is one of the largest TRACON control facilities in the country, with <a href="https://www.natca.org/2016/05/26/april-25-2014-facility-spotlight-new-york-tracon-n90/">200 controllers on staff</a>. Their colocation, along with a direct feed into the FAA’s radar, satellite, and flight data system called STARS, makes operations more efficient and emergencies easier to handle. (For example, close coordination between N90 controllers helped guide the “<a href="https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/accidentreports/reports/aar1003.pdf">Miracle on the Hudson</a>” flight to a safe landing.)</p><p>But since the late ’70s, the job has gotten harder. In 1980, N90 handled an average of <a href="https://airlines.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/1981.pdf">2,200 flights per day</a>. Last year, the number was 3,400. But pay has failed to keep pace both with the increasing complexity of the job, and the <a href="https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CUURS12ASA0?amp%253bdata_tool=XGtable&amp;output_view=data&amp;include_graphs=true">ever-growing cost of living </a>in New York. In 1978, the median wage for an air traffic controller was around <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1978/06/24/archives/air-controllers-end-slowdown-air-controllers-end-1month-slowdown.html">$33,000 a year</a>. In the intervening decades, air traffic wages have increased fourfold, to <a href="https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/2025/05/07/air-traffic-controller-how-much-does-it-pay-job-requirements/83496547007/">$127,000 a year</a>. But the cost of living in the area has increased even faster, <a href="https://data.bls.gov/pdq/SurveyOutputServlet">by more than five times</a>, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p><p>It’s a vicious cycle. Low pay relative to cost of living means that N90 can’t keep people the way that facilities in Dallas or Denver can. And retention problems at N90 have led to <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-118hhrg54742/pdf/CHRG-118hhrg54742.pdf">mandatory overtime</a> and six-day workweeks, further increasing burnout and losses. For the last five years, the FAA has attempted to solve N90’s “<a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/controller_staffing/media/2018-ABA-200-CWP_2019_Report_508.pdf">specific recruiting challenges</a>.” But it failed. </p><p>By the summer of 2023, N90 could muster only two-thirds of its target of <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/cost-of-living-calculator/compare/nassau-county-ny-vs-denver-co">300 controllers</a>. The <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/critical-us-air-traffic-controller-facilities-face-staffing-shortages-audit-2023-06-23/">Newark sector</a> was down to half strength. (Other facilities in lower-cost cities such as Dallas or Denver are closer to 80 percent). Delays were inevitable; in the middle of peak travel season, one out of every three flights out of Newark was delayed by an hour or more. </p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><div

Raytheon</cite></span></p></section><div><p id="making-things-worse"><h2>Making things worse</h2></p></div><p>By 2024, the FAA decided that more drastic action was needed. <a href="https://www.natca.org/2024/07/23/natcas-official-statement-on-mandatory-relocation-of-air-traffic-controllers-from-new-york-to-philadelphia/">It gave up on N90</a> and decided to move Newark TRACON operations into the better-staffed Philadelphia facility. In a vacuum, it might have seemed like a decent tradeoff: disrupt the lives of a few controllers in order to reduce disruptions for thousands of flights and millions of passengers every year. But the FAA made an already marginal decision even worse. </p><p>First, the majority of Newark’s controllers refused to make the move at all. Eventually, the FAA authorized relocation bonuses of up to $100,000. Even then, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/14/us/politics/air-traffic-controllers-job-relocation.html">only 17 of the original 33 controllers agreed to move from N90</a>. Reassignments brought the total up to 24, still short of the pre-move totals — and far short of the <a href="https://theaircurrent.com/air-traffic-control/newark-new-york-atc-n90-natca-faa-cutover/">63-person target</a>. </p><p>Second, the FAA failed to invest in the data infrastructure required to support remote operations. To save money, the FAA elected <a href="https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/faa-statements-newark-liberty-international-airport">not to build a new STARS server in Philadelphia</a> to support the move. <a href="https://www.oig.dot.gov/sites/default/files/FAA%20Terminal%20Modernization%20%28STARS%29%20Final%20Report.pdf">A new server alone</a> would require tens of millions of dollars, as well as installation of new internet and power infrastructure. Instead, it elected to send a “mirror feed” of telemetry from the STARS servers at N90, traveling over 130 miles of commercial copper telecom lines, with fiber optics to follow <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fabout%2Fnews%2Fverizon-public-sector-wins-federal-aviation-administration-fens-contract" rel="sponsored">by 2030</a>.</p><p>The annoyances of traditional cable internet — frequent lag, dropped sessions — are probably familiar to those who stream video or play games online. But for air traffic controllers, even the smallest service disruptions can become dangerous. </p><div><p>Especially when combined with the FAA’s already dire infrastructure. Every week, the air traffic control system in the United States suffers around <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/airlines/air-traffic-control-fix-problems-2bffc11c">700 outages</a>. Its systems are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120930072126/http://www.raytheon.com/capabilities/products/stellent/groups/public/documents/content/cms01_052837.pdf">decades old</a>, and are often <a href="https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/brand-new-air-traffic-control-system-plan">held together with improvised fixes</a> — daisy-chained power strips, cables protected only by aluminum foil, old radar systems being cooled by tabletop fans. And in February, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/614078/faa-air-traffic-control-spacex-elon-musk-layoff-staff-shortage">at the direction of Elon Musk’s DOGE</a>, the FAA laid off more than 100 workers, including the <a href="https://theaircurrent.com/aviation-safety/doge-layoffs-faa-safety-critical-roles-scrutiny/">maintenance technicians and telecommunications specialists</a> needed to keep unreliable systems in working order.</p></div><p>The FAA’s own analysis downplayed these risks, however. According to an <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/09/us/newark-delays-air-traffic-control-safety-invs">internal study obtained by CNN</a>, experts calculated that the risk of a critical failure for Newark’s remote feeds were one in 11 million, or a roughly “seven-nines” reliability standard that allowed only three seconds of downtime in a given year. It’s not clear how the agency calculated this figure. And FAA standards only require a “<a href="https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/air_traffic/technology/cinp/fens/nas_overview_2015-09-02.pdf">five-nines</a>” standard, which allows up to five minutes of downtime in any given year. This math removed the last remaining impediment to the move. </p><p>As of this writing, the remote data feeds into Newark TRACON have been down for around 10 minutes over the course of 10 months — nearly two and a half times beyond the “five-nines” standard, and 200 times beyond the “seven-nines” estimate from its report. </p><div><p id="a-knifes-edge"><h2>A knife’s edge</h2></p></div><p>It’s easy to state the obvious. The FAA should plan better. It should raise salaries and hire more people. It should replace old tech with new. (The agency did not respond to multiple requests for comment.)</p><p>Such glib solutioning ignores the agency’s intractable problems of time and money. It hired 1,500 new air traffic controllers last year and will hire 2,000 more this year, but many of them won’t be fully certified until 2026 at the earliest. It contracted with Verizon to build new fiber-optic links between FAA facilities, but many of these won’t come online for up to a decade. And its implementation of a “NextGen” air traffic control system to replace the current version <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-25-108162.pdf">may not be completed until 2034, even though the project was started in 2003.</a></p><div><p>It still isn’t enough to overcome decades of underinvestment</p></div><p>Although the agency’s budget has grown 50 percent over the last decade to $24 billion, it still isn’t enough to overcome decades of underinvestment. Last year, the FAA had to stretch a <a href="https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/2024-03/FAA_FY_2025_Budget_Request_508-v5.pdf">$1.7 billion</a> maintenance budget to cover nearly <a href="https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/2024-03/FAA_FY_2025_Budget_Request_508-v5.pdf">$5.2 billion in outstanding repairs</a> at air traffic control facilities. It had to spend nearly $532 million of its 2025 budget a year early to cover “uncontrollable employee compensation costs” such as mandatory overtime and the “surge” in hiring for new air traffic controllers. </p><div><p>Meanwhile, DOGE consultants have focused on <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-musk-doge-faa-nda-secret-project-lift-1235325667/">finding money for new Starlink contracts</a> and <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/faa-workers-threatened-firing-spacex-b2709799.html">reducing oversight of SpaceX</a> at the FAA. Cronyism, it turns out, has little impact on (or interest in) the government’s most difficult challenges. </p></div><p>Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has promised us “<a href="https://x.com/SecDuffy/status/1891310401800872114">safe, state-of-the-art air travel</a>,” but the FAA’s history (and the largely detail-free, eight-page “<a href="https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/2025-05/Brand%20New%20Air%20Traffic%20Control%20System%20Plan.pdf">Brand New Air Traffic Control Plan</a>”) suggest that it will be a long time coming. While we wait, we can at least console ourselves that air traffic controllers have learned how to give us safe air travel in the absence of state-of-the-art air travel. </p><p>Still, the entire system rests on a knife’s edge between safe operations and potential disaster. The smallest disruption can throw the entire system into chaos — putting thousands of lives, billions of dollars, and the reputation of American aviation as the safest in the world in harm’s way.</p></div></div>]]></description>

  <article>
    <p>“Why would you ever want to write a program that changes its code while it’s running? That’s a horrible idea!”</p>

<p>Yes, yes it is. It’s a good learning experience though. This is not something you would ever do outside of exploring a curiosity.</p>

<p>Self-mutating/self-modifying programs aren’t useful for a whole lot. They make for difficult debugging, the program becomes hardware dependent, and the code is extremely tedious and confusing to read unless you are an expert assembly programmer. The only good use for self-mutating programs in the wild I know of is as a cloaking mechanism for malware. My goal is purely academic so I venture into nothing of the sort here.</p>

<p><strong>Warning: This post is heavy on x86_64 assembly of which I am no expert. A fair amount of research went into writing this and it’s possible (almost expected) that mistakes were made. If you find one, send an email so that it may be corrected.</strong></p>

<p>The first step of writing a self-mutating program is being able to change the code at runtime. Programmers figured out long ago that this was a bad idea and since then protections have been added to prevent a program’s code from being changed at runtime. We first need to understand where the program’s instructions live when the program is being executed. When a program is to be executed, the loader will load the entire program into memory. The program then executes inside of a virtual address space that is managed by the kernel. This address space is broken up into different segments as illustrated below.</p>

<p><img src="https://ephemeral.cx/assets/images/2013/12/address_space.png" alt=""></p>

<p>In this case, we’re only concerned with the text segment. This is where the instructions of the process are stored. Behind the address space are pages which are handled by the kernel. These pages map to the physical memory of the computer. The kernel controls permissions to each of these pages. By default, the text segment pages are set to read and execute. You may not write to them. In order to change the instructions at runtime, we’ll need to change the permissions of the text segment pages so that we write to them.</p>

<p>Changing the permissions of a page can be done with the <code>mprotect()</code> function. The only tricky part of <code>mprotect()</code> is that the pointer you give it must be aligned to a page boundary. Here is a function that given a pointer, moves the pointer to the page boundary and then changes that page to read, write, and execute permissions.</p>

    <span>}</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></figure>

<!--more-->

<p>If we give this function a pointer that points to an address in the text segment, that page in the text segment will now be writeable. It is important to note that the OS may refuse to allow the text segment to be writeable. I’m working on Linux, which does allow for writing to the text segment. If you are using another OS, make sure you’re checking the return value to see if the call to <code>mprotect()</code> failed. In the examples below, we assume that the function we’ll be changing is contained entirely on a single page. For long functions, this may not be the case.</p>

<hr>

<p>Now that we can write to the text segment, the next question is: what do we write?</p>

<p>Let’s start with something simple. Say I have the following function:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
</pre></td><td><pre><span>void</span> <span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>i</span><span>=</span><span>0</span><span>;</span>
    <span>i</span><span>++</span><span>;</span>
    <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"i: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>i</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></figure>

<p><code>foo()</code> creates and initializes a local variable, <code>i</code>, to 0, then increments it by 1 and prints it to stdout. Let’s see if we can change the value that <code>i</code> is incremented by.</p>

<p>To accomplish this goal, we’ll need to see not just the instructions that <code>foo()</code> compiles to, but the actual machine code that <code>foo()</code> is assembled to. Let’s put <code>foo()</code> is a full program so it’s easier to do this.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
13
</pre></td><td><pre><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span><span>
</span>
<span>void</span> <span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>);</span>

<span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>void</span> <span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>i</span><span>=</span><span>0</span><span>;</span>
    <span>i</span><span>++</span><span>;</span>
    <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"i: %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>i</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now that we have <code>foo()</code> in a full C program, we can go ahead and compile it. Let’s go ahead and compile it with:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre><span>$ </span>gcc <span>-o</span> foo foo.c
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></figure>

<p>This is where things start to get interesting. We need to disassemble the binary gcc created for us to see the instructions that comprise <code>foo()</code>. We can do this with the objdump utility like so:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre><span>$ </span>objdump <span>-d</span> foo <span>&gt;</span> foo.dis
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></figure>

<p>If you open the foo.dis file in a text editor, around line 128 (depending on the version of gcc used, <code>foo</code> may have slightly different instructions) you should see the disassembled <code>foo()</code> function. It looks like the following:</p>

<p>If you have never worked with x86_64 code before, this might look a little foreign. Basically what’s going on here is that we are pushing the stack down 4 bytes (the size of an integer on my system) to use as the storage location for the variable <code>i</code>. We then initialize these 4 bytes to 0 and then add 1 to this value. Everything after this (40054b) is moving values around to prepare for calling the printf() function.</p>

<p>That said, if we want to change the value that i is incremented by, we need to change the following instruction:</p>

</pre></td><td><pre>400547:	83 45 fc 01          	addl   $0x1,-0x4(%rbp)
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></figure>

<p>Before going any further though, let’s break this instruction down.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><code>400547</code></th>
      <th><code>83 45 fc 01</code></th>
      <th><code>addl $0x1,-0x4(%rbp)</code></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>The first column is the memory location of this instruction.</td>
      <td>The second column is the machine code of the instruction. These are the bytes that the CPU will read and react to.</td>  
      <td>The third column is the human readable (well, readable to humans with some prior knowledge), disassembled machine code from the second column.</td>  
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Going further, we can break down the instruction to understand its operands:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><code>addl</code></th>
      <th><code>$0x1</code></th>
      <th><code>-0x4(%rbp)</code></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>addl</code> is the instruction. There are multiple add commands in the x86_64 instruction set. This one means add an 8bit value to a register or memory location.</td>
      <td><code>$0x1</code> is an immediate value. Dollar signs denote immediate values and the <code>0x</code> prefix denotes a hexadecimal number follows. In this case, the number is just 1 since <code>0x1 = 1</code> in base 10.</td>  
      <td><code>-0x4(%rbp)</code> is the memory address to add the value to. Here it is saying to add it to the current location of the base stack pointer offset by 4 bytes. This is where our <code>i</code> variable was put on the stack.</td>  
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Now that we understand the human readable form of the instruction, let’s dive into the machine instruction. All x86_64 instructions have the following format:</p>

<p><img src="https://ephemeral.cx/assets/images/2013/12/Instruction-Format.png" alt=""></p>

<p>This is where x86_64 gets really complicated. x86_64 instructions have a variable length so to the unfamiliar, decoding instructions by hand can be a confusing and time consuming process. To make it easier, there are various documentation sources. x86ref.net has great documentation once you learn how to read it <a href="http://ref.x86asm.net/coder64.html#x83">such as the reference for the <code>addl</code> instruction</a>. For the brave, there is also the <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/64-ia-32-architectures-software-developer-manual-325462.html">Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Developer’s Manual: Combined Vols. 1, 2, and 3</a> (warning: 3,000 page PDF).</p>

<p>In our case, these bytes mean the following:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><code>83</code></th>
      <th><code>45</code></th>
      <th><code>fc</code></th>
      <th><code>01</code></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>83</code> is the opcode of the <code>addl</code> instruction. All instructions have an opcode that tells the CPU what instruction to perform.</td>
      <td><code>45</code> is the ModR/M byte. Per Intel's documentation, <code>0x45 = [RBP/EBP]+disp8</code>. This means that <code>0x45</code> denotes the <code>%rbp</code> register is the destination and the byte that follows (in this case, <code>0xfc</code>) is the displacement byte.</td>  
      <td><code>fc</code> is the displacement byte. <code>0xfc = 0b11111100</code>. The displacement byte is sign-extended so this value is really just <code>0b100</code> or 4.</td>  
      <td><code>01</code> is the immediate value that will be added to the given memory address. <strong>This is the byte we need to change in order to change the value that <code>i</code> is incremented by.</strong></td>  
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>How did I determine what the ModR/M byte meant? There is a <a href="http://ref.x86asm.net/coder64.html#modrm_byte_32_64">handy table in the documentation that explains what each ModR/M byte means</a>. This table is also available in the Intel manual linked to above as Table 2-2 in section 2-5 of volume 2A (or page 445 of the PDF).</p>

<hr>

<p>Moving right along, we now are able to change the instruction and know what to change; we just need to know how to change it.</p>

<p>To recap, we want to change the 01 byte in the <code>addl $0x1,-0x4(%rbp)</code> instruction.</p>

<p>To do this, we need to get the address of that byte. It’s trivial to get the address of <code>foo()</code> at runtime so all we need to do is find the offset of this byte from start of <code>foo()</code>. There’s two ways we can do this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Use the objdump disassembly from earlier to count the number of bytes between the start of the function and the byte we want.</li>
  <li>Write a function to print the instructions of <code>foo()</code> and their offset from the start of the function.</li>
</ol>

<p>Why not do both?</p>

<p>Let’s look at the objdump method first. The disassembly of <code>foo()</code> up to the <code>addl</code> instruction we’re interested in is:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
</pre></td><td><pre>0000000000400538 &lt;foo&gt;:
  400538:	55                   	push   %rbp
  400539:	48 89 e5             	mov    %rsp,%rbp
  40053c:	48 83 ec 10          	sub    $0x10,%rsp
  400540:	c7 45 fc 00 00 00 00 	movl   $0x0,-0x4(%rbp)
  400547:	83 45 fc 01          	addl   $0x1,-0x4(%rbp)
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></figure>

<p>The function starts at <code>400538</code> and the byte we’re interested in is at <code>40055a (400547 + 3)</code> (remember, these are hex values!) so that means the offset is <code>40055a - 400538 = 12</code>. Because this is a hex value, when we’re calculating offsets we need to either use hex values or convert it to base 10. The latter is easier so let’s say that an offset of <code>0x12 = 18</code> is what we’re looking for.</p>

<p>We can confirm this by writing a short function to print the instructions of a given function. Here’s the modified program from above:</p>

<p>Note that to determine the length of <code>foo()</code>, we added an empty function, <code>bar()</code>, that immediately follows <code>foo()</code>. By subtracting the address of <code>bar()</code> from <code>foo()</code> we can determine the length in bytes of <code>foo()</code>. This, of course, assumes that <code>bar()</code> immediately follows <code>foo()</code>.</p>

<p>At address <code>0x40057e</code> is our <code>0x1</code> byte. As you can see, the offset is indeed 18.</p>

<p>We’re finally read to change some code! Given a pointer to <code>foo()</code>, we can create an unsigned char pointer to the exact byte we want to change as such:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

<span>*</span><span>instruction</span> <span>=</span> <span>0x2A</span><span>;</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></figure>

<p>Assuming we did everything right, this will change the immediate value in the <code>addl</code> instruction to <code>0x2A</code> or 42. Now when we call <code>foo()</code>, it will print 42 instead of 1.</p>

<p>Success! The first time we call <code>foo()</code> it prints 1 just as its source code says it should. Then after we modify it it prints 42.</p>

<hr>

<p>And there you have it, a self-mutating C program. However, this is pretty boring; all it does is change a number. Wouldn’t it be more far more interesting if we could change <code>foo()</code> to do something else entirely? How about <code>exec()</code> a shell?</p>

<p>How would we go about starting a shell when we call <code>foo()</code> though? The natural choice is to use the <code>execve</code> syscall, but that’s a lot more involved than just changing a single byte.</p>

<p>If we’re going to change <code>foo()</code> to exec a shell, we’re going to need the instructions for doing as such. Fortunately for us, the security community loves using machine code for exec’ing shells so this is easy to get our hands on. A quick search for “x86_64 shellcode” and we have the instructions for exec’ing a shell. These are as follows:</p>

<p>This code was taken from <a href="http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/13691/">http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/13691/</a> with two modifications by me as outlined below.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I added <code>xor %rax, %rax</code> so that the <code>%rax</code> register is zero’d. Otherwise, it may not be and this would cause a segfault.</li>
  <li>I changed the immediate value <code>$0x68732f6e69622f2f</code> to <code>$0x68732f6e69622f00</code>. This allowed me to remove a shift instruction which kept the total length at 30 bytes. Normally, shellcode like this is injected via buffer overflows or other kinds of malicious attacks that exploit flaws in a program’s string handling. C-strings are terminated with the NUL character which has a value of 0. Thus, most of the string.h functions will return when they read a NUL byte. Security people like to avoid NUL’s for this reason. In this case, NUL characters are perfectly fine so we can just replace the extra <code>0x2f</code> with an <code>0x00</code> and drop the shift command. See the original code in the link above for how my modifications differ.</li>
</ul>

<p>Before going further, let’s explain what the shellcode above is doing. First we need to understand how a syscall works. A syscall, or system call, is a function call to the kernel asking that the kernel do something for us. This may be something that only the kernel has the permissions to do so we have to ask it to do it for us. In this case, the execve syscall tells the kernel that we would like it to start another process and replace our process address space with this new process’s address space. This means that, assuming execve succeeds, our process is essentially done executing.</p>

<p>In order to make a syscall on x86_64, we have to prepare for the syscall by moving the correct values to the correct registers and then issuing with <code>syscall</code> instruction. These correct values and registers are unique to each OS. I’m focusing on Linux here so let’s look at the documentation for the <code>execve</code> syscall:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><code>%rax</code></th>
      <th>Syscall</th>
      <th><code>%rdi</code></th>
      <th><code>%rsi</code></th>
      <th><code>%rdx</code></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>59</code></td>
      <td><code>sys_execve</code></td>  
      <td><code>const char *filename</code></td>  
      <td><code>const char *const argv[]</code></td>  
      <td><code>const char *const envp[]</code></td>  
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>It’s important to note that <strong>the values of these registers should be pointers to the memory location of their respective values</strong>. This means that we’ll have to push all the values to the stack and then copy the correct stack locations to the registers above. And you thought you would never say “wow, I miss the simplicity of pointers in C.”</p>

<p>A full list of syscalls can be found at <a href="http://blog.rchapman.org/post/36801038863/linux-system-call-table-for-x86-64">http://blog.rchapman.org/post/36801038863/linux-system-call-table-for-x86-64</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re familiar with the C prototype for the <code>execve()</code> function (below for reference), you’ll see that how similar the syscall setup is to calling the function from a C program.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre><span>int</span> <span>execve</span><span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>filename</span><span>,</span> <span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>const</span> <span>argv</span><span>[],</span> <span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>const</span> <span>envp</span><span>[]);</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></figure>

<p>For those familiar with x86, it’s important to note that the syscall procedure is quite different between x86 and x86_64. The syscall instruction does not exist in the x86 instruction set. In x86 syscalls are made by triggering an interrupt. Furthermore, in Linux, the syscall number for <code>execve</code> is different between x86 and x86_64. (11 on x86; 59 on x86_64).</p>

<p>Now that we know how to set up a syscall, let’s explain each step of the shellcode.</p>

<hr>

<p>Now we’re ready to change <code>foo()</code> to execute this shellcode. Instead of changing a single byte in <code>foo()</code> like before, we now want to replace <code>foo()</code> entirely. This looks like a job for <code>memcpy()</code>. Given a pointer to the start of <code>foo()</code> and a pointer to our shellcode, we can copy the shellcode to the location of <code>foo()</code> as such:</p>

<p>The only thing we have to be careful of writing past the end of <code>foo()</code>. In this case, we’re safe because <code>foo()</code> is 41 bytes long and the shellcode is 29 bytes. Note that because the shellcode is a C string, it has a NUL character at the end. We only want to copy the actual shellcode bytes so we subtract 1 from the <code>sizeof</code> shellcode in the length argument of <code>memcpy</code>.</p>

<p>Awesome! Let’s put it all together into a final program now.</p>

    <p>The retirement regime has also been branded “completely unfair” by Jesper Ettrup Rasmussen, the chairman of Denmark’s confederation of trade unions.</p><p>“Denmark has a healthy economy and yet the EU’s highest retirement age. A higher retirement age means that [people will] lose the right to a dignified senior life,” he said in comments reported by the BBC.</p><p>The retirement age is a sensitive subject in Europe, with higher life expectancy and budget deficits pushing each generation to work for longer than its predecessor.</p><p>As a result, Denmark’s decision to have the highest retirement age somewhat contradicts its reputation as an exceedingly prosperous and comfortable Nordic state.</p><p>In neighbouring Sweden, pension benefits can still be claimed by citizens as young as 63. In France, there were mass protests and riots when Emmanuel Macron’s government imposed a law raising the retirement age from 62 to 64.</p><p>In the United Kingdom, those born between 1955 and 1960 generally start to receive their pension at 66, but the threshold gradually increases for those born after 1960.</p>

        <!-- <h1 class="post-title">Writing your own CUPS printer driver in 100 lines of Python</h1> -->

        <section>
            <p>In <a href="https://pretix.eu/about/en/blog/20171007-release-180/">version 1.8</a> of pretix, we introduced shipping
management as a new feature for the pretix Hosted and Enterprise editions. With this plug-in, you can choose not to
deliver your tickets to your visitors as a downloadable file, but to send them via snail mail instead. Of course,
you can just download those tickets as regular-sized PDF files, print them out and ship them, but the feature is
usually most interesting if you want to send out high-quality tickets that look good e.g. in a gift wrapping under
a christmas tree or pinned to a wall as a souvenier of the event.</p>

<p>For this purpose, you will need a thermal ticket printer as well as suitable ticket paper. Last year, I took a closer
look at this market and tested devices from two of the major ticket printer vendors: The <a href="https://tls-bocasystems.com/en/38/lemur">BOCA Lemur</a>
as well as the <a href="http://www.practicalautomation.com/cost-effective-ticket-printers.html">Practical Automation uITL+2003CF</a> model.
In our test, the printing quality of both printers was very similar. The uITL+ is missing a network port in contrast to the 
BOCA Lemur, but the uITL+ features a nicer case (smaller and metal instead of plastic) and is way more affordable to obtain,
at least here in Europe.</p>

<p>For this reason, we chose the uITL+ as our reference printer and for our first customer installation. You’ve already
seen a photo of the uITL+ in our last blogpost:</p>

<p><img src="https://behind.pretix.eu/assets/images/2018-01-cups/printer.jpg" alt="Ticket printer"></p>

<p>However, there is another downside to the uITL+: It only comes with a Windows driver, while the BOCA printers come with
drivers for all platforms, including <a href="http://www.bocasystems.com/linux_driver.php">packages</a> for Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora,
CentOS, Arch Linux, FreeBSD, and even an ARM build for the Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>Both printers speak FGL (“Friendly Ghost Language”) over the wire, a communication protocol common to the world
of ticketing printers. With FGL, you can send ASCII text and style information in order to render your tickets directly
on the printer (but we want to send PDFs rendered on the server instead, which is why we need a driver to convert).
Documentations of FGL can be obtained via the websites of <a href="http://www.bocasystems.com/documents/fgl46.doc">both</a>
<a href="http://www.practicalautomation.com/uploads/6/3/3/0/633048/pmitx308.pdf">vendors</a>. This also means that the drivers are, in
theory, cross-compatible with minimal adjustments in configuration.
However, the license of the BOCA driver forbids using their driver to control printers of other vendors. Additionally, no
sources of the driver are available and some builds (like the ARM build of the Raspberry Pi package) only run on very old operating systems
since they link to very old library versions.</p>

<p>Therefore, to use the uITL+ from a Linux operating system, we need to roll our own driver.</p>

<p>Printing on unix-like operating systems like Linux or macOS is usually done through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUPS">CUPS</a>
daemon. CUPS is responsible for handling printer configuration, scheduling print jobs and actually talking to the printer
over the wire. Unfortunately, though, CUPS does not speak FGL out of the box.</p>

<p>If we look into CUPS’ <a href="https://www.cups.org/doc/postscript-driver.html">documentation on driver development</a>, we see that we
basically need to work on two tasks:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>We need to write a filter program that takes rastered pixel data as an input and outputs FGL code.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We need to generate a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript_Printer_Description">PPD file</a> that contains configuration
information about the printer (i.e. name, name of the newly created filter, paper sizes, cutter settings).</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="writing-a-cups-filter">Writing a CUPS filter</h3>

<p>Let’s get started with writing our CUPS filter, which we will call <code>rastertofgl</code>. Usually, most CUPS filters are written
in C, but I decided to choose Python instead – not only because I know it better, but also because writing it in a compiled
language also means that we need to cross-compile it to different architectures like ARM if we want to run it on devices
like the Raspberry Pi, which creates additional effort. Basically, we can use any language because the filter just needs
to be an executable that reads a data stream on standard input and outputs a data stream on standard output.</p>

<p>The incoming data stream consists of pages of data in the <a href="https://www.cups.org/doc/spec-raster.html">CUPS Raster Format</a>,
version 3. Every page starts with a page header of fixed length containing meta information such as the color space, page 
size, orientation, etc. In order to be able to conveniently access this data later, let’s start by defining a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple">namedtuple</a>
for storage. For brevity, I’m not including all the 104 properties here:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>CupsRas3</span> <span>=</span> <span>namedtuple</span><span>(</span>
    <span>'CupsRas3'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>'MediaClass MediaColor MediaType OutputType AdvanceDistance '</span>
    <span>'AdvanceMedia Collate CutMedia Duplex HWResolutionH '</span>
    <span>'HWResolutionV ImagingBoundingBoxL ImagingBoundingBoxB '</span>
    <span>'ImagingBoundingBoxR ImagingBoundingBoxT InsertSheet Jog '</span>
    <span>'LeadingEdge MarginsL MarginsB ManualFeed MediaPosition'</span>
    <span>...</span>
<span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Next, we make use of the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html">struct</a> module from Python’s standard library
to read the magic word from the beginning and then split the binary stream into all its different components. From the
header, we then know the width and height of the page in pixels as well as the number of bits per pixels, allowing us to
read all of the page into a bytearray and then continuing with parsing the next page:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>read_ras3</span><span>(</span><span>rdata</span><span>):</span>

        <span>]</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>pages</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This allows us to read all the data we get from CUPS!</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>pages</span> <span>=</span> <span>read_ras3</span><span>(</span><span>sys</span><span>.</span><span>stdin</span><span>.</span><span>buffer</span><span>.</span><span>read</span><span>())</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now, we need to interpret this data as an image and then re-output it as FGL.
Unfortunately, CUPS sends us grayscale values and our printer only supports pixels that are
either fully black or white. Since we do not want to drop grayscale values compeltely,
we want to apply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dither">Dither</a>. Additionally, to make the
conversion logic easier, we want to rotate the picture since we want to print the tickets
in landscape mode (<a href="https://github.com/pretix/cups-fgl-printers/issues/1">for now</a>).</p>

<p>This makes it cumbersome with pure standard library features, so I decided that it is feasible
to introduce <a href="https://pillow.readthedocs.io/">Pillow</a> as a dependency, since Pillow is also
available from the package repositories of all major Linux distributions – and probably installed
on your system already. Let’s go ahead and load the pixels into Pillow, then!</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>for</span> <span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>datatuple</span> <span>in</span> <span>enumerate</span><span>(</span><span>pages</span><span>):</span>

        <span>raise</span> <span>ValueError</span><span>(</span>

    <span>im</span> <span>=</span> <span>im</span><span>.</span><span>rotate</span><span>(</span><span>90</span><span>)</span>
    <span>pixels</span> <span>=</span> <span>im</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>()</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>j</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span> <span>in</span> <span>enumerate</span><span>(</span><span>imgdata</span><span>):</span>
        <span>pixels</span><span>[</span><span>j</span> <span>%</span> <span>header</span><span>.</span><span>cupsWidth</span><span>,</span> <span>j</span> <span>//</span> <span>header</span><span>.</span><span>cupsWidth</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>b</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Pillow can automatically convert the picture to black and white for us, if we ask it to:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python">    <span>im</span> <span>=</span> <span>im</span><span>.</span><span>convert</span><span>(</span><span>'1'</span><span>)</span>
    <span>pixels</span> <span>=</span> <span>im</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>()</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If we want to send the raster data to the printer, we need to follow the FGL instructions
for graphical data, which expects us to send 8 lines of pixels at a time: One byte for each
column with each bit of the byte representing one of the 8 lines. We therefore loop over
the image in blocks of 8 lines and create a row of bytes for each of these blocks. If any
of these pixels is non-white, we’ll send the row to the printer, preceeded my a “move”
command:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python">    <span>for</span> <span>yoffset</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>im</span><span>.</span><span>height</span><span>,</span> <span>8</span><span>):</span>
        <span>row</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span> <span>*</span> <span>im</span><span>.</span><span>width</span>

                <span>if</span> <span>pixels</span><span>[</span>

<p>Almost there! We now only need to send either “print” or a “print and cut” command, depending
on the options of the print job (or the printer’s defautl options):</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python">    <span>if</span> <span>header</span><span>.</span><span>CutMedia</span> <span>in</span> <span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span> <span>and</span> <span>i</span> <span>==</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>pages</span><span>)</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>:</span>
        <span># Cut after last ticket of file/job/set
</span>        <span>sys</span><span>.</span><span>stdout</span><span>.</span><span>buffer</span><span>.</span><span>write</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>'&lt;p&gt;'</span><span>)</span>
    <span>elif</span> <span>header</span><span>.</span><span>CutMedia</span> <span>==</span> <span>4</span><span>:</span>  <span># Cut after page
</span>        <span>sys</span><span>.</span><span>stdout</span><span>.</span><span>buffer</span><span>.</span><span>write</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>'&lt;p&gt;'</span><span>)</span>
    <span>else</span><span>:</span>  <span># Do not cut
</span>        <span>sys</span><span>.</span><span>stdout</span><span>.</span><span>buffer</span><span>.</span><span>write</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>'&lt;q&gt;'</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>We can now test that our filter is running correctly by obtaining a sample stream of CUPS raster data
and piping it through our filter and directly into the printer:</p>

<pre><code># cat sample.raster | ./rastertofgl &gt; /dev/usb/lp1
</code></pre>

<p>It works! To use this with cups, we now also need to write a PPD file.</p>

<h3 id="ppd-printer-defintion">PPD printer defintion</h3>

<p>PPD is a nasty format that is no fun to write by hand. Luckily, CUPS comes with a tool named <a href="https://www.cups.org/doc/man-ppdc.html">ppdc</a>
that allows us to write a slightly higher-level DRV file and then later compile it to a PPD. The full reference for
DRV files can be found <a href="https://www.cups.org/doc/ref-ppdcfile.html">here</a>. For our case we start with some boilerplate
details like the printer’s name:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;font.defs&gt;
#include &lt;media.defs&gt;
{
  Manufacturer "Practical Automation"
  ModelName "ITL-2003"
  PCFileName "paITL2003.ppd"
  Version 1.0
  Attribute "NickName" "" "Practical Automation ITL-2003"
</code></pre>

<p>Next, we define the name of the filter that we want to apply, which is the rastertofgl script we just wrote:</p>

<pre><code>  Filter "application/vnd.cups-raster 100 rastertofgl"
</code></pre>

<p>We also need to tell CUPS the DPI and the color model, in order to receive the correct number and type of pixels for our
filter:</p>

<pre><code>  *Resolution - 8 0 0 0 203dpi
  ColorModel Gray/Grayscale w chunky 0
</code></pre>

<p>We want to give the user the option to turn the printer’s cutter on or off – or choose whether the printer shall cut after
every single ticket or just after every print job:</p>

<pre><code>  Group "General/General"
    Option "fooCutMedia/Cut Labels" PickOne AnySetup 10,0
      Choice "Never/Never cut media" "&lt;&lt;/CutMedia 0&gt;&gt;setpagedevice"
      *Choice "Job/Cut after job" "&lt;&lt;/CutMedia 2&gt;&gt;setpagedevice"
      Choice "Page/Cut after every ticket" "&lt;&lt;/CutMedia 4&gt;&gt;setpagedevice"
</code></pre>

<p>CUPS also has an integrated <code>Cutter yes</code> directive, but this only allows to turn the cutter on or off completely, while
we want to have all three options here.</p>

<pre><code>  VariablePaperSize Yes
  HWMargins 0,00 0,00 0,00 0,00
  MinSize 0,00 0,00
  MaxSize 0,00 0,00
</code></pre>

<p>And then, finally, we need to specify all paper sizes that we want to support. We like tickets of the regular 8x3.25” size
best, but our PPD file includes 55 other different paper sizes as well. Here’s just one example of how this looks:</p>

<pre><code>  CustomMedia "ticket8x3.25/Ticket 8x3.25in" 576,00 234,00 1,00 2,00 0,00 0,00 "&lt;&lt;/PageSize[576 234]/ImagingBBox null&gt;&gt;setpagedevice" "&lt;&lt;/PageSize[576 234]/ImagingBBox null&gt;&gt;setpagedevice"
</code></pre>



<p>Half a day, 100 lines of python, and 69 test tickets printed later, we’re done! We just need to place the filter and the 
PPD files in the correct places and our printer driver will be
available to use. To make it easier for you, I created packages for <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/cups-fgl-printers-git/">Arch Linux</a>
and <a href="https://download.pretix.eu/">Debian</a>.
All source code of the driver can be found on <a href="https://github.com/pretix/cups-fgl-printers">GitHub</a>, of course.</p>

<p>Some issues remain, for example our filter currently fails for unclear reasons whenever I want to print a PDF from a GTK-based
PDF viewer – printing the same file with <code>lpr</code> from the command line works fine.</p>
