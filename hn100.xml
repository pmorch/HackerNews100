<p>Don't let <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/chrome-is-getting-a-big-redesign-with-rounded-corners-material-you-colors/">Chrome's big redesign</a> distract you from the fact that Chrome's invasive new ad platform, ridiculously branded the "Privacy Sandbox," is also getting a widespread rollout in Chrome today. If you haven't been following this, this feature will track the web pages you visit and generate a list of advertising topics that it will share with web pages whenever they ask, and it's built directly into the Chrome browser. It's been in the news previously as "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/04/everybody-hates-floc-googles-tracking-plan-for-chrome-ads/">FLoC</a>" and then the "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/01/google-drops-floc-after-widespread-opposition-pivots-to-topics-api-plan/">Topics API</a>," and despite widespread opposition from just about every non-advertiser in the world, Google owns Chrome and is one of the world's biggest advertising companies, so this is being railroaded into the production builds.</p>
<p>Google seemingly knows this won't be popular. Unlike the glitzy front-page Google blog post that the redesign got, the big ad platform launch announcement is tucked away on the <a href="https://privacysandbox.com/news/privacy-sandbox-for-the-web-reaches-general-availability">privacysandbox.com</a> page. The blog post says the ad platform is hitting "general availability" today, meaning it has rolled out to most Chrome users. This has been a long time coming, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/20/google-starts-the-ga-rollout-of-its-privacy-sandbox-apis-to-all-chrome-users/">the APIs</a> rolling out about a month ago and a million incremental steps in the beta and dev builds, but now the deed is finally done.</p>

<p>Users should see a pop-up when they start up Chrome soon, informing them that an "ad privacy" feature has been rolled out to them and enabled. The new pop-up has been hitting users all week. As you can see in the pop-up, all of Google's documentation about this feature feels like it was written on opposite day, with Google calling the browser-based advertising platform "a significant step on the path towards a fundamentally more private web."</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The argument here is that someday—not now, but someday—Google promises to turn off third-party tracking cookies in Chrome, and the new ad platform, which has some limitations, is better than the free-for-all that is third-party cookies. The thing is, third-party cookies mostly only affect Chrome users. Apple and Firefox have both been blocking third-party cookies for years and won't be implementing Google's new advertising system—it's only the Chromium browsers that still allow them.
</p><p>That's actually what started this whole process: Apple dealt a giant blow to Google's core revenue stream when it blocked third-party cookies in Safari in 2020. While it was a win for privacy, Google's not following suit until it can secure its advertising business. The Federated Learning of Cohorts and now the Topics API are part of a plan to pitch an "alternative" tracking platform, and Google argues that there <em>has</em> to be a tracking alternative—you can't just not be spied on. The Electronic Frontier Foundation also argued this when it called Google's FLoC a "<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/03/googles-floc-terrible-idea">terrible idea</a>," saying "[Google's] framing is based on a false premise that we have to choose between 'old tracking' and 'new tracking.' It’s not either-or. Instead of re-inventing the tracking wheel, we should imagine a better world without the myriad problems of targeted ads."</p>
<p>Chrome has some controls for this built into the browser now. Just go to the Chrome Settings, then "Privacy and Security," then "Ad privacy" (alternatively, paste "chrome://settings/adPrivacy" into the address bar). From there, you can click through to each of the <em>three</em> individual pages and turn off the top checkbox, and in a mere six clicks, you can presumably turn off the ad platform. If you leave it on for a while, you can check out the "Ad topics" page, where Google will show you what ads Chrome things you would like to see. This list gets sent to advertisers when you visit a page.</p>
<p>Google says it will block third-party cookies in the second half of 2024—presumably after it makes sure the "Privacy Sandbox" will allow it to keep its profits up. Did any user in the world want a user tracking and ad platform baked directly into their browser? Probably not, but this is Google, and they control Chrome, and this probably still won't make people switch to Firefox.</p>

<p>In a new report, the federal department charged with analyzing how efficiently US taxpayer dollars are spent, the Government Accountability Office, says NASA lacks transparency on the true costs of its Space Launch System rocket program.</p>
<p>Published on Thursday, the new report (<a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-23-105609.pdf">see .pdf</a>) examines the billions of dollars spent by NASA on the development of the massive rocket, which made a successful debut launch in late 2022 with the Artemis I mission. Surprisingly, as part of the reporting process, NASA officials admitted the rocket was too expensive to support its lunar exploration efforts as part of the Artemis program.</p>
<p>"Senior NASA officials told GAO that at current cost levels, the SLS program is unaffordable," the new report states.</p>
<h2>Poor tools to understand true costs</h2>
<p>The Government Accountability Office expressed serious concerns about NASA's decision not to measure production costs of SLS rocket elements, including the core stages and rocket engines needed for future launches. Instead, NASA told the report authors that it plans to "monitor production costs and affordability of the SLS program via the five-year production and operations cost estimate."</p>
<p>However, the report states, these are "poor tools" for a cost baseline for the SLS rocket program and will make it difficult for taxpayers to measure costs and the performance of NASA and its contractors over time. Moreover, the report indicates that NASA has not regularly updated its five-year production cost estimates for the rocket. The report also cites concerns about development costs of future hardware for NASA's big-ticket rocket program, including the Exploration Upper Stage.</p>
<p>Another problem with NASA's cost estimates is that they do not appear to account for delays to Artemis missions. It is probable that the Artemis II mission, a crewed flight around the Moon, will launch no earlier than 2025. The Artemis III crewed landing will likely slip to at least 2026, if not more, with additional delays down the line. At least one NASA official apparently told the Government Accountability Office that these delays would have no cost impacts, which seems highly improbable.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>"Some NASA officials told us that changes to Artemis mission dates should not affect the SLS program’s cost estimate," the report states. "Other officials noted that the program’s cost estimate would be expected to increase to account for the delay to the Artemis IV mission, which shifted from 2026 to 2028."</p>
<h2>How to pare back unsustainable costs</h2>
<p>NASA officials interviewed by the Government Accountability Office acknowledged that they were concerned about the costs of the SLS rocket.</p>
<p>"NASA recognizes the need to improve the affordability of the SLS program and is taking steps to do so," the report states. "Senior agency officials have told us that at current cost levels the SLS program is unsustainable and exceeds what NASA officials believe will be available for its Artemis missions."</p>
<p>Officials from the space agency said they had a four-step plan to reduce costs of the SLS rocket program over time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stabilize the flight schedule</li>
<li>Achieve learning curve efficiencies</li>
<li>Encourage innovation</li>
<li>Adjust acquisition strategies to reduce cost risk</li>
</ul>
<p>Setting aside that some of these goals sound suspiciously like corporate speak, the report makes clear that these are aspirational aims for now. "NASA, however, has not yet identified specific program-level cost-saving goals which it hopes to achieve," the authors write. "NASA has made some progress toward implementing these strategies, but it is too early to fully evaluate their effect on cost."</p>
<h2>Can NASA really control costs?</h2>
<p>While NASA certainly deserves credit for talking about the excessive cost of the SLS rocket—a fact that has been pointed out by critics for more than a decade but largely ignored by NASA officials and congressional leaders—it is not at all clear that they will be able to control costs. For example, NASA recently said that it is working with the primary contractor of the SLS rocket's main engines, Aerojet, to reduce the cost of each engine by 30 percent, down to $70.5 million by the end of this decade.</p>
<p>However, NASA's inspector general, Paul Martin, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/05/a-new-report-finds-nasa-has-spent-an-obscene-amount-of-money-on-sls-propulsion/">said this claim was dubious</a>. According to Martin, when calculating the projected cost savings of the new RS-25 engines, NASA and Aerojet only included material, engineering support, and touch labor, while project management and overhead costs are excluded.</p>
<p>And even at $70.5 million, these engines are very, very far from being affordable compared to the existing US commercial market for powerful rocket engines. Blue Origin manufactures an engine of comparable power and size, the BE-4, for less than $20 million. And SpaceX is seeking to push the similarly powerful Raptor rocket engine costs even lower, to less than $1 million per engine.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.adept.ai/blog/persimmon-8b">https://www.adept.ai/blog/persimmon-8b</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37422615">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
  <p>We’re excited to open-source Persimmon-8B, the best fully permissively-licensed model in the 8B class.
The code and weights are <a href="https://github.com/persimmon-ai-labs/adept-inference">here</a>.</p>
<p>At Adept, we’re working towards an AI agent that can help people do anything they need to do on a computer. We’re not in the business of shipping isolated language models (LMs)—this was an early output of the model scaling program that will support our products.</p>
<p>Over the last year, we’ve been amazed by how smart small models are becoming, and we wanted to give the community access to an even better 8B LM to build on for any use case, with an open Apache license and publicly accessible weights. The 8B size is a sweet spot for most users without access to large-scale compute—they can be finetuned on a single GPU, run at a decent speed on modern MacBooks, and may even fit on mobile devices.</p>
<p>Persimmon-8B has several nice properties:</p>
<ol>
<li>This is the most capable open-source, fully permissive model with fewer than 10 billion parameters. We are releasing it under an Apache license for maximum flexibility.</li>
<li>We trained it from scratch using a context size of 16K. Many LM use cases are context-bound; our model has 4 times the context size of LLaMA2 and 8 times that of GPT-3, MPT, etc.</li>
<li>Our base model exceeds other ~8B models and matches LLaMA2 performance despite having been trained on only 0.37x as much data as LLaMA2.</li>
<li>The model has 70k unused embeddings for multimodal extensions, and has sparse activations.</li>
<li>The inference code we’re releasing along with the model is unique—it combines the speed of C++ implementations (e.g. FasterTransformer) with the flexibility of naive Python inference.</li>
</ol>
<p>We’re excited to see how the community takes advantage of these capabilities not present in other open source language models, and we hope this model spurs even greater innovation!</p>
<p><strong>Because this is a raw model release, we have not added further finetuning, postprocessing or sampling strategies to control for toxic outputs.</strong></p>
<h2 id="a-more-realistic-way-of-doing-evals">A more realistic way of doing evals</h2>
<p>Determining the quality of a language model is still as much art as science. Model quality is not an absolute metric and depends on how the language model will be used. In most use cases, we expect language models to generate text. However, a common methodology for evaluating language models doesn’t actually ask them to generate any text at all. Consider the following multiple choice question from the common HellaSwag eval set. The goal is to pick which of the four answers best continues the “question.”</p>
<p><em>A woman is outside with a bucket and a dog. The dog is running around trying to avoid a bath. She…</em></p>
<p><em>a) rinses the bucket off with soap and blow dries the dog’s head.<br>
b) uses a hose to keep it from getting soapy.<br>
c) gets the dog wet, then it runs away again.<br>
d) gets into a bathtub with the dog.</em></p>
<p>One way to evaluate the model is to simply ask it to answer the question and then see which choice it makes – (a), (b), (c), or (d).  This mimics the experience of how people actually interact with language models – they ask questions and expect answers. This is analogous to e.g. <a href="https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/latest/">HELM</a>.</p>
<p>A more common practice in ML is instead to use the implicit probabilities that the language model assigns to each choice. For option (a) above, we calculate the probability of “rinses” given the previous sentences, and then probability of “the” given the previous sentences plus “rinses,“ and so on. We then multiply all these probabilities together, giving the probability of the entire sequence for option (a). We do this for all four choices (optionally adding length normalization to account for different length sequences) and select the option with the highest sequence probability. This is a fine way to measure the intrinsic knowledge of a language model, but a poor way to understand what actually interacting with it is like.</p>
<p>Since we care about interacting with language models, we do all of our evals with the former technique–we directly generate answers from the model. We’re releasing the prompts we use so that others can reproduce these numbers.</p>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>We compared Persimmon-8B to the current most powerful model in its size range—<a href="https://ai.meta.com/llama/">LLama 2</a>—and to <a href="https://www.mosaicml.com/blog/mpt-7b">MPT 7B Instruct</a>.
Our instruction-fine-tuned model—Persimmon-8B-FT—is the strongest performing model on all but one of the metrics.
Our base model—Persimmon-8B-Base—performs comparably to Llama 2, despite having seen only 37% as much training data.</p>

<h2 id="model-details">Model Details</h2>
<p>Persimmon-8B is a standard decoder-only transformer with several architecture modifications.</p>
<p>We use the squared ReLU activation function<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-activationnote" id="user-content-fnref-activationnote" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup>. We use rotary positional encodings – our internal experiments found it superior to Alibi. We add layernorm to the Q and K embeddings before they enter the attention calculation.</p>
<p>The checkpoint we are releasing has approximately 9.3B parameters. In order to make pipelining during training more efficient, we chose to decouple the input and output embeddings. Doing this does not increase the capacity of the model–it is purely a systems optimization to avoid all-reducing the gradients for the (very large) embeddings across potentially slow communication links. In terms of inference cost, the model is equivalent to an 8B parameter model with coupled input/output embeddings.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in a space-constrained environment, the 70k unused embeddings (corresponding to reserved tokens) could be removed from the input/output embedding matrices.
This would reduce the model size by approximately 570M parameters.</p>
<p>We train the model from start to finish with a sequence length of 16K on 737B tokens uniformly sampled from a much larger dataset, which is a mix of text (~75%) and code (~25%).</p>
<p>Natively training on such long sequences throughout training is made possible by our development of an improved version of <a href="https://www.adept.ai/blog/flashier-attention">FlashAttention</a>, (<a href="https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention">Github</a>). We also modified the base for rotary calculations to allow for full position resolution at this longer length. This contrasts with all other open source models, which use a sequence length of at most 4096 for the majority of training. We use a vocabulary of 262k tokens, built using a unigram sentencepiece model.</p>
<p>We’ve included a table with important model information below:</p>





































<table><thead><tr><th>Attribute</th><th>Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Hidden Size</td><td>4096</td></tr><tr><td>Heads</td><td>64</td></tr><tr><td>Layers</td><td>36</td></tr><tr><td>Batch Size</td><td>120</td></tr><tr><td>Sequence Length</td><td>16384</td></tr><tr><td>Training Iterations</td><td>375000</td></tr><tr><td>Tokens Seen</td><td>737 Billion</td></tr></tbody></table>
<h2 id="flexible-and-fast-inference">Flexible and Fast Inference</h2>
<p>We’re also releasing fast inference code for this model–with a short prompt, we can sample ~56 tokens per second on one 80GB A100 GPU<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-embeddingnote" id="user-content-fnref-embeddingnote" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup>. While most optimized inference code is complicated and brittle, we’ve managed to make ours flexible without sacrificing speed. We can define models in PyTorch, run inference with minimal changes, and still be faster than FasterTransformer.</p>
<p>There are two main things that slow down traditional inference implementations:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, both the Python runtime and CUDA kernel dispatch incur per-operation overheads.</li>
<li>Second, failing to fuse operations means we spend time writing to memory and then reading back again the same values; while this overhead might go unnoticed during training (which is compute bound), inference is usually bottlenecked by memory bandwidth.</li>
</ol>
<p>The standard practice for achieving fast inference is to rewrite the entire model inference loop in C++, as in FasterTransformer, and call out to special fused kernels in CUDA. But this means that any changes to the model require painfully reimplementing every feature twice: once in Python / PyTorch in the training code and again in C++ in the inference codebase.  We found this process too cumbersome and error prone to iterate quickly on the model.</p>
<p>We wanted a strategy that would fix both of these slowdowns without maintaining a separate C++ codebase.</p>
<ol>
<li>To handle operator fusion, we’ve extracted one of the attention kernels<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-kernelname" id="user-content-fnref-kernelname" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">4</a></sup> from <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/FasterTransformer">NVIDIA’s FasterTransformer repo</a>. During Python inference, we simply replace the attention operation with a call to this kernel. Because our architecture modifications don’t touch the core attention operation, this highly complex kernel can remain unmodified.</li>
<li>To handle the per-operator overheads, we use <a href="https://pytorch.org/blog/accelerating-pytorch-with-cuda-graphs/">CUDA graphs</a> to capture and replay the forward pass. We’ve also implemented this in a way that works with tensor parallelism, which lets us easily use multiple GPUs for inference.</li>
</ol>
<p>This strategy gives us the best of worlds—we can write model code in only one place while still doing inference faster than FasterTransformer. We really hope this accelerates the exciting applications that folks in the community can build.</p>
<p>This is just the first small release in a series of things we’re excited to put out this fall and winter. Enjoy!</p>

People over the internet are discussing other options, and the conclusion is that if you want to have reliable 20+ Gbps, you need to go for CCR2216, which has an MSRP of 2795$ and, not surprisingly, in Switzerland, that would be around 2420 CHF (2760$). While specs are impressive (16-core ARM CPU with 2 GHz single-core clocks, for example), the price is not very convincing.</p><p id="6613">And so I've decided to build my own router.</p><h2 id="91e8">Gathering requirements</h2><p id="bea8">Thinking about what I want my router to do is an essential first step, as I can see what I need to buy. After a bit of thinking, here is the list I've gathered:</p><ol><li id="865f">It should be able to route ≥ 20 Gbps</li><li id="8fd5">It should have at least 1 SFP28 for input and at least 2 SFP28 for output, but ideally, that should be 1 SFP28 in and 4 SFP28 out (a total of 5 in an ideal case)</li><li id="3e89">I should be able to have one port that has decent 10 Gbps performance, SFP+ or RJ45 — it doesn't matter that much.</li><li id="f513">It should be quiet as it will be in a living room (the place where I have fibre coming out of my wall)</li><li id="29d5">Ideally, it should have low power consumption.</li><li id="f797">Ideally, I should be able to reuse leftover hardware I have.</li></ol><p id="7e8a">In terms of leftover hardware, since the last PC upgrade, I have an entire Ryzen 3000 system without a case and disks sitting on a shelf (Ryzen 3900X, 32 GB of RAM, MSI X570 Ace as the motherboard and relatively old AIO water cooler, I also have a bunch of old graphics cards around).</p><h2 id="7c5d">Choosing network cards</h2><figure><figcaption>SFP+ RJ45, SFP28 with fibre attached.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="8448">A few words about PCIe</h2><p id="871f">As we are talking about bandwidth — let's do some math to check what we'll need in terms of PCIe bandwidth.</p><p id="b74f">If you want to know more about PCIe (and in simple words), I recommend a video by <a href="https://gynvael.coldwind.pl/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Gynvael Coldwind</a> called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE0fnGbI8B8" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">PCI Express To Hell</a>. But the vital thing to remember is that PCIe bandwidth for each lane is limited by a version that both the motherboard and the device support. Then, you can safely multiply single-lane bandwidth by the number of lanes the device or slot provides (the lowest number of those two). As price matters, I won't consider very new cards, so we can forget about PCIe 5.0 here (also, only Ryzen 7000 and Core 12th gen or newer might have support for that). Most of the network cards I'll consider will be relatively old, so the prime candidate here is PCIe 3.0, but there is a chance that I'll get something a bit newer — so I need to keep in mind the specs of PCIe 4.0.</p><p id="4d2d">For PCIe 3.0, single lane bandwidth is 8 GT/s (you can roughly think that it is 8 Gbps per lane, but there is overhead, so, in reality, it is a bit smaller, closer to 7.5 Gbps), and for PCIe 4.0 — that is 16 GT/s (the overhead is still there, so I will approximate that by 15 Gbps per lane).</p><p id="3b4a">Another thing to keep in mind is that desktop motherboards and CPUs support roughly 20–24 PCIe lanes in total, so it is even theoretically impossible to get more than ~360 Gbps. But there is a caveat — the slot can be (I'm talking here only about bandwidth, not physical parameters) x16, x8, x4, x2 or x1. And in reality, x2 is extremely rare. So even if the card can't consume all 8 lanes, it will still cost us all 8 if inserted into a slot that works in x8 mode.</p><p id="6ef8">A single 25 Gbps network port will need about 3.34 PCIe 3.0 lanes (rounding that up to 4), and in the case of PCIe 4.0 — half of that (rounding that up to 2). So, in the case of PCIe 3.0, it is possible to have 2 cards in x8 slots with 2x 25 Gbps ports (SFP28) or 1 card with 4 ports in x16 slot. With PCIe 4.0 (if I find an inexpensive PCIe 4.0 card with these parameters), it is theoretically possible to have 8 ports in an x16 PCIe 4.0 slot or 2x 4 port cards in x8 slots. There are 2xQSFP28 cards for PCIe 4.0; however, you will likely be limited to 4xSFP28 port cards at best.</p><p id="59ac">For cards, it is essential to verify what they can do. Some cards support both x8 PCIe 4.0 and x16 PCIe 3.0, but that is relatively rare, and newer cards (newer in this case = more expensive).</p><h2 id="aa8f">About network cards</h2><p id="b826">After some research, here is what I found online (note: I was searching for a decent quality used hardware here as well, but I would mention it only when the price difference is more than 2x compared to the price of the new — that would allow me to buy even extra pairs of spare cards in case it will stop working and still save a lot of money) and here is the list (I'll be providing both prices in CHF and USD for simplicity):</p><ol><li id="76a8">Broadcom P425G — You don't see it that often as Used on eBay, but there are some, like <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/276011814562" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">this one</a> for 195$ + 29.33$ shipping costs + duties(241.60 USD total = 213.63 CHF total, excl. duties)<br>The card has 4 SFP28 ports, supports either PCIe 4.0 x8 or PCIe 3.0 x16 (same card), passive cooling, about 19W total power consumption, and supports fancy stuff like RoCE, NVMe-oF offloading. It is, however, designed for classic enterprise with some settings available only in the network card's BIOS (which you need to enter during the boot process).</li><li id="33d9">Intel XXV710–<a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/394849367635" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">99.99$ + 32.46$</a> shipping + duties (142.65$ total = 126.07 CHF).<br>It has 2 SFP28 ports, PCIe 3.0 x8, and passive cooling. 14.1W power consumption, almost no offloads, and people saying that firmware on those cards is funky and you might need to juggle it to make it work properly (e.g. card might hang if ports are added to a bridge with other cards).</li><li id="28ed">Intel E810–339.26 CHF (incl.

It is a bit newer than XXV710 and has more offloads (RoCE v2, NVMe-oF and stuff), but power consumption is reported to be 16–20W (so a bit up compared to XXV710), but people complain about the same problems as with XXV710 — problems finding correct firmware.</li><li id="829d">Mellanox ConnectX-4 LX. The cheapest I could find was on eBay, costing 49.48 GBP (62.7 USD = 55.18 CHF). It is advertised as "brand new, made in China", but I am unsure how true that is.<br>The card has 2 SFP28 ports, PCIe 3.0 x8, and passive cooling. Power consumption is tricky as different sources tell different stories, somewhere between 7.8 and 11.1 W.<br>It has some essential offloading support, nothing fancy, though.</li><li id="4d7f">Mellanox ConnectX-5. The cheapest one I've found <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/144739330341" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">was 158$ </a>(=139.88 CHF). That version also has 2xSFP28, and the main difference between this one and ConnectX-4 is support for more offloading, including Open V-Switch. It seems overkill for home use.</li><li id="6dbe">Mellanox ConnectX-5 MCX516A-CCAT. That one has 2xQSFP28, which means a potential total bandwidth of 200 Gbps. Its price <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/305065565271" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">is 269.99$ + 30.05$ shipping + duties</a> (333.63$ total = 295.36 CHF). There are caveats there…<br>First — it is PCIe 3.0 x16, so the total available bandwidth (on the bus) is about 126 Gbps, slightly less than 200. However, some <a href="https://forums.servethehome.com/index.php?threads%2Fmellanox-flashing-connectx-5-to-connectx-5-ex-pcie-3-0-to-pcie-4-0.34865%2F=" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">forum threads</a> mention that it is possible to force-flash it into MCX516A-CDAT, which gives it PCIe 4.0 support, as it seems to use the same chip and the identical PCB. It is unknown and not guaranteed to work or be stable after that.<br>Second — it is QSFP28. You must use breakout cables unless you want 100 Gbps (over aggregated 4xSFP28). That means it will be a DAC (direct-attached copper) cable or fibre (either with an SFP28 end or just plain fibre). Usually, those cables are designed so that all 4 of your destination devices are in the same place (and in case it is a breakout to SFP28 — you'll have 4 identical SFP28 ends, which limits its compatibility as no SFP+ for you).</li><li id="71a7">Netronome Agilio CX 2x25 GbE. That one costs about<a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/185570704496" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"> 118$ + 27.21$ shipping + duties</a> (156.39$ = 138.42 CHF). It has 2xSFP28 and supports quite a lot of offloads, and what makes it interesting is that it has an SDK that allows you to do eBPF offloading or write processing in P4.</li></ol><p id="f73f">Ultimately, I decided to go for a mix of ConnectX 4-LX and Netronome because the ability to play with P4 sounded so cool that I thought it would be fun to play with it. I bought 6 Mellanoxes (2 into router, 1 into PC, 1 to Thunderbolt -&gt; PCIe for laptop and 2 spares) and 2 Netronomes.</p><h2 id="8c63">Note about ConnectX</h2><p id="07fa">I bought mine from several different sellers (including one I've mentioned here; two others were a bit more expensive) and got a mix of "Made in China" and "Made in Israel" cards as well, and they came with different firmware. One that was "Made in China" came with ancient but original firmware (it seems to be from 2018, around its manufacturing date from the sticker), but one of them was OEM Mellanox for Huawei. The difference is that with the original one, you download mlxup from the Nvidia site, and if you have internet, it updates firmware (also, beware: <strong>firmware from 2018 didn't work in all motherboards I've tried </strong>— e.x. Desktop with X670E didn't recognise the card until I updated it; I suspect that in 2018, they didn't come with UEFI-native firmware by default as the UEFI version was empty), but that doesn't work with Huawei — product ID was different. There is a trick to force-flash it with original firmware, described in two posts on the <a href="https://forums.servethehome.com/index.php?threads%2Flenovo-connectx-4-card-flash-to-mellanox.32434%2F=#post-369048" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">servethehome thread</a>.</p><p id="a6a6">TLDR: I assume you have something debian-like and downloaded new firmware from the website.

I've tried 3 different connectors — fs.com's, ubiquity's and MikroTik's (v2) — The last one didn't want to work in Mellanox card — it just doesn't power up at all without any debug messages (even in debug mode in drivers) or anything. Ubiquity's one worked well, but it is detected as 10G Ethernet, transceiver type: multimode, 50um, Shortwave laser(!) with a wavelength of 850nm(!!) which have 100m(max) length copper cable(!!!). And while that seems to work fine with Mellanox, I can quickly get that it won't start in other cards or devices.

For some reason, ethtool doesn't report the temperature of SFP+ RJ45. Still, they are known to dissipate roughly 2–3W of power, which is quite a lot for a connector and without active cooling of your card, it will likely overheat under certain conditions.</p><p id="430c">Other than that, I bought a few SFP28 single-mode fibre modules from fs.com, and they are working fine, as well as SFP28 DACs. However, if you want to support European manufacturers — you might want to consider buying from Flexoptix. Remember that you need to check wavelength for both rx and tx. Whatever is needed on the receiving side will be specified by your ISP; however, for connecting different devices, you will need to swap RX and TX wavelength on the other end. For, you went for TX 1331 and RX 1271 nm on the router, then on NAS, you will need to have TX 1271 and RX 1331 modules. Websites usually will advise you on what to get.</p><h2 id="7279">Singlemode vs multimode vs DAC</h2><p id="85d8">The maximum length of DAC cables is only about 10 meters (33 feet), and as I needed fibre across my apartment, I went for DAC only for connection between Router and NAS as there is no reason to move them away from each other.</p><p id="2b0a">I went for single-mode everywhere for the sole reason of unification, as I already have single-mode fibre as input. Also, in that case, I can change the cables or modules in case of any failures. Single-mode cables are cheaper, but SFP modules are a bit more expensive; single-mode cable is thinner (one cable, while multimode is usually 2 cables attached).</p><h2 id="96d4">Cable types</h2><p id="9cb7">For multimode cables, you will have different OM specs (OM3, OM4, etc.). Speed and distance will depend on what you will get. OM3 is usually used for 10G for up to 300 meters; it can work for 25Gbps or 40Gbps, but distance will be significantly reduced (to 70–100 meters). In many places, it is mentioned that SFP28 is usually combined with OM4 cables. I haven't tried it, though, as I went for single-mode cables.</p><p id="ff41">For single-mode cables, I went for BiDi SFPs (I am not even sure if you can find non-BiDi SFP28 ones) and simplex cables. Connector type is essential; when connecting 2 devices, you want to get LC UPC / LC UPC ones.</p><p id="bbf1">Remember that cutting fibre and adding a new connector is more complex. You will need a Kevlar Cutter to cut fibre, an Optical Stripper to cut out extra stuff from the cable, a Cleaver to align it and pre-polished field assembly connectors to put back on. You can mend the cable, but a device wielding fibre costs about 2,000.</p><p id="2f25">Here, I refer to <a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2020-08-09-fiber-link-home-network/#hardware-selection" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Michael Stapelbrg's blog post</a> written in 2020 about his choice of equipment and instructions on how to use it.</p><h2 id="d868">Other hardware and final configuration</h2><p id="a932">I've replaced my AIO water cooling with a simple air cooler.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Since our <a href="https://www.modular.com/blog/a-unified-extensible-platform-to-superpower-your-ai">launch</a> of the Mojo programming language on May 2nd, more than 120K+ developers have signed up to use the Mojo Playground and 19K+ developers actively discuss Mojo on <a href="https://discord.gg/modular">Discord</a> and <a href="https://github.com/modularml/mojo">GitHub</a>. Today, we’re excited to announce the next big step in Mojo’s evolution: <strong>Mojo is now available for local </strong><a href="https://developer.modular.com/"><strong>download</strong></a> – beginning with <strong>Linux systems</strong>, and adding Mac and Windows in coming releases.</p><p>While the <a href="https://playground.modular.com/">Mojo Playground</a> provides an easy hosted introduction to the language, the local Mojo toolchain empowers developers to accomplish much more. Local developer tools provide access to the full power of Mojo, including <strong>a full set of compiler features and IDE tools that make it easy to build and iterate on Mojo applications</strong>.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/64174a9fd03969ab5b930a08/64fa0ab7e29b0d13abaabff4_mojo-eco.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>In this blog post, we’ll take a high-level tour of what’s inside the Mojo SDK. First, let’s quickly review what Mojo is and how it can benefit you.</p><h3>Mojo: a high performance 'Python++' language for compute</h3><p>Mojo is <strong>a new programming language for AI developers that will grow into being a superset of Python over time</strong>. It already supports integrating with arbitrary Python code seamlessly and has a scalable programming model to target performance-critical systems, including accelerators (e.g. GPUs) that are pervasive in AI.</p><p>Mojo meets you where you are today, and enables you to progressively adopt new features to enable high performance where you need it. Mojo combines the best of dynamic and static languages together, and can achieve <a href="https://www.modular.com/blog/mojo-a-journey-to-68-000x-speedup-over-python-part-3">up to 68,000x the performance</a> of Python today. You can read more about <a href="https://docs.modular.com/mojo/why-mojo.html">Mojo’s origin story</a> in our docs, but let’s recap a few important benefits that Mojo unlocks for users:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Write everything in one language</strong>: Mojo meets AI developers where they are, combining the usability of Python with the systems programming features that cause developers to have to reach for C, C++, or CUDA. Your research and deployment teams can now work in a common codebase, streamlining the research to production workflow.</li><li><strong>Unlock Python performance</strong>: Python is pervasive, but not the right tool for tasks that require high performance or exotic hardware. Mojo enables high performance on CPUs, as well as support for exotic accelerators like GPUs and ASICs, providing performance on par with C++ and CUDA.</li><li><strong>Access the entire Python ecosystem</strong>: Mojo provides full interoperability with the Python ecosystem, making it seamless to use the Python libraries while taking advantage of Mojo’s features and performance benefits. For example, you can seamlessly intermix NumPy and Matplotlib with your Mojo code.</li><li><strong>Upgrade your AI workloads</strong>: Mojo integrates tightly with the Modular AI Engine, empowering you to easily extend your AI workloads with custom operations, including pre-processing, post-processing operations and high-performance mathematical algorithms. You can integrate kernel fusion, graph rewrites, shape functions, and more.</li></ul><p>As we’ve shown in <a href="https://www.modular.com/blog/how-mojo-gets-a-35-000x-speedup-over-python-part-1">past</a> <a href="https://www.modular.com/blog/how-mojo-gets-a-35-000x-speedup-over-python-part-2">blog</a> <a href="https://www.modular.com/blog/mojo-a-journey-to-68-000x-speedup-over-python-part-3">posts</a>, with simple code changes to existing Python code, you can get significant (&gt;68000x) speedups with Mojo for compute-bound workloads. If you are a Python programmer, check out <a href="https://www.modular.com/blog/an-easy-introduction-to-mojo-for-python-programmers">this blog post</a> for an easy introduction to performance optimizations with Mojo.&nbsp;</p><p>Mojo is now available for download to your computer, but Mojo is a lot more than a compiler.</p><h3>The Mojo Toolbox</h3><p>The first release of the Mojo SDK comes with <strong>everything you need to easily develop Mojo programs</strong>. This includes the following tools:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>mojo driver:</strong> provides a shell (for read-eval-print-loop or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">REPL</a>), and allows you to build and run Mojo programs, package Mojo modules (including support for the 🔥 extension!), generate docs, and format code<a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=modular-mojotools.vscode-mojo"><strong>‍</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=modular-mojotools.vscode-mojo"><strong>Extension for Visual Studio Code (VS Code)</strong></a>: supports various productivity features such as syntax highlighting, code completion, and more&nbsp;<strong>‍</strong></li><li><strong>Jupyter kernel:</strong> supports building and running Mojo notebooks, including Python code<strong>‍</strong></li><li><strong>Debugging support (coming soon):</strong> step into and inspect running Mojo programs, even intermixing C++ and Mojo stack frames</li></ul><p>This initial release of the SDK supports X86/Linux systems, and we will expand to additional operating systems, hardware, and tool features in upcoming updates.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/64174a9fd03969ab5b930a08/64f8bbb424cf49c042319fed_Tf_aqSWFNEZO993md-Yuh7Bs5ZEMglx-kyDaTzq66m1q3W4eGqFtaH6warFjp69XTIk2bvVj-q2caffdimzLZMQkl9gs3_HA5p9uXjd0YfHiZwrJryiYWJGN5QoxnpSgwflRyHOllLZwe0HN7kbSAU8.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>A view of the Mojo SDK</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>Now, let’s take a look at each of the tools available in the current release of the SDK.</p><h3>Mojo Driver</h3><p>Just as with Python, you can start programming in a REPL by running the mojo command. Here is an example that calculates Euclidean distance in Mojo from our previous blog post:</p><div><pre><code>
$ mojo
Welcome to Mojo! 🔥
Expressions are delimited by a blank line.
Type `:mojo help` for further assistance.
1&gt; %%python

1290.8521425092235
35. print(naive_dist)
36. 
1290.8521425092235

    
</snip></snip></snip></code></pre></div><p>‍</p><p>What’s more, Mojo allows you to build statically-compiled executables that you can deploy without any dependencies. For example, you can compile and run the <em>hello.🔥</em> program from our examples repository as follows:</p><div><pre><code>
$ mojo build hello.🔥

$ ./hello
Hello Mojo 🔥!
9
6
3

$ ls -lGtranh hello*
-rw-r--r-- 1 0   817 Sep  3 23:59 hello.🔥
-rwxr-xr-x 1 0   22K Sep  3 23:59 hello
    
</code></pre></div><p>‍</p><p>A 22 kB statically-compiled binary is pretty cool, and is made possible by Mojo’s tight dependency management.</p><h3>Visual Studio Code Extension</h3><p>Visual Studio Code is one of the <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#section-most-popular-technologies-integrated-development-environment">most popular IDEs</a> in the world, and Mojo supports it directly with&nbsp;an <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=modular-mojotools.vscode-mojo">official extension</a> on the Visual Studio Marketplace. This provides Mojo support for a number of developer productivity features:</p><ul role="list"><li>Syntax Highlighting</li><li>Diagnostics and Fixits</li><li>Definitions and References</li><li>Hover help</li><li>Formatting</li><li>Code Completion</li></ul><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/64174a9fd03969ab5b930a08/64f8bda6e375ba5bb5fbc52a_image7.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Mojo example in Visual Studio Code with syntax highlighting</figcaption></figure><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/64174a9fd03969ab5b930a08/64f8bbb5dde5c488dd3a6e1d_JlECZhqxLRj9esUgU1iXlBeDK-EFzY4qw--TbGGaKIsG8QNgY8Z5kjS7m42vwwfjw5CeGbPT-Wm5K6XtNdPmdvasfpi8h9jPm3Txthimst29QmgAMPTzce1xWZXRQ4XPWkxj5MnPKFULX4oTEzMMlPI.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Visual Studio Code showing code completion; the left screenshot shows available modules and types.

		<p>Microsoft’s AI-powered Copilots are changing the way we work, making customers more efficient while unlocking new levels of creativity. While these transformative tools open doors to new possibilities, they are also raising new questions. Some customers are concerned about the risk of IP infringement claims if they use the output produced by generative AI. This is understandable, given recent public inquiries by authors and artists regarding how their own work is being used in conjunction with AI models and services.</p>
<p>To address this customer concern, Microsoft is announcing our new Copilot Copyright Commitment. As customers ask whether they can use Microsoft’s Copilot services and the output they generate without worrying about copyright claims, we are providing a straightforward answer: yes, you can, and if you are challenged on copyright grounds, we will assume responsibility for the potential legal risks involved.</p>
<p>This new commitment extends our existing intellectual property indemnity support to commercial Copilot services and builds on our previous <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/06/08/announcing-microsofts-ai-customer-commitments/">AI Customer Commitments</a>. Specifically, if a third party sues a commercial customer for copyright infringement for using Microsoft’s Copilots or the output they generate, we will defend the customer and pay the amount of any adverse judgments or settlements that result from the lawsuit, as long as the customer used the guardrails and content filters we have built into our products.</p>
<p>You’ll find more details below. Let me start with <em><u>why</u></em> we are offering this program:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>We believe in standing behind our customers when they use our products.</strong> We are charging our commercial customers for our Copilots, and if their use creates legal issues, we should make this our problem rather than our customers’ problem. This philosophy is not new: For roughly two decades we’ve defended our customers against patent claims relating to our products, and we’ve steadily expanded this coverage over time. Expanding our defense obligations to cover copyright claims directed at our Copilots is another step along these lines.</li>
<li><strong>We are sensitive to the concerns of authors, and we believe that Microsoft rather than our customers should assume the responsibility to address them.</strong> Even where existing copyright law is clear, generative AI is raising new public policy issues and shining a light on multiple public goals. We believe the world needs AI to advance the spread of knowledge and help solve major societal challenges. Yet it is critical for authors to retain control of their rights under copyright law and earn a healthy return on their creations. And we should ensure that the content needed to train and ground AI models is not locked up in the hands of one or a few companies in ways that would stifle competition and innovation. We are committed to the hard and sustained efforts that will be needed to take creative and constructive steps to advance all these goals.</li>
<li><strong>We have built important guardrails into our Copilots to help respect authors’ copyrights.</strong> We have incorporated filters and other technologies that are designed to reduce the likelihood that Copilots return infringing content. These build on and complement our work to protect digital safety, security, and privacy, based on a broad range of guardrails such as classifiers, metaprompts, content filtering, and operational monitoring and abuse detection, including that which potentially infringes third-party content. Our new Copilot Copyright Commitment requires that customers use these technologies, creating incentives for everyone to better respect copyright concerns.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>More details on our Copilot Copyright Commitment</strong></p>
<p>The Copilot Copyright Commitment extends Microsoft’s existing IP indemnification coverage to copyright claims relating to the use of our AI-powered Copilots, including the output they generate, specifically for paid versions of Microsoft commercial Copilot services and Bing Chat Enterprise. This includes Microsoft 365 Copilot that brings generative AI to Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and more – enabling a user to reason across their data or turn a document into a presentation. It also includes GitHub Copilot, which enables developers to spend less time on rote coding, and more time on creating wholly new and transformative outputs.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/5/2023/09/Copilot-Indemnification-Blog-Image-UPDATE.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="2880" height="1350" src="https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/5/2023/09/Copilot-Indemnification-Blog-Image-UPDATE.png" alt="" srcset="https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/5/2023/09/Copilot-Indemnification-Blog-Image-UPDATE.png 2880w, https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/5/2023/09/Copilot-Indemnification-Blog-Image-UPDATE-300x141.png 300w, https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/5/2023/09/Copilot-Indemnification-Blog-Image-UPDATE-1024x480.png 1024w, https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/5/2023/09/Copilot-Indemnification-Blog-Image-UPDATE-768x360.png 768w, https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/5/2023/09/Copilot-Indemnification-Blog-Image-UPDATE-1536x720.png 1536w, https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/5/2023/09/Copilot-Indemnification-Blog-Image-UPDATE-2048x960.png 2048w, https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/5/2023/09/Copilot-Indemnification-Blog-Image-UPDATE-1920x900.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2880px) 100vw, 2880px"></a></p>
<p>There are important conditions to this program, recognizing that there are potential ways that our technology could intentionally be misused to generate harmful content. To protect against this, customers must use the content filters and other safety systems built into the product and must not attempt to generate infringing materials, including not providing input to a Copilot service that the customer does not have appropriate rights to use.</p>
<p>This new benefit doesn’t change Microsoft’s position that it does not claim any intellectual property rights in the outputs of its Copilot services.</p>
<p>We have published more details of the Copilot Copyright Commitment for customers and welcome the opportunity to have further conversations as Copilots become more widely available.</p>
<p><strong>Our shared AI journey</strong></p>
<p>Today’s announcement is a first step. Like all new technologies, AI raises legal questions that our industry will need to work through with a wide array of stakeholders. This step represents a pledge to our customers that the copyright liability of our products is ours to shoulder, not theirs.</p>
<p>Microsoft is bullish on the benefits of AI, but, as with any powerful technology, we’re clear-eyed about the challenges and risks associated with it, including protecting creative works. It is our responsibility to help manage these risks by listening to and working with others in the tech sector, authors and artists and their representatives, government officials, the academic community, and civil society. We look forward to building on such announcements with new initiatives that help ensure that AI advances the spread of knowledge while protecting the rights and needs of creators.</p>

Over the past two and a half years, TAG has continued to track and disrupt campaigns from these actors, <a href="https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/countering-threats-north-korea/">finding 0-days</a> and protecting online users. Recently, TAG became aware of a new campaign likely from the same actors based on similarities with the previous campaign. TAG is aware of at least one actively exploited 0-day being used to target security researchers in the past several weeks. The vulnerability has been reported to the affected vendor and is in the process of being patched.</p><p data-block-key="9i3qk">While our analysis of this campaign continues, we are providing an early notification of our initial findings to warn the security research community. We hope this post will remind security researchers that they could be targets of government backed attackers and to stay vigilant of security practices.</p></div>

        <p data-block-key="83kli">Similar to the previous campaign TAG reported on, North Korean threat actors used social media sites like X (formerly Twitter) to build rapport with their targets. In one case, they carried on a months-long conversation, attempting to collaborate with a security researcher on topics of mutual interest. After initial contact via X, they moved to an encrypted messaging app such as Signal, WhatsApp or Wire. Once a relationship was developed with a targeted researcher, the threat actors sent a malicious file that contained at least one 0-day in a popular software package.</p>

The <a href="https://github.com/dbgsymbol/">source code</a> for this tool was first published on GitHub on September 30, 2022, with several updates being released since. On the surface, this tool appears to be a useful utility for quickly and easily downloading symbol information from a number of different sources. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/symbols">Symbols</a> provide additional information about a binary that can be helpful when debugging software issues or while conducting vulnerability research.</p><p data-block-key="2u0jk">But the tool also has the ability to download and execute arbitrary code from an attacker-controlled domain.

Your local Bar Association will be able to give you a list of firms/attorneys that practice in this area, or your existing lawyer may have a recommendation. Many law firms will give you a short consultation for free. Bring a succinct written summary of the facts with you that briefly describes the product, how you discovered the issue, and what you found when you investigated, with dates. Include a list of evidence items you have already collected. Litigation is difficult and expensive, but if you have a strong case (and it sounds like you do) then the law firm may take it on contingency in return for a larger portion of the settlement/judgment.<p>EDIT: I wouldn't trust the opinions of the 'just execute better' posters here, considering your competitors' employees already infiltrated your slack channel.

It happens all the time. Personally I would prefer that the world didn't work this way, but it's just how the game is played.<p>There are a lot of people in the tech world with the right connections, access to capital, and execution skill, but who either aren't creative enough to come up with an innovative product, or prefer to be the nth-mover in an already-validated market to the risk of trying to establish a new market. If they see that you have a good idea but aren't executing/growing/raising money at an A+ level, they will swoop in and copy your idea and then pretend that they were the first to come up with it.</p><p>There's nothing necessarily wrong with this apart from (imo) being kind of lame on a personal level. The consumer ultimately benefits from the competition, and you have only yourself to blame really for creating an opening by not executing quickly and effectively enough. It's capitalism. All the solutions to this 'problem' I've ever heard proposed--software patents and the like--create far worse problems for people who want to innovate.</p><p>If you're working on a new idea and are seeing real traction, you just need to expect this and factor it into your strategy. This is why so much emphasis is placed on having a 'moat' of some kind that is difficult to reproduce. If you're seeing success and it's easy to copy you, someone's probably already working on a clone.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Since Tailscale was founded in 2019, customers have been forced to choose between either Tailscale or Mullvad without the ability for them to co-exist.</p>

<p>Today we announce a partnership with Tailscale that allows you to use both in conjunction through the Tailscale app. This functionality is not available through the Mullvad VPN app.</p>

<p>This partnership allows customers of Tailscale to make use of our WireGuard VPN servers as “exit nodes”. This means that whilst connected to Tailscale, you can access your devices across Tailscale’s mesh network, whilst still connecting outbound through Mullvad VPN WireGuard servers in any location.</p>

<p>Some simple examples of this could be:</p>

<p><strong>Mobile phone:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Connects to a PC via Tailscale at your home to access private photo albums</li>
	<li>At the same time: browses the Internet via a Mullvad VPN server located in Sweden</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Personal computer:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Connects via Tailscale to another PC whilst in a cafe to work on self-hosted documents</li>
	<li>At the same time: sends all other traffic through Mullvad VPN whilst on unencrypted WiFi</li>
</ul>

            <pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2023 15:22:26 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.kagi.com/small-web">https://blog.kagi.com/small-web</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37420281">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            
            <p>As a part of our ongoing pursuit to humanize the web, we are pleased to announce the launch of Kagi Small Web.</p>

<h2>What is Kagi Small Web?</h2>

<p>While there is no single definition, “small web” typically refers to the non-commercial part of the web, crafted by individuals to express themselves or share knowledge without seeking any financial gain. This concept often evokes nostalgia for the early, less commercialized days of the web, before the ad-supported business model took over the internet (and we started <a href="https://blog.kagi.com/age-pagerank-over">fighting back</a>!)</p>

<p>For a deeper understanding, Ben Hoyt’s “<a href="https://benhoyt.com/writings/the-small-web-is-beautiful/">The Small Web is Beautiful</a>” serves as an excellent primer. Additionally, our GitHub repository links to <a href="https://github.com/kagisearch/smallweb#small-web-is-beautiful">several more articles</a> on this topic.</p>

<p>Kagi Small Web offers a fresh approach by promoting recently published content from the “small web.” We gather new content, published within the last week, from a handpicked list of blogs and surface it in multiple ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Directly within <a href="https://kagi.com/">Kagi search results</a> for applicable queries (existing Kagi members do not need to do anything, this will be automatic)</li>
<li>Via the new <a href="https://kagi.com/smallweb">Kagi Small Web website</a></li>
<li>Through the Kagi Small Web <a href="https://kagi.com/api/v1/smallweb/feed">RSS feed</a></li>
<li>Via our Search API, where results are now part of the <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/api/enrich.html">news enrichment API</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Initially inspired by a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36575081">vibrant discussion on Hacker News</a>, we began our experiment in late July, <a href="https://twitter.com/KagiHQ/status/1685376538852687873">highlighting blog posts from HN users</a> within our search results. The positive feedback propelled the initiative forward. Today, our evolving concept boasts a curated list of nearly 6,000 genuine websites featuring people with a wide variety of interests.</p>

<p>The entire Kagi Small Web initiative, including the list of curated websites, is open-source and can be found on <a href="https://github.com/kagisearch/smallweb">Kagi’s GitHub</a>.</p>

<h2>Small Web in Kagi Search: A Unique Flavor</h2>

<p>Since inception, we’ve been featuring content from the small web through our proprietary Teclis and TinyGem <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/search-details/search-sources.html#internal">search indexes</a>. This inclusion of high-quality, lesser-known parts of the web is part of what sets Kagi’s search results apart and gives them a unique flavor.</p>

<p>Today we’re taking this a step further by integrating Kagi Small Web results into the index.</p>

<p>For instance, a search for “<a href="https://kagi.com/search?q=swiftui&amp;r=us&amp;sh=KDbKVza9CAapjd2vu2dOmg">swiftui</a>” now brings up <a href="https://useyourloaf.com/blog/swiftui-sensory-feedback/">this</a> intriguing article from the small web.  It discusses a noteworthy change in iOS 17 and comes from Keith Harrison’s “Use Your Loaf” blog. Yes, you’ve just met one of your “web neighbors.”</p>

<p><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2023-09-06/1694022077-846506-screenshot-2023-09-06-at-104044.png" alt="swiftui search example"></p>

<p>(note that the example Kagi search URL has been generated using Kagi’s “<a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/getting-started/#sharing-search-results">Share this Search</a>” feature, enabling users without a Kagi account to view the results)</p>

<p>And to compare to the above, see Google’s search results for “<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=swiftui">swiftui</a>”.</p>

<p>Another example: a search for “<a href="https://kagi.com/search?q=apple+watch&amp;r=us&amp;sh=dx8wSwPLpyWhxxOEJvGJQQ">apple watch</a>” yields <a href="https://www.screamingatmyscreen.com/so-long-apple-watch/">this recent piece</a> from Timo’s ‘Screaming at My Screen’ blog.</p>

<p><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2023-09-06/1694023033-814006-screenshot-2023-09-06-at-105649.png" alt="apple watch example"></p>

<p>Notice how it adds a fresh perspective to the prevailing opinions on Apple Watch, including a fascinating neighboring result about <a href="https://prometheus.med.utah.edu/~bwjones/2015/07/apple-watch-pixels/">Apple Watch Pixels</a> from 2015, coming from our Teclis index.</p>

<p>Compare this diversity to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=apple+watch">Google’s results</a> for the same term.</p>

<p>We strongly believe that including the results from the “small web” not only brings us closer to a more humane experience in the web search, but makes the search genuinely better!</p>

<h2>Introducing the Kagi Small Web Website</h2>

<p>We are also launching the <a href="https://kagi.com/smallweb">Kagi Small Web website</a>,  a new platform through which we want to surface all the recent content from the small web, that usually zips by in legacy search engines.</p>

<p><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2023-09-06/1694030544-838854-screenshot-2023-09-06-at-130216.png" alt="Kagi Small Web website"></p>

<p>Designed in line with the ethos of the “small web,” our website operates without JavaScript.</p>

<p>Here, you can “appreciate” a post or jot down a temporary public note about it. These notes will vanish in about a week as we cycle in new content - emphasizing the fleeting, imperfect nature of the small web.</p>

<p>When we previewed the site to a select group of beta testers on our <a href="https://kagi.com/discord">Discord channel</a>, one user was especially excited to find their blog among the curated feeds. Though they hadn’t posted recently and weren’t featured on the KSW website, they felt inspired to write more. This enthusiasm serves as a direct counter to the creeping “adshitification” of the web, encouraging genuine content over commercial clutter.</p>

<p>Our selection criteria for the curated feeds are:</p>

<ul>
<li>The blog must have a post at least three years old.</li>
<li>Content must be in English (hard to curate non-English).</li>
<li>The site should offer authentic self-expression or high informational value.</li>
<li>No NSFW</li>
</ul>

<p>For a post to appear on the KSW website, additional conditions include:</p>

<ul>
<li>It needs to be no older than seven days.</li>
<li>The site should be compatible with iframe embedding. If it’s not, we’ll still index it for our search results.</li>
</ul>

<p>The website is also <a href="https://github.com/kagisearch/smallweb/tree/main/app">open source</a>, and we’re open to merge requests.</p>

<h2>Discover Small YouTube</h2>

<p>Explore our experimental “Small YouTube” feature <a href="https://kagi.com/smallweb/?yt">here</a>.</p>

<p>It surfaces content from emerging YouTube creators who have fewer than 400k subscribers. Your feedback on this criterion is welcome.</p>

<h2>Access via Feed and API</h2>

<p>Obtain real-time updates from Kagi Small Web through our <a href="https://kagi.com/api/v1/smallweb/feed/">RSS feed</a>, refreshed every 5 hours.</p>

<p>For API enthusiasts, Kagi Small Web is integrated into our <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/api/enrich.html">TinyGem index</a>, offering high-quality, non-mainstream news from around the web at $2 per 1000 queries.</p>

<h2>How to Contribute and Provide Feedback</h2>

<p>We’re open to refinements. If you notice omissions or inclusions that don’t fit, please contribute to our curated list following the <a href="https://github.com/kagisearch/smallweb/tree/main#add-a-site-or-channel-to-the-list">guidelines</a>.</p>

<p>For bug reports and feature suggestions, head to <a href="https://kagifeedback.org/">kagifeedback.org</a> and use the small-web tag to categorize your post.</p>

<p>For general discussions, join us on <a href="https://kagi.com/discord">Kagi Discord</a>.</p>

<h2>Final Words</h2>

<p>The driving question behind this initiative was simple yet profound: the web is made of millions of humans, so where are they? Why do they get overshadowed in traditional search engines, and how can we remedy this?</p>

<p>This project required a certain leap of faith as the content we crawl may contain anything, and we are putting our reputation on the line vouching for it.</p>

<p>But we also recognize that the “small web” is the lifeblood of the internet, and the web we are fighting for. Those who contribute to it have already taken their own leaps of faith, often taking time and effort to create, without the assurance of an audience.</p>

<p>Our goal is to change that narrative. Together with the global community of people who envision a different web, we’re committed to revitalizing a digital space abundant in creativity, self-expression, and meaningful content - a more humane web for all.</p>

            <link>https://tailscale.com/blog/mullvad-integration/</link>
            <guid>37420053</guid>
            <pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2023 15:09:19 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://tailscale.com/blog/mullvad-integration/">https://tailscale.com/blog/mullvad-integration/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37420053">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>Tailscale has partnered with Mullvad to make its global network of VPN servers available for our customers. You can now easily browse the web using any one of Mullvad’s available servers as a Tailscale <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1103/exit-nodes/">exit node</a> while maintaining the user privacy that’s synonymous with Mullvad.</p>
<p><a href="https://mullvad.net/">Mullvad</a> is a Virtual Private Network (VPN) service that’s known for its strong commitment to user privacy, anonymity, and security. It safeguards user privacy by not logging or monitoring user activity, and it uses a unique account number system for subscriptions, meaning personal data is not tied to your account. Services like Mullvad help you browse the internet more privately.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of this new partnership means that even when you’re far from home, you can stay connected to the things you care about via Tailscale and maintain private internet browsing from your tailnet thanks to Mullvad’s secure and high-speed global network.</p>
<h3 id="tailscale-vs-mullvad">Tailscale vs. Mullvad</h3>
<p>You may have heard the term VPN being used interchangeably to refer to Tailscale and services like Mullvad. While both uses are technically correct, there’s a stark difference in why you’d use each type of service. Tailscale helps smooth out the connectivity problems of today by building you a personal private internet, which we call a tailnet. This helps you connect to the services and people you care about, securely, from just about anywhere on the planet. Privacy VPNs help you connect to the internet in a secure, private, and anonymous manner. You can protect yourself from advertisers, ISPs, threat actors on a public Wi-Fi network, marketing sites, and more by using a privacy VPN to mask your device identity.</p>
<p>Before today, you’d have to roll your own infrastructure to get some of the same benefits of a privacy VPN while using Tailscale. With our Mullvad partnership, that changes.</p>
<h3 id="mullvad-is-your-privacy-edge">Mullvad is your privacy edge</h3>
<p>When you use Mullvad, you get instant access to hundreds of servers in 40+ countries around the world. To connect to any one of those servers, your device generates a WireGuard key pair: the public key is used to identify peers in Mullvad’s infrastructure, and the private key is used to encrypt traffic. When you use Tailscale with a Mullvad exit node, it’s the same thing! Your node registers its existing Tailscale-generated WireGuard key pair with Mullvad’s infrastructure. Any traffic coming over the internet is terminated at Mullvad’s network edge, and end-to-end encrypted all the way to your device. Basically, you get to bring Mullvad’s entire fleet of servers into your tailnet.</p>
<h3 id="tailscale-is-a-coordination-layer">Tailscale is a coordination layer</h3>

        <p>Mullvad never knows who you are; just that a device is connecting to one of its servers to proxy internet-bound traffic.</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Tailscale acts as a coordination layer between your devices and Mullvad’s network edge. Tailscale’s control layer continually updates the available Mullvad network map, and tells your devices which servers to connect to in each available region or city, and alerts your device of any changes that may affect your connection. Tailscale then lets your device know which Mullvad nodes are available, and sends your device connection information for the selected region or city. From there, traffic goes directly through the connected Mullvad node to the internet. Like other traffic flowing over your tailnet, your data is end-to-end encrypted. Tailscale doesn’t have the private key, so we can’t see your traffic.</p>
<h3 id="using-mullvad-exit-nodes">Using Mullvad Exit Nodes</h3>
<p>Starting today, you can use Mullvad exit nodes to do things like privately and securely browse the web at home or on-the-go, protect yourself prying eyes on public Wi-Fi, connect to the internet from specific locations around the globe, and forward non-standard port traffic like web, game, or media servers through Mullvad’s network edge. Want to give it a try yourself?</p>
<ul>
<li>To enable Mullvad Exit Nodes, have a tailnet admin head over to the <a href="https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/general">general settings</a> page of your admin console, and click <strong>Configure</strong>.</li>
<li>Select the devices you’d like to use with Mullvad on your tailnet.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="private-and-mostly-anonymous">Private and (mostly) anonymous</h3>
<p>Tailscale is a privacy-first company, and we go out of our way to design our software to preserve the privacy of its users. We’re also an identity-based company, and that property is similarly built into our architecture. Each Tailscale connection is a WireGuard tunnel — which is end-to-end encrypted, meaning that we can’t see the contents of the traffic even if we wanted to, and also authenticated, providing strong guarantees that traffic is flowing between endpoints that are who they claim to be.</p>
<p>You can see how this works in the design of the feature we’re announcing today. Mullvad is not sent any of your personal information; while Tailscale knows who you are through associated identity providers, this information is never needed for a connection to Mullvad’s servers. We let your local Tailscale client know where to send over its public WireGuard keys to establish a connection. From there, any traffic to the internet will flow through Mullvad VPN infrastructure, obscuring the personal details of your device, network, and connection from prying eyes.</p>
<p>For many use cases, that is a great combination. You get Tailscale’s strong privacy guarantees and a framework that keeps the number of parties with access to your identity to a minimum. It’s not true anonymity, because that’s a problem Tailscale is not trying to solve. But for the many users who want Tailscale’s powerful encryption and ease of use, and whose threat model allows for that kind of conditional anonymity, it works.</p>
<p>There are also valid use cases that require privacy <em>and</em> true anonymity. But there are risks to providing these guarantees commercially, <a href="https://mullvad.net/en/blog/2023/5/29/removing-the-support-for-forwarded-ports/">as cited by Mullvad</a> and <a href="https://www.ivpn.net/blog/gradual-removal-of-port-forwarding/">others</a>. Bad actors can take advantage of these services, turning them into abuse vectors. That in turn can lead to a worse experience for everyone, including the people who most rely on these services for their own safety. This is a genuinely hard problem, compounded by the fact that it can affect vulnerable populations with very little room for error. For people with this challenging threat model, education is important: resources like <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/">EFF’s Surveillance Self-Defense guide</a> can help explain what tools are appropriate.</p>
<h3 id="mullvad--tailscale">Mullvad + Tailscale</h3>
<p>Mullvad exit nodes are ready to use starting today, available as a public beta. You can scale your Mullvad use across your family or team for a rate of $5 per month for every 5 devices with access, with recurring automated billing. Mullvad is available as a paid add-on to any current Tailscale plans, including our Free plan. To get started, head over to your <a href="https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/general">general settings</a> tab in the admin console and select <strong>Configure</strong>.</p>

This week's question had me busy doing a lot of research, including consulting Dr. Emilie Zuniga, <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/language-tips-from-a-hyperpolyglot/">a hyperpolyglot</a>. Let's take a look!</p><h3 id="our-question-this-week">Our question this week:</h3><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div><p>Dear Duolingo,</p><p>

I love Dear Duolingo and reading about how different languages can be! My question is: Are there any words that all languages have in common?
</p><p>
Thanks,<br>
One-hit wonder
</p></div><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>If you're learning a new language, you already know that grammar can be wildly different, new sounds can be incredibly hard to learn, and of course each word is different! Even <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/cognates-in-spanish/#what-is-a-cognate">cognates</a>—words that look and mean the same in different languages—can <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/false-cognates/">sometimes be misleading</a>. Cognates get borrowed from one language to another, or they get passed down from an older language (like Latin) to the languages that evolve from it (like <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/what-are-romance-languages/">Spanish, French, and Italian</a>). </p><p>But cognates are often limited to languages spoken in the same region, or are shared across languages that have been in contact with each other. Are there any words that made it outside their region to <em>all</em> languages?</p><p>For this post, I wasn't able to research all 7000+ languages (unfortunately!). But I did look at a lot of them, and I found a surprising answer:</p><p>YES!!*</p><p>*Or, well… it seems like 2 words have come close. 😬 Let's take a look!</p><h2 id="honorable-mentions-3-words-that-made-it-pretty-far">Honorable mentions: 3 words that made it pretty far</h2><p>Before we get to the (possible) winners, there are a few words to mention that really tried their hardest to make it around the globe. For these words, there are just a few options worldwide:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>🫖 <strong>Words for tea</strong><br>Whether you take milk or sugar or prefer black or green, you probably call this drink either <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/double-names-chai-tea-naan-bread/">"tea" or "chai"</a>—and both words originated from a single word used in east Asia long ago! Which one your language uses reflects the history of this beverage and <a href="http://languageoffood.blogspot.com/2014/08/tea-if-by-sea.html?ref=blog.duolingo.com">how it traveled the world</a>. Over the centuries that single word underwent many small changes to its pronunciation in different parts of China… leading to 2 distinct words today! Which word your language uses depends on which region of China speakers of your language were trading with.</p><p><em>Exceptions: We don't know of any! But with over 7,000 languages in the world, there's bound to be some exceptions we don't know about.</em></p><p>🍍 <strong>Words for pineapple</strong><br>For this tropical fruit, there are basically 3 options around the world: words that sound like <em>ananas,</em> words that sound like <em>abacaxi</em>, and words having something to do with pine cones.</p><p><em>Ananas</em> and <em>abacaxi </em>both come from words used by the Tupi, an indigenous community in South America, where this fruit comes from. Today, you'll find a form of <em>ananas</em> in Hindi, Arabic, Swahili, and most European languages. Interestingly, both Tupi-origin words are used in Portuguese: <em>Ananás</em> is the word in Portugal, <em>abacaxi</em> is the word in Brazil, and the Portuguese-speaking Azores use both, for different kinds of pineapples!</p><p>Long ago, English used a form of <em>ananas</em> as well, but it was soon replaced by the word <em>pineapple</em>… which originally meant "pinecone"! In Germanic languages like English, <em>apple</em> was a generic word for any fruit, so a <em>pineapple</em> was the "fruit" of the pine tree. In the 17th century, 2 important things happened to change this: A new word <em>pinecone </em>came onto the scene for the pine tree fruits, and people started talking about an incredible new-to-them fruit that sort of looked like that pine tree fruit. <em>Pineapple </em>was repurposed for the new fruit!</p><p>Many languages that use <em>pineapple</em>-like words borrowed their word from English, although Spanish <em>piña</em> (like <em>pino, </em>"pine tree") evolved separately for the same reasons!</p><p><em>Exceptions: Mandarin Chinese uses a different word for pineapple.</em></p><p>🍊 <strong>Words for orange</strong><br>This citrus fruit has a similar story: A bitter orange fruit that originated in Asia was popularized and traded by merchants who used a variant of the Sanskrit word <em>naranga-s</em> (orange tree). But some centuries later, a new, sweeter orange made its way into markets worldwide, and it ended up being named after the Portuguese merchants who bought and sold it. So some languages use a <em>naranga-s</em> word (which was adopted into Persian, then Arabic, and then to European languages), and others use a word that sounds like <em>portugal</em>!</p><p>Those 2 words cover most languages, but there's a third word in the mix: <em>appelsin</em>, and words like it. These variants are found in languages of northern Europe and in Russian and Ukrainian. This is another version of <em>apple</em> showing up with that general "fruit" meaning, and the suffix <em>-sin </em>comes from the Latin word for China (an <em>appelsin </em>is a "Chinese fruit" or "Chinese apple").</p><p><em>Exceptions: Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, and Swahili use something besides these 3 options for "orange." It's also worth noting that some languages have different words for the fruit and the color, so one might be like the options here and the other could be something else!</em></p><h2 id="runners-up-2-words-that-nearly-made-it">Runners up: 2 words that *nearly* made it<br></h2><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>🚕 <strong>Words for taxi</strong><br>On this list, <em>taxi</em> is the newest, having only been coined in the early 20th century! Its swift adoption in languages worldwide reflects the <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/history-of-english-language/">growth of English</a>, car culture, and this sort of car service that charges a fee (like a <em>tax</em>!).</p><p><em>Exceptions: Mandarin Chinese and Icelandic use their own words instead of </em>taxi<em>: 出租车 (chūzūchē) in Mandarin and</em> <em>leigubíl in Icelandic.</em> <em>Modern Standard Arabic uses سيارة أجرة. In all 3, the word is based on the words for "rent" and "car"! (Note that Arabic dialects typically use a word like "taxi.")</em></p><p>🍅 <strong>Words for tomato</strong><br>Now back to foods: <em>tomato</em> is another word and food that has spread across the globe. It comes from the Nahuatl word <em>tómatl</em>, and so many communities first encountered the food from the Spanish who called it a <em>tomate</em>. </p><p><em>Exceptions: Italian uses </em>pomodoro<em>, and some other languages use a word similar to the Italian one. Mandarin Chinese is another exception!</em></p><h2 id="our-champions-2-words-that-are-the-same-worldwide">Our champions: 2 words that are the same worldwide</h2><p>This pair pushed through borders when our runners up lost steam: You can use both words in basically any country and it has the same meaning everywhere. They might be pronounced slightly differently, or have an extra ending or prefix, but the core words have made it around the world—this time, even to Chinese.</p><p>Ready? 🥁🥁🥁</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>☕️ <strong>COFFEE</strong><br>Like the other food words on this list, there was a time when coffee was unknown in much of the world. 😳 As it was traded and adopted in communities worldwide, the Arabic word &nbsp;قهوة <em>qahwah </em>was adopted along with it—and in the variants of <em>qahwah</em> you can see how languages tweak the sounds of a word to make it their own! </p><p>The Arabic "q" sounds is produced at the back of the throat, so other languages used whatever sound they had at the very back of the mouth (typically a "k" sound like in English <em>coffee</em>). The "w" in the Arabic word was also often replaced (not all languages have a "w" sound!)—the Turkish word <em>kahve</em> uses the "v" sound which is also made at the lips. It's the Turkish word that was borrowed into many European languages, and so you can see an additional change from "v" to another lip sound: the "f" you know from English <em>coffee</em>, Spanish <em>café</em>, Italian <em>caffè</em>, etc.</p><p>Are there any exceptions? 🤔 &nbsp;Probably… but we don't know them! (<a href="mailto:dearduolingo@duolingo.com">Tell us!</a>)<br></p><p>🍫 <strong>CHOCOLATE</strong><br>And alongside that hot cup of joe is the word for chocolate: It's the same everywhere around the world! If a language has a word for this confection, then it's based on a Nahuatl word or phrase for a drink made of ceiba and cocoa. The Spanish version of this word (probably quite a bit different from the original Nahuatl word) has been borrowed by communities worldwide. </p><p>When other communities and languages adopted this new food, they slightly altered the pronunciation and spelling to match their language. For example, German and Russian replaced the "ch" sound with "sh," and Japanese added "o" to the end of the English word since Japanese words can't end with "t" sounds.</p><p>Just like with the other semi-global words in this post, <em>chocolate</em> gets this honor because the food and idea of <em>chocolate</em> itself originated in one region and was unknown elsewhere—so when people first learned about the food, they learned the Nahuatl word for it at the same time, too. They went hand in hand! And as the product spread around the world, that single word was carried along for the ride.</p><p>So the world over, some variation of <em>coffee </em>and <em>chocolate</em> will get you exactly what you're hoping for!</p><h2 id="all-for-one-and-one-for-all">All for one, and one for all!</h2><p>It's fun to see what kinds of words many unrelated languages do share! And now you can be proud that you probably know 2 words in (nearly) every spoken language on earth. 😉</p><p>For more answers to your language and learning questions, get in touch with us by emailing <a href="mailto:dearduolingo@duolingo.com">dearduolingo@duolingo.com</a>.</p>

<p>Moviegoers, critics, and the average internet user have all used the aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes at one point or another. The website categorizes films and shows from “fresh” to “rotten,” with rotten being those with lower ratings. Now it looks like the site’s scores have been <a href="https://www.screengeek.net/2019/02/27/captain-marvel-rotten-tomatoes-early-user-reviews-disabled/">manipulated</a> for more than five years.</p>
<p>As noted via <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/rotten-tomatoes-movie-rating.html">Vulture</a>, it looks like a PR firm has manipulated movie scores on Rotten Tomatoes by paying the critics directly. This has been happening for years.</p>
<p>The PR firm, named Bunker 15, is said to pay as much as $50.00 for a single Rotten Tomatoes review. The payments, which aren’t typically disclosed, are usually given to obscure critics who happen to be part of a pool tracked by Rotten Tomatoes. Though it’s worth noting that the aggregation site’s rules prohibit <strong>“Reviewing based on a financial incentive.”</strong></p>
<p>Director <a href="https://www.screengeek.net/tag/paul-schrader/">Paul Schrader</a>, also a critic, spoke out against Rotten Tomatoes which he says is part of a <strong>“broken”</strong> system.</p>
<p><strong>“The system is broken. Audiences are dumber. Normal people don’t go through reviews like they used to. Rotten Tomatoes is something the studios can game. So they do.”</strong></p>
<p>The site responded by delisting a variety of Bunker 15 films from their website. Furthermore, they issued a warning to any critics that reviewed them. The warning emphasizes that they do not tolerate manipulation on their platform.</p>
<p><strong>“We take the integrity of our scores seriously and do not tolerate any attempts to manipulate them. We have a dedicated team who monitors our platforms regularly and thoroughly investigates and resolves any suspicious activity.”</strong></p>
<p>It’s possible that there are other similar cases happening on the website. And while <a href="https://www.screengeek.net/tag/rotten-tomatoes/">RT</a> can try to remove these websites – it looks like moviegoers, critics, and even studios feel that audiences just rely too heavily on the platform. And, for that reason alone, it makes sense why manipulation is bound to happen.</p>
<p>Stay tuned to ScreenGeek for any additional updates on this situation with Rotten Tomatoes as we have them.</p>

                                        <p>Over a summer of record-breaking heat and energy use, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas has frequently called on Texans to voluntarily conserve power to help shore up the grid. But on Wednesday night, ERCOT went much further, entering into emergency operations for the first time since 2021 and introducing the possibility that rolling blackouts may be necessary to stabilize the Texas power system.</p><p>The evening started, as many before it, with a conservation call. Starting around 6 p.m., ERCOT asked people to voluntarily keep their air conditioning turned down and not run big appliances. The call came, the group said, as heat drove energy demand up and wind power was forecasted to be low.</p>
<p>These calls for conservation are one option the grid operator has to help balance energy supply and demand on the grid. When supply and demand are out of whack, it disrupts the frequency over which electricity travels on the system. The frequency should be kept steady at about 60 hertz. If it deviates for too long, that can break the electric grid, <a href="https://www.kut.org/energy-environment/2021-02-24/texas-power-grid-was-4-minutes-and-37-seconds-away-from-collapsing-heres-how-it-happened" target="_blank">leading to catastrophe</a>.</p><p>Despite that call to conserve, between 6:30 p.m. and 7 p.m., the power reserves available to the Texas grid began dropping suddenly. A drop in reserves is common in the evenings, as solar power decreases as the sun goes down. But the speed at which the system lost energy suggests more was at play, prompting some grid-watchers to suspect <a href="https://twitter.com/EEpartnership/status/1699618217759514958?s=20" target="_blank">a large power plant stopped working.</a></p><p>Regardless of the cause, the shock to the system appears to have caught grid operators off guard.</p><p>When energy reserves start to look threatened, ERCOT will ideally call an Emergency Alert Level 1, allowing it to pull power resources from new places to stabilize the grid. In this case, the grid operator immediately declared an Alert Level 2 at around 7:30 p.m.</p><p>That’s the level just preceding rolling blackouts.</p><p>“Controlled outages may be needed to protect the electric system,” the group warned in an email. “Please reduce electric use. If you have medical needs, contact your local utility, and have a backup plan."</p><p>Around the same time, the frequency of the grid also started to tumble.</p><p>Declaring an energy Emergency Alert Level 2 allowed ERCOT to take several actions to rebalance the grid, including enacting more demand response programs that pay large power users to conserve energy, forcing any idling power generators (if, indeed, any were idling) to produce electrons, and trying to pull extra electricity from the few interconnections between Texas' grid and neighboring grids. Texas is the only state with its own independent power grid.</p>
<p>“Tonight, in ERCOT there was a sudden frequency drop, for reasons that are still being investigated. Industrial loads were called upon to shut down their operations and help stabilize the grid,” read a statement from the Texas Association of Manufacturers. “Many reduced their usage voluntarily, while others were retained by ERCOT in advance to address this type of unexpected situation.”</p><p>Some of these tactics have proven controversial with consumers. One program that pays <a href="https://www.kut.org/energy-environment/2023-08-28/ercot-pays-big-companies-to-conserve-power-prompting-some-consumers-to-ask-why-not-me" target="_blank">big power users like cryptocurrency operations </a>millions to conserve, has come under particular scrutiny, as Texans have been asked to conserve voluntarily for months.</p><p>If these emergency tactics don’t stabilize the grid, the next option is "rolling blackouts," meaning to cut power to users for brief periods of times to rebalance supply and demand. </p><p>On Wednesday night, that last resort was not needed. </p><p>The emergency lasted about two hours, after which ERCOT said grid conditions had returned to normal.</p><p>“By entering EEA 2, ERCOT was able to utilize additional reserve resources to protect the reliability of the grid,” the grid operator <a href="https://twitter.com/ERCOT_ISO/status/1699612869107572910?s=20" target="_blank">said around 9:30 p.m</a>. “No power outages associated with the ERCOT power grid were necessary.”</p><p>The event left unanswered questions, especially about what happened to energy supply. People are wondering why reserves dropped so quickly, and why the grid operator appeared to not see it coming.</p><p>But the one other, obvious, contributing factor was record-high energy demand due to a Texas heat wave that has begun to feel never-ending.  </p><p>"This is what happens when it is 97 degrees outside at ~8 pm," Michael Webber, a professor in UT Austin’s Department of Mechanical Engineering <a href="https://twitter.com/MichaelEWebber/status/1699585727967703466?s=20" target="_blank">tweeted</a>. "Demand at 8 pm this year is as high as our 5 pm peaks last year. Insane."</p><p><i>This is a developing story …</i><br></p>

<p>We are happy to announce that Arduino raised an additional $22 million round, taking our Series B funding to $54 million, thanks to an expansion co-led by CDP Venture Capital and Anzu Partners. Joining them is semiconductor leader Arm, following up on earlier investments.</p>
<p>CDP Venture Capital, Italy’s largest VC firm, invested through Large Ventures, launched in 2023 to support the scaling up of Italian global category leaders. “We are proud to support the dimensional leap of Arduino, a unique global excellence in the democratization of open-source hardware and software,” said Mario Branciforti, Head of CDP Venture Capital SGR’s Large Ventures fund.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the first <a href="https://blog.arduino.cc/2022/06/07/ready-to-transform-the-enterprise-world-we-are/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$32 million Series B financing received in 2022</a>, “<strong>This investment will allow us to further fuel our transformational platform initiative for professional customers, lowering the barriers to entry in IoT and AI by providing a continuum from hardware to Cloud</strong>,” says Arduino’s CEO Fabio Violante.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Want to know more about how the funds will be put to good use? A major chunk will be invested to further strengthen the R&amp;D team based in Turin, Italy, with the goal to grow enterprise application libraries and the Arduino Cloud for Business with more integrations and embedded AI features. Another consistent part is earmarked to help Arduino <strong>grow even more in the US</strong>, where we recently opened an office in Austin, TX and bolstered our presence in Chicago, IL. Finally, we will use the additional funds to <strong>accelerate go-to-market initiatives and customer support</strong> in selected areas.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Arduino came a long way from its humble beginning, becoming a powerful industrial tool used by cutting-edge organizations all over the world. I’m honored by this investment which is a further confirmation that our original formula keeps applying to new domains.”</p><cite>— Massimo Banzi, Arduino’s co-founder, chairman and CMO</cite></blockquote>
<p>This continued and expanding confidence from investors reflects the quality of the work we’ve been able to do, building a global company based on the strong values we share with every user in our amazing community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Jimmy Kan, Partner at Anzu Partners, “The enterprise ecosystem is on the cusp of a seismic transformation, driven by the convergence of efficient AI and IoT at the edge. Arduino stands at the heart of this revolution, and their commitment to innovation promises to redefine the industry norms.” Making technology accessible remains our mission, because <strong>the key to our success is empowering users</strong>: “Arduino supports an extensive community of developers who play a crucial role in accelerating the deployment of new computing solutions for IoT applications,” says Paul Williamson, senior vice president and general manager, IoT Line of Business at Arm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Amidst great change, we take our role as enablers of innovation seriously, and strive to leverage every resource we can access to <strong>expand our platform, keep up our forward momentum, and always enhance our service to you – so you can create the world we will live in</strong>.</p>

The state respects the cultural differences and lifestyles of ethnic groups, and ensures the equal rights of ethnic minorities in politics, economy, culture, language and folk customs, religious belief and other aspects, with coordinated measures. In 2013 China’s ethnic minorities and areas inhabited by ethnic minorities made new achievements and developments in various undertakings, and all ethnic minorities fully enjoyed and effectively exercised their basic rights. The political rights of ethnic minorities are fully guaranteed. Areas inhibited by ethnic minorities in compact communities exercising regional ethnic autonomy enjoy autonomous rights in a wide range of areas, including legislative power, flexibility in the execution of relevant state laws and regulations, the right to use their own spoken and written languages, personnel management power, financial management power, and the right of independently developing their special culture and education. The advantages of regional ethnic autonomy are best exemplified in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. Xinjiang is an ethnic autonomous area mainly inhibited by the Uyghur people. Autonomous organs at all levels in Xinjiang formulate and implement autonomous regulations, local rules and regulations, and legally binding decisions in light of their actual conditions, ensuring the autonomous rights of ethnic autonomous areas. All China’s 55 ethnic minority groups elect deputies to the NPC and members to the National Committee of the CPPCC. Ethnic minorities’ economic and social rights are fully protected.</p></blockquote><p><span>Never mind that </span><strong>none of this answers my actual question.</strong></p><p>Some final, if premature, observations:</p><ol><li><p><span>From the carefully neutral line on Myanmar to the boilerplate copy-pasting, it is clear that ERNIE tries its best to toe Beijing’s line. </span><strong>When approached directly, it’s not easy to get it to go off script, especially as it frequently shuts down conversations.</strong><span> Hypothetical prompting, however, can lead it to show new perspectives.

Intel will likely adopt ASML's High-NA tools for its post-18A process technologies, whereas its rivals from TSMC and Samsung will use them later in this decade. But those scanners are not going to be cheap.

<p>If you know us, you will know that we are the team behind <a href="https://github.com/Textualize/rich">Rich</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual">Textual</a> — two popular Python libraries that work magic in the terminal.</p>

<p>Today we are adding one project more to that lineup: <a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual-web">textual-web</a>.</p>
<!-- more -->

<p>Textual Web takes a Textual-powered TUI and turns it in to a web application.
Here's a video of that in action:</p>
<p>
<iframe width="auto" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A8k8TD7_wg0" title="Textual Web in action" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>

<p>With the <code>textual-web</code> command you can publish any Textual app on the web, making it available to anyone you send the URL to.
This works without creating a socket server on your machine, so you won't have to configure firewalls and ports to share your applications.</p>
<p>We're excited about the possibilities here.
Textual web apps are fast to spin up and tear down, and they can run just about anywhere that has an outgoing internet connection.
They can be built by a single developer without any experience with a traditional web stack.
All you need is proficiency in Python and a little time to read our <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/">lovely docs</a>.</p>
<p>Future releases will expose more of the Web platform APIs to Textual apps, such as notifications and file system access.
We plan to do this in a way that allows the same (Python) code to drive those features.
For instance, a Textual app might save a file to disk in a terminal, but offer to download it in the browser.</p>
<p>Also in the pipeline is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_app">PWA</a> support, so you can build terminal apps, web apps, and desktop apps with a single codebase.</p>
<p>Textual Web is currently in a public beta. Join our <a href="https://discord.gg/Enf6Z3qhVr">Discord server</a> if you would like to help us test, or if you have any questions.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Introduction</h2>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Welcome to snake-fury</strong>: the Haskell challenge for beginners. This challenge aims to provide a learning path for people willing to learn Haskell further than basic recursion exercises by implementing the snake game in Haskell. Snake-fury's pedagogical approach is based on two legs:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>snake-fury isn't a tutorial but a challenge.</li>
<li>snake-fury is focused on learning by refactoring, not by example.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The first leg means that you'll be asked to implement some functions/algorithms. It is expected that the challenger will be unable to implement them without some research on Hackage's documentation, blogs, youtube videos, etc. There will be guidelines to help the challenger. Nevertheless, an important skill when learning Haskell is to be able to search, read and understand the documentation that is (often, but not always) more complex and less accessible than other programming languages.</p>
<p dir="auto">The second leg is even more interesting. Haskell is notoriously known for its difficulty and the popularization of the holy triad: Functor - Applicative - Monad. There are plenty of tutorials showing examples and hundreds of thousands of lines trying to make them accessible and newcomer-friendly... But with all due respect, It seems they all fail to explain: "Why monads? Why not other less mathematical abstraction? Why not classic OOP patterns?". The approach given by snake-fury is to make the same application twice... it sounds crazy, but the idea goes like this: You'll implement a "pure" version of the snake game: No monads, no functors, no abstractions [<a href="#note-about-not-using-monads">see below</a>]. Then you will refactor the core application logic using the state and reader monads. Then you'll be asked to abstract your code and to use <code>mtl</code> classes to make your code less dependent on the concrete implementation.</p>
<p dir="auto">Below there is a dramatization of Haskell's learning curve. This challenge aims to be a helpful companion from the newby slope to the temple of oblivion... but be aware, nothing will save you from the temptation of abandon. Hopefully, you'll be able to climb up to the temple and spread the lambdas</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/lsmor/snake-fury/blob/main/assets/Haskell_learning_curve.png"><img src="https://github.com/lsmor/snake-fury/raw/main/assets/Haskell_learning_curve.png" alt="dramatization of Haskell's learning curve"></a></p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">note about not using monads</h3>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">By that I mean, not using do notation nor functor/applicative/monads combinators like <code>liftA2</code>, <code>fmap</code>, <code>&gt;&gt;=</code>, etc...
Obviously, The IO and the asynchronous part of the code are provided and the challenger is not expected to solve it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Start coding: Building a MVP</h2>
<p dir="auto">First you need access to a Haskell development environment. You can either:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Install it locally following the <a href="https://www.haskell.org/get-started/" rel="nofollow">official guide</a> (Recommended).</li>
<li>You can use gitpod to quickly jump into an <a href="https://www.gitpod.io/docs/introduction/getting-started" rel="nofollow">online environment</a>. Follow these considerations:
<ul dir="auto">
<li>You will need a fork of the repo in order to save your progress</li>
<li>If you are a <code>stack</code> user, modify the <code>hie.yaml</code> so the cradle is <code>stack</code> not <code>cabal</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Once you have a dev-env up and running, clone the code and move to <code>snake-fury-exercise</code> branch</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="git clone https://github.com/lsmor/snake-fury.git
git checkout snake-fury-exercise

# Optionally, you can create a solution branch out of this one
git checkout -b my-solution # (example name)"><pre>git clone https://github.com/lsmor/snake-fury.git
git checkout snake-fury-exercise

<span><span>#</span> Optionally, you can create a solution branch out of this one</span>
git checkout -b my-solution <span><span>#</span> (example name)</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">You should see this folder structure (among other files)</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="app

 |- GameState.hs       # (not implemented) here will go the logic of the game.
 |- RenderState.hs     # (not implemented) here will go the data structures for rendering the game
 |- Initialization.hs  # (implemented)     some utility functions"><pre>app
 <span>|</span>- Main.hs            <span><span>#</span> (implemented)     the entrypoint of your application.</span>

 <span>|</span>- Initialization.hs  <span><span>#</span> (implemented)     some utility functions</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Exercises are comments in the files:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>src/GameState.hs</code></li>
<li><code>src/RenderState.hs</code></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">They can be filled in any order.</p>
<p dir="auto">Each file correspond to each component in the system (and some utilities to keep code simpler). Be sure you read the <a href="#architecture">architecture</a> section to understand why the code is structured this way. Notice that you'll need to implement as many auxiliary functions as you need to make it work. If you feel stuck you can check the <a href="#solution-branches">solution</a> I've implemented.</p>
<p dir="auto">Once you complete all exercises in <code>GameState.hs</code> and <code>RenderState.hs</code> you should be able to run the snake game in a terminal with the command below.</p>

<p dir="auto">You've built a minimum viable product. Now it is time to improve it!. In the <code>exercises</code> folder you have intructions for refactoring. Follow them one by one as enumerated. One of the ideas is you feel the power of the type system when refactoring. Also you'll be dealing with poor design choices implemented in the mpv part.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>refactor-1</strong>: you will move from you mvp to a full snake game with all the functionality: like a score counter and increasing speed. Also, you'll deal with performance issue the mvp has.</li>
<li><strong>refactor-2</strong>: you will refactor the logic of the game to use the state monad. Hopefully you'll find code much easier to read.</li>
<li><strong>refactor-3</strong>: you will refactor the logic of the game to use the reader + state monad stack. Also, as an optional but recommended exercise, you can learn about the IO monad</li>
<li><strong>refactor-4</strong>: You will refactor the code to use <code>mtl</code> like constraints. Now the code looks a little bit abstract but it is easy to read and follow</li>
<li><strong>refactor-5</strong>: Finally, you'll refactor the code to be fully abstracted over the monad stack you use. You will create you own type classes expressing exactly the actions you want to execute.</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Solution branches</h2>
<p dir="auto">You have multiple solutions branches, one for each refactor step and one for the mvp. Below you have the relation of branches and refactors. You can run <code>git branch -l</code> to see the list of all branches.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>solution-mvp</code> branch corresponds to the solution of the first exercise</li>
<li><code>solution-refactor-1</code> branch corresponds to the solution of the first refactor in <a href="https://github.com/lsmor/snake-fury/blob/main/exercises/refactor-1.md">exercises/refactor-1</a></li>
<li><code>solution-refactor-2.1</code> branch corresponds to the solution of the second refactor, step 1 in <a href="https://github.com/lsmor/snake-fury/blob/main/exercises/refactor-2.md#step-1-apply-changes-locally">exercises/refactor-2</a></li>
<li><code>solution-refactor-2.2</code> branch corresponds to the solution of the second refactor, step 2 in <a href="https://github.com/lsmor/snake-fury/blob/main/exercises/refactor-2.md#step-2-did-you-spot-the-pattern-thats-a-monad">exercises/refactor-2</a></li>
<li><code>solution-refactor-3</code> branch corresponds to the solution of the third refactor in <a href="https://github.com/lsmor/snake-fury/blob/main/exercises/refactor-3.md">exercises/refactor-3</a></li>
<li><code>solution-refactor-4.1</code> branch corresponds to the solution of the fourth refactor, step 1 in <a href="https://github.com/lsmor/snake-fury/blob/main/exercises/refactor-4.md#step-1-mtl-constraints">exercises/refactor-4</a></li>
<li><code>solution-refactor-4.2</code> branch corresponds to the solution of the fourth refactor, step 2 in <a href="https://github.com/lsmor/snake-fury/blob/main/exercises/refactor-4.md#step-2-glue-together-renderstate-and-gamestate">exercises/refactor-4</a></li>
<li><code>solution-refactor-5</code> branch corresponds to the solution of the fifth refactor in <a href="https://github.com/lsmor/snake-fury/blob/main/exercises/refactor-5.md">exercises/refactor-5</a></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">My solution might be different than yours, and that is totally fine. All solution branches should build and run the same as your exercise branch.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">note 1: <code>main</code> branch is unstable an you shouldn't build it. Contains all sort of experiments, including an heavy sdl front-end</p>
<p dir="auto">note 2: At the moment, the <code>main</code> branch doesn't use frames per second but microseconds as input parameter. Hence <code>cabal run snake-fury -- 10 10 100000</code> will run at 10 fps. In the exercise branch, the input parameter is correct. So if you want to build from <code>main</code> be aware of this change.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Architecture</h2>
<p dir="auto">The general architecture of the software is the following:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>There are three major components:
<ul dir="auto">
<li>An <em>Event Queue</em>: It keeps a queue of the following events to happen in the game based on the user keyboard input</li>
<li>A <em>Game State</em>: Is the logic state. It keeps track on the snake body, the current apple, the direction of movement, etc...</li>
<li>A <em>Render State</em>: Is the game board. Instead of building up the board from the GameState, we keep an array in memory and modify it as convenient</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Each compoment sends a message to the next one in the following order: <code>(user keyboard) -&gt; EventQueue -&gt; GameState -&gt; RenderState -&gt; (render device)</code></li>
<li>We have two threads:
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The secondary thread is continuously reading from user's keyboard and pushing the key strokes into an asynchronous <code>EventQueue</code></li>
<li>The main thread reads at steady time from the <code>EventQueue</code>, and based on what the user has pressed, it runs the game logic and prints the board in the console</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Notice that two threads are necessary, since user could press keys faster than the game updates (fps). For example let say we run a frame each second and a half (normal speed in the snake game), then a user is likely to press keys faster than that. If the key strokes are catched only when a frame is about to be rendered, then many strokes will be lost.</p>
<p dir="auto">The following diagram helps to visualize</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/lsmor/snake-fury/blob/main/assets/snake_architecture.png"><img src="https://github.com/lsmor/snake-fury/raw/main/assets/snake_architecture.png" alt="Overview of the architecture"></a></p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Contributions and Feedback</h2>
<p dir="auto">Please, open an issue if you:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>find some solution branch doesn't build. Typically this is due to some external dependencies not available or an error with <code>cabal</code>. Add label <em>solution branch does not build</em> to the issue</li>
<li>If you think the README or any of the exercises is poorly written, or could be improved substantially. Add label <em>documentation</em> to the issue</li>
<li>If the software builds but it missbehaves. For example, the snake doesn't move, or the board looks wrong. Add label <em>bug</em> to the issue</li>
<li>If you want to provide some feedback (see below). Add label <em>feedback</em> to the issue.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">If you want to contribute with a PR, take into account that due to the refactoring nature of the challenge, there are many branches. This makes integration difficult but you should follow these two rules:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Documentation</strong> should be merge into <code>main</code> branch. This rule apply to README, any markdown under <code>exercises</code>, and any file in the <code>assets</code> folder</li>
<li><strong>Code</strong> should be merge into <code>solution-mvp</code> if the change applies to all refactors; Or merge into <code>solution-refactor-XXX</code> if the change applies only to that refactor, hence you should branch out from the corresponding branch. Any change done in <code>solution-mvp</code> is merge into <code>snake-fury-exercise</code> and <code>solution-refactor-XXX</code>.</li>
<li>If you aren't sure how to contribute, just ask :)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The branch graph look like:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="main

             |-solution-refactor-4.2
               |-solution-refactor-5</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Also I'd appreciate if you write some feedback for me. As already said, open an issue with a label <em>feedback</em>. These issue won't be closed, as it is easier for someone comming to the challenge to filter by open issues with label <em>feedback</em>, rather than closed issues. Please, do not use the <em>feedback</em> issue for any other than providing feedback, so if you have an idea on how to improve the challenge open a second issue with your proposal. Ideally <em>feedback</em> issue will have a maximum of two comments: the feedback itself, and a second comment in case the issue is outdated due to changes.  Avoid meaningless feeback if possible.</p>
<p dir="auto">Positive feedback should answer these questions:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>How much Haskell did you know before starting the challenge?</li>
<li>Does the project helped you with some concepts more than other resources?</li>
<li>In your opinion, What's the most difficult part?</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Negative feedback (is welcome) should answer these questions:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>How much Haskell did you know before starting the challenge?</li>
<li>How much of the project have you completed?</li>
<li>How can I improve the challenge?</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Here are some examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Wrong positive feedback</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">This challenge is cool!</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Right positive feedback</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">This challenge is cool!. I learnt some Haskell a year ago but could not build anything usefull with it (so I was in the valley of frustration and abandom the language). Monads are much clearer now, I am still wrapping my head around mtl style, but sure I will get it!!.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Wrong negative feedback</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">This challenge is worthless</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Right negative feedback</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">This challenge is worthless. I've being learning Haskell for the last 6 months and still I am unable to build anything usefull. Building the mpv is doable (but very difficult), but when you start with the first refactor you end up touching the f**** IO monad and using ByteString/Builder. Why on earth Haskell hasn't a good default string library??.</p>
<p dir="auto">This challenge should make an effort to explain all the inconviniences newcommers should face when getting into the language.</p>

            <pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2023 10:21:44 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/07/uk_government_clause_online_safety_bill/">https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/07/uk_government_clause_online_safety_bill/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37416909">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>Comment</span> Sanity appears to have prevailed in the debate over the UK Online Safety bill after the government agreed to ditch proposals - at least for the time being - to legislate the scanning of encrypted messages.</p>
<p>In response to questions regarding the technical feasibility of scanning messages and the assessments that Ofcom must make, Lord Parkinson, a Digital, Culture, Media and Sport minister, <a target="_blank" href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2023-09-06/debates/4AC6A32E-0C53-46C7-A714-AD4165C484D7/OnlineSafetyBill">said</a>: "If the appropriate technology does not exist that meets these requirements, then Ofcom will not be able to use Clause 122 to require its use."</p>
<p>Clause 122 in the Online Safety Bill relates to online terrorism and child exploitation content.</p>

    

<p>Parkinson said: "A notice can be issued only where technically feasible and where technology has been accredited as meeting minimum standards of accuracy."</p>

        


        

<p>Thus no scanning of encrypted messages unless it is technically feasible to do so. Quantum computing, anyone?</p>
<h3>Victory? Not so fast...</h3>
<p>The statements have been widely interpreted as a victory for technology firms, many of which had <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/04/28/online_safety_bill_age_checks/">threatened</a> to exit the UK over the requirement that it must be possible for encrypted messages to be scanned for illegal content.</p>
<p>However, it could also be argued that the changes only represent the bare minimum needed to get the bill across the line. The controversial clauses remain largely in place, with the buck passed to future administrations, or to when reading the messages becomes "technically feasible."</p>
<p>Matthew Hodgson, CEO of Element, said: "The government saying 'no scanning until it's technically feasible' is nonsense. Scanning is fundamentally incompatible with end-to-end encrypted messaging apps. Scanning bypasses the encryption in order to scan, exposing your messages to attackers."</p>

        

<p>He told <i>The Register</i> that the statement and the reaction from some section of the tech community left him terrified. “It’s not a win at all,” he said.</p>
<p>Hodgson continued: “the ministers must be feeling utterly smug… the pressure has been removed from them to change the bill and stop scanning, and they didn’t have to do anything”</p>
<p>“It's terrible because the law still says that scanning can be obligated on encrypted messaging providers, it would still undermine end to end encryption. And all it is [doing] is pushing it slightly down the line until somebody decides it's technically feasible, which is a completely subjective thing.”</p>

        

<p>Martina Larkin, CEO of Project Liberty, queried the thinking behind the clause and said: "No one is questioning that more must be done to protect people, especially children, online. However the debate should not be about protecting children versus protecting privacy. We can have, and should have, both."</p>
<p>"When it comes to how we build a better web, everybody loses when rash decisions are made. Trying to protect children by building backdoors into encryption will have unprecedented negative consequences for online privacy, the use of people's data as well as the protection of free speech and democratic values. No one would ever willingly let a complete stranger read all of your mail, put cameras in their house, and follow their every move. So why do it online?"</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/29/apple_online_safety_bill_opposition/">Now Apple takes a bite out of encryption-bypassing 'spy clause' in UK internet law</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/04/18/wrong_time_to_weaken_encryption/">Wrong time to weaken encryption, UK IT chartered institute tells government</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/04/28/online_safety_bill_age_checks/">Online Safety Bill age checks? We won't do 'em, says Wikipedia</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/04/21/meta_encryption_police/">International cops urge Meta <em>not</em> to implement secure encryption for all</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We'll draw a discreet veil over the devices with potential for surveillance supplied by large technology companies that people have indeed cheerfully installed in their houses. Still, both Larkin and Hodgson make excellent points.</p>
<p>A spokesperson from Index on Censorship said: "The Online Safety Bill as currently drafted is still a threat to encryption and as such puts at risk everyone from journalists working with whistleblowers to ordinary citizens talking in private. We need to see amendments urgently to protect our right to free speech online."</p>
<p>Attempts to paint the UK government's apparent climbdown as a victory for big tech is missing the point. At best, a skirmish might have been won and a ceasefire temporarily declared. However, the larger battle over privacy and encryption on the internet has yet to be fought. ®</p>

<p>Apple has acquired 50-year-old record label BIS Records, the Swedish company's founder, Robert von Bahr, <a href="https://www.bis.se/">announced</a> Tuesday. The purchase of the classical music-focused label follows Apple's late March launch of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/03/apple-will-launch-a-new-app-exclusively-for-classical-music-later-this-month/">Apple Music Classical</a> app.</p>
<p>Apple's BIS purchase adds to the app, which in March Apple called the "world's largest classical music catalogue" with "over" 5 million tracks. Von Bahr said the record label will be incorporated into the Apple Music Classical app and Platoon. Apple bought <a href="https://www.platoon.ai/">Platoon</a>, which identifies new talent and helps creators make, distribute, and market their content, in 2018. Von Bahr noted his just turning 80 as part of the decision to sell. He also pointed to his interest in Apple's support for spatial audio and in bringing "classical music to new audiences all over the world."</p>
<p>Neither Apple nor BIS disclosed the price of the acquisition. However, von Bahr said that he and the rest of the BIS staff will be "retained" by Apple.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The acquisition is another step in Apple's efforts to target classical music as it seeks to differentiate its streaming platform. Classical music still represents a drop in the massive bucket of on-demand music streaming. Data from data analytics firm <a href="https://luminatedata.com/blog/concerto-more-like-concert-oh/">Luminate</a> and cited by <a href="https://www.billboard.com/pro/apple-music-classical-app-good-streaming-business/">Billboard</a> in March found that classical music represented 0.8 percent of on-demand streams in the US in 2022. However, the data firm also <a href="https://luminatedata.com/blog/concerto-more-like-concert-oh/">said</a> in June that the classical music genre outpaced total US on-demand streaming growth in 2022 (13.4 percent year over year versus 12.2 percent year over year, respectively).</p>

<p>Apple launched Apple Music Classical as a separate app from <a href="https://howl.me/ckwW0tvIk7q" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple Music</a> on March 28. Building upon Apple's 2018 acquisition of <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/primephonic-wants-to-save-classical-music-1-stream-at-a-time">Primephonic</a>, Apple Music Classical allows various search parameters related to classical works, from song title and composer, to conductor and orchestra names, soloist performers, and more. Additional features include composer biographies and deep-dives on famous works. Since its release, Apple Music Classical has added support for devices running Android 9 Pie and later.</p>
<p>Apple didn't respond to questions seeking clarification on how Apple Music Classical artists get paid and if it differs from payments for Apple Music artists. <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/apple-music-classical">PCMag</a> in March suggested that the classical music app pays per stream, as Apple Music does. However, that wouldn't benefit older classical works. With its BIS acquisition, Apple may gain insight into how to navigate the financial side of classical music.</p>

</h2>
<p dir="auto">exa is written in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" rel="nofollow">Rust</a>.
You will need rustc version 1.66.1 or higher.
The recommended way to install Rust for development is from the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install" rel="nofollow">official download page</a>, using rustup.</p>
<p dir="auto">Once Rust is installed, you can compile exa with Cargo:</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">The <a href="https://github.com/casey/just">just</a> command runner can be used to run some helpful development commands, in a manner similar to <code>make</code>.
Run <code>just --list</code> to get an overview of what’s available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">If you are compiling a copy for yourself, be sure to run <code>cargo build --release</code> or <code>just build-release</code> to benefit from release-mode optimisations.
Copy the resulting binary, which will be in the <code>target/release</code> directory, into a folder in your <code>$PATH</code>.
<code>/usr/local/bin</code> is usually a good choice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">To compile and install the manual pages, you will need <a href="https://pandoc.org/" rel="nofollow">pandoc</a>.
The <code>just man</code> command will compile the Markdown into manual pages, which it will place in the <code>target/man</code> directory.
To use them, copy them into a directory that <code>man</code> will read.
<code>/usr/local/share/man</code> is usually a good choice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">exa depends on <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/git2-rs">libgit2</a> for certain features.
If you’re unable to compile libgit2, you can opt out of Git support by running <code>cargo build --no-default-features</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">If you intend to compile for musl, you will need to use the flag <code>vendored-openssl</code> if you want to get the Git feature working.
The full command is <code>cargo build --release --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-musl --features vendored-openssl,git</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">For more information, see the <a href="https://the.exa.website/install/source" rel="nofollow">Building from Source page</a>.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Testing with Vagrant</h3>
<p dir="auto">exa uses <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/" rel="nofollow">Vagrant</a> to configure virtual machines for testing.</p>
<p dir="auto">Programs such as exa that are basically interfaces to the system are <a href="https://eev.ee/blog/2016/08/22/testing-for-people-who-hate-testing/#troublesome-cases" rel="nofollow">notoriously difficult to test</a>.
Although the internal components have unit tests, it’s impossible to do a complete end-to-end test without mandating the current user’s name, the time zone, the locale, and directory structure to test.
(And yes, these tests are worth doing. I have missed an edge case on many an occasion.)</p>
<p dir="auto">The initial attempt to solve the problem was just to create a directory of “awkward” test cases, run exa on it, and make sure it produced the correct output.
But even this output would change if, say, the user’s locale formats dates in a different way.
These can be mocked inside the code, but at the cost of making that code more complicated to read and understand.</p>
<p dir="auto">An alternative solution is to fake <em>everything</em>: create a virtual machine with a known state and run the tests on <em>that</em>.
This is what Vagrant does.
Although it takes a while to download and set up, it gives everyone the same development environment to test for any obvious regressions.</p>
<p dir="auto">First, initialise the VM:</p>

<p dir="auto">The first command downloads the virtual machine image, and then runs our provisioning script, which installs Rust and exa’s build-time dependencies, configures the environment, and generates some awkward files and folders to use as test cases.
Once this is done, you can SSH in, and build and test:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="host$ vagrant ssh
vm$ cd /vagrant
vm$ cargo build
vm$ ./xtests/run
All the tests passed!"><pre><code>host$ vagrant ssh
vm$ cd /vagrant
vm$ cargo build
vm$ ./xtests/run
All the tests passed!
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Of course, the drawback of having a standard development environment is that you stop noticing bugs that occur outside of it.
For this reason, Vagrant isn’t a <em>necessary</em> development step — it’s there if you’d like to use it, but exa still gets used and tested on other platforms.
It can still be built and compiled on any target triple that it supports, VM or no VM, with <code>cargo build</code> and <code>cargo test</code>.</p>

    Someone keeps trying to reset my facebook password.   I keep getting these "account recovery code" emails.  They're legit.
  </p><p>
    Whoever is doing apparently doesn't have access to my email, though, as  they keep doing it and when I check logins, I only see the devices that I have with me logged in.
  </p><p>
    Is there a way I can find out who is doing this?   Or at least get an IP address of the login attempts
  </p><p>
    I want to know if this is really someone trying to steal my account, or if it's just a Facebook-connected app that I have exhibiting some kind of bizarre bug.
  </p><p>
    I've already turned on 2FA (already had it on before this, but only with text messages, I added the Authenticator app as well)
  </p><p>
    I also went ahead and actually changed my password (NOT a password reset, changed it from within account settings) , just because good security practices.
  </p><p>
    It's annoying that this is happening, but since the security measures I already had in place have defeated these attempts,  not dire.   Still, really annoying.
  </p><p>
    I've tried searching for a way to disable password reset attempts,  but the Facebook article about it just redirects back to itself.
  </p><p>
    .
  </p><p>
    Anyone have any insights?  A way to stop this?    I don't just want to mark the reset emails as spam, what if I really need to reset my password at some point?

<p>After 3 years, the new world record was set by installing LoRaWAN trackers on a fishing boat <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.vesselfinder.com/?imo=8797219">Estrela de Sesimbra</a> and on its buoys on the Sesimbra coast, Portugal. The tracker was able to make contact with a gateway in the Canarian Islands. Three messages have been received by the <em>“cablpa-pitilleros”</em> gateway connected to The Things Stack Community Edition.</p>

<p>Nuno Cruz reports that the trackers were installed by the team of the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://custodian.solvit.pt/">Custodian project</a> which is lead by <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.solvit.pt/">Solvit </a>and includes <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://fit.isel.pt/">FIT</a>/<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.isel.pt/">ISEL</a> (where Nuno Cruz is a researcher), <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.aircentre.org/">AirCentre DOCAPESCA</a>, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://lotacor.pt/">LOTAÇOR</a>, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.ntnu.edu/">NTNU</a>, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.uavision.com/">UAVISION</a> and <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://terinovazores.pt/">TERINOV</a>.

<p>The remarkable point of this record is that it is achieved at sea level. Reaching extended distances with LoRaWAN at sea level eliminates potential variables introduced by varying altitudes, providing a standardized and objective measure of the technology's capabilities. We do have to note that this is an exceptional achievement. The majority of The Things Stack-operated devices range between 25 and 100 meters (75-300 feet) from the gateway.</p>

Coupled with security controls like sandboxing, we continue to make it increasingly difficult for attackers to reach their objectives by exploiting third-party dependencies.</p>
<p>One such dependency Canva uses is <a target="_new" href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/librsvg">librsvg</a> (via <a target="_new" href="https://www.libvips.org/">libvips</a>). We use librsvg to quickly render user-provided SVGs into thumbnails later displayed as PNGs. By exploiting differences in URL parsers when rendering an SVG with librsvg, we showed it's possible to include arbitrary files from disk in the resulting image. The <a target="_new" href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/librsvg/-/issues/996">librsvg maintainers quickly patched the issue</a> and issued a security vulnerability (<a target="_new" href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-38633">CVE-2023-38633</a>).</p>
<p>We're sharing this research as another example of the <a target="_new" href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2022/01/10/dont-mix-url-parsers/">dangers of mixing URL parsers</a>, especially because the example we discovered is very subtle.</p>
<p>A special thanks to Federico (librsvg maintainer), John (libvips maintainer), and Lovell (<a target="_new" href="https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/">Sharp</a> maintainer) for their work and excellent coordinated response.</p>
<h2 id="prequel">Prequel</h2>
<p>The <a target="_new" href="https://github.com/elttam/publications/blob/master/writeups/inkscape-xml.md">XML Parsing Issues in Inkscape in CLI</a> write-up from Elttam's Victor Kahan shows how Inkscape is vulnerable to path traversal when rendering SVGs. Extending Victor's research, we found that while XInclude wasn't directly supported in Inkscape 0.9, it exhibited some interesting behavior when an SVG was nested in another SVG.</p>
<p>For example, consider the following inner SVG.</p>
<pre><p><span>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>&lt;</span><span>svg</span><span> </span><span>width</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>300</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>height</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>300</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>xmlns:</span><span>xi</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>&lt;</span><span>rect</span><span> </span><span>width</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>300</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>height</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>300</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>style</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>fill:rgb(255,204,204);</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>/&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>&lt;</span><span>text</span><span> </span><span>x</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>0</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>y</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>100</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>xi:</span><span>include</span><span> </span><span>href</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>/etc/passwd</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>parse</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>text</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>encoding</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>ASCII</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>&lt;</span><span>xi:</span><span>fallback</span><span>&gt;</span><span>file not found</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>xi:</span><span>fallback</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>xi:</span><span>include</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>text</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>&lt;/</span><span>svg</span><span>&gt;</span></p></pre>

<p>When run with Inkscape 0.92.4, it produced an image where the XInclude fallback was triggered.</p>
<pre><p><span>$ inkscape </span><span>-f</span><span> test.svg </span><span>-e</span><span> out.png </span><span>-w</span><span> </span><span>300</span></p></pre>
<p><span><span></span><img alt="File not found" loading="lazy" width="300" height="300" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://www.canva.dev/_next/static/media/file-not-found.82e8094e.png"><span></span></span></p>
<p>The fact that Xinclude was supported at all was surprising because it can often lead to security vulnerabilities. While Inkscape isn't used by the Canva product, <a target="_new" href="https://gitlab.com/inkscape/inkscape/-/blob/0.92.x/src/display/cairo-utils.cpp#L230">digging into the Inkscape code path</a> showed that nested images are loaded with <a target="_new" href="https://docs.gtk.org/gdk-pixbuf/">GdkPixbuf</a>, which itself delegates SVG loading to <a target="_new" href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/librsvg">librsvg</a>. This was of great interest because librsvg is something that Canva <em>does</em> use.</p>
<h2 id="xinclude">XInclude</h2>
<p><a target="_new" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude/">XInclude</a> is a mechanism for merging XML documents, which can lead to security vulnerabilities when a user-provided XML document (like an SVG) is assembled or rendered on a server.</p>
<p><span><span></span><img alt="Xinclude example" loading="lazy" width="935" height="335" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://www.canva.dev/_next/static/media/lfi.3ef943bb.png"><span></span></span></p>
<p>There are two standout elements in XInclude:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude/#include_element"><code>xi:include</code></a> to include contents of a referenced URL, such as a file or HTTP request. The content being included can be plaintext or XML.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude/#fallback_element"><code>xi:fallback</code></a> to nominate content that should be rendered when the referenced content can't be loaded by <code>xi:Include</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Security checks aside, the following XML document loads the contents of <code>/etc/passwd</code> when processed.</p>
<pre><p><span>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>&lt;</span><span>example</span><span> </span><span>xmlns:</span><span>xi</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>&lt;</span><span>xi:</span><span>include</span><span> </span><span>href</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>/etc/passwd</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>parse</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>text</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>encoding</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>ASCII</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>xi:</span><span>fallback</span><span>&gt;</span><span>file not found</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>xi:</span><span>fallback</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>xi:</span><span>include</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>&lt;/</span><span>example</span><span>&gt;</span></p></pre>
<h2 id="there-are-rules">There are rules</h2>
<p>librsvg is a Rust library to render SVG images to <a target="_new" href="https://www.cairographics.org/">Cairo</a> surfaces. Most of the heavy lifting is now implemented in Rust, but the library relies on the Cairo and GNOME glib C libraries.</p>
<p><span><span></span><img alt="Librsvg overview" loading="lazy" width="697" height="311" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://www.canva.dev/_next/static/media/librsvg.e1b01ae7.png"><span></span></span></p>
<p>From the prequel, we knew librsvg supported at least some of the XInclude standards. To understand how much, <a target="_new" href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/librsvg/-/tree/eec9d15145da5f6e2b70c5974b3e3c6ecac876e0">we dug into its implementation</a>. As it turns out, every external URL reference in an SVG passes through a single method for validation. This includes references such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;image href="file:///something.png" /&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>&lt;rect filter="url('file-with-filters.svg#my_filter')" /&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>&lt;xi:include href="/etc/passwd" ... /&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The librsvg <a target="_new" href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/librsvg/-/blob/eec9d15145da5f6e2b70c5974b3e3c6ecac876e0/rsvg/src/url_resolver.rs#L32">url_resolver.resolve_href</a> method implements some <a target="_new" href="https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/librsvg/Rsvg-2.0/class.Handle.html#security-and-locations-of-referenced-files">strict security checks</a> to restrict what references can be loaded when processing an SVG document:</p>
<ul>
<li>All <code>data:</code> URLs are permitted because they can't reference external files by design.</li>
<li>The referenced scheme must match the "current document" scheme. For example, when processing <code>file:///foo/bar/example.svg</code>, any encountered URL must be of the <code>file:</code> scheme.</li>
<li>Encountered files must be in the same directory as the current document, or within a subdirectory of the current document. This is enforced by <a target="_new" href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/librsvg/-/blob/eec9d15145da5f6e2b70c5974b3e3c6ecac876e0/rsvg/src/url_resolver.rs#L68-85">checking the URL path</a>.</li>
<li>All other schemes are rejected, including <code>http:</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These strict rules are the reason our earlier naive XInclude tests failed. But we were very interested to see if we could bypass the rules. This could result in path traversal when processing an SVG, for example, being able to include files like <code>/etc/passwd</code> in the contents of the rendered SVG to PNG.</p>
<h2 id="parser-mismatch">Parser Mismatch</h2>
<p>Resolving a URL within an SVG document has two steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Validate the URL as per the resolve rules mentioned earlier.</li>
<li>If successful, <a target="_new" href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/librsvg/-/blob/eec9d15145da5f6e2b70c5974b3e3c6ecac876e0/rsvg/src/io.rs#L87">load the contents</a>, which parses URLs using <a target="_new" href="https://docs.gtk.org/gio/">Gio</a>'s inbuilt URI parser.</li>
</ol>

<p>Knowing there were two URL parsers at play (one to validate the URL and one to load the contents), to bypass the security checks, we needed to find URLs where the parsers disagreed.</p>
<p>With some quick tests, we mapped out how the URL parsers process different URLs.</p>

<p><a target="_new" href="https://docs.gtk.org/gio/">Gio</a> doesn't expose generic URL parsing (aside from GUri, which isn't on the callpath). But <code>g_filename_from_uri</code> returns on some examples.</p>

<h2 id="bypassing-validation">Bypassing Validation</h2>
<p>Given this understanding of where the URL parsers were at, we took the relevant parts from librsvg and set up a fuzzing harness ("resolve") to run the same logic as the resolve URL logic when encountering a reference (href, XInclude, etc.) from an on-disk "current.svg" file. This allowed us to quickly test and fuzz inputs to see how the parsers and validation logic were evaluated. Some interesting outputs from fuzzing were as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>resolve 'current.svg'</code>: Passes as expected.</li>
<li><code>resolve run '../../../../../../../etc/passwd'</code>: Canonicalization fails with 'No such file or directory'.</li>
<li><code>resolve 'current.svg?../../../../../../../etc/passwd'</code>: Passes.</li>
<li><code>resolve 'none/../current.svg'</code>: Passes as expected.</li>
</ul>
<p>The last 2 results showed us that <code>GFile::for_uri</code> happily resolves path traversals, including path traversals in the query string. However, the second result, <code>../../../../../../../etc/passwd</code>, failed because of the canonicalization check.</p>
<h3 id="bypassing-canonicalization">Bypassing Canonicalization</h3>
<p>Part of librsvg's URL validation is to canonicalize the built URL to replace .. and . segments per regular filesystem path rules. It does this using Rust's <a target="_new" href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fs/fn.canonicalize.html">std::fs::canonicalize</a> (calling <a target="_new" href="https://linux.die.net/man/3/realpath">realpath</a>), which throws an error if:</p>
<ul>
<li>The path doesn't exist.</li>
<li>A non-final component in the path isn't a directory.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because we don't always know the name of the 'current' SVG on disk, we needed to bypass canonicalization if we wanted to have a URL pass librsvg's validation. After some rapid testing, it turns out this is relatively straightforward.</p>
<pre><p><span>$ realpath current.svg</span></p><p><span>/home/zsims/projects/librsvg-poc/current.svg</span></p><p><span>$ realpath </span><span>.</span><span></span></p><p><span>/home/zsims/projects/librsvg-poc/</span></p></pre>
<p>As it turns out, <code>realpath(".")</code> and <code>std::fs::canonicalize(".")</code> both return the "current directory". We can use this as a placeholder in our PoC instead of <code>current.svg</code>.</p>
<h2 id="proof-of-concept">Proof of concept</h2>
<p>Knowing how the URL parsers mismatch, and how we can bypass canonicalization without knowing the current file name, we can build a payload to include <code>/etc/passwd</code>.</p>
<pre><p><span>.?../../../../../../../etc/passwd</span></p></pre>
<p>Within a <code>poc.svg</code> SVG, this looks like the following.</p>
<pre><p><span>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>&lt;</span><span>svg</span><span> </span><span>width</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>300</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>height</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>300</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>xmlns:</span><span>xi</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>&lt;</span><span>rect</span><span> </span><span>width</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>300</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>height</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>300</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>style</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>fill:rgb(255,204,204);</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>/&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>&lt;</span><span>text</span><span> </span><span>x</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>0</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>y</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>100</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>xi:</span><span>include</span><span> </span><span>href</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>.?../../../../../../../etc/passwd</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>parse</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>text</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>encoding</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>ASCII</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>&lt;</span><span>xi:</span><span>fallback</span><span>&gt;</span><span>file not found</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>xi:</span><span>fallback</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>xi:</span><span>include</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>text</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>&lt;/</span><span>svg</span><span>&gt;</span></p></pre>
<p>And produces the following result.</p>
<pre><p><span>$ rsvg-convert poc.svg &gt; poc.png</span></p></pre>
<p><span><span></span><img alt="Proof of concept" loading="lazy" width="300" height="300" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://www.canva.dev/_next/static/media/poc.19965e7b.png"><span></span></span></p>
<p>We get a similar result when running through vipsthumbnail.</p>

<p>Note that this PoC only works where the SVG is loaded from a <code>file://</code>. SVGs loaded through <code>data:</code> or <code>resource:</code> schemes are not vulnerable.</p>
<h2 id="patch">Patch</h2>
<p>Following the report to librsvg's maintainer (see <a target="_new" href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/librsvg/-/issues/996">Issue 996</a>), Federico <a target="_new" href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/librsvg/-/merge_requests/861">patched the issue</a> to add improved URL validation and use the validated URL as input into GFile. Part of the response from Federico included a heads-up to maintainers of Sharp and libvips to upgrade before the issue was disclosed publicly as <a target="_new" href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-38633">CVE-2023-38633</a>.</p>
<p>The issue also prompted some discussion about <a target="_new" href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/issues/3050">file URL parsing in glib</a>, resulting in some <a target="_new" href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/merge_requests/3502">additional validation</a> in the library.</p>
<p>There were a few standouts from discovery and patching:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a target="_new" href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2022/01/10/dont-mix-url-parsers/">dangers of mixing URL parsers</a> are just as applicable to <code>file://</code> URLs and in-process use as they are for networked services and <code>http://</code> URLs.</li>
<li><code>file://</code> URLs are special. For example, the URL specification highlights <a target="_new" href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#file-state">support for query strings in <code>file://</code></a> URLs,&nbsp;but the support in the implementations we reviewed varied greatly.</li>
<li>Efforts to migrate existing C code to Rust are not without risk. Although memory safety is much improved, differences in contracts (like URL parsing) can have negative security consequences.</li>
<li>Make sure you're only parsing URLs once, and using that parsed value from that point onwards.</li>
<li>If possible, enforce your own validation on files, like SVGs, before processing further. This is the reason <a target="_new" href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki">MediaWiki</a> is not impacted by this issue because <code>xi:include</code> elements are rejected before the SVG reaches librsvg.</li>

    <p>SIGGRAPH 2023 just had a paper “<a href="https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/"><strong>3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Radiance Field Rendering</strong></a>”
by Kerbl, Kopanas, Leimkühler, Drettakis, and it looks
pretty cool! Check out their website, source code repository, data sets and so on (I should note that
it is <em>really, really good</em> to see full source and full data sets being released. Way to go!).</p>
<p>I’ve decided to try to implement the realtime visualization part (i.e. the one that takes
already-produced gaussian splat “model” file) in Unity. As well as maybe play around with looking at
whether the data sizes could be made smaller (maybe use some of the learnings from
<a href="https://aras-p.info/blog/2023/01/29/Float-Compression-0-Intro/">float compression series</a> too?).</p>
<p><a href="https://aras-p.info/img/blog/2023/gaussian-splat/gs-bike-initial.jpg"><img src="https://aras-p.info/img/blog/2023/gaussian-splat/gs-bike-initial.jpg" title="" alt="" width="300px"></a>
<em>What’s a few million badly rendered boxes among friends, anyway?</em></p>
<p>For the impatient: I got <em>something</em> working over at <a href="https://github.com/aras-p/UnityGaussianSplatting">aras-p/UnityGaussianSplatting</a>, and will tinker with things there some more.</p>
<p><em>Meanwhile, some quick random thoughts on this Gaussian Splatting thing.</em></p>
<h4 id="what-are-these-gaussian-splats">What are these Gaussian Splats?</h4>
<p>Watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_kXY43VZnk"><strong>paper video</strong></a> and read
<a href="https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/">the paper</a>, they are pretty good!</p>

<p>
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T_kXY43VZnk" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</p>

<p>I have seen quite many 3rd party explanations of the concept at this point, and some of them, uhh, get a thing or
two wrong about it :)</p>
<ul>
<li>This is <em><strong>not</strong></em> a NeRF (Neural Radiance Field)! There is absolutely nothing “neural” about it.</li>
<li>It is <em><strong>not</strong></em> somehow “fast, because it uses GPU rasterization hardware”. The official implementation does not
use the rasterization pipeline at all; it is 100% done with CUDA. In fact, it is fast <em>because</em> it does not use
the fixed function rasterization, as we’ll see below.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Anyway,</em></p>
<p>Gaussian Splats are, basically, “<strong>a bunch of blobs in space</strong>”. Instead of representing a 3D scene as
polygonal meshes, or voxels, or distance fields, it represents it as (millions of) particles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each particle (“a 3D Gaussian”) has position, rotation and a non-uniform scale in 3D space.</li>
<li>Each particle also has an opacity, as well as color (actually, not a single color, but rather
3rd order Spherical Harmonics coefficients - meaning “the color” can change depending on the view direction).</li>
<li>For rendering, the particles are rendered (“splatted”) as <em>2D Gaussians</em> in screen space, i.e. they
are <em>not</em> rendered as scaled elongated spheres, actually! More on this below.</li>
</ul>
<p>And <em>that’s it</em>. The “Gaussian Splatting” scene representation is <em>just that</em>, a whole bunch of scaled and colored
blobs in space. The genius part of the paper is several things:</p>
<ul>
<li>They found a way <strong>how</strong> to create these millions of blobs that would represent a scene depicted by a bunch of
photos. This is using gradient descent and “differentiable rendering” and all the other things that are way
over my head. This <em>feels</em> like the major contribution, like maybe previously people assumed that in order
for gradient descent optimizer to work nicely, you need to use a continuous or connected scene representation (vs
“just a bunch of blobs”), and this paper proved that wrong? <em>Anyway, I don’t understand this area, so I won’t talk
about it more :)</em></li>
<li>They have developed a fast way to render all these millions of scaled particles. This by itself is not particularly
ground breaking IMHO, various people have noticed that using something like a tile-based “software, but on GPU”
rasterizer is a good way to do this.</li>
<li>They have combined existing established approaches (like gaussian splatting, and spherical harmonics)
in a nice way.</li>
<li>And finally, they have resisted the temptation to do “neural” anything ;)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="previous-building-blocks">Previous Building Blocks</h4>
<p>The <strong>Gaussian Splatting</strong> seems to be invented around year 2001-2002, see for example “<a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~zwicker/publications/EWASplatting-TVCG02.pdf">EWA Splatting</a>” paper by Zwicker, Pfister, Van Baar, Gross.
There they have scaled and oriented “blobs” in space, calculate how would they project onto screen, and then
do the actual “blob shape” (a “Gaussian”) in 2D, in screen-space. A bunch of signal processing, sampling, aliasing etc.
math presumably supports doing it that way.</p>
<p>Speaking of ellipsoids, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnOXk3QJWN8">Ecstatica game</a> from 1994 had a fairly
unique ellipsoid-based renderer.</p>
<p><strong>Spherical Harmonics</strong> (a way to represent a function over a surface of a sphere) have been around for several hundred
years in physics, but really were popularized in computer graphics around 2000 by Ravi Ramamoorthi and
Peter-Pike Sloan. But actually, a 1992 “Predicting Reflectance Functions from Complex Surfaces” paper by Westin, Arvo,
Torrance might be the first use of them in graphics.</p>
<p><strong>Point-Based Rendering</strong> in various forms has been around for a long time, e.g. particle systems were used since
“forever” (but typically used for vfx / non-solid phenomena).
“<a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~zwicker/projectpages/Surfels-SIG00.html">Surfels</a>” paper is from 2000. Something closer
to my heart, a whole bunch of demoscene demos are using non-traditional rendering approaches. Fairlight &amp; CNCD
have several notable examples, e.g.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VhecrFsZjc">Agenda Circling Forth</a> (2010),
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaPPHUt4K34">Ceasefire (all falls down..)</a> (2010),
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyXwmt0EZig">Number One / Another One</a> (2018):</p>

<p>
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-VhecrFsZjc" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</p>

<p>Real-time VFX tools like <a href="https://www.notch.one/">Notch</a> have pretty extensive features for creating, simulating
and displaying point/blob based “things”.</p>
<p>Ideas of representing images or scenes with a bunch of “primitive shapes”, as well as tools to generate those, have
been around too. E.g. <a href="https://github.com/fogleman/primitive">fogleman/primitive</a> (2016) is nice.</p>
<p>Media Molecule “Dreams” has a splat-based renderer (I think the shipped version is not purely splat-based
but a combination of several techniques). Check out the most excellent “Learning from Failure” talk by Alex Evans:
at <a href="https://advances.realtimerendering.com/s2015/#_TESSELLATION_IN_CALL">SIGGRAPH 2015</a> (splats start at slide 109)
or video from <a href="https://youtu.be/u9KNtnCZDMI?t=1354">Umbra Ignite 2015</a> (splats start at 22:34).</p>

<p>
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u9KNtnCZDMI" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</p>

<p><strong>Tiled Rasterization</strong> for particles has been around at least since 2014 (<a href="https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/GPUParticles11">“Holy smoke! Faster Particle Rendering
using Direct Compute”</a> by Gareth Thomas). And the idea
that dividing screen into tiles, doing a bunch of things “inside the tile” thus cutting on memory traffic,
is how <em>entire</em> mobile GPU space operates, and has been operating since “forever”, tracing back to first PowerVR
designs (1996) and even Pixel Planes 5 from 1989.</p>
<p>This is all <em>great</em>! Taking existing, developed, solid building blocks and combining them in a novel way is excellent
work.</p>
<h4 id="my-toy-playground">My Toy Playground</h4>
<p>My current implementation (of just the visualizer of Gaussian Splat models) for Unity is over at github:
<a href="https://github.com/aras-p/UnityGaussianSplatting"><strong>aras-p/UnityGaussianSplatting</strong></a>. Current state is “it kinda
works, but it is not fast”:</p>

<p>So all of that could be improved and optimized quite a bit!</p>
<p>One thing I haven’t seen talked much about, by everyone <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbXmGgJePsk">super excited</a>
about Gaussian Splats, is data size and memory usage. Yeah, rendering is nice, but this bicycle scene above is
1.5GB of data on-disk, and then at runtime it needs some more (for sorting, tile based rendering etc.).
That scene is six million blobs in space, with each of them taking about 250 bytes. There has to be some
way to make that smaller! Actually the Dreams talk above has some neat ideas.</p>
<p><em>Maybe I should play around with that. Someday!</em></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>In the annals of infrastructure investing,  Chicago is best known for getting fleeced in a notorious parking meter deal under ex-Mayor Richard M. Daley. We regret to report that short of declaring bankruptcy, the city is more stuck than ever with this ball-and-chain agreement for decades to come.</p><p>The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals earlier this month <a href="http://media.ca7.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/OpinionsWeb/processWebInputExternal.pl?Submit=Display&amp;Path=Y2023/D04-07/C:22-1166:J:Wood:aut:T:fnOp:N:3027710:S:0">affirmed</a> the deal with Chicago Parking Meters LLC, known as CPM, the private company that profits outrageously from Daley’s folly. The judges upheld the dismissal of a lawsuit brought by Chicago motorists who said the deal created a price-gouging monopoly that violates federal law aimed at preserving competitive markets.</p><p>The lawsuit claimed the deal left the city with no real control over on-street meters, and stymied efforts to expand public transit, create bike lanes or otherwise respond to changing times in any way that would interfere with the flow of meter money to CPM. Chicago, the suit alleged, had become a puppet of the investors, unable to act in the public interest without financial penalties that made action unaffordable and therefore impossible.</p><p>Alas, the appellate judges made mincemeat of that argument. While the deal “might have been foolish, short-sighted or worse,” the court said, perhaps employing some irony Chicago was within its rights to undertake the giveaway, and still retains enough regulatory authority to put a kibosh on the lawsuit’s monopoly claim.</p><p>So much for a creative legal effort to win back some leverage on behalf of the suckers otherwise known as Chicago’s citizens.</p><p>The deal came about in 2008, as Daley and the City Council — whose lapdog aldermen were the real puppets in this case — sought to close a budget shortfall. After due diligence so cursory as to not deserve the name, Chicago agreed to sell a 75-year lease on its parking meter system for just $1.16 billion. Within a few years, the city had spent that money, and sharply jacked up parking rates, as required in the deal. The investors, meantime, recouped their original outlay within a decade, and made millions in additional profits with much more still to come.</p><section aria-roledescription="carousel" aria-label="Tribune cartoonist’s decadeslong critique of Chicago’s parking meter deal" id="gallery_div_SBGRPPKBBBHRVAIZDWOV5RYN3M"><div id="gallery-images-SBGRPPKBBBHRVAIZDWOV5RYN3M" data-image-id="BMDKTNGVOBFTXLQH2N6QO7GPBI" role="group" aria-roledescription="slide" aria-label="1 of 6" aria-hidden="false" aria-live="polite"><picture><source srcset="https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/Z3g2j7RIg9rhQEVhCXqQIohPEso=/800x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/BMDKTNGVOBFTXLQH2N6QO7GPBI.jpg" media="screen and (min-width: 996px)"><source srcset="https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/vXKsPm3hnqeRexSSNLeyw52d4hE=/600x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/BMDKTNGVOBFTXLQH2N6QO7GPBI.jpg" media="screen and (min-width: 768px)"><source srcset="https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/4FayPcSsndL9sNyroFHEbU_FAfE=/400x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/BMDKTNGVOBFTXLQH2N6QO7GPBI.jpg" media="screen and (min-width: 0px)"><img src="https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/Z3g2j7RIg9rhQEVhCXqQIohPEso=/800x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/BMDKTNGVOBFTXLQH2N6QO7GPBI.jpg" data-lightbox="https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/_UhDmrInS4XRfhAoV6sKyKW6Dag=/1600x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/BMDKTNGVOBFTXLQH2N6QO7GPBI.jpg" width="800" height="0" loading="eager"></picture></div><p><span>After the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the deal with Chicago Parking Meters LLC, the city is more stuck than ever with this ball-and-chain parking meter deal. </span>(Scott Stantis/For the Chicago Tribune)</p></section><p>The investors were fiendishly clever in guaranteeing their interests. Under the contract, the city must maintain at least 30,000 meters in any given year, according to the 7th Circuit ruling. With a few trivial exceptions, if the city cuts parking fees, reduces the number of spaces or the hours of operation, or even just fails to keep up with inflation, it is obliged to pay CPM for “lost” revenue.</p><p>After those so-called true-up payments became a political scandal in 2013, ex-Mayor Rahm Emanuel amended and reapproved the contract, further binding the city to it. As it stands, Chicago has paid more than $150 million in true-ups to CPM, according to the court’s ruling, and there’s every reason to expect it will be paying more in the future.</p><p>This is where we thought the lawsuit made a very good point. While Chicago has the authority to set parking rates and revise the number and location of meters, those powers are toothless, as the lawsuit said, because the city can’t use them freely without paying a fortune to its CPM overlords.</p><p>The court didn’t see it that way. The city has shown it still regulates its parking by, for instance, adding meters in new zones that are treated differently from those covered under the deal. “The fact that the city pays a price for certain actions cannot be enough to undermine the whole concession,” the court found. “Regulation is possible even if the city must conduct a cost-benefit analysis before it takes a given step.”</p><p>Benefits? What benefits?</p><p>Well, the original check didn’t bounce. CPM paid the $1.16 billion upfront, temporarily saving Daley and his henchmen from making budget cuts or raising taxes while enabling them, in typical Illinois fashion, to kick financial obligations down the road.</p><p>CPM also agreed to some changes in 2013 that made the deal <a href="https://www.metroplanning.org/work/project/29/subpage/3?utm_source=%2fparking&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=redirect&amp;RedirectReferrer=https%3a%2f%2fwww.google.com%2f">slightly less terrible</a> for the city. Plus, it invested a substantial sum (though nowhere near its profits to date) in replacing old-fashioned coin meters with electronic ones, updating the system for mobile apps and handling payments. The system works efficiently, at least compared with those in other cities that haven’t updated their meters.</p><p>But the cost!</p><p>Way back in 2009, Chicago’s <a href="http://dig.abclocal.go.com/wls/documents/060209parkingmeter.pdf">inspector general</a> confirmed that the city had sold out for far less than the lease’s value. A report by Bloomberg Business said CPM stood to earn about <i>10 times</i> what it paid over the life of the contract. Any way you slice it financially, Chicago got taken to the cleaners.</p><div id="news_letter_div"><p><img src="https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/_j7aoDIYkhkbQAu2Gz60E2VD_qw=/84x84/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/PGWZQSUOSVFADASMRE3G2YHBKY.jpg" width="84" height="84"></p><div><p><h3>Chicago Tribune Opinion</h3></p><p>Weekdays</p><p>Read the latest editorials and commentary curated by the Tribune Opinion team.</p></div></div><p>Worse still, the deal makes it harder for Chicago to get greener and otherwise change with the times. It commits the city to devoting vast stretches of public real estate to metered parking at the expense of initiatives that de-emphasize motor vehicles.</p><p>Closing streets for outdoor dining, street fairs and festivals becomes more costly, as does making the city friendlier to pedestrians, cyclists, public transit and ride-sharing. The deal also complicated Chicago’s pandemic response, so, yes, it’s bad for public health too.</p><p>We wish we had better news, but at least there’s this: Can we all agree that Chicago must never, never, <i>never </i>let another parking meter deal happen?</p><p>The next time an arrogant mayor tries to ram through a megabucks contract lasting damn-near forever with no real analysis, remember the parking deal!</p><p>We have a message for the CPM investors too. You were far smarter than the city of Chicago and you made a fortune.
