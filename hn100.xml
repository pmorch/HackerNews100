<p>A new report in the Wall Street Journal highlights the stratospheric costs that Big Tech faces delivering AI capabilities to their customers. And it seems that even the paid services are losing money.</p>
<p>“Microsoft used AI from its partner OpenAI to launch GitHub Copilot, a service that helps programmers create, fix, and translate code,” <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/ais-costly-buildup-could-make-early-products-a-hard-sell-bdd29b9f">the publication notes</a>. “It has been popular with coders—more than 1.5 million people have used it and it is helping build nearly half of Copilot users’ code—because it slashes the time and effort needed to program. It has also been a money loser because it is so expensive to run.”</p><div data-thurrott-section="inline-form"><h2>Windows Intelligence In Your Inbox</h2><p>Sign up for our new free newsletter to get three time-saving tips each Friday — <i>and</i> get free copies of Paul Thurrott's Windows 11 and Windows 10 Field Guides (normally $9.99) as a special welcome gift!</p>

</div>
<p>As the WSJ notes, individuals pay $10 per month for GitHub Copilot, but multiple sources told it that the service loses an average of $20 per user per month, with some users costing Microsoft as much as $80 per month. So it’s likely that this situation played a role in the company’s decision to charge a lot more for the AI capabilities it will soon provide via Microsoft 365 Copilot. That service will cost customers $30 per user per month on top of the normal monthly Microsoft 365 subscription fee (which varies by tier). It’s not coincidental that <a href="https://www.thurrott.com/cloud/287822/google-duet-ai-to-cost-30-per-user-per-month-just-like-microsoft-365-copilot">Google will charge an identical additional per-user fee</a> for <a href="https://www.thurrott.com/cloud/282958/google-workspace-duet-ai">its similar Duet AI offering</a>.</p>
<p>The extravagant cost of AI also explains why <a href="https://www.thurrott.com/cloud/290645/microsoft-first-ai-chip-could-be-revealed-november-2023">Microsoft is working to develop its own in-house AI chipsets for use in its datacenters</a> and is pushing the PC industry to adopt what it calls NPUs—Neural Processing Units that accelerate AI operations independently of the CPU—that will usher in <a href="https://www.thurrott.com/hardware/290462/hp-ai-will-transform-the-pc-into-a-personal-companion">the new era of PC computing that HP discussed last week</a>: These coming PCs will be able to offload some AI tasks from the cloud and process them locally, reducing the expenses on the backend.</p>
<p>Microsoft is also looking at shorter-term solutions for the costs of AI, especially for services like Bing Chat, Bing Image Creator, and Microsoft Copilot which are free to users. One possible solution is to use less powerful backend services that don’t cost as much to run, according to some reports.</p>
<p>Interestingly, it appears that Adobe—which charges Creative Cloud customers astonishing sums each month for its suite of artistic tools—has solved this problem with its Firefly generative AI tools, which are profitable: It simply slows down the service’s performance on a per-user basis once that user has gone over their monthly credit allotment, an allotment that is no doubt based on the price they pay Adobe each month. “We are trying to protect ourselves on the cost side,” Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen told the WSJ.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main" id="maincontent"><article expanded="true"><div data-io-article-url="/2023/10/10/valve-confirms-counter-strike-2-no-macos/"><p>Valve on Monday said it has no plans for a macOS version of the recently released game <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>, the follow-up title replacing the hugely popular FPS <em>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/t/VgaymjyzNfrz_l_nGeI0-b1dAS0=/400x0/article-new/2023/09/counter-srike-21.jpg?lossy" srcset="https://images.macrumors.com/t/VgaymjyzNfrz_l_nGeI0-b1dAS0=/400x0/article-new/2023/09/counter-srike-21.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/3LYFtb0PCSAnjDkTeOstiTfiAj8=/800x0/article-new/2023/09/counter-srike-21.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/XPibE-qX4IBita2iI7uQ91Z1lDM=/1600x0/article-new/2023/09/counter-srike-21.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/GpOy1aPnNhtJDtKPUb7ywXHOKTo=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale()/article-new/2023/09/counter-srike-21.jpg 2500w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 697px" alt="counter srike 21" width="800" height="450"><br>Valve confirmed its decision and gave its reasons in a newly published <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/73EF-08A3-0935-6369">Steam support FAQ</a>:<br>
</p>
<blockquote><p>As technology advances, we have made the difficult decision to discontinue support for older hardware, including DirectX 9 and 32-bit operating systems. Similarly, we will no longer support macOS. Combined, these represented less than one percent of active CS:GO players.</p>
<p>Moving forward, Counter-Strike 2 will exclusively support 64-bit Windows and Linux.</p></blockquote>
<p>Last month's release of <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> forced a 26GB update for everyone with <em>CS:GO</em>, including Mac users, but after installation those on macOS soon discovered that the update <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/30/counter-strike-2-no-mac-version-available/">makes the original game as well as the update unplayable</a> because of the lack of support and no rollback option. </p>
<p>Valve now says Mac players will be eligible for a Prime Status Upgrade refund if most of their <em>CS:GO</em> playtime was on macOS and they played <em>CS:GO</em> on a Mac between the announcement of the <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> Limited Test (March 22, 2023) and the launch of <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> (September 27, 2023), regardless of when they purchased their Prime Status Upgrade. Valve will offer the refunds until December 1, 2023.</p>
<p>Valve added that those who wish to continue playing <em>CS:GO</em> on macOS will be able to access a legacy version or "frozen build" of the game, which has all the features of <em>CS:GO</em> except for official matchmaking. Support for this version of <em>CS:GO</em> will end on January 1, 2024. After this date, the game will still be available, but certain functionality that relies on compatibility with the Game Coordinator (e.g., access to inventory) may degrade and/or fail, according to Valve.</p>
<p>Despite Valve's refund offer to Mac users, the news that a macOS version of <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> is not in active development will come as a bitter blow to many players. Though <em>CS:GO</em> launched all the way back in 2012, it's still one of the most popular FPS games available today, with tens of millions of players logging in each month. So even if less than 1 percent of the user base is on Mac, that could still account for hundreds of thousands of players.</p>
<p>Regardless of numbers, one of the reasons Valve is reluctant to develop <em>CS2</em> for Mac is that Apple devices do not provide native support for the Vulkan API that the game is based on. Vulkan was designed to succeed OpenGL and address some of the latter's shortcomings, and while there is an open-source library called MoltenVK that provides a Vulkan implementation on top of Apple's Metal graphics API, it still lacks some of Vulkan's advanced features.</p>

Although these attacks are among the largest attacks Google has seen, our global load-balancing and DDoS mitigation infrastructure helped keep our services running.

As we understood more details about the attack methodology, we developed a set of mitigations and updated our proxies and denial-of-service defense systems to efficiently mitigate this technique. Since Google Cloud’s <a href="https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing?hl=en">Application Load Balancer</a> and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/armor/?hl=en">Cloud Armor</a> use the same hardware and software infrastructure that Google relies on to serve its own internet-facing services, the Cloud customers who use those services have their Internet-facing web apps and services similarly protected.</p><h3>Industry coordination and response for CVE-2023-44487</h3><p>Soon after detecting the earliest of these attacks in August, Google applied additional mitigation strategies and coordinated a cross-industry response with other cloud providers and software maintainers who implement the HTTP/2 protocol stack. We shared intelligence about the attack and mitigation methodologies in real time as the attacks were underway.</p><p>This cross-industry collaboration has resulted in patches and other mitigation techniques used by many large infrastructure providers. The collaboration helped to pave the way for today’s coordinated responsible disclosure of the new attack methodology and potential susceptibility across a multitude of common open source and commercial proxies, application servers, and load balancers.</p><p>The collective susceptibility to this attack is being tracked as <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-44487" target="_blank">CVE-2023-44487</a> and has been designated a High severity vulnerability with a <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss" target="_blank">CVSS</a> score of 7.5 (out of 10).</p><p>Google expresses sincere gratitude to all of the cross-industry stakeholders who have collaborated, shared information, accelerated patching of their infrastructure, and rapidly made patches available to their customers.</p><h3>Who is susceptible and what to do about it</h3><p>Any enterprise or individual that is serving an HTTP-based workload to the Internet may be at risk from this attack. Web applications, services, and APIs on a server or proxy able to communicate using the HTTP/2 protocol could be vulnerable. Organizations should verify that any servers they run that support HTTP/2 are not vulnerable, or apply vendor patches for CVE-2023-44487 to limit impact from this attack vector. If you are managing or operating your own HTTP/2-capable server (open source or commercial) you should immediately apply a patch from the relevant vendor when available.</p><h3>Next steps</h3><p>Defending against massive DDoS attacks such as those described here is difficult. With or without patches, organizations would need to make significant infrastructure investments to keep services running in the face of attacks of any moderate size and larger.

This attack exploits a weakness in the HTTP/2 protocol to generate enormous, hyper-volumetric Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Cloudflare has mitigated a barrage of these attacks in recent months, including an attack three times larger than <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-mitigates-record-breaking-71-million-request-per-second-ddos-attack/">any previous attack we’ve observed</a>, which exceeded 201 million requests per second (rps). Since the end of August 2023, Cloudflare has mitigated more than 1,100 other attacks with over 10 million rps — and 184 attacks that were greater than our previous DDoS record of 71 million rps. </p><p>This zero-day provided threat actors with a critical new tool in their Swiss Army knife of vulnerabilities to exploit and attack their victims at a magnitude that has never been seen before. While at times complex and challenging to combat, these attacks allowed Cloudflare the opportunity to develop purpose-built technology to mitigate the effects of the zero-day vulnerability.</p><p>If you are using Cloudflare for HTTP DDoS mitigation, you are protected. And below, we’ve included more information on this vulnerability, and resources and recommendations on what you can do to secure yourselves.</p><h3 id="deconstructing-the-attack-what-every-cso-needs-to-know">Deconstructing the attack: What every CSO needs to know</h3><p>In late August 2023, our team at Cloudflare noticed a new zero-day vulnerability, developed by an unknown threat actor, that exploits the standard HTTP/2 protocol — a fundamental protocol that is critical to how the Internet and all websites work. This novel zero-day vulnerability attack, dubbed Rapid Reset, leverages HTTP/2’s stream cancellation feature by sending a request and immediately canceling it over and over. &nbsp;</p><p>By automating this trivial “request, cancel, request, cancel” pattern at scale, threat actors are able to create a denial of service and take down any server or application running the standard implementation of HTTP/2. Furthermore, one crucial thing to note about the record-breaking attack is that it involved a modestly-sized botnet, consisting of roughly 20,000 machines. Cloudflare regularly detects botnets that are orders of magnitude larger than this — comprising hundreds of thousands and even millions of machines. For a relatively small botnet to output such a large volume of requests, with the potential to incapacitate nearly any server or application supporting HTTP/2, underscores how menacing this vulnerability is for unprotected networks.</p><p>Threat actors used botnets in tandem with the HTTP/2 vulnerability to amplify requests at rates we have never seen before. As a result, our team at Cloudflare experienced some intermittent edge instability. While our systems were able to mitigate the overwhelming majority of incoming attacks, the volume overloaded some components in our network, impacting a small number of customers’ performance with intermittent 4xx and 5xx errors — all of which were quickly resolved. </p><p>Once we successfully mitigated these issues and halted potential attacks for all customers, our team immediately kicked off a responsible disclosure process. We entered into conversations with industry peers to see how we could work together to help move our mission forward and safeguard the large percentage of the Internet that relies on our network prior to releasing this vulnerability to the general public. </p><p>We cover the technical details of the attack in more detail in a separate blog post: <a href="https://cfl.re/rapid-reset-breakdown">HTTP/2 Rapid Reset: deconstructing the record-breaking attack</a>.</p><h3 id="how-is-cloudflare-and-the-industry-thwarting-this-attack">How is Cloudflare and the industry thwarting this attack?</h3><p>There is no such thing as a “perfect disclosure.” Thwarting attacks and responding to emerging incidents requires organizations and security teams to live by an assume-breach mindset — because there will always be another zero-day, new evolving threat actor groups, and never-before-seen novel attacks and techniques. </p><p>This “assume-breach” mindset is a key foundation towards information sharing and ensuring in instances such as this that the Internet remains safe. While Cloudflare was experiencing and mitigating these attacks, we were also working with industry partners to guarantee that the industry at-large could withstand this attack. &nbsp;</p><p>During the process of mitigating this attack, our Cloudflare team developed and purpose-built new technology to stop these DDoS attacks and further improve our own mitigations for this and other future attacks of massive scale. These efforts have significantly increased our overall mitigation capabilities and resiliency. If you are using Cloudflare, we are confident that you are protected. </p><p>Our team also alerted web server software partners who are developing patches to ensure this vulnerability cannot be exploited — check their websites for more information.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/10/Zero-Day-protection-4.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="416"></figure><p>Disclosures are never one and done. The lifeblood of Cloudflare is to ensure a better Internet, which stems from instances such as these. When we have the opportunity to work with our industry partners and governments to ensure there are no widespread impacts on the Internet, we are doing our part in increasing the cyber resiliency of every organization no matter the size or vertical.</p><p>To gain more of an understanding around mitigation tactics and next steps on patching, <a href="https://event.on24.com/wcc/r/4378646/EC4EB4A6CE2B363BC6378891E495BEBF">register for our webinar</a>.</p><h3 id="what-are-the-origins-of-the-http2-rapid-reset-and-these-record-breaking-attacks-on-cloudflare">What are the origins of the HTTP/2 Rapid Reset and these record-breaking attacks on Cloudflare?</h3><p>It may seem odd that Cloudflare was one of the first companies to witness these attacks. Why would threat actors attack a company that has some of the most robust defenses against DDoS attacks in the world? &nbsp;</p><p>The reality is that Cloudflare often sees attacks before they are turned on more vulnerable targets. Threat actors need to develop and test their tools before they deploy them in the wild. Threat actors who possess record-shattering attack methods can have an extremely difficult time testing and understanding how large and effective they are, because they don't have the infrastructure to absorb the attacks they are launching. Because of the transparency that we share on our network performance, and the measurements of attacks they could glean from our public performance charts, this threat actor was likely targeting us to understand the capabilities of the exploit.</p><p>But that testing, and the ability to see the attack early, helps us develop mitigations for the attack that benefit both our customers and industry as a whole.</p><h3 id="from-cso-to-cso-what-should-you-do">From CSO to CSO: What should you do?</h3><p>I have been a CSO for over 20 years, on the receiving end of countless disclosures and &nbsp;announcements like this. But whether it was <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/exploitation-of-cve-2021-44228-before-public-disclosure-and-evolution-of-waf-evasion-patterns/">Log4J</a>, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/solarwinds-orion-compromise-trend-data/">Solarwinds</a>, <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/ransomware/how-to-prevent-ransomware/">EternalBlue</a> <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/ransomware/petya-notpetya-ransomware/">WannaCry/NotPetya</a>, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/heartbleed-revisited/">Heartbleed</a>, or <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/inside-shellshock/">Shellshock</a>, all of these security incidents have a commonality. A tremendous explosion that ripples across the world and creates an opportunity to completely disrupt any of the organizations that I have led — regardless of the industry or the size. </p><p>Many of these were attacks or vulnerabilities that we may have not been able to control. But regardless of whether the issue arose from something that was in my control or not, what has set any successful initiative I have led apart from those that did not lean in our favor was the ability to respond when zero-day vulnerabilities and exploits like this are identified. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>While I wish I could say that Rapid Reset may be different this time around, it is not. I am calling all CSOs — no matter if you’ve lived through the decades of security incidents that I have, or this is your first day on the job — this is the time to ensure you are protected and stand up your cyber incident response team. </p><p>We’ve kept the information restricted until today to give as many security vendors as possible the opportunity to react. However, at some point, the responsible thing becomes to publicly disclose zero-day threats like this. Today is that day. That means that after today, threat actors will be largely aware of the HTTP/2 vulnerability; and it will inevitably become trivial to exploit and kickoff the race between defenders and attacks — first to patch vs. first to exploit. Organizations should assume that systems will be tested, and take proactive measures to ensure protection.</p><p>To me, this is reminiscent of a vulnerability like Log4J, due to the many variants that are emerging daily, and will continue to come to fruition in the weeks, months, and years to come. As more researchers and threat actors experiment with the vulnerability, we may find different variants with even shorter exploit cycles that contain even more advanced bypasses. &nbsp;</p><p>And just like Log4J, managing incidents like this isn’t as simple as “run the patch, now you’re done”. You need to turn incident management, patching, and evolving your security protections into ongoing processes — because the patches for each variant of a vulnerability reduce your risk, but they don’t eliminate it.</p><p>I don’t mean to be alarmist, but I will be direct: you must take this seriously. Treat this as a full active incident to ensure nothing happens to your organization.</p><h3 id="recommendations-for-a-new-standard-of-change">Recommendations for a New Standard of Change</h3><p>While no one security event is ever identical to the next, there are lessons that can be learned. CSOs, here are my recommendations that must be implemented immediately. Not only in this instance, but for years to come:</p><ul><li>Understand your external and partner network’s external connectivity to remediate any Internet facing systems with the mitigations below.</li><li>Understand your existing security protection and capabilities you have to protect, detect and respond to an attack and immediately remediate any issues you have in your network.</li><li>Ensure your DDoS Protection resides outside of your data center because if the traffic gets to your datacenter, it will be difficult to mitigate the DDoS attack.</li><li>Ensure you have DDoS protection for Applications (Layer 7) and ensure you have Web Application Firewalls. Additionally as a best practice, ensure you have complete DDoS protection for DNS, Network Traffic (Layer 3) and API Firewalls</li><li>Ensure web server and operating system patches are deployed across all Internet Facing Web Servers. Also, ensure all automation like Terraform builds and images are fully patched so older versions of web servers are not deployed into production over the secure images by accident.</li><li>As a last resort, consider turning off HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 (likely also vulnerable) to mitigate the threat. &nbsp;This is a last resort only, because there will be a significant performance issues if you downgrade to HTTP/1.1</li><li>Consider a secondary, cloud-based DDoS L7 provider at perimeter for resilience.</li></ul><p>Cloudflare’s mission is to help build a better Internet. If you are concerned with your current state of DDoS protection, we are more than happy to provide you with our DDoS capabilities and resilience for free to mitigate any attempts of a successful DDoS attack. &nbsp;We know the stress that you are facing as we have fought off these attacks for the last 30 days and made our already best in class systems, even better. </p><p>If you’re interested in finding out more, we have a webinar coming up with more details on the zero-day and how to respond; you can <a href="https://event.on24.com/wcc/r/4378646/EC4EB4A6CE2B363BC6378891E495BEBF">register here</a>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div jsname="tx2NYc"><section><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p>A number of Google services and Cloud customers have been targeted with a novel HTTP/2-based DDoS attack which peaked in August. These attacks were significantly larger than any <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/how-google-cloud-blocked-largest-layer-7-ddos-attack-at-46-million-rps">previously-reported Layer 7 attacks</a>, with the largest attack <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/google-cloud-mitigated-largest-ddos-attack-peaking-above-398-million-rps">surpassing 398 million requests per second</a>.</p><p>The attacks were largely stopped at the edge of our network by Google's global load balancing infrastructure and did not lead to any outages. While the impact was minimal, Google's DDoS Response Team reviewed the attacks and added additional protections to further mitigate similar attacks. In addition to Google's internal response, we helped lead a coordinated disclosure process with industry partners to address the new HTTP/2 vector across the ecosystem.</p></span></section><section><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p>Below, we explain the predominant methodology for Layer 7 attacks over the last few years, what changed in these new attacks to make them so much larger, and the mitigation strategies we believe are effective against this attack type. This article is written from the perspective of a reverse proxy architecture, where the HTTP request is terminated by a reverse proxy that forwards requests to other services. The same concepts apply to HTTP servers that are integrated into the application server, but with slightly different considerations which potentially lead to different mitigation strategies.</p><h3>A primer on HTTP/2 for DDoS</h3><p>Since late 2021, the majority of Layer 7 DDoS attacks we've observed across Google first-party services and Google Cloud projects protected by <a href="https://cloud.google.com/armor">Cloud Armor</a> have been based on HTTP/2, both by number of attacks and by peak request rates.</p><p>A primary design goal of HTTP/2 was efficiency, and unfortunately the features that make HTTP/2 more efficient for legitimate clients can also be used to make DDoS attacks more efficient.</p><h3>Stream multiplexing</h3><p>HTTP/2 uses "streams", bidirectional abstractions used to transmit various messages, or "frames", between the endpoints. “Stream multiplexing” is the core HTTP/2 feature which allows higher utilization of each TCP connection. Streams are multiplexed in a way that can be tracked by both sides of the connection while only using one Layer 4 connection. Stream multiplexing enables clients to have multiple in-flight requests without managing multiple individual connections.</p><p>One of the main constraints when mounting a Layer 7 DoS attack is the number of concurrent transport connections. Each connection carries a cost, including operating system memory for socket records and buffers, CPU time for the TLS handshake, as well as each connection needing a unique four-tuple, the IP address and port pair for each side of the connection, constraining the number of concurrent connections between two IP addresses.</p><p>In HTTP/1.1, each request is processed serially. The server will read a request, process it, write a response, and only then read and process the next request. In practice, this means that the rate of requests that can be sent over a single connection is one request per round trip, where a round trip includes the network latency, proxy processing time and backend request processing time. While HTTP/1.1 pipelining is available in some clients and servers to increase a connection's throughput, it is not prevalent amongst legitimate clients.</p><p>With HTTP/2, the client can open multiple concurrent streams on a single TCP connection, each stream corresponding to one HTTP request. The maximum number of concurrent open streams is, in theory, controllable by the server, but in practice clients may open 100 streams per request and the servers process these requests in parallel. It’s important to note that server limits can not be unilaterally adjusted.</p><p>For example, the client can open 100 streams and send a request on each of them in a single round trip; the proxy will read and process each stream serially, but the requests to the backend servers can again be parallelized. The client can then open new streams as it receives responses to the previous ones. This gives an effective throughput for a single connection of 100 requests per round trip, with similar round trip timing constants to HTTP/1.1 requests. This will typically lead to almost 100 times higher utilization of each connection.</p><h3>The HTTP/2 Rapid Reset attack</h3><p>The HTTP/2 protocol allows clients to indicate to the server that a previous stream should be canceled by sending a RST_STREAM frame. The protocol does not require the client and server to coordinate the cancellation in any way, the client may do it unilaterally. The client may also assume that the cancellation will take effect immediately when the server receives the RST_STREAM frame, before any other data from that TCP connection is processed.</p><p>This attack is called Rapid Reset because it relies on the ability for an endpoint to send a RST_STREAM frame immediately after sending a request frame, which makes the other endpoint start working and then rapidly resets the request. The request is canceled, but leaves the HTTP/2 connection open.</p></span></section><section><figure><section jscontroller="SCGBie" jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/2023_worlds_largest_rapid_reset_diagram.max-1616x909.png" alt="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/2023_worlds_largest_rapid_reset_diagram.max-1616x909.png" jsname="P3Vluc" jsaction="click:HTIlC" loading="lazy"></section></figure><p><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p>HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 request and response pattern</p></span></p></section><section><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p>The HTTP/2 Rapid Reset attack built on this capability is simple: The client opens a large number of streams at once as in the standard HTTP/2 attack, but rather than waiting for a response to each request stream from the server or proxy, the client cancels each request immediately.</p><p>The ability to reset streams immediately allows each connection to have an indefinite number of requests in flight. By explicitly canceling the requests, the attacker never exceeds the limit on the number of concurrent open streams. The number of in-flight requests is no longer dependent on the round-trip time (RTT), but only on the available network bandwidth.</p><p>In a typical HTTP/2 server implementation, the server will still have to do significant amounts of work for canceled requests, such as allocating new stream data structures, parsing the query and doing header decompression, and mapping the URL to a resource. For reverse proxy implementations, the request may be proxied to the backend server before the RST_STREAM frame is processed. The client on the other hand paid almost no costs for sending the requests. This creates an exploitable cost asymmetry between the server and the client.</p><p>Another advantage the attacker gains is that the explicit cancellation of requests immediately after creation means that a reverse proxy server won't send a response to any of the requests. Canceling the requests before a response is written reduces downlink (server/proxy to attacker) bandwidth.</p><h3>HTTP/2 Rapid Reset attack variants</h3><p>In the weeks after the initial DDoS attacks, we have seen some Rapid Reset attack variants. These variants are generally not as efficient as the initial version was, but might still be more efficient than standard HTTP/2 DDoS attacks.</p><p>The first variant does not immediately cancel the streams, but instead opens a batch of streams at once, waits for some time, and then cancels those streams and then immediately opens another large batch of new streams. This attack may bypass mitigations that are based on just the rate of inbound RST_STREAM frames (such as allow at most 100 RST_STREAMs per second on a connection before closing it).</p><p>These attacks lose the main advantage of the canceling attacks by not maximizing connection utilization, but still have some implementation efficiencies over standard HTTP/2 DDoS attacks. But this variant does mean that any mitigation based on rate-limiting stream cancellations should set fairly strict limits to be effective.</p><p>The second variant does away with canceling streams entirely, and instead optimistically tries to open more concurrent streams than the server advertised. The benefit of this approach over the standard HTTP/2 DDoS attack is that the client can keep the request pipeline full at all times, and eliminate client-proxy RTT as a bottleneck. It can also eliminate the proxy-server RTT as a bottleneck if the request is to a resource that the HTTP/2 server responds to immediately.</p><p><a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9113.html" target="_blank">RFC 9113</a>, the current HTTP/2 RFC, suggests that an attempt to open too many streams should invalidate only the streams that exceeded the limit, not the entire connection. We believe that most HTTP/2 servers will not process those streams, and is what enables the non-cancelling attack variant by almost immediately accepting and processing a new stream after responding to a previous stream.</p><h3>A multifaceted approach to mitigations</h3><p>We don't expect that simply blocking individual requests is a viable mitigation against this class of attacks — instead the entire TCP connection needs to be closed when abuse is detected. HTTP/2 provides built-in support for closing connections, using the GOAWAY frame type. The RFC defines a process for gracefully closing a connection that involves first sending an informational GOAWAY that does not set a limit on opening new streams, and one round trip later sending another that forbids opening additional streams.</p><p>However, this graceful GOAWAY process is usually not implemented in a way which is robust against malicious clients. This form of mitigation leaves the connection vulnerable to Rapid Reset attacks for too long, and should not be used for building mitigations as it does not stop the inbound requests. Instead, the GOAWAY should be set up to limit stream creation immediately.</p><p>This leaves the question of deciding which connections are abusive. The client canceling requests is not inherently abusive, the feature exists in the HTTP/2 protocol to help better manage request processing. Typical situations are when a browser no longer needs a resource it had requested due to the user navigating away from the page, or applications using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_technology#Long_polling" target="_blank">long polling</a> approach with a client-side timeout.</p><p>Mitigations for this attack vector can take multiple forms, but mostly center around tracking connection statistics and using various signals and business logic to determine how useful each connection is. For example, if a connection has more than 100 requests with more than 50% of the given requests canceled, it could be a candidate for a mitigation response. The magnitude and type of response depends on the risk to each platform, but responses can range from forceful GOAWAY frames as discussed before to closing the TCP connection immediately.</p><p>To mitigate against the non-cancelling variant of this attack, we recommend that HTTP/2 servers should close connections that exceed the concurrent stream limit. This can be either immediately or after some small number of repeat offenses.</p><h3>Applicability to other protocols</h3><p>We do not believe these attack methods translate directly to HTTP/3 (QUIC) due to protocol differences, and Google does not currently see HTTP/3 used as a DDoS attack vector at scale. Despite that, our recommendation is for HTTP/3 server implementations to proactively implement mechanisms to limit the amount of work done by a single transport connection, similar to the HTTP/2 mitigations discussed above.</p><h3>Industry coordination</h3><p>Early in our DDoS Response Team's investigation and in coordination with industry partners, it was apparent that this new attack type could have a broad impact on any entity offering the HTTP/2 protocol for their services. Google helped lead a coordinated vulnerability disclosure process taking advantage of a pre-existing coordinated vulnerability disclosure group, which has been used for a number of other efforts in the past.</p><p>During the disclosure process, the team focused on notifying large-scale implementers of HTTP/2 including infrastructure companies and server software providers. The goal of these prior notifications was to develop and prepare mitigations for a coordinated release. In the past, this approach has enabled widespread protections to be enabled for service providers or available via software updates for many packages and solutions.</p><p>During the coordinated disclosure process, we reserved <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-44487" target="_blank">CVE-2023-44487</a> to track fixes to the various HTTP/2 implementations.</p><h3>Next steps</h3><p>The novel attacks discussed in this post can have significant impact on services of any scale. All providers who have HTTP/2 services should assess their exposure to this issue. Software patches and updates for common web servers and programming languages may be available to apply now or in the near future. We recommend applying those fixes as soon as possible.</p><p>For our customers, we recommend patching software and enabling the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing?hl=en">Application Load Balancer</a> and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/armor">Google Cloud Armor</a>, which has been protecting Google and existing Google Cloud Application Load Balancing users.</p></span></section><section><span>Posted in</span><ul><li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security" track-metadata-position="body" track-metadata-eventdetail="cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security" track-metadata-module="tag list" track-metadata-module_headline="posted in">Security &amp; Identity</a></li><li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/networking" track-metadata-position="body" track-metadata-eventdetail="cloud.google.com/blog/products/networking" track-metadata-module="tag list" track-metadata-module_headline="posted in">Networking</a></li><li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp" track-metadata-position="body" track-metadata-eventdetail="cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp" track-metadata-module="tag list" track-metadata-module_headline="posted in">Google Cloud</a></li></ul></section></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Close to 100 hospitals across the world have already benefitted from the use of the LEGO MRI Scanner thanks to Erik and his heartfelt dedication. The project has been extremely well received and in order to create even bigger impact and better grasp of its potential, the LEGO Foundation is now scaling the project and encouraging hospitals from all over the world to apply for one of the 600 models currently available. Built by LEGO volunteers, the models will be shipped completely free of charge to hospitals. Once distributed, the LEGO Foundation will generate insights from participating hospitals to continue building evidence-based research and in turn guide potential future projects.</p>
<p>To best support the use of LEGO MRI Scanners, the LEGO Foundation has developed <a href="https://learningthroughplay.com/lego-mri-scanner-models">four training videos</a> to accompany the model. These videos are designed to help medical staff guide children through the process of an MRI scan – and in turn, facilitate their social and emotional learning through play. The videos are available free of charge to any hospital wanting to learn more about the approach.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htUtn5em_Pw">video</a> gives an introduction to the LEGO MRI model and accompanying training material.<br>
Dorthe Feveile Kjerkegaard, Play &amp; Health Specialist at the LEGO Foundation added: “MRI scans can be scary, anxiety-inducing experiences for all of us, but especially so for children. Through a playful learning approach, such as the LEGO MRI Scanner, we’ve been able to take children through the process step by step to prepare them for what’s to come, and in turn, help them to feel safe by making the unknown, known. The feedback so far has been overwhelming. We’re honoured to be able to help both children and their parents have a more positive and less stressful experience, and look forward to supporting even more families around the world with the expansion of this concept.”</p>
<p>The LEGO Foundation will donate 600 models to the first 600 eligible applicants. Applicants must be based in a radiology department at a hospital, with an existing MRI scanning facility for use with children and adolescents. To access the request form visit: <a href="https://learningthroughplay.com/lego-mri-scanner-models">https://learningthroughplay.com/lego-mri-scanner-models</a>.</p>
<p>The model comes with close to 500 elements and measures 13cm wide, 25,5cm long and 10,5cm high.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
    <p>Hello everyone! It has been nearly three years since I last wrote to this blog. Fortunately, that does not mean Wayfire’s development has stopped! Quite the opposite, in fact I am happy to announce the release of Wayfire 0.8.0. There have been many changes and plugin API breakages since the Wayfire 0.7.x series, so I will try to summarize the important changes in the following paragraphs.</p>

<h3 id="user-facing-changes">User-facing changes</h3>

<p>First, let us take a look at the user-facing changes and new features that were added in this release:</p>

<h4 id="workspace-sets-wayfire-pr-1797">Workspace sets (Wayfire <a href="https://github.com/WayfireWM/wayfire/pull/1797">PR #1797</a>)</h4>

<p>Workspace sets are a new feature provided by the <code>wsets</code> plugin. A workspace set is the grid of workspaces on one output. Up until now, Wayfire always had one workspace set (albeit it wasn’t called like this) per output. With the recent changes, it is possible to have multiple workspace sets on each output and switch between them. The end result is very similar to how Sway’s workspaces work: the plugin numbers them from 1 to N, and at any given moment you can display any of the workspace sets on any of your outputs (however, each workspace set can be visible on at most one output at a time). Check the YouTube video to get a better sense of what they provide (the recording contains two Wayfire outputs side-by-side):</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QhGqlLK8Elo?si=Kf7Z8Uv5SR7N4ujr" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>The purpose of workspace sets is to have a dedicated set of normal workspaces for different activities the user does on their computer. For example, I have one workspace set (containing a 2x2 workspace grid) dedicated to Wayfire, where I have Wayfire’s source code, GitHub issues, wlroots, etc. There is another workspace set dedicated to a project I am working on for university, and so on. Of course, a similar effect could be achieved with a single bigger workspace grid, but having a 5x5 workspace grid quickly becomes difficult to navigate.</p>

<p>It should also be noted that workspace sets can be moved between outputs, which is something generally impossible with normal workspaces. I use this for example when switching between working on my laptop and an external monitor - it is just a matter of showing the workspace set on the new monitor.</p>

<h4 id="ipc-socket-wayfire-pr-1472-pr-1821">IPC socket (Wayfire <a href="https://github.com/WayfireWM/wayfire/pull/1472">PR #1472</a>, <a href="https://github.com/WayfireWM/wayfire/pull/1821">PR #1821</a>)</h4>

<p>A frequent request for Wayfire was the ability to control it via IPC commands. With this release, Wayfire now provides a socket that clients can use for this purpose. To use it, make sure to enable the <code>ipc</code> plugin (it should be first in the list of plugins). The <code>ipc</code> plugin itself does not implement any IPC commands, instead, it only provides a generic framework for other plugins to extend. The <code>ipc-rules</code> plugin provides a few basic window-management commands and can be used to substitute the <code>window-rules</code> plugin with a custom user-provided script, see <a href="https://github.com/WayfireWM/wayfire/blob/master/ipc-scripts/ipc-rules-demo.py">the Python example</a> for more information.</p>

<p>The plan for the future is to extend the <code>ipc-rules</code> plugin to support more commands and to report more events to the IPC clients. In addition, some other plugins provide their functionality as IPC commands, for example <code>wm-actions</code> and <code>grid</code>. Lastly, there is a new framework to allow all plugin bindings to be callable from an IPC script - for example after <a href="https://github.com/WayfireWM/wayfire/pull/1864/commits/48c30481afe47c8235885d2a2c7378091e6293f2">this commit</a>, the <code>scale</code> plugin can be activated from the IPC socket.</p>

<p>If you want to use the IPC socket, but the currently provided commands are not enough for your use-case (which is likely!), feel free to reach out to discuss how to extend the existing IPC support.</p>

<h4 id="smaller-changes">Smaller changes</h4>

<p>Some smaller, but important items from the git log:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Expo workspaces can now be navigated with the keyboard: <a href="https://github.com/WayfireWM/wayfire/pull/1156">PR #1156</a></li>
  <li>Animations for the simple-tile plugin: <a href="https://github.com/WayfireWM/wayfire/pull/1071">PR #1071</a></li>
  <li>Vswitch plugin has bindings for moving to a particular workspace and to last workspace: <a href="https://github.com/WayfireWM/wayfire/pull/1199">PR #1199</a>, <a href="https://github.com/WayfireWM/wayfire/pull/1371">PR #1371</a></li>
  <li>Multiple protocols which <strong>were previously provided by core have been moved to plugins</strong>: <code>wayfire-shell</code> (<a href="https://github.com/WayfireWM/wayfire/pull/1715">PR #1715</a>), <code>foreign-toplevel</code>, <code>gtk-shell</code> (<a href="https://github.com/WayfireWM/wayfire/pull/1678">PR #1678</a>). Most likely, you will want to enable those in your <code>wayfire.ini</code>.</li>
  <li>Added support for the xdg-activation-v1 protocol: <a href="https://github.com/WayfireWM/wayfire/pull/1898">PR #1898</a></li>
</ul>

<p>There were of course many, many other small fixes and added options and PRs, which cannot be all presented here. See the full git changelog for details :)</p>

<h4 id="wf-shell">wf-shell</h4>

<p>Thanks to multiple contributors, there have also been numerous improvements to the default panel, <code>wf-panel</code>, part of wf-shell:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Huge thanks to a new contributor @NamorNiradnug, who implemented:
    <ul>
      <li>A notifications widget: <a href="https://github.com/WayfireWM/wf-shell/pull/132">PR #132</a></li>
      <li>Command output widget for displaying the output of a shell command: <a href="https://github.com/WayfireWM/wf-shell/pull/148">PR #148</a></li>
      <li>A tray widget: <a href="https://github.com/WayfireWM/wf-shell/pull/153">PR #153</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Thanks to @soreau for implementing a logout interface: <a href="https://github.com/WayfireWM/wf-shell/pull/100">PR #100</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="plugin-api-changes">Plugin API changes</h3>

<p>The focus of the 0.8.0 release was to clear the technical debt which has accumulated in core over the time. As a result, many APIs were refactored and some were completely rewritten, resulting in many breaking changes for plugins. On the upside, with most of the glaring problems in the API fixed, plugin authors can expect less (at the very least, much less severe) API changes in the future.</p>

<p>The following is a summary of the big items, many of which also provide new or improved capabilities for plugins (and, unfortunately, expose more of the complexity at times).</p>

<h4 id="scenegraph-wayfire-pr-1501">Scenegraph (Wayfire <a href="https://github.com/WayfireWM/wayfire/pull/1501">PR #1501</a>)</h4>

<p>Until now, Wayfire has had very simple algorithm for rendering and input handling. Core had a list of outputs, and each output had a list of layers and views in them. While the basic structure has remained roughly the same, Wayfire 0.8.0 has a single structure called the scenegraph, which organizes all of these in a structure with a single interface. The scenegraph can also be used to repalce custom renderers and input grabs used in previous versions of Wayfire. See the <a href="https://github.com/WayfireWM/wayfire/wiki/Scenegraph">wiki page</a> on this topic for an introduction into the technical aspects of it.</p>

<h4 id="view-interface-wayfire-pr-1370-pr-1704">View Interface (Wayfire <a href="https://github.com/WayfireWM/wayfire/pull/1370">PR #1370</a>, <a href="https://github.com/WayfireWM/wayfire/pull/1704">PR #1704</a>)</h4>

<p>Over time, Wayfire’s central type - views, which represent application windows - has accumulated too many methods, fields and responsibilities. As a part of the refactoring effort, the input and rendering aspects of this interface have been moved to the scenegraph nodes associated with a given view. The view interface itself has been split in two - ‘generic’ views, which represent any type of window, including backgrounds, panels, etc. and a specialized subclass toplevel views, which represent toplevel windows, which can be moved, resized, maximized, etc. See the <a href="https://github.com/WayfireWM/wayfire/wiki/Views,-Toplevels-and-Transactions#views">wiki</a> for more details.</p>

<h4 id="transactions-wayfire-pr-1704">Transactions (Wayfire <a href="https://github.com/WayfireWM/wayfire/pull/1704">PR #1704</a>)</h4>

<p>Tiling plugins like <code>simple-tile</code> need a way to resize multiple toplevels synchronously. In addition, certain changes in toplevel states (for example fullscreening and resizing to the full output size) belong logically together. In the Wayland protocol, these concepts usually are represented by using commits which group together related changes to an object. In Wayfire 0.8, we also have a similar system on the server side - transactions. They can be used to update multiple toplevels (or in general, transaction objects) and their properties atomically.</p>

<p>Another possible application of transactions is providing out-of-compositor decorations, like Emerald for Compiz: with transactions, a plugin can synchronize the state of the decoration and the main window. However, support for this has only barely reached the proof-of-concept stage. For the interested in continuing this development, a starting point can be found <a href="https://github.com/ammen99/wf-basic-deco">here</a>.</p>

<h4 id="smaller-changes-1">Smaller changes</h4>

<p>There were also multiple smaller fixes and updates to the API, a non-exhaustive list of which is here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Plugins now have one single instance, instead of one instance per output (use <code>wf::per_output_plugin_t&lt;&gt;</code> as a helper for achieving the old behavior): <a href="https://github.com/WayfireWM/wayfire/pull/1674">PR #1674</a></li>
  <li>Keyboard focus is now tracked globally, instead of per-output: <a href="https://github.com/WayfireWM/wayfire/pull/1913">PR #1913</a></li>
  <li>The signals API has been rewritten, so that it operates on types instead of strings for the signal names, reducing their overhead: <a href="https://github.com/WayfireWM/wayfire/pull/1495">PR #1495</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Thank you for reading the blog to the end :) The latest Wayfire 0.8.0 release contains many breaking changes, but also some exciting new features. Do not hesitate to open bug reports if you notice any regressions if you are upgrading from the 0.7.x series. Last but not least, many thanks to everyone who has contributed code or has tested the git version of Wayfire!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<blockquote>
  <p>Why does C use the asterisk for pointers?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Simply - because <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_(programming_language)" rel="noreferrer">B</a> did.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because memory is a linear array, it is possible to interpret the value in a cell as an index in this array, and BCPL supplies an operator for this purpose. In the original language it was spelled <code>rv</code>, and later <code>!</code>, while B uses the unary <code>*</code>. Thus, if <code>p</code> is a cell containing the index of (or address of), or pointer to) another cell, <code>*p</code> refers to the contents of the pointed-to cell, either as a value in an expression or as the target of an assignment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><sup>From <a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/chist.pdf" rel="noreferrer">The Development of the C Language</a> </sup></p>

<p>Thats it.  At this point, the question is as uninteresting as "why does python 3 use <code>.</code> to call a method? Why not <code>-&gt;</code>?"  Well... because Python 2 uses <code>.</code> to call a method.</p>

<p>Rarely does a language exist from nothing.  It has influences and is based on something that came before.</p>

<hr>

<p>So, why didn't B use <code>!</code> for derefrencing a pointer like its predecessor BCPL did?</p>

<p>Well, BCPL was a bit wordy.  Instead of <code>&amp;&amp;</code> or <code>||</code> BCPL used <code>logand</code> and <code>logor</code>.  This was because most keyboards din't have <code>∧</code> or <code>∨</code> keys and not equal was actually the word <code>NEQV</code> (see <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/bcpl.pdf" rel="noreferrer">The BCPL Reference Manual</a>).</p>

<p>B appears to have been partially inspired to tighten up the syntax rather than have long words for all these logical operators that programmers did fairly frequently.  And thus <code>!</code> for dereference became <code>*</code> so that <code>!</code> could be used for logical negation.  Note there's a difference between the unary <code>*</code> operator and the binary <code>*</code> operator (multiplication).</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>Well, what about <em>other</em> options, like <code>-&gt;</code>?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <code>-&gt;</code> was taken for syntactic sugar around field derefrences <code>struct_pointer-&gt;field</code> which is <code>(*struct_pointer).field</code></p>

<p>Other options like <code>&lt;-</code> could create ambiguous parsings.  For example:</p>

<pre><code> foo &lt;- bar
</code></pre>

<p>Is that to be read as:</p>

<pre><code>(foo) &lt;- (bar)
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>(foo) &lt; (-bar)
</code></pre>

<p>Making a unary operator that is composed of a binary operator and another unary operator is quite likely to have problems as the second unary operator may be a prefix for another expression.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it is again important to try to keep the things being typed frequently to a minimum.  I would <em>hate</em> to have to write:</p>

<pre><code>int main(int argc, char-&gt;-&gt; argv, char-&gt;-&gt; envp)
</code></pre>

<p>This also becomes difficult to read.</p>

<p>Other characters might have been possible (the <code>@</code> wasn't used until <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/25749/289086">Objective C appropriated it</a>).  Though again, this goes to the core of 'C uses <code>*</code> because B did'.  Why didn't B use <code>@</code>?  Well, B didn't use all the characters.  There was no <code>bpp</code> program (compare <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_preprocessor" rel="noreferrer">cpp</a>) and other characters were available in B (such as <code>#</code> which was later used by cpp).</p>

<p>If I may hazard a guess as to why - its because of where the keys are.  From a <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/btut.pdf" rel="noreferrer">manual on B</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To facilitate manipulation of addresses when it seems advisable, B provides two unary address operators, <code>*</code> and <code>&amp;</code>. <code>&amp;</code> is the address operator so <code>&amp;x</code> is the address of <code>x</code>, assuming it has one. <code>*</code> is the indirection operator; <code>*x</code> means "use the content of x as an address."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that <code>&amp;</code> is shift-7 and <code>*</code> is shift-8.  Their proximity to each other may have been a hint to the programmer as to what they do... but that's only a guess. One would <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/252023/why-does-c-use-the-asterisk-for-pointers/273268#273268">have to ask Ken Thompson</a> about why that choice was made.</p>

<hr>

<p>So, there you have it.  C is that way because B was.  B is that way because it wanted to change from how BCPL was.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Many people have flipped coins but few have stopped to ponder the statistical and physical intricacies of the process. In a preregistered study we collected 350,757 coin flips to test the counterintuitive prediction from a physics model of human coin tossing developed by Persi Diaconis. The model asserts that when people flip an ordinary coin, it tends to land on the same side it started -- Diaconis estimated the probability of a same-side outcome to be about 51%. Our data lend strong support to this precise prediction: the coins landed on the same side more often than not, $\text{Pr}(\text{same side}) = 0.508$, 95% credible interval (CI) [$0.506$, $0.509$], $\text{BF}_{\text{same-side bias}} = 2364$. Furthermore, the data revealed considerable between-people variation in the degree of this same-side bias. Our data also confirmed the generic prediction that when people flip an ordinary coin -- with the initial side-up randomly determined -- it is equally likely to land heads or tails: $\text{Pr}(\text{heads}) = 0.500$, 95% CI [$0.498$, $0.502$], $\text{BF}_{\text{heads-tails bias}} = 0.183$. Furthermore, this lack of heads-tails bias does not appear to vary across coins. Our data therefore provide strong evidence that when some (but not all) people flip a fair coin, it tends to land on the same side it started. Our data provide compelling statistical support for Diaconis' physics model of coin tossing.

            <div>
                <p>Island management is a fundamental low level feature of physics engines and can have a big impact on solver design and performance. This was one of the first problems I decided to work on for Box2D version 3 (v3).</p>
<p>Since I began working on v3 I've been comparing several algorithms for island management. My goal has been to make island building scale better with multiple CPU cores. Here are the three approaches I've considered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Depth-first search (DFS)</li>
<li>Parallel union-find</li>
<li>Persistent islands</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's dive in!</p>
<h2 id="what-are-islands">What are islands?</h2>
<p>You can view a rigid body simulation as a graph where bodies are nodes and constraints are edges. Constraints consist of contacts (shapes touching) and joints (hinges, sliders, etc). From the graph point of view contacts and joints are the same.</p>
<p>In graph theory islands are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_(graph_theory)">connected components</a>. In rigid body simulation static bodies are not part of the graph. For example, this image shows three islands.</p>
<p><img src="https://box2d.org/images/islands.svg" alt="islands"><em>Islands</em></p>
<p>Static bodies are not part of the island graph because they can be shared among multiple islands. They <strong>need</strong> to shared because in a video game lots of bodies will be touching the static ground. Without sharing the static bodies among multiple islands there will be far fewer islands. Islands then lose their value. Islands are not required for correctness. They are an optimization (as we shall see) and they only work well as an optimization if there are many islands. Static bodies <strong>can</strong> be shared because nothing in the simulation affects their position or velocity. Sharing static bodies among multiple islands requires a little bit of care in the algorithms, but this is straight forward and for simplicity I will not include such logic in my examples.</p>
<p>In practice an island is a data structure that keeps track of a set of bodies and a set of constraints. This is the island data structure in Box2D v2.4:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>class</span> <span>b2Island</span>
{
    b2Body<span>*</span><span>*</span> bodies;
    b2Contact<span>*</span><span>*</span> contacts;
    b2Joint<span>*</span><span>*</span> joints;
    <span>int</span> bodyCount;
    <span>int</span> contactCount;
    <span>int</span> jointCount;
};
</code></pre></div><p>
The island uses arrays of pointers because the island does not own the bodies or constraints. An island is a subset of the simulation world.</p>
<p>Users of Box2D don't interact with islands. They are an implementation detail of the solver. Box2D v2.4 does not retain islands across time steps, so there is no way to access them.</p>
<h3 id="sleeping-and-waking">Sleeping and waking</h3>
<p>Islands are very useful in game physics. The most important aspect is sleeping. Sleeping rigid bodies are removed from the solver and this drastically reduces their CPU load. The engine checks islands during simulation for low energy. If all bodies in an island have low energy for several time steps, then all the bodies in the island are flagged as sleeping and no longer added to the active simulation. The Box2D debug display shows sleeping bodies as gray.</p>
<p><img src="https://box2d.org/images/sleep.png" alt="sleep"></p>
<p>Sleeping must be done per island, not per body. I made this mistake early in my work on game physics. If you put a body to sleep but not the whole island then you will see shapes begin to overlap and joints begin to dislodge.</p>
<p>Sleep has a flip side as well: waking.</p>
<p>Bodies wake other sleeping bodies through constraints and this must propagate through all touching bodies immediately. Otherwise you get those nasty overlapping shapes and dislodged joints. Islands are just as important for waking as for sleeping.</p>
<h3 id="parallel-islands">Parallel islands</h3>
<p>Islands work well for multicore simulation. Game worlds often have many separate islands of bodies. A ragdoll over here. A pile of debris over there. This relates to the concept of <em>spatial coherence</em> as described by Gino van den Bergen in his book <a href="http://dtecta.com/publications">Collision Detection in Interactive 3D Environments</a>. Spatial conherence says that rigid bodies tend to spread out and we can take advantage of this to improve performance and lower memory usage.</p>
<p>An island can be simulated indepedently from other islands. Therefore an island can be simulated on a thread and you can send multiple islands to multiple threads using a task system such as <a href="https://github.com/dougbinks/enkiTS">enkiTS</a>. This scales very well with CPU core count as long as there are a sufficient number of islands. This is also cache efficient because the core is doing significant work on a subset of the simulation world.</p>
<p>Parallel islands simulation is not a silver bullet. There may not be enough islands to span all the CPU cores. In some games there may be a large pile or tower of rigid bodies that are in a single island. This large single island can dominate performance even with multithreading. It can lead to a situation where many cores are sitting idle. I plan to discuss large islands in a future post.</p>
<p><img src="https://box2d.org/images/tower.jpg" alt="tower"><em>Large Island</em></p>
<h2 id="depth-first-search">Depth-first search</h2>
<p>Box2D v2.4 uses depth-first search <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search">DFS</a> to build islands from scratch every time step. Version 2.4 does not have multithreading support, so islands are only used for sleeping and waking.</p>
<p>The <code>SolveIslands</code> function takes all the bodies and constraints of the simulation world and finds their simulation islands. Before finding the islands, it clears a mark (visitation flag) on every body and constraint. These marks ensure that a body or constraint is only added to a single island.</p>
<p>The algorithm has a simulation island <em>G</em> that is reused for each island found. The island finder loops over all bodies and looks for awake dynamic bodies to be the <em>seed</em> for the island. Starting from the <em>seed</em>, connected bodies and constraints are added to <em>G</em>. Once all the connected bodies have been traversed the island <em>G</em> is simulated, updating the constraint forces and the body velocities and positions. Then the algorithm continues looking for the next seed body that hasn't already been simulated in the current time step.</p>
<pre><code>function SolveIslands(bodies, constraints)
    ClearMarks(bodies)
    ClearMarks(constraints)
    let G be an island

    for seed in bodies
        if seed not marked and seed is dynamic and seed is awake
            Clear(G)
            Mark(seed)
            let S be a stack
            S.Push(seed)
            while S not empty
                b = S.Pop()
                G.Add(b)
                for c in b.GetConstraints()
                    if c not marked
                        G.Add(c)
                        Mark(c)
                        other = OtherBody(c)
                        if other not marked
                            S.Push(other)
            G.Simulate()
</code></pre><p>DFS has linear time complexity in the number of bodies. It can be made faster by only using awake bodies as seeds. This can be done by keeping an array of awake dynamic bodies.</p>
<p>Traversal mark management can also be expensive. At the cost of more memory, each body and constraint can hold a time step counter. The DFS can then compare a body's time step counter with the current time step count of the physics world. Marking a body or constraint is done by setting the local time step counter equal to the world time step count.</p>
<p>The DFS naturally wakes bodies. When a body is added to an island it is flagged as awake. A body can only be flagged as sleeping with another routine called <code>IslandSleep</code>.</p>
<p>Part of island simulation is checking for sleeping. Every body has velocity and a sleep timer. If the velocity is greater than a velocity threshold then sleep timer is reset. Otherwise it is advanced by the time step. If the minimum sleep timer of all bodies in an island is greater than a <em>time to sleep</em> threshold then the entire island is marked as sleeping.</p>
<pre><code>function IslandSleep(islandBodies, timeStep)
    minSleepTime = MAX_FLOAT
    for b in islandBodies
        if b velocity &gt; velocityThreshold
            b.sleepTime = 0
            minSleepTime = 0
        else
            b.sleepTime += timeStep
            minSleepTime = Min(minSleepTime, b.sleepTime)

    if minSleepTime &gt; timeToSleep
        for b in islandBodies
            MarkSleeping(b)
</code></pre><p>Then the next time step no collisions between sleeping bodies are updated and sleeping bodies are not added to simulation islands unless an awake body begins interacting with a sleeping body. This is a huge win for performance in large game worlds.</p>

<h2 id="union-find">Union-find</h2>
<p>Union-find (UF) is a competitor to DFS for game physics island simulation. This algorithm is also called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure">Disjoint-set data structure</a>.</p>
<p>UF focuses on merging sets (islands). Each dynamic body starts alone in its own set. As constraints are added to the world the sets are merged. Within each set a single body is considered the root body and uniquely identifies the set. After all constraints have been added the union-find is complete.</p>
<p>This video series explains union-find very well: <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDV1Zeh2NRsBI1C-mR6ZhHTyfoEJWlxvq&amp;si=brluQ5CldgIXFMhv">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDV1Zeh2NRsBI1C-mR6ZhHTyfoEJWlxvq&amp;si=brluQ5CldgIXFMhv</a>. If you are not familiar with union-find and/or path compression, please go watch this and come back.</p>
<p>Like DFS, union-find (with path compression) has linear time complexity for building islands. Union-find can be a drop-in replacement for DFS. However, some additional care must be used to ensure that all touching bodies are woke up.</p>
<h2 id="the-amdahl-problem">The Amdahl problem</h2>
<p>DFS and UF are fast but they are not parallel algorithms. So when I began multithreading Box2D I started to get timing results like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://box2d.org/images/dfs_island.png" alt="island gap"></p>
<p>This is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law">Amdahl's law</a> in action. Multi-core scaling is limited by single-threaded processing. You will also notice a single-threaded broadphase section which I'll discuss in a future post.</p>
<h2 id="parallel-union-find">Parallel union-find</h2>
<p>At the GDC 2022, Jorrit Rouwe introduced a parallel union-find algorithm. The slides are <a href="https://gdcvault.com/play/1027560/Architecting-Jolt-Physics-for-Horizon">here</a>. You can also find an implementation in <a href="https://github.com/jrouwe/JoltPhysics">Jolt Physics</a>.</p>
<p>I implemented this algorithm in Box2D v3. In the process I learned a lot about using atomics and lock-free algorithms. If you want to learn more about atomics and the C/C++ memory model, I highly recommend this two-part video by Herb Sutter:</p>

<p>
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A8eCGOqgvH4" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</p>

<p>The first challenge I faced was making the algorithm recursive so that it would wake entire islands in one time step. I needed to add some additional iteration to ensure that all touching bodies are woken up. After fumbling with atomics a bit, I got something working.</p>
<p>However, I quickly ran into a problem and did a lot of head scratching trying to figure out the problem. Fortunately I still have plenty of hair.</p>
<p>Parallel union-find uses atomic compare-and-swap (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compare-and-swap">CAS</a>) when merging islands. This means the order of constraints in the resulting islands is non-deterministic. The final order depends on which core happens to be faster at completing the CAS. This can change dramatically across time steps and repeated runs of the application.</p>
<p>This is a serious problem for the solver used in game physics because the constraints are solved one at a time, sequentially. The results from each constraint propagate to the next constraint. This contraint solver algorithm is formally called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Seidel_method">Gauss-Seidel method</a>. The problem is magnified because Box2D uses <em>warm starting</em> for contacts, which gets confused when the contraint order varies each time step. You can read more about Gauss-Seidel and warm starting <a href="http://box2d.org/files/ErinCatto_IterativeDynamics_GDC2005.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>The constraints can be sorted after union-find and they can be sorted for each island independently. However, I could not find a faster way to do this than by using quicksort which is O(n log n). For large islands this added cost is significant, even when sorting a minimal index array. This video shows the effect of a parallel union-find and the resulting non-deterministic constraint order.</p>

</p>

<p>The serial DFS and UF do not have this problem. They generate constraints in a deterministic order. The loss of determinism is due to multithreading and the use of atomic CAS. If you want to learn more about determinism and multithreading, I recommend this video:</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What's next?</h2>
<p>After implementing the parallel union-find I took a step back and reconsidered my options and tried to look at the big picture.</p>
<p>First, I decided that I did not want to sacrifice determinism. As a programmer I value predictability in the software I write. Determinism affects my ability to debug and any Box2D user's ability to debug. I'm willing to give up performance for my software to be debuggable.</p>
<p>Second, Amdahl says that the serial part of a program dominates scaling. However, having a very fast serial part might be okay. Not every algorithm needs to be parallel if it is fast enough. So maybe I can find something faster than DFS or serial UF.</p>
<p>Third, Gino also describes <em>temporal coherence</em> in his book. Temporal coherence says the configuration of rigid bodies in a simulation does not change much across a single time step. How often do islands change? I suspect islands change slowly.</p>
<p>Fourth, maybe the cost of islands can be spread out in other ways. For example, it is urgent that islands are merged within the current time step. This is necessary to wake islands immediately. On the other hand it is not urgent to put islands to sleep or to split islands when bodies stop interacting. Delayed sleep is a minor performance loss.</p>
<h2 id="persistent-islands">Persistent islands</h2>
<p>The points above led to me investigate persistent islands. Persistent islands are retained across time steps. They need to support adding and removing bodies and contraints incrementally.</p>
<p>When a dynamic body is created it also creates a new island: an island of a single body. Static bodies do not get islands.</p>
<p>When a constraint between two dynamic bodies is created the two associated islands are merged. It may be the case that the bodies are already in the same island and this is an early out in the island merger.</p>
<p>When a dynamic body is destroyed it is removed from its island. If that island is now empty then the island is also destroyed.</p>
<p>When a constraint is destroyed then it is removed from the island. The island becomes a candidate for splitting.</p>
<p>I need to merge persistent islands immediately. This is necessary to ensure that all bodies that should be awake are added to the active simulation.</p>
<p>Persistent island splitting can be deferred. I can put a quota on island splitting. For example, one island per time step can split. Maybe I can choose to split the largest island first. Or maybe I can choose to split the island with the most constraints removed. Some heuristic can be used. I suspect any reasonable heuristic is fine.</p>
<p>I modified the v2.4 island structure to support adding and removing bodies and constraints quickly using linked lists. This also makes it fast to merge islands. Linked lists are slow to traverse because of cache misses, but I suspect I will not need to traverse them often. I also added a flag <code>maySplit</code> to indicate that the island has had contacts or joints removed and it may be possible to split the island into two or more islands.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>struct</span> b2Island
{
	<span>int</span> index;
	<span>int</span> parentIsland;

	<span>int</span> headBody;
	<span>int</span> tailBody;

	<span>int</span> headContact;
	<span>int</span> tailContact;

	<span>int</span> headJoint;
	<span>int</span> tailJoint;

	<span>bool</span> maySplit;
};</code></pre></div>
<p>If I have an existing set of islands I can add an edge and this may lead to two islands merging. Island merging should be fast and it has to be deterministic. I decided to stick with serial union-find for merging islands.</p>
<p>Here is the code for adding a contact constraint. Joints are similar. I abbreviated the code a bit and left out path compression. You can see the full version <a href="https://github.com/erincatto/box2c/blob/a0a9c6e72c9f2174fdf6582c5d4ba60f5343b2ba/src/island.c#L193">here</a>. Notice that islands are flagged as awake when they are merged.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>void</span> <span>b2LinkContact</span>(b2Island<span>*</span> islands, b2Body<span>*</span> bodyA, b2Body<span>*</span> bodyB, b2Contact<span>*</span> contact)

	}

	b2AddContactToIsland(rootA, contact);
}</code></pre></div>
<p>Removing a contact from an island involves linked list bookkeeping and flagging the island for spitting (<code>maySplit</code>). Union-find is not involved.</p>
<p>Once all the new constraints have been added to all islands, there is a serial merge step. Here is an abbreviated version of the code. The full version is <a href="https://github.com/erincatto/box2c/blob/a0a9c6e72c9f2174fdf6582c5d4ba60f5343b2ba/src/island.c#L578">here</a>. The function <code>b2MergeIslandWithParent</code> is just some boring bookkeeping code. Note that <code>b2DestroyIsland</code> invalidates the current island, so tread carefully.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>void</span> <span>b2MergeIslands</span>(b2Island<span>*</span> islands, <span>int</span> count)

    }

</code></pre></div>
<p>These code snippets show that union-find builds multiple island trees then collapses each island tree into its root island. With persistence this process can occur incrementally as shapes come into contact.</p>
<h2 id="island-splitting">Island splitting</h2>
<p>I handle island splitting by taking an island and using all of its bodies as seeds for the DFS algorithm. This could be done with union-find as well. Any island finding algorithm will do. I'm not really splitting the island, I just building new islands from the original island.</p>
<p>Because the island is guaranteed not to connect to other islands, the depth-first traversal is guaranteed to stay within the original island. This is critical to allow the original island to be split concurrently with other work.</p>
<p>Here is the pseudo-code for island splitting. It is very similar to the DFS algorithm above. Instead of dealing with all the bodies and constraints in the entire simulation world, it is limited to the bodies and constraints of a single island. After a new island is built, it is added to the world as a new persistent islands. After the island is split the original island is destroyed. This is fine because nothing should refer to the original island at this point.</p>
<pre><code>function SplitIsland(world, island)
    bodies = GetIslandBodies(island)
    constraints = GetIslandConstraints(island)
    ClearMarks(bodies)
    ClearMarks(constraints)

    let G be an island

    for seed in bodies
        if seed not marked and seed is dynamic and seed is awake
            Clear(G)
            Mark(seed)
            let S be a stack
            S.Push(seed)
            while S not empty
                b = S.Pop()
                G.Add(b)
                for c in b.GetConstraints()
                    if c not marked
                        G.Add(c)
                        Mark(c)
                        other = OtherBody(c)
                        if other not marked
                            S.Push(other)
            world.AddIsland(G)

    world.DestroyIsland(island)
</code></pre><p>The result of splitting the island is one or more new islands. It is a little sad if only one new island results, but it would be the correct result. Removing a constraint may or may not cause and island to split into two islands. Determining whether an island will split or not is similar to the work of doing the DFS, so I might as well optimistically attempt to split the island.</p>
<h2 id="making-persistent-islands-fast">Making persistent islands fast</h2>
<p>While working on parallel union-find I learned that the narrow-phase can drive island management. The narrow-phase is the simulation stage where contact points are computed between colliding shapes. The contact pairs that manage potentially colliding shapes are persisted across time steps. Each contact pair holds the current contact points. The number of contact points is 0, 1, or 2. If the number of contact points changes from zero to non-zero or vice-versa then there is an edge that should be added or removed from the island graph.</p>
<p>Scalability requires the narrow-phase to be executed in parallel. This is a naturally parallel algorithm because the contact points between one shape pair are not affected by other shape pairs. This is the easiest part of a physics engine to spread across multiple cores. Like butter on bread.</p>
<p>When a contact pair is updated there are three outcomes relevant to persistent islands:</p>
<ol>
<li>edge added</li>
<li>edge removed</li>
<li>unchanged</li>
</ol>
<p>The gambit is that most pairs fall in the third camp in a typical game scenario. This seems to be the case so far in my testing.</p>
<p>Edge additions need to be processed right away, before the islands are solved. I handle this with serial union-find as described above. Edge removals are less urgent. The contact constraint needs to be removed right away, but the island doesn't need to be split. Removing and edge doesn't mean the island will split. There may be other edges holding the island together. However, the island might split. So I flag the island as potentially splitting.</p>
<p>I can defer island splitting to later. For example, I can split an island after it has been solved, in the same task. This works because island A doesn't care if island B is split. Island A only cares if island B wants to merge with it. And merging is handled serially.</p>
<p>How about determinism? Determinism is maintained if the edge additions and removals are processed in deterministic order. It turns out in Box2D that the order of contact pairs in the world is deterministic, so I just need to process the edge changes according to the order of the contact pairs. However, there can be a huge number of contact pairs and looping over all the pairs serially looking for changes is going to be very slow.</p>
<p>There is one data structure that can have an large number of entries and still be fast to iterate across. The bit array! Modern CPUs help us do this quickly with bit scanning intrinsics. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Find_first_set">this</a> and <a href="https://lemire.me/blog/2018/02/21/iterating-over-set-bits-quickly/">this</a>.</p>
<p>The bit array can also work well with multithreading. Each narrow-phase worker can access a thread context that holds a local bit array. When the contact pair has an edge add or remove outcome, it flips a bit in the thread context bit array. Then after the narrow phase is complete, the main thread can bit-wise OR all the bit arrays together. This is quite fast using a bit array built on 64-bit words. And no atomics are needed.</p>
<p>Putting this all together I have the program flow shown below. This example has three threads in the narrow phase. Each thread gets its own bit array which is initially all zeros. When a contact pair is processed it checks if the number of contact points went from 0 to non-zero or vice-versa. In either case it sets the thread's bit array at the index associated with the contact pair. After all contact pairs are processed the bits from each thread are combined into a global bit array using bit-wise OR. Then a loop iterates over the global bit array looking for set bits. If a set bit is found, the code looks up the contact pair and determines if an edge should be added or removed from the island graph and then does that work. These additions and removals are done serially in the main thread. This retains a deterministic constraint order.</p>
<p><img src="https://box2d.org/images/persistent_island_bits.svg" alt="persistent island flow"><em>Persistent island program flow</em></p>
<p>In practice the number of set bits is very small. Bit traversal is very fast, even for a large number of contact pairs.</p>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>And performance? Performance is good. Gino was right!</p>
<p>This image shows a typical timing result. The blue bars are the contact pairs and the yellow bars are the island constraint solvers. The gap in between is the serial island management. The gap also includes island solver preparation and task system overhead.</p>
<p><img src="https://box2d.org/images/persistent_islands.png" alt="persistent island performance"></p>
<p>Let's look at some benchmarks.</p>
<p>The first test is 182 pyramids with a base of 10 boxes, so 55 bodies each and a total of 10010 bodies. These pyramids are not moving and so this test favors persistent islands.</p>
<p><img src="https://box2d.org/images/pyramid_benchmark.png" alt="pyramid benchmark"></p>
<p>The tumbler test has 2000 boxes inside a hollow box that is constantly rotating on a revolute joint. This test should be difficult for persistent islands because constraints are constantly being added and removed. The darker boxes are colored that way because Box2D considers them fast enough to engage continuous collision checks.</p>
<p><img src="https://box2d.org/images/tumbler_benchmark.png" alt="tumbler benchmark"></p>
<p>Here are the results for the two tests. Times are in milliseconds. The first time value is the average and the value in parentheses is the maximum. For DFS I'm using <a href="https://github.com/erincatto/box2c/commit/e105c0c3787d485ae3796f83cef301664dd88911">commit #32</a> of Box2D v3. For persistent islands I'm using <a href="https://github.com/erincatto/box2c/commit/96c9978577d21d856b09e6a775d4e63d5643a24f">commit #36</a>.</p>
<p>For persistent islands there can be many frames in a row where the island management has no work, making it tricky to benchmark. Persistent islands are strangly fast. I had to verify the code was working a few times. Indeed it is doing real work as I have tested island merging and splitting as well as sleeping and waking.</p>
<p>Take the maximums with a grain of salt. They could be due to anything. I include them because the persistent island has a heavier load when the bodies are created and this is relevant to avoid frame rate dips.</p>

</table>
<p>Persistent islands are roughly an order of magnitude faster than DFS.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-splitting">What about splitting?</h2>
<p>The current implementation uses DFS to split at most one island per time step. My current heuristic is to split the largest island that has had one or more constraints removed.</p>
<p>Island splitting isn't free but it is usually easy to hide the cost. I have experimented with putting the island splitting at the end of an island solve task. When there are many islands and multiple cores then this time is almost completely hidden and insignificant, amounting to a few microseconds on a single core.</p>
<p>If there are a small number of large islands then the cost of splitting can be significant. Nevertheless, island splitting can be done in parallel with other work and this is a significant gain over the traditional serial DFS/UF.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>I covered a lot of material in this post and there are a lot of references and auxilliary knowledge. Simulation islands touch a lot of systems, so it is challenging to fully understand islands without understanding how a physics engine is put together. Hopefully I've provided enough background knowledge so you can understand the scope of island mangement. If not, please let me know!</p>
<p>These are the main takeaways I have learned or reinforced while working on islands:</p>
<ul>
<li>island management can become a bottleneck in multicore simulation</li>
<li>determinism is important for game physics</li>
<li>spatial and temporal coherence provide many opportunities for improving performance</li>
<li>sometimes a fast serial algorithm may be better than a parallel algorithm</li>
<li>bit arrays are awesome!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whats-next-1">What's next?</h2>
<p>At the end of this journey I have many tools to work with islands. This will help me as I explore other aspects of improving Box2D.</p>
<p>There is more work to do on Box2D and more to write up. I plan to post more in the future on broad-phase improvements and dealing with large islands. Stay tuned!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
								<p><a href="https://qconsf.com/speakers/paulbakker">Paul Bakker</a>, Java Platform at Netflix, Java Champion, and Co-Author of "Java 9 Modularity," presented <a href="https://qconsf.com/presentation/oct2023/how-netflix-really-uses-java">How Netflix Really Uses Java</a> at the 2023 <a href="https://qconsf.com/">QCon San Francisco</a> conference.</p>

<p>Bakker put an end to the myth that "Netflix is all RxJava microservices with Hystrix and Spring Cloud and Chaos Monkeys running the show."</p>

<p>Bakker described the original architecture behind the familiar Netflix movie application, accessed via television and other devices, that connects to their Groovy-enabled API server using REST and gRPC connections to their various services.</p>

<p><img alt="" data-src="news/2023/10/java-at-netflix-bakker/en/resources/1infoq-netflix-architecture-01-1696877032453.png" src="https://imgopt.infoq.com/fit-in/1200x2400/filters:quality(80)/filters:no_upscale()/news/2023/10/java-at-netflix-bakker/en/resources/1infoq-netflix-architecture-01-1696877032453.png" rel="share"></p>

<p>The first upgrades featured multiple remote calls, parallel computing and fault tolerance implemented with RxJava and Hystrix. However, there were limitations such as: a script required for each endpoint, UI developers who generally don't like Groovy and Java; and the fact that reactive programming is hard.</p>

<p><img alt="" data-src="news/2023/10/java-at-netflix-bakker/en/resources/1infoq-netflix-architecture-02-1696877032453.png" src="https://imgopt.infoq.com/fit-in/1200x2400/filters:quality(80)/filters:no_upscale()/news/2023/10/java-at-netflix-bakker/en/resources/1infoq-netflix-architecture-02-1696877032453.png" rel="share"></p>

<p>Bakker then introduced the GraphQL Federation, an architecture model that allows multiple GraphQL services, known as subgraphs or federated services, to be combined into a single schema or API, and the concept behind GraphQL as an alternative to the over-fetching and under-fetching issues inherent in REST.</p>

<p>Their GraphQL Federated Gateway connecting to Domain Graph Services (DGS) essentially replaced the original API server to communicate with the various services via gRPC. Benefits included: no API duplication; no server-side development for the UI developers; a shared GraphQL schema; and no Java client libraries.</p>

<p><img alt="" data-src="news/2023/10/java-at-netflix-bakker/en/resources/1infoq-netflix-architecture-03-1696877032453.png" src="https://imgopt.infoq.com/fit-in/1200x2400/filters:quality(80)/filters:no_upscale()/news/2023/10/java-at-netflix-bakker/en/resources/1infoq-netflix-architecture-03-1696877032453.png" rel="share"></p>

<p>Java remains in active development at Netflix. They support Azul Zulu 17, Azul's downstream distribution of OpenJDK, with active testing on JDK 21, running approximately 2800 applications built with approximately 1500 libraries. Gradle along with <a href="http://nebula-plugins.github.io/">Nebula</a>, a collection of Gradle plugins built by Netflix, and IntelliJ IDEA are their preferred build tools.</p>

<p>Bakker provided a retrospective of their JDK 17 upgrade that provided performance benefits, especially since they were running JDK 8 as recently as this year. Netflix observed a 20% increase of CPU usage on JDK 17 compared to JDK 8. This was mostly due to the improvements in the G1 garbage collector.</p>

<p>Netflix is actively testing on JDK 21, and Bakker feels that a subsequent upgrade to JDK 21 will be much easier and faster. The use of Generational ZGC will be a much better fit for a variety of workloads at Netflix and they will ultimately replace their thread pools with virtual threads. But "virtual threads are not a free lunch," Bakker maintained, as he warned that simply adding virtual threads to an application can actually decrease performance if the libraries are CPU intensive.</p>

<p>Netflix also supports Spring Cloud with <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-netflix">Spring Cloud Netflix</a>, a subproject that provides Netflix open-source software integrations for Spring Boot apps.</p>

      Charles “Chuck” Feeney, a retail entrepreneur and investor who amassed a multibillion-dollar fortune and then gave it all away, has died. He was 92.
  </p>

      He died peacefully in San Francisco on Monday, the Atlantic Philanthropies, Feeney’s foundation, said on <a href="https://www.atlanticphilanthropies.org/news/the-atlantic-philanthropies-community-mourn-the-loss-of-founder-charles-f-feeney" target="_blank">its website</a>.

      Feeney made much of his fortune after co-founding Duty Free Shoppers, a chain of duty-free airport stores specializing in luxury goods, in 1960 with an undergraduate classmate from Cornell University. 
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/paragraph_7D260FD5-DE02-DF84-EC30-16706895B183@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      In 1996, Feeney sold his shares in DFS to French luxury goods conglomerate LVMH, which now owns a majority stake in the retailer. DFS has more than 850 boutiques spanning multiple continents, <a href="https://www.dfs.com/en/los-angeles/who-we-are" target="_blank">according</a> to the brand’s website.  
  </p>

      Feeney was a proponent of “Giving While Living,” believing he could make more of a difference in causes he cared about while he was alive, rather than setting up a foundation after he died, according to the Atlantic Philanthropies. 
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/paragraph_6527BDC2-1C0C-F13C-46AD-162D524D6D3D@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      “It’s much more fun to give while you are alive than to give when you are dead,” Feeney said in a biography about him, “The Billionaire Who Wasn’t.” 
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/paragraph_15217409-D73D-8899-A15D-1630C1C2643E@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      Feeney set up the Atlantic Philanthropies in 1982, transferring all of his business assets to it two years later, according to the foundation. In 2020, the foundation closed its doors after it said it had successfully given away all of its funds.
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/paragraph_0FDA56F0-7636-1733-F4E8-16338AD94049@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      In total, the Atlantic Philanthropies made grants totaling $8 billion across five continents — much of it anonymously, the foundation said. Donations supported education, health care, human rights and more. Feeney’s foundation donated to infrastructure in Vietnam, universities in Ireland and medical centers devoted to finding cures for cancer and cardiovascular disease, according to the foundation’s<a href="https://www.atlanticphilanthropies.org/our-story" target="_blank"> website</a>. 
  </p>

      Feeney chose to live the last three decades of his life frugally, his foundation said: He did not own a car or home, preferring to live in a rented apartment in San Francisco, according to the foundation.  
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/paragraph_7819CCB1-3D95-F319-5C8D-164200775F08@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      Feeney was born into a working-class Irish-American family during the Great Depression in Elizabeth, New Jersey, enrolling in Cornell University in 1952 with support from the GI Bill. He was the first in his family to go to college. 
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/paragraph_582BA497-208A-B777-C7B0-163F75D68077@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      Feeney has been referred to as Cornell’s “third founder” due to the magnitude of his investment in the university. He gave nearly $1 billion to Cornell through his foundation since 1982, according to an obituary on <a href="https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2023/10/chuck-feeney-cornells-third-founder-dies-92" target="_blank">Cornell’s website</a>.

      In 2011, Feeney signed the “Giving Pledge,” a commitment started by Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett that encourages America’s wealthiest families and individuals to dedicate their wealth to philanthropic endeavors. 
  </p>

      “I cannot think of a more personally rewarding and appropriate use of wealth than to give while one is living — to personally devote oneself to meaningful efforts to improve the human condition,” Feeney <a href="https://givingpledge.org/pledger?pledgerId=195" target="_blank">wrote</a> in his pledge letter.

<p>Not reproducible with SeaMonkey 2.53.14, so maybe this isn't a Core product issue after all, or maybe SeaMonkey has done something to override the bad behaviour.  Maybe the Firefox and Thunderbird developers can see what SeaMonkey has done to fix the issue and implement the same fix.</p>

<p>For people who find this page via search engine, like me, the solution I'm using is to disable tooltips entirely, with the setting <code>browser.chrome.toolbar_tips</code>. It's a weird thing to have to resort to, but I don't think there's really any situation where I'll miss them.</p>

After they ran up against that limit, too, Bankman-Fried asked him to set it to a number so large that they wouldn’t likely hit the limit. At that point, Wang set it to around $65 billion.</span></p><p>Finally, prosecutors questioned Wang about the FTX “insurance fund”, which was ostensibly supposed to protect both FTX and its customers from trades that went badly even more quickly than the exchange’s risk engine could account for. FTX published the fund’s supposed balance on their website, and bragged widely about its existence, including in testimony to U.S. Congress. However, according to Wang, the number shown on the website was falsified.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6448891-80fd-446a-b739-bb72b186f84c_1030x630.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6448891-80fd-446a-b739-bb72b186f84c_1030x630.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6448891-80fd-446a-b739-bb72b186f84c_1030x630.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6448891-80fd-446a-b739-bb72b186f84c_1030x630.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6448891-80fd-446a-b739-bb72b186f84c_1030x630.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6448891-80fd-446a-b739-bb72b186f84c_1030x630.png" width="514" height="314.3883495145631" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b6448891-80fd-446a-b739-bb72b186f84c_1030x630.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:630,&quot;width&quot;:1030,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:514,&quot;bytes&quot;:138239,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Tweet: FTX @FTX_Official The 5.25 million FTT we put in our insurance fund in 2019 now makes the fund worth over 100 million USD  Screenshot: Backstop Fund Size: 5,478,274.51613972 USD, 5,250,000.00000000 FTT Last updated: 14/02/2021, 08:05:00&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="Tweet: FTX @FTX_Official The 5.25 million FTT we put in our insurance fund in 2019 now makes the fund worth over 100 million USD  Screenshot: Backstop Fund Size: 5,478,274.51613972 USD, 5,250,000.00000000 FTT Last updated: 14/02/2021, 08:05:00" title="Tweet: FTX @FTX_Official The 5.25 million FTT we put in our insurance fund in 2019 now makes the fund worth over 100 million USD  Screenshot: Backstop Fund Size: 5,478,274.51613972 USD, 5,250,000.00000000 FTT Last updated: 14/02/2021, 08:05:00" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6448891-80fd-446a-b739-bb72b186f84c_1030x630.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6448891-80fd-446a-b739-bb72b186f84c_1030x630.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6448891-80fd-446a-b739-bb72b186f84c_1030x630.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6448891-80fd-446a-b739-bb72b186f84c_1030x630.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Tweet, exhibit GX-751</figcaption></figure></div><blockquote><p>AUSA: Is it a real number?</p><p>Wang: No.</p><p>AUSA: So it’s a fake number?</p><p>Wang: Yes.</p><p>AUSA: Was the real number higher or lower than the fake number?</p><p>Wang: Lower.</p></blockquote><p>Code snippets shown to the jury demonstrated how Nishad Singh wrote some code that would update the insurance fund amount by adding to it the daily trading volume, multiplied by a randomish number around 7,500, and dividing it by a billion, thus making it appear as though the website was referencing a real account balance that was fluctuating as the exchange added funds or withdrew from it to cover losses.

Wang said that Bankman-Fried reasoned “that FTX’s balance sheets are more public than Alameda’s balance sheets, that investors have access to FTX’s finances but not Alameda’s finances.”</p><p>Indeed, just the previous day we had heard testimony from Paradigm venture capitalist Matt Huang, during which balance sheets were shown to the jury that showed $63 million in estimated trading expenses and $63 million in estimated other expenses for all of 2021 — clearly omitting the “several hundred million dollars” lost to the MobileCoin incident.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd126406b-d72b-467c-ac2b-9237b4c4849a_1200x20.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd126406b-d72b-467c-ac2b-9237b4c4849a_1200x20.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd126406b-d72b-467c-ac2b-9237b4c4849a_1200x20.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd126406b-d72b-467c-ac2b-9237b4c4849a_1200x20.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd126406b-d72b-467c-ac2b-9237b4c4849a_1200x20.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd126406b-d72b-467c-ac2b-9237b4c4849a_1200x20.png" width="1200" height="20" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d126406b-d72b-467c-ac2b-9237b4c4849a_1200x20.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:20,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:5633,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd126406b-d72b-467c-ac2b-9237b4c4849a_1200x20.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd126406b-d72b-467c-ac2b-9237b4c4849a_1200x20.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd126406b-d72b-467c-ac2b-9237b4c4849a_1200x20.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd126406b-d72b-467c-ac2b-9237b4c4849a_1200x20.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>The defense team only briefly questioned Wang before the court session ended, but began by suggesting to the jury that he might be saying what the government wants to hear in the hopes of receiving a lighter sentence (he faces a maximum of 50 years in prison, but will likely receive a substantially shorter or even no custodial sentence due to his cooperation).

over the competition, was the official support for error-corrected memory (ECC RAM)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. With most Ryzen
1000 through 5000 series CPUs and the right motherboards, ordinary users could get ECC RAM going
without having to spring for more expensive workstation-grade CPUs.</p><figure><a href="https://sunshowers.io/images/b550-specs.png"><img src="https://sunshowers.io/images/b550-specs.png" alt="Screenshot of B550 Steel Legend specification page, showing support for ECC &amp; non-ECC, unbuffered memory"></a><figcaption>Specification page for the B550 Steel Legend motherboard.</figcaption></figure><p>For example, here’s the <a href="https://www.asrock.com/mb/AMD/B550%20Steel%20Legend/index.asp#Specification">specification

very happy with their motherboards in general.)</p><hr><figure><a href="https://sunshowers.io/images/x670e-specs.png"><img src="https://sunshowers.io/images/x670e-specs.png" alt="Screenshot of X670E Taichi specification page, without support for ECC memory"></a><figcaption>Specification page for the X670E Taichi motherboard, with no mention of ECC support.</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, when the AMD Ryzen 7000 “Raphael” CPUs were launched along with the brand new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socket_AM5">Socket

ASRock X670E Taichi, one of the most expensive AM5 motherboards you can buy, has <strong>no mention of ECC
support</strong> as of the date of writing this.</p><p>I still decided to upgrade to a Ryzen 7950X, and overall I’ve been happy with the performance of the new processor. But the lack of ECC was a huge bummer at the time of purchasing my system.</p><h2 id="finding-a-forum-link">Finding a forum link<a href="#finding-a-forum-link" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a></h2><p>A couple months ago I came across <a href="https://forum.asrock.com/forum_posts.asp?TID=24901">a topic on the ASRock
forums</a> talking about ECC support on AM5
motherboards, in which a user called ApplesOfEpicness said that they’d worked with an AMD engineer
to get ECC RAM going within AMD’s AGESA firmware. They’d claimed to have tested it on an ASRock
motherboard with an updated UEFI, by shorting ground and data pins, and seeing errors be reported up
to the OS.</p><p>I was intrigued by this! Even though I didn’t have the same motherboard that ApplesOfEpicness did, I
had chosen an ASRock board (the <a href="https://pg.asrock.com/mb/AMD/B650E%20PG%20Riptide%20WiFi/index.asp">B650E PG
Riptide</a>)—I had figured that
if ECC was possible on any AM5 board at all, it would be supported on ASRock. So based on the forum
post, last week I ordered <a href="https://v-color.net/products/ddr5-ecc-udimm-servermemory?variant=43445581906087">a pair of 32 GB server-grade ECC sticks from
v-color</a>.</p><p>I updated my motherboard’s UEFI to the latest version (version 1.28 with AGESA 1.0.0.7b), and then
replaced my existing RAM with the new sticks. I started up the system, and after a very long <a href="https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/news/boosing-memory-performance-age-ddr5-introduction-ddr-training-modes/">link

and why should we believe it?</p><p>Let’s look at <code>dmidecode</code> first. <code>man dmidecode</code> <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/8/dmidecode">starts with</a>:</p><blockquote><p>dmidecode is a tool for dumping a computer’s DMI (some say SMBIOS) table contents in a human‐readable format. This table contains a description of the system’s hardware components, as well as other useful pieces of information such as serial numbers and BIOS revision. Thanks to this table, you can retrieve this information without having to probe for the actual hardware. While this is a good point in terms of report speed and safeness, this also makes the presented information possibly unreliable.</p></blockquote><p>Oh, interesting, “possibly unreliable” is a little concerning! What is this SMBIOS thing anyway? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Management_BIOS">Wikipedia says</a>:</p><blockquote><p>In computing, the System Management BIOS (SMBIOS) specification defines data structures (and access methods) that can be used to read management information produced by the BIOS of a computer. This eliminates the need for the operating system to probe hardware directly to discover what devices are present in the computer.</p></blockquote><p>So the data presented by <code>dmidecode</code> is coming from the <em>UEFI</em>, not from the processor<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. What this means is that the memory is ECC-<em>capable</em>, but not necessarily that it is <em>active</em>. Whether ECC is active is ultimately determined by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_controller">memory controller</a> on the system.</p><h2 id="querying-the-memory-controller">Querying the memory controller<a href="#querying-the-memory-controller" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a></h2><p>When I mentioned setting up ECC at <a href="https://oxide.computer/">work</a>, <a href="https://fingolfin.org/blog/">Robert

AMD’s Unified Memory
Controller</a>.
I did some reading and learned that essentially, AMD processors expose a bus called the System
Management Network (SMN). Among other things, this bus can be used to query and configure the AMD
Unified Memory Controller (UMC).</p><div><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The information in the rest of this section is not part of the public AMD Processor
Programming Reference, but can be gleaned from the source code for the open-source Linux and
illumos kernels.</p><p><strong>WARNING:</strong> Accessing the SMN directly, and especially sending write commands to it, is dangerous
and can <strong>severely damage</strong> your computer. Do not write to the SMN unless you know what you’re
doing.</p></div><p>The idea is that we can ask the UMC the question “is ECC enabled” directly, by sending a read
request over the SMN to what is called the <code>UmcCapHi</code> register. The exact addresses involved are a
little bit magical, but on illumos with a Ryzen 7000 processor, here’s how you would query the UMC
over the SMN bus (channel 0 and channel 1 are the two memory channels on the system, and each
channel has one of the 32GB sticks plugged into it.)</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span><span># Query the UMC at address 0x50df4, representing channel 0</span>

to download and install (though on my system I needed to <a href="https://gitlab.com/leogx9r/ryzen_smu/-/merge_requests/10">apply a

means that, at least on AMD processors, the Linux kernel message <code>EDAC MC0: Giving out device to module amd64_edac</code> is a reliable indicator that ECC is enabled.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a></h2><p>ECC RAM is great, and you can easily get it working on Ryzen 7000 desktop CPUs, at least with ASRock

<p>Ursula von der Leyen and the European Commission 🇪🇺 launch an <strong>attack on our civil rights</strong> with chat control.🚩🚩🚩 </p>



<p>With the chat control, the European Commission wants to prevent the spread of child abuse depictions and grooming. You can find out <strong>why chat control</strong> is unfortunately <strong>the wrong tool</strong> here:</p>



<p>If the chat control detects suspicious content 🚨 – it will be forwarded to an authority. The two problems here:</p>



<p>1️⃣ Completely normal photos, such as holiday pictures 🏞️ are considered suspicious. The chat control therefore produces too <strong>many false results and overloads the authorities</strong>. This will lead to fewer investigation successes.</p>



<p>2️⃣ So our <strong>private family photos or the chats </strong>and pictures from your sexting yesterday 🍑🍆 also end up on an official table. So we can throw privacy in the bin 🚮</p>



<hr>



<div>
<p>The chat control is not in line with the Charter of Fundamental Rights⛔️ The digital secrecy of letters is thus going into the digital wastebasket 🚮 The chat control would read and screen all our WhatsApp messages, emails, photos and videos on our cell phone in real time 🔦</p>



<p>Minors are <strong>prohibited from accessing apps</strong> where there is a risk that adults could write to children illegally. So basically all common social media apps. Look for a leisure activity without an app 🙃</p>
</div>



<hr>



<div>
<p>WhatsApp, Snapchat etc. are forced to <strong>check the age</strong> of their users with chat control. The apps will have to do this with a photo and proof of <strong>passport</strong>. So you can forget about being anonymous on a dating app 🙅🙅‍♂️</p>



<div>
<p>The EU Data Protection Board, the European Parliament’s Research Service and the EU Council’s Legal Service say they are warning of chat controls. Ursula von der Leyen is not interested in these opinions </p>



<p>🤡 🚩</p>
</div>



<div>
<p>The <strong>chat control destroys the encryption infrastructure</strong> 🔐 Because it must always be possible to read the encrypted messages unencrypted. That’s the only way to check what’s inside. This means full monitoring of all news, including journalists, lawyers and political opponents in exile.</p>
</div>
</div>



<hr>



<div>
<p>Child protection can also be improved without chat control. Instead, investments must be made in equipping and training the judiciary, the police, Europol and in cooperation between the authorities 💶⚖️</p>



<p>EU member states already have sufficient powers to monitor criminal suspects on a case-by-case basis and to secure evidence 🚔</p>



<p>A general surveillance of our digital communication is more reminiscent of China than European values 👁️</p>

<p>“Chat control is dangerous for us as it threatens our privacy and freedom of expression. Through the monitoring and censorship of our online communication, we are restricted in our freedom to form opinions. It also opens the door to abuse and manipulation by governments and authoritarian organizations. It is important that we defend our rights to privacy and freedom of expression in order to maintain an open and democratic society.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" src="https://www.bram.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/css-light-dark.png" alt="" width="4162" height="1996" srcset="https://www.bram.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/css-light-dark.png 4162w, https://www.bram.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/css-light-dark-560x269.png 560w, https://www.bram.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/css-light-dark-1120x537.png 1120w, https://www.bram.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/css-light-dark-768x368.png 768w, https://www.bram.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/css-light-dark-1536x737.png 1536w, https://www.bram.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/css-light-dark-2048x982.png 2048w, https://www.bram.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/css-light-dark-1568x752.png 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 4162px) 100vw, 4162px"></p>
<p>To change a color based on whether Light Mode or Dark Mode used, you’d typically use a <code>prefers-color-scheme</code> Media Query. To make things easier, CSS now comes with a utility function named <code>light-dark()</code>. The function accepts two color values as its arguments. Based on which color scheme you are actively using, it will output the first or the second argument.</p>
<p>~</p>
<h3><a name="mq" href="#mq">#</a> Responding to Light or Dark Mode</h3>
<p>To change a color value – or any other value for that matter – based on Light Mode or Dark Mode being used, you’d typically use a <code>prefers-color-scheme</code> Media Query to change the value of a Custom Property:</p>
<pre><code>:root {
  --text-color: #333; /* Value for Light Mode */
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  --text-color: #ccc; /* Value for Dark Mode */
}</code></pre>
<p>When <a href="https://www.bram.us/2019/12/10/how-to-add-dark-mode-to-a-javascript-app-react-angular-vue-etc/">implementing Dark Mode</a>, you typically end up with a bunch of duplicated CSS variables that set the values for each mode. The rest of your CSS then uses these custom properties for the actual declarations.</p>
<pre><code>body {
  color: var(--text-color);
}</code></pre>
<p>~</p>
<h3><a name="light-dark" href="#light-dark">#</a> Responding to Light or Dark Mode with <code>light-dark()</code></h3>
<p>A new addition to the <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color-5/">CSS Color Module Level 5 Specification</a> is the <code>light-dark()</code> function. The function accepts two color values as its arguments. Based on which color scheme you are actively using, it will output the first or the second color argument.</p>
<pre><code>light-dark(&lt;color&gt;, &lt;color&gt;);</code></pre>
<p>As <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color-5/#light-dark">per spec</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>This function computes to the computed value of the first color, if the used color scheme is <code>light</code> or unknown, or to the computed value of the second color, if the used color scheme is <code>dark</code>.</p></blockquote>
<p>The used color scheme is not only based on the users Light/Dark Mode setting, but also on the value of the <code>color-scheme</code> property. This similar to how <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2021/css-system-colors/">System Colors</a> get computed.</p>
<blockquote><p>The <code>color-scheme</code> property allows an element to indicate which color schemes it is designed to be rendered with. These values are negotiated with the user’s preferences, resulting in a used color scheme […].</p></blockquote>
<p>That means, for <code>light-dark()</code> to work, you <strong>must</strong> also include a <code>color-scheme</code> declaration.</p>
<pre><code>:root {
  color-scheme: light dark;
}

:root {
  --text-color: light-dark(#333, #ccc); /* In Light Mode = return 1st value. In Dark Mode = return 2nd value. */
}</code></pre>
<p>Because <code>color-scheme</code> is taken into account, that also means that you can override its value per element, to force it into a certain mode:</p>
<pre><code>.dark {
  color-scheme: dark; /* light-dark() on this element and its children will always return dark */
}</code></pre>
<div>
<p>🤔 If this <code>light-dark()</code> seems familiar: Chromium internally sports a <code>-internal-light-dark()</code> which <a href="https://www.bram.us/2022/01/11/customize-the-password-hide-reveal-button-in-microsoft-edge/#light-dark">I wrote about before</a>. Based on this functionality, <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/7561">the proposal was made within the CSS Working Group</a> to expose a similar function to authors. The result is <code>light-dark()</code>.</p>
<p>Unlike <code>-internal-light-dark()</code> which is for any type of value, <code>light-dark()</code> can only be used for colors.</p></div>
<p>~</p>
<h3><a name="schemed-value" href="#schemed-value">#</a> What about other non-<code>&lt;color&gt;</code> values and responding to other color schemes?</h3>
<p>Yes, <code>light-dark()</code> is fairly limited in what it can do: it can only do light/dark and only return <code>&lt;color&gt;</code> values. But that’s intentional, as it is an intermediary step towards a final solution.</p>
<p>As proposed in <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/7561">the CSS Working Group issue</a>, the end goal is to have a function <em>(tentatively)</em> named <code>schemed-value()</code> in the future. That function can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Respond to any value of <code>color-scheme</code>.</li>
<li>Return more than <code>&lt;color&gt;</code> values</li>
</ul>
<p>It <em>could</em> look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>:root {
  color-scheme: dark light custom;
}

body {
  color: schemed-value(light hotpink, dark lime, custom rebeccapurple);
}</code></pre>
<p>But, for now, we “only” have <code>light-dark()</code> and I personally think that’s fine, as it rhymes with today’s reality of what browsers can do:</p>
<ul>
<li>It only supports <code>light</code> or <code>dark</code> because browsers right now <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color-adjust/#color-scheme-prop:~:text=%3Ccustom%2Dident%3E%20values%20are%20meaningless%2C%20and%20exist%20only%20for%20future%20compatibility%2C%20so%20that%20future%20added%20color%20schemes%20do%20not%20invalidate%20the%20color%2Dscheme%20declaration%20in%20legacy%20user%20agents">don’t support <code>&lt;custom-ident&gt;</code> in <code>color-scheme</code></a>, so there’s no use in supporting other values right now.</li>
<li>It can only do <code>&lt;color&gt;</code> values because <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/#parse-grammar">the parser needs to know the value type of what it is parsing</a> ahead of time. <code>light-dark()</code> is <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color-5/#color-syntax">explicitly defined to be a <code>&lt;color&gt;</code></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Narrowing things down in scope/things it can do, allowed <code>light-dark()</code> to be defined now, instead of putting it on the long track. The name and syntax of <code>light-dark()</code> that was resolved on is very memorable, easy to use, and offers a solution to a common use-case.</p>
<div>
<p>When <code>schemed-value()</code> ever becomes a thing, <code>light-dark()</code> would become <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar">syntactic sugar</a> for it.</p>
<pre><code>light-dark(&lt;color&gt;, &lt;color&gt;); = schemed-value(light &lt;color&gt;, dark &lt;color&gt;);</code></pre>
</div>

</div><p>John Riccitiello, CEO of <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/unity-adds-fee-for-installs-for-successful-developers-triggering-a-backlash/">Unity</a>, has resigned from the company in the wake of a pricing controversy that left developers in open revolt. </p>



<p>Unity said in a press release that James M. Whitehurst has been appointed interim CEO and president of the company. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, hoping to avoid a stock panic, Unity said that it is reaffirming its previous guidance for its fiscal third quarter financial results, which will be reported on November 9. </p>



<p>Roelof Botha, lead independent director of the Unity board, has been appointed chairman. Riccitiello will continue to advise Unity to ensure a smooth transition, the company said. The news isn’t a surprise as Unity angered a lot of its loyal game developers a few weeks ago after pushing through a price increase based on numbers of downloads — and then retracted it after an uproar.</p>

                        </p></div><p>Unity said the board will initiate a comprehensive search process, with the assistance of a leading executive search firm, to identify a permanent CEO.</p>



<p>“Working with Unity under John’s leadership has been one of the highlights of my career. John joined the Unity Board in 2013 and stepped in to lead the company in 2014, at a time when we faced significant challenges,” Botha said, in a statement. “John has led Unity through incredible growth over the last nearly 10 years, helping us transition from a perpetual license to a subscription model, enabling developers to monetize, building other game services to serve our creator community, leading us through an IPO and positioning us as a pioneer in the developer community. Unity would not be where it is today without the impact of his contributions. I remain excited for the future of Unity.”</p>



<p>“It’s been a privilege to lead Unity for nearly a decade and serve our employees, customers, developers and partners, all of whom have been instrumental to the company’s growth,” Riccitiello said in a statement. “I look forward to supporting Unity through this transition and following the company’s future success.”</p>



<p>Whitehurst is a seasoned technology and public company executive. He previously served as senior advisor and president at IBM, after joining through IBM’s acquisition of Red Hat, a leading provider of open-source enterprise IT products and services, where he served as president and CEO from 2008 to 2020.</p>



<p>“I am honored to join Unity as interim CEO and President at this important time in its evolution,” Whitehurst said in a statement. “With the company’s experienced leadership and passionate employees, I am confident that Unity is well-positioned to continue enhancing its platform, strengthening its community of customers, developers and partners, and focusing on its growth and profitability goals. I look forward to working closely with the Board and our talented global team to execute on our strategy, and I anticipate a seamless transition.”</p>



<p>Unity will release third quarter 2023 financial results after the market close on Thursday, November 9, 2023, with a webcast to follow at 2 p.m. PT. </p>

It is also very important to understand the volume of data, ingestion time requirement, search latency, cost, and more to properly plan and deploy the right infra/compute. All of these are core engineering problems that, albeit solved, are daunting to implement.</li><li id="b237">Embedding (transforming it into vector format for low-latency semantic search) — generating embeddings is not a problem except when you have large data and have to deal with rate limits, retry logic, self hosted models, and more. Not to mention, but <strong>syncing data</strong> becomes crucial here. If something changed at the source and not at the downstream vector database — where the AI application typically queries from — then the response from the AI application will be stale and inaccurate. Embeddings can be costly if not done efficiently. There will always be a one-time cost of embedding all the data, but for an application that relies on new/changed data, embedding all of the source data can be very expensive, and so, there has to be a mechanism to detect whether or not data needs to be re-embedded.</li></ol><p id="adfc">In this specific case, our data pipeline is responsible for 3 operations.</p><p id="e1f2">a) Reading data</p><p id="2f15">b) Processing data</p><p id="ac67">c) Embedding data</p><p id="1c73">d) Storing data in a vector database — in this case Weaviate!</p><p id="89f4">Each of the points above have their own challenges.</p><ol><li id="5c91">Reading data needs to be done efficiently and attempt to maximize parallelization to meet ingestion time requirements</li><li id="b5a3">Once data is read, it needs to be processed, we can’t just dump everything to an embedding model.

This queue is responsible for taking in the request, figuring out the source type, in this specific case we were processing lots of files from an S3 bucket.</li><li id="418f">For each of the file in the S3 bucket, send an event to <code>process_document</code> queue with the file name where other consumers will read messages from. These workers will read the file and start processing it.</li><li id="19ea">For each of the processed files we will split it into chunks (if the file is large) so that we can fit within memory and other resource constraints. Each of these chunks will be sent to <code>embed_store</code> - our final one queue, promise ;) - where other consumers will be dequeuing.</li><li id="7a80">Of course we have set up logs and monitoring in place for us to detect issues and be able to surface any important status messages/codes to the user upon requested. Additionally, we care about analytics and metrics such as average time taken, number of tasks, etc. and we display those as well upon request.</li></ol><h2 id="f051">A note on distributed queueing in Python</h2><p id="f736">While FastAPI has support for <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/background-tasks/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">BackgroundTasks</a>, we chose <a href="https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/getting-started/introduction.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Celery</a> to help us handle the abstractions between our Message Broker and our workers because this is a more intense-heavy operation which requires distributed logging, monitoring, and further parallelization. Because the work is distributed across multiple machines, having a message broker and an event-driven system is vital for the processing and monitoring of tasks.</p><figure><figcaption>Celery Task Queue — great intro <a rel="noopener" href="https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/python-celery-distributed-task-queue-demystified-for-beginners-to-professionals-part-1-b27030912fea">here</a></figcaption></figure><p id="219b">Celery is a vegetable ;), and it’s also an asynchronous task queue written in Python. It provides great abstractions from dealing with message brokers, producers, and consumers in a distributed system. There’s a lot of inner things about Celery that we could spend time talking about but we will leave those for another post. For example, took us a couple of debugging sessions to understand that our consumers were picking up jobs even though our message broker was empty… and it’s because Celery’s <code>prefetch_count</code>.</p><h2 id="18d3">Let’s go a bit in depth</h2><h2 id="4a41">Reading</h2><p id="4da5">As mentioned above, the first part of our system is the one in charge of determining the source type and distributing the files in this case for parallel reading. These tasks are sent to the <code>process_document</code> queue. Then, because the files might be large, we process each of them individually and sub divide it into chunks. These per-file chunks are then sent to the <code>embed_store</code> .</p><p id="395c">There’s a couple of important aspects here</p><ol><li id="b991">Because we process lots of data and files, our distributed queueing system built with Celery allows us to properly distribute tasks, monitor and retry them if needed. Along the way we have checkpointing mechanisms to understand what has been processed, which worker has picked up a task, what’s left, what succeeded and what failed.</li><li id="b3d8">Second, we need to be smart about how we chunk, how we assign metadata, and more. We give the user the ability to select how they want to chunk and assign metadata to their source data, but we also have incorporated smart chunking mechanisms to properly split the data accordingly. The data for this pipeline is json-based and so chunking is based on property field, same with the metadata to be used in the vector database for each of the vectors.</li></ol><p id="3f1b">Once we have finished distributing all the files and their respective subtasks we are ready for our final list of “heavy-consumers” to dequeue messages from our last queue depicted above and perform the <code>embeddings</code> and the <code>vector db storing</code></p><h2 id="a8c1">Embeddings and Vector DB storing</h2><p id="a886">Our final stage (which runs for every subtask mentioned above) is the one that will embed our chunks of data and store them into the vector database.</p><p id="2e47">For the case study we are talking about here, we chose two main technologies to assist with this.</p><ol><li id="2a18"><a href="https://replicate.com/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Replicate</a> for embeddings</li><li id="397f"><a href="https://weaviate.io/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Weaviate</a> for Vector Database</li></ol><p id="6f54">While we ended up using Replicate — specifically <a href="https://replicate.com/replicate/all-mpnet-base-v2" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">mpnet’s embedding model </a>— it is important to note that we did start with OpenAI embeddings and their <code>text-ada-002</code> model. This worked seamlessly and it took about 3-5 seconds to embed about 1500 different documents each with about 30 tokens each. Also, their <a href="https://openai.com/pricing" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">cost</a> was acceptable as well.</p><p id="4971">One thing to note is that storing vectors in a vector database has implications on a lot of things like latency for querying, storing, memory needed to manage it, and more. Because we are dealing with a large scale number of vectors, it was imperative to try and reduce the 1536 dimensions into a smaller dimensional model to avoid unnecessary memory storage and usage in the Weaviate cluster. Reducing the dimensions in half leads to huge $$ savings. While there are techniques to do <a href="https://elitedatascience.com/dimensionality-reduction-algorithms" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Dimensionality Reduction algorithms</a>, Neum also offers integration with Replicate where customers can choose their embeddings model of their choice to be hosted and we simply connect to it, which is what we did for this run. Replicate has great customer support and were able to handle this load seamlessly.</p><p id="683a">We need a powerful and efficient vector database capable of storing <strong>b</strong>illions of vectors. Weaviate is a popular one that has great support and very technical capabilities, for those who are interested and know, Weaviate is also built using Cassandra’s architecture for sharding and replication. Having had experience with this in the past and it being open-source, it was a good choice as we needed a lot of deep customization and integration like being able to deploy on a kubernetes cluster and choose the number of nodes and shards, adjust the number of workers and ingestion batch size, and more. There’s tons of great documentation on Weaviate <a href="https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p id="128e">The core here is to have a vector database that will be fast upon doing semantic search and also allowing parallelization of ingestion requests via multi-node cluster while offering logging and retry capabilities.</p><h2 id="3773">Storing in-depth</h2><p id="405e">So, going back to the beginning of this section, we had our chunks that needed to be embedded, we used Replicate to do so, with Dead-Letter-Queue and retry mechanisms in place. After we got our embeddings, we used Weaviate to store the data with all the configurations mentioned above and more. Again, logging and handling errors accordingly.</p><p id="4d72">To share some numbers, we ran benchmarks with different levels of parallelization from both our infra and Weaviate’s, as well as played with the number of CPUs in the Weaviate cluster. This is not a super extensive benchmark and was done at the beginning with OpenAI where the dimensions would be greater so as to plan for a “worst case” scenario. Also, there’s some other improvements we are in the process of trying out as well like using Weaviate’s <a href="https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate/tree/master/grpc" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">GRPC client</a> — which claims to have significantly faster ingestion times.</p><figure><figcaption>Fig 3 - some raw quick benchmarks of Neum and Weaviate ingestion</figcaption></figure><p id="6ab1">One key insight we had to pay attention to was on how to parallelize the writes to Weaviate.</p><p id="8091">So far we shared how we parallelized the requests, the files, the chunking and the embeddings, but when we get to the storing we have a choice of how much further to parallelize ingestion, specifically for Weaviate, as they have an option for users to specify <code>num_workers</code> when ingesting data, which essentially parallelizes the request on their end further.</p><p id="ce7b">Because we had a number of consumers dequeuing from <code>embed_store</code> (remember our queues and consumers ;) I know, lots of moving pieces, it isn’t trivial!) we were already parallelizing the ingestion requests to Weaviate, and so, we had to do benchmarks to understand the “magic number” of ingestion threads from our end and worker parallelization from Weaviate’s end.</p><p id="3386">The most important thing was to understand how many CPU cores does the Weaviate cluster have and how many parallel threads/number of workers are you actively using. We got hit initially by a number of “connection errors” and large ingestion times because we were over-parallelizing the requests. As long as you maximize but don’t go over your Weaviate cluster’s resources limits, you should be good.</p><p id="1115">There’s a lot of other learnings from the Weaviate side of things like Product Quantization, increased latency because identical vectors and how HNSW stores data, parallelization of Weaviate workers via sharding, and more. Let us know if you are interested in such an analysis and we’ll share some of those learnings in another post!</p><p id="2f62">As a side note, Neum’s platform works great with Weaviate with its deep integration but we support other vector DBs as well if the user prefers it.</p><h2 id="35f9">Conclusion</h2><p id="c772">Building distributed data pipelines have lots of moving pieces, and now with the rise of Generative AI and RAG-based applications, things can get complicated very fast. We keep learning and keep delving ourselves into all these new ideas and technologies popping up to ensure we stay up to date with the latest trends. However, having a robust system with retry, logging, monitoring and ease-of-use remains top priorities for us when supporting large-scale data pipelines for embeddings.</p><p id="ac6e">There’s a bunch of moving pieces as you probably figured out. The beautiful thing about this is that all of this happens within a single API request to our Neum AI platform :).

<p><em>This article is part of our&nbsp;coverage of the latest in&nbsp;<a href="https://bdtechtalks.com/tag/ai-research-papers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI research</a>.</em></p>



<p>Scientists are inventing various strategies to enhance the accuracy and reasoning abilities of large language models (<a href="https://bdtechtalks.com/tag/large-language-models/">LLM</a>) such as <a href="https://bdtechtalks.com/2023/04/03/augmented-language-models/" title="">retrieval augmentation</a> and chain-of-thought reasoning.</p>



<p>Among these, “self-correction”—a technique where an LLM refines its own responses—has gained significant traction, demonstrating efficacy across numerous applications. However, the mechanics behind its success remain elusive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01798">recent study</a> conducted by Google DeepMind in collaboration with the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign reveals that LLMs often falter when self-correcting their responses without external feedback. In fact, the study suggests that self-correction can sometimes impair the performance of these models, challenging the prevailing understanding of this popular technique.</p>



<h2>What is self-correction?</h2>



<div>




<p>Self-correction is predicated on the idea that LLMs can assess the accuracy of their outputs and refine their responses. For instance, an LLM might initially fail a math problem but correct its answer after reviewing its own output and reasoning.</p>
</div>



<p>Several studies have observed this process, also known as “self-critique,” “self-refine,” or “self-improve.”</p>



<p>However, the effectiveness of self-correction is not universal across all tasks. The paper from DeepMind and University of Illinois reveals that the success of self-correction is largely contingent on the nature of the task at hand. In reasoning tasks, self-correction techniques typically succeed only when they can leverage external sources, such as human feedback, an external tool like a calculator or code executor, or a knowledge base.</p>



<p>The researchers underscore the fact that high-quality feedback is not always accessible in many applications. This makes it crucial to understand the inherent capabilities of LLMs and to discern how much of the self-correction can be attributed to the model’s internal knowledge. They introduce the concept of “intrinsic self-correction,” which refers to a scenario where the model attempts to correct its initial responses based solely on its built-in capabilities, without any external feedback.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The researchers put self-correction to the test on several benchmarks that measure model performance in solving math word problems, answering multiple-choice questions, and tackling question-answering problems that require reasoning. They employed a three-step process for self-correction. First, they prompt the model for an answer. Next, they prompt it to review its previous response. Finally, they prompt it a third time to answer the original question based on its self-generated feedback.</p>



<p>Their findings reveal that self-correction works effectively when the models have access to the ground-truth labels included in the benchmark datasets. This is because the algorithm can accurately determine when to halt the reasoning process and avoid changing the answer when it is already correct. As the researchers state, “These results use ground-truth labels to prevent the model from altering a correct answer to an incorrect one. However, determining how to prevent such mischanges is, in fact, the key to ensuring the success of self-correction.”</p>



<p>However, this assumption does not reflect real-world scenarios, where access to the ground truth is not always available. If the ground truth were readily accessible, there would be no need to employ a machine learning model to predict it. The researchers demonstrate that when they remove the labels from the self-correction process, the performance of the models begins to decline significantly.</p>



<p>Interestingly, the models often produce the correct answer initially, but switch to an incorrect response after self-correction. For instance, in GPT-3.5-Turbo (the model used in the free version of <a href="https://bdtechtalks.com/2022/12/05/openai-chatgpt/">ChatGPT</a>), the performance dropped by almost half on the CommonSenseQA question-answering dataset when self-correction was applied. <a href="https://bdtechtalks.com/2023/03/20/gpt-4-applications-limits/">GPT-4</a> also exhibited a performance drop, albeit by a smaller margin.</p>

<p>According to the researchers, if the model is well-aligned and paired with a thoughtfully designed initial prompt, “the initial response should already be optimal given the conditions of the prompt and the specific decoding algorithm.” In this case, introducing feedback can be viewed as adding an additional prompt, potentially skewing the model’s response away from the optimal prompt. “In an intrinsic self-correction setting, on the reasoning tasks, this supplementary prompt may not offer any extra advantage for answering the question. In fact, it might even bias the model away from producing an optimal response to the initial prompt, resulting in a decrease in performance,” the researchers write.</p>



<p>Self-correction is also prevalent in multi-agent LLM applications. In these scenarios, multiple instances of an LLM, such as ChatGPT, are given different instructions to perform distinct roles in a multi-sided debate. For instance, one agent might be tasked with generating code, while another is instructed to review the code for errors.</p>



<p>In these applications, self-correction is implemented by instructing agents to critique each other’s responses. However, the researchers found that this multi-agent critique does not lead to any form of improvement through debate. Instead, it results in a form of “self-consistency,” where the different agents generate multiple responses and then engage in a form of majority voting to select an answer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Rather than labeling the multi-agent debate as a form of “debate” or “critique”, it is more appropriate to perceive it as a means to achieve “consistency” across multiple model generations,” the researchers write.</p>



<h2>Post-hoc vs pre-hoc prompting</h2>



<p>While self-correction may not enhance reasoning, the researchers found that it can be effective in tasks such as modifying the style of the LLM’s output or making the response safer. They refer to these tasks as “post-hoc prompting,” where the prompting is applied after the responses have been generated. They write, “Scenarios in which self-correction enhances model responses occur when it can provide valuable instruction or feedback that pre-hoc prompting cannot.”</p>



<p>Another key finding of the paper is that the improvement attributed to self-correction in certain tasks may be due to an inadequately crafted initial instruction that is outperformed by a carefully constructed feedback prompt. In such cases, incorporating the feedback into the initial instruction, referred to as the “pre-hoc prompt,” can yield better results and reduce inference costs. The researchers state, “It is meaningless to employ a well-crafted post-hoc prompt to guide the model in ‘self-correcting’ a response generated through a poorly constructed pre-hoc prompt. For a fair comparison, equal effort should be invested in both pre-hoc and post-hoc prompting.”</p>



<p>The researchers conclude by urging the community to approach the concept of self-correction with skepticism and to apply it judiciously.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It is imperative for researchers and practitioners to approach the concept of self-correction with a discerning perspective, acknowledging its potential and recognizing its boundaries,” the researchers write. “By doing so, we can better equip this technique to address the limitations of LLMs, steering their evolution towards enhanced accuracy and reliability.”</p>

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            Humans can perform parkour by traversing obstacles in a highly dynamic fashion requiring precise eyemuscle coordination and movement. Getting robots to do the same task requires overcoming similar challenges. Classically, this is done by independently engineering perception, actuation, and control systems to very low tolerances. This restricts them to tightly controlled settings such as a predetermined obstacle course in labs. In contrast, humans are able to learn parkour through practice without significantly changing their underlying biology. In this paper, we take a similar approach to developing robot parkour on a small low-cost robot with imprecise actuation and a single front-facing depth camera for perception which is low-frequency, jittery, and prone to artifacts. We show how a single neural net policy operating directly from a camera image, trained in simulation with largescale RL, can overcome imprecise sensing and actuation to output highly precise control behavior end-to-end. We show our robot can perform a high jump on obstacles 2x its height, long jump across gaps 2x its length, do a handstand and run across tilted ramps, and generalize to novel obstacle courses with different physical properties.

If the number of pods (<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">actually the required capacity of the pods</a>) reaches the capacity limit for the current node, it will auto-scale a new node and start launching new pods inside that node.</p><p id="843d">The load balancer in front of the API will share the HTTP calls randomly between all the existing pods to split the load.</p><p id="65a7">The worker polling the RabbitMQ is also auto-scaling, but it’s not on resources; it is scaling on the number of messages waiting in the queue. The more messages await, the faster we need to process them, so launching new workers is the way to go.</p><p id="181c">It’s much better, but we want to save costs when possible, so let me introduce <em>preemptible nodes</em>!</p><blockquote><p id="e0c7">Preemptible VMs are Compute Engine <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/preemptible" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">VM instances</a> that are priced lower than standard VMs and provide no guarantee of availability — <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/preemptible-vms" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Google Cloud documentation</a>.</p></blockquote><figure><figcaption>Custom-made schema representing the more complex architecture with Kubernetes and preemptible nodes.</figcaption></figure><p id="7098">We want our user to have the best experience, but it’s perfectly fine for us if they don’t have access to the best video quality in adaptative bitrate streaming format right as they upload their content. It can take a few minutes for a preemptible node to be available, but they are cheaper than a normal node.</p><p id="c20f">In this new schema, we transformed our NodeJS worker with FFmpeg to what we call internally a “spawner”. It still polls the RabbitMQ queue, but instead of processing the video itself, it will launch a new Kubernetes pod in a preemptible node, and this new pod will do the processing.</p><p id="bd2e">This way is cheaper. We switched all our resource-intensive tasks in a preemptible node, so we don’t need to scale our spawner as much in a normal-priced node.</p><p id="e538">Google Cloud can kill preemptible nodes if a normal node needs the resources. We must ensure a failed task goes back to the queue and starts again by another node later.</p><blockquote><p id="6026">Terminated when Compute Engine requires the resources to run standard VMs — <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/preemptible-vms#comparison_to" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Google cloud documentation</a></p></blockquote><p id="87f2">This new setup with preemptible nodes brings more overhead in the implementation but a significant price improvement. We reached a point where we could scale vertically indefinitely.</p></div><div><h2 id="6d42">Second step: Video playback</h2><p id="7539">Alright, at this point in the process, we uploaded and transformed our user video to stream it on our site. A video could be hundreds of megabytes split into thousands of chunks.</p><p id="eeed">The video HTML tag does not support adaptative bitrate streaming formats like HLS or MPEG-Dash by default, so we must use a custom player. The two most used players to handle streaming are <a href="https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">HLS.js</a> and <a href="https://github.com/shaka-project/shaka-player" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Skaka Player</a>. They both use <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/media-source/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Media Source Extension</a> to be able to handle this format. <em>I won’t go into more detail about players and MSE as it’s not the goal of this article; you can read more by clicking on the link I provided.</em></p><p id="476c">To prevent loading the video files from the cloud storage each time someone tries to play the video, and therefore pay a lot of money to the cloud provider, we use a <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Content Delivery Network (CDN)</a>.</p><figure><figcaption>Custom schema showing the process of using a CDN</figcaption></figure><p id="3bcd">The user lands on the site to stream the video. All calls to retrieve the video go through our CDN provider, Cloudflare. A CDN will cache the content at the edges, which means if the content you are requesting is not present in their cache, it will demand it to the URL you provided.</p><p id="7437">The “edge” part means that depending on where you are in the world, it will store it in a server close to you (regionally) so that if a user in your region asks for the same content, he gets it blazingly fast. If a user from another side of the world asks for the same content, it will do the same process and store it close to that user.</p><p id="6d56">Each video chunk is a separate file, so the waiting time for the unlucky user who has to create the cache is still relatively low. Not thousands of megabytes to download at once.</p></div><div><p id="beb3">I skipped some essential parts of our architecture like micro-services, WebSockets, Redis pub/sub, or webhooks to keep the focus on Kubernetes’ auto-scaling capabilities in combination with RabbitMQ asynchronous queues. I’ll probably write another article about “communication” in our architecture soon.</p><p id="23bd">YouTube probably has an implementation that differs significantly from ours, but it’s already a good look into what a complex system with Kubernetes might look like.</p><p id="25aa">I would love to be a little mouse and peek at YouTube’s complete architecture to see how far we are from them. I might want to contact Ratatouille’s movie creator to do so; it’s a real story right?</p></div></div>]]></description>

Summer nuclear power plant northwest of Columbia.</p><!----><!--]--><!--[--><p>This past week, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued what’s known as a preliminary “yellow’’ safety assessment, a measure of how serious an atomic safety problem is considered at a power plant. Yellow assessments are the second most serious on an NRC scale of severity.</p><!----><!--]--><!--[--><p>The NRC, which rarely issues yellow findings, said nuclear plant operators <a href="https://www.thestate.com/news/local/environment/article279283589.html" target="_blank" rel="Follow">did not resolve cracking </a>problems from 2003 to 2022 in V.C. Summer’s diesel generator system, one of the most important backup safety systems at an atomic power plant.</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>NRC officials were not available Friday to explain their concerns with the backup diesel generator system, but an Oct. 4 enforcement letter to Dominion nuclear operations president Eric Carr said the utility violated an atomic safety standard that could result in more scrutiny of the power plant. </p><!----><!--]--><!--[--><p>“We are considering escalated enforcement for the apparent violation,’’ according to the letter signed by LaDonna Suggs, acting director of the NRC’s division of reactor projects.</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>That’s no surprise to one nuclear safety advocate. Yellow designations often spark additional investigation and scrutiny of atomic power plants like the one in Fairfield County, said David Lochbaum, a national expert on the inner workings of nuclear plants and NRC oversight.</p><!----><!--]--><!--[--><p>“The NRC feels this was avoidable,’’ Lochbaum said, when asked why the agency issued a yellow finding. “There were signs of problems that were overlooked. Because of that, the problem grew to a point where the diesel generator’’ system did not work during testing.</p><!----><!--]--><!--[--><p>“You’re supposed to find and fix problems that occur,’’ he said.</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>Since 2009, the NRC has issued seven yellow findings against the nation’s nuclear power plants, Lochbaum said, after reviewing agency records. Only a red designation is considered worse, with white and green findings less significant. The United States has nearly 100 nuclear plants.</p><!----><!--]--><!--[--><p>The NRC’s determination is not final and is listed as an “apparent’’ violation. Dominion will have an opportunity to explain more about the diesel generator system issues, according to the NRC. Dominion spokesman Darryl Huger said the company “has implemented a plan to improve the system’s reliability.’’</p><!----><!--]--><!--[--><p>Huger, in an email to The State, said V.C. Summer has a history of operating safely, maintaining what he said was an “exemplary’’ record. The recent NRC concern centers on a pipe that delivers fuel to one of the power plant’s two emergency diesel generators, he said. Dominion found problems after testing the piping system, according to the NRC. </p><!--]--><!--[--><p>The power company, which acquired former V.C. Summer plant owner SCE&amp;G after a failed effort to build two additional reactors at the site, plans to install thicker piping in the generator system, Huger said.</p><!----><!--]--><!--[--><figure>                      <div>            <picture>                <!--[if IE 9]><video style="display: none;"><![endif]-->                <source srcset="https://www.thestate.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/cindi-ross-scoppe/wb0uqx/picture215586825/alternates/FREE_1140/ReactorsFretwellPix5x2.8" media="(min-width: 992px)">                <source srcset="https://www.thestate.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/cindi-ross-scoppe/wb0uqx/picture215586825/alternates/FREE_960/ReactorsFretwellPix5x2.8" media="(min-width: 768px)">                <source srcset="https://www.thestate.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/cindi-ross-scoppe/wb0uqx/picture215586825/alternates/FREE_768/ReactorsFretwellPix5x2.8" media="(min-width: 601px)">                <source srcset="https://www.thestate.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/cindi-ross-scoppe/wb0uqx/picture215586825/alternates/FREE_640/ReactorsFretwellPix5x2.8" media="(min-width: 441px)">                <source srcset="https://www.thestate.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/cindi-ross-scoppe/wb0uqx/picture215586825/alternates/FREE_480/ReactorsFretwellPix5x2.8" media="(min-width: 320px)">                <!--[if IE 9]></video><![endif]-->                                <img srcset="https://www.thestate.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/cindi-ross-scoppe/wb0uqx/picture215586825/alternates/FREE_1140/ReactorsFretwellPix5x2.8" alt="V.C.

If power is lost, the nuclear fuel can melt, causing radiation to be released into the surrounding community.</p><!----><!--]--><!--[--><p>In this case, officials at the V.C. Summer plant learned about cracks in fuel pipes in the facility’s diesel generator system in 2003. Utility workers fixed the initial crack, as well as other cracks four different times in the years after the initial work was done. </p><!----><!--]--><!--[--><p>But the NRC says the utility never adequately assessed what could be done to make sure the diesel piping system did not experience more cracking. The most recent cracks were identified in November 2022 during a 24-hour test of the system. Workers found a small leak on one of two diesel generator systems. The leak increased over time and workers discovered a 140-degree crack around a pipe, records show.</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>The cracking occurred mostly in the power plant’s “A” diesel generator system, although one problem occurred in the plant’s “B” generator system. The plant has two backup diesel generators. </p><!----><!--]--><!--[--><p>The cracking that led to the yellow safety finding follows separate, electrical problems with the plant’s diesel generator system in 2022. The NRC said the company, in that case, also <a href="https://www.thestate.com/news/local/environment/article268772222.html" target="_blank" rel="Follow">failed to promptly resolve</a> problems, issuing a white finding last year. White is lower in safety significant than yellow, but still considered notable.</p><!----><!--]--><!--[--><p>Tom Clements, a long-time nuclear safety advocate, said the NRC’s recent yellow safety assessment reveals a violation “too egregious to ignore.’’ He called for a “severe monetary fine’’ against Dominion, which he said ignored preventative maintenance through the years.</p><!--]--><!--[--><p>Dominion’s problems are noteworthy in light of the company’s recent request to renew its V.C. Summer operating license another 40 years, Clements said. The power plant, which cranked up operations in the early 1980s, is about 25 miles northwest of Columbia in rural Fairfield County.</p><!----><!--]--><!--[--><p>“Hopefully, serious safety problems don’t lurk in other reactor safety systems at the reactor,’’ Clements said in an email to The State. “This incident serves as a wake-up call to fully analyze all such systems prior to a license-renewal determination.’’</p><!----><!--]--><!--[--><figure>                      <div>            <picture>                <!--[if IE 9]><video style="display: none;"><![endif]-->                <source srcset="https://www.thestate.com/latest-news/7jilfu/picture279284539/alternates/FREE_1140/photo-plant-nuclear,%20from%20SCEG.jpg" media="(min-width: 992px)">                <source srcset="https://www.thestate.com/latest-news/7jilfu/picture279284539/alternates/FREE_960/photo-plant-nuclear,%20from%20SCEG.jpg" media="(min-width: 768px)">                <source srcset="https://www.thestate.com/latest-news/7jilfu/picture279284539/alternates/FREE_768/photo-plant-nuclear,%20from%20SCEG.jpg" media="(min-width: 601px)">                <source srcset="https://www.thestate.com/latest-news/7jilfu/picture279284539/alternates/FREE_640/photo-plant-nuclear,%20from%20SCEG.jpg" media="(min-width: 441px)">                <source srcset="https://www.thestate.com/latest-news/7jilfu/picture279284539/alternates/FREE_480/photo-plant-nuclear,%20from%20SCEG.jpg" media="(min-width: 320px)">                <!--[if IE 9]></video><![endif]-->                                <img srcset="https://www.thestate.com/latest-news/7jilfu/picture279284539/alternates/FREE_1140/photo-plant-nuclear,%20from%20SCEG.jpg" alt="The V.C.

        <h2>What's going on?</h2>
        <p>Linux is borrowing unused memory for disk caching. This makes it look like you are low on memory, but you are not! Everything is fine!</p>

        <h2>Why is it doing this?</h2>
        <p>Disk caching makes the system much faster and more responsive! There are no downsides, except for confusing newbies. It does not take memory away from applications in any way, ever!</p>

        <h2>What if I want to run more applications?</h2>
        <p>If your applications want more memory, they just take back a chunk that the disk cache borrowed. Disk cache can always be given back to applications immediately! You are not low on ram!</p>

        <h2>Do I need more swap?</h2>
        <p>No, disk caching only borrows the ram that applications don't currently want. It will not use swap. If applications want more memory, they just take it back from the disk cache. They will not start swapping.</p>

        <h2>How do I stop Linux from doing this?</h2>
        <p>You can't disable disk caching. The only reason anyone ever wants to disable disk caching is because they think it takes memory away from their applications, which it doesn't! Disk cache makes applications load faster and run smoother, but it NEVER EVER takes memory away from them! Therefore, there's absolutely no reason to disable it!</p>
        <p>If, however, you find yourself needing to clear some RAM quickly to workaround another issue, like a VM misbehaving, you can force linux to nondestructively <a href="https://linux-mm.org/Drop_Caches">drop caches</a> using <code>echo 3 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches</code>.</p>

        <h2>Why does top and free say all my ram is used if it isn't?</h2>
        <p>This is just a difference in terminology. Both you and Linux agree that memory taken by applications is "used", while memory that isn't used for anything is "free".</p>
        <p>But how do you count memory that is currently used for something, but can still be made available to applications?</p>
        <p>You might count that memory as "free" and/or "available". Linux instead counts it as "used", but also "available":</p>
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Memory that is</th>
              <th>You'd call it</th>
              <th>Linux calls it</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>used by applications</td>
              <td>Used</td>
              <td>Used</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>used, but can be made available</td>
              <td>Free (or Available)</td>
              <td>Used (and Available)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>not used for anything</td>
              <td>Free</td>
              <td>Free</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>This "something" is (roughly) what top and free calls "buffers" and "cached". Since your and Linux's terminology differs, you might think you are low on ram when you're not.</p>

        <h2>How do I see how much free ram I really have?</h2>
        <p>To see how much ram your applications could use without swapping, run <code>free -m</code> and look at the "available" column:</p>
        <pre>  $ free -m
                total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
  Mem:           1504        1491          13           0         855      <span><strong>792</strong></span>
  Swap:          2047           6        2041
</pre>
        <p><small>(On installations from before 2016, look at "free" column in the "-/+ buffers/cache" row instead.)</small></p>
        <p>This is your answer in MiB. If you just naively look at "used" and "free", you'll think your ram is 99% full when it's really just 47%!</p>
        <p>For a more detailed and technical description of what Linux counts as "available", see <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=34e431b0ae398fc54ea69ff85ec700722c9da773">the commit that added the field</a>.</p>

        <h2>When should I start to worry?</h2>
        <p>A <strong>healthy Linux system</strong> with more than enough memory will, after running for a while, show the following expected and harmless behavior:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>free</code> memory is close to <code>0</code> </li>
          <li><code>used</code> memory is close to <code>total</code> </li>
          <li><code>available</code> memory (or "free + buffers/cache") has enough room (let's say, 20%+ of total)</li>
          <li><code>swap used</code> does not change</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Warning signs</strong> of a genuine low memory situation that you may want to look into:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>available</code> memory (or "free + buffers/cache") is close to zero</li>
          <li><code>swap used</code> increases or fluctuates</li>
          <li><code>dmesg | grep oom-killer</code> shows the OutOfMemory-killer at work</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How can I verify these things?</h2>
        <p>See <a href="https://www.linuxatemyram.com/play.html">this page</a> for more details and how you can experiment with disk cache to show the effects described here. Few things make you appreciate disk caching more than measuring an order-of-magnitude speedup on your own hardware!</p>

<p>This story has been making the rounds on the internet with a claim that you’ve probably been told during visits to castles, but, it’s not true.</p>

<p>In short the idea is that it’s easier for a soldier or right-handed knight to fight in a spiral staircase that is built clockwise when they were defending the castle as they had space to swing their weapon while the attacker would find this more difficult.</p>



<p>Like many myths that stick, the story at first makes sense.<br>So when we hear it from a guide during a castle tour, from our history teacher, or even on television documentaries, why would we doubt it?</p>



<p>But if you think about it a bit longer and start looking for evidence, you soon realise something is a bit iffy here.<br>For starters, there is no primary evidence, whatsoever, that the people who built, lived and fought in these castles built staircases in that way for that reason. During the Middle Ages, nobody wrote down that you should build staircases like this and why.<br>If it had been common knowledge among castle builders, then why are there still quite a lot (about 30%) of castles with counter-clockwise staircases?<br>And no, before you start, there’s no evidence of the Kerrs being left handed, that’s probably an 19th century (yes, them again) <a href="https://triskeleheritage.triskelepublishing.com/2023/08/15/mediaeval-mythbusting-blog-24-the-left-handed-kerrs/">myth</a>.<br>The Tower of London, one of the most important castles in England, where royalty live(d) has counter-clockwise stairs!<br>If medieval people thought this would give the defenders not an advantage, surely they would have fixed it, especially in this castle!</p>

<p>Another reason why we know this story is a myth is that it also doesn’t make a lot of sense when you study medieval combat involving castles.<br>Castle builders knew that it didn’t really make a huge difference which way the stairs go, they’re not suitable for fighting at all, neither party has a lot of space to wield those long,<br>pointy, sharp weapons.<br>The person below you has the advantage of jabbing at your legs and feet while they can protect their head with their helmet and shield.<br>Of course the only way to win would be by pushing your enemy back down the stairs and then with whoever is left above you, retake the entire castle.<br>Yeah, that’s unlikely to work out.<br>Frankly, if you find yourself in this position the castle is probably already lost.<br>A better way to stop your enemy might be to block the stairs by throwing heavy furniture and everything else you can find down it while you then wait at the top of the stairs where you have more space to fight and where your enemy really is at a disadvantage as they’re still on the stairs below you.</p>



<p>For attackers it’s also not a very tempting scenario.<br>If you’ve already breached all the outer walls and defeated all the soldiers there, who would want to risk their life crawling up some stairs where the defenders are waiting for you?<br>Sieges often didn’t involve much fighting at all, as simply waiting outside the castle till the people inside ran out of water and food was a much easier and less bloody way to win.<br>In many cases simply realising the enemy was going to sit outside and wait was enough to surrender.</p>





<p>So in conclusion: there’s no evidence for this claim and it also doesn’t make a lot of sense.<br>This, like SO MANY myths about the middle ages can very likely be <a href="https://archive.org/details/spiralsinnaturea00cook/page/144/mode/2up">credited to the Victorians</a>.<br>For more research &amp; the opinions of historians, archaeologists &amp; other experts check the sources below.</p>



<p>Stairs were used to go up and down floors, they were not dimly lit or built to be uneven on purpose as you wouldn’t want servants, soldiers but also the lords and ladies themselves falling down them all the time.<br>“Oh no Lord Dave has fallen down the stairs and broken his neck because we have no lights and dodgy steps in the tower just in case there’s a siege even though we haven’t had one in generations….”</p>



<p>And if you’re trained in medieval combat and have access to some castle stairs, please do some experimenting, try if you can fight there and make a video of it, I’ll share it here!<br>Do be careful &amp; responsible though, I won’t take responsibility for you damaging yourself or worse, the castle 😉</p>
