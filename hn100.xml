<h3>from the <i>we-stand-by-our-reporting</i> dept</h3>

<p>Back in December, we wrote about Appin. We were not writing about the reports (<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-crime/a-confession-exposes-indias-secret-hacking-industry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">of which there have been many</a>) that the organization that started as a sort of cybersecurity training school, but morphed into a kind of “hack-for-hire” scheme was involved in all sorts of nefarious activity. Rather we wrote about their (ab)use of the Indian court system <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/12/07/indian-court-orders-reuters-to-take-down-investigative-report-regarding-a-hack-for-hire-company/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to order Reuters to remove a big, detailed, investigative report</a> on the company.</p>
<p>The history of Appin, and reporting on its involvement in hacking schemes, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/delhi-firm-with-mod-as-client-is-linked-to-pak-cyberattacks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">goes back a over a decade</a>. Reports of Appin trying to hide and suppress such stories is a bit shorter but are abundant. And Appin has, at times, been quite successful, especially in trying to remove the name of the guy regularly accused of being behind Appin, Rajat Khare. See this <a href="https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/business/-project-merciless---how-qatar-spied-on-the-world-of-football-in-switzerland/48022952" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SwissInfo report on how Qatar “spied on the world of football,”</a> which was forced to remove Khare’s name while leaving in Appin’s.</p>

</div>
<p>Or how about the Bureau of Investigative Journalism story published in 2022, <a href="https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2022-11-05/inside-the-global-hack-for-hire-industry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inside the Global Hack-for-Hire Industry</a>. An <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221105180814/https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2022-11-05/inside-the-global-hack-for-hire-industry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earlier version</a> of that report names Khare. In April of 2023, the article was updated, and all mentions of Khare disappeared. There are many more examples as well.</p>
<p>Back in December, the Daily Beast finally had an article entitled “<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/who-is-killing-all-these-stories-about-rajat-khare-controversial-tech-mogul">Who is Killing all These Stories About a Controversial Tech Mogul?</a>” highlighting how stories about Khare and Appin have a noticeable history of suddenly disappearing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In a move that has press freedom campaigners troubled, </em><strong><em>Rajat Khare</em></strong><em>, co-founder of Appin, an India-based tech company, has used a variety of law firms in a number of different jurisdictions to threaten these U.S., British, Swiss, Indian, and French-language media organizations.</em></p>
<p><em>On Nov. 16, Reuters </em><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231117025741/https:/www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-hackers-appin/"><em><u>published a special investigation</u></em></a><em> under the headline “How an Indian startup hacked the world,” detailing how Appin allegedly became a “hack for hire powerhouse that stole secrets from executives, politicians, military officials and wealthy elites around the globe”—a claim that Khare strongly denies. Khare retained the powerhouse “</em><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/metoo-media-assassins-clare-locke-still-repping-russian-oligarchs"><em><u>media assassin</u></em></a><em>” firm Clare Locke LLP, </em><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/60-minutes-boss-hired-law-firm-over-metoo-story"><em><u>which boasts on its website</u></em></a><em> about “killing stories,” to send Reuters several legal threats over the past year about the story, according to two people familiar with the matter.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the removal of the Reuters story, which at least involved an actual court order, others appeared to be bullied into submission as well. Perhaps most shockingly, Lawfare (who, of anyone, should understand how ridiculous this is) <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/the-hack-for-hire-industry-death-by-a-thousand-cuts-when-theft-doesn't-work-troll" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">redacted their version of the story</a> about Reuters pulling down its article, saying that they did so after receiving “a letter notifying us that the Reuters story summarized in this article had been taken down pursuant to court order in response to allegations that it is false and defamatory. The letter demanded that we retract this post as well.” And they did so, despite no legal basis:</p>
<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/lex-img-p.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/img/82d57951-02e4-40ac-978b-b3482120cdad-RackMultipart20240131-115-nb6a8i.png?ssl=1" alt="Image" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>
</div>
<p>Unsurprisingly, we also received similar demands. We received multiple emails claiming to represent “Association of Appin Training Centers” legal department, and claiming (falsely) that by quoting the Reuters article (which we did not even do) we were also liable for violating the court order. Similar demands were also sent to our CDN provider, our domain registrar, and the domain registry.</p>
<p>The only thing we quoted from Reuters was their announcement about the removal — not from the original article. The other parts we quoted were from SentinelOne, the security research firm that Reuters used to analyze the data. At the time we wrote the article, SentinelOne’s report remained online (it, too, has since been removed “in light of a pending court order … out of an abundance of caution”).</p>
<p>In the meantime, though, all these attempts to pull down and hide the content appears to be causing a bit of a Streisand Effect. Beyond the Daily Beast article calling out the campaign, the website Distributed Denial of Secrets decided to <a href="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Appin_Uncensored" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">republish the Reuters piece</a> as part of its new “Greenhouse” project, noting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In response to the unacceptable censorship by Appin and the Indian courts, Distributed Denial of Secrets is launching a new initiative to combat censorship: the Greenhouse Project. The Greenhouse Project continues DDoSecrets’ mission of ensuring the free transmission of data in the public interest by making the ‘publisher of last resort’ concept <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1255175.1255274" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>proposed by George Buchanan in 2007</u></a> a reality. By ensuring the reporting and source files are preserved, the Greenhouse Project <a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/04/11/los-angeles-lawsuit-lapd-headshots/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>builds on previous efforts</u></a> creating a “warming effect” to reverse the chilling effects of censorship.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition, the <a href="https://freedom.press/news/global-censorship-campaign-raises-alarms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Freedom of the Press Foundation</a>, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/01/19/india-judge-reuters-story-00136339" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Politico</a>, and<a href="https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/qa_emma_best_ddosecrets.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Columbia Journalism Review</a> have all run stories on Appin’s attempt to silence reporters. And, of course, all of this just keeps bringing more and more attention to the underlying claims about Khare and Appin. If Khare disputes those claims he could respond to them and refute them directly. Instead, he appears to be continuing a campaign of legal threats and dubious legal filings to seek to scare off reporters.</p>
<p>A few weeks back, we found out that our friends at Muckrock, the operators of DocumentCloud, had also received similar threats regarding documents hosted on that site.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, EFF sent a letter to the Association of Appin Training Centers, on behalf of both us and Muckrock, pointing out that the arguments they made in their letters to both of us did not appear to match what was <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24399471/co.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in the actual court filing</a>, which (1) does not clearly establish that the articles were defamatory based on the full evidence and a complete defense by Reuters, and (2) very clearly only apply to Reuters and Google. Furthermore, the letter points out that we are protected by the First Amendment, and any move to enforce a foreign order that violates the First Amendment would be barred under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/part-VI/chapter-181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the SPEECH Act</a>.</p>
<p>You can find <a href="https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2024/feb/01/global-censorship-appin-reuters/">Muckrock’s article about this here</a>. Andy Greenberg, at Wired, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/appin-training-centers-lawsuits-censorship/">also has a story about this</a>.</p>
<p>This kind of censorial bullying may work on other publications, but Techdirt believes that (1) important stories, especially around surveillance and hacking, deserve to be read and (2) it’s vitally important to <strong>call it out publicly</strong> when operations like Appin seek to silence reporting, especially when it’s done through abusing the legal process to silence and intimidate journalists and news organizations.</p>
<p>We want to thank David Greene and Aaron Mackey at EFF for their help with this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>To the Association of Appin Training Centers:</em></p>
<p><em>We represent and write on behalf of Techdirt and MuckRock Foundation (which runs the DocumentCloud hosting services), each of which received correspondence from you making certain assertions about the legal significance of an interim court order in the matter of Vinay Pandey v. Raphael Satter &amp; Ors. Please direct any future correspondence about this matter to us.</em></p>
<p><em>We are concerned with two issues you raise in your correspondence.</em></p>
<p><em>First, you refer to the Reuters article as containing defamatory materials as determined by the court. However, the court’s order by its very terms is an interim order, that the defendants’ evidence has not yet been considered, and that a final determination of the defamatory character of the article has not been made. The order itself states ‘this is only a prima-facie opinion and the defendants shall have sufficient opportunity to express their views through reply, contest in the main suit etc. and the final decision shall be taken subsequently.</em></p>
<p><em>Second, you assert that reporting by others of the disputed statements made in the Reuters article ‘which itself is a violation of an Indian Court Order, thereby making you also liable under Contempt of Courts Act, 1971.’ But, again by its plain terms, the court’s interim order applies only to Reuters and to Google. The order does not require any other person or entity to depublish their articles or other pertinent materials. And the order does not address its effect on those outside the jurisdiction of Indian courts. The order is in no way the global takedown order your correspondence represents it to be. Moreover, both Techdirt and MuckRock Foundation are U.S. entities. Thus, even if the court’s order could apply beyond the parties named within it, it will be unenforceable in U.S. courts to the extent it and Indian defamation law is inconsistent with the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and 47 U.S.C. § 230, pursuant to the SPEECH Act, 28 U.S.C. § 4102. Since the First Amendment would not permit an interim depublication order in a defamation case, the Pandey order is unenforceable.</em></p>
<p><em>If you disagree, please provide us with legal authority so we can assess those arguments. Unless we hear from you otherwise, we will assume that you concede that the order binds only Reuters and Google and that you will cease asserting otherwise to our clients or to anyone else.</em><br><em>———————————————————–</em><br><em>David Greene<br>Civil Liberties Director/Senior Staff Attorney<br>Electronic Frontier Foundation</em></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post"><article><p>02/01/2024</p><section><p>11 min read</p><div><p>On Thanksgiving Day, November 23, 2023, Cloudflare detected a threat actor on our self-hosted Atlassian server. Our security team immediately began an investigation, cut off the threat actor’s access, and on Sunday, November 26, we brought in CrowdStrike’s Forensic team to perform their own independent analysis.</p><p>Yesterday, CrowdStrike completed its investigation, and we are publishing this blog post to talk about the details of this security incident.</p><p>We want to emphasize to our customers that no Cloudflare customer data or systems were impacted by this event. Because of our access controls, firewall rules, and use of hard security keys enforced using our own Zero Trust tools, the threat actor’s ability to move laterally was limited. No services were implicated, and no changes were made to our global network systems or configuration. This is the promise of a Zero Trust architecture: it’s like bulkheads in a ship where a compromise in one system is limited from compromising the whole organization.</p><p>From November 14 to 17, a threat actor did reconnaissance and then accessed our internal wiki (which uses Atlassian Confluence) and our bug database (Atlassian Jira). On November 20 and 21, we saw additional access indicating they may have come back to test access to ensure they had connectivity.</p><p>They then returned on November 22 and established persistent access to our Atlassian server using ScriptRunner for Jira, gained access to our source code management system (which uses Atlassian Bitbucket), and tried, unsuccessfully, to access a console server that had access to the data center that Cloudflare had not yet put into production in São Paulo, Brazil.</p><p>They did this by using one access token and three service account credentials that had been taken, and that we failed to rotate, after the <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-cloudflare-mitigated-yet-another-okta-compromise">Okta compromise of October 2023</a>. All threat actor access and connections were terminated on November 24 and CrowdStrike has confirmed that the last evidence of threat activity was on November 24 at 10:44.</p><p><em>(Throughout this blog post all dates and times are UTC.)</em></p><p>Even though we understand the operational impact of the incident to be extremely limited, we took this incident very seriously because a threat actor had used stolen credentials to get access to our Atlassian server and accessed some documentation and a limited amount of source code. Based on our collaboration with colleagues in the industry and government, we believe that this attack was performed by a nation state attacker with the goal of obtaining persistent and widespread access to Cloudflare’s global network.</p><h3 id="%E2%80%9Ccode-red%E2%80%9D-remediation-and-hardening-effort">“Code Red” Remediation and Hardening Effort</h3><p>On November 24, after the threat actor was removed from our environment, our security team pulled in all the people they needed across the company to investigate the intrusion and ensure that the threat actor had been completely denied access to our systems, and to ensure we understood the full extent of what they accessed or tried to access.</p><p>Then, from November 27, we redirected the efforts of a large part of the Cloudflare technical staff (inside and outside the security team) to work on a single project dubbed “Code Red”. The focus was strengthening, validating, and remediating any control in our environment to ensure we are secure against future intrusion and to validate that the threat actor could not gain access to our environment. Additionally, we continued to investigate every system, account and log to make sure the threat actor did not have persistent access and that we fully understood what systems they had touched and which they had attempted to access.</p><p>CrowdStrike performed an independent assessment of the scope and extent of the threat actor’s activity, including a search for any evidence that they still persisted in our systems. CrowdStrike’s investigation provided helpful corroboration and support for our investigation, but did not bring to light any activities that we had missed. This blog post outlines in detail everything we and CrowdStrike uncovered about the activity of the threat actor.</p><p>The only production systems the threat actor could access using the stolen credentials was our Atlassian environment. Analyzing the wiki pages they accessed, bug database issues, and source code repositories, it appears they were looking for information about the architecture, security, and management of our global network; no doubt with an eye on gaining a deeper foothold. Because of that, we decided a huge effort was needed to further harden our security protocols to prevent the threat actor from being able to get that foothold had we overlooked something from our log files.</p><p>Our aim was to prevent the attacker from using the technical information about the operations of our network as a way to get back in. Even though we believed, and later confirmed, the attacker had limited access, we undertook a comprehensive effort to rotate every production credential (more than 5,000 individual credentials), physically segment test and staging systems, performed forensic triages on 4,893 systems, reimaged and rebooted every machine in our global network including all the systems the threat actor accessed and all Atlassian products (Jira, Confluence, and Bitbucket).</p><p>The threat actor also attempted to access a console server in our new, and not yet in production, data center in São Paulo. All attempts to gain access were unsuccessful. To ensure these systems are 100% secure, equipment in the Brazil data center was returned to the manufacturers. The manufacturers’ forensic teams examined all of our systems to ensure that no access or persistence was gained. Nothing was found, but we replaced the hardware anyway.</p><p>We also looked for software packages that hadn’t been updated, user accounts that might have been created, and unused active employee accounts; we went searching for secrets that might have been left in Jira tickets or source code, examined and deleted all HAR files uploaded to the wiki in case they contained tokens of any sort. Whenever in doubt, we assumed the worst and made changes to ensure anything the threat actor was able to access would no longer be in use and therefore no longer be valuable to them.</p><p>Every member of the team was encouraged to point out areas the threat actor might have touched, so we could examine log files and determine the extent of the threat actor’s access. By including such a large number of people across the company, we aimed to leave no stone unturned looking for evidence of access or changes that needed to be made to improve security.</p><p>The immediate “Code Red” effort ended on January 5, but work continues across the company around credential management, software hardening, vulnerability management, additional alerting, and more.</p><h3 id="attack-timeline">Attack timeline</h3><p>The attack started in October with the compromise of Okta, but the threat actor only began targeting our systems using those credentials from the Okta compromise in mid-November.</p><p>The following timeline shows the major events:</p><h3 id="october-18okta-compromise">October 18 - Okta compromise</h3><p>We’ve <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-cloudflare-mitigated-yet-another-okta-compromise">written about this before</a> but, in summary, we were (for the second time) the victim of a compromise of Okta’s systems which resulted in a threat actor gaining access to a set of credentials. These credentials were meant to all be rotated.</p><p>Unfortunately, we failed to rotate one service token and three service accounts (out of thousands) of credentials that were leaked during the Okta compromise.</p><p>One was a Moveworks service token that granted remote access into our Atlassian system. The second credential was a service account used by the SaaS-based Smartsheet application that had administrative access to our Atlassian Jira instance, the third account was a Bitbucket service account which was used to access our source code management system, and the fourth was an AWS environment that had no access to the global network and no customer or sensitive data.</p><p>The one service token and three accounts were not rotated because mistakenly it was believed they were unused. This was incorrect and was how the threat actor first got into our systems and gained persistence to our Atlassian products. Note that this was in no way an error on the part of AWS, Moveworks or Smartsheet. These were merely credentials which we failed to rotate.</p><h3 id="november-14-092249threat-actor-starts-probing">November 14 09:22:49 - threat actor starts probing</h3><p>Our logs show that the threat actor started probing and performing reconnaissance of our systems beginning on November 14, looking for a way to use the credentials and what systems were accessible. They attempted to log into our Okta instance and were denied access. They attempted access to the Cloudflare Dashboard and were denied access.</p><p>Additionally, the threat actor accessed an AWS environment that is used to power the Cloudflare Apps marketplace. This environment was segmented with no access to global network or customer data. The service account to access this environment was revoked, and we validated the integrity of the environment.</p><h3 id="november-15-162838threat-actor-gains-access-to-atlassian-services">November 15 16:28:38 - threat actor gains access to Atlassian services</h3><p>The threat actor successfully accessed Atlassian Jira and Confluence on November 15 using the Moveworks service token to authenticate through our gateway, and then they used the Smartsheet service account to gain access to the Atlassian suite. The next day they began looking for information about the configuration and management of our global network, and accessed various Jira tickets.</p><p>The threat actor searched the wiki for things like remote access, secret, client-secret, openconnect, cloudflared, and token. They accessed 36 Jira tickets (out of a total of 2,059,357 tickets) and 202 wiki pages (out of a total of 194,100 pages).</p><p>The threat actor accessed Jira tickets about vulnerability management, secret rotation, MFA bypass, network access, and even our response to the Okta incident itself.</p><p>The wiki searches and pages accessed suggest the threat actor was very interested in all aspects of access to our systems: password resets, remote access, configuration, our use of Salt, but they did not target customer data or customer configurations.</p><h3 id="november-16-143637threat-actor-creates-an-atlassian-user-account">November 16 14:36:37 - threat actor creates an Atlassian user account</h3><p>The threat actor used the Smartsheet credential to create an Atlassian account that looked like a normal Cloudflare user. They added this user to a number of groups within Atlassian so that they’d have persistent access to the Atlassian environment should the Smartsheet service account be removed.</p><h3 id="november-17-143352-to-november-20-092653threat-actor-takes-a-break-from-accessing-cloudflare-systems">November 17 14:33:52 to November 20 09:26:53 - threat actor takes a break from accessing Cloudflare systems</h3><p>During this period, the attacker took a break from accessing our systems (apart from apparently briefly testing that they still had access) and returned just before Thanksgiving.</p><h3 id="november-22-141822threat-actor-gains-persistence">November 22 14:18:22 - threat actor gains persistence</h3><p>Since the Smartsheet service account had administrative access to Atlassian Jira, the threat actor was able to install the Sliver Adversary Emulation Framework, which is a widely used tool and framework that red teams and attackers use to enable “C2” (command and control), connectivity gaining persistent and stealthy access to a computer on which it is installed. Sliver was installed using the ScriptRunner for Jira plugin.</p><p>This allowed them continuous access to the Atlassian server, and they used this to attempt lateral movement. With this access the Threat Actor attempted to gain access to a non-production console server in our São Paulo, Brazil data center due to a non-enforced ACL. The access was denied, and they were not able to access any of the global network.</p><p>Over the next day, the threat actor viewed 120 code repositories (out of a total of 11,904 repositories). Of the 120, the threat actor used the Atlassian Bitbucket git archive feature on 76 repositories to download them to the Atlassian server, and even though we were not able to confirm whether or not they had been exfiltrated, we decided to treat them as having been exfiltrated.</p><p>The 76 source code repositories were almost all related to how backups work, how the global network is configured and managed, how identity works at Cloudflare, remote access, and our use of Terraform and Kubernetes. A small number of the repositories contained encrypted secrets which were rotated immediately even though they were strongly encrypted themselves.</p><p>We focused particularly on these 76 source code repositories to look for embedded secrets, (secrets stored in the code were rotated), vulnerabilities and ways in which an attacker could use them to mount a subsequent attack. This work was done as a priority by engineering teams across the company as part of “Code Red”.</p><p>As a SaaS company, we’ve long believed that our source code itself is not as precious as the source code of software companies that distribute software to end users. In fact, we’ve open sourced a large amount of our source code and speak openly through our blog about algorithms and techniques we use. So our focus was not on someone having access to the source code, but whether that source code contained embedded secrets (such as a key or token) and vulnerabilities.</p><h3 id="november-23discovery-and-threat-actor-access-termination-begins">November 23 - Discovery and threat actor access termination begins</h3><p>Our security team was alerted to the threat actor’s presence at 16:00 and deactivated the Smartsheet service account 35 minutes later. 48 minutes later the user account created by the threat actor was found and deactivated. Here’s the detailed timeline for the major actions taken to block the threat actor once the first alert was raised.</p><p>15:58 - The threat actor adds the Smartsheet service account to an administrator group.<br>16:00 - Automated alert about the change at 15:58 to our security team.<br>16:12 - Cloudflare SOC starts investigating the alert.<br>16:35 - Smartsheet service account deactivated by Cloudflare SOC.<br>17:23 - The threat actor-created Atlassian user account is found and deactivated.<br>17:43 - Internal Cloudflare incident declared.<br>21:31 - Firewall rules put in place to block the threat actor’s known IP addresses.</p><h3 id="november-24sliver-removed-all-threat-actor-access-terminated">November 24 - Sliver removed; all threat actor access terminated</h3><p>10:44 - Last known threat actor activity.<br>11:59 - Sliver removed.</p><p>Throughout this timeline, the threat actor tried to access a myriad of other systems at Cloudflare but failed because of our access controls, firewall rules, and use of hard security keys enforced using our own Zero Trust tools.</p><p>To be clear, we saw no evidence whatsoever that the threat actor got access to our global network, data centers, SSL keys, customer databases or configuration information, Cloudflare Workers deployed by us or customers, AI models, network infrastructure, or any of our datastores like Workers KV, R2 or Quicksilver. Their access was limited to the Atlassian suite and the server on which our Atlassian runs.</p><p>A large part of our “Code Red” effort was understanding what the threat actor got access to and what they tried to access. By looking at logging across systems we were able to track attempted access to our internal metrics, network configuration, build system, alerting systems, and release management system. Based on our review, none of their attempts to access these systems were successful. Independently, CrowdStrike performed an assessment of the scope and extent of the threat actor’s activity, which did not bring to light activities that we had missed and concluded that the last evidence of threat activity was on November 24 at 10:44.</p><p>We are confident that between our investigation and CrowdStrike’s, we fully understand the threat actor’s actions and that they were limited to the systems on which we saw their activity.</p><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>This was a security incident involving a sophisticated actor, likely a nation-state, who operated in a thoughtful and methodical manner. The efforts we have taken to ensure that the ongoing impact of the incident was limited and that we are well-prepared to fend off any sophisticated attacks in the future. This required the efforts of a significant number of Cloudflare’s engineering staff, and, for over a month, this was the highest priority at Cloudflare. The entire Cloudflare team worked to ensure that our systems were secure, the threat actor’s access was understood, to remediate immediate priorities (such as mass credential rotation), and to build a plan of long-running work to improve our overall security based on areas for improvement discovered during this process.</p><p>I am incredibly grateful to everyone at Cloudflare who responded quickly over the Thanksgiving holiday to conduct an initial analysis and lock out of the threat actor and all those who contributed to this effort. It would be impossible to name everyone involved, but their long hours and dedicated work made it possible to undertake an essential review and change of Cloudflare’s security while keeping our global network running and our customers’ service running.</p><p>We are grateful to CrowdStrike for having been available immediately to conduct an independent assessment. Now that their final report is complete, we are confident in our internal analysis and remediation of the intrusion and are making this blog post available.</p><p><strong>IOCs</strong><br>Below are the Indications of Compromise (IOCs) that we saw from this threat actor. We are publishing them so that other organizations, and especially those that may have been impacted by the Okta breach, can search their logs to confirm the same threat actor did not access their systems.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-14955">
            
            

            <div>
                <menu><menuitem></menu>                
                <p>The web is amazing. It makes collaborating, learning, and connecting easy for billions of people, because it’s intentionally designed to run on radically different devices.</p>
<p>It’s your job as a web developer to ensure your project works in every browser and for every user — and that can be hard to do. It’s a far easier undertaking when browsers have identical implementations of the web technology you use.</p>
<p>Identical implementations are accomplished through the web standards process, where people collaborate together to write extremely detailed technical documents that define each new web technology — right down to how website bugs should work.</p>
<p>One way to check and see if browsers follow the web standards is through automated testing. There are several shared repositories of such tests, including <a href="https://web-platform-tests.org/">Web Platform Tests</a>. WPT contains over 1.8&nbsp;million tests, of which over 95% pass in all of the major browsers.</p>
<h2><a name="the-interop-project"></a>The Interop Project</h2>
<p>The Interop project aims to improve interoperability by encouraging browser engine teams to look deeper into specific focus areas. Now, for a third year, Apple, <a href="https://bocoup.com/blog/interop-2024">Bocoup</a>, <a href="https://web.dev/blog/interop-2024">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.igalia.com/2024/interop-2024-launches.html">Igalia</a>, <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2024/02/01/microsoft-edge-and-interop-2024/">Microsoft</a>, and <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2024/02/announcing-interop-2024/">Mozilla</a> pooled our collective expertise and selected a specific subset of automated tests for 2024.</p>
<p>Some of the technologies chosen have been around for a long time. Other areas are brand new. By selecting some of the highest priority features that developers have avoided for years because of their bugs, we can get them to a place where they can finally be relied on. And by selecting exciting new technology, we can ensure it’s interoperable from the beginning.</p>
<p>To better understand where interoperability is going in the future, let’s first take a look at the impact of Interop 2023.</p>
<h2><a name="interop-2023"></a>Interop 2023</h2>
<p><a href="https://webkit.org/blog/13706/interop-2023/">Interop 2023</a> was even more of an overwhelming success than <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/12288/working-together-on-interop-2022/">Interop 2022</a>. In January 2023, 48%&nbsp;of the chosen tests passed in all three of the major browser engines (in those shipped to users: Chrome and Firefox for desktop Linux, and Safari on macOS Monterey). A year later, that pass rate rose to 95% (in Chrome Dev and Firefox Nightly for desktop Linux, and Safari Technology Preview on macOS Ventura).</p>

<p>What did Interop 2023 accomplish?</p>
<ul>
<li>It ensured that all browsers have full support for P3 color, seven years after it started shipping. </li>
<li>Form controls now support vertical writing modes, for the first time in the web’s history. </li>
<li>CSS  <code>border-image</code> now works as originally intended. </li>
<li>Subgrid, Container Queries, <code>:has()</code>, Motion Path, CSS Math Functions, <code>inert</code> and <code>@property</code> are now supported in every modern browser. </li>
<li>Improved Web APIs include Offscreen Canvas, Modules in Web Workers, Import Maps, Import Assertions, and JavaScript Modules. </li>
<li>The entire Media Queries 4 specification is now supported everywhere, with easier to use syntax. </li>
<li>Web Components got a boost with <code>adoptedStyleSheets</code>, <code>ElementInternals</code>, Form-Associated Custom Elements, and the basic behavior of Shadow DOM and Custom Elements. </li>
<li>Useful CSS pseudo-classes can now be relied on, with consistent cross-browser support for <code>:nth-child()</code>, <code>:nth-last-child()</code>, <code>:modal</code>, <code>:user-valid</code>, and <code>:user-invalid</code>. </li>
<li>Feature queries now have new support for detecting font features. </li>
<li>Font Palettes provide robust support for color fonts. </li>
<li>Significant progress made improving CSS Masking, HTML Forms, Pointer and Mouse Events, Scrolling, Transforms, URL, WebCodecs, and a bucket of bugs causing web compat issues. </li>
<li><a href="https://webkit.org/blog/13706/interop-2023/#focus-areas">And more</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We hope this work gives you a renewed sense of confidence to use these technologies. If you found any of them hard-to-use in the past, give them another try.</p>
<p>Interop 2023 had twenty-six focus areas, twenty of which are being retired as a success. Work will continue on Custom Properties, Pointer and Mouse Events, URL, and a new grouping called “Layout” — consisting of Flexbox, Grid, and Subgrid.</p>
<h2><a name="interop-2024"></a>Interop 2024</h2>
<p>Now, we are doing it all again for 2024. Ninety-six focus area proposals were submitted for consideration. Ultimately, sixteen were chosen. Grouping some of the new proposals together, and continuing some of the work from 2023, gives Interop 2024 a total of seventeen focus areas.</p>

<p>Interop 2023 included an Accessibility Investigation project. Led by Apple’s accessibility team, the group worked diligently to create new accessibility testing infrastructure for WPT, and write over <a href="https://wpt.fyi/results/?label=master&amp;label=experimental&amp;aligned&amp;q=label%3Aaccessibility">1300 new accessibility tests</a>. These tests have now been included in Interop 2024 as a focus area, encouraging browsers to increase their support.</p>
<p>The majority of new accessibility tests cover <a href="https://w3c.github.io/aria/">WAI-ARIA</a>, in particular, <a href="https://w3c.github.io/aria/#roles">the Roles Model</a> and the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/accname/">Accessible Name and Description Computation</a> (AccName). Together, these provide a consistent mechanism for conveying the purpose or intent of an element so assistive technology users understand what it is and what they can do with it.</p>
<p>Other new accessibility tests cover how those technologies are incorporated into host languages. For example, the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/html-aam/">HTML Accessibility API Mappings specification (HTML-AAM)</a> defines the default accessibility semantics of HTML elements, along with related rules for how browsers work with features like the <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> element and image <code>alt</code> text. (See the <a href="https://wpt.fyi/results/html-aam/roles.html?label=master&amp;label=experimental&amp;aligned&amp;q=label%3Aaccessibility">html-aam/roles WPT tests</a> as an example.)</p>
<p>Another new set of tests cover the accessibility of <code>display: contents</code>. This display mode in CSS provides a useful mechanism for removing the box around content — helpful when wanting to adjust the parent/child/grandchild relationships of content for the purposes of Flexbox or Grid. But it was off limits for use for years, because of the <a href="https://caniuse.com/css-display-contents">lack of accessibility in early implementations</a>. Removing the box on an item completely removed all the contents of that box from the accessibility tree. Sighted users could still see the child content, but many users of assistive technology experienced it completely disappearing. Most of these problems have been fixed in browsers, but not all, not for every situation. These new tests are the next step toward full accessibility and interoperability.</p>
<p>By including these new Accessibility tests in Interop 2024, the hope is to fix every issue in all browsers. We want it to be easier for developers to create accessible sites and make the web better for everyone, including people with disabilities.</p>
<h3><a name="css-nesting"></a>CSS Nesting</h3>
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_nesting/Using_CSS_nesting">CSS Nesting</a> is a focus area for Interop 2024 to ensure any differences are ironed out, and to provide you with the confidence to use it. The ability to nest CSS <a href="https://caniuse.com/css-nesting">shipped in all four major browsers</a> in 2023 — first in Chrome, Edge, and Safari in April/May. And then in Firefox in August.</p>
<p>The web standard changed slightly between May and August, relaxing the original requirement that every nested selector start with a symbol. Developers can now simply write <code>article</code>, rather than needing to use  <code>&amp; article</code>.</p>
<p>All of the implementations have since been updated, but there are still small bits that could benefit from attention to interoperability, especially as the final complex details of how Nesting works are settled in the CSS Working Group. Most of Safari’s test failures, for example, are about how nested CSS <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/9509">interacts</a> with the Shadow DOM via <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:host"><code>:host</code></a>.</p>
<h3><a name="custom-properties"></a>Custom Properties</h3>
<p>The <code>@property</code> at-rule started <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_at-rules_property">shipping in browsers</a> over the last few years. As part of Interop 2023, the Custom Properties focus area rose from 4% of tests passing in all stable browsers to 7.6% passing — with 90.7% passing in all of the preview browsers. Firefox is the last browser to add support, which is currently in progress in Firefox Nightly. Since this work isn’t done yet, the focus area is being continued in 2024.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@property"><code>@property</code></a>, developers can declare CSS custom properties in a fashion similar to how browser engines define CSS properties — specifying its syntax, inheritance behavior, and initial value.</p>
<pre><code>@property --size {
  syntax: "&lt;length&gt;";
  inherits: false;
  initial-value: 0px;
}
</code></pre>
<p>This allows you to do things in CSS that were impossible before, like animating gradients or certain parts of transforms.</p>
<h3><a name="declarative-shadow-dom"></a>Declarative Shadow DOM</h3>
<p><a href="https://webkit.org/blog/13851/declarative-shadow-dom/">Declarative Shadow DOM</a> is a declarative API that lets you create reusable widgets and components by using only HTML — no JavaScript is necessary. It’s been <a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=Declarative%20Shadow%20DOM">supported</a> in Safari 16.4 since March 2023, and in Chrome 90 since April 2021. Firefox has an implementation in Firefox Nightly.</p>
<p>Declarative Shadow DOM was one of the often-asked-for features in the <a href="https://stateofhtml.com/en-US">State of HTML 2023</a> survey, so it was chosen to be part of Interop 2024 to ensure it becomes interoperable across all browsers.</p>
<h3><a name="font-size-adjust"></a>Font size adjust</h3>
<p>The <code>font-size-adjust</code> property is a great example of the usefulness of placing attention on older technology. Firefox first <a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=font-size-adjust">implemented</a> font size adjust in 2008, but it was rarely used or even discussed by web designers and developers. The early spec evolved over time, adding support for more languages through the two-value syntax, and becoming easier to use with the <code>from-font</code> value.</p>
<p>The WebKit team implemented the basic version in Safari 16.4 and added the updates in September’s Safari 17.0. Mozilla updated their implementation in Firefox 118, also in September 2023. Both Safari and Firefox now pass 100% of all tests. Chrome began an experimental implementation in 2015, but has yet to ship it. Now with Interop 2024, it’s likely every browser will gain complete support.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-size-adjust">Font size adjust</a> provides a simple way to conform all the fonts used in a string of text to be the same visual size — so every character in <code>1.4rem</code>-sized text, for example, has the same x-height — or cap height, <code>ch</code> width, <code>ic</code> width, or <code>ic</code> height. The two value syntax allows you to choose which measurement to conform.</p>
<p>This property is especially useful when you are mixing code with regular text, or mixing multiple languages together, and the different fonts within the same sentence have different sizes. With font size adjust you can avoid weirdly-big letters. No more fussing with font metrics to find a magic number that makes them all look the same size.</p>

<h3><a name="https-urls-for-websocket"></a>HTTPS URLs for WebSocket</h3>
<p>A quirky aspect of the WebSocket API is that you need to use non-HTTP(S) schemes: <code>ws:</code> (insecure) and <code>wss:</code>. As the URLs function otherwise identically to HTTP(S) URLs, this makes the API a bit frustrating to deal with. Based on web developer feedback the WebKit team decided to address this last year by making the API support HTTP(S) URLs as well. We shipped support in Safari 17.0.</p>
<p>This means that instead of writing:</p>
<pre><code>function webSocketHandle(path) {
  const url = new URL(path, location);
  url.protocol = location.protocol === "https:" ? "wss:" : "ws:";
  return new WebSocket(url);
}
// ...
const ws = webSocketHandle(path);
</code></pre>
<p>You can now write the much more ergonomic:</p>
<pre><code>const ws = new WebSocket(path);
</code></pre>
<p>By bringing this to Interop 2024, we hope other browsers will adopt it as well, making it universally available for web developers.</p>
<h3><a name="indexeddb"></a>IndexedDB</h3>
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API">IndexedDB</a> is an API that provides powerful ways to store data client-side, in an object-oriented database. It started shipping in browsers in 2011, and over the years the web standard has kept evolving. Both version 2 and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/">version 3</a> are supported by all major browsers. Version 2 is fully interoperable, but version 3 needs a bit of attention to bring up the quality of implementations. Being part of Interop 2024 will help ensure implementations are completed and aligned.</p>
<h3><a name="layout"></a>Layout</h3>
<p>CSS <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Grid_Layout">Grid</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout/Basic_concepts_of_flexbox">Flexbox</a> were both included in the original Interop project in 2021. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout/Subgrid">Subgrid</a> was added in Interop 2023. While all three layout methods are now in great shape, they still aren’t quite perfect. The tests for these three areas are now being combined into one Focus Area called Layout. Work will continue to ensure complex edge cases are more interoperable. Meanwhile, developers should absolutely feel confident using these three technologies, since all browsers have solid support for <a href="https://caniuse.com/flexbox">Flexbox</a>, <a href="https://caniuse.com/css-grid">Grid</a>, and now <a href="https://caniuse.com/css-subgrid">Subgrid</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="pointer-and-mouse-events"></a>Pointer and Mouse Events</h3>
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Pointer_events">Pointer events</a> are DOM events that are fired for a pointing device. They create a single DOM event model to handle pointing input devices such as a mouse, pen/stylus, or touch with one or more fingers. This API first started <a href="https://caniuse.com/pointer">shipping</a> in browsers in 2012, and landed everywhere by 2019, but still had rocky interoperability.</p>
<p>In 2022, the Interop team launched an Investigation Project to look deeper into the current state of Pointer and Mouse Events, in an effort to clarify consensus and write tests that captured the state of that consensus. For Interop 2023, those tests enabled Pointer and Mouse Events to be a Focus Area, where the test pass rate was part of the Interop 2023 dashboard and score. Over the year, Pointer and Mouse Events rose from a test pass rate of 34% to 81% — the most significant progress of any area.</p>
<p>While passing 81% of tests is a significant improvement, there is more work to do, therefore Pointer and Mouse Events will continue to be a Focus Area for 2024.</p>
<h3><a name="popover"></a>Popover</h3>
<p>The new <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/popover"><code>popover</code></a> attribute in HTML provides a built-into-the-browser way to have an element pop into view on the top layer of a page. If you are creating an overlay over the entire web page, the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog"><code>dialog</code></a> element is the best option. But when you want to turn any other element into a popup message, user interface, or other kind of content that appears and disappears, the <code>popover</code> element provides a framework to do it.</p>
<p>Support for <code>popover</code> shipped in Chrome 114 and Safari 17.0 in 2023. Firefox currently has support in progress in Firefox Nightly. Being part of Interop 2024 will ensure this highly desired feature has a fantastic start.</p>
<h3><a name="relative-color-syntax"></a>Relative Color Syntax</h3>
<p>Relative Color Syntax is a new way to define colors in CSS that allows you do so while referring to another color. You can, for instance, lighten or darken an existing color by a certain amount. You can take a color variable, adjust the saturation, and assign the new color to a second variable. Relative Color Syntax can be especially powerful when creating a design system.</p>
<figure>
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/relative-color-syntax-from-WWDC23.png" alt="a still from the WWDC session teach how relative color syntax works" width="2970" height="1672" srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/relative-color-syntax-from-WWDC23.png 2970w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/relative-color-syntax-from-WWDC23-300x169.png 300w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/relative-color-syntax-from-WWDC23-1024x576.png 1024w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/relative-color-syntax-from-WWDC23-768x432.png 768w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/relative-color-syntax-from-WWDC23-1536x865.png 1536w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/relative-color-syntax-from-WWDC23-2048x1153.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2970px) 100vw, 2970px"><figcaption>Learn more about Relative Color Syntax by watching <i><a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10121/?time=623">What’s new in CSS</a></i> from WWDC23. </figcaption></figure>
<p>Safari 16.4 was the first browser to ship support, in March 2023. Chrome 119 and Edge 119 shipped support in Oct and Nov 2023. Currently, none of the implementations have support for using <code>currentcolor</code> with Relative Color Syntax.</p>
<p>The Relative Color Syntax focus area for Interop 2024 doesn’t test overall support of Relative Color Syntax. It’s narrowly focused on whether or not <code>currentcolor</code> is supported, and includes tests of out-of-gamut behavior — checking to see what happens on displays that don’t have support for P3 color. Inclusion in Interop 2024 will help these final bits get done.</p>
<h3><a name="requestvideoframecallback"></a>requestVideoFrameCallback</h3>
<p>The <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element provides powerful functionality for putting video on the web. But often, developers want and need to do more. The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLVideoElement"><code>HTMLVideoElement</code></a> interface provides special properties and methods for manipulating video objects in JavaScript. And one of those methods is <code>requestVideoFrameCallback()</code>. It lets you perform per-video-frame operations on video in an efficient manner — operations like video processing or analysis, painting to canvas, and synchronization with audio sources.</p>
<p><a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-api_htmlvideoelement_requestvideoframecallback">Supported</a> since Chrome 83 and Safari 15.4, inclusion in Interop 2024 will help browsers complete and polish our implementations.</p>
<h3><a name="scrollbar-styling"></a>Scrollbar styling</h3>
<p>The scrollbar styling focus area includes two CSS properties that can be used to style scrollbars. The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scrollbar-width"><code>scrollbar-width</code></a> property provides three values: <code>auto</code>, <code>thin</code>, and <code>none</code>. The <code>auto</code> value is the default width; <code>thin</code> provides a thinner scrollbar; and <code>none</code> hides the scrollbar while still allowing content to scroll. Firefox 64 <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_scrollbar-width">implemented</a> support in December 2018, and it just shipped in Chrome 121 and Edge 121.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scrollbar-gutter"><code>scrollbar-gutter</code></a> property lets you reserve space for the scrollbar, so the layout is the same whether or not a scrollbar is present. The <code>scrollbar-gutter: stable</code> rule lets you tell the browser to reserve space for a scrollbar, even when a scrollbar isn’t there. This can prevent layout shifts from happening between states where scrollbars are needed or not needed. It <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_scrollbar-gutter">shipped</a> in Chrome 94, Edge 94 and Firefox 97, in 2021–22.</p>
<p>Safari has the most work to do to complete this Focus Area. Chrome and Firefox already pass 100% of the tests. Ironically, it was <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/363/styling-scrollbars/">Safari who first provided</a> the ability to style scrollbars with nine pseudo-elements, <code>::-webkit-scrollbar-*</code>, <a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=%3A%3A-webkit-scrollbar">back in 2009</a>. However that approach to styling scrollbars never became an official CSS web standard. The CSS Working Group instead <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-scrollbars/#out-of-scope">opted</a> for a far simpler approach.</p>
<h3><a name="starting-style-and-transition-behavior"></a>@starting-style and transition-behavior</h3>
<p>This Focus Area brings attention to two new features for controlling animation. <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_at-rules_starting-style">Both</a> <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_transition-behavior">shipped</a> in Chrome 117 and Edge 177 in Sept 2023.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@starting-style"><code>@starting-style</code></a> rule in CSS lets you define starting values for a particular element. This is needed when the element is about to go through a transition. It also provides a way for transitioning in or out of <code>display:none</code>.</p>
<pre><code>.alert {
  transition: background-color 2s;
  background-color: green;
  @starting-style {
    background-color: transparent;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>In the above example, the <code>background-color</code> will transition from transparent to green when the element is appended to the document.</p>
<p>Previously, only animations could animate <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_animated_properties#discrete">discretely-animatable</a> properties. The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition-behavior"><code>transition-behavior</code></a> property in CSS expands that capability to CSS transitions, paving the way for transitioning the <code>display</code> property when showing or hiding elements.</p>
<h3><a name="text-directionality"></a>Text Directionality</h3>
<p>The direction in which text flows is a vital aspect of typesetting on the web. Some languages flow from left-to-right, while others flow from <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-scripts">right-to-left</a>. One of the many bits of technology supporting <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/articlelist#direction">text direction</a> is the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/dir"><code>dir</code> attribute</a>. It lets you specifically mark any HTML element with the direction: <code>left</code>, <code>right</code>, or <code>auto</code> — where <code>auto</code> asks the browser to guess from the first letter. The interaction of directionality and shadow trees was not well-defined until recently. Now that it’s been addressed at a standards level, adding it to Interop 2024 helps us ensure implementations align as well.</p>
<h3><a name="text-wrap-balance"></a>text-wrap: balance</h3>
<p>Web designers have long wished for a way to prevent very short or one-word lines of text — often known as widows or orphans. Since the advent of responsive web design and the lack of control over the width of columns, this desire has gotten even more challenging. The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-wrap"><code>text-wrap</code></a> property provides you with multiple options for telling the browser how to wrap text with different methods for calculating line breaks for specific use cases.</p>
<p>The <code>text-wrap: balance</code> rule is a great solution for headlines. It balances a few lines of text so that each line has about the same amount of text as the others. It <a href="https://caniuse.com/css-text-wrap-balance">shipped</a> in Chrome 114 and Firefox 121, and is implemented in Safari Technology Preview.</p>
<p>Interop 2024 also includes tests of how <code>text-wrap-mode</code>, <code>text-wrap-style</code>, and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/white-space-collapse"><code>white-space-collapse</code></a> behave. The CSS Working Group recently changed to how these longhands interact with each other, so support is currently uneven between browsers. Interop 2024 will help ensure all browser engines update to the latest web standards.</p>
<h3><a name="url"></a>URL</h3>
<p>URLs are one of the most fundamental parts of the web. Without them, the web would not exist. But like many things invented very early in the history of the web, support has yet to be fully interoperable. To improve this, the WHATWG wrote the <a href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/">URL Living Standard</a> packed with details on exactly how URLs should work. The tests supporting this web standard were a focus area for Interop 2023, improving the pass rate from 77% to 85%. To ensure interoperability, the work in this area will continue in 2024.</p>
<p>Safari is proud to lead the pack, passing 99.7% of the tests. Improvements in other browsers will help ensure websites work correctly everywhere.</p>
<h2><a name="the-2024-investigation-projects"></a>The 2024 Investigation projects</h2>
<p>Interop 2024 also includes three investigation areas. These are “homework projects” for the Interop team to work on. All three this year are about writing and making it possible to run more tests — Accessibility Testing, Mobile Testing, and WebAssembly Testing. The Mobile Testing investigation project aims to complete the infrastructure needed at WPT to be able to test browsers on mobile operating systems, potentially to include those scores on the Interop project dashboard in the future.</p>
<p>While two of the three investigations are projects continuing from last year, they all are starting 2024 at zero percent done. Each team involved will set new goals for this year, and the dashboard will report progress on those goals.</p>
<h2><a name="track-the-progress"></a>Track the progress</h2>
<p>Keep up with the progress of Interop 2024 throughout the year, on the <a href="https://wpt.fyi/interop-2024">Interop 2024 dashboard</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="our-commitment"></a>Our Commitment</h2>
<p>We continue to believe that interoperability is one of the fundamental pillars that makes the web such a success. Our efforts in Interop 2022 and 2023 demonstrate how deeply we care about the web. We are excited to again collaborate with our colleagues in seizing this opportunity help the web work better for everyone.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://hirrolot.github.io/posts/sat-supercompilation.html">https://hirrolot.github.io/posts/sat-supercompilation.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39218173">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><a href="#supercompilation-by-example"><h2 id="supercompilation-by-example">Supercompilation by example</h2></a><p>Supercompilation is a deep program transformation technique due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentin_Turchin">V. F. Turchin</a>,
a prominent computer scientist, cybernetician, physicist, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_dissidents">Soviet
dissident</a>.</p><p>He described the concept as follows <a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>:</p><blockquote>
<p>A supercompiler is a program transformer of a certain type. The usual
way of thinking about program transformation is in terms of some set of
rules which preserve the functional meaning of the program, and a
step-by-step application of these rules to the initial program. … The
concept of a supercompiler is a product of cybernetic thinking. A
program is seen as a machine. To make sense of it, one must observe its
operation. So a supercompiler does not transform the program by steps;
it controls and observes (SUPERvises) the running of the machine that is
represented by the program; let us call this machine M<sub>1</sub>. In
observing the operation of M<sub>1</sub>, the supercompiler COMPILES a
program which describes the activities of M<sub>1</sub>, but it makes
shortcuts and whatever clever tricks it knows in order to produce the
same effect as M<sub>1</sub>, but faster. The goal of the supercompiler
is to make the definition of this program (machine) M<sub>2</sub>
self-sufficient. When this is acheived, it outputs M<sub>2</sub> in some
intermediate language L<sup>sup</sup> and simply throws away the
(unchanged) machine M<sub>1</sub>.</p>
</blockquote><p>A supercompiler is interesting not only as a program transformer but
also as a very general philosophical concept:</p><blockquote>
<p>The supercompiler concept comes close to the way humans think and
make science. We do not think in terms of rules of formal logic. We
create mental and linguistic models of the reality we observe. How do we
do that? We observe phenomena, generalize observations, and try to
construct a self-sufficient model in terms of these generalizations.
This is also what the supercompiler does. … A supercompiler would run
M<sub>1</sub>, in a general form, with unknown values of variables, and
create a graph of states and transitions between possible configurations
of the computing system. … To make it finite, the supercompiler performs
the operation of generalization on the system configurations in such a
manner that it finally comes to a set of generalized configurations,
called <em>basic</em>, in terms of which the behavior of the system can
be expressed. Thus the new program becomes a self-sufficient model of
the old one.</p>
</blockquote><p>Since the above explanations are hard to comprehend at first sight, I
will try to illustrate supercompilation <em>by example</em>.</p><p>Let the object language of supercompilation be a simple first-order
functional language called <em>SLL</em>, which stands for <em>Simple
Lazy Language</em>. It consists of:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Variables:</strong> just regular symbolic identifiers.
<ul>
<li>Examples: <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>c</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Constructors:</strong> symbolic identifiers that wrap their
arguments of arbitrary structure.
<ul>
<li>Examples: <code>Foo(a, b, c)</code>,
<code>Bar(a, Foo(a), c)</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>F-functions:</strong> <em>indifferent</em> functions that
just transform their arguments.
<ul>
<li>Examples:
<ul>
<li><code>foo(a, b, c) = Foo(a, b, Bar(c));</code></li>
<li><code>bar(a, b, c) = foo(Bar(a), b, c);</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>G-functions:</strong> <em>curious</em> functions that
pattern-match on their first argument.
<ul>
<li>Examples: see below.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p>Suppose that natural numbers are represented as <code>Z</code>,
<code>S(Z)</code>, <code>S(S(Z))</code>, and so on <a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.
Then, we can define addition as the following g-function (from <a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>):</p><div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1"></a>add(Z, y) = y;</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2"></a>add(S(x), y) = S(add(x, y));</span></code></pre></div><p>A supercompiler’s input is a pair of an expression and program, the
latter being a set of definitions of f- and g-functions. This pair is
usually called a <em>task</em>.</p><p>Let the task for a hypothetic supercompiler be the expression
<code>add(S(Z), S(S(Z)))</code> together with the definition of
<code>add</code> above. In this case, the work of a supercompiler is as
simple as sequential reduction of the initial expression to the target
expression <code>S(S(S(Z)))</code>, according to the rules of
<code>add</code>:</p><p><img src="https://hirrolot.github.io/media/sat-supercompilation/add-1-2.png" width="400px"></p><p>However, to think of a supercompiler as of a mere expression
evaluator is a grave mistake. Let us consider what happens when it
encounters a <em>variable</em> that does not stand for some concrete
expression. For example, let the task be <code>add(S(S(Z)), b)</code>
with the same definition of <code>add</code>, where <code>b</code> is
understood as “any” expression:</p><p><img src="https://hirrolot.github.io/media/sat-supercompilation/add-2-b.png" width="400px"></p><p>It <em>just</em> works!</p><p>A supercompiler saw the variable <code>b</code> when trying to reduce
<code>S(S(add(Z, b)))</code>, and then it just substituted
<code>y</code> (from the rule <code>add(Z, y)</code>) for this
<code>b</code>. After that, supercompilation has stopped because the
actual expression for <code>b</code> is unknown at this point. As a
result, we got <code>S(S(b))</code>, which is equivalent to the initial
expression.</p><p>Now consider what happens if there is a need to
<em>pattern-match</em> on an unknown variable. In this case, we cannot
just proceed with “direct” computation since there are several
possibilities of the form the variable may take. Suppose that the task
is <code>add(a, 2)</code> <a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> with the same function
<code>add</code>. What a supercompiler does is that it <em>analyze</em>
the expression <code>add(a, 2)</code> according to all the possibilities
of <code>a</code>, which are either <code>Z</code> or
<code>S(v1)</code>, where <code>v1</code> is some fresh variable
identifier. The situation looks like this:</p><p><img src="https://hirrolot.github.io/media/sat-supercompilation/add-a-2.png" width="600px"></p><p>A supercompiler has built an (incomplete) <em>process tree</em> that
describes the execution of <code>add(a, 2)</code> in a general sense. In
the first branch, <code>a</code> is substituted for <code>Z</code>
according to the first rule of <code>add</code>; in the second branch,
<code>a</code> is substituted for <code>S(v1)</code> according to the
second rule of <code>add</code>. The resulting two nodes are labelled
with expressions that resulted in reducing a particular substitution of
the parent expression.</p><p>However, the supercompilation is not complete yet: there is still a
node labelled as <code>S(add(v1, 2))</code>. A supercompiler decides to
<em>decompose</em> it, meaning to move <code>add(v1, 2)</code> out of
<code>S(...)</code> in the following way:</p><p><img src="https://hirrolot.github.io/media/sat-supercompilation/add-a-2-decompose.png" width="600px"></p><p>After that, if we proceed with supercompiling
<code>add(v1, 2)</code>, we will eventually arrive at the initial
expression <code>add(a, 2)</code>. This is because the expressions
<code>add(v1, 2)</code> and <code>add(a, 2)</code> are <em>alpha
equivalent</em>, meaning that they only differ in the names of
variables. A supercompiler should be smart enough to detect this
situation of alpha equivalence and, instead of continuing infinite
supercompilation, just draw a back arrow from <code>add(v1, 2)</code> to
the initial node as depicted below:</p><p><img src="https://hirrolot.github.io/media/sat-supercompilation/add-a-2-loop.png" width="600px"></p><p>Hooray, the supercompilation of <code>add(a, 2)</code> is now
complete!</p><p>What is left is to perform <em>residualization</em> – the process of
converting a process tree to an SLL task, a <em>self-sufficient
model</em> of the initial program. Every node in the graph (except for
leaf nodes) is transformed into a function whose parameters are the set
of free variables from the node expression; each function is given a
unique name. For example, if we see the node <code>add(a, 2)</code>
pointing to <code>2</code> and <code>S(add(v1, 2))</code>, we must
generate a new g-function of the following form:</p><div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1"></a>g1(Z) = ...;</span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2"></a>g1(S(v1)) = ...;</span></code></pre></div><p>We can complete the first branch by inserting <code>2</code> in place
of <code>...</code>:</p><div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1"></a>g1(Z) = 2;</span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2"></a>g1(S(v1)) = ...;</span></code></pre></div><p>Since the second branch leads to a node that decomposes a
constructor, we generate a new f-function and call it inside
<code>S</code>:</p><div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1"></a>g1(Z) = 2;</span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2"></a>g1(S(v1)) = S(f1(v1));</span>
<span id="cb4-3"><a href="#cb4-3"></a>f1(v1) = ...;</span></code></pre></div><p>According to the graph, the body of <code>f1</code> should be
<code>add(v1, 2)</code>, but since now <code>add</code> stands for
<code>g1</code>, the body will be <code>g1(v1)</code>:</p><div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1"></a>g1(Z) = 2;</span>
<span id="cb5-2"><a href="#cb5-2"></a>g1(S(v1)) = S(f1(v1));</span>
<span id="cb5-3"><a href="#cb5-3"></a>f1(v1) = g1(v1);</span></code></pre></div><p>Since <code>f1</code> is redundant, we can inline it as follows:</p><div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1"></a>g1(Z) = 2;</span>
<span id="cb6-2"><a href="#cb6-2"></a>g1(S(v1)) = S(g1(v1));</span></code></pre></div><p>This is the final residual <em>program</em>; the residual
<em>expression</em> will be <code>g1(a)</code>, since <code>a</code> is
the only free variable from the initial expression. As you can see, the
definition of <code>g1</code> is simpler than the original function
<code>add</code> in the sense that it accepts only one argument; the
second argument has been specialized to <code>2</code> during
supercompilation.</p><p>Perhaps a more interesting example would be specializing an
interpreter to a concrete program, obtaining a compiled “executable”. In
the partial computation literature, this is called the <em>first
Futamura projection</em> <a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>.</p><p>Consider the following interpreter <code>eq</code> (also from <a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>):</p><div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1"></a>eq(Z, y) = eqZ(y);</span>
<span id="cb7-2"><a href="#cb7-2"></a>eq(S(x), y) = eqS(y, x);</span>
<span id="cb7-3"><a href="#cb7-3"></a>eqZ(Z) = True;</span>
<span id="cb7-4"><a href="#cb7-4"></a>eqZ(S(x)) = False;</span>
<span id="cb7-5"><a href="#cb7-5"></a>eqS(Z, x) = False;</span>
<span id="cb7-6"><a href="#cb7-6"></a>eqS(S(y), x) = eq(x, y);</span></code></pre></div><p>which compares two Peano numbers for equality, resulting in either
<code>True</code> or <code>False</code>.</p><p>Now consider the expression <code>eq(S(S(Z)), x)</code> with the
above definition of <code>eq</code>; supercompilation will produce the
following residual program:</p><div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1"></a>eqZ3(Z) = True;</span>
<span id="cb8-2"><a href="#cb8-2"></a>eqZ3(S(v)) = False;</span>
<span id="cb8-3"><a href="#cb8-3"></a>eqS2(Z) = False;</span>
<span id="cb8-4"><a href="#cb8-4"></a>eqS2(S(v)) = eqZ3(v);</span>
<span id="cb8-5"><a href="#cb8-5"></a>eqS1(Z) = False;</span>
<span id="cb8-6"><a href="#cb8-6"></a>eqS1(S(v)) = eqS2(v);</span></code></pre></div><p>together with the residual expression <code>eqS1(x)</code>. In a
sense, we have obtained a compiled version of <code>eq</code>
specialized to <code>S(S(Z))</code>, because <code>eqS1</code>
pattern-matches only on an unknown variable <code>x</code> instead of
the known “program” <code>S(S(Z))</code>.</p><p>However, supercompilation is inherently more powerful than classical
partial evaluation. In Turchin’s own words <a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>:</p><blockquote>
<p>Although supercompilation includes partial evaluation, it does not
reduce to it. Supercompilation can lead to a very deep structural
transformation of the original program; it can improve the program even
if all the actual parameters in the function calls are variable. The
supercompilation process aims at the reduction of redundancy in the
original program, but this redundancy does not necessarily come from
fixed values of variables; it can result from nested loops, repeated
variables, and so on.</p>
</blockquote><p>That being said, a <a href="https://twitter.com/hirrolot/status/1741049231656280289">sufficiently
smart supercompiler</a> can transform a two-pass list mapping into a
single-pass algorithm, essentially performing <em>list fusion</em>:</p><p><img src="https://hirrolot.github.io/media/sat-supercompilation/list-fusion.jpeg"></p><p>A similar example can be found in <em>“Rethinking
Supercompilation”</em> by Neil Mitchell <a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> and
in <a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> (section 6, <em>“Examples of
supercompilation”</em>).</p><hr><p>Although I have deliberately skipped a few important aspects of
supercompilation, most notably termination checking (see homeomorphic
embedding <a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> <a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>

general topic of <em>metacomputation</em>. A more thorough introduction

Ideas and Methods”</em></a> by Ilya Klyuchnikov and Dimitur Krustev.</p><a href="#sat-and-dead-code-elimination"><h2 id="sat-and-dead-code-elimination">SAT and dead code
elimination</h2></a><p>Not let us consider how SAT can be reduced to the problem of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead-code_elimination">dead code
elimination</a>.</p><p>Consider a language whose expressions are:</p><ul>
<li><code>If (x, m, n)</code>, where <code>x</code> is a variable,
<code>m</code> and <code>n</code> are expressions.</li>
<li><code>T</code> and <code>F</code>, which are constants.</li>
</ul><p>This language is enough to encode any SAT problem. We can encode each
clause in the formula as follows (in pseudocode):</p><div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1"></a>OR(x, ...) = If (x, T, ...);</span>
<span id="cb9-2"><a href="#cb9-2"></a>OR(NOT x, ...) = If (x, ..., T);</span></code></pre></div><p>Then <code>OR(x, OR(y, OR(NOT z, F)))</code> would correspond to “x
OR y OR NOT z”:</p><p><img src="https://hirrolot.github.io/media/sat-supercompilation/if-x-y-not-z.png" width="550px"></p><p>Now consider the encoding of a conjunction of clauses <a href="#fn16" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a>:</p><div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1"><a href="#cb10-1"></a>AND(If(x, m, n), ...) = If(x, AND(m, ...), AND(n, ...));</span>
<span id="cb10-2"><a href="#cb10-2"></a>AND(T, ...) = ...;</span>
<span id="cb10-3"><a href="#cb10-3"></a>AND(F, ...) = F;</span></code></pre></div><p>Then <code>AND(OR(x, F), AND(OR(NOT y, F), T))</code> would
correspond to “x AND NOT y”:</p><p><img src="https://hirrolot.github.io/media/sat-supercompilation/x-and-not-y.png" width="550px"></p><p>Is the formula satisfiable? Yes, because we can assign <code>x</code>
to <code>T</code> and <code>y</code> to <code>F</code>.</p><p>Now consider the formula
<code>AND(OR(x, F), AND(OR(NOT x, F), T))</code>, which is equivalent to
“x AND NOT x”:</p><p><img src="https://hirrolot.github.io/media/sat-supercompilation/x-and-not-x.png" width="550px"></p><p>Is the formula satisfiable? To figure out, let us remove <em>dead
paths</em> from the formula:</p><p><img src="https://hirrolot.github.io/media/sat-supercompilation/if-x-f-f.png" width="550px"></p><p>We have replaced the lower <code>if x</code> node with its first
child <code>F</code> because <code>x</code> was already assigned
<code>T</code> in this path. Since there are no <code>T</code> leafs in
the resulting tree, it is correct to say that the formula is
unsatisfiable: with any value of <code>x</code> we will arrive at
<code>F</code>.</p><p>One more example is
<code>AND(OR(x, F), AND(OR(x, OR(y, F)), AND(OR(NOT x, F), T)))</code>,
which is equivalent to “x AND (y OR z) AND NOT x”:</p><p><img src="https://hirrolot.github.io/media/sat-supercompilation/if-last-example.png" width="600px"></p><p>After removing dead paths:</p><p><img src="https://hirrolot.github.io/media/sat-supercompilation/if-last-example-final.png" width="600px"></p><p>The general observation is that, after encoding a CNF formula as an
if-tree and removing dead paths from it, if there is at least one
<code>T</code> leaf, the initial formula is satisfiable; otherwise, the
formula is unsatisfiable because there is no path from the root that
will take us to <code>T</code>. Think about it for a moment.</p><p>Having this technique at our disposal, we can proceed to the key
section.</p><a href="#supercompilation-of-sat"></a><p><em>Positive supercompilation</em> is a particular model of
supercompilation that propagates only <em>positive information</em> when
doing case analysis. For example, when supercompiling
<code>add(a, 2)</code>, a positive supercompiler will substitute (i.e.,
propagate) <code>a=Z</code> and <code>a=S(v1)</code> to the respective
children nodes. On the other hand, <em>negative information</em> means
that some variable is <em>not</em> equal to a particular value (or
values); a typical example is the “default” case in a pattern-matching
construction. A <em>perfect supercompiler</em> is a supercompiler that
is able to propagate both positive and negative information.</p><p>In this post, we only deal with positive supercompilation. Consider
the schematic representation of the CNF formula “x AND NOT x” again:</p><p><img src="https://hirrolot.github.io/media/sat-supercompilation/x-and-not-x.png" width="550px"></p><p>Imagine that <code>if</code>, <code>T</code>, and <code>F</code> are
SLL constructors, with <code>if</code> holding three arguments: two
branches and a variable, which is <code>T</code> in the first branch and
<code>F</code> in the second. If we analyze the uppermost
<code>if x</code>, we will get the following “process tree” <a href="#fn17" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>:</p><p><img src="https://hirrolot.github.io/media/sat-supercompilation/if-x-f-f.png" width="550px"></p><p>Supercompilation acted as a dead code eliminator! This is because
<code>x=T</code> was propagated to the first branch of the uppermost
<code>if x</code>, resulting in the elimination of the branch
<code>T</code> of the innermost <code>if x</code>. The second uppermost
branch remains unchanged.</p><p>What if we somehow launch analysis of the whole if-tree? If so, we
would essentially eliminate all dead paths from the corresponding
expression, which is equivalent to solving the SAT problem! As I have
mentioned in the previous section, if there is at least one
<code>T</code> leaf in the final tree, the formula is satisfiable
because this <code>T</code> is reachable from the root. Otherwise (if
there is no <code>T</code>), the formula is unsatisfiable <a href="#fn18" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a>.</p><p>Here is a complete SAT solver written in SLL:</p><div id="cb11"><pre><code><span id="cb11-1"><a href="#cb11-1"></a>or(Var(x), rest) = If(x, T, rest);</span>
<span id="cb11-2"><a href="#cb11-2"></a>or(Not(x), rest) = If(x, rest, T);</span>

simplest (and the slowest!) SAT solver in the history of humanity.</p><p>The functions <code>or</code> and <code>and</code> are the encodings
of the logical OR and AND operations, respectively. The function
<code>solve</code> is the main entry point of the solver, and
<code>analyze</code> is a helper function that selects one of the two
branches of an <code>if</code>-expression according to the value of the
first argument. Since <code>solve</code> traverses the whole expression

<code>If</code>-nodes in the expression are case-analyzed when
<code>solve(formula)</code> is being supercompiled.</p><p>To test the solver, I will use my own <a href="https://gist.github.com/Hirrolot/35e3c40e49e01cfb11d67b6bcc67b23e">positive

SAT problem with only 10 lines of code in SLL.</p><p>There are several theoretical and practical consequences of this
discovery:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Theoretically,</strong> this means that a positive
supercompiler can solve SAT “automatically” – possibly mixed with a
number of other optimizations and code transformations. In other words,
it is possible that supercompilation can optimize your code based on the
knowledge of a solution to a particular SAT problem.
<ul>
<li>A direct consequence of this is that supercompiling a particular
task can have exponential time and space complexity. This is both good
and bad: the good part is that supercompilation is very smart, and the
bad part is that it can be <em>too smart</em> to serve as a predictable
code optimizer.</li>
<li>Since it is generally believed that there is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem">no
polynomial-time algorithm</a> to solve SAT, positive supercompilation is
also likely not to have it.</li>
<li>Since SAT is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-complete">NP-complete
problem</a>, meaning that it is at least as hard as any other problem in
NP, supercompilation is also at least as hard as any other problem in
NP. In other words, supercompilation has enough expressive power to
solve any NP problem <em>during the process</em>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Practically,</strong> using naive supercompilation as an
optimization pass would not be a good idea. However, since
supercompilation is a general method rather than a particular algorithm,
it should always be possible to restrict the expressive power of a
<em>particular</em> supercompiler to make it more predictable – albeit
less smart. See the technique of <em>speculative supercompilation</em>
from <a href="#fn19" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a>.
<ul>
<li>The SLL solver demonstrated in the previous section can serve as a
good stress test for a practical supercompiler.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p>Although the idea of supercompilation dates back to the 1970’s,
developing an industrial supercompiler is still an open problem.</p><p>If you find the post interesting, please share your thoughts in the

The same building blocks that power the marketplace enable other data collaboration use cases, like clean room data analysis and the automatic segmentation and delivery of data to other platforms.

Manifesto
Manufacturing is important. It’s the fundamental industry on which everything else is built. We take it for granted. In 1989, 35% of the entire software industry was manufacturing systems. Back then, services, hand holding, customization, and consulting were necessary to get the systems to where they are today. What was the first massive burst in productivity from technology has stagnated into incremental diminishing returns and exponentially increasing complexity. We can only continue to add complexity for so much longer until the whole system collapses.
"Any intelligent fool can make things bigger and more complex. It takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction."
Manufacturing is important. We must deliver a touch of technological genius to reintroduce simplicity, efficiency, and integration.

In the US, we spend an average of over $12,500 per person each year on healthcare -- that’s almost twice what other developed countries spend. Healthcare in the US costs a staggering $4 trillion dollars per year, almost 1/5 of our Nation’s entire economy. Yet with all this resource, our healthcare outcomes are poorer than other countries, people still can’t afford their healthcare, and our healthcare providers are burnt out.<p>Moreover, our healthcare is systemically unequal. People of color, lower income, and LGBTQ+ have demonstrably worse healthcare outcomes, a disparity grimly highlighted by the pandemic we’re living through now where people of color are three-times more likely to die from COVID-19.</p><p>How can this be, and how can we change it?</p><p>Nuna is tackling one of the most hardest problems in healthcare underlying the negative outcomes and disparities we see: how healthcare gets paid.</p><p>Today, hospitals only get paid when they do more-- more visits, more tests, more meds, more surgeries. Hopefully this helps patients get better, but regardless, the system gets paid. In fact, doing more is the only way to stay afloat.</p><p>But -- is this really the right set of incentives? Shouldn’t everyone get rewarded not just by doing more, but by when patients actually get better? Shouldn’t everyone have access to affordable, high quality care, and shouldn’t hospitals be rewarded when they deliver this care? And shouldn’t insurance companies get rewarded when they help ALL their patients get better?</p><p>Absolutely, yes. This concept is called Value-Based Care. In fact, healthcare as a whole has been trying to move in this direction for years, but making it all reality is deeply complex -- it is after all our healthcare. Nuna’s technology platform, our software apps, our vision, and our exceptionally talented team are collectively accelerating the healthcare system’s ability to make value-based care available to everyone.</p><p>In 2022, Nuna will power over $70B of healthcare payments for over 6.5M patients. We also leverage our data science and platform to direct patients to the best, culturally-matched, and accessible care providers for them. Additionally, we make it transparent and easy for both hospitals and insurers to see how they are performing in value-based care by spotlighting the patients or areas where they need to pay extra attention so that they can provide good care to all their patients and get rewarded.</p><p>Nuna is unique - we have brought together an exceptional team of over 200 people. We are the industry’s best in healthcare data, analytics, engineering, clinicians, and value based healthcare experts. We have joined forces to create a more equitable health system for everyone.</p><p>Our dreams and ambitions to change healthcare as we know it are big. If yours are too, we want to work with you.</p><p>Open positions include:</p><p>* Staff and Senior Health Data Engineer</p><p>* Senior Software Engineer - Program Development Kit Engine</p><p>* Staff Software Engineer, Data Serving</p><p>* Staff Software Engineer, Production Applications</p><p>Jobs Board: <a href="https://bit.ly/nuna-job-board" rel="nofollow">https://bit.ly/nuna-job-board</a></p><p>Frontend: React, Typescript</p><p>Backend: Django, Python, Kotlin, Scala</p><p>Cloud: AWS</p><p>Questions?

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I like Git commit messages.
Used well, I think they’re one of the most powerful tools available to document a codebase over its lifetime.
I’d like to illustrate that by showing you my favourite ever Git commit.</p>

<p>This commit is from my time at the Government Digital Service, working on GOV.UK.
It’s from a developer by the name of <a href="https://twitter.com/dancarley">Dan Carley</a>, and it has the rather unassuming name of “<a href="https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-puppet/commit/63b36f93bf75a848e2125008aa1e880c5861cf46">Convert template to US-ASCII to fix error</a>”.</p>

<p><img src="https://dhwthompson.com/assets/the-carley-commit.png" alt=""></p>

<p>A quick aside: one of <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2017/09/04/the-benefits-of-coding-in-the-open/">the benefits of coding in the open</a>, as practised at GDS, is that it’s possible to share examples like this outside the organisation that produced them.
I’m not sure who first introduced that idea to GDS –&nbsp;it was well-established by the time I joined –&nbsp;but I’m forever grateful to them.</p>

<h2 id="why-i-like-this-commit">Why I like this commit</h2>
<p>I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve shared this as an example of what commit messages can do.
It’s fun because of the ratio of commit message to code change, but that’s not why I think it’s worth sharing.</p>

<p>In a different organisation, from a different developer, this entire commit message might have been <code>change whitespace</code>, or <code>fix bug</code>, or (depending on the team’s culture) some less than flattering opinions about the inventor of the non-breaking space.
Instead, Dan took the time to craft a really useful commit message for the benefit of those around him.
I’d like to step through a few of the ways I think this is a really good example.</p>

<h3 id="it-explains-the-reason-for-the-change">It explains the reason for the change</h3>
<p>The best commit messages I’ve seen don’t just explain <strong>what</strong> they’ve changed: they explain <strong>why</strong>.
In this instance:</p>

<div><pre><code>I introduced some tests in a feature branch to match the contents of
`/etc/nginx/router_routes.conf`. They worked fine when run with `bundle exec
rake spec` or `bundle exec rspec modules/router/spec`. But when run as
`bundle exec rake` each should block failed with:

    ArgumentError:
      invalid byte sequence in US-ASCII
</code></pre></div>

<p>Without this level of detail, we could hazard a guess that this commit fixed some kind of parsing error in some tool or other.
Thanks to the commit message, we know exactly which tool it was.</p>

<p>This kind of information can be really valuable to document, and is all too easy to lose as people forget the original context behind their work, move on to other teams, and eventually leave the organisation.</p>

<h3 id="its-searchable">It’s searchable</h3>
<p>One of the first things in this commit message is the error message that inspired the change:</p>

<div><pre><code>ArgumentError:
  invalid byte sequence in US-ASCII
</code></pre></div>

<p>Anyone else who comes across this error can search through the codebase, either
by running <code>git log --grep "invalid byte sequence"</code> or by <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-puppet/search?q=%22invalid+byte+sequence%22&amp;type=Commits">using GitHub’s commit search</a>.
In fact, from the looks of the search results, multiple people did so, and found out who had found this problem before, when they came across it, and what they did about it.</p>

<h3 id="it-tells-a-story">It tells a story</h3>
<p>This commit message goes into a lot of detail about what the problem looked like, what the process of investigating it looked like, and what the process of fixing it looked like.
For example:</p>

<div><pre><code>I eventually found that removing the `.with_content(//)` matchers made the
errors go away. That there weren't any weird characters in the spec file. And
that it could be reproduced by requiring Puppet in the same interpreter
</code></pre></div>

<p>This is one of the areas commit messages can really shine, because they’re documenting the change itself, rather than documenting a particular file, or function, or line of code.
This makes them a great place to document this kind of extra information about the journey the codebase has taken.</p>

<h3 id="it-makes-everyone-a-little-smarter">It makes everyone a little smarter</h3>
<p>One thing Dan did here that I really appreciate was to document the commands he ran at each stage.
This can be a great lightweight way to spread knowledge around a team.
By reading this commit message, someone can learn quite a few useful tips about the Unix toolset:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they can pass an <code>-exec</code> argument into <code>find</code> to run a command against each file found</li>
  <li>that adding a <code>\+</code> onto the end of this command does something interesting (it passes many filenames into a single <code>file</code> command, rather than running the command once per file)</li>
  <li><code>file --mime</code> can tell them the MIME type of a file</li>
  <li><code>iconv</code> exists</li>
</ul>

<p>The person who reviews this change can learn these things.
Anyone who finds this commit later can learn these things.
Over enough time and enough commits, this can become a really powerful multiplier for a team.</p>

<div><pre><code>Now the tests work! One hour of my life I won't get back..
</code></pre></div>

<p>This last paragraph adds an extra bit of human context.
Reading these words, it’s hard not to feel just a little bit of Dan’s frustration at having to spend an hour tracking down a sneaky bug, and satisfaction at fixing it.</p>

<p>Now imagine a similar message attached to a short-term hack, or a piece of prototype code that made its way into production and set down roots (as pieces of prototype code love to do).
A commit message like this makes it much easier to remember that every change has a human on the other end of it, making the best decision they could given the information they had at the time.</p>

<h2 id="good-commits-matter">Good commits matter</h2>

<p>I’ll admit this is an extreme example, and I wouldn’t expect all commits (especially ones of this size) to have this level of detail.
Still, I think it’s an excellent example of explaining the context behind a change, of helping others to learn, and of contributing to the team’s collective mental model of the codebase.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in learning a bit more about the benefits of good commit messages, and some of the tools that make it easier to structure your changes around them, I can recommend:</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-dtm-region="articulo_cuerpo"><p>British author Anthony Burgess was inspired to write his best-known novel, <i>A Clockwork Orange</i> (1962), by the uncivil drift that he perceived among the youth of his time. That is why, a decade later, when headlines in the vein of “Police hunt the Clockwork Orange rapist gang” or “Child dies in Clockwork Orange war” started to appear in the press, he could not help but feel that something had gone tremendously wrong.</p><p>“The misunderstanding [of the novel] will pursue me until I die. I should not have written the book because of this danger of misinterpretation,” he wrote in 1985 in <i>Flame into Being</i>, a biography of D.H. Lawrence where he compared the scandal caused by <i>Lady Chatterley’s Lover</i> (1928) with the controversy surrounding his popular dystopia. “If a couple of nuns are raped in the Vatican, I get a call from a newspaper. They have turned me into some kind of expert <a href="https://english.elpais.com/culture/2023-12-11/fargo-is-back-to-bring-us-a-post-trump-cannibalistic-america.html">on violence</a>,” he lamented in a television interview. Burgess, however, was clear that his problems did not necessarily stem from the book, but from <a href="https://english.elpais.com/culture/2022-11-17/shelley-duvall-disappearance-and-return-of-an-icon-that-cinema-pushed-to-the-limit.html">Stanley Kubrick</a>’s 1971 film adaptation.</p><p>The 2023 documentary <i>Orange mécanique, les rouages de la violence</i> (in English, A clockwork orange: the prophecy), produced by the French division of the cultural television channel Arte, delves into the conflictive relationship between the writer and the title with which he went down in the history of 20th century literature – whether he liked it or not. The medium-length film is based on <i>The Clockwork Condition</i>, a manuscript written immediately after the release of the film and found after Burgess’ death, in which the author explained the themes of his novel and defended himself against those who accused him of glorifying crime. “All works of art are dangerous. My little son tried to fly after seeing Disney’s <i>Peter Pan</i>. I grabbed his legs just as he was about to take off from a fourth story window,” he stated. His desire to explain, and even vindicate himself, contrasted with the resigned attitude that he would maintain in the following decade, the 1980s.</p><h3><i>Singin’ in the Rain</i></h3><p>Both the film and the novel tell the story of Alex, a Beethoven-loving juvenile delinquent who, along with his three <i>droogs</i> (friends, according to the Nadsat language that they use to communicate), systematically beats and rapes until he is finally arrested. With the aim of getting out of prison as soon as possible, he volunteers for an experimental treatment known as the Ludovico technique, a behavioral conditioning therapy that erases all violent impulses from him. Deprived of moral choice, he becomes a person with no free will who is insulted and humiliated by everyone around him. The title, <i>A Clockwork Orange</i>, alludes, in the words of its author, to “the application of a mechanistic morality to a living organism oozing with juice and sweetness.”</p><figure><span><img alt="One of the violent scenes in ‘A Clockwork Orange,’ in which the main characters attack a woman." decoding="auto" height="621" srcset="https://images.english.elpais.com/resizer/3d4VPUJ61M958_qpsYYm9GPwScE=/414x0/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/prisa/ZOPWNYOUDRBNNG6G4COC2OWVVU.jpg 414w,https://images.english.elpais.com/resizer/redg90_UUjzvJAp3q3JhaV5AGUc=/828x0/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/prisa/ZOPWNYOUDRBNNG6G4COC2OWVVU.jpg 640w,https://images.english.elpais.com/resizer/hDui3u0PuvLHgCnHdT5gsJ5_Mv8=/980x0/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/prisa/ZOPWNYOUDRBNNG6G4COC2OWVVU.jpg 1000w,https://images.english.elpais.com/resizer/Gq5XUjFHCMsUxn9CECbhSUxPZ4I=/1960x0/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/prisa/ZOPWNYOUDRBNNG6G4COC2OWVVU.jpg 1960w" width="414" loading="lazy" src="https://images.english.elpais.com/resizer/3d4VPUJ61M958_qpsYYm9GPwScE=/414x0/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/prisa/ZOPWNYOUDRBNNG6G4COC2OWVVU.jpg" sizes="(min-width:1199px) 1155px,(min-width:1001px) calc(100vw - 44px),(min-width:768px) 767px, 100vw"><svg viewBox="0 0 40 40"><use xlink:href="#svg-ampliar"></use></svg></span><figcaption><span>One of the violent scenes in ‘A Clockwork Orange,’ in which the main characters attack a woman.</span><span>ullstein bild Dtl.

Kubrick himself, in response to a series of murder trials where the defendants explicitly mentioned his work, requested the withdrawal of <i>A Clockwork Orange</i> in the United Kingdom, where it could not be seen again until the director’s death in 1999.</p><p>Meanwhile, Burgess had unwittingly become its spokesman. The good relationship born from that collaboration, which seemed that would extend to a film about <a href="https://english.elpais.com/culture/2023-11-24/napoleon-the-great-man-leaves-me-cold.html">Napoleon </a>that Kubrick wanted to make, began to deteriorate when the filmmaker left the author and the lead actor, Malcolm McDowell, alone in front of the media to talk about <i>A Clockwork Orange</i> and its controversies. Burgess even attended several ceremonies to collect awards in Kubrick’s name. A public fatigue and a marked association with the film from which he was never able to recover. In the script of the 1984 stage adaptation, just in case there were any doubts about the esteem in which he held his former friend, Burgess introduced a character “with a beard like Stanley Kubrick’s” who played <i>Singin’ in the Rain</i> with a trumpet — before being kicked off the stage.</p><p>His weariness with the phenomenon and his distancing from his own creation grew and grew. Straightforwardly, in the prologue to the 1986 American reissue of the book, he dismissed its artistic merits, crediting Kubrick’s film as the sole reason why it continued to arouse the public’s interest: “I first published the novella <i>A Clockwork Orange</i> in 1962, which ought to be far enough in the past for it to be erased form the world’s literary memory. [...] I should myself be glad to disown it for various reasons,” he wrote. However, “it seems likely to survive, while other works of mine that I value more bite the dust.” He continued: “To sit down in a dull room and compose the <i>Missa Solemis</i> or <i>The Anatomy of the Melancholy</i> does not make headlines or news flashes. Unfortunately my little squib of a book was found attractive to many because it was as odorous as a crateful of bad eggs with the miasma of original sin.”</p><h3>Chapter 21</h3><p>Both that prologue and the recently released documentary place the point of conflict with the film not so much in its depiction of violence (“Kubrick turns violence into farce. He puts you in the position of wondering if you should laugh,” states writer Will Self, one of the interviewees) as in its omission of the final part, chapter 21, in which Alex actually reforms. The absence of that last piece was the result of an intervention by the American editor, who eliminated the chapter thinking that the outcome proposed in the previous pages was more suggestive. Kubrick thought so, too. In the film and in the American edition of the book, the effects of the Ludovico technique were reversed and Alex was able to go back to committing crimes at will. However, in Burgess’ complete text, Alex’s encounter with one of his former <i>droogs</i>, now married and with his own apartment, makes him reflect on his life and choose to abandon violence to start a family.

With that ending, he was putting the middle class as the savior against authoritarian states,” explains Eduardo Valls Oyarzun, teacher of English literature at the Complutense University of Madrid. “The problem with free will is the philosophical concept that the novel articulates and that he sees as the space where youth develops. When he starts to explore it, he notices the enormous burden of the influence of the state on that free will. His way of understanding good and evil in the novel is political, not metaphysical or moral in the classic religious sense. The authoritarian state penetrates the psyche of the individual, the self.”</p><p>The triggering incident for Burgess’ novel took place in 1942, when the writer’s first wife was brutally assaulted and beaten in London by three American deserters. She lost the baby she was expecting and, as a result of continuous internal bleeding, died a few years later. It is not difficult to find the reflection of this event in <i>A Clockwork Orange</i>: the husband of the woman who is raped by Alex and his <i>droogs</i> is an author who, in fact, is finishing a manuscript titled <i>A Clockwork Orange</i>. The documentary explains how, on his return to England after working in the British colony of Malaysia and the protectorate of Brunei, the writer found himself in a climate of alert due to the rise of juvenile delinquency. The rebellious subculture of the so-called teddy boys and the concerns raised by the importation of the <a href="https://english.elpais.com/usa/2023-05-16/how-the-american-dream-convinces-people-loneliness-is-normal.html">American lifestyle</a> and values crystallized clearly in the book, which found its definitive ingredient in the studies of behaviorism published by the psychologist Burrhus Frederic Skinner.</p><h3>Kennedy, Nixon and Warhol</h3><p>Before Kubrick, in 1965, Andy Warhol filmed his own adaptation of the novel and named it <i>Vinyl</i>. Composed of basically just one frame over the course of an hour, Warhol’s version drew from the same imaginary that Burgess relied on: the rise of a defiant adolescent aesthetic in line with the emerging figures of rock &amp; roll, from Marlon Brando in <i>On the Waterfront</i> (1954) to James Dean in <i>Rebel Without a Cause</i> (1955). Warhol formulated a subversive discourse, different from Burgess’ and whose homoerotic motifs also made the Ludovico technique a reference to conversion therapies.</p><p>In both the novel and Kubrick’s film, the characters of the author and his helpers were caricatured in their role as opponents of the government, depicted as a group of intellectuals who are more concerned with using Alex as a tool than with helping him. A disbelief towards the political sides that, again, was nuanced in the final chapter. “My book was Kennedyan and accepted the notion of moral progress. What was really wanted [in the American version that got rid of chapter 21] was a Nixonian book with no shred of optimism in it. Let us have evil prancing on the page and, up to the very last line, sneering in the face of all the inherited beliefs [...] about people being able to make themselves better,” reproached Burgess in 1986.</p><figure><span><img alt="Malcolm McDowell" decoding="auto" height="247" srcset="https://images.english.elpais.com/resizer/2qkUG5_grn23ksYK6l6DYJiI_4c=/414x0/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/prisa/P7UOB2JC6RCRPPJ43ZJP5L6RBQ.jpg 414w,https://images.english.elpais.com/resizer/Pfanl1OwtwDXKxk_WzPEVcffYfk=/828x0/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/prisa/P7UOB2JC6RCRPPJ43ZJP5L6RBQ.jpg 640w,https://images.english.elpais.com/resizer/gg0sK6uub9HjbPL1HIJ8LoPtfjI=/980x0/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/prisa/P7UOB2JC6RCRPPJ43ZJP5L6RBQ.jpg 1000w,https://images.english.elpais.com/resizer/Pcx_1C4z9IsEhWuVBEnJc3JMkTg=/1960x0/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/prisa/P7UOB2JC6RCRPPJ43ZJP5L6RBQ.jpg 1960w" width="414" loading="lazy" src="https://images.english.elpais.com/resizer/2qkUG5_grn23ksYK6l6DYJiI_4c=/414x0/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/prisa/P7UOB2JC6RCRPPJ43ZJP5L6RBQ.jpg" sizes="(min-width:1199px) 1155px,(min-width:1001px) calc(100vw - 44px),(min-width:768px) 767px, 100vw"><svg viewBox="0 0 40 40"><use xlink:href="#svg-ampliar"></use></svg></span><figcaption><span>Malcolm McDowell, star of ‘A Clockwork Orange.’</span><span>ullstein bild Dtl.

Maybe Anthony Burgess bought into that speech and began to see his novel as flawed,” believes teacher Eduardo Valls, regarding the writer’s disenchantment with the popularity of the book. “But for my taste, the distortion that the film makes is not significant. The problem with the adaptation is that it is much more essentialist, although it is not derivative, but rather stands on its own. I like to say that they are two different masterpieces.”</p><p>Related to <i>Brave New World</i> (1932) and <a href="https://english.elpais.com/culture/2022-11-26/1984-how-george-orwells-big-brother-was-born-during-the-spanish-civil-war.html"><i>1984</i> (1949)</a> as an example of the British dystopia of the 20th century (not in vain Burgess was a big admirer of George Orwell), <i>A Clockwork Orange</i> was an experiment in its author’s canon, although, in Valls’ opinion, it is not necessarily an orphan novel. “It diverts from his line, which is marked by the contemplation of the colonial world or his experience during his stays in Southeast Asia, but the problems that have to do with the definition of good and evil are inherent to his own work.” It is also not something that can be easily rejected. “What surrounded the film did not sit well with him. I think it was a subjective reaction. It’s a novel that became a popular and cultural phenomenon that undoubtedly transcends the author. Ask around; see how many people can name another Anthony Burgess book.”</p><p><i>Sign up for </i><a href="https://plus.elpais.com/newsletters/lnp/1/333/?lang=en"><i><u>our weekly newsletter</u></i></a> <i>to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA Edition</i></p></div></div>]]></description>

        <p>
          The New DSL 2024 has been reborn as a compact Linux distribution tailored for low-spec x86 computers. It packs a lot of applications into a small package. All the applications are chosen for their functionality, small size, and low dependencies. DSL 2024 also has many text-based applications that make it handy to use in a term window or TTY.
        </p>
	



        <p>
          DSL 2024 currently only ships with two window managers: Fluxbox and JWM. Both are lightweight, fairly intuitive, and easy to use.
        </p>
        <p>
          DSL has three X-based web browsers:
          </p><ul>
	    <li><strong>BadWolf</strong> (light, security-oriented, fully HTML5 compatible)</li>
            <li><strong>Dillo</strong> (super-light GUI browser)</li>
            <li><strong>Links2</strong> (text and light GUI browser)</li>
          </ul>
        
        <p>
          For office applications, DSL has:
          </p><ul>
            <li><strong>AbiWord</strong> word processor</li>
            <li><strong>Gnumeric</strong> spreadsheets</li>
            <li><strong>Sylpheed</strong> email client</li>
            <li><strong>Zathura</strong> PDF viewer</li>
          </ul>
        
        <p>
          For multimedia applications:
          </p><ul>
            <li><strong>MPV</strong> (video and audio)</li>
            <li><strong>XMMS</strong> (a lightweight audio player)</li>
          </ul>
        
        <p>
           Other applications:
         </p><ul> 
          <li><strong>mtPaint</strong> (graphics editing)</li>
          <li><strong>gFTP</strong> (FTP, SFTP, and SCP)</li>
          <li><strong>Leafpad</strong> (quick editing)</li>
          <li><strong>zzzFM</strong> (file manager lifted straight out of antiX)</li>
         </ul>
        
        <p>
          There are three GUI-based games picked because they are fun and relatively light.
        </p>
        <p>
          DSL 2024 is also loaded up with a whole bunch of handy term-based applications:
          </p><ul>
            <li><strong>Ranger</strong> file manager</li>
            <li><strong>VisiData</strong> a powerful CSV and spreadsheet tool</li>
            <li><strong>FZF</strong> fuzzy finder</li>
            <li><strong>Tmux</strong> terminal multiplexer</li>
            <li><strong>Mutt</strong> email client</li>
            <li><strong>Cmus</strong> music player</li>
            <li><strong>CDW</strong> CD burner</li>
            <li><strong>Htop</strong>, an interactive process viewer</li>
            <li><strong>SurfRaw</strong> (with wrapper) to search from the term</li>
            <li><strong>Weather App</strong></li>
            <li><strong>MPV</strong> video/audio player with wrapper</li>
            <li><strong>Vim</strong> and <strong>Nano</strong> for editing</li>
            <li>Five term-based games</li>
            <li>Two term-compatible web browsers: <strong>W3M</strong> and <strong>Links2</strong></li>
            <li>...and much more</li>
          </ul>
        
        <p>
          <strong>Why make a new DSL after all these years?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Creating the original DSL, a versatile 50MB distribution, was a lot of fun and one of the things I am most proud of as a personal accomplishment. However, as a concept, it was in the right place at the right time, and the computer industry has changed a lot since then. While it would be possible to make a bootable Xwindows 50MB distribution today, it would be missing many drivers and have only a handful of very rudimentary applications. People would find such a distribution a fun toy or something to build upon, but it would not be usable for the average computer user out of the gate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, in 2024, nearly everyone has abandoned the sub-700MB size limit to run on computers old enough to not have a DVD and cannot boot off of a USB drive. This is completely understandable because applications, the kernel, and drivers have all mushroomed in their space requirements. Hats off to Puppy Linux for staying one of the few that still offer a full desktop environment in a small size.
        </p>
        <p>
          The new goal of DSL is to pack as much usable desktop distribution into an image small enough to fit on a single CD, or a hard limit of 700MB. This project is meant to service older computers and have them continue to be useful far into the future. Such a notion sits well with my values. I think of this project as my way of keeping otherwise usable hardware out of landfills.
        </p>
        <p>
          As with most things in the GNU/Linux community, this project continues to stand on the shoulders of giants. I am just one guy without a CS degree, so for now, this project is based on antiX 23 i386. AntiX is a fantastic distribution that I think shares much of the same spirit as the original DSL project. AntiX shares pedigree with MEPIS and also leans heavily on the geniuses at Debian. So, this project stands on the shoulders of giants. In other words, DSL 2024 is a humble little project!
        </p>
        <p>
          Though it may seem comparably ridiculous that 700MB is small in 2024 when DSL was 50MB in 2002, I’ve done a lot of hunting to find small footprint applications, and I had to do some tricks to get a workable desktop into the 700MB limit. To get the size down, the ISO only has en_US, en_BG, en_CA, and en_AU locales enabled, and I had to strip the source codes, many man pages, and documentation out. I do provide a download script that will restore all the missing files, and so far, it seems to be working well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike the original DSL, this version has apt fully enabled. So if there is anything you feel is missing, it is very simple to get it installed. I also made an effort to leave as much of the antiX goodness enabled as possible. However, it must be said that DSL is a derivative work but also a reductive work. Some things from antiX may be broken or missing. If you find a bug, it is likely my fault.
        </p>

<p>What initially looked like a troll might turn out to be an actual PS4/PS5 vulnerability. While people shouldn’t get their hopes up just right now as this might fizzle, it’s more interesting than it initially looked on the surface.</p><!-- ezoic_video_placeholder-under_first_paragraph-854x480-999998-clearholder --><!-- ezoic_video_placeholder-under_first_paragraph-854x480-999998-nonexxxclearxxxblock --><!-- ezoic_video_placeholder-under_first_paragraph-640x360-999998-clearholder --><!-- ezoic_video_placeholder-under_first_paragraph-640x360-999998-nonexxxclearxxxblock --><!-- ezoic_video_placeholder-under_first_paragraph-426x240-999998-clearholder --><!-- ezoic_video_placeholder-under_first_paragraph-426x240-999998-nonexxxclearxxxblock --><!-- ezoic_video_placeholder-under_first_paragraph-384x216-999998-clearholder --><!-- ezoic_video_placeholder-under_first_paragraph-384x216-999998-nonexxxclearxxxblock -->
<p>Discussions about an 18 year old CVE have been making the rounds of PS4/PS5 hacking discords, forums, and Twitter over the past few days. Some people have been claiming that a Network bug disclosed in 2006 could&nbsp; be leveraged to Jailbreak recent PS4 and PS5 firmwares, and that this might even be the vulnerability (or one of the vulnerabilities in a chain) used by <a href="https://wololo.net/tag">TheFloW</a> in <a href="https://wololo.net/2023/09/23/spoiler-alert-dont-update-theflow-sets-the-ps4-ps5-scene-on-fire-once-again/">one of his most recent PlayStation bug bounties</a>.</p>
<p>Early tests seem to <strong>indicate that a crash is indeed present in PS4 up to 11.00 included, and PS5 8.20 included</strong>. (Which would put the patch for this issue at <a href="https://wololo.net/2023/12/06/ps5-firmware-8-40-and-ps4-11-02-are-out-and-theres-something-interesting-in-there-dont-update/">firmwares PS5 8.40 and PS4 11.02</a>)</p>
<p>I’ll be the first to admit I initially dismissed the original message as a troll, but <strong>it seems the claim has legs</strong>: a PoC (proof of concept) file has been circulating, and multiple people confirm it crashes their PS4 and PS5, up to the firmwares mentioned above. Now, <strong>a crash in itself is certainly not a vulnerability (let alone an exploitable one)</strong>, but this means the claim is now leaving the “troll” territory and becomes worth looking into. And there’s more…</p>
<h2>CVE From 2006 and PS4/PS5 crash PoC</h2>
<p>Before people become overly excited, I’d like to say that <strong>this should still be considered as a rumor, or, at the very least, something that could fizzle, until more skilled devs actually dig into the issue</strong>. However, here’s what happened so far:</p><!-- ezoic_video_placeholder-under_second_paragraph-854x480-999997-clearholder --><!-- ezoic_video_placeholder-under_second_paragraph-854x480-999997-nonexxxclearxxxblock --><!-- ezoic_video_placeholder-under_second_paragraph-640x360-999997-clearholder --><!-- ezoic_video_placeholder-under_second_paragraph-640x360-999997-nonexxxclearxxxblock --><!-- ezoic_video_placeholder-under_second_paragraph-426x240-999997-clearholder --><!-- ezoic_video_placeholder-under_second_paragraph-426x240-999997-nonexxxclearxxxblock --><!-- ezoic_video_placeholder-under_second_paragraph-384x216-999997-clearholder --><!-- ezoic_video_placeholder-under_second_paragraph-384x216-999997-nonexxxclearxxxblock -->
<ul>
<li>An old CVE From 2006 (<a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2006-4304/">CVE-2006-4304</a>) was <a href="https://wololo.net/2024/01/26/ps5-update-8-60-is-here-and-guess-what-dont-update/comment-page-1/#comment-6543161">initially reported</a> by some anonymous user to be a “PS4/PS5 KEX” a few days ago. Multiple people, including myself, initially dismissed the claim: “There’s no way a 18-year old FreeBSD 4 bug is present on the PS4 or the PS5, which are based on FreeBSD 9 or above”.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote><p><em>Buffer overflow in the sppp driver in FreeBSD 4.11 through 6.1, NetBSD 2.0 through 4.0 beta before 20060823, and OpenBSD 3.8 and 3.9 before 20060902 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (panic), obtain sensitive information, and possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted Link Control Protocol (LCP) packets with an option length that exceeds the overall length, which triggers the overflow in (1) pppoe and (2) ippp.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>This appears to be a bug in the Network stack of FreeBSD/NetBSD. Setting aside for a minute how crazy it would be that an 18 year old vulnerability is still present in modern consoles, at the very least this is an area of the code that we know TheFloW has been investigating a lot in the past (the only known PS5 Kernel exploit was from TheFloW and is related to the Network stack as well).</p>

<h2>Verdict: Is there a new vulnerability on the PS4/PS5?</h2>
<p>A few thoughts come to mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>In my opinion, if a bug from a CVE has been fixed on some system, it should generally not crash that system after the patch. I understand that in some rare scenarios, a crash is the only way out, but in my experience, most bug fixes intend to handle an error case gracefully. <strong>A crash is not an exploit</strong>, but it is very interesting to see that this code actually crashes the PS4 and PS5
<ul>
<li>A likely explanation, rather than an old bug surfacing, is a new one (or similar one) that happens to be triggered by taking a similar path in the code base.</li>
<li>It is also possible that some bits and pieces of the PS4/PS5 Network stack are not based on FreeBSD, but some other PS4/PS5 specific code that might still have the issue due to not be part of FreeBSD patches.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>It is particularly interesting to me that some more recent firmwares do not crash</strong>. This <strong>implies that Sony have fixed some issue, or modified some code in that area, in recent firmwares</strong> (which was actually <a href="https://wololo.net/2023/12/06/ps5-firmware-8-40-and-ps4-11-02-are-out-and-theres-something-interesting-in-there-dont-update/">strongly hinted at</a> when PS4 11.02 and PS5 8.40 were released). This is additional confirmation that this crash could be related to a recent vulnerability that was surfaced to Sony’s engineers (e.g. one of TheFloW’s bugs is not out of the question)</li>
<li>Some people have confirmed that the buggy code does, or did, exist, at some point, in the PS4’s codebase. SlidyBat over at the PS5 R&amp;D discord in particular says that there is indeed some function in the PS4 that seems to use the old buggy code:</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h5><strong>Short summary for those who are technically inclined:</strong></h5>

<p>CompVis fucked up the KL divergence loss on the KL-F8 VAE that is used by SD1.x, SD2.x, SVD, DALL-E 3, and probably other models.  As a result, the latent space created by it has a massive KL divergence and is smuggling global information about the image through a few pixels.  If you are thinking of using it for training a new, trained-from-scratch foundation model, <strong>don't!</strong> (for the less technically inclined this <strong>does not</strong> mean switch out your VAE for your LoRAs or finetunes, you absolutely do not have the compute power to change the model to a whole new latent space, that would require effectively a full retrain's worth of training.)  SDXL is not subject to this issue because it has its own VAE, which as far as I can tell is trained correctly and does not exhibit the same issues.</p>

<h3>What is the VAE?</h3>

<p>A Variational Autoencoder, in the context of a latent diffusion model, is the eyes and the paintbrush of the model. It translates regular pixel-space images into latent images that are constructed to encode as much of the information about those images as possible into a form that is smaller and easier for the diffusion model to process.</p>

<p>Ideally, we want this "latent space" (as an alternative to <em>pixel space</em>) to be robust to noise (since we're using it with a <em>denoising</em> model), we want latent pixels to be very spatially related to the RGB pixels they represent, and most importantly of all, we want the model to be able to (mostly) accurately reconstruct the image from the latent.  Because of the first requirement, the VAE's encoder doesn't output just a tensor, it outputs a probability distribution that we then sample, and training with samples from this distribution helps the model to be less fragile if we get things a little bit wrong with operations on latents.  For the second requirement, we use Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence as part of our loss objective: when training the model, we try to push it towards a point where the KL divergence between the latents and a standard Gaussian distribution is minimal -- this effectively ensures that the model's distribution trends toward being roughly equally certain about what each individual pixel should be.  For the third, we simply decode the latent and use any standard reconstruction loss function (LDM used LPIPS and L1 for this VAE).</p>

<h3>What is going on with KL-F8?</h3>

<p>First, I have to show you what a <em>good</em> latent space looks like.  Consider this image: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/DoYf4Ym.jpeg">https://i.imgur.com/DoYf4Ym.jpeg</a></p>

<p>Now, let's encode it using the SDXL encoder (after downscaling the image to shortest side 512) and look at the <em>log variance</em> of the latent distribution (please ignore the plot titles, I was testing something else when I discovered this): <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Dh80Zvr.png">https://i.imgur.com/Dh80Zvr.png</a></p>

<p>Notice how there are some lines, but overall the log variance is fairly consistent throughout the latent.  Let's see how the KL-F8 encoder handles this: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/pLn4Tpv.png">https://i.imgur.com/pLn4Tpv.png</a></p>

<p>This obviously looks very different in many ways, but the most important part right now is that black dot (hereafter referred to as the "black hole").  It's not a brain tumor, though it does look like one, and might as well be the machine-learning equivalent of one.  It's a spot where the VAE is trying to smuggle <strong>global information about the image</strong> through latent space.  This is exactly the problem that KL-divergence loss is supposed to prevent.  Somehow, it didn't.  I suspect this is due to underweighting of the KL loss term.</p>

<h3>What are the implications?</h3>

<p>Somewhat subtle, but significant.  Any latent diffusion model using this encoder is having to do a lot of extra work to get around the bad latent space.</p>

<p>The easiest one to demonstrate, is that the latent space is very fragile in the area of the black hole: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/8DSJYPP.png">https://i.imgur.com/8DSJYPP.png</a></p>

<p>In this image, I overwrote the mean of the latent distribution with random noise in a 3x3 area centered on the black hole, and then decoded it.  I then did the same on another 3x3 area as a control and decoded it.  The right side images are the difference between the altered and unaltered images.  <strong>Altering the latents at the black hole region makes changes across the whole image.</strong>  Altering latents anywhere else causes strictly local changes.  What we would want is strictly local changes.</p>

<p>The most substantial implication of this, is that these are the rules that the Stable Diffusion or other denoiser model has to play by, because this is the latent space it is aligned to.  So, of course, it learns to construct latents that smuggle information: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/WJsWG78.png">https://i.imgur.com/WJsWG78.png</a></p>

<p>This image was constructed by measuring the mean absolute error between the reconstruction of an unaltered latent and one where a <strong>single</strong> latent pixel was zeroed out.  Bright regions are ones where it is smuggling information.</p>

<p>This presents a number of huge issues for a denoiser model, because these latent pixels have a huge impact on the whole image and yet are treated as equal.  The model also has to spend a ton of its parameter space on managing this.</p>

<p>You can reproduce the effects on Stable Diffusion yourself using this code:</p>

<pre><code>import torch
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from tqdm import tqdm
from copy import deepcopy

pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5", torch_dtype=torch.float16, safety_checker=None).to("cuda")
pipe.vae.requires_grad_(False)
pipe.unet.requires_grad_(False)
pipe.text_encoder.requires_grad_(False)

def decode_latent(latent):
    image = pipe.vae.decode(latent / pipe.vae.config.scaling_factor, return_dict=False)
    image = pipe.image_processor.postprocess(image[0], output_type="np", do_denormalize=[True] * image[0].shape[0])
    return image[0]

prompt = "a photo of an astronaut riding a horse on mars"

latent = pipe(prompt, output_type="latent").images

original_image = decode_latent(latent)

plt.imshow(original_image)
plt.show()

divergence = np.zeros((64, 64))
for i in tqdm(range(64)):
    for j in range(64):
        latent_pert = deepcopy(latent)
        latent_pert[:, :, i, j] = 0
        md = np.mean(np.abs(original_image - decode_latent(latent_pert)))
        divergence[i, j] = md

plt.imshow(divergence)
plt.show()
</code></pre>

<h3>What is the prognosis?</h3>

<p>Still investigating this!  But I wanted to disclose this sooner rather than later, because I am confident in my findings and what they represent.</p>

<p>SD 1.x, SD 2.x, SVD, and DALL-E 3 (kek) and probably other models are likely affected by this.  You can't just switch them over to another VAE like SDXL's VAE without what might as well be a full retrain.</p>

<p>Let me be clear on this before going any further:  <strong>These models demonstrably work fine.  If it works, it works, and they work.</strong>  This is more of a discussion of the limits and if/when it is worth jumping ship to another model architecture.  I love model necromancy though, so let's talk about salvaging them.</p>

<p>Firstly though, if you are thinking of making a new, trained-from-scratch foundation model with the KL-F8 encoder, <strong>don't!</strong>  Probably tens of millions of dollars of compute have already gone towards models using this flawed encoder, don't add to that number!  At the very least, resume training on it and crank up that KL divergence loss term until the model behaves!  Better yet, do what Stability did and train a new one on a dataset that is better than OpenImages.</p>

<p>I think there is a good chance that the VAE could be fixed without altering the overall latent space too much, which would allow salvaging existing models.  Recall my comparison in that second to last image: even though the VAE was smuggling global features, the reconstruction still looked mostly fine without the smuggled features.  Training a VAE encoder would normally be an extremely bad idea if your expectation is to use the VAE on existing models aligned to it, because you'll be changing the latent space and the model will not be aligned to it anymore.  But if deleting the black hole doesn't destroy the image (which is the case here), it may very well be possible to tune the VAE to no longer smuggle global features while keeping the latent space at least similar enough to where existing models can be made compatible with it with at most a significantly shorter finetune than would normally be needed.  It may also be the case that you can already define a latent image within the decoder's space that is a close reconstruction of a given original without the smuggled features, which would make this task significantly easier.  Personally, I'm not ready to give up on SD1.5 until I have tried this and conclusively failed, because frankly rebuilding all existing tooling would suck, and model necromancy is fun, so I vote model necromancy!  This all needs actual testing though.</p>

<p>I suspect it may be possible to mitigate some of the effects of this within SD's training regimen by somehow scaling reconstruction loss on the latent image by the log variance of the latent.  The black hole is very well defined by the log variance: the VAE is <em>very certain</em> about what those pixels should be compared to other pixels and they accordingly have much more influence on the image that is reconstructed.  If we take the log variance as a proxy for the impact a given pixel has on the model, maybe you can better align the training objective of the denoiser model with the actual impact on latent reconstruction.  This is purely theoretical and needs to be tested first.  Maybe don't do this until I get a chance to try to fix the VAE, because that would just be further committing the model to the existing shitty latent space.</p>

<p>Failing this, people should recognize the limits of SD1.x and move to a new architecture.  It's over a year old, and this field moves fast.  Preferably one that still doesn't require a 3090 to run, please, I have one but not everyone does and what made SD1.5 so well supported was the fact that it could be run and trained on a much broader variety of hardware (being able to train a model in a decent amount of time with less than an A100-80GB would also be great too).  There are a lot of exciting new architectural changes proposed lately with things like Hourglass Diffusion Transformers and the new Karras paper from December to where a much, much better model with a similar compute footprint is certainly possible.  And we knew that SD1.5 would be fully obsolete one day.</p>

<p>I would like to thank my friends who helped me recognize and analyze this problem, and I would also like to thank the Glaze Team, because I accidentally discovered this while analyzing latent images perturbed by Nightshade and wouldn't have found it without them, because I guess nobody else ever had a reason to inspect the log variance of the latent distributions created by the VAE.  I'm definitely going to be performing more validation on models I try to use in my projects from now on after this, Jesus fucking Christ.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p><span>I</span>n April 2023, a 54-year-old programmer named Gary Bowser was released from prison having served 14 months of a 40-month sentence. Good behaviour reduced his time behind bars, but now his options are limited. For a while he was crashing on a friend’s couch in Toronto. The weekly physical therapy sessions, which he needs to ease chronic pain, were costing hundreds of dollars every week, and he didn’t have a job. And soon, he would need to start sending cheques to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/nintendo" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Nintendo</a>. Bowser owes the makers of Super Mario $14.5m (£11.5m), and he’s probably going to spend the rest of his life paying it back.</p><p>Since he was a child, Bowser’s life has revolved around tinkering with electronics. His dad was a mechanical engineer, and he learned from him how to wire up model trains and mod calculators. As a teenager he already had a computer business: his mother died when he was 15, his father had retired and Bowser supported him.</p><p>Bowser would go on to run an internet cafe, where patrons played Counter-Strike and Dance Dance Revolution, and repair hardware for a living. He got briefly caught up with the law during a stint fixing games consoles at flea markets, which nearly implicated him alongside vendors who sold pirated movies. Eventually he moved to the Dominican Republic in 2010. He spoke no Spanish for years, but he loved the place anyway: you could drive from one end to the other in just 12 hours, he recalls. It was here that Bowser – who, in a case of nominative determinism that feels almost too trite to acknowledge, shares a name with Super Mario’s in-game antagonist – started becoming the face of Nintendo piracy.</p><figure id="b10bf95c-76f7-4cbe-9f65-7608eb4e67ed" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c88a3e35b93879ff8c669107edb5c87060c526bb/0_94_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c88a3e35b93879ff8c669107edb5c87060c526bb/0_94_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c88a3e35b93879ff8c669107edb5c87060c526bb/0_94_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c88a3e35b93879ff8c669107edb5c87060c526bb/0_94_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c88a3e35b93879ff8c669107edb5c87060c526bb/0_94_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c88a3e35b93879ff8c669107edb5c87060c526bb/0_94_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Gary Bowser, left, in his 20s demonstrating projects for the TI-99 home computer event at the Chicago TI fair in the early 90s." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c88a3e35b93879ff8c669107edb5c87060c526bb/0_94_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="267.04345703125" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Gary Bowser, left, in his 20s demonstrating projects for the TI-99 home computer event at the Chicago TI fair in the early 90s.</span> Photograph: Courtesy of Gary Bowser</figcaption></figure><p>In the late 00s he made contact with Team Xecuter, a group that produces dongles used to bypass anti-piracy measures on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/nintendo-switch" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Nintendo Switch</a> and other consoles, letting them illegally download, modify and play games.

He was imprisoned in a series of jails, and each transfer had Covid safety precautions that required him to spend time in isolation. Despite this, Bowser still caught the coronavirus and spent two weeks so sick that, he says, a priest would come over once a day to read him a prayer.</p><p>Bowser was charged with fraud over his connection to Team Xecuter. While in custody, he was also hit with a civil suit from Nintendo. Between the civil and criminal cases, he was ordered to pay $14.5m.</p><p>In transcripts from the court, Nintendo’s lawyer Ajay Singh outlined the company’s case against piracy. “It’s the purchase of video games that sustains Nintendo, and it is the games that make the people smile … It’s for that reason that we do all we can to prevent games on Nintendo systems from being stolen,” he told the judge.</p><p>Pirates are usually fined in court, but Bowser’s case was <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-said-hacker-gary-bowsers-jail-sentence-was-a-unique-opportunity-to-send-a-message/" data-link-name="in body link">meant to draw attention</a>. “The sentence was like a message to other people that [are] still out there, that if they get caught … [they’ll] serve hard time,” he says. As he tells it, Bowser didn’t make or develop the products that sent him to prison; he “just” updated the websites that told people what they could buy, and kept them informed about what was coming next.</p><p>Bowser maintains that he could have fought the allegations, and that other members of the hacking group remain at large. But fighting against 13 charges would have cost time and money. It was easier, he claims, to plead guilty and only deal with a couple of the charges. As a part of that agreement, Bowser now has to send Nintendo 20-30% of any money left over after he pays for necessities such as rent.</p><figure id="0426fbdb-aa06-47c5-aee3-f67b8879dad9" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-4"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3810cefd9978a550e8be67c5bbd5b0238f6cb55f/0_856_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3810cefd9978a550e8be67c5bbd5b0238f6cb55f/0_856_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3810cefd9978a550e8be67c5bbd5b0238f6cb55f/0_856_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3810cefd9978a550e8be67c5bbd5b0238f6cb55f/0_856_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3810cefd9978a550e8be67c5bbd5b0238f6cb55f/0_856_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3810cefd9978a550e8be67c5bbd5b0238f6cb55f/0_856_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="The Nintendo offices in Kyoto." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3810cefd9978a550e8be67c5bbd5b0238f6cb55f/0_856_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="267" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>‘I’ll pay them what I can, which won’t be very much money, that’s for sure’ … the Nintendo offices in Kyoto.</span> Photograph: Askar Karimullin/Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>“I’ll pay them what I can, which won’t be very much money, that’s for sure,” he says.

It’s better than the time he spent homeless in his early 20s, he says. “I have experienced many things over the years, bad situations and good.” He carried an optimistic outlook even while imprisoned; at one point he was paid to counsel other prisoners on suicide watch. “A lot of other people were going crazy, banging their cell doors, screaming, yelling, harming themselves,” he says. Bowser was paid a dollar an hour to help them, and his four-hour shifts allowed him to start chipping away at his pending bill. “When I was in jail, I was paying Nintendo $25 a month,” he recalls.</p><p>While inside, Bowser couldn’t always get the medical attention he needed, he claims, and even when he did, the realities of prison still exacerbated his health issues – he has elephantiasis in his left leg. At times, due to Covid, Bowser could only leave his cell a few times a week and only for about 10 minutes. The rest of the time, he spent sitting.</p><p>“For a while I couldn’t even get a shoe on my left foot, so I was walking around barefoot,” he recalls.</p><figure id="6b1f0769-adc3-4f75-b479-db2d03758631" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-5"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7dcb330c110a16a19f6768f55f449abda5633fc/159_257_1750_1050/master/1750.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7dcb330c110a16a19f6768f55f449abda5633fc/159_257_1750_1050/master/1750.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7dcb330c110a16a19f6768f55f449abda5633fc/159_257_1750_1050/master/1750.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7dcb330c110a16a19f6768f55f449abda5633fc/159_257_1750_1050/master/1750.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7dcb330c110a16a19f6768f55f449abda5633fc/159_257_1750_1050/master/1750.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7dcb330c110a16a19f6768f55f449abda5633fc/159_257_1750_1050/master/1750.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Bowser at FDC SeaTac prison at Christmas in 2022." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7dcb330c110a16a19f6768f55f449abda5633fc/159_257_1750_1050/master/1750.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="267" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>‘When I was in jail, I was paying Nintendo $25 a month’ … Bowser at FDC SeaTac prison, Christmas in 2022.</span> Photograph: Courtesy of Gary Bowser</figcaption></figure><p>At least there was a wheelchair to help him get around. Nowadays, Bowser only has a cane – but his leg hasn’t let-up. Bowser goes to physical therapy three times a week, but it’s expensive. He is estranged from his family. Instead, it’s his friends who are helping him buy food and clothes. He pays for medical care from a GoFundMe page dedicated to helping him restart his life, which received a few dozen donations. He is hoping that he can get disability payments soon. Since he got out, he’s often gone without access to a refrigerator or a stove due to trouble paying his electricity bills.</p><p>In the meantime, and after months of inconsistent access to the internet, Bowser is looking for jobs. On his website, he lists all the services he can provide and while he has found a few coding gigs, he’s been having a hard time securing anything long-term. Any prospective employer who does a background check will of course see his legal history with Nintendo, but that may not work against him.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
            <p><a href="https://pkg.go.dev/filippo.io/mlkem768?ref=words.filippo.io">filippo.io/mlkem768</a> is a pure-Go implementation of ML-KEM-768 optimized for correctness and readability. ML-KEM (formerly known as Kyber, renamed because we can’t have nice things) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum_cryptography?ref=words.filippo.io">post-quantum</a> key exchange mechanism in the process of being standardized by NIST and adopted by most of the industry.</p>
<p>The package amounts to <a href="https://github.com/FiloSottile/mlkem768/blob/main/mlkem768.go?ref=words.filippo.io">~500 lines of code</a>, plus 200 lines of comments, and 650 lines of tests. It has no dependencies except for golang.org/x/crypto/sha3. It’s meant for <a href="https://go.dev/cl/550215?ref=words.filippo.io">upstreaming</a> into the Go standard library (initially as an internal-only package used in an opt-in crypto/tls experiment) and was designed to provide high security assurance through ease of review, simplicity, and thorough testing.</p>
<p>I livecoded part of its development <a href="https://twitch.tv/filosottile?ref=words.filippo.io">on Twitch</a>, and you can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyB7A93C-V0&amp;ref=words.filippo.io">the replay on YouTube</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike most other implementations, this code was not ported from the reference pq-crystals library, but written from scratch not having ever closely read other codebases. This was an intentional exercise in spec validation, to show it is possible to produce an interoperable implementation from the specification alone.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.203.ipd.pdf?ref=words.filippo.io">FIPS 203 document</a> turned out to be an excellent implementation guide, with detailed pseudo-code, exhaustive definitions, and consistent type information. (This is something I would like to ask of any large specification document: define your types and use them and denote them!) To make the code both easier to review and better as a learning resource, function and variable names, and even operation ordering, are carefully picked to mirror the FIPS specification.</p>
<p>The specification actually requires fairly limited math background, but to facilitate the work of implementers, I wrote up <a href="https://words.filippo.io/dispatches/kyber-math/">Enough Polynomials and Linear Algebra to Implement Kyber</a>.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the only parts left as an exercise to the reader were</p>
<ol>
<li>implementing arithmetic modulo the prime 3329;</li>
<li>concretely implementing the compress and decompress functions mapping values [0, 3329) to and from [0, 2ᵈ); and</li>
<li>ensuring constant time operations.</li>
</ol>
<p>Modulo arithmetic was reasonably easy, as we all collectively learned a lot about finite field arithmetic through years of RSA and elliptic curve implementations. The small prime actually makes the task feel unnaturally simple.</p>
<p><a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.203.ipd.pdf?ref=words.filippo.io#equation.4.5">Compression and decompression</a> turned out to be the most difficult part of the project. The specification defines them in abstract terms as fractions and rounding rules—“just” compute (2ᵈ/q)·x or (q/2ᵈ)·y and round to the closest integer—but in practice we need to implement them with constant time arithmetic and bitwise operations! In my <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/list.nist.gov/g/pqc-forum/c/n8dsN_aMsa8/m/NHO2lNyWAAAJ?ref=words.filippo.io">public comments</a> I pointed out that having each implementation figure out a strategy is risky and redundant. I was more correct than I thought: it turned out that <a href="https://github.com/pq-crystals/kyber/commit/dda29cc63af721981ee2c831cf00822e69be3220?ref=words.filippo.io">the reference implementation and ~every implementation ported from it used a division</a> which depending on compiler optimizations and platform might result in a DIV instruction, which is variable-time even when the divisor is fixed. This package was unaffected, because it used <a href="https://www.nayuki.io/page/barrett-reduction-algorithm?ref=words.filippo.io">Barrett reduction</a> from the start, like BoringSSL.</p>
<p>You can read <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/list.nist.gov/g/pqc-forum/c/n8dsN_aMsa8/m/NHO2lNyWAAAJ?ref=words.filippo.io">the rest of my formal public comments</a> on the pqc-forum mailing list.</p>
<p>Readability was a major goal of the implementation, and it was pursued <s>even</s> especially for complex functions like compression and decompression. A readable implementation has two purposes: first, it allows effective review, both during the code review process and later by interested researchers, improving security; second, it serves as an educational resource for the next generation of maintainers and cryptography engineers (or curious nerds). Reading the Go cryptography standard library is how I got started on the path that led me here, so it is especially important to me to preserve and improve it as a learning resource. It’s obviously subjective, but I believe this to be the most understandable public ML-KEM/Kyber implementation. Compare for example <a href="https://github.com/FiloSottile/mlkem768/blob/344d5ee2c575ca84613bbb119c1d8b1ef6699ea5/mlkem768.go?ref=words.filippo.io#L394-L442">our compression/decompression functions</a> with <a href="https://github.com/pq-crystals/kyber/blob/11d00ff1f20cfca1f72d819e5a45165c1e0a2816/ref/poly.c?ref=words.filippo.io#L9-L112">the reference implementation</a>.</p>
<p>Sometimes improving readability and reviewability means making code longer and less reusable: for example for ML-KEM-768 we need to serialize 1-, 4-, 10-, and 12-bit integers in a packed format. A universal 1-to-12 bit encoder and decoder is a pretty gnarly piece of code to write correctly, but each of those four sizes are actually pretty easy to write a dedicated encoder/decoder for.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> This is why we have <code>ringCompressAndEncode1/4/10</code> etc. instead of a single universal function. This also made it easy to work some special required checks into the 12-bit decoder.</p>
<p>This, by the way, was only possible because we targeted ML-KEM-768 specifically, or we’d have had to implement 5- and 11-bit encodings, as well. ML-KEM is specified at three security levels (-512, -768, and -1024). However, the Kyber team recommends using -768 over -512 for a more conservative security margin against novel cryptanalysis, while -1024 exists only for the same reasons 256-bit security levels exist: compliance and blind <a href="https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/05/25/strengthmatching.html?ref=words.filippo.io">strength matching</a>. Most protocols being tested or standardized coalesced around ML-KEM-768, so targeting only that improves not only readability, but also security (because there are fewer moving parts), and performance (because we can optimize allocation sizes, iteration counts, and encoding algorithms) at little to no cost.</p>
<p>After readability, testing is the main component in this package’s high security assurance strategy. Besides checking that key generation, encapsulation, and decapsulation round-trip correctly, and maintaining a test coverage of 95%+, we</p>
<ul>
<li>ensure interoperability with <a href="https://github.com/FiloSottile/mlkem768/blob/344d5ee2c575ca84613bbb119c1d8b1ef6699ea5/testdata/vectors.json?ref=words.filippo.io">test vectors obtained from NIST and other implementations</a>;</li>
<li>exhaustively test every input combination for base field arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, and multiplication modulo 3329) against expected values computed trivially with variable-time operations;</li>
<li>exhaustively test compression and decompression against math/big.Rat (contributed by David Buchanan);</li>
<li>test that pre-computed constants match their definition;</li>
<li>check that incorrect lengths (both long and short) cause the appropriate error for every input of every function;</li>
<li>run an extensive set of reusable test vectors we developed (see below);</li>
<li>run test vectors <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/list.nist.gov/g/pqc-forum/c/aCAX-2QrUFw/m/hy5gwcESAAAJ?ref=words.filippo.io">provided by Sophie Schmieg</a> which will be eventually included in <a href="https://github.com/google/wycheproof?ref=words.filippo.io">Wycheproof</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our test vectors are designed to be reusable by other implementations, and <a href="https://c2sp.org/CCTV/ML-KEM?ref=words.filippo.io">are published as part of the CCTV project</a> along with detailed <a href="https://github.com/C2SP/CCTV/blob/main/ML-KEM/README.md?ref=words.filippo.io#intermediate-values">intermediate values</a> for testing and debugging each intermediate step and partial algorithm, which we used during development. There are different sets of tests vectors, each designed to reach different edge cases.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/C2SP/CCTV/blob/main/ML-KEM/README.md?ref=words.filippo.io#bad-encapsulation-keys">Negative test vectors</a> provide invalid encapsulation keys, where the coefficients are higher than 3329. These were often requested, since all the test vectors from the Kyber and NIST teams are for regular, correct inputs. These vectors individually test every value from 3329 to 2¹²-1 and every coefficient location, sharing the remaining coefficients so they compress from 1–3 MiB down to 12–28 KiB.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/C2SP/CCTV/blob/main/ML-KEM/README.md?ref=words.filippo.io#unlucky-ntt-sampling-vector">“Unlucky” vectors</a> require an unusually large number of XOF reads. Kyber samples a matrix from a portion of public keys<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> with <em>rejection sampling</em>: it gets a random value between 0 and 2 ¹²-1 and checks if it’s less than 3329, if not, it tries again. The amount of bytes needed to sample a matrix depends on how lucky you get with the sampling, and that’s a random function of the public key component. These vectors are regular public keys and require reading more than 575 bytes from the SHAKE-128 XOF in SampleNTT, which would ordinarily happen with probability 2⁻³⁸. Sophie’s vectors were bruteforced further, and require up to 591 bytes.</p>

<p>At this point I would like to thank our detection and response team for not killing my job(s) hashing vast amounts of random seeds and looking for zeroes in the output. — Sophie Schmieg</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Special vectors <a href="https://github.com/C2SP/CCTV/blob/main/ML-KEM/README.md?ref=words.filippo.io#strcmp-vectors">fail if strcmp is used</a> in ML-KEM.Decaps. In ML-KEM.Decaps the ciphertext is compared with the output of K-PKE.Encrypt for implicit rejection. If an implementation were to use <code>strcmp()</code> for that comparison it would fail to reject some ciphertexts if a zero byte terminates the comparison early. This one I hope is going to sit as a silent trap for years—who would use <code>strcmp()</code> in cryptographic code—and then ruthlessly kill a vulnerability, because of course someone will.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/C2SP/CCTV/blob/main/ML-KEM/README.md?ref=words.filippo.io#accumulated-pq-crystals-vectors">Accumulated vectors</a> (derived from the reference pq-crystals implementation) allow testing randomly reachable edge cases without checking in large amounts of data. The reference implementation of Kyber includes a <code>test_vectors.c</code> program that generates 300MB of random vectors. I had no intention of checking in the output or compiling C, but since they are just randomly generated vectors, we can regenerate them in our tests from the deterministic RNG (SHAKE-128 with an empty input) and check they hash to an expected value. We can even take it further, and produce hashes for a million random tests, beyond the 10k they generate.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I am happy to report that none of the tests, many introduced after completion of the implementation, identified any issues in filippo.io/mlkem768. There is <a href="https://github.com/C2SP/CCTV/issues/7?ref=words.filippo.io">at least one reported instance</a> of the negative vectors identifying a defect in a major implementation, though.</p>
<p>Performance is not a primary goal (neither of this package nor of <a href="https://go.dev/design/cryptography-principles?ref=words.filippo.io">the Go cryptography packages</a>) but the package needs to be fast enough to be useful. Thankfully, ML-KEM is pretty fast, to the point that this simple implementation is competitive with our assembly-optimized P-256 and X25519 implementations.</p>
<p>To compare apples to apples, note that we need to compare the whole operation that each side needs to perform for key establishment: for ECDH, two scalar multiplications (one of them by the fixed base point); for KEMs, key generation and decapsulation on one side, and encapsulation on the other. ECDH is symmetrical, ML-KEM key establishment is not.</p>
<p>The ECDH benchmarks below already include the two scalar multiplications, while the mlkem768 benchmarks are split as key generation and decapsulation under “Alice” and encapsulation under “Bob”. Since decapsulation includes a full encryption (to check the resulting ciphertext matches the input), Alice takes a lot longer than Bob: the latter does an encryption, while the former does an encryption, a decryption, and a key generation.</p>
<p>All in all, “Bob” is as fast as our X25519 or P-256, while “Alice” takes less than twice. Compared to some of the fastest ML-KEM implementations out there (BoringSSL and libcrux), this package takes approximately double the time. For such a simple and unoptimized implementation, this is more than satisfactory.</p>

<p>The performance wasn’t entirely free. In general, I followed high-performance Go programming patterns, trying for example to minimize heap allocations. Next, I <a href="https://go.dev/cl/544817/2?ref=words.filippo.io">reworked the x/crypto/sha3 package</a> so it could be used without any heap allocation thanks to <a href="https://words.filippo.io/efficient-go-apis-with-the-inliner/">the mid-stack inlining trick</a>. However, I haven’t merged those changes yet and they are not included in the benchmarks above, because they have a negative effect on Apple M2 processors. No idea why yet.</p>

<p>The one successful optimization was complaining about the confusing result above on the Gophers Slack <code>#performance</code> channel, which sniped Josh Bleecher Snyder into contributing <a href="https://github.com/FiloSottile/mlkem768/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Ajosharian&amp;ref=words.filippo.io">a couple changes</a> :)</p>
<p>There is some low hanging fruit still: key generation and decapsulation both sample a matrix from the same value, and since the two are usually done sequentially on the Alice side, the matrix could be stored saving around 10% time. There might be an opportunity to save a copy in the sha3 read path, too. After that, it’s a matter of optimizing the field implementation.</p>

<h2 id="bonus-track-using-a-ml-kem-implementation-as-kyber-v3">Bonus track: using a ML-KEM implementation as Kyber v3</h2>
<p>NIST made a few small changes to the Round 3 submission of Kyber. They are summarized in Section 1.3 of the FIPS draft.</p>
<p>However, there are a few experimental protocols defined in terms of Kyber v3 (or “draft00”), including the main deployed PQ TLS key exchange. Do we have to make a separate package to support them?</p>
<p>Luckily, no we don’t.</p>
<p>One change adds some validation for an edge case (non-canonical coefficient encodings in public keys) that was undefined in Kyber. Honest implementations will not produce such keys, so we can reject them as specified in the FIPS draft. It will make it possible to fingerprint our implementation as Kyber-on-ML-KEM but will be otherwise harmless.</p>
<p>One change removed a hashing step applied to CSPRNG input. Since those bytes are random, it’s impossible for any party to tell the difference.</p>
<p>The final change is the major one, and the trickiest. The ciphertext used to be hashed into the shared secret. This difference would prevent interoperability. However, the mixing happens as an additional key derivation, which was entirely removed in ML-KEM, which instead returns the value K as-is. This means we can run ML-KEM to generate the shared secret K and then apply</p>
<pre><code>SHAKE-256(K || c)[:32]
</code></pre>
<p>to generate the Kyber shared secret. No need to break the ML-KEM abstraction.</p>
<p>There’s one wrinkle: both Kyber and ML-KEM perform implicit rejection in Decapsulate by hashing a secret with the ciphertext and returning that as the shared secret. If we do the key derivation above on top of ML-KEM, we’ll hash the ciphertext twice for implicit rejections. That’s ok, because the output of implicit rejection is unpredictable by design, not an interoperation target.</p>

<p>In Berlin there's an old closed airport, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Tempelhof_Airport?ref=words.filippo.io">Tempelhof</a>, which is now a public park. Walking down the taxiways (pictured) or along the centrelines of the 09L/27R and 09R/27L crossed-out runways is kinda unsettling, at least for me. ("Should I be speaking with Ground or Tower? Can I enter this runway?") Fun fact, in 2010 a single-engine plane forgot to switch fuel tank and did an emergency landing on 27L. Closed runways are the best bad places to land, after all.</p>

<h2>The AI Buzz is Boring Now</h2>
<p>I've come to the conclusion that there are four stages to the current AI hype cycle in an individual person's brain, at least as it pertains to large language models.
At the very least, these are the stages I went through.</p>
<h3>Stage One: Amazement</h3>
<p>"Wow! This is so cool! I can converse with a computer just like a real person!"</p>
<p>This is where all the science fiction fantasies come to fruition.
The possibilities seem endless.
We can all kick back and relax now, right?</p>
<h3>Stage Two: Frustration</h3>
<p>"Hmm... This isn't as effective as I originally thought."</p>
<p>It seems like the brand-new technology is really only applicable to the kinds of work no one wants to do anyway.
What it <strong>is</strong> able to do doesn't provide too much value to you.
It gets information and logic wrong often enough that it cannot be trusted for just about anything.</p>
<h3>Stage Three: Confusion</h3>
<p>After stage two, you start to forget about it.
But the hype is inescapable.
Your friends bring it up.
Your parents ask you about it when you go home for the holidays.
Even your dentist tries to extol its virtues.</p>
<p>Even if you moved on it, no one else did.
Could that mean that you were wrong?</p>
<h3>Stage Four: Boredom</h3>
<p>At this point the rate of new language models appearing has become faster than rate of new JavaScript frameworks (and just as annoying).
You want to go back to your roots and start from scratch.
You want the freedom of knowing the whole stack from start to finish.
You don't want any of the ineffective magic.</p>
<p>This is where I am right now.
Want to go back to my roots.
Some people work on old cars, even though they are less efficient.
At the same time though, they are more fun to work on than new cars.
I've decided to look into Markov chains.</p>
<h2>Markov Chains</h2>
<p>Below is a demonstration of my implementation of auto-completion using Markov Chains.</p>
<p>Though it is written in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly, it is not particularly efficient. To find out why, continue down the page to my detailed explanation of the implementation.</p>
<h2>Controls</h2>
<p>You may use either "Choose Word" or your right arrow key [→] to let the system choose the next word. Alternatively, you can tap any of the [Possible Next Words] to do so yourself.</p>

<h2>Explanation</h2>
<p>Markov chains, named after their inventor, Andrey Markov, are often used to model sequences of probabilistic events. That is, systems that cannot be modeled deterministically.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Alice is at the grocery store. For every hour she is there, she has a 70% chance of leaving and going to the planetarium. Conversely, she has a 30% chance of staying.
If Alice is already at the planetarium, she has a 10% chance of leaving and going to the grocery store and a 90% chance of staying.
We can represent these probabilities as a table, where each column belongs to a start location, and each row belongs to a end location:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th></th>
<th></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Start at Grocery Store</td>
<td>Start at Planetarium</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>End at Grocery Store</td>
<td>30%</td>
<td>10%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>End at Planetarium</td>
<td>70%</td>
<td>90%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>If we already know Alice's location for sure, we can simply perform table lookups to predict her most likely next move.
For example, we <em>know</em> she is at the grocery store right now. So by looking at row 2, column 1, we can be 70% confident she will be at the planetarium next hour.
However, this doesn't work if we aren't sure of her location, or we want to predict more than one hour in advance. How do we predict her next move if we aren't certain of her current location?
In the latter case, we might express her current location as another table.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Location</th>
<th>% Alice Present</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Grocery Store</td>
<td>25%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Planetarium</td>
<td>75%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>How do we estimate Alice's location in this new plane of possibility? In particular, how likely will Alice be at the Planetarium next hour?
Since there is a 25% probability Alice is at the grocery store, we multiply that with the probility of her transitioning to the Planetarium: <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>25</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">%</mi><mo>∗</mo><mn>75</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">%</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">25\% * 75\%</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. Next, we add the result with the probability of being at the Planetarium multiplied with the probability of her staying: <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>75</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">%</mi><mo>∗</mo><mn>90</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">%</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">75\% * 90\%</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.

<p>The keen-eyed among you may have noticed that these operations look a lot like matrix multiplication.
Instead of a table, we may represent these possible transitions as a matrix <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">T</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, and the Alice's current location as a vector <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mover accent="true"><mi>s</mi><mo>⃗</mo></mover></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\vec{s}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The location of each element remains the same as the table, even if we aren't explicitly labeling the rows and columns.</p>

<h2>Application to Text-Completion</h2>
<p>The principles above can be applied to a variety of probabilistic situations. Most relavant to this particular webpage, is text completion.
We want to estimate the most likely next word to the user. Given the last word, what are the most likely next words? First, we need a dictionary.</p>
<h3>The Dictionary</h3>
<p>It is trivial to build a dictionary from sample text. For the purposes of the explanation, we are going to start with an arbitrary dictionary.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Index</th>
<th>Word</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>orange</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>fruit</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>passion</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>cheese</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>not</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td>is</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3>Building the Transition Matrix</h3>
<p>To build our transition matrix, we need to count all the transitions that occur between possible words in our dictionary.
In the interest of performance, my implementation converts the dictionary into a <code>HashMap&lt;String, usize&gt;</code>.
Next, I go through the training text and match each word to it's index in the dictionary, effectively transforming the <code>String</code> into a <code>Vec&lt;usize&gt;</code>.
For example, the phrase, "passion fruit is not orange, cheese is orange," becomes, <code>[ 2, 1, 5, 4, 0, 3, 5, 0 ]</code>.
Next, the implementation iterates through each element in this vector, counting each transition. The counts are stored in another <code>HashMap</code> in the interest of performance, but is eventually converted into a matrix <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>C</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">C</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. Each row is the output word's index, and the column is the input word's index.
For example, the transition <code>"fruit" (index 1) -&gt; "is" (index 5)</code> occurs exactly once, so we record <code>1</code> in column 1, row 5.</p>

<p>There are two possible situations: the user is in the process of typing, or they have finished their last word.
The latter is the easiest to implement.
Scan the user's text, and isolate the last word. Perform a lookup on the word list to identify it's index. Create a new vector containing <code>0</code>s except for that index, which should contain a <code>1</code>.
For example, if the last word was 'is',</p>

This is great for autocomplete. We can simply list the most probable options to the user.</p>
<h3>Text-Generation and Steady State</h3>
<p>It would be pretty neat if we could use this method to automagically generate text, right?</p>
<h4>The Naive Solution</h4>
<p>Each iteration, choose the most likely word from the set. Maybe randomize it a bit: choose a random word from the top 5 options.
Unfortunately, there is an issue. All Markov chains are guaranteed to converge on a specific probabilistic state given enough iterations. In order to get text generation to work unpredictably and without converging, we need something a bit more complex.</p>

<p>Investments in fab by TSMC, Bosch, NXP and Infineon are “good for the European car industry but it’s not enough. It’s not enough at all,” says Wennink, “if you want to get to 20%, you just have to calculate how much you need to build here.”</p>

<p>According to SEMI, China will have 8.6 million 8 inch equivalent wpm capacity this year, Taiwan will have 5.7 million wpm, Korea will have 5.1 million wpm, Japan will have 4.7 million wpm, the USA will have 3.1 million wpm, Europe will have 2.7 million wpm, and S.E.Asia will&nbsp;have 1.7 million wpm.</p>
<p>So Europe has roughly 8% of the industry measured by capacity and has roughly 8% of the market measured by value.</p>
<p>To up that to 20% in a world where capacity is currently growing at about 6% a year would need about a dozen new fabs to be built and in full volume production by 2030.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Marlon Brando: Actor, activist… special effects tech geek?<br></p><p>Though the late star was considered by many to be the greatest actor of the 20th century, Brando always had a love-hate relationship with his craft, often remarking that it was a <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2005/03/brando200503" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:silly profession for a grown adult;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">silly profession for a grown adult</a>. He was so frustrated by acting that, in the late 1980s, he embraced a new technology that promised to keep him on the big screen while simultaneously lightening his workload.</p><p>In the new documentary <i>Listen to Me Marlon</i>, director Stevan Riley stitches together intimate home footage that the actor took over the years and combines it with rare interviews to portray Brando as a complicated and volatile soul. But the actor still had a spark for life before his death at age 80 in 2004, and he was fascinated with visual effects, as you can see in this exclusive clip above from the documentary, which you can watch above. The footage was originally intended for an experimental film called <i>Software</i>, which Brando tried to make in the 1990s — more on that later — and features Brando, then in his seventies, delivering a monologue from <i>Macbeth</i>, his face rendered in blue pixels. <br></p><p>The technology in the clip, known as “digital equivalence,” involves creating a photo-realistic digital double of an actor that can look, move, and sound just like the original. It had long been a holy grail of the computer-graphics industry, and when Brando found out about its potential, he partnered with Scott Billups, a veteran cinematographer and graphics pioneer, in the pursuit of perfecting the technology.</p><p>“He dug technology — he was always had the latest system,” Billups, who contributed the footage to the new doc, told Yahoo Movies. “He was always upgraded. He had some new Macs before I did — and I was a Mac developer.”</p><p>The two met in the mid 1970s, but didn’t begin working together in earnest until the late 1980s, when Billups was conducting digital experiments with an actor who lived near Brando’s Hollywood estate (Billups declined to identify the thespian by name). While that neighbor was unnerved by the idea of creating a digital double, Brando eagerly volunteered to be the next test-subject.</p><p>“The friend was freaked, and thought it would kill acting and kill us all and put us out of business, but the test models worked, and you knew who was [on screen]. So Marlon was like, ‘I’m next, I’m next,’” Billups said. They worked closely with Stephen and Lloyd Addleman, brothers who <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=xlP1uoxU1nEC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;lpg=PA14&amp;dq=Stephen+and+Lloyd+Addleman+cyberware&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gEmbqlYhVv&amp;sig=f10haQ9tsaT8n3H14OQnqaXdfUY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwBGoVChMI0YHO2tnYxgIViowNCh3jmgSw#v=onepage&amp;q=Stephen%20and%20Lloyd%20Addleman%20cyberware&amp;f=false" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:invented an early version of the 3D scanner hardware;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">invented an early version of the 3D scanner hardware</a>, which Billups likened to an advanced supermarket grocery scanner and a spinning chair.</p><p>“The concept was for [the actor] to sit in this chair and get really still, and the scanner would go around you in 360 degrees [in] just under a minute,” Billups explained. “Sometimes the scanner would freeze up, so we’d spin the chair. You put somebody like Marlon in a chair and try to get an even spin on him — well, he’s really not the kind of guy who likes to sit still for long.”</p><figure><div><p><img alt="image" src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/4o8McHDwlF0pyFFynGH2yA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTcyMA--/http://40.media.tumblr.com/214f05b1313f97c892af69e1eacfa8bb/tumblr_inline_nrna90Gdb21t2ear7_540.jpg" data-src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/4o8McHDwlF0pyFFynGH2yA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTcyMA--/http://40.media.tumblr.com/214f05b1313f97c892af69e1eacfa8bb/tumblr_inline_nrna90Gdb21t2ear7_540.jpg"></p></div></figure><p><i>Brando, David Addleson and Billups in the late ‘80s (Stephen Addleson) </i></p><p>Billups and Brando wound up doing four different tests of the technology throughout the late ‘80s and early ‘90s; one such test focused on replacing the actor in a film he probably shouldn’t have made anyway. “He was doing <i>Island of Doctor Moreau</i>,” Billups remembered, “and he said he could do half of that script digitally.”</p><p>That 1996 sci-fi movie, which co-starred Val Kilmer, was a notorious bomb, but the digital equivalence tests did lead to the duo working on an even more off-beat project: An adaptation of Rudy Rucker’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Software-Rudy-Rucker/dp/0380701774" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Philip K. Dick Award-winning cyberpunk novel Software;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">Philip K. Dick Award-winning cyberpunk novel <i>Software</i></a>, on which Billups and Brando began pre-production in 1997.</p><p>They set up shop at a company called House of Moves in Santa Monica, building a motion capture studio where they hosted Brando’s A-list friends, including Faye Dunaway. (Dennis Hopper was also attached to the film early on.) “We were scanning them and doing mo-cap — we were going to do this whole movie with digital equivalents,” Billups said. “You could do a movie with a week’s worth of work instead of sitting on set bored out of their minds for a couple months.”</p><p>Billups’ version of <i>Software</i> ultimately fell apart due to disagreements with producers and financiers; it was awfully expensive to attempt to make a film with such an ambitious and risky technology.</p><p>In the photo above, you can see Brando sitting in the lab. Below, we have scans of some of the early tests that Billups and Brando did together; the actor was required to speak — with exaggerated expression —every vowel and syllable, so that they could later generate a fully digital character that made the same exact facial movements. The result is found in the video at the top of this story.</p><figure><div><p><img alt="image" src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/deXKktli0lzDktsXE.kCGw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTkyMQ--/http://40.media.tumblr.com/1a54a4f0aa630d8c7b90b9455b5cfe98/tumblr_inline_nrna90lH0f1t2ear7_540.jpg" data-src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/deXKktli0lzDktsXE.kCGw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTkyMQ--/http://40.media.tumblr.com/1a54a4f0aa630d8c7b90b9455b5cfe98/tumblr_inline_nrna90lH0f1t2ear7_540.jpg"></p></div></figure><p><i>Some early scans of Brando’s face</i></p><p>The collapse of <i>Software</i> didn’t sink the actor’s intense interest in technology; as the new century dawned, he pursued not just high-grade experimental electronics, but consumer-level tech, as well.<br></p><p>“Marlon was a closet geek. Well, not even in the closet — he was big into it,” Billups explained. “He was an ace with Photoshop. He would take people’s pictures and put them in places they never were. He’d say, ‘Remember when we were in so-and-so?’ and you’d see people trying to remember that situation.”</p><p>The trick to successfully confusing his friends, Billups explained, was being subtle about it. “He would maneuver it so wasn’t totally unbelievable; he would create an alternate reality,” Billups remembered. “He’d say, ‘I’ve got a picture of it right here, you’re looking at a picture of you at the Statue of Liberty.’ He would do this to all kinds of people, it was hilarious.”</p><p>Brando invested heavily in his hardware, always going after the latest computer systems — often owning them before Billups, who still makes his living in the visual effects industry. The actor was even an early user of CoSa After Effects, the post-production program used for green screen and other effects work, which was eventually sold to Adobe.</p><p>Billups remembers Brando first talking about potentially using motion capture and digital equivalence to perform his role as Jor-El in the original <i>Superman</i> movie, which came out in 1978. It’s taken almost 40 years for effects artists and engineers to realize the technology he was pursuing; this summer, audiences will see aged-down versions of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Michael Douglas in <i>Terminator Genisys</i> and <i>Ant-Man</i>, respectively. The tech isn’t perfect yet, but the facial scan used in those two blockbusters is a tremendous leap forward from where it was when Brando died in 2004.</p><p>In general, Brando would have loved how far technology has come, and it’s easy to imagine the actor being enamored with social media. Brando was a fan of the <i>Myst</i> PC game franchise, and was active in early forms of social media.</p><p>“He loved the anonymity of the web and ability to interact with people outside of his skin,” Billups recalled. “His online persona was that of Chinese exchange student and he handled it masterfully. Not in any skeezy way, but he could pull things out of people that might not have realized of themselves. He was quite masterful at this.”<br></p><p>His email address was just as curious: Brando went by the name BrainFlakes.</p><p>“He was the cleverest son of a bitch you’d ever met,” Billups added. “He was a really sweet guy.”</p><p><i>Listen to Me Marlon</i> will be released at New York’s Film Forum on July 29, LA’s Landmark Theater on July 31, and rollout nationwide after that. It will also air on Showtime in the fall.</p></div></div>]]></description>

I can type in every letter, except Ś. When I press the key for Ś, the letter just doesn’t appear. It only happens on Medium.”</p></blockquote><p id="0e14">This was odd. We don’t really special-case any language in any way, and even if we did… out of 32 Polish characters, why would <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9A" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">this random one</a> be the only one causing problems?</p><p id="8b8e">Turns out, it wasn’t so random. This is a story of how four incidental ingredients spanning decades (if not centuries) came together to cause the most curious of bugs, and how we fixed it.</p></div><div><div><h2 id="8871">Ingredient 1 of 4:<br>Polish language</h2><p id="522f">Polish is the second most-used Slavic language, right after Russian, and before Ukrainian. Contrary to those two, however, and similar to Western European languages such as German or French, Polish uses the English/Latin alphabet with a few customizations.</p><p id="0578">This is the base English alphabet, largely the same as a classic Latin/Roman alphabet:</p></div><div><p id="3710">Original Polish words never contain Q, V or X, although we keep them for Latin and other borrowed words:</p></div><div><p id="775a">In exchange for those three, however, Polish adds nine additional diacritics using Latin characters as their base, all in relatively common use:</p></div></div><div><div><p id="203f">Starting in the early 20th century, typewriters needed to accommodate the extra 9 letters. If you compare an American typewriter with a Polish one:</p></div><div><p id="0ac7">…and look at the right side of the keyboard, you can see two of the diacritics — Ł and Ż — promoted to separate keys, and the rest sharing keys with other symbols. (Typists were encouraged to assemble uppercase versions of seven remaining letters by typing a Latin character, backspacing, and then overwriting an accent to “simulate” the proper letter. This was not uncommon during typewriter times.)</p><p id="ecf2">To find room for the extra letters, typewriters needed to dispense with some punctuation, most notably semicolons (comma + backspace + colon), and parentheses (replaced in common use by slashes).</p></div></div><div><div><h2 id="046c">Ingredient 2 of 4:<br>Communism</h2><p id="3e4f">For someone interested in the early personal computing in the 1980s, Communism in Poland meant a few things:</p><ul><li id="ead6">not a lot of disposable income,</li><li id="ba67">forbidden commercial importing of computers from the West (individual importing was still possible, assuming you had enough foreign currency and some means of acquiring it).</li></ul><p id="c94b">I grew up in Poland. My first computer — the glorious Atari 800XL—was an original 1979 technology, repackaged in 1983. We got it in 1986. Used.</p><p id="d229">This wasn’t uncommon. Technology was delayed on that side of the Iron Curtain; most computers were imported from the West. Prohibited commercial importing meant that for the longest time there was no commercial entity that could prepare computers for use in Poland. Foreign computers arrived with original instructions, untranslated software, and American keyboards like this one:</p></div><div><p id="783f">While France, Germany, and other countries got their early PCs with customized keyboards whose layouts mirrored closely the typewriters that came before…</p></div><div><figure></figure><figure><figcaption>Early IBM PC keyboards with French AZERTY and German QWERTZ layouts</figcaption></figure></div><div><p id="14cb">…in Poland, we had to find another way of inputting the extra 9 diacritics unique to our language.</p><p id="7fcd">Our extra characters might look very much like Latin equivalents, and amount to only about 8% of letter distribution (you will <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrabble_letter_distributions#Polish" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">hate them playing Scrabble</a>), but they are important. You can’t just swap them around. Consider these two similar words:</p><figure></figure><p id="fff6">Perfectly interchangeable, right? Well, not quite:</p><figure></figure><p id="22ea">There are more examples like that. As it happens, in those early PC days, I was happy that my full name, Marcin Kazimierz Wichary, did not come with any diacritics… and used to make fun of some of my less “lucky” friends. I was a mean nerd.</p><p id="9bae">Surely, there’s something that can be done, though? Back to the keyboard:</p></div><div><p id="1818">We cannot modify it in any way since that’d require messing with hardware, but we can still try to find a clever solution. There are two modifier keys — Ctrl (where today’s Caps Lock is), and Alt. Ctrl was already used as a common shortcut key, even before Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V became typical for copy and paste. But Alt was relatively uncommon. And thus, a <em>de facto</em> standard was born, assigning each of our diacritics to its Latin counterpart:</p></div><div><p id="7516">People started calling the older layout <em>typist’s keyboard layout, </em>and the new invention <em>programmer’s layout, </em>either because early PC users were mostly programmers, or because it preserved all the punctuation symbols that were often used in programming.</p><p id="45dc">The new layout was an ergonomic nightmare — look at how many of those letters are very close to the Left Alt and need to be pressed using the same hand — but it was easy to understand and did not require any expensive hardware modifications or even cheap ones (for example stickers). It stuck. A few other nearby countries (Romania, then-Czechoslovakia) came up with similar schemes.</p><p id="faf7">The setup was so successful that even when, a decade later, proper typist’s keyboards started appearing, practically no one would switch to them, mirroring the ascendancy of the inferior QWERTY some 80 years before.</p></div><div><figure></figure><figure><figcaption>Contemporary typist’s layout vs. contemporary programmer’s layout (or, American keyboard)</figcaption></figure></div></div><div><h2 id="a94a">Ingredient 3 of 4:<br>Old habits dying hard</h2><p id="2add">Autosaving, common today, needed to wait for the right moment. Especially in the 1980s, and even 1990s, saving your document was lengthy (powering up that floppy drive and writing to the disk took some time), would slowly wear out whatever medium you were using, and sometimes occupy CPU so much it couldn’t be used for anything else.</p><p id="b182">Saving by hand was then what backing up is today: a habit you needed to learn for your own good. The unlucky ones figured it out the hard way, writing for hours on a computer that had a tendency to crash cruelly and often, only to realize <em>they never saved what you were typing.</em></p><p id="630d">I was one of them. And we all learned to press Command+S or Ctrl+S whenever we paused for breath. Sometimes it was after every chapter. Often, every paragraph. Later on, even a sentence. Ctrl+S became a keystroke buried in people’s muscle memory, a habit that was an intrinsic part of writing.</p><figure></figure></div><div><div><p id="65c1">Then that habit turned on them. If you write in any Web-based editor, the default thing that happens after pressing the save key combination, is a browser window — giving you a completely useless option to save the current website’s HTML code, often announcing itself <em>via</em> a slow, annoying animation.</p><p id="cac9">The same was true for Medium, a long time ago:</p><figure></figure><p id="b8e6">However, at some point we added a little bit of code to our editor to make the save dialog go away:</p></div><div><p id="cd7d">It translates to: if S happens to be pressed with Command (<em>metaKey,</em> used by Macintoshes) or Ctrl (used by Windows or Linux PCs), first: prompt our editor to save what it’s doing (even though we’d autosave it soon anyway), and second: prevent anything else that would normally happen… in this case the annoying browser save dialog.</p><p id="ab9b">Which is the right thing to do. (You can still get to the save dialog from the menu, if you want.)</p></div></div><div><p id="7ac5">Now, this should ring all sorts of alarms in your head if you remember the bug report mentioned at the beginning:</p><blockquote><p id="97bc">“I just started an article in Polish. I can type in every letter, except Ś. When I press the key for Ś, the letter just doesn’t appear. It only happens on Medium.”</p></blockquote><p id="a3e8">Something doesn’t compute, though. Medium is blocking Command+S and Ctrl+S, but you get to Ś by keying in… Alt+S.</p><p id="4791">For these two worlds to collide, we need just one more ingredient.</p></div><div><div><h2 id="ca46">Ingredient 4 of 4:<br>Microsoft Windows</h2><p id="a774">Both Windows 3.x and 95 had terrific keyboard support. The menu items and dialogs had controls that could be accessed easily by mouse… but also much quicker by pressing Alt and the underlined letter:</p><figure></figure><p id="8110">Most of Microsoft Windows UI could be turned into a sequence of keyboard shortcuts, which was incredibly powerful (and something Mac could still learn from). In Poland, however, Alt was already commonly used to enter the extra diacritics. That presented a conflict.</p><p id="2f52">Fortunately, by then, keyboards evolved to have extra modifier keys, including a secondary Alt key on the other side of the spacebar.</p></div><div><p id="9843">So, what if we kept the Left Alt key for Windows shortcuts, but used the Right Alt key for Polish diacritics? That would solve all the problems (although the short-lived victory of better ergonomics through two modifier keys would be nullified again… this time one-handed Right Alt+O, Right Alt+L, and Right Alt+N being RSI fodder).</p></div><div><p id="1263">For reasons having to do with the older keyboards without the Right Alt (and more modern notebook keyboards that might skip that key for space reasons), Right Alt in Windows was internally mapped as a rarely-used combination of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2004/03/29/101121.aspx" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Ctrl and Alt pressed together</a>.</p><p id="9337">Which meant that, from the system perspective, all of the above shortcuts looked like this:</p></div><div><p id="e455">And there’s something oddly uncomfortable with this picture. That Ctrl+Alt+S is starting to look very familiar now, doesn’t it? In fact, <em>incredibly </em>familiar to Ctrl+S that we once started blocking to improve saving.</p></div></div><div><h2 id="e9ca">The fix</h2><p id="ba7b">Putting all of this together, the reason for the bug becomes obvious:</p><ol><li id="948b">Through historical circumstance, people in Poland use Right Alt+S to type in Ś.</li><li id="c701">Because of an obscure technical decision, Right Alt+S is mapped internally to Ctrl+Alt+S.</li><li id="e29a">Through habit, people might occasionally want to press Ctrl+S to save a document.</li><li id="da41">Medium was overriding whatever default action happened when you pressed Ctrl+S, thinking it’s just a browser save dialog it was canceling… and never realizing it could be something else: <em>a letter Ś.</em></li></ol><p id="c739">And so, typing Ś became impossible.</p></div><div><div><p id="9108">Once I figured it out, the patch was trivial. Instead of blindly blocking Ctrl+S, we could block Ctrl+S <em>only if Alt key was not pressed.</em></p></div><div><p id="b501">We fixed this last week, and it wasn’t a lot of work. After seeing the Medium bug reports filed in, and having remembered once asking to change what happens when you press Ctrl+S, I figured it out without much trouble.</p><p id="d9a0">But I happen to be Polish, and I went through all of the above — learning to touch type on my mom’s typewriter, owning early PCs with American keyboards, rewiring my muscle memory for the Left Alt first, and the Right Alt second… and in the same muscle memory, putting Ctrl+S early on, and then replacing it with Command+S as I switched to Macs.</p><p id="cab3">Much has changed in Poland since the 1980s. In 1989, Communism fell. Computers are now imported legally by individuals and companies alike. Today’s Windows and Mac machines in Poland are bought new, fully support Polish, and the operating systems themselves are properly localized. If you open up system preferences, though, you will still see the programmer’s layout there, and it’s still the most commonly used of the two.</p><figure></figure></div></div><div><p id="746d">The few lines of code above might be, to me, one of the most curious in Medium’s codebase, the result of an arbitrary set of circumstances… today copiously commented so that people coming after me understand the one opaque conditional statement.</p><p id="63d7">As we see Medium being used in more and more countries, we will be dealing with those kind of thick, arbitrary internationalization and localization issues over and over again. With a big exception, though: no one will be there to give us a backstory, to unfold the opaque, to explain any of this to us the way I could explain the above.</p><p id="3a32">This bug is a harbinger of very scary, and very exciting times.</p></div><div><p id="e25a"><em>If you’ve read so far, maybe you want to help us out here at Medium? We’re looking for ambassadors in different countries — people knowing their language, caring about typography, wanting stories on Medium to look and behave most properly for where they are.</em></p><p id="5fb2"><em>Let us know at </em><a href="mailto:languages@medium.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>languages@medium.com</em></a><em>.

<h2>Why is KOSA a bad bill?</h2>



<p>KOSA uses two methods to “protect” kids, and both of them are awful. </p>



<p>First, KOSA would pressure platforms to install filters that would wipe the net of anything deemed “inappropriate” for minors. This = instructing platforms to censor, plain and simple. Places that already use content filters <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/education/article/Katy-ISD-blocks-LGBTQ-resources-suicide-16647274.php">have restricted</a> important information about suicide prevention and LGBTQ+ support groups, and KOSA <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/03/kids-online-safety-act-heavy-handed-plan-force-platforms-spy-young-people">would spread</a> this kind of censorship to every corner of the internet. It’s no surprise that anti-rights zealots are excited about KOSA: it would let them shut down websites that cover topics like race, gender, and sexuality.</p>



<p>Second, KOSA would ramp up the online surveillance of all internet users by expanding the use of age verification and parental monitoring tools. Not only are these tools needlessly invasive, they’re a massive safety risk for young people who could be trying to escape domestic violence and abuse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dozens of LGBTQ+ and civil rights groups agree that KOSA is dangerous and updates to the 2023 version won’t and can’t address the big problems with the bill.<strong>&nbsp;If you believe in a free and open internet, send a message to your lawmakers right now and tell them to reject KOSA!</strong></p>
