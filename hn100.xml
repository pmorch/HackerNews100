    <section id="what-is-hpy"><h2>What is HPy?<a href="#what-is-hpy" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>HPy provides a new API for extending Python in C.  In other words, you use
<code>#include &lt;hpy.h&gt;</code> instead of <code>#include &lt;Python.h&gt;</code>.</p>
</section><section id="what-are-the-advantages-of-hpy"><h2>What are the advantages of HPy?<a href="#what-are-the-advantages-of-hpy" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Zero overhead</strong> on CPython: extensions written in HPy run at the same
speed as "normal" extensions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Much faster</strong> on alternative implementations such as <a href="https://pypy.org/">PyPy</a>, <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/python">GraalPy</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Universal binaries</strong>: extensions built for the <a href="https://docs.hpyproject.org/en/latest/overview.html#target-abis">HPy Universal ABI</a> can be
loaded unmodified on CPython, PyPy, GraalPython, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A migration path</strong> for mixing legacy C-API calls with HPy API calls. Once
all the code is migrated, the extension can be compiled as a universal binary
that works on any CPython version, PyPy, or GraalPy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Debug mode</strong>: in <a href="https://docs.hpyproject.org/en/latest/debug-mode.html">debug mode</a>, you can easily identify common problems such
as memory leaks, invalid lifetime of objects, invalid usage of APIs. Have
you ever forgot a <code>Py_INCREF</code> or <code>Py_DECREF</code>? The HPy debug mode can be
activated at runtime to detect these mistakes for you on universal binaries.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Nicer API</strong>: the standard Python/C API shows its age. HPy is designed to
overcome some of its limitations, be more consistent, produce better quality
extensions and to make it harder to introduce bugs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Evolvability</strong>: As nicely summarized in
<a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0620/">PEP 620</a> the standard Python/C API
exposes a lot of internal implementation details which makes it hard to
evolve the C API. HPy doesn't have this problem because all internal
implementation details are hidden.</p></li>
</ul></section><section id="current-status"><h2>Current status<a href="#current-status" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>HPy is under active development. <a href="https://hpyproject.org/blog/posts/2023/10/hpy-0.9.0-fourth-public-release/">0.9.0</a> is the latest alpha release but we
will soon leave the _alpha_ state and are working hard towards a stable release.</p>
<p>We feel that the HPy ABI is stable enough now that we can fulfill our backwards
and forwards binary compatibility promises with the upcoming release, and that
the API now covers enough use cases to migrate important packages (in
particular, checkout our <a href="https://github.com/hpyproject/numpy-hpy/tree/graal-team/hpy#readme">numpy</a> port). We also provide porting guides and
extensive documentation (in particular the <a href="https://docs.hpyproject.org/en/latest/api-reference/index.html">API reference</a>).</p>
<p>We are, of course, always open for design discussions and new reqiurements.</p>
<p>The Python/C API is huge. At the moment many popular functions are
available. Is something missing for the port of your favorite extension?
Please open an issue or even better a PR.</p>
<section id="hpy-compatible-extensions"><h3>HPy-compatible extensions<a href="#hpy-compatible-extensions" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The extensions that we are experimenting with include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/hpyproject/ultrajson-hpy">ultrajson-hpy</a>: this was the first real-world module to be ported to HPy. It is
a nice fit because it only exports functions (as opposed as custom types)
and requires only a small number of API functions.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/hpyproject/piconumpy">piconumpy</a>: as the name suggests, this is a minimal numpy-like module which
defines a custom type (similar to <code>ndarray</code> but with many fewer features of
course).</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/hpyproject/numpy-hpy/tree/graal-team/hpy#readme">numpy</a>: one of our ambitious goals is to port numpy to HPy, and to use this
experience to better understand how to design the API. This port is close to
passing the test suite.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/hpyproject/matplotlib-hpy/">matplotlib</a>: Since Matplotlib also has a dependency to NumPy, the migration
to universal mode is not fully finished. HPy provides the legacy compatibility API
such that we can still call legacy C API functions from HPy and successfully
run the test suite.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/hpyproject/kiwi-hpy/">kiwi-solver</a>: A dependency of Matplotlib, it has been fully ported to
universal mode.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Benchmarks and more information about the Matplotlib and kiwi-solver ports can
be found in the <a href="https://medium.com/graalvm/porting-matplotlib-from-c-api-to-hpy-aa32faa1f0b5">GraalVM blog post</a>. The benchmarks show that the HPy ports
have little impact on CPython performance, while enabling close-to-cpython
performance with GraalVM Python for the kiwi-solver complete HPy port.</p>
</section></section><section id="where-we-need-help"><h2>Where we need help<a href="#where-we-need-help" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Documentation:</strong> Our resources are very limited and we therefore concentrate
on technical tasks. We already wrote a significant amount of documentation
(see <a href="https://hpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Documentation</a>) but it is not complete yet. If this non-coding work is
something you can do, let us know.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Publicity:</strong> HPy is already well received among core developers of some
important projects. For instance, we are actively talking to Python, NumPy,
and Cython core developers. However, we need to get more package developers to
be interested in and even use HPy. We appreciate any help for advertising HPy
and we are also happy to help preparing talks, demos, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tooling:</strong> This is also a topic we would need help. We are, for example,
thinking of migration helper tools that do all the boilerplate work that can
be automated when migrating a package from C API to HPy API.</p></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Packaging:</strong> There are several open questions we need to discuss and answer.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How to package a universal extension and how to put it on PyPI?</p></li>
<li><p>How best to package HPy itself</p></li>
<li><p>How does HPy integrate with setuptools, mesonpy, or other build systems</p></li>
<li><p>Upstreaming completed forks of the packages listed below, or upstreaming
parts of the forks so the code does not suffer from bit-rot</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Website and logo design:</strong> You don't like this website and the HPy logo?
Well, we have expertise in virtual machines, compilers, low-level programming,
etc, but zero expertise in web development or graphic design. <a href="https://github.com/hpyproject/hpyproject.org/">PRs are welcome

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We're in an age where Apple and Google have a near-monopoly over smartphone software. LineageOS and Android modding is dying. We all hate Big Tech monopolies, Google isn't the cool company it once was, Google is showing their true colors. Yet we let them rule our phones and didn't fight back. We <em>need</em> a real GNU/Linux smartphone ecosystem.</p>

<p>Why hasn't the PC ecosystem locked out Linux? Because Linux is too powerful that nobody can really fight it. We fought against Microsoft's monopoly and even if we don't have the Year of the Desktop Linux, we still have access. But why can <a href="https://github.com/melontini/bootloader-unlock-wall-of-shame">phone OEMs take back bootloader unlocking</a>? Because LineageOS isn't powerful enough. OEMs, developers and carriers give the middle finger and got us locked out.</p>

<p>LineageOS has a big flaw: it's dependent on Google. Verizon and banks are much more powerful than modders, so much that if they hate Android modding they both can force us to use stock firmware. Whereas Verizon and banks won't block you from using desktop Linux. It's also the fault of the modding community for not fighting back hard enough the way the GNU/Linux community fought the Microsoft monoculture.</p>

<p>For instance, Chase claims to "require" Windows or Mac but doesn't block Linux. Why? Because Linux is too powerful for Chase. Whereas Chase has blocked modded Android for years if you aren't into a cocktail of Magisk modules. One day, that won't work. I've given up on custom ROMs because of a declining ROM ecosystem, and even I'm not too happy about giving OEMs control over my phone.</p>

<p>While a GNU/Linux smartphone will lack apps, if the US wins their lawsuit against Apple we could push for Progressive Web Apps to make most mobile apps OS-agnostic and leave native apps for games. Heck, Waydroid would be <em>perfect</em> for a GNU/Linux phone: get the Android apps you need in a container.</p>

<p>Why can desktop Linux and Chromebooks not be niche platforms a la BeOS or AmigaOS? Because many desktop use cases went web so they're truly OS agnostic, aside from rouge developers. And even a user agent switcher can work in most cases. Yes, there's still Word and Photoshop and Autodesk, but enough people don't need them also.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-3419622014212783578" itemprop="description articleBody"><p>
If you've been wondering why entries have been a little slow lately, let me tell you a story.
</p><p>
All collectors tend to be a bit obsessive by nature, and us classic computer nerds probably pick up more hardware than we can (or should) store in our residence — especially if the loves of our lives aren't as enthusiastic about the hobby than we are — and thus have storage units for the overflow. I have two small "cold" climate control units, kept small so that I can be out of one or both relatively quickly, as well as a larger "hot" conventional unit at ambient temperature. The hot unit is indoors and not exposed directly to the sun, so it's not particularly hot for sunny southern California, but I keep working spare electronics, hard disks, tapes, etc. in the cold units as a precaution and use the hot unit for non-working parts units, books, magazines and other household items.
</p><p>
Of course, climate control units cost more, sometimes substantially, and thieves use this as a signal that more valuable stuff is likely to be kept there:
</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjO90CaD60O5BfZNhnsywtYKkepciLhXROdFXqd8aOcTOmRGugQ1FEZRTHp4GoDIVVJbk1doJvEa0XTCo7TVaHloP0k7jTJjCAjKZV7dq7k_A6P-j6o9BCpO5o11CRJZ-UhkeVclowFKRVKHxMtIdMCdToTlM2ZLJLZrz9ljAQKY2mzPqIjgSI_zXWvP0k/s4080/PXL_20240806_164239071.jpg"><img alt="" data-original-height="4080" data-original-width="3072" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjO90CaD60O5BfZNhnsywtYKkepciLhXROdFXqd8aOcTOmRGugQ1FEZRTHp4GoDIVVJbk1doJvEa0XTCo7TVaHloP0k7jTJjCAjKZV7dq7k_A6P-j6o9BCpO5o11CRJZ-UhkeVclowFKRVKHxMtIdMCdToTlM2ZLJLZrz9ljAQKY2mzPqIjgSI_zXWvP0k/s320/PXL_20240806_164239071.jpg"></a></p><p>
Both times I've been burglarized, they were the cold units. August was the second time. So, with crime being a nationwide topic, let's talk about what happens when your storage unit gets broken into and how to recover from it.
</p><p>
<a name="more"></a>
The first time was not quite two decades ago at a now defunct national chain. I was obviously rather younger then and didn't recognize that these units were incredibly poorly secured: they had simple plywood doors that opened out as opposed to metal roll-ups, the "latch" (such as it was) was just a regular safety hasp your padlock went on, and the door hinges were completely exposed. The exterior door to the climate control units (because there must be one to keep the climate controlled air in) was a regular unlocked door without any security cameras. According to the police, a couple of tweekers decided to use the climate units as free air conditioned apartments and intermittently took up residence in many of them, including mine. I had the good sense to use a disc lock instead of a regular padlock, but while they may have been drug-addled they turned out to be smarter than I was. Instead of attacking the lock they just pulled the hinge pins (only two) and got in without even touching the door, the lock or the hasp, and then were able to pull the door closed and escape discovery on walkthrus. By moving around they apparently weren't noticed for days.
</p><p>
When a storage unit is hit, the police report that the facility files and any insurance claim they make are completely separate from yours. They may or may not use information from you, but you still have to file your own. During their vacation in my two units they stole and likely hocked my family's Panasonic VHS video camera, which didn't have any tapes we cared about but would have been fun to keep, as well as my first digital camera, an Olympus Camedia something or other that used SmartMedia and still had some photos on it I realized later I never downloaded, a Fisher-Price PXL2000 (the famous pixelicious video camera that uses regular audio cassettes instead of videotape) I had in its original box that I got to use exactly once, and my spare boxed Mattel Intellivision. They also stole a few items from my highway signs collection and even spray-painted a couple I suppose for lulz, and generously left some rather grotty drug paraphernalia and dirty blankets in trade which the police took as evidence.
</p><p>
Only one of those items was recovered, the Intellivision (the one item I cared about <em>least</em> since that was a totally spare unit). It turned up at a pawn shop on the other side of the freeway. California law, at least at that time, said that the pawn shop had to be reimbursed what they paid: they couldn't sell it to you at retail, but they also were to be made whole. I went over with someone from the police department and I think it cost me $60 to recover it; I still have it. The cop also quietly pointed out all the things that were wrong with the storage units and told me to get out the rest of my stuff and leave at my earliest opportunity since they would almost certainly be hit again.
</p><p>
But what about making <em>me</em> whole? I was required to have insurance on the units, but I just had an apartment at the time and didn't carry renter's insurance, so I paid a premium as part of my rental fees to the chain's "insurance partner." If this smells like a kickback deal, you're right, and virtually every self-storage company engages in it. The idea is to offer you something cheap so that the insurance company will then protect the storage company by deflecting claims. The insurance is cheap because it sucks. I had a police report, obviously, but when I tried to submit the claims for each unit — on paper, as we did in the Dark Ages at the beginning of the 21st century — they were rejected for insufficient documentation (because who keeps a receipt for the Intellivision you bought five years ago from a thrift store?) and I was hardly in a position to sue them over it.
</p><p>
As the cop instructed, I bailed out of there a couple months later. The doors had not been upgraded, there was still no lock on the exterior entrance, and the manager said installing cameras would be too expensive. I made sure to note on my "exit survey" that I was leaving because their security was worse than a Russian garrison after a vodka waffle party. The chain subsequently folded and got sold to some other megastorage company and I imagine they're still too cheap to do anything about it.
</p><p>
The current break-in was a bit more professional because the facility I moved to was obviously more serious about security (they could hardly have been less). When I first moved in, the climate control section had proper roll-up doors and sliding security latches, and there were cameras scattered around the premises, but the exterior door was also just a regular door and usually left unlocked. One of the local unhoused encampments noticed this and moved in, leaving a mess and requiring forcible eviction by the police, though they didn't manage to get into any occupied units. After that the management installed a cipher lock-type door handle and issued unique codes to each tenant.
</p><p>
We own a house now, but my particular homeowner's insurance policy doesn't cover rental units (I read every page, believe me). Even though the "partner" insurance was useless the first time around, I still went with the company this facility was getting kickbacks from since it was the cheapest alternative. After all, I figured if I got hit again they wouldn't pay off this time either, so I might as well spend as little money as possible on it.
</p><p>
The door handle only controlled the latch; there was no deadbolt. So what do you do to attack a door like that? You crowbar it and pry the latch open (see also <a href="https://xkcd.com/538/">the well-known xkcd</a>). The picture at the beginning was what it looked like when I came to survey the damage. The manager had effected some emergency repairs and installed a temporary keyed deadbolt, requiring me to go to the office to get inside.
</p><p>
And what do you do to attack disc locks? Well, if you're not handy with a pick, you drill them.
</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj2aKtVbiekkhiD5SeCwyV4p_wQNZ2RiiGy7tMIZYMs_vhorPEA5ocSxuGC-gf0uZvgo4J4UGdHiEd2mJmP4HXebuKBx_TlM_fopUkbWIuhWStqUFTytfygTMTbwOwgwWQJZJyOh6nyyQwzjGAKoYi0sMDM5u7w6edG6gIHZkoWqowMKJR5ylkDK_SZWWQ/s4080/PXL_20240806_234051528~2.jpg"><img alt="" data-original-height="3072" data-original-width="4080" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj2aKtVbiekkhiD5SeCwyV4p_wQNZ2RiiGy7tMIZYMs_vhorPEA5ocSxuGC-gf0uZvgo4J4UGdHiEd2mJmP4HXebuKBx_TlM_fopUkbWIuhWStqUFTytfygTMTbwOwgwWQJZJyOh6nyyQwzjGAKoYi0sMDM5u7w6edG6gIHZkoWqowMKJR5ylkDK_SZWWQ/s320/PXL_20240806_234051528~2.jpg" width="320"></a></p><p>
The drilled lock is on the right where you can see the small hole in the keyway. This lock was on the first unit, in which they upended several items and ended up stealing my Atari Portfolio in a camera bag (the good one, of course, not the flaky spare), a boxed set of Agenda VR3 PDAs (the famous MIPS Linux-based one), and an 867MHz Titanium PowerBook G4 in its original box. This unit was somewhat defective in that it has an iffy LCD CCFL that starts up pink. Later after submitting the claim and police report I also noticed they stole a box of Apple Pro Speakers (wait until they try to hook them up to anything).
</p><p>
For some reason they didn't drill the lock on the second unit and instead took several whacks at it with some sort of sharp instrument, but this only made the lock completely inoperable. They then pried the latch off, but the shelves in that unit interfere with the roll-up door unless you know the trick and they apparently weren't able to get inside. (The manager had also replaced the latch before I arrived.) In the process, however, they did succeed in knocking some items around including a couple of hard disks off the shelf from my Outbound laptop systems. They were fortunately backed up before storage and should be replaceable with some other 2.5" IDE equivalent device because they won't spin up now.
</p><p>
Having learned my lesson from the first burglary, I had nothing irreplaceable in the units, though I did have some items from my Tomy Pyuuta collection in the second one temporarily. They also didn't go through any boxes, likely because they didn't have any time: the next scheduled security patrol arrived about ten or fifteen minutes after they gained access and discovered the theft, so no doubt they hauldassed when they saw the guard coming back on rounds. I also wasn't the only person burglarized, though the manager wouldn't tell me exactly how many other units were hit. For the units that were hit, he provided us with covers that slide onto the latch:

I can see how this would make it very difficult to use boltcutters or an angle grinder on the lock shackle, but if you can get a key in it, you can get a wrench or a drill bit in it, so I'm not sure if it adds any meaningful security otherwise. I wandered around to see if the covers were on other units and I counted a few, though I couldn't say if everyone who got one was using it.
</p><p>
This time, same city, the police never showed for my units and I don't know if they came to the premises at all. (Before you ask, I have absolutely no idea if <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_California_Proposition_47">Proposition 47</a> has anything to do with it.) I submitted the police reports online and got my case numbers, one for each unit as usual, and then did an online submission with the insurance company including the photos that I had.
</p><p>
The insurance company took about a week to assign an adjuster. Despite having itemized the missing items twice on the police report and in the initial submission, I was asked to complete <em>and notarize</em> another inventory sheet for each unit <em>on paper</em>. The adjuster also wanted any proof of purchase or ownership, such as "a receipt, invoice, order or shipping confirmation, or debit/credit statement." Naturally, these items are so old and have been in there so long that none of this exists. The situation sounded suspiciously like I was going to get stiffed again and I complained to the adjuster that if I had to pay a notary to notarize two documents that may never result in a payout, I'd be out even more money as well as time. (A fairly cynical way of discouraging claims by people for whom that amount of money is more significant.)
</p><p>
To my surprise, although it took several E-mails and another ten days, the adjuster agreed to waive the notarization requirement. (I'm not even sure what the notarization step was accomplishing: the inventory sheets aren't affidavits.) The documents wanted purchase price and location, which I could only do from memory, and a replacement cost, which I did by eBay searches for comparable items. My insurance limit is $2,000 each unit with a $100 deductible, waived if you have a disc lock installed, which I did. I made sure the destroyed disc locks were listed as part of the claim and I determined a total replacement cost of $512.23 in the first unit and $57.23 in the second one.
</p><p>
I didn't hear anything for a month and E-mailed the adjuster again. The next day they paid off on the claim: $269.40 and $48.96. "The policy you have is based on the Actual Cash Value (ACV) of your items, which means depreciation needs to be applied to the item(s) based on their age. I've adjusted the loss presented and added in the applicable sales tax." Since I figured the alternative was $0 and extra vitriol for this blog post, I agreed. The checks arrived this week and we deposited them. They do not make me whole, though of course none of these items are critical.
</p><p>
Here's the lessons learned for those of us with classic computers in storage:
</p><ul>
<li>The quality of the facility's security matters. The best burglary is the one that never happens. If one does, higher quality facilities are more likely to work with less unreasonable partner insurance agencies.
</li><li>Store nothing you really care about in a storage unit. Real burglars notwithstanding, the other kind of theft you may have to worry about is an unscrupulous manager who says you didn't pay your bill and auctions it off. Such horror stories aren't common, but I know people who say this has happened to them, keeping in mind I'm only hearing their side of the story. For example, <a href="http://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2024/03/after-41-years-my-first-assembly.html">my original Tomy Tutor</a>, the actual computer I got when I was seven in its actual box with its actual accessories that actually still works, will never go in storage. Neither will my first suitcase Commodore KIM-1.
</li><li><em>Use a disc lock.</em> They're certainly better than the cheapo padlocks you buy at the store, but most insurance companies will also reduce or waive your deductable if you have what they consider to be a proper lock, and that usually means a disc lock. If you use the disc lock the storage facility sells, you'll likely pay an additional markup on it, but it's also guaranteed to be acceptable to their partner insurance company. Plus, you can claim the replacement cost.
</li><li>How you do inventory may not have much effect on the success of your claim. The advice that you should take photos of your storage unit each time you're in it is a good one and you might as well do it if you have the presence of mind, but it's not really what they're asking for on claims ("you could have lost it, you could have misplaced it, that's not proof of ownership," etc.), and there's no guarantee you'll have photographed what in fact got taken. A beautiful spreadsheet doesn't prove ownership either. In both cases they wanted receipts and I didn't have any of those. In the first case, the insurance company told me to pound sand. In the second case, they paid off. I'll let you know if a pattern ever emerges, but the photos didn't have anything to do with it in either situation.
</li><li>Bulky and heavy items are ignored. Fortunately, many classic computing items are bulky and heavy, and they take up space in a truck. If it's going to slow them down and it's not clear they can fence it, they might damage it but they probably won't take it. By the way, claim damaged items too, not just stolen ones. You might as well ask.
</li><li>Something neat-looking that's light and portable might get nicked. The Portfolio was in a camera bag, so they probably figured it was a camera and yoinked it. Moreover, anything with an Apple logo that's light and portable <em>will</em> get nicked.  These aren't usually technologically savvy people and they know that Apple makes this cool thing called an iPhone and some watch thing and people like those. So they took the PowerBook and Pro Speakers, even though they probably didn't fetch much when they tried to sell them.
</li><li>Conversely, if you make the thieves' job harder, they'll take less. Gangs that hit self-storage units aren't generally the ones that do a whole lot of preplanning and research. Other than maybe renting a unit themselves to look around and get a gate code, they usually won't know the exact interior layout or what units are occupied, and since they won't know what time window they have before any guards or staff come around they'll prefer to grab what's obvious. In my case, the door on the second unit won't fully open without a bit of particular fiddling, so they obviously gave up. Messy units are harder to work in but also harder to steal from. Put high value items in the back and out of view behind big heavy ones. Hide production packaging in non-descript boxes: they <em>didn't</em> get any of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/palm-os-and-the-devices-that-ran-it-an-ars-retrospective/">my Palm Pilot collection</a>, for example, despite being small, portable, frequently in their original boxes and looking like something of value, because they were all in plain cardboard boxes with opaque descriptions in Sharpie marker. But they got the Agenda VR3 box because it was out on the shelf.
</li><li>You don't get what you don't ask for, and you won't get what you don't constantly get on their case about. The adjuster was clearly not a malignant person, just overworked, because this is a cut-rate insurance company who tries to screw their employees just as much as their covered individuals. The squeaky wheel gets the check.
</li><li>You will never get the full replacement value of your items. Ever. In the end, it's just stuff. I'm not happy it got broken into, but I'm not going to shrivel up or shoot myself in the head over it either. Nothing was in there I can't live without.
  </li></ul><p>
Since the break-in occurred, the temporary deadbolt was replaced with a new cipher lock, but this one controls a full deadbolt, not just a door latch. The facility is also gradually converting the roll-up doors to pick-resistant cylinder locks and dispensing with padlocks altogether. I'm hopeful I won't be writing a third blog post on this topic in a few years.

<pre>svec ← {shape←⍬⍴(⍴⍵)*÷2} ##.<a href="https://dfns.dyalog.com/c_sudoku.htm">sudoku</a> prob  ⍝ Solution vector for Sudoku problem ⍵.

The  Sudoku  puzzle  consists  of a 3×3 grid of 3×3 boxes, each cell of which is
either  empty  or contains a number in the range 1 to 9. A typical problem might
look like this:

    ┌─────┬─────┬─────┐
    │· · 1│6 9 ·│5 · ·│
    │4 · ·│2 7 ·│· · 1│
    │· 7 ·│· · ·│· 9 ·│
    ├─────┼─────┼─────┤
    │· · ·│· · ·│· 3 ·│
    │· · ·│4 3 ·│· · 7│
    │· · ·│7 8 ·│6 · ·│
    ├─────┼─────┼─────┤
    │· · 6│· · ·│8 · ·│
    │· 2 ·│1 4 ·│· 6 ·│
    │· 1 ·│3 5 ·│· 4 ·│
    └─────┴─────┴─────┘

The challenge is to supply the missing numbers in such a way that:

    each 3×3 box and
    each 9-item row and
    each 9-item column

contains each of the 9 numbers with no repeats.

A solution to the above problem might be:

    ┌─────┬─────┬─────┐
    │3 8 1│6 9 4│5 7 2│
    │4 6 9│2 7 5│3 8 1│
    │2 7 5│8 1 3│4 9 6│
    ├─────┼─────┼─────┤
    │7 9 4│5 6 2│1 3 8│
    │6 5 8│4 3 1│9 2 7│
    │1 3 2│7 8 9│6 5 4│
    ├─────┼─────┼─────┤
    │5 4 6│9 2 7│8 1 3│
    │9 2 3│1 4 8│7 6 5│
    │8 1 7│3 5 6│2 4 9│
    └─────┴─────┴─────┘

The  puzzle  may  be generalised to accept problems of shape other than 3×3×3×3,
see examples below.

Argument  matrix [prob] contains numbers 1-9 in occupied cells and 0s otherwise.
Optional  left argument [shape] specifies the box shape for non-square problems.
The result is a vector of all solution matrices.

Technical notes:

This solution was supplied by Veli-Matti Jantunen, who says:

⍺ may be used to denote the sudoku rectangle, the default is 2/(↑⍴⍵)*0.5 (eg. if
"mat" is a 6x6 matrix and the sub area is 2 3, the call must be 2 3 sudoku mat).

The result is a vector of all the solutions found, or ⍬ (no solutions) or ''
(error - should not happen, but if there are zillions of results)

The algorithm is simple:
   handle the matrix as a vector
   the rows, columns and sudoku areas are denoted by index vectors
   do the basic checking for the puzzle (i.e. polish) and with the main function
    check one alternative from the list at time:
     filter all the possible elements for all the cells
      if at least one cell is empty = no solution -&gt; take the next from the list
      if one cell contains more than one number -&gt; select the cell from the
         tightest group and add every combination (from this cell) to the list
      if all cells contain one number = solution -&gt; take the next from the list.

Veli-Matti  also  provides this new-from-old problem shuffler:

    Shuffle←{
    ⍝| Shuffle the original sudoku table to another one ;)
    ⍝| ⍺: sudoku box (use for e.g. 6x6 tables, like 2 3 Shuffle table).

        ⍺←(⍴⍵)*0.5 ⋄ (⎕IO ⎕ML ⎕RL)←1 3(⎕TS+.*2)
        (¯1+?3⍴2){(⌽⍣(↑⍺))(⍉⍣(↑1⌽⍺))(⊖⍣(↑⌽⍺))⍵}⍵{(0,(↑⍴⍺)?↑⍴⍺)[⍵⌷⍺+1]}(↑⍴⍵){∊{⍵[(⍴⍵)?⍴⍵]}{⍵[(⍴⍵)?⍴⍵]}¨⍵⊂⍳⍺}¨⍺/¨⍳¨⌽⍺
    }

David Crossley supplies an alternative coding:

        ⍝ The setup is a valid arrangement in some cells of numbers from 1-N; the rest are 0´s.

Finally, here is Arthur Whitney's amazing solution in K 5:

    x(,/{@[x;y;]'(!10)^x*|/p[;y]=p,:,3/:-3!p:!9 9}')/&amp;~*x

Translated by Phil Last into a D-function:

    sudoku←{⎕io←0       ⍝ Whitney/Last
        p←{(↑⍵)∘{(⍺∨.=⍵)/⍳n×n}¨,⍵},(n*÷2){⍵,⍺⊥⌊⍵÷⍺}¨⍳n n←⍴⍵
        m←{(⊂⍵)⌈(⊂⍺=⍳⍴⍵)×(1+⍳n)~⍵[⍺⊃p]}
        (⍴⍵)∘⍴¨⊃{⊃,/⍺ m¨⍵}/{(⍸⍵=0),⊂⊂⍵},⍵
    }

Morten Kromberg's recasting defines some of K's  constructs explicitly and so is
closer to the original.  Note that, like the K version, it takes and returns 81-
vectors, rather than matrices.

    sudoku←{
    ⍝ Define one k fn and one op missing from APL
         wh←{⍸⍵≠0}              ⍝ k '&amp;' function
         mg←{a←⍺ ⋄ a[⍺⍺]←⍵ ⋄ a} ⍝ merge operator: r←old (indexes mg) new

         rcq←(↑,⍳9 9),3/,3⌿3 3⍴⍳9   ⍝ Row, Column, Quadrant
         p←{wh rcq∨.=⍵}¨↓rcq        ⍝ Cells in same row, col or quadrant
         nzd←1+⍳9                   ⍝ Non-zero digits for a little more speed
         ⊃{⊃,/⍺{⍵∘(⍺ mg)¨nzd~⍵[⍺⊃p]}¨⍵}/(wh ⍵=0),⊂⊂⍵ ⍝ kapow!
    }

Roger Hui presents this in the following more beautiful form, generalised for
non-square puzzles:

    Sudoku←{⍺←(⍴⍵)*÷2                   ⍝ Solutions of shape-⍺ Sudoku puzzle ⍵.

        avl  ← {(⍳⊃⍴⍵)~⍵×⊃⍺⌷CMAP}       ⍝ list of available numbers
        emt  ← {(,⍵=0)/,⍳⍴⍵}            ⍝ row &amp; column indices of empty cells

        rcb  ← {(⍳⍴⍵),¨⍺ box(⍴⍵)÷⍺}     ⍝ row/column/box numbers
        box  ← {(⊃⍺)⌿(⊃⌽⍺)/⍵⍴⍳×/⍵}      ⍝ box numbers for a puzzle of size ⍵*2
        cmap ← {⊂[⍳2]1∊¨⍵∘.=⍵}          ⍝ contention map for puzzle ⍵

<ul>
<li><p>"Foo" and "bar" as metasyntactic variables were popularised by MIT and DEC, the first references are in work on LISP and PDP-1 and Project MAC from 1964 onwards.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Many of these people were in MIT's Tech Model Railroad Club, where we find the first documented use of "foo" in tech circles in 1959 (and a variant in 1958).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Both "foo" and "bar" (and even "baz") were well known in popular culture, especially from Smokey Stover and Pogo comics, which will have been read by many TMRC members.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Also, it seems likely the military FUBAR contributed to their popularity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>The use of lone "foo" as a nonsense word is pretty well documented in popular culture in the early 20th century, as is the military FUBAR. (Some background reading:

newspaper &amp; the first newspaper published on the web"), Volume LVII. No. 57, Price Three Cents:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On Foo-ism</p>
<p>The Lounger thinks that this business of Foo-ism has been carried too far by its misguided proponents, and does hereby and forthwith take his stand against its abuse.
It may be that there's no foo like an old foo, and we're it, but anyway, a foo and his money are some party. (Voice from the bleachers- "Don't be foo-lish!")</p>
<p>As an expletive, of course, "foo!" has a definite and probably irreplaceable position in our language, although we fear that the excessive use to which it is currently subjected may well result in its falling into an early (and, alas, a dark) oblivion. We say alas because proper use of the word may result in such happy incidents as the following.</p>
<p>It was an 8.50 Thermodynamics lecture by Professor Slater in Room 6-120. The professor, having covered the front side of the blackboard, set the handle that operates the lift mechanism, turning meanwhile to the class to continue his discussion. The front board slowly, majestically, lifted itself, revealing the board behind it, and on that board, writ large, the symbols that spelled "FOO"!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://tech.mit.edu/V57/PDF/N30.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">The Tech newspaper</a>, a year earlier, the Letter to the Editor, September <strong>1937</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By the time  the  train  has  reached  the station  the  neophytes  are  so  filled with  the  stories  of  the  glory  of  Phi Omicron  Omicron,  usually  referred  to as  Foo,  that  they  are  easy  prey.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>It  is  not  that  I  mind  having  lost my  first  four  sons  to  the  Grand  and Universal  Brotherhood  of  Phi  Omicron  Omicron,  but  I  do  wish  that  my fifth  son,  my  baby,  should  at least  be warned  in  advance.</p>
<p>Hopefully  yours,</p>
<p>Indignant  Mother  of  Five.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And <a href="http://tech.mit.edu/V58/PDF/N48.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">The Tech</a> in December <strong>1938</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General  trend  of  thought  might  be best  interpreted  from  the  remarks
made  at  the  end  of  the  ballots.  One vote  said,  '"I don't  think  what  I  do  is any  of  Pulver's  business,"  while another  merely  added  a  curt  "Foo."</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>The first documented "foo" in tech circles is probably <strong>1959</strong>'s <a href="http://www.gricer.com/tmrc/dictionary1959.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Dictionary of the TMRC Language</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>FOO:  the sacred syllable (FOO MANI PADME HUM); to be spoken only when under inspiration to commune with the Deity. Our first obligation is to keep the Foo Counters turning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are explained at <a href="http://foldoc.org/TMRC" rel="nofollow noreferrer">FOLDOC</a>. The dictionary's compiler Pete Samson said in 2005:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use of this word at TMRC antedates my coming there. A foo counter could simply have randomly flashing lights, or could be a real counter with an obscure input.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And from 1996's <a href="http://www.jargon.net/jargonfile/b/baz.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Jargon File 4.0.0</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Earlier versions of this lexicon derived 'baz' as a Stanford corruption of bar. However, Pete Samson (compiler of the TMRC lexicon) reports it was already current when he joined TMRC in 1958. He says "It came from "Pogo". Albert the Alligator, when vexed or outraged, would shout 'Bazz Fazz!' or 'Rowrbazzle!' The club layout was said to model the (mythical) New England counties of Rowrfolk and Bassex (Rowrbazzle mingled with (Norfolk/Suffolk/Middlesex/Essex)."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A year before the TMRC dictionary, <strong>1958</strong>'s MIT Voo Doo Gazette ("Humor suplement of the MIT Deans' office") <a href="http://web.mit.edu/voodoo/www/archive/pdfs/1958-Jun.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">(PDF)</a> mentions Foocom, in "The Laws of Murphy and Finagle" by John Banzhaf (an electrical engineering student):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Further research under a joint Foocom and Anarcom grant expanded the law to be all embracing and universally applicable: If anything can go wrong, it will!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also <strong>1964</strong>'s MIT Voo Doo <a href="http://web.mit.edu/voodoo/www/archive/pdfs/1964-Jan.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">(PDF)</a> references the TMRC usage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes! I want to be an instant success and snow customers. Send me a degree in:
...</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Foo Counters</p>
</li>
<li><p>Foo Jung</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>But let's remember this question is about code examples, so let's find "foo", "bar" and "foobar" published in code.</p>
<p>So, <a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/F/foobar.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Jargon File 4.4.7</a> says of "foobar":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Probably originally propagated through DECsystem manuals by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in 1960s and early 1970s; confirmed sightings there go back to 1972.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first published reference I can find is from February <strong>1964</strong>, but written in June 1963, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?ei=ynbhTd2PK8nUsgbQurSABg&amp;ct=result&amp;id=eH0sAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22project%20mac%22%20%2bfoo&amp;q=foo#search_anchor" rel="nofollow noreferrer">The Programming Language LISP: its Operation and Applications</a> by Information International, Inc., with many authors, but including Timothy P. Hart and Michael Levin:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus, since "FOO" is a name for itself, "COMITRIN" will treat both "FOO" and "(FOO)" in exactly the same way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also includes other metasyntactic variables such as: FOO CROCK GLITCH / POOT TOOR / ON YOU / SNAP CRACKLE POP / X Y Z</p>
<p>I expect this is much the same as this next reference of "foo" from MIT's Project MAC in January <strong>1964</strong>'s AIM-064, or <a href="http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/5924" rel="nofollow noreferrer">LISP Exercises</a> by Timothy P. Hart and Michael Levin:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>car[((FOO . CROCK) . GLITCH)]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It shares many other metasyntactic variables like: CHI / BOSTON NEW YORK / SPINACH BUTTER STEAK / FOO CROCK GLITCH / POOT TOOP / TOOT TOOT / ISTHISATRIVIALEXCERCISE / PLOOP FLOT TOP / SNAP CRACKLE POP / ONE TWO THREE / PLANE SUB THRESHER</p>
<p>For both "foo" and "bar" together, the earliest reference I could find is from MIT's Project MAC in June <strong>1966</strong>'s AIM-098, or <a href="http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/5899" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PDP-6 LISP</a> by none other than Peter Samson:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>EXPLODE, like PRIN1, inserts slashes, so (EXPLODE (QUOTE FOO/ BAR)) PRIN1's as (F O O // /  B A R) or PRINC's as (F O O /   B A R).</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Some more recallations.</p>
<p><a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/69788/using-foo-and-bar-in-examples/69803#69803">@Walter Mitty</a> recalled on this site in 2008:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I second the jargon file regarding Foo Bar. I can trace it back at least to 1963, and PDP-1 serial number 2, which was on the second floor of Building 26 at MIT. Foo and Foo Bar were used there, and after 1964 at the PDP-6 room at project MAC.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.folklore.computers/browse_thread/thread/f2dcd4247b866a62/fc54f0f7d7329fb5" rel="nofollow noreferrer">John V. Everett</a> recalls in 1996:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I joined DEC in 1966, foobar was already being commonly used as a throw-away file name. I believe fubar became foobar because the PDP-6 supported six character names, although I always assumed the term migrated to DEC from MIT. There were many MIT types at DEC in those days, some of whom had worked with the 7090/7094 CTSS. Since the 709x was also a 36 bit machine, foobar may have been used as a common file name there.</p>
<p>Foo and bar were also commonly used as file extensions. Since the text editors of the day operated on an input file and produced an output file, it was common to edit from a .foo file to a .bar file, and back again.</p>
<p>It was also common to use foo to fill a buffer when editing with TECO. The text string to exactly fill one disk block was IFOO$HXA127GA$$. Almost all of the PDP-6/10 programmers I worked with used this same command string.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dick Gruen had a device in his dorm room, the usual assemblage of B-battery, resistors, capacitors, and NE-2 neon tubes, which he called a "foo counter."  This would have been circa 1964 or so.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.folklore.computers/browse_thread/thread/f2dcd4247b866a62/fc54f0f7d7329fb5" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Robert Schuldenfrei</a> in 1996:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The use of FOO and BAR as example variable names goes back at least to 1964 and the IBM 7070.  This too may be older, but that is where I first saw it.  This was in Assembler.  What would be the FORTRAN integer equivalent? IFOO and IBAR?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The earliest PDP-1 Assembler used two characters for symbols (18 bit machine) programmers always left a few words as patch space to fix problems. (Jump to patch space, do new code, jump back)  That space conventionally was named  FU: which stood for Fxxx Up, the place where you fixed Fxxx Ups.  When spoken, it was known as FU space. Later Assemblers ( e.g. MIDAS allowed three char tags so FU became FOO, and as ALL PDP-1 programmers will tell you that was FOO space.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On the IBM side of FOO(FU)BAR is the use of the BAR side as Base Address Register; in the middle 1970's CICS programmers had to worry out the various xxxBARs...I think one of those was FRACTBAR...</p>

                        <div><p>Starch is a natural polymer which is commonly used as a cooking ingredient. The renewability and bio-degradability of starch has made it an interesting material for industrial applications, such as production of bioplastic. This paper introduces the application of corn starch in the production of a novel construction material, named CoRncrete. CoRncrete is formed by mixing corn starch with sand and water. The mixture appears to be self-compacting when wet. The mixture is poured in a mould and then heated in a microwave or an oven. This heating causes a gelatinisation process which results in a hardened material having compressive strength up to 26&nbsp;MPa. The factors affecting the strength of hardened CoRncrete such as water content, sand aggregate size and heating procedure have been studied. The degradation and sustainability aspects of CoRncrete are elucidated and limitations in the potential application of this material are discussed.</p></div>

He says that three days after receiving the therapy, he felt his skin loosen and he could start moving his fingers and opening his mouth again. Two weeks later, he returned to his office job. “I feel very good,” he says, more than a year after receiving the treatment.</p><p>Engineered immune cells, called chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, have shown <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00241-0" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00241-0" data-track-category="body text link">great promise</a> in treating blood cancers — half a dozen products are <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2017.22304" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2017.22304" data-track-category="body text link">approved</a> in the United States — and potential for treating autoimmune conditions such as <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00169-7" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00169-7" data-track-category="body text link">lupus</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00470-5" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00470-5" data-track-category="body text link">multiple sclerosis</a>, in which rogue immune cells release autoantibodies that attack the body’s own tissue. But the therapy typically relies on a person’s own immune cells, and this personalization makes it expensive and time consuming.</p><p>That’s why researchers have started creating CAR T therapies from donated immune cells. If successful, they would allow pharmaceutical companies to scale up manufacturing, potentially <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00809-y" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00809-y" data-track-category="body text link">slashing costs</a> and production times. Instead of making one treatment for one person, therapies for more than a hundred people could be made from one donor’s cells, says Lin Xin, an immunologist at Tsinghua University in Beijing. Donor-derived CAR T cells have been used to treat people with cancers, but with limited success so far<sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup>.</p><h2>Autoimmune diseases</h2><p>The trial, led by Xu Huji, a rheumatologist at Naval Medical University in Shanghai, is the first to report results for autoimmune diseases. They were published in <i>Cell</i> last month. More than six months after receiving the treatment, the recipients remained in remission. Another two dozen individuals have received the donor-derived treatment and a slightly modified product, says Xu. The results have been largely positive, he says.</p><p>“The clinical outcomes are phenomenal,” says Lin, who is leading a separate trial using donor-derived CAR T cells to treat lupus.</p><p>The success and safety of the therapy look promising but still need to be demonstrated in many more people before researchers can draw conclusions about its broad application, says Christina Bergmann, a rheumatologist at the University Hospital Erlangen in Germany.</p><p>But if it does succeed in more people over a longer time frame, it “could prove paradigm shifting”, says Daniel Baker, an immunologist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. More than 80 autoimmune diseases are linked to malfunctioning immune cells.</p><h2>Healthy donor</h2><p>CAR-T-cell therapy typically involves extracting immune cells known as T cells from the person being treated. The cells are embellished with CAR proteins that target B cells and are then re-infused into the person’s body.</p><p>The process for creating CAR T cells from donated immune cells is similar. Xu and his colleagues extracted T cells from a 21-year-old woman and studded them with CARs that recognize CD19, a receptor found on the surface of B cells. They used the CRISPR–Cas9 gene-editing tool to knock out five genes in the T cells, to prevent both the grafted cells from attacking the host’s body and the host’s immune system from attacking the donor cells.</p><p>The first person to receive the treatment, in May 2023, was a 42-year-old woman with a type of autoimmune myopathy, which targets skeletal muscle tissue, resulting in weakness and fatigue. Mr Gong, and another man aged 45, had an aggressive form of sclerosis. They started their treatments in June and August 2023.</p><p>Once injected into the hosts, the CAR T cells got to work. They multiplied and targeted and destroyed all the B cells — including pathogenic cells linked to the autoimmune conditions. The bioengineered T cells survived for weeks in the recipients before largely vanishing. Eventually, new healthy B cells returned, but no pathogenic ones did. A similar response has been observed in people with <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03968-6" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03968-6" data-track-category="body text link">autoimmune conditions</a> who received CAR T cells derived from their own cells<sup><a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">3</a></sup>.</p><h2>‘Complete remission’</h2><p>Two months after the treatment, the researchers say the woman achieved complete remission, and maintained that status at her six-month follow-up. Baker says that although the woman showed clear clinical improvements, he would be more cautious about calling it complete remission, given the short assessment time. The woman’s autoantibodies had dropped to undetectable levels, and her muscle strength and mobility had improved dramatically.</p><p>The two men also saw significant improvements in their symptoms — including the reversal of scar-tissue formation — and declines in autoantibody levels.</p><p>None of the individuals experienced an extreme inflammatory reaction known as cytokine-release syndrome, which has been observed in some people with cancer who have received CAR-T therapy, and they didn’t show evidence of the graft attacking the host. But the researchers are still trying to determine whether the host’s body rejects the graft over time.</p><p>One key safety concern observed in some people who have received CAR-T-cell therapy to treat cancer is the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01215-0" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01215-0" data-track-category="body text link">emergence of new tumours</a>, although researchers are still investigating whether they are linked to the therapy. Baker says it’s too early to know whether people with autoimmune conditions who are treated with donor-derived CAR T cells will face this risk. “Only time will tell.“</p><p>The big question now, Baker says, is whether the same approach will work in more people, and how durable the effects will be. “Will these patients stay symptom-free for years?”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Cloudflare on Thursday celebrated a victory over Sable Networks, which the former described as a "patent troll."</p>
<p>That’s a term for an individual or organization that exists solely to makes patent infringement claims in the hope of winning a settlement from defendants concerned about costly patent litigation.</p>
<p>"Sable sued Cloudflare back in March 2021," wrote Emily Terrell and Patrick Nemeroff, respectively Cloudflare’s senior counsel for litigation and senior associate general counsel, in a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/patent-troll-sable-pays-up/">write-up</a> Wednesday.</p>

    

<p>"Sable is a patent troll. It doesn’t make, develop, innovate, or sell anything. Sable IP is merely a shell entity formed to monetize (make money from) an ancient patent portfolio acquired by Sable Networks from Caspian Networks in 2006."</p>

        


        

<p>Patent trolls have vexed the technology industry for years, sometimes even drawing regulatory responses as happened over a decade ago when opportunistic litigants focused on patents pertinent to the emerging smartphone market. The Obama administration responded by issuing a set of <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2013/06/04/fact-sheet-white-house-task-force-high-tech-patent-issues">executive actions</a> to curb abuses.</p>
<p>Lately, these patent profiteers have targeted the open source community. The Cloud Native Computing Foundation and Linux Foundation last month <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/18/open_source_orgs_strengthen_alliance/">strengthened ties</a> with United Patents, a company focused on defending against predatory patent claims.</p>

        

<p>Five other companies that we know of sued by Sable – Cisco, Fortinet, Check Point, SonicWall, and Juniper Networks – settled out of court. Splunk, meanwhile, fought back and managed last year to convince Sable <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/leadership/splunk-defeats-non-practicing-entities-in-three-patent-cases.html">to dismiss</a> its claim against the operation prior to its <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/03/19/cisco_closes_splunk_acquisition/">takeover</a> by, funnily enough, Cisco.</p>
<p>Internet services giant Cloudflare has notched up an even greater victory. Facing an initial infringement lawsuit regarding around a hundred claims related to four patents, the corporation ended up having to deal with just a single patent violation claim.</p>

</ul>
<p>In February, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/12/cloudflare_patent_troll/">Cloudflare prevailed</a> when a Texas jury found it did not infringe Sable's "micro-flow label switching" <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US7012919B1/en">patent</a>.</p>
<p>The biz both convinced the jury that it did not use the "micro-flow" technology described in the US patent 7,012,919 and that the patent was invalid because of prior art.</p>
<p>The existence of two earlier US patents, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US6584071B1/en?oq=6584071">6,584,071</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US6680933B1/en?oq=6680933">6,680,933</a> for router technology developed by Nortel Networks and Lucent in the 1990s convinced the jury that Sable's '919 patent should never have been granted.</p>

        

<p>The matter also saw Sable pledge not to pursue further actions of this sort.</p>
<p>"In the end, Sable agreed to pay Cloudflare $225,000, grant Cloudflare a royalty-free license to its entire patent portfolio, and to dedicate its patents to the public, ensuring that Sable can never again assert them against another company," said Terrell and Nemeroff.</p>
<p>The agreement means that Sable will tell the US Patent and Trademark Office that it is abandoning its patent rights and no further claims based on those patents will be possible.</p>
<p><em>The Register</em> called Sable’s listed phone number, and it is no longer in service. The company's website is unresponsive and an attorney for the firm did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Terrell and Nemeroff said that prior art submissions for the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/jengo/sable-rules/">Sable case</a> related to Project Jengo, a crowd-sourced patent invalidation initiative, will be accepted until November 2, 2024. At some point thereafter, Cloudflare, which has already given out $70,000 in awards for the case, will select final award winners.</p>
<p>"We're proud of our work fighting patent trolls and believe that the outcome in this case sends a strong message that Cloudflare will fight back against meritless patent cases and we will win," a spokesperson for Cloudflare told <em>The Register</em>. ®</p>

<div><p>My insight into corporate legal disputes is as meaningful as my opinion on Quantum Mechanics. What I do know is that, when given the chance this week to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/04/159-employees-are-leaving-automattic-as-ceos-fight-with-wp-engine-escalates/?zeldman">leave my job with half a year’s salary paid in advance</a>, I chose to stay at <a href="applenotes:note/e336c252-1a41-4523-9974-ddd94bfa772b?ownerIdentifier=_ab35500906b57133eafa73464d88463e">Automattic</a>.</p><p>Listen, I’m struggling with medical debts and financial obligations incurred by the closing of my conference and <a href="https://abookapart.com/">publishing</a> businesses. Six months’ salary in advance would have wiped the slate clean. From a fiduciary point of view, if nothing else, I had to at least consider <a href="https://ma.tt/2024/10/alignment/">my CEO’s offer</a> to walk out the door with a big bag of dollars.</p><p>But even as I made myself think about what six months’ salary in a lump sum could do to help my family and calm my creditors, I knew in my soul there was no way I’d leave this company. Not by my own choice, anyway.</p><p>I respect the courage and conviction of my departed colleagues. I already miss them, and most only quit yesterday. I feel their departure as a personal loss, and my grief is real. The sadness is like a cold fog on a dark, wet night. </p><p>The next weeks will be challenging. My remaining coworkers and I will work twice as hard to cover temporary employee shortfalls and recruit new teammates, while also navigating the complex personal feelings these two weeks of sudden, surprising change have brought on. <em>Who needs the aggravation, right?</em> But I stayed.</p><p>I stayed because I believe in <a href="https://automattic.com/about/">the work we do</a>. I believe in the open web and owning your own content. I’ve devoted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Zeldman">nearly three decades of work</a> to this cause, and when I chose to move in-house, I knew there was only one house that would suit me. In nearly six years at Automattic, I’ve been able to do work that mattered to me and helped others, and I know that the best is yet to come.&nbsp;</p></div>
<p>I also know that the <a href="https://dri.es/solving-the-maker-taker-problem">Maker-Taker problem</a> is an issue in open source, just as I know that a friend you buy lunch for every day, and who earns as much money as you do, is supposed to return the favor now and then. If a friend takes advantage, you’re supposed to say or do something about it. Addressing these imbalances is rarely pretty. Doing it in public takes its own kind of courage. Now it’s for the lawyers to sort out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On May 1, 1992, a man who’d been horribly beaten by the L.A. police called for calm in five heartfelt, memorable words: “Can’t we all get along?” We couldn’t then, and we aren’t, now, but my job at Automattic is about helping people, and that remains my focus at the conclusion of this strange and stressful week. I’m grateful that making the tough business decisions isn’t my responsibility. In that light, my decision to stay at Automattic was easy.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>John didn’t start his career mad. </p><p>He trained as an emergency medicine doctor in a tidily run Midwestern emergency room about a decade ago. He loved the place, especially the way its management was so responsive to the doctors’ needs, offering extra staffing when things got busy and paid administrative time for teaching other trainees. Doctors provided most of the care, occasionally overseeing the work of <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/24050901/nurse-practitioner-physician-assistant-doctor-health-care-quality">nurse practitioners and physician associates</a>. He signed on to start there full-time shortly after finishing his residency.</p><p>A month before his start date, a <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/1/6/21024740/private-equity-taylor-swift-toys-r-us-elizabeth-warren">private equity firm</a> bought the practice. “I can’t even tell you how quickly it changed,” John says. The ratio of doctors to other clinicians flipped, shrinking doctor hours to a minimum as the firm moved to save on salaries.</p><p>John — who is being referred to by a pseudonym due to concerns over professional repercussions — quit and found a job at another emergency room in a different state. It too soon sold out to the same private equity firm. Then it happened again, and then again. Small emergency rooms “kept getting gobbled up by these gigantic corporations so fast,” he said. By the time doctors tried to jump ship to another ER, “they were already sold out.”</p><p>At all of the private equity-acquired ERs where John worked, things changed almost overnight: In addition to having their hours cut, doctors were docked pay if they didn’t evaluate new arrivals within 25 minutes of them walking through the door, leading to hasty orders for “kitchen sink” workups geared mostly toward productivity — not toward real cost-effectiveness or diagnostic precision. Amid all of this, cuts to their hours when ER volumes were low meant John and his colleagues’ pay was all over the place.</p><p>Patient care was suffering “from the toe sprains all the way up to the gunshot wounds and heart attacks,” says John. His experience wasn’t an anomaly — it was happening in emergency rooms across the country. “All of my colleagues were experiencing the same thing.”</p><div><p>“Were they going to die anyway? Maybe. But that’s not how I sleep at night. That was four years ago. I think about that guy every day.” </p></div><p>At times, the short staffing combined with the pressure to churn patients led to deadly shortcuts. John remembers rushing to evaluate one patient and missing his extensive history of alcohol abuse. The patient spent hours getting tests directed at the wrong diagnosis.</p><p>John could have put together a more appropriate plan if he’d had a few more minutes to sit down and get a better history, but by the time he realized what was going on, the patient was too severely ill. He died in the intensive care unit two days later.</p><p>“Is that 100 percent because of that staffing? Probably not,” says John. “But if I wasn’t so stressed about jumping into that patient room, making sure my door-to-provider time was less than 25 minutes …” The hypothetical hangs in the air.</p><p>“Were they going to die anyway? Maybe. But that’s not how I sleep at night. That was four years ago. I think about that guy every day.” </p><div><div><p><a href="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/240917_xinmei_Vox_ER-Monster_spot1_v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0,0,100,100" data-pswp-height="1800" data-pswp-width="1800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img alt="An illustration of a giant round orange monster casting a dark shadow over an emergency medical center with medical equipment dangling from its teeth." data-chromatic="ignore" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 639px) 100vw, (max-width: 1023px) 50vw, 700px" srcset="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/240917_xinmei_Vox_ER-Monster_spot1_v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=256 256w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/240917_xinmei_Vox_ER-Monster_spot1_v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=376 376w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/240917_xinmei_Vox_ER-Monster_spot1_v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=384 384w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/240917_xinmei_Vox_ER-Monster_spot1_v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=415 415w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/240917_xinmei_Vox_ER-Monster_spot1_v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=480 480w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/240917_xinmei_Vox_ER-Monster_spot1_v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=540 540w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/240917_xinmei_Vox_ER-Monster_spot1_v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=640 640w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/240917_xinmei_Vox_ER-Monster_spot1_v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=750 750w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/240917_xinmei_Vox_ER-Monster_spot1_v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=828 828w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/240917_xinmei_Vox_ER-Monster_spot1_v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=1080 1080w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/240917_xinmei_Vox_ER-Monster_spot1_v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=1200 1200w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/240917_xinmei_Vox_ER-Monster_spot1_v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=1440 1440w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/240917_xinmei_Vox_ER-Monster_spot1_v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=1920 1920w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/240917_xinmei_Vox_ER-Monster_spot1_v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=2048 2048w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/240917_xinmei_Vox_ER-Monster_spot1_v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=2400 2400w" src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/240917_xinmei_Vox_ER-Monster_spot1_v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=2400"></a></p></div><p><cite>Xinmei Liu for Vox</cite></p></div><p>The story of how private equity has been able to so thoroughly debilitate emergency care is one of the more dramatic examples of how corporate interests are corrosive to America’s health care system — and how powerless they leave individual consumers. Today, private equity continues to operate a shocking <a href="https://emworkforce.substack.com/p/state-of-the-us-emergency-medicine-677">quarter of ERs nationwide</a>, as of March 2024. </p><p>Still, there’s some hope: Academics, patient advocates, and doctors say you can make defensive moves to protect your finances and care before, during, and after you or a loved one visits an ER. </p><p>Understanding private equity’s transformation of America’s emergency rooms is the first step. </p><div><p id="how-private-equity-sunk-its-claws-into-emergency-care"><h2>How private equity sunk its claws into emergency care </h2></p></div><p>Modern private equity got its start in the early 1980s, when a free-market acolyte — and former member of the Nixon administration — completed the first major “<a href="https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/private-equity-is-out-of-control-and-looting-america-this-prosecutor-says-we-can-fix-it">leveraged buyout</a>.” Using mostly borrowed money, William Simon and his partner bought a greeting card company, extracted <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/07/business/reaping-the-big-profits-from-a-fat-cat.html">huge fees</a>, and then sold it for a massive profit less than two years later. </p><p>Over the next few decades, what was then called the leveraged buyout industry moved into other sectors. Firms flipped businesses to yield spectacular profits, often cutting corners on the products and services they offered, eliminating jobs, and reducing employee benefits. </p><p>It was only a matter of time until the industry, now rebranded as private equity, turned its gaze on the US’s $4 trillion health care sector, which was already becoming <a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/explainer/2023/nov/private-equity-role-health-care#:~:text=Given%20its%20short%2Dterm%20financial,reduce%20costs%2C%20thus%20improving%20value.">increasingly commercialized</a> as nonprofit health systems consolidated, paid their executives <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/2023/2/24/23610762/hospital-ceo-nurses-salary-study-north-carolina">ever more extravagant salaries</a>, and otherwise played business hardball. Private equity takeovers in health care <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5673a288-f55b-4cfd-aa76-0ebb30b029a6">started around 2000</a> and have steadily increased since; when several big banks crumbled in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, private equity’s growth only accelerated. </p><p>Emergency medicine wasn’t always an appealing target for private equity. Physician staffing in many emergency rooms around the country was traditionally handled by <a href="https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/welcome-to-the-emergency-room-a-wall-street-honcho-will-decide-your-treatment">co-op-like groups, run by working doctors</a>, that contracted with hospitals. In the 1990s, <a href="https://substack.perfectunion.us/p/what-happens-when-private-equity">ex-physicians and businesspeople</a> began taking ownership of these so-called contract management groups (CMGs). As they did, they started acting more like for-profit businesses, centralizing decision-making and earnings. </p><p>The easier it was to make decisions that prioritized profits, the more money CMGs made — and the more attractive they became to private equity. </p><p><a href="https://academic.oup.com/healthaffairsscholar/article/1/1/qxad008/7203733?login=false">Through the mid- to late-2010s</a>, private equity firms swallowed up a shocking number of American emergency rooms, leaving in their wake a generationally hollowed-out system for providing emergency care to people across the country. Private equity firms and other corporate interests owned nearly 9 percent of ER doctor groups in 2009; by 2019, they owned <a href="https://academic.oup.com/healthaffairsscholar/article/1/1/qxad008/7203733?login=false">22 percent</a>. The wave of takeovers and consolidations peaked in 2021 but carries on all over the US, especially in Florida, Texas, and other <a href="https://academic.oup.com/healthaffairsscholar/article/1/1/qxad008/7203733?login=false">parts of the South and West where the firms have been most aggressive</a>. </p><p>Doctors trying to practice medicine the way they’d been trained to — with a priority on patient care, not profits — found they couldn’t outrun the monster. Private equity’s dominance persisted even after the federal <a href="https://www.cms.gov/files/document/nsa-keyprotections.pdf">No Surprises Act</a>, enacted in 2022, made many of their most profitable practices illegal.</p><p>Lots of for-profit models are a bad fit for health care, but of all of them, private equity is perhaps the worst, says <a href="https://pestakeholder.org/about-us/meet-the-team/">Eileen O’Grady</a>, director of programs at the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, a nonprofit watchdog group: “It basically takes the for-profit model and makes it so much more extractive and so much more harmful and risky.”</p><div><p id="private-equity-puts-profit-above-all-else"><h2>Private equity puts profit above all else </h2></p></div><p>To understand what makes private equity such a malignant force in health care, you have to understand its uniquely craven and purposefully opaque corporate structure. </p><p>Imagine you own a lemonade stand, and you want it to make more money. You have a few options: You can plow all your profits back into the business until it grows — what business school types call organic growth. Alternatively, you can get a bank loan. If you’re really ambitious, you can sell shares of your lemonade stand to the general public by promising them a good return on their investment. </p><p>There’s another option here, one that will make you richer quicker: You can sell all or most of the stand to the rich kid at the end of the street. He’s offering you a lot of money for it — more than you’d get over the short term from the other options. That’s because he’s taken out a huge loan to pay for the deal.</p><p>But there are a couple of catches: First, if he runs into financial trouble (which he very well might, since he’s been buying up lemonade stands all over town), he’ll sell it off for parts, leaving the neighborhood lemonade-less. This will cost him nothing personally because he used the lemonade stand as collateral for that big loan.</p><p>The second and perhaps more important catch is that this kid is buying your lemonade stand in order to sell it. He doesn’t care about lemonade or the people who like it. His strategy is to make the stand’s balance sheet look so attractive that a few years later, another investor will buy it at a premium — or if that fails, then yes, to sell it off for parts.

Depressing, but not a life-and-death issue. When private equity comes for health care, though, the result is human suffering: Elderly and intellectually disabled people <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/kendalltaggart/kkr-brightspring-disability-private-equity-abuse">sitting in puddles of their own waste</a>, sick patients <a href="https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/democrats/2024/7/predatory-private-equity-practices-threaten-americans-health-and-the-economy#:~:texthttps://www.jec.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/democrats/2024/7/predatory-private-equity-practices-threaten-americans-health-and-the-economy">not getting the care they need</a>, <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/infections-falls-increased-private-equity-owned-hospitals">worse outcomes for patients</a>. It’s not just lemonade. People’s lives are at stake.</p></div><p>The way private equity gets into emergency care is by buying out the CMGs that manage physician staffing — that is to say, the firms only buy the clinicians themselves. </p><p>It’s a different model than when private equity invests in other areas of health care. When firms buy hospitals, nursing homes, medical practices, rehabilitation facilities, and group homes, they acquire not only staff, but also buildings, land, and medical equipment.</p><p>In the case of emergency care, “private equity doesn’t pay the hospital rent, they don’t hire the nurses, they don’t pay the electric bills, they don’t provide any of the equipment,” says <a href="https://medicine.temple.edu/robert-mcnamara">Robert McNamara</a>, chair of the emergency medicine department at Temple University in Philadelphia. The hospital still handles those finances. “They’re just working the labor force. … The highest-cost thing on their expense side is the board-certified emergency physician.” </p><p>When emergency rooms first caught the eye of private equity firms, the prospective investors offered the physician owners of CMGs huge payouts. </p><p><a href="https://www.ivyclinicians.io/about">Leon Adelman</a>, an emergency medicine doctor who leads the staffing firm <a href="https://emworkforce.substack.com/p/state-of-the-us-emergency-medicine-677">Ivy Clinicians</a> and writes a workforce-focused <a href="https://emworkforce.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=substack_profile">newsletter</a>, says the owners faced a tough choice: “‘Do I do what is ethical and feels right … and I get a nice going-away party and maybe a watch or something — or do I get $10 million?’”</p><p>“What they were buying was the ability to charge patients who were consuming a non-shoppable service,” Adelman says — one for which patients are unable to compare prices. If you’re having a heart attack, you’re not going to call around to hospitals to find out who is going to give you the best deal.</p><p>Hospitals that increasingly have profit on the brain often found private equity a more attractive partner than doctor-owned CMGs. The firms are flush with cash, which means they don’t look to the hospitals to shore up their finances. “They won’t ask you for a penny,” Adelman explains. “They’re making plenty of money.” </p><p>Once a private equity firm bought an emergency room, there were two levers it could pull to make a profit: It could maximize what it reaped from patients who’d received services, and it could cut what it spent paying the clinicians who provided those services.</p><p>Doing both at the same time has made emergency medicine practically unrecognizable.</p><div><p id="burned-out-doctors-screwed-over-patients"><h2>Burned-out doctors, screwed-over patients</h2></p></div><p>Under new private equity ownership, ERs adopted an assortment of unsavory practices. Firms not only pressured clinicians to see patients faster, as illustrated by John’s experience, but to recommend <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w23623">hospital admission</a> for more patients. They also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/24/upshot/the-company-behind-many-surprise-emergency-room-bills.html">dramatically raised the price tags</a> for a range of emergency services, resulting in back-breakingly large bills for patients nationwide, like ones charging <a href="https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/er-doctor-private-equity-in-medicine-is-dangerous-to-patients">thousands of dollars</a> for glue applied to a half-inch wound.</p><p>To avoid having to negotiate those astronomical bills with the expert hagglers at insurance companies, firms kept their ERs from participating in many insurance networks. It was easier to collect on a so-called balance bill — the portion of a medical bill not paid for by a patient’s insurer — if the care a patient had received wasn’t covered by their insurance at all. </p><p>In a study of two of the largest emergency medicine staffing firms in the US, health economist Zack Cooper found <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w23623">costs to patients went up more than 80 percent</a> after a corporate interest took ownership. </p><div><div><p><a href="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/240917_xinmei_Vox_ER-Monster_spot4_v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0,0,100,100" data-pswp-height="1800" data-pswp-width="1800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img alt="An illustration of a doctor running in three different directions with timers floating above her head.

According to reporting by <a href="https://www.levernews.com/private-equity-gloats-over-a-doctor-glut/">Lever</a>, the private equity-funded staffing firm American Physician Partners told investors they expected the surplus to eventually save them an expected $20 million in annual payroll costs.</p><p>There are good reasons to believe that private equity’s soup-to-nuts transformation of emergency care has had a devastating effect on physician morale and patient care — and many emergency doctors <a href="https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/er-doctor-private-equity-in-medicine-is-dangerous-to-patients">say both are true</a>. In lemonade-stand terms, private equity is “diluting the lemonade, but charging six times as much,” Adelman says, and their customers are “dying of thirst.” </p><p>Emergency medicine has long been among the most stressful physician specialties. However, in recent years, the burnout rate has climbed to <a href="https://www.chiefhealthcareexecutive.com/view/nearly-half-of-doctors-report-burnout-but-there-is-some-progress-survey-finds">63 percent</a>, according to a 2024 Medscape survey, and the specialty is <a href="https://www.advisory.com/daily-briefing/2023/03/21/ed-doctors#:~:text=According%20to%20Elizabeth%20Datner%2C%20chair,thousand%20cuts%2C%22%20she%20said.">losing popularity</a> among medical students. Doctors’ decision-making authority is their currency; “To have that taken away because of leadership and ownership models that negate that authority is really disheartening, and leads to burnout and, really, moral injury,” says <a href="https://www.acep.org/people-pages/board/aisha-terry">Aisha Terry</a>, a Washington, DC, emergency room doctor and president of the American College of Emergency Physicians, an advocacy and education nonprofit. </p><div><p>In lemonade-stand terms, private equity is “diluting the lemonade, but charging six times as much,” Adelman says, and their customers are “dying of thirst” </p></div><p>Meanwhile, finding concrete data proving patient harms is difficult. <a href="https://vivo.brown.edu/display/ysingh11">Yashaswini Singh</a>, a health care economist who studies changes in physician practices acquired by private equity funds, says linking patient outcomes with private equity involvement is “a Herculean task.” Still, researchers are on the case, and so are legislators — earlier this year, Sen. Gary Peters (D-MI) <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-care/senate-questions-private-equity-hospital-emergency-departments-peters-rcna145909">initiated an investigation</a> into private equity’s effects on the quality of emergency care. </p><p>Private equity can only do what it does because so many other parts of American health care are so dysfunctional. “Just to be really clear, private equity is not the main harm of health care in the US,” says O’Grady. “I think it’s a symptom of a much bigger problem.”</p><p>In the US health care ecosystem, private equity is a bottom-feeder, an entity that can only exist because of the bad behavior and misaligned incentives of the bigger players in the marketplace. Private equity’s deep pockets, its willingness to extort patients, its heavy-handedness with telling doctors how to practice wouldn’t be possible — much less an advantage — in the absence of these larger upstream problems. </p><p>Maybe there wouldn’t be as many <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/private-equity-investment-as-a-divining-rod-for-market-failure-policy-responses-to-harmful-physician-practice-acquisitions/">opportunities for private equity to make money</a> in health care if hospital budgets were stable; if insurance companies didn’t play hardball with both providers and patients; if pharmaceutical industry players didn’t artificially and unevenly inflate drug prices; if elected officials weren’t so susceptible to powerful lobbies that block comprehensive, loophole-closing health care reform.</p><p>That’s not the world we live in, however; and because the American health care system is broken in these and so many other ways, private equity thrives within it, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/10/private-equity-publicly-traded-companies/675788/">often invisibly</a>. </p><div><p id="congress-tried-to-fix-the-problem-but-fell-short"><h2><strong>Congress tried to fix the problem — but fell short</strong></h2></p></div><p>In 2020, Congress threw a huge wrench in the private equity game plan when it passed the <a href="https://www.cms.gov/files/document/nsa-keyprotections.pdf">No Surprises Act</a>, aimed at saving patients from receiving shocking bills after getting emergency care. </p><p>When the law took effect in January 2022, it meant that patients who receive emergency care can’t get billed for out-of-network care, even if the care is from an out-of-network facility or doctor. (They do still have to pay whatever deductibles, copays, or coinsurance their insurance plan would require related to an in-network visit.) It also protects people from higher bills if they get routine, non-emergency care at an in-network facility from an out-of-network doctor without their knowledge or consent. </p><p>Billers — including private equity owners of emergency medicine practices — now have to ask insurance companies to pay the balance of their out-of-network bills. It turns out it’s a lot harder to extract unreasonable fees from insurance companies than from individuals. </p><p>The act served as the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/american-physician-partners-files-for-bankruptcy-after-shutdown-5792e23c">death</a> (or <a href="https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/fitch-downgrades-team-health-holdings-inc-to-ccc-13-11-2023">near</a>-<a href="https://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/envision-healthcare-files-chapter-11-bankruptcy">death</a>) blow for several emergency medicine groups backed by private equity, which at their peak staffed nearly one-fifth of American emergency departments. That really only means some of these firms are now being run with oversight from courts and creditors, not that all of them are out of business: They’re largely still standing, and many have since only expanded their footprint in emergency care. </p><div><div><p><a href="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/240917_xinmei_Vox_ER-Monster_spot2_v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0,0,100,100" data-pswp-height="1800" data-pswp-width="1800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img alt="An illustration of a giant orange monster peeking in the window of an emergency room’s seating area.

Many people simply are <a href="https://gop-waysandmeans.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Spicer-Testimony.pdf">unaware when they’ve been incorrectly billed</a>. Clinicians and the facilities they work for occasionally don’t follow the legislation’s rules, or inappropriately ask patients to waive their protections. Insurance companies don’t automatically absolve patients of responsibility for a surprise out-of-network bill, and the appeals process is complicated and time-consuming. And there are loopholes: Out-of-network ambulances and urgent care facilities aren’t covered, and neither is the follow-up care people get after an emergency room visit.</p><p>The emergency medicine profession, meanwhile, will take a while to recover from private equity’s onslaught. John’s colleagues are the kinds of doctors who will drive a patient home if they don’t have a ride, he says. Many of the people who seek care in American emergency rooms live on the poorest and most marginalized fringes of society; emergency medicine doctors know this, and for some of them, it’s an important reason they chose the work.</p><p>“This is not about pay for us,” he says. “This is just about being fair and letting us practice how we want to practice. And that’s gone.”</p><div><div><p id="what-to-do-when-you-need-emergency-care"><h2><strong>What to do when you need emergency care</strong></h2></p></div><p>It has to be said: Patients shouldn’t have to be shrewd when navigating a system that’s supposed to care for them at their most vulnerable, or risk both their life and their finances. And yet, that’s the health care system the US has. </p><p>It’s hard for people to tell when a private equity firm has taken over a local emergency room. It’s not like the firm slaps its logo on the side of the building. Patients usually don’t even know until they get a bill that an investment company had a hand in determining who saw them in the emergency room and what kind of workup they ordered, says McNamara<strong>.</strong> </p><p>Given that reality, anyone who may one day visit an emergency room in the middle of a crisis — that is to say, nearly everyone — should know how to protect themselves, says <a href="https://pirg.org/people/patricia-kelmar/">Patricia Kelmar</a>, who directs health care campaigns for the Public Interest Research Group (PIRG). There are things you can do to ensure you don’t end up with an astronomical bill. </p><div><p id="know-where-to-go-and-who-is-treating-you"><h3><strong>Know where to go and who is treating you</strong></h3></p></div><p>Some situations don’t permit much decision-making about which emergency room you’ll go to or how you’ll get there. Still, it’s worth making an advance plan for where you’ll go if you have the option.</p><p>Cooper, the health economist, says an emergency room’s ownership isn’t the only thing that matters in deciding whether to go there in an emergency. If a private equity-owned ER sees a higher patient volume than others and is affiliated with an academic institution, it may still be the best option.</p><p>Even with the No Surprises Act in place, care from in-network doctors at in-network hospitals is far less likely to result in unpleasant bills. So before you need an emergency room, check with your insurance company to see which ones are in network and nearest to you. Once you’re at an emergency room, Cooper suggests asking to see an in-network physician. </p><div><p id="make-a-plan-for-how-to-get-there"><h3><strong>Make a plan for how to get there</strong></h3></p></div><p>Ambulance transport is <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/why-unexpectedly-high-ambulance-bills-are-still-a-problem-in-the-u-s#:~:text=Every%20year%2C%20roughly%203%20million,transports%20are%20out%20of%20network">unlikely to be cost-free</a> for most Americans, so if you need to get to an emergency room and you’re in stable condition, it’s worth trying to get there in other ways. </p><p>Air ambulances are covered by the No Surprises Act, but ground ambulances are not, and are unfortunately often out-of-network for many people. The ones owned by private equity are especially <a href="https://healthpolicy.usc.edu/research/ground-ambulance-billing-and-prices-differ-by-ownership-structure/">likely to be wildly expensive</a>. Nevertheless, many states have laws to protect consumers from outrageous ambulance bills — but <a href="https://pirg.org/edfund/resources/emergency-the-high-cost-of-ambulance-surprise-bills/">only if their plan is state-regulated</a>, which means about 60 percent of insured people are still unprotected. You can figure out if yours is one of them by contacting your <a href="https://content.naic.org/state-insurance-departments">state’s insurance department</a>. </p><p>You can also work with your insurance company and the ambulance company to negotiate big bills; legal aid organizations can also provide assistance. </p><div><p id="understand-what-youre-signing"><h3><strong>Understand what you’re signing</strong></h3></p></div><p>Non-emergency hospital departments (for example, the ones that would take care of you if you had to stay in the hospital for more care after an ER visit) are allowed to ask you to sign away your No Surprises Act protections. The form they use to do this is, totally unironically, called a <a href="https://www.cms.gov/files/document/notice-and-consent-form-example.pdf">Surprise Billing Protection Form</a>. </p><p>Emergency rooms, however, aren’t allowed to ask you to sign this waiver. If they do, say no and report the violation to the <a href="https://www.cms.gov/medical-bill-rights/help/submit-a-complaint">No Surprises Help Desk</a> by calling 1-800-985-3059. Almost every US hospital still has to provide care for you under <a href="https://www.cms.gov/priorities/your-patient-rights/emergency-room-rights">US law</a>.</p><div><p id="if-you-get-a-wonky-bill-file-a-complaint"><h3><strong>If you get a wonky bill, file a complaint</strong></h3></p></div><p>If you do still end up with a nonsensically large bill, you can push back and appeal decisions — again, by reaching out to the <a href="https://www.cms.gov/medical-bill-rights/help/submit-a-complaint">No Surprises Help Desk</a>. </p><p>Additional guidance on your medical billing rights is available on the <a href="https://pirg.org/resources/medical-bills-everything-you-need-to-know-about-your-rights/">PIRG website</a>, and legal and other help may be available from organizations like <a href="https://dollarfor.org/">Dollar For</a> and local legal aid groups.</p><div><p id="demand-better-from-community-leaders-and-elected-officials"><h3><strong>Demand better from community leaders and elected officials</strong></h3></p></div><p>There are better approaches to solving emergency medicine’s problems than by doing hand-to-hand combat with private equity’s worst practices. Reducing the overall harm requires change on a systemic level.</p><p><a href="https://hcp.hms.harvard.edu/people/zirui-song">Zirui Song</a>, a Harvard health economist and internist who studies private equity in health care, says those changes include better <a href="https://pirg.org/articles/the-ftc-is-cracking-down-on-big-healthcare-companies/">enforcement of the laws we have</a> aimed at preventing consolidation, fraud, and abuse; closing tax loopholes and other laws that allow private equity firms to conduct business while taking on minimal financial risk; and requiring transparency around private equity health care acquisitions and <a href="https://pirg.org/edfund/resources/post-the-price/">health care prices</a>. These are all subjects you can contact your elected officials about.</p><p>You can also ask to join the board of your local hospital, says McNamara. At nonprofit health systems in particular, these groups are required to include people from the community. As a member, you could learn more about how private equity works and say, “We don’t want private equity in our community.”</p></div><p><em>This story is supported by a grant from the National Institute for Health Care Management.
