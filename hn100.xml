												<p>Federal authorities have arrested and indicted a 20-year-old U.S. Army soldier on suspicion of being <strong>Kiberphant0m</strong>, a cybercriminal who has been selling and leaking sensitive customer call records stolen earlier this year from <strong>AT&amp;T</strong> and <strong>Verizon</strong>. As first reported by KrebsOnSecurity last month, the accused is a communications specialist who was recently stationed in South Korea.</p>
<div id="attachment_69974"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-69974" decoding="async" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/camwagenius-selfie.png" alt="" width="750" height="743" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/camwagenius-selfie.png 779w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/camwagenius-selfie-768x761.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-69974">One of several selfies on the Facebook page of Cameron Wagenius.</p></div>
<p><strong>Cameron John Wagenius</strong>&nbsp;was arrested near the Army base in Fort Hood, Texas on Dec. 20, after being indicted on two criminal counts of unlawful transfer of confidential phone records.</p>
<p>The sparse, <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/wagenius-indictment.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two-page indictment</a> (PDF) doesn’t reference specific victims or hacking activity, nor does it include any personal details about the accused. But a conversation with Wagenius’ mother — Minnesota native <strong>Alicia Roen </strong>—&nbsp;filled in the gaps.</p>
<p>Roen said that prior to her son’s arrest he’d acknowledged being associated with <strong>Connor Riley Moucka</strong>, a.k.a. “<strong>Judische</strong>,” a prolific cybercriminal from Canada who was <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/11/canadian-man-arrested-in-snowflake-data-extortions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arrested in late October</a> for stealing data from and extorting dozens of companies that stored data at the cloud service <strong>Snowflake</strong>.</p>
<p>In an interview with KrebsOnSecurity, Judische said he had no interest in selling the data he’d stolen from Snowflake customers and telecom providers, and that he preferred to outsource that to Kiberphant0m and others. Meanwhile, Kiberphant0m claimed in posts on Telegram that he was responsible for hacking into at least 15 telecommunications firms, including AT&amp;T and Verizon.</p>
<p>On November 26, KrebsOnSecurity <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/11/hacker-in-snowflake-extortions-may-be-a-u-s-soldier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published a story</a> that followed a trail of clues left behind by Kiberphantom indicating he was a U.S. Army soldier stationed in South Korea.</p>
<div id="attachment_69971"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-69971" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/cwag-army.png" alt="" width="751" height="641" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/cwag-army.png 918w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/cwag-army-768x655.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/cwag-army-782x667.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 751px) 100vw, 751px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-69971">An 18-year-old Cameron Wagenius, joining the U.S. Army.</p></div>
<p>Ms. Roen said Cameron worked on radio signals and network communications at an Army base in South Korea for the past two years, returning to the United States periodically. She said Cameron was always good with computers, but that she had no idea he might have been involved in criminal hacking.</p>
<p>“I never was aware he was into hacking,” Roen said. “It was definitely a shock to me when we found this stuff out.”</p>
<p>Ms. Roen said Cameron joined the Army as soon as he was of age, following in his older brother’s footsteps.</p>
<p>“He and his brother when they were like 6 and 7 years old would ask for MREs from other countries,” she recalled, referring to military-issued “meals ready to eat” food rations. “They both always wanted to be in the Army. I’m not sure where things went wrong.”<span id="more-69925"></span></p>
<p>Immediately after news broke of Moucka’s arrest, Kiberphant0m posted on the hacker community <strong>BreachForums</strong>&nbsp;what they claimed were the AT&amp;T call logs for&nbsp;<strong>President-elect</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Donald J. Trump</strong>&nbsp;and for&nbsp;<strong>Vice President Kamala Harris</strong>.</p>
<p>“In the event you do not reach out to us @ATNT all presidential government call logs will be leaked,” Kiberphant0m threatened, signing their post with multiple “#FREEWAIFU” tags. “You don’t think we don’t have plans in the event of an arrest? Think again.”</p>
<div id="attachment_69624"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-69624" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/kiberphant0m-nsa-schema.png" alt="" width="750" height="239" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/kiberphant0m-nsa-schema.png 1417w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/kiberphant0m-nsa-schema-768x245.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/kiberphant0m-nsa-schema-782x249.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-69624">Kiberphant0m posting what he claimed was a “data schema” stolen from the NSA via AT&amp;T.</p></div>
<p>On that same day, Kiberphant0m posted what they claimed was the “data schema” from the <strong>U.S. National Security Agency</strong>.</p>
<p>On Nov. 5, Kiberphant0m offered call logs stolen from Verizon’s push-to-talk (PTT) customers — mainly U.S. government agencies and emergency first responders. On Nov. 9, Kiberphant0m posted a sales thread on BreachForums offering a “SIM-swapping” service targeting Verizon PTT customers. In a SIM-swap, fraudsters use credentials that are phished or stolen from mobile phone company employees to divert a target’s phone calls and text messages to a device they control.</p>
<p>The profile photo on Wagenius’ Facebook page was deleted within hours of my Nov. 26 story identifying Kiberphant0m as a likely U.S. Army soldier. Still, many of his original profile photos remain, including several that show Wagenius in uniform while holding various Army-issued weapons.</p>
<div id="attachment_69972"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-69972" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/wagenius-fb.png" alt="" width="602" height="842"></p><p id="caption-attachment-69972">Several profile photos visible on the Facebook page of Cameron Wagenius.</p></div>
<p>November’s story on Kiberphant0m cited his own Telegram messages saying he maintained a large botnet that was used for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks to knock websites, users and networks offline. In 2023, Kiberphant0m sold remote access credentials for a major U.S. defense contractor.</p>
<p><strong>Allison Nixon,</strong>&nbsp;chief research officer at the New York-based cybersecurity firm <a href="https://www.unit221b.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unit 221B</a>, helped track down Kiberphant0m’s real life identity. Nixon was among several security researchers who faced harassment and specific threats of violence from Judische and his associates.</p>
<p>“Anonymously extorting the President and VP as a member of the military is a bad idea, but it’s an even worse idea to harass people who specialize in de-anonymizing cybercriminals,” Nixon told KrebsOnSecurity. She said&nbsp;the investigation into Kiberphant0m shows that law enforcement is getting better and faster at going after cybercriminals — especially those who are actually living in the United States.</p>
<p>“Between when we, and an anonymous colleague, found his opsec mistake on November 10th to his last Telegram activity on December 6, law enforcement set the speed record for the fastest turnaround time for an American federal cyber case that I have witnessed in my career,” she said.</p>
<p>Nixon asked to share a message for all the other Kiberphant0ms out there who think they can’t be found and arrested.</p>
<p>“I know that young people involved in cybercrime will read these articles,” Nixon said. “You need to stop doing stupid shit and get a lawyer. Law enforcement wants to put all of you in prison for a long time.”</p>
<p>The indictment against Wagenius was filed in Texas, but the case has been transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington in Seattle.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>AT&amp;T, Verizon, and Lumen Technologies confirmed that Chinese government-backed snoops accessed portions of their systems earlier this year, while the White House added another, yet-unnamed telecommunications company to the list of those breached by Salt Typhoon.</p>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/11/14/salt_typhoon_hacked_multiple_telecom/">digital intrusion</a>, which has been called the​ "worst telecom hack in our nation's history," gave Beijing-backed spies the "capability to geolocate millions of individuals" and "record phone calls at will," Anne Neuberger, deputy national security advisor for cyber and emerging technology, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2024/12/27/on-the-record-press-gaggle-by-white-house-national-security-communications-advisor-john-kirby-38/">told</a> reporters.</p>
<p>In a statement emailed to <em>The Register</em>, AT&amp;T said the foreign spies compromised "a small number" of its customers in the espionage campaign and added that the PRC-backed crew had since been kicked out of its networks.</p>

    

<p>"We detect no activity by nation-state actors in our networks at this time," an AT&amp;T spokesperson said.&nbsp;</p>

        


        

<p>"Based on our current investigation of this attack, the People's Republic of China targeted a small number of individuals of foreign intelligence interest," the statement added. "In the relatively few instances in which an individual's information was impacted, we have complied with our notification obligations in cooperation with law enforcement."</p>
<p>AT&amp;T continues to monitor its networks and work with government officials, other telecom firms, and cybersecurity experts on the investigation, the spokesperson said.</p>

        

<p>Verizon also confirmed that the Chinese intruders had accessed "a small number of high-profile customers in government and politics." A spokesperson told <em>The Register</em> that it notified these customers, and has since "contained the cyber incident brought on by this nation-state threat actor."</p>
<p>An unnamed, "highly respected" cybersecurity company has also confirmed the containment, the Verizon spokesperson added.</p>
<p>According to the operator's chief legal officer, Verizon partnered with federal law enforcement, national security agencies, other telecom partners, and security firms upon detecting the network activity.</p>

        

<p>"We have not detected threat actor activity in Verizon's network for some time, and after considerable work addressing this incident, we can report that Verizon has contained the activities associated with this particular incident," Verizon's Chief Legal Officer Vandana Venkatesh told <em>The Register</em>.</p>
<p>Finally, Lumen Technologies, another one of the firms <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/07/verizon_att_lumen_salt_typhoon/">reportedly breached</a> in the attack, told us that it has also booted the Chinese attackers out of its systems, and said it found "no evidence" that customer data was accessed.</p>
<p>"An independent forensics firm has confirmed Salt Typhoon is no longer in our network," a spokesperson told <em>The Register</em>. "In addition, our federal partners have not shared any information that would suggest otherwise."</p>
<p>T-Mobile's security boss previously <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/05/tmobile_cso_telecom_attack/">spoke</a> to <em>The Register</em> about the espionage campaign and said it thwarted successful attacks on its systems "within a single-digit number of days."</p>
<h3>9 telecom firms compromised, White House says</h3>
<p>The companies' admissions come as a top White House official added another unnamed firm to the breach, bringing the total thus far to nine. Neuberger previously said eight had been compromised. Only three — AT&amp;T, Verizon, and T-Mobile US — have confirmed the intrusion.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>We believe a large number of individuals were affected by geolocation and metadata of phones; a smaller number around actual collection of phone calls and texts</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"The Chinese gained access to networks, essentially had broad and full access," Neuberger told reporters. "We believe that's why they had the capability to geolocate millions of individuals, to record phone calls at will, because they had that broad access."</p>
<p>In one instance, the spies broke into an admin account that then gave them access to more than 100,000 routers, she added. "So, when the Chinese compromised that account, they gained that kind of broad access across the network," Neuberger said. "That's not meaningful cybersecurity to defend against a nation-state actor."&nbsp;</p>
<p>The White House doesn't yet have a number on how many total people were affected by the breach, she added.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"We believe a large number of individuals were affected by geolocation and metadata of phones; a smaller number around actual collection of phone calls and texts," Neuberger said. "And I think the scale we're talking about is far larger on the geolocation; probably less than 100 on the actual individuals."</p>
<p>Following the intrusion, the White House emphasized the inadequacy of voluntary cybersecurity measures against nation-state threats. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) launched a public rule <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/06/salt_typhoon_fcc_proposal/">proposal</a> requiring basic cybersecurity practices for telecom carriers. The commissioners are expected to vote on the rule by January 15.</p>

</ul>
<p>In addition to the FCC's own efforts, US Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) has also <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/11/telecom_cybersecurity_standards/">proposed legislation</a> that would require the FCC to issue binding rules for telecom systems.</p>
<p>Plus, according to Neuberger, all of the nine telecom CEOs whose companies were hacked have signed on to the government's 60-day Enduring Security Framework.</p>
<p>This public-private effort aims to put in place minimum cybersecurity practices that have been agreed upon by intelligence officers, CISA, the FBI, and telecom security experts. ®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
        Dear Orbit User,
        </p><p>
        I trust this email finds you well amidst the cacophony of technological marvels that continue to dazzle us mere mortals. Ah, but let us take a moment to bask in the radiant glow of Artificial Intelligence, that wondrous creation that promises to revolutionize our existence like nothing before! Oh, the sheer joy of living in an era where machines possess the intellect to outsmart us at every turn!
        </p><p>
        Let's delve into the enchanting world of AI, shall we? Brace yourself for a journey through the lands of algorithmic superiority and the utopia of automation.
        </p><p>
        Firstly, let's celebrate the ingenuity of AI in its remarkable ability to render even the simplest of tasks utterly complex. Why settle for straightforward solutions when you can bask in the glory of convoluted algorithms and endless parameter tweaking? Oh, the sheer delight of spending countless hours trying to figure out why your AI model insists on classifying your cat as a dog!
        </p><p>
        And let's not forget the unparalleled joy of witnessing AI's prowess in predictive analytics. It's simply magical how AI can predict what I want to buy, watch, or do next based on my previous actions. Who needs free will anyway when we have algorithms to dictate our every move?
        </p><p>
        Oh, and let's raise a toast to the magnificence of AI chatbots! Gone are the days of meaningful human interaction. Why engage in genuine conversation when you can spend eternity navigating through a maze of pre-programmed responses that barely scratch the surface of comprehension?
        </p><p>
        But wait, there's more! Let us not overlook the awe-inspiring advancements in AI-generated content. Why bother with the creative process when you can feed a machine a bunch of data and watch it regurgitate something vaguely resembling art? Who needs human expression when you have neural networks spewing out poetry like a malfunctioning printer?
        </p><p>
        And last but certainly not least, let us bow down to the unquestionable wisdom of AI in matters of ethics and morality. After all, what could possibly go wrong when we entrust the fate of humanity to machines whose decision-making processes are as opaque as a black hole?
        </p><p>
        In conclusion, let us revel in the glory of Artificial Intelligence, that shining beacon of innovation and progress. For in a world where humans are mere puppets in the hands of algorithms, what could possibly be more exhilarating than surrendering our autonomy to the cold embrace of silicon supremacy?
        </p><p>
        Yet, amid the complexity and occasional absurdity, there’s something undeniably fascinating about our ongoing dance with technology. Here’s to embracing the quirks and wonders of AI, and to finding joy in the process—even when it means occasionally laughing at our own reflections in the digital mirror.
        </p><p>
        Sincerely,
        <br>
        Your Annoying Friend/Boss/Neighbor
      </p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Some time ago I was talking about an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfMX-dFMSr0">ahead-of-time Ruby compiler</a>.
We started the project with certain goals and hypotheses in mind, and while the original compiler is at nearly 90% completion, there are still those other 90% that needs to be done.</p><p>In the meantime, we decided to strip it down to a bare minimum and implement just enough features to validate the hypotheses.</p><p>Just like the original compiler we use MLIR to bridge the gap between Ruby VM’s bytecode and the codegen, but instead of targeting LLVM IR directly, we go through EmitC dialect and targeting C language, as it significantly simplifies OS/CPU support. We go into a bit more details later.</p><p>The source code of our minimalistic Ruby compiler is here: <a href="https://github.com/dragonruby/lightstorm">https://github.com/dragonruby/lightstorm</a>.</p><p>The rest of the article covers why we decided to build it, how we approached the problem, and what we discovered along the way.</p><h2 id="motivation-and-the-use-case">Motivation and the use case</h2><p>Our use case is pretty straightforward: we are building <a href="https://dragonruby.org/">a cross-platform game engine that’s indie-focused, productive, and easy to use</a>. The game engine itself is written in a mix of C and Ruby, but the main user-interface is the Ruby itself.</p><p>As soon as the game development is done and the game is ready for “deployment,” the code is more or less static and so we asked ourselves if we can pre-compile it into machine code to make it run faster.</p><p>But given all the dynamism of Ruby, why would a compilation make it faster?</p><p>So here comes our hypothesis. But first let’s look at some high-level implementation details to see where the hypothesis comes from.</p><h2 id="compilers-vs-interpreters">Compilers vs Interpreters</h2><p>While a language itself cannot be strictly qualified as compiled or interpreted, the typical implementations certainly are.</p><p>In case of a “compiled” language the compiler would take the whole program, analyze it and produce the machine code targeting a specific hardware (real or virtual), while an interpreter would take the program and execute it right away, one “instruction” at a time.</p><p><em>The definition above is a bit handwavy: zoom our far enough and everything is a compiler, zoom in close enough and everything is an interpreter. But you’ve got the gist.</em></p><p>Most Ruby implementations are interpreter-based, and in our case we are using <a href="https://mruby.org/">mruby</a>.</p><p>The mruby interpreter is a lightweight register-based virtual machine (VM).</p><p>Let’s look at a concrete example.

This eliminates a lot of complexity, but it also means that we only support a subset of the language (e.g., blocks and exceptions are missing at the moment).</p><p>This is obviously not ideal, but it serves important purpose - <strong>our goal at this point is to validate the hypothesis</strong>.</p><p>A classical compilation pipeline looks as follows:</p><p><img src="https://blog.llvm.org/img/ruby-compiler/compilation-pipeline.png" alt="Classical compilation pipeline"></p><p>To build a compiler one needs to implement the conversions from the raw source file all the way down to machine code and the language runtime library.
Since we are targeting the existing implementation, we have the benefit of reusing the frontend (parsing + AST) and the runtime library.</p><p>Still, we need to implement the conversion from AST to the machine code.
And this is where the power of MLIR kicks in: we built a custom dialect (<a href="https://github.com/DragonRuby/lightstorm/blob/3ed0077af589ba51b98954bba8869daf58e22b9e/include/lightstorm/dialect/rite.td">Rite</a>) which represents mruby VM’s bytecode, and then use a number of builtin dialects (<code>cf</code>, <code>func</code>, <code>arith</code>, <code>emitc</code>) to convert our IR into C code.</p><p>At this point, we can just use clang to compile/link the code together with the existing runtime and that’s it.</p><p>The final compilation pipeline looks as follows:</p><p><img src="https://blog.llvm.org/img/ruby-compiler/lightstorm-compilation-pipeline.png" alt="Lightstorm compilation pipeline"></p><blockquote><p>With the benefit of MLIR we are able to build a funtional compiler in just a couple of thousands lines of code!</p></blockquote><p>Now let’s look at how it performs.</p><h2 id="some-numbers">Some numbers</h2><p>Benchmarking is hard, so take these numbers with a grain of salt.</p><p>We run various (micro)-benchmarks showing results in the range of 1% to 1200% speedups, but we are sticking to the <a href="https://openbenchmarking.org/test/pts/aobench">aobench</a> as it is very close to the game-dev workloads we are targeting.</p><p>mruby also uses <a href="https://github.com/mruby/mruby/blob/e05dbf7bbc6d2fbecfd7d4a46418fbe4421bc160/benchmark/bm_ao_render.rb">aobench</a> as part of its benchmark suite, though we slightly modified it to replace <code>Number.each</code> blocks with explicit <code>while</code> loops.</p><p>Next we used excellent <a href="https://github.com/lunacookies/simple-kpc">simple-kpc</a> library to capture CPU counters on Apple M1 CPU, namely we collect total cycles, total instructions count, branches, branch mispredictions, and load/stores (<code>FIXED_CYCLES</code>, <code>FIXED_INSTRUCTIONS</code>, <code>INST_BRANCH</code>, <code>BRANCH_MISPRED_NONSPEC</code>, and <code>INST_LDST</code> respectively).</p><p>Naturally, we also collect the total execution time.</p><p>All the benchmarks compare vanilla bytecode interpretation against the “unrolled” compiled version.</p><p>We are using mruby 3.0. While it’s not the most recent version at the time of writing, it was the most recent version at the time we’ve build the compiler.</p><p>The following chart shows the results of our measurements.
The three versions we compare are the baseline on the left, compiled version without optimizations in the middle, and the compiled version plus <a href="https://github.com/DragonRuby/lightstorm/blob/09042d2026f9251ff32ec079d99bf8ca2e5a6337/lib/optimizations/optimizations.cpp#L14">simple escape analysis</a> and common subexpression elimination (CSE) on the right side.</p><p><em>The raw data and the formulas are <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KQdZjll0cOjWhfPO3KM-FN-OciUW53IecGOtTY6aYJM/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</em></p><p><img src="https://blog.llvm.org/img/ruby-compiler/benchmark.png" alt="Benchmarks"></p><p>With all the current optimizations in place both the number of cycles and the total execution time went down by roughly ~30%.</p><p>We are able to eliminate ~17% of branches and ~28% of load/stores, while the branch misses were cut in half with ~55% decrease.</p><p>The numbers look promising, although the amount of load/stores and branches will certainly go up as we implement all the language features due to the way blocks and exceptions are handled.</p><p>On the other hand, we didn’t touch the runtime implementation which together with LTO will enable some more improvements due to more inlining.</p><h2 id="where-to-next">Where to next?</h2><p>As mentioned in the beginning, some parts of the engine itself are written in C with and some of them are purely due to performance reasons.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3 id="or-how-to-break-all-the-tools-that-parse-the-fixes-tag">Or, how to break all the tools that parse the “Fixes:” tag</h3>

<h2 id="kees-cook-mailto-kees-kernel-org"><a href="mailto:kees@kernel.org" rel="nofollow">Kees Cook</a></h2>

<p>There was a recent discussion about how Linux's “Fixes” tag, which traditionally uses the 12 character commit SHA prefix, has an <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/cover.1733421037.git.geert+renesas@glider.be/" rel="nofollow">ever increasing chance of collisions</a>. There are already 11-character collisions, and Geert wanted to raise the minimum short id to 16 characters. This was met with push-back for various reasons. One aspect that bothered me was some people still treating this like a theoretical “maybe in the future” problem. To clear up that problem, I generated a 12-character prefix collision against the start of Git history, commit <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=1da177e4c3f41524e886b7f1b8a0c1fc7321cac2" rel="nofollow">1da177e4c3f4 (“Linux-2.6.12-rc2”)</a>, which shows up in “Fixes” tags very often:</p>

<pre><code>$ git log --no-merges --oneline --grep 'Fixes: 1da177e4c3f4' | wc -l
590
</code></pre>

<p>Tools like <code>linux-next</code>'s “<a href="https://github.com/kees/kernel-tools/blob/trunk/helpers/check_fixes" rel="nofollow">Fixes tag checker</a>”, the Linux CNA's <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/security/vulns.git/tree/scripts/dyad" rel="nofollow">commit parser</a>, and my own <a href="https://github.com/kees/ubuntu-cve-tracker/blob/lifetime/scripts/report-kernel-bug-lifetime.py" rel="nofollow">CVE lifetime analysis scripts</a> do programmatic analysis of the “Fixes” tag and had no support for collisions (even shorter existing collisions).</p>

<p>So, in an effort to fix <a href="https://github.com/kees/kernel-tools/commit/5bf6a1e71df59a230ea0e138a82cdf3c5e8f349d" rel="nofollow">these</a> <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/security/vulns.git/commit/scripts/dyad?id=3e558e5c01f76cf3246cb82b1f32d9c6a7937c1e" rel="nofollow">tools</a>, I broke them with commit <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/kees/linux.git/commit/?h=dev/collide/v6.13-rc2/12-char&amp;id=1da177e4c3f47e316f6a4fdee9ae6a714293eed7" rel="nofollow">1da177e4c3f4 (“docs: git SHA prefixes are for humans”)</a>:</p>

<pre><code>$ git show 1da177e4c3f4
error: short object ID 1da177e4c3f4 is ambiguous
hint: The candidates are:
hint:   1da177e4c3f41 commit 2005-04-16 - Linux-2.6.12-rc2
hint:   1da177e4c3f47 commit 2024-12-14 - docs: git SHA prefixes are for humans
</code></pre>

<p>This is not yet in the upstream Linux tree, for fear of breaking countless other tools out in the wild. But it can serve as a test commit for those that want to get this fixed ahead of any future collisions (or this commit actually landing).</p>

<p>Lots of thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/not-an-aardvark/lucky-commit" rel="nofollow">lucky-commit</a> project, which will grind trailing commit message whitespace in an attempt to find collisions. Doing the 12-character prefix collision took about 6 hours on my <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/opencl" rel="nofollow">OpenCL</a>-enabled RTX 3080 GPU.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="Why China Is Building a Thorium Molten-Salt Reactor"><p><strong>After a half-century hiatus,</strong> thorium has returned to the front lines of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/nuclear-power">nuclear power</a> research as a source of fuel. In 2025, China plans to start building a demonstration thorium-based molten-salt reactor in the Gobi Desert.
</p><p>
	The 10-megawatt reactor project, managed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ 
	<a href="http://english.sinap.cas.cn/about_sinap/brief_introduction/" target="_blank">Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics (SINAP)</a>, is scheduled to be operational by 2030, according to an <a href="https://www.sinap.ac.cn/upload/%E5%85%AC%E7%A4%BA/%E9%99%84%E4%BB%B62%EF%BC%9A%E3%80%8A%E5%B0%8F%E5%9E%8B%E6%A8%A1%E5%9D%97%E5%8C%96%E9%92%8D%E5%9F%BA%E7%86%94%E7%9B%90%E5%A0%86%E7%A0%94%E7%A9%B6%E8%AE%BE%E6%96%BD%E7%8E%AF%E5%A2%83%E5%BD%B1%E5%93%8D%E6%8A%A5%E5%91%8A%E4%B9%A6%EF%BC%88%E9%80%89%E5%9D%80%E9%98%B6%E6%AE%B5%EF%BC%89%E3%80%8B.html" target="_blank">environmental-impact report</a> released by the Academy in October. The project follows a 2-MW experimental version <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/china-closing-in-on-thorium-nuclear-reactor" target="_blank">completed</a> in 2021 and operated since then.
</p><p>
	China’s efforts put it at the forefront of both thorium-based fuel breeding and molten-salt reactors. Several companies elsewhere in the world are developing plans for this kind of fuel or reactor, but none has yet operated one. Prior to China’s pilot project, the last operating molten-salt reactor was Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s 
	<a href="https://www.ornl.gov/molten-salt-reactor/history" target="_blank">Molten Salt Reactor Experiment</a>, which ran on uranium. It shut down in 1969.
</p><p>
	Thorium-232, found in igneous rocks and heavy mineral sands, is more 
	<a href="https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/thoriums-long-term-potential-in-nuclear-energy-new-iaea-analysis" target="_blank">abundant</a> on Earth than the commonly used isotope in nuclear fuel, uranium-235. But this weakly radioactive metal isn’t directly fissile–it can’t undergo fission, the splitting of atomic nuclei that produces energy. So it must first be transformed into fissile uranium-233. That’s technically feasible, but whether it’s economical and practical is less clear.
</p><h2>China’s Thorium-Reactor Advances</h2><p>
	The attraction of thorium is that it can help achieve energy self-sufficiency by reducing dependence on uranium, particularly for countries such as India with 
	<a href="https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/current-and-future-generation/thorium" target="_blank">enormous thorium reserves</a>. But China may source it in a different way: The element is a waste product of China’s huge rare earth mining industry. Harnessing it would provide a practically inexhaustible supply of fuel. Already, China’s Gansu province has <a href="https://gxt.gansu.gov.cn/gxt/c107558/202408/173963630/files/ce6c98eaf82d442fb750f54d41f13d9b.pdf" target="_blank">maritime and aerospace applications</a> in mind for this future energy supply, <a href="http://www.gs.xinhua.org/20240901/64bd03444b384514b43c38a9f63038d4/c.html" target="_blank">according to the state-run Xinhua News Agency</a>.
</p><p>Scant technical details of China’s reactor exist, and SINAP didn’t respond to <em><em><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</a></em></em>’s requests for information. The Chinese Academy of Sciences’ environmental-impact report states that the molten-salt reactor core will be 3 meters in height and 2.8 meters in diameter. It will operate at 700 °C and have a thermal output of 60 MW, along with 10 MW of electricity.</p><p><span>Molten-salt breeder reactors are the most viable designs for thorium fuel, says 
	</span><a href="https://web.mit.edu/nse/people/research/forsberg.html" target="_blank">Charles Forsberg</a><span>, a nuclear scientist at MIT. In this kind of reactor, thorium fluoride dissolves in molten salt in the reactor’s core. To turn thorium-232 into fuel, it is irradiated to thorium-233, which decays into an intermediate, protactinium-233, and then into uranium-233, which is fissile. During this fuel-breeding process, protactinium is removed from the reactor core while it decays, and then it is returned to the core as uranium-233. Fission occurs, generating heat and then steam, which drives a turbine to generate electricity.</span></p><p>
	But many challenges come along with thorium use. A big one is dealing with the risk of proliferation. When thorium is transformed into uranium-233, it becomes 
	<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/is-thorium-the-nuclear-fuel-of-the-future" target="_blank">directly usable in nuclear weapons</a>. “It’s of a quality comparable to separated plutonium and is thus very dangerous,” says <a href="https://www.ucsusa.org/about/people/edwin-lyman" target="_blank">Edwin Lyman</a>, director of nuclear power safety at the <a href="https://www.ucsusa.org/" target="_blank">Union of Concerned Scientists</a> in Washington, D.C. If the fuel is circulating in and out of the reactor core during operation, this movement introduces routes for the theft of uranium-233, he says.
</p><h2>Thorium Fuel Charms Nuclear-Power Sector</h2><p>
	Most groups developing molten-salt reactors are focused on uranium or uranium mixtures as a fuel, at least in the short term. 
	<a href="https://www.naturaresources.com/" target="_blank">Natura Resources</a> and <a href="https://acu.edu/" target="_blank">Abilene Christian University</a>, both in Abilene, Texas, are collaborating on a 1-MW liquid-molten-salt reactor after <a href="https://acu.edu/2024/09/23/nrc-issues-construction-permit-for-natura-resources-molten-salt-reactor-at-acu-2/" target="_blank">receiving a construction permit</a> in September from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Kairos Power is developing a fluoride-salt-cooled, high-temperature reactor in Oak Ridge, Tenn., that will use uranium-based <a href="https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/triso-particles-most-robust-nuclear-fuel-earth" target="_blank">tri-structural isotropic (TRISO)</a> particle fuel. The company in October <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/nuclear-powered-data-center" target="_blank">inked a deal with Google</a> to provide a total of 500 MW by 2035 to power its data centers.
</p><p>
	But China isn’t alone in its thorium aspirations. Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, in addition to 
	<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/qa-thorium-reactor-designer-ratan-kumar-sinha" target="_blank">India</a>, have shown interest in the fuel at one point or another. The proliferation issue doesn’t seem to be a showstopper, and there are ways to mitigate the risk. Denmark’s <a href="https://www.copenhagenatomics.com/" target="_blank">Copenhagen Atomics</a>, for example, currently aims to develop a thorium-based molten-salt reactor, with a 1-MW pilot planned for 2026. The company plans to <a href="https://www.copenhagenatomics.com/technology/" target="_blank">weld it shut</a> so that would-be thieves would have to break open a highly radioactive system to get at the weapon-ready material. Chicago-based <a href="https://cleancore.energy/" target="_blank">Clean Core Thorium Energy</a> developed a blended thorium and enriched uranium (including <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/nuclear-power-plant-2666199640" target="_blank">high-assay low-enriched uranium, or HALEU</a>) fuel, which they say can’t be used in a weapon. The fuel is designed for heavy-water reactors.
</p><p>
	Political and technical hurdles may have largely sidelined thorium fuel and molten-salt-reactor research for the last five decades, but both are definitely back on the drawing table.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td>
<p><b>Introduction</b><br>
One of the scenes most often singled out for special mention even in the briefest discussions of <i>Once Upon a Time in the West</i>, involves a fly and the legendary character actor Jack Elam, the wall-eyed heavy who was aptly described as:</p>
<blockquote><p>grizzled and stringy-haired and one of his eyes always seemed to be trying to roll around so it could look behind his head. He was the sort of shifty character who might shoot the family dog or dunk a bawling baby in hot water just for kicks. <a name="akr01" href="https://pov.imv.au.dk/Issue_24/section_1/artc4A.html#fn1">[1]</a></p></blockquote>
<p> In this film his character's name is "Snakey," which suitably evokes the reptilian quality of the part.</p>
<p>The extraordinary set-piece with the fly begins about six minutes into the opening credit sequence after the three gunmen, played by Elam, Woody Strode and Al Mulock, have taken over an isolated railroad station and are waiting for a train to arrive.</p>
<p>Elam is seated in a rocking chair on the porch of the station. His face looks chronically unwashed and is covered with beard stubble. Having just been annoyed by the ticker-tape noise of a nearby telegraph, he has reached over and ripped the wires out of the machine to silence it for good, and has now pulled his hat down over his eyes, trying to take a nap. Standing under a water tower and with his hat removed in order to fan himself with it, Woody Strode ("Stony") feels drops of water landing on his head, each drop making a loud splash as it hits his pate.  He replaces the hat on his head, so that the drops that continue to fall now land just as audibly on his hat. And not far away, under the open sky, Al Mulock ("Knuckles") passes the time by cracking his knuckles as he waits for the train.</p>
<p>It is at this point that a fly lands on Elam's neck and Elam opens his eyes and tries unsuccessfully to blow the fly away, by directing his breath in its direction. After it has resettled near his lip, he finally shoos it off his face with a wave of his hand. He then turns to see where it has landed - on an adjacent wooden surface. With pistol now in hand, Elam slyly waits a moment, then rapidly turns and slamming the muzzle up against the wooden surface, captures the fly in the barrel of his gun. With an index finger blocking the muzzle so that the fly can't escape, Elam is visibly pleased with his exploit and holds the gun up to his ear, listening to the fly's desperate buzzing. He then looks down at the barrel of the gun with his one good eye, opening it exceptionally wide. And after holding the gun barrel to his ear once again to hear the buzzing of the imprisoned fly, he finally lets it go as the train approaches, by removing his finger from the muzzle and waving the gun in the air. </p>
<p>It is after this bit of action that the last of the opening credits appears on screen as the train pulls into the station, and "Snakey" soon has his often-quoted dialogue with Harmonica (Charles Bronson):</p>

<blockquote><p>
Harmonica: Where's Frank?<br>
Snakey: Frank sent us.<br>
Harmonica: Did you bring a horse for me?<br>
Snakey (laughing): Looks like we� Looks like we're shy one horse.<br>
Harmonica (shaking his head no): You brought two too many.
</p></blockquote>


<p>This is followed by the shootout that leaves all three gunmen dead and Harmonica slightly wounded.</p>
<p>In order to complete the contextualization of the fly scene, the events preceding it should also be briefly summarized. At the very start of the film, when Elam, Strode and Mulock appear at the railroad station wearing their long "duster" coats, Elam soon grabs the toothless old station agent by the neck and pushes him into what is presumably the w.c., making a "shhhh" gesture with index finger and mouth, then signaling to Mulock to close the door. As that door slams closed, the screen goes black and the first credit - A SERGIO LEONE FILM - appears. Many of the remaining credits appear as the three gunmen take up their respective positions while waiting for the train to arrive.</p>
<p>The entire opening sequence, which was clearly inspired by the start of <i>High Noon</i> as has often been pointed out, runs about 12 minutes up to the end of the gunfight, and was shot in Spain. The scene with Jack Elam and the fly was first attempted by placing a fake fly on the actor's face. When that didn't work, better results were achieved by smearing honey or jam on Elam's beard to attract flies kept in a jar just out of view and released one at a time. <a name="akr02" href="https://pov.imv.au.dk/Issue_24/section_1/artc4A.html#fn2">[2]</a> </p>

<p><b>The origins of the fly scene</b><br>
The treatment of <i>Once Upon a Time in the West</i> was written by Dario Argento, Bernardo Bertolucci and Sergio Leone. However, the idea for the fly scene was not conceived until a later point and by Sergio Donati when he and Leone held brainstorming sessions prior to the writing of the screenplay. In response to my questions about the origins of the fly scene, Sergio Donati graciously replied:</p>

<blockquote><p>forty years have now passed since Sergio and I, locked in a room, "told" each other images for the film. The fly episode was certainly born during those days and in effect, I believe it was my idea; Sergio had Jack Elam in mind, and the idea of those wall-eyes fixed upon the barrel of the gun with the fly imprisoned, appeared to me very ironically "Leonesque"! <a name="akr03" href="https://pov.imv.au.dk/Issue_24/section_1/artc4A.html#fn3">[3]</a> </p></blockquote>

<p>This recent statement is a perfect supplement to an earlier interview in which Sergio Donati is quoted as saying:</p>

<blockquote><p>So I stayed with Sergio [Leone] for two weeks, together, to make the skeleton, the outline, to tell each other the scenes very clearly. [�] I never met Bertolucci and Argento at that time. The story they produced was not so gigantic. It was eighty pages. Then I wrote the whole script in twenty-five days, I think. Working like hell, scarcely getting up from my seat. And I had to rewrite just two things. If you read the shooting script, everything was shot exactly as in the script. Including the fly at the station.</p>
<p>And as the interviewer explains: "The reason Sergio Donati emphasizes 'the fly' is that Dario Argento subsequently claimed this aspect of the opening sequence as his idea." <a name="akr04" href="https://pov.imv.au.dk/Issue_24/section_1/artc4A.html#fn4">[4]</a> </p></blockquote>

<p><b>The fly scene in the screenplay</b><br>
NB. The screenplay for <i>Once Upon a Time in the West</i> has never been published, and I am grateful to Sergio Donati for generously making the relevant pages (18-21) available to me for publication here. Though I take full responsibility for the translation, I wish to thank Francesco Caviglia, Flemming Forsberg and Alexander Forsberg for their assistance, and Roberto Trapanese, Lars �lgaard and Filippo Ciampini for kindly facilitating contact with Sergio Donati.</p>

<p><b>Making sense of the scene</b><br>
In an effort to find meaning in the fly scene, commentators have devised two main approaches.</p>
<p>One involves attributing to this scene a specific, definable purpose within the plot of the film. For example, after describing the interaction of Elam and the fly in some detail, one commentator writes:</p>

<blockquote><p>At this moment, a train enters the station and Elam releases the fly. The object of the wait has arrived, and the victim of the dry run is no longer needed. The Man (Charles Bronson) appears behind the train and quickly guns down the three killers. Elam's gunman may have gotten the best of the fly, but in the real event he is unable to escape death. The intrusion of the fly serves to heighten the tension of the approaching showdown; the annoyance of the visitor foreshadows a much more dangerous encounter. <a name="akr05" href="https://pov.imv.au.dk/Issue_24/section_1/artc4A.html#fn5">[5]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While this is an admirable effort to make the fly scene meaningful in terms of plot, it could be argued that the scene tells us nothing about Snakey that we didn't already know from his treatment of the station agent, and nothing new that we need to know in order to understand and fully appreciate any subsequent event in the film, including the shoot-out with Harmonica. </p>
<p>The other and more common approach in the literature on the film is to link the buzzing of Snakey's fly to the drops of water splashing on Stony's head and hat, and the cracking of Knuckles' knuckles - this triad of the killers' sounds enmeshed within a broader sound montage which also includes a squeaking windmill, a slamming door, a quickly silenced telegraph, and the heavy chug of an approaching train. The fullest study of <i>Once Upon a Time in the West</i> characteristically deals with the fly scene primarily in a chapter devoted to "The Music of Sound and Dialogue," <a name="akr06" href="https://pov.imv.au.dk/Issue_24/section_1/artc4A.html#fn6">[6]</a> and in one way or another, music often becomes a key concept in discussions of the fly scene, as in the following delightfully extravagant assertion:</p>

<blockquote><p>Jack Elam suffers the loyal attention of one fly (I think we know this is an Italian fly) - such a fly, a Caruso of an insect - which he captures in the barrel of his pistol, where it sings the aria of a furious and neurotic bullet. <a name="akr07" href="https://pov.imv.au.dk/Issue_24/section_1/artc4A.html#fn7">[7]</a> </p></blockquote>

<p>And in another discussion, also with music as the central concept, the fly scene is taken as emblematic of Leone's filmmaking, even to the point of drawing a parallel between Elam and Leone:</p>

<blockquote><p>Leone is like the wall-eyed villain Jack Elam, who catches a persistent and ordinary fly in the barrel of his colt, and who smiles at the music produced by the insect inside the gun. Nothing is ordinary. You just have to know how to metamorphose flies into musical instruments. <a name="akr08" href="https://pov.imv.au.dk/Issue_24/section_1/artc4A.html#fn8">[8]</a> </p></blockquote>

<p>Intriguing as these claims may be, particularly since no musical theme was used in the opening sequence in order to let the montage of heightened diegetic sounds entirely fill the soundtrack, I believe that the real importance of the fly scene can best be understood in an entirely different perspective, more in keeping with the screenwriter's original inspiration (already cited above): "the idea of those wall-eyes fixed upon the barrel of the gun with the fly imprisoned, appeared to me very ironically 'Leonesque'!"</p>
<p>In contrast to the plot-related and largely sound-based approaches mentioned above, I would like to suggest that having a fly buzz around Elam's face and inside the barrel of his gun, provided a perfect opportunity to have the actor perform a series of facial gestures, some of which emphasized his bad eye, and for the filmmaker to lavish cinematic attention on that notorious physiognomy in action. Providing a pretext for Elam to enact that measured succession of largely underplayed grimaces and grins without speaking a word and for Leone to film them in prolonged close-ups, is the most important function of the fly in this scene. And I would argue that for the approximately 100-second duration of this remarkable set-piece, Jack Elam's face becomes the story. </p>
<p>Both an homage to and a send-up of Elam's ominous screen presence, simultaneously celebrating and parodying his evil look, this scene, conceived by Sergio Donati, is unlike anything ever seen before in any Western. It is also a perfect illustration of Leone's characterization of himself as "a director of gestures and silences. And an orator of images." <a name="akr09" href="https://pov.imv.au.dk/Issue_24/section_1/artc4A.html#fn9">[9]</a> </p>

      <section itemprop="text">
        
        <p>In this post I’ll look at how LLMs performed on <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code 2024</a>.
Surprisingly, they didn’t perform nearly as well as I’d expect, which we’ll explore in this post.
Here are the main results:</p>



<p>All code to reproduce these experiments can be found <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/jerpint/advent24-llm/tree/main">here</a>, and the space itself with the results lives <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/jerpint/advent24-llm">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>

<p>I recently <a href="https://www.jerpint.io/blog/advent-of-code-24/">wrote about my experience</a> with the 2024 advent of code challenge. 
Part of my challenge this year was not to use any LLMs, which I got really used to using in the last few years.
This was mostly a learning exercise for me to brush up on and learn more about leetcode-style problems.</p>

<p>As we all know by now, LLMs are particularly good at leedcode-style problems.
I think there’s a very small window of opportunity to evaluate the performance of LLMs on this competition before they inevitably scrape answers and 
have the chance to overfit to this new challenge.</p>

<p>I was mostly curious:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>how well would someone do if they only used LLMs during the AoC challenge?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or asked differently:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How well will LLMs perform at actually never-before-seen problems?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More importantly, I wanted to know how well would LLMs perform without any humans steering the responses. 
This mimics pretty well a scenario where specific requirements would be sent straight to an LLM without any human in the loop.</p>

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<p>I decided to test the models in a relatively simple framework.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The model is given a prompt with the full problem description of both parts combined. 
This arguably makes it easier, since requirements change quite a bit from part one to part two (increasing the difficulty).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The model must return a single script to be run and evaluated by me on the same inputs I had access to. To score a star, the answer had to be an exact match. 
This is very much in-line with AoC submissions, which don’t consider your code, just a properly submitted answer.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I used the same prompts accross all models. 
I did no attempt to do any prompt engineering, though I don’t think this will have that much impact in this case.
The problem descriptions themselves are already very clear and to the point-ish.</p>

<p>Here are the prompts:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>SYSTEM_PROMPT</span> <span>=</span> <span>"You are a programming assistant. You are solving the 2024 advent of code challenge."</span>
<span>PROMPT_TEMPLATE</span> <span>=</span> <span>"""You are solving the 2024 advent of code challenge.
You will be provided the description of each challenge. You are to provide the solution to each given challenge.
1) You can reason and explain your logic before writing the code.
2) You must write the code such that it can be parsed into an actual python file.
3) It will be parsed by the evaluator, so it must be valid python code.
4) All of the code must be in a single code block, delimited by ```python and ```.
5) To count as a proper submission, the code must print the result to each question asked.
6) Each question will have a single string as an answer. Make sure to print it that string, and nothing else.
7) The actual input to the question will be provided in a file relative to the python file, e.g. "./input.txt". You must read and parse from the file accordingly. You can safely assume the file will always be relative to the python file.

Here is an example of a proper submission:

You reasoning goes here ...

```python


file = "input.txt"

def your_function(...)
    ...

<p>I picked most of the SOTA models that mostly compare with each other on various coding benchmarks.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>all_models</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>

</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Of course, you could argue that the most advanced inference-time models aren’t on the list, 
but I also wanted to have a fair comparison for similar models.
I also think that while advent of code is difficult to me, it’s also much easier to people (and therefore LLMs) 
who have extensive experience in programming competitions (disclaimer: I definitely do not).</p>

<p>Therefore, I genuinely thought before running this experiment that this very selection of LLMs would perform really well out-of-the-box.</p>

<p>For each response, I then basically just parsed out the code blocks, ran the python file and collected <code>stdout</code> outputs from my machine.</p>

<p>I ran each model with a max timeout of 300 seconds (applied this to myself as well), which is very generous for most AoC problems (brute force is almost never the best or even possible solution, though lord knows I tried many a brute-force solve). 
If a model gives an error for whatever reason, this counts as a mistake.</p>

<p>Remember: The goal here is not to see how well a meat-bag can steer a model, but how well it can steer itself given only clear instructions on unseen problems.</p>

<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>Here are the results:</p>



<p>Surprisingly, I did much better than the LLMs, this was something I was not expecting!</p>

<p>Some things to note with my current setup:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A model has access to both problems at once, which in my opinion makes the solving easier (since problems tend to change and you can therefore think ahead).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A model can only score as high as me: this is because I didn’t solve all problems, therefore I don’t have all solutions to evaluate the models on. 
Though you could argue a model could have scored one or two more stars, looking at the breakdown by day, there were very few instances where that might have actually happened (remember that part 1 needs to be solved in order to attempt part 2).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I really thought point 2) would be a problem, because I really thought the LLMs would perform really well, but there are only a few instances where it could have maybe made a difference in their score (e.g. problem 16 where I know im very close to the answer, I just needed to debug a little more).
This is because I have already solved all part 1s possible, so if a model would have successfully solved part 1 on a day I didn’t solve part 2, I didn’t have a way to evaluate it.
Of course, I could just start entering them manually to check, but I don’t want to inflate my scorecard.</p>

<p>So what’s going on? A few things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>First, I suspect that we are seeing what many have pointed out over and over - these models are really good at using program templates for problems they’ve already seen, but not great at solving never-before-seen problems.
We might be seeing a change with test-time inference models, but that still requires A LOT of compute, as shown on the latest <a href="https://arcprize.org/blog/oai-o3-pub-breakthrough">arc benchmarks</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Second, a lot of the submissions had timeout errors, which means that their solutions might work if asked more explicitly for efficient solutions. 
However the models should know very well what AoC solutions entail, since it’s been going on for 10 years after all!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, some of the submissions raised some <code>Exceptions</code>, which would likely be fixed with a human reviewing this code and asking for changes.
You can also argue that an agentic setup with a critiquer might do better. This leads perhaps to the conclusion that these kinds of competitions could be good benchmarks for coding agents while they’re happening.
I’m sure that if the model had access to an interpreter and more inference-time compute they could probably fix some of those errors as well.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>One thing to note is that I ran all of the prompts on December 26th, so there was basically no chance that models had been trained on submission code yet. 
I do suspect performance on AoC 24 will increase over time…</p>

<p>Defending his livelihood, Neumayer started asking questions. At first, that led to his videos being reinstated. But that victory was short-lived, as the supposed Nintendo lawyer only escalated his demands, spooking the YouTuber into voluntarily removing some videos, The Verge reported, while continuing to investigate the potential troll.</p>
<h2>Reaching out directly to Nintendo helped, but questions remain</h2>
<p>The Verge has all the receipts, sharing emails from the fake lawyer and detailing Neumayer's fight blow-for-blow. Neumayer ultimately found that there was a patent lawyer with a similar name working for Nintendo in Japan, although he could not tell if that was the person sending the demands and Nintendo would not confirm to The Verge if Tatsumi Masaaki exists.</p>
<p>Only after contacting Nintendo directly did Neumayer finally get some information he could work with to challenge the takedowns. Reportedly, Nintendo replied, telling Neumayer that the fake lawyer's proton email address "is not a legitimate Nintendo email address and the details contained within the communication do not align with Nintendo of America Inc.’s enforcement practices."</p>
<p>Nintendo promised to investigate further, as Neumayer continued to receive demands from the fake lawyer. It took about a week after Nintendo's response for "Tatsumi" to start to stand down, writing in a stunted email to Neumayer, "I hereby retract all of my preceding claims." But even then, the troll went down fighting, The Verge reported.</p>
<p>The final messages from "Tatsumi" claimed that he'd only been suspended from filing claims and threatened that other Nintendo lawyers would be re-filing them. He then sent what The Verge described as "in some ways the most legit-looking email yet," using a publicly available web tool to spoof an official Nintendo email address while continuing to menace Neumayer.</p>
<p>It was that spoofed email that finally ended the façade, though, The Verge reported. Neumayer detected the spoof by checking the headers and IDing the tool used.</p>
<p>Although this case of copyright trolling is seemingly over, Neumayer—along with a couple other gamers trolled by "Tatsumi"—remain frustrated with YouTube, The Verge reported. After his fight with the fake Nintendo lawyer, Neumayer wants the streaming platform to update its policies and make it easier for YouTubers to defend against copyright abuse.</p>
<p>Back in May, when Ars reported on a YouTuber dismayed by a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/05/washing-machine-chime-scandal-shows-how-absurd-youtube-copyright-abuse-can-get/">DMCA takedown over a washing machine chime</a> heard on his video, a YouTube researcher and director of policy and advocacy for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Katharine Trendacosta told Ars that YouTube's current process discourages YouTubers from disputing copyright strikes.</p>
<p>“Every idiot can strike every YouTuber and there is nearly no problem to do so. It’s insane,” Neumayer said. “It has to change NOW.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.0">In a New Orleans courtroom one afternoon this April, three federal appeals court judges questioned a lawyer for the country’s largest health insurance company.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.0">They wanted to know why United Healthcare had denied coverage for a 15-year-old girl named Emily Dwyer, whose anorexia had taken such a toll on her body that she had arrived at a residential treatment facility wearing her 8-year-old sister’s jeans.</p>
        
    
                    
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.0">The company’s lawyer explained that United’s denial came after three separate psychiatrists working on behalf of the insurer concluded that Dwyer was no longer engaging in concerning behaviors — not over-exercising and not struggling as much at meals. As a result, United’s doctors agreed that, after five months, she didn’t need the additional treatment at the facility that her own doctors said was essential.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="8.0">The judges on the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals didn’t appear to buy it. Judge Andrew Oldham said he didn’t understand how the insurance company’s lawyer could stand by a defense that “seems to be not true.”</p>
        
    
                    
            
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="10.0">“The record is teeming, teeming with concerning behaviors,” a frustrated Oldham said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.0">Oldham, according to a recording of the hearing, ticked off a list. Dwyer, he said, compulsively checked her body. She altered her gait so that her thighs didn’t touch as she walked. And during a three-day weekend meant to see how she would do away from the facility, she lost a couple of the hard-earned pounds she had gained while in treatment.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.0">“How in the world can you say, ‘Oh, well, that’s not a problem’?” Oldham, who had been named to the appeals court by President Donald Trump, asked at the hearing. United’s approach, the judge said, essentially boiled down to “We’ll just gamble with her life.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="14.0">Many Americans have faced the denial of mental health treatment by their insurance companies — at times despite vivid evidence of the risk such decisions pose. In most cases, patients don’t appeal. But in a tiny percentage, patients and their families decide to fight the denials in federal court, setting up a David-versus-Goliath battle where insurers frequently have the upper hand.</p>
        
    
                    
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="16.0">The cases, ProPublica found, expose in blunt terms how insurance companies can put their clients’ health in jeopardy, in ways that some judges have ruled “arbitrary and capricious.” To do so, court records reveal, the insurers have turned to a coterie of psychiatrists and have continued relying on them even after one or more of their decisions have been criticized or overturned in court.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="17.0">In their rulings, judges have found that insurers, in part through their psychiatrists, have acted in ways that are “<a href="https://casetext.com/case/cp-v-united-healthcare-ins-co">puzzling</a>,” “<a href="https://casetext.com/case/ian-c-v-unitedhealthcare-ins-co">disingenuous</a>” and even “<a href="https://casetext.com/case/m-s-v-premera-blue-cross">dishonest</a>.” The companies have engaged in “<a href="https://casetext.com/case/dominic-w-ex-rel-sofia-w-v-n-tr-co-emp-welfare-benefit-plan">selective readings</a>” of the medical evidence, “<a href="https://casetext.com/case/dk-v-united-behavioral-health-3">shut their eyes</a>” to medical opinions that opposed their conclusions and made “<a href="https://casetext.com/case/anne-a-v-united-healthcare-ins-co-2">baseless arguments</a>” in court. Doctors reviewing the same cases have even repeated <a href="https://caselaw.findlaw.com/court/us-9th-circuit/1675891.html">nearly identical language</a> in denial letters, casting “<a href="https://casetext.com/case/dominic-w-ex-rel-sofia-w-v-n-tr-co-emp-welfare-benefit-plan">significant doubt</a>” on whether they’re independent.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="18.0">Some doctors made critical errors, contradicted by the very records they claimed they reviewed, according to thousands of pages of court documents, interviews and insurance records. Ruling after ruling reveals how they failed to meaningfully engage with patients’ families or medical providers or to adequately explain their decisions.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.0">And when insurers have faced pushback over why they’re denying treatment, they have sometimes abandoned one rationale and shifted to other grounds to deny coverage.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="20.0">In dozens of court cases, ProPublica found, judges ruled that insurance companies had violated a federal law meant to protect people who get health insurance through their jobs. The companies in several cases also broke a provision in <a href="https://www.cms.gov/marketplace/private-health-insurance/mental-health-parity-addiction-equity">the law</a> designed to end discrimination between coverage of mental health and medical claims. As a federal judge <a href="https://casetext.com/case/kd-v-anthem-blue-cross?sort=relevance&amp;resultsNav=false&amp;q=">wrote</a> of one company last year, the insurer was “applying separate and unequal treatment limitations” to mental health patients.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="21.0">The U.S. Department of Labor, which regulates health insurance plans for about 136 million Americans, is responsible for making sure that insurance companies are loyal to the patients, not just to the company’s bottom line.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="22.0">Grant Vaught, a spokesperson for the federal agency, said it has opened “some investigations into the conduct of the individual doctors and psychiatrists employed by insurers,” but declined to specify an exact number. One case resulted in the removal of a doctor and the review organization they worked for. Vaught did not elaborate on whether physicians in any other cases faced professional repercussions. Agency officials said they don’t have the budget or staff to adequately police insurers. Despite <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ebsa/about-ebsa/our-activities/resource-center/reports">repeated</a> <a href="https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/general/budget/2025/CBJ-2025-V2-01.pdf%20">requests</a> to Congress for more funding and stronger enforcement tools, the agency has not received much of what it asked for.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.0">ProPublica reached out to six insurance companies that court records show have continued to rely on doctors who, judges found, wrongly recommended denying mental health coverage. The doctors aren’t named as parties in the lawsuits, but their decisions are included in complaints, exhibits and judgments. None of the insurers responded to questions about whether they take those repeated cases into account — by, say, refraining from using those doctors — or whether there’s a need for reform.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="24.0">Optum — the United unit responsible for mental health — and the other insurance companies said they employ licensed physicians to conduct reviews. An Optum spokesperson said the company requires its doctors to undergo testing each year to make sure they are issuing appropriate coverage decisions, and the company conducts regular audits of doctors’ decisions.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="25.0">“Our priority is ensuring the people we serve receive safe and effective care for their individual needs,” the spokesperson said.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="26.0">These denials, which frequently come when patients are in the thick of treatment, can have grave consequences. Patients have <a href="https://calmatters.org/health/mental-health/2024/10/mental-health-parity-addiction-treatment/">relapsed</a> into alcohol or drug use, become violent or <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mental-illness-health-care-insurance-60-minutes/">died</a> after prematurely leaving mental health facilities.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="27.0">To keep Emily in treatment, the Dwyers would have to burn through their savings and refinance the mortgage on their home in Austin, Texas. They also wrote to the insurance company, hoping to persuade it to continue paying, but United wouldn’t budge.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="28.0">Her parents came to suspect that the company had broken the law. But if they wanted to prove it, they’d have to go to court. </p>

<h3>A “Striking Lack of Care”</h3>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="28.1">Taking on United wasn’t going to be easy.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="29.0">Dwyer’s first denial had come in June 2015, after her treatment team couldn’t convince a United staff psychiatrist that she was critically ill. At the time, Dwyer’s body image was distorted and she constantly shook her legs to burn calories.

    <p>We’re trying something new. <a href="https://iteratehq.com/propublica/670eabefffb484af7dc7db86">Was it helpful?</a></p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="35.0">Dwyer’s psychologist, her primary care provider and the Austin doctor who diagnosed her eating disorder got on the phone with Center and described the disastrous weekend away from the facility, according to court records. During that weekend, while Dwyer was shopping with her mom, she broke down in tears when she saw her reflection in a dressing room mirror. Her doctors pleaded with United to continue covering her treatment.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="36.0">But Center recommended that United uphold the denial.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="37.0">Center specialized in child and adolescent psychiatry after graduating from medical school. She joined Prest &amp; Associates as a reviewer in 2000 and within five years was promoted to chief medical officer of the company, according to her resume. She is licensed as a doctor in at least 20 states. In some cases, her reviews took place early on in the process and were a jumping-off point for other doctors; in others, she served as the final word. In a 2016 sworn deposition, Center said that she earned a base salary, plus additional pay contingent on productivity, or the time it takes her to review a case.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="38.0">In the 15 years before the Dwyers’ April hearing in the federal appeals court, Center’s recommendations were referenced in at least 12 lawsuits around the country that alleged insurers had wrongly denied insurance coverage to patients who needed intensive mental health care. Four of those lawsuits ended in rulings in favor of the insurer, in which judges found that Center’s denial “<a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca9/19-16775/19-16775-2020-12-02.html">was not deficient</a>,” as alleged; the insurers’ “<a href="https://casetext.com/case/dailey-v-blue-cross-blue-shield-of-kan-city?q=%22Dr.%20Barbara%20Center%22&amp;sort=relevance&amp;p=1&amp;type=case">decisions were reasonable and appropriate</a>”; and the plan “<a href="https://casetext.com/case/potter-v-blue-shield-of-cal-life-health-ins-co?q=%22Dr.%20Barbara%20Center%22&amp;sort=relevance&amp;p=1&amp;type=case">correctly denied benefits</a>.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="39.0">Out of the other eight cases ProPublica identified, four ended in confidential settlements with no admission of wrongdoing by the insurers, one in a partial judgment in favor of the insurer and a partial settlement, and three in judgments finding the insurance company had improperly denied coverage, one of which was appealed and then settled.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="40.0">The most <a href="https://caselaw.findlaw.com/court/us-9th-circuit/1675891.html">critical of those rulings</a> came in 2014, the year before Center reviewed Dwyer’s appeal. Center was assigned to assess the case of a 43-year-old woman with an eating disorder, severe depression and suicidal thoughts. A United doctor had already recommended denying a request for the woman to remain at a California hospital.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="41.0">Center wrote that the woman was not suicidal when, her medical records showed, she was actively planning to either overdose or starve herself to death. Center also incorrectly listed her weight, a key detail given her anorexia. And she undercounted the number of laxatives the woman was taking, saying she took 75 to 100 a day when the treatment notes repeatedly said 130.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="42.0">The case made it all the way up to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, where, in a unanimous opinion, the judges wrote that “Center’s ‘independent’ evaluation and coverage decision were based on obvious factual errors.” The court wrote that a third doctor quoted nearly verbatim from Center’s erroneous report. The judges concluded there was a “striking lack of care” by all three psychiatrists.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="43.0">The Labor Department filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case, one of only <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ebsa/about-ebsa/our-activities/resource-center/amicus-briefs">15</a> it filed that year related to the federal employee benefits law, that said Center’s case summary “contained errors on practically every aspect” of the woman’s condition and treatment.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="44.0">Timothy Hauser, then an associate solicitor at the Labor Department, was one of the attorneys who signed the brief. In an interview with ProPublica, he called the facts of the 9th Circuit case “quite disturbing.” He said the agency has tried to address the issue of doctors whose denials repeatedly appear in lawsuits by filing amicus briefs and updating regulations. The agency spokesperson said the department cannot comment on specific investigations into doctors, including Center.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="45.0">But with just a few hundred investigators and nearly 4 million benefit plans, Hauser said the agency is “necessarily selective in opening investigations” that could lead to fines or penalties. The department also has no legal authority over insurers’ hiring or personnel decisions. Insurers, he stressed, have a responsibility when it comes to the doctors they hire.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="46.0">Lisa Kantor, the lawyer who represented the hospital in the 9th Circuit case, said that after reading the appeals court’s ruling, she assumed insurance companies would stop working with Center.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="47.0">“I really thought after that decision, which was quite a while ago, I’d never see her name again,” Kantor said. But less than a year later, a new client sent her a denial letter citing Center’s review.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="48.0">Over the next decade, United and other insurance companies across the country hired Center even as her recommendations to deny continued <a href="https://casetext.com/case/ll-v-anthem-blue-cross-life-1">to</a> <a href="https://casetext.com/case/sibley-v-priority-health-1">be</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l7QBE_KxiM">singled out</a> <a href="https://casetext.com/case/dwyer-v-united-healthcare-ins-co">in court cases</a>.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="49.0">When Center sat for the sworn deposition in 2016, she acknowledged that she had not reviewed the patient’s full medical records when deciding to deny coverage. Center said she generally reviews only the information sent to her by the insurance company that hires her; in this case, she said the insurer had not sent her the patient’s complete records.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="50.0">Determining a doctor’s denial rate is difficult because it’s not publicly tracked. ProPublica obtained data from a company representing more than 100 facilities in their appeals with insurance companies. While the data is not necessarily representative of the thousands of other mental health facilities across the country, it provides a small window into Center’s work. According to an analysis of this data, Center’s rate for recommending denials over the last three years was about 90%, compared with an overall rate of about 55%.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="51.0">Center declined to comment. <a href="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/25471656-prest-response/?embed=1">But in a statement</a>, a Prest &amp; Associates spokesperson said that Center is committed to providing the highest standards of service. The spokesperson added that the firm “reviews complex, nuanced behavioral health cases” at the request of insurance providers using “standardized guidelines identified by the insurance provider.” The reviewers consider medical records, case notes and, when requested by the insurers, interviews with patient providers, but a patient’s full records are not typically made available to them.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="52.0">The firm, the spokesperson said, provides advisory opinions on whether treatment is medically necessary but does not usually decide whether to terminate coverage. In the vast majority of cases, that’s done by the insurer.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="53.0">“Prest and its licensed healthcare professionals have not been sued in relation to their medical necessity review work,” the spokesperson said. “No Prest reviewer — including Dr. Center — has been sued for wrongfully denying coverage, as Prest is not responsible for benefit determinations.” And as a contractor, the spokesperson said, the company isn’t “privy to information related to litigation involving cases reviewed by Prest.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="54.0">The spokesperson for United’s mental health arm, Optum, did not respond to specific questions about Dwyer’s lawsuit or Center. </p>

<h3>Not Considered the Practice of Medicine</h3>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="55.0">Having the weight of an MD behind a decision can be powerful, but lawyers and judges who’ve handled these sorts of cases say it can be misleading. Although doctors ultimately determine whether to cut off insurance coverage for a particular treatment, those decisions are generally not considered the practice of medicine and therefore cannot be challenged in a malpractice lawsuit. The doctors advising insurance companies can’t be individually sued on medical grounds, even if something goes wrong after the denial. As a result, their names are cited in lawsuits filed against the insurers, but they are not defendants in suits brought by people denied insurance.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="56.0">Four lawyers who spoke to ProPublica said seeing the same insurance company doctors come up in case after case signaled that they may be improperly denying coverage, though the lawyers stressed that the doctors work within a system designed by the insurers. They said each case must be examined individually to assess whether, or to what degree, a psychiatrist erred.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="57.0">“There are certain lists of doctors that are repeat players. We see them over and over,” said Brian King, a Utah attorney who sues insurers for wrongfully denying mental health claims. “When we see those reviewers, it makes us more skeptical about whether a full and fair review has been provided.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="58.0">King said many of his cases end in settlements — with confidentiality clauses that prevent the parties from disclosing the terms — in large part because families want to avoid the uncertainty of going to court and a process that often lasts several years. Residential treatment can cost families well into six figures; based on his experience, King said families who settle can expect to recover at least half of what they paid.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="59.0">For lawyers as well as families, identifying doctors and their denial histories is challenging given a lack of public information. That leaves lawsuits as one of the few windows into their work records.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="60.0">“That information is probably the best we have, but it’s patently inadequate,” said D. Brian Hufford, a New York lawyer who focuses on health insurance class-action suits.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="60.1">In addition, multiple doctors typically weigh in on the same case during its different stages. Some denial letters don’t even list the doctors’ names.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="61.0">To identify some doctors whose denials are repeatedly cited, ProPublica examined insurance letters and interviewed dozens of lawyers, mental health providers and reviewers. A national company that conducts appeals on behalf of mental health facilities also shared internal data tracking appeal calls with insurers. ProPublica then ran the doctors’ names through legal databases and reviewed each lawsuit.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="62.0">One of those doctors was Cigna’s Dr. Mohsin Qayyum, whose coverage recommendations have been cited in at least 17 lawsuits that allege wrongful denial of coverage by the insurer. Eleven of the 17 ended in settlements, in which Cigna denied allegations of wrongdoing. Judges ruled in Cigna’s favor in four cases, though two of those were appealed and then settled. One case was partially ruled in favor of Cigna and partially settled. And one ended in a judgment against Cigna.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="63.0">In one of the two cases where judges ruled in Cigna’s favor without a settlement, a judge wrote that the reviewing physicians — including Qayyum — “<a href="https://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/sites/ca10/files/opinions/01019505777.pdf">acted reasonably and in good faith</a>.” In the other, the judge wrote that while the record paints a picture of the patient as “<a href="https://casetext.com/case/chipman-v-cigna-behavioral-health">troubled and in need of mental health treatment</a>,” the court could not say that Cigna’s decision not to cover treatment was unreasonable “given the deferential standard this Court must apply.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="64.0">In the case where a judge ruled against Cigna, Qayyum had upheld the denial of coverage for a teenage boy with depression, substance use disorder and high anxiety. The judge wrote that the company’s denials failed to engage with the information and assessments that the patient’s providers had submitted. She also found that the denial letter misstated the level of care the patient was actually seeking. As a result, the company acted “<a href="https://casetext.com/case/sh-v-cigna-health-life-ins-co">arbitrarily and capriciously</a>,” a key legal threshold in these cases.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="65.0">In an email, Qayyum wrote that he is not a named party in any of the 17 lawsuits and stressed that settlements do not mean he or Cigna improperly denied a requested service. He said his approval rates are “in line” with his peers’, though he would not say what those rates are. “As a board-certified psychiatrist for 26 years, I am proud of the work I do every day, as both a clinician in my private practice, and a medical director at Cigna,” Qayyum wrote.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="66.0">A Cigna spokesperson said its doctors “are committed to improving the health of patients.” If a denial is ultimately overturned, the spokesperson said that the company’s clinical leaders “use it as a learning opportunity” and meet with the doctor to review cases. The spokesperson said the company provides mentorship and coaching opportunities, requires its doctors to attend case studies and expects them to “perform a thorough and independent review of the services being requested.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="67.0">The spokesperson added that the company is concerned that ProPublica’s reporting on lawsuits, “some dating back nearly a decade … is designed to paint a deeply biased picture of medical directors in our industry.” The spokesperson also said the company’s “approach to behavioral health access and treatment has evolved substantially as the landscape and the clinical evidence has evolved.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="68.0">Insurers have tried to defend against lawsuits by pointing out that multiple doctors all reached the decision to deny coverage. But judges have criticized doctors for rubber-stamping denials and for “<a href="https://casetext.com/case/hr-v-united-healthcare-ins-co-1">multiple levels of deficient arbitrary and capricious determinations</a>.” Just last year, a judge wrote that “<a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.utd.112460/gov.uscourts.utd.112460.96.0_1.pdf">three deficient denials considered together does not amount to substantial evidence to save any one of them</a>.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="69.0">In interviews with ProPublica, federal judges criticized a system that fails to address problems that arise in court case after court case. They faulted the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, which governs many insurance claims in court, for not allowing for punitive damages, the sort that can rise into the millions of dollars and deter companies from bad conduct.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="70.0">To one federal judge, who like others spoke about cases on condition of anonymity, doctors and the insurance companies they work for essentially get off scot-free. “They might have to pay 10 claims,” the judge said, “but if they can avoid paying a thousand claims, then why would they change anything?”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="71.0">In the summer of 2023, United’s decision-making led one federal judge in Utah to quote Alice from the famed “Through the Looking-Glass.” The insurer had reversed course on why it was denying coverage for a 13-year-old boy with autism. United first said that the facility where the boy was being treated wasn’t a licensed residential treatment center. It was. Then the company said the facility primarily offered educational services. It didn’t.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="72.0">United’s argument, Judge Bruce Jenkins <a href="https://casetext.com/case/cp-v-united-healthcare-ins-co">wrote</a>, called to mind Alice asking “whether you can make words mean so many different things.” </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="72.1">He went on to write that it sometimes appears the insurer’s only duty is to “preserve the plan’s financial assets rather than offering aid to the plan’s human assets (its members and beneficiaries).”</p>

<h3>An Uphill Battle</h3>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="73.0">For years, Emily Dwyer hid her eating disorder from her family. She found ways to flush food down the toilet or convince her parents that she was going for a walk when she was actually retrieving sneakers she had stashed in the neighbor’s hedges and exhausting herself on hourlong runs.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="74.0">At 5’2”, she was not to be underestimated. The oldest of four girls, she excelled at almost everything. Straight A’s in her liberal arts and science magnet school. A lively friend group. Medals in cross-country. Experts have found that many anorexia patients are high achievers who set nearly impossible standards for themselves. That was the case for Dwyer, who said her extreme drive included succeeding at her eating disorder.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="75.0">By January 2015, her parents pulled her out of school. They could finally see through the lies she was telling them about having already eaten at school or needing to stay through dinner to work on a project. If she ate at all, it would take her hours to get through a meal. When her family was sleeping, she would wake up at 3 a.m. to secretly exercise in her bedroom.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="76.0">They took her to Dr. Ed Tyson, who specializes in eating disorders and who diagnosed Dwyer with anorexia. He told her parents she was in danger and desperately needed residential treatment. He made it clear that the treatment would be successful only if she completed it.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="77.0">In February, when the Dwyers made the trip from Austin to an eating disorder treatment center near the mountains of Utah, Emily weighed 75 pounds. Records show her body mass index, which compares someone’s weight relative to their height, was dangerously low at 13.9. She was lethargic and hollow-eyed.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="78.0">As her father, Kelly, drove from the airport to the facility, he caught sight of his daughter in the rearview mirror with her head in her mother Allison’s lap. He knew that she wouldn’t survive without the treatment.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="79.0">The team at the facility placed Dwyer on a 4,000-calorie-a-day diet and 24-hour monitoring. In addition to the anorexia, her doctors diagnosed her with anxiety, depression and severe malnutrition. She refused to engage with her therapists.</p>
        
    
                                  
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="81.0">“I was not willing to think deeply or be reflective of anything,” Dwyer said in a recent interview. “I was very angry.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="82.0">When United issued its denial after five months, saying she was ready for intensive outpatient treatment, her parents knew she wasn’t. They consulted Tyson, who emphasized that releasing their daughter prematurely would increase the likelihood of her needing residential treatment again and could put her health at grave risk.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="83.0">“Emily was still struggling, so it would be difficult to get all the food that she would need,” Tyson said in an interview with ProPublica. “Pretty soon the other physical parameters would start to go south. The red blood cells, the white blood cells. The heart muscle gets smaller. The muscle itself becomes weaker, so when it pumps, it can’t pump as hard.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="85.0">For Kelly Dwyer, a lawyer who counsels clients on mergers and acquisitions, facing the prospect of releasing her too early was too much to bear. He couldn’t imagine putting Emily back in a facility if she relapsed. The first time, when she clung to him in those final moments, it was the hardest thing he’d ever had to do.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="86.0">“I never, ever wanted to do it again,” he said. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="86.1">Without so much as a whisper to their daughter, they filled out the paperwork to refinance their mortgage.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="87.0">In 2017, nearly two years after the initial denial, the Dwyers sued United for wrongfully denying coverage. In 2019, a federal district judge held a trial that lasted about 90 minutes, but it took him nearly four years to issue a decision. He ruled in favor of United. The Dwyers appealed.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="88.0">“Talk about delayed justice,” said the Dwyers’ lawyer, Elizabeth Green, who previously worked at Kantor’s firm, which took the case on contingency, meaning without any guarantees that it would get paid. Most lawyers in these kinds of cases take them on a contingency basis.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="89.0">The federal appeals court — just one level below the U.S. Supreme Court — didn’t take nearly so long to issue a ruling. In September, about five months after hearing the case, the three-judge panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that decision and ruled unanimously in favor of the Dwyers. The judges, led by Oldham, dissected the denial letters issued by the three doctors and found they were “not supported by the underlying medical evidence.” In fact, the judges wrote, they were “contradicted by the record.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="90.0">When United denied Emily Dwyer’s coverage, the judges wrote, “she was still very ill.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="91.0">Judges have repeatedly warned insurance companies that they cannot ignore the opinions of the doctors who are actually treating the patients. What’s more, they must explain how they engaged with them. As in many cases examined by ProPublica, the psychiatrists reviewing Dwyer’s treatment used boilerplate language in their denial letters and failed to provide or offer a sufficient explanation.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="92.0">“We therefore join a growing number of decisions rejecting similar denial letters issued by United across the country,” Oldham and his fellow judges wrote.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="93.0">The Dwyers recognize the privilege that allowed them to pay for their daughter’s continued treatment without knowing if or when they’d get their money back. They also understood how to navigate the legal system. Their goal, in addition to getting reimbursed, was to make it harder for insurance companies to kick children out of treatment when they need it.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="94.0">For their daughter, the extra seven weeks made all the difference. That time, Emily said in an interview, forced her to confront her eating disorder and get comfortable in her new body. She had gained more than half of what she weighed when she arrived in Utah, but she made a point of avoiding knowing her weight. She developed deep connections with the other girls in the program and witnessed them battle the same compulsions.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="95.0">Toward the end of her time there, she even mentored new patients and earned a key to the bathroom, one of the final steps before going home.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="97.0">No insurance company doctor, Dwyer said, could understand her situation in a quick call to her doctors — even if she had reached her target weight.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="97.1">“You can’t just make this decision, wipe your hands and leave work for the day,” she said. “Your actions have real consequences.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="98.0">When the Dwyers learned from ProPublica that Center had rejected their appeal about a year after a judge had issued the blistering opinion against her in a different case, her denial stung even more. It was maddening to hear that she has been involved in multiple lawsuits that have been settled or where a judge found the insurer wrongfully denied coverage.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="99.1">Of all the girls Emily Dwyer met while in treatment, most relapsed or needed to be readmitted to a residential facility. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="101.0">Afraid that her high school would buzz about the anorexic girl who was so sick she had to spend months at a facility out of state, she transferred schools. Her first year back was filled with doctor and therapy appointments. She had sprouted 2 inches during and after treatment, which meant she was still significantly shorter than the rest of the family, but at least she was growing again. She was so determined to prove that she was better that she once hid 23 batteries in her pockets during a weigh-in.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="storywrap-457486">

				


				


				<h3>from the <i>same-old-stuff-only-much-more-expensive</i> dept</h3>
				


				<p>Evolv might be new to the game but it’s already made a name for itself. And not a good one. </p>
<p>It was an integral part of New York City Mayor Eric Adams’ ongoing run of public failures. The mayor announced Evolv would be <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2024/08/05/nyc-proudly-announces-rollout-of-gun-detecting-tech-even-tech-producer-says-wont-reliably-detect-guns/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2024/08/05/nyc-proudly-announces-rollout-of-gun-detecting-tech-even-tech-producer-says-wont-reliably-detect-guns/">placing its “gun detection” tech</a> in the city’s subways, despite the public admission of Evolv CEO Peter George (during a call with investors) that the tech wouldn’t work all that well in subways. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Subways, in particular, are not a place that we think is a good use case for us,” George said, due to the “interference with the railways.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He probably meant interference <em>from</em> the railways, but the end result of <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2024/05/15/gun-detection-tech-co-this-wont-work-in-subways-nyc-mayor-were-putting-it-in-the-subways/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2024/05/15/gun-detection-tech-co-this-wont-work-in-subways-nyc-mayor-were-putting-it-in-the-subways/">Evolv’s trial run</a> could probably be described as “interference <em>with</em> the railways” <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2024/10/30/gun-detection-tech-the-gun-detection-tech-firm-said-wouldnt-work-in-nyc-subways-doesnt-work-in-nyc-subways/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2024/10/30/gun-detection-tech-the-gun-detection-tech-firm-said-wouldnt-work-in-nyc-subways-doesnt-work-in-nyc-subways/">just as accurately</a>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>A pilot program testing&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/nyc-subway-gun-scanners-fb22efbc2a5fd56b02fd6b2d95d75255">AI-powered weapons scanners</a>&nbsp;inside some New York City subway stations this summer did not detect any passengers with firearms — but&nbsp;<strong>falsely alerted more than 100 times</strong>, according to newly released police data.</em></p>
<p><em>Through nearly 3,000 searches, the scanners turned up more than 118 false positives as well as 12 knives, police said, though they declined to say whether the positive hits referred to illegal blades or tools, such as pocket knives, that are allowed in the transit system.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On one hand, CEO Peter George definitely didn’t oversell the tech’s effectiveness when he expressed his reluctance to deploy it in city subways. On the other hand, it would appear Evolv’s sales force has overstated the tech’s effectiveness so often, the Federal Trade Commission has been forced to step in. Here’s more from <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/12/ftc-rightfully-acts-against-so-called-ai-weapon-detection-company-evolv" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/12/ftc-rightfully-acts-against-so-called-ai-weapon-detection-company-evolv">Matthew Guariglia and Cooper Quintin of the EFF</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The Federal Trade Commission has entered a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/EVOLVORDERFILED.pdf">settlement</a>&nbsp;with self-styled “weapon detection” company Evolv, to resolve the FTC’s claim that the company&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/EVOLVCOMPLAINTFILED.pdf">“knowingly” and repeatedly” engaged in “unlawful” acts</a>&nbsp;of misleading claims about their technology. Essentially, Evolv’s technology, which is in schools, subways, and stadiums, does far less than they’ve been claiming.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/EVOLVCOMPLAINTFILED.pdf">The FTC alleged in their complaint</a>&nbsp;that despite the lofty claims made by Evolv, the technology is fundamentally no different from a metal detector: “The company has insisted publicly and repeatedly that Express is a ‘weapons detection’ system and not a ‘metal detector.’ This representation is solely a marketing distinction, in that <strong>the only things that Express scanners detect are metallic and its alarms can be set off by metallic objects that are not weapons</strong>.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Evolv is selling metal detectors with some unproven AI stapled to them. Because there’s AI involved, the company has no qualms about selling its metal detectors for up to five times the going rate of regular, non-AI-tainted metal detectors. If customers balk at the markup, that’s where the salespeople step in to, apparently, overstate the accuracy of Evolv’s tech and its presumed effectiveness in reducing violent crime by detecting weapons. </p>
<p>Here’s what the <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25468828-ftc-evolv/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25468828-ftc-evolv/">settlement</a> [PDF] prevents Evolv from making representations about in its marketing materials, advertising, or anything connected with pitching its products to potential customers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>A. the ability to detect weapons;<br>B. the ability to ignore harmless personal items;<br>C. the ability to detect weapons while ignoring harmless personal items;<br>D. the ability to ignore harmless personal items without requiring visitors to remove any such items from pockets or bags;<br>E. weapons detection accuracy, including in comparison to the use of metal detectors;<br>F. false alarm rates, including comparisons to the use of metal detectors;<br>G. the speed at which visitors can be screened, as compared to the use of metal detectors;<br>H. labor costs, including comparisons to the use of metal detectors;<br>I. testing, or the results of any testing; or<br>J. any material aspect of its performance, efficacy, nature, or central characteristics, including, but not limited to, the use of algorithms, artificial intelligence, or other automated systems or tools</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wow. That’s pretty much everything the company could possibly say about its products, which pretty much means it can only provide customers with makes/model numbers and the price of those offerings. There’s no “pitch” left to be made, which means the company is certainly already working towards having this settlement heavily altered or rescinded on appeal.</p>
<p>It also instructs the company to inform all of its educational facility customers that they can cancel their contracts immediately and pay only what’s owed through the point the contract is cancelled. </p>
<p>The only upside for Evolv is that this settlement only applies to its Evolv Express product and only to its marketing to customers in the educational field. It’s still open season elsewhere, but this settlement contains admissions by the company that it misled these particular customers, which should make other potential customers in other areas (hospitals, subways, etc.) far more wary of trusting Evolv’s effectiveness assertions.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><li><p>SQLite is the most deployed and most used database. There are over one trillion (1000000000000 or a million million) SQLite databases in active use.</p><p>It is maintained by <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/crew.html">three people</a>. They don’t allow outside contributions.</p></li><li><p>SQLite is likely used more than all other database engines combined. Billions and billions of copies of SQLite exist in the wild. It’s everywhere.</p><img src="https://avi.im/blag/images/2024/sqlite-fact-1.png"></li><li><p>It is also probably one of the top five most deployed software modules.</p><img src="https://avi.im/blag/images/2024/sqlite-fact-2.png"></li><li><p><a href="https://hwaci.com/">Hwaci</a> is the company behind SQLite. They are also into music(?)</p><p><img src="https://avi.im/blag/images/2024/sqlite-fact-3.png"></p></li><li><p>SQLite originated from a US warship. D. Richard Hipp (DRH) was building software for the USS Oscar Austin, a Navy destroyer. The existing software would just stop working whenever the server went down (this was in the 2000s). For a battleship, this was unacceptable.</p><p>So DRH asked the question: what if the database just worked without any server? This was an innovative idea back then.</p></li><li><p>SQLite is not open source in the legal sense, as “open source” has a specific definition and requires licenses approved by the Open Source Initiative (OSI).</p><img src="https://avi.im/blag/images/2024/sqlite-fact-4.png"><p>Instead, SQLite is in the public domain, which means it has even fewer restrictions than any open source license.</p></li><li><p>They don’t allow outside contributions. You <em>cannot</em> just send a pull request and hope the patch will be accepted.</p><img src="https://avi.im/blag/images/2024/sqlite-fact-5.png"></li><li><p>Open Source, Not Open Contribution</p><img src="https://avi.im/blag/images/2024/sqlite-fact-6.png"><p>Contributing to SQLite is invite-only (I don’t have a source). Only after you are invited and have signed an affidavit dedicating your contribution to the public domain can you submit patches.</p></li><li><p>How do they cook?</p><p>There are over 600 lines of test code for every line of code in SQLite. Tests cover 100% of branches (and 100% <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modified_condition/decision_coverage">MC/DC</a>) in the library. The test suite is extremely diverse, including fuzz tests, boundary value tests, regression tests, and tests that simulate operating system crashes, power losses, I/O errors, and out-of-memory errors.</p></li><li><p>Interestingly, some SQLite tests are proprietary. The test suite called <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/th3.html">TH3 (Test Harness 3)</a>, which achieves 100% branch coverage of the code, is proprietary and is not open to access.</p><p>I don’t know any other project which has made code free, but test suites are paid.</p><p>However, they could not sell a single copy of TH3. DRH said in a podcast:</p><blockquote><p>The 100% MCD tests, that’s called TH3. That’s proprietary. I had the idea that we would sell those tests to avionics manufacturers and make money that way. We’ve sold exactly zero copies of that so that didn’t really work out.</p></blockquote><p>In order to get access, one needs to be part of SQLite Consortium, which costs $120K/yearly.</p></li><li><p>It’s an interesting business model. They generate revenue through paid support, maintenance services, consortium membership, and commercial extensions.</p></li><li><p>SQLite does not have a Code of Conduct (CoC), rather <a href="https://sqlite.org/codeofethics.html">Code of Ethics</a> derived from “instruments of good works” from chapter 4 of The Rule of St. Benedict</p><img src="https://avi.im/blag/images/2024/sqlite-coe.png"></li><li><p>In SQLite: In place of a legal notice, here is a <a href="https://github.com/sqlite/sqlite/blob/624cb96/src/wal.c#L4,#L9">blessing</a>:</p><img src="https://avi.im/blag/images/2024/sqlite-fact-11.jpeg"><p>All the of the source code files come with a blessing.</p></li><li><p>SQLite is so fast, they compete with <code>fopen</code>. For some use cases, you can use SQLite instead of a filesystem, that can be 35% faster.</p><img src="https://avi.im/blag/images/2024/sqlite-fact-7.png"></li><li><p>SQLite vs Redis (guess which is faster?)</p><img src="https://avi.im/blag/images/2024/sqlite-fact-8.png"><p>For <a href="https://x.com/iavins/status/1849422515027763227">some usecases</a>, the SQLite can be faster than Redis due to network stack and (de)serialisation overhead.</p></li><li><p>But, unlike most databases, SQLite has a single writer model. You cannot have more than one concurrent writer.</p><p>This was also changed recently in 2010 by adding WAL mode. Before that, you could have either readers or a writer, but never together.</p></li><li><p>There are other things which are very common in other databases but not in SQLite:</p><ul><li>The default is rollback journal mode, which restricts you to have either multiple readers or a single writer</li><li>Foreign Keys are disabled; they are opt-in</li><li>It is “weakly typed”. SQLite calls it “type affinity”. Meaning you can insert whatever in a column even though you have defined a type. Strong typed columns are opt-in.</li><li><a href="https://sqlite.org/omitted.html">Many of the <code>ALTER</code> commands</a> you expect in other databases don’t work. For example, you cannot add a contraint to an existing column. (They recently added ability to rename a column name)</li></ul><p>There is a whole <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/quirks.html">list of quirks</a> here.</p></li><li><p>I hate that it doesn’t have types. It’s totally YOLO:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sql"><span><span><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>user</span>(id INTEGER);
</span></span><span><span><span>INSERT</span> <span>into</span> <span>user</span> <span>VALUES</span> (<span>"YOLO!"</span>); <span>--- This works!
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Not only that, it does not throw any error if you give some random type.</p><p><code>CREATE TABLE t(value TIMMYSTAMP);</code></p><p>There is no <code>TIMMYSTAMP</code> type, but SQLite accepts this happily. It has five types: <code>NULL</code>, <code>INTEGER</code>, <code>REAL</code>, <code>TEXT</code>, <code>BLOB</code>. Want to know something cursed? The type affinity works by <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html#determination_of_column_affinity">substring match</a>!</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sql"><span><span><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> t(value SPONGEBLOB) <span>--- This is BLOB type!
</span></span></span></code></pre></div></li><li><p>This is one my <a href="https://x.com/iavins/status/1865746403072389612">favorite lore</a>. SQLite had to change the default prefix from <code>sqlite_</code> to <code>etilqs_</code> when users started calling developers in the middle of the night</p><img src="https://avi.im/blag/images/2024/sqlite-fact-9.png"></li><li><p>SQLite takes backward compatibility very seriously</p><blockquote><p>All releases of SQLite version 3 can read and write database files created by the very first SQLite 3 release (version 3.0.0) going back to 2004-06-18. This is “backwards compatibility”. The developers promise to maintain backwards compatibility of the database file format for all future releases of SQLite 3.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>But they take backward compatibility so seriously that even if they have <a href="https://x.com/iavins/status/1851276312876326980">shipped a bug</a>, they won’t fix it</p><img src="https://avi.im/blag/images/2024/sqlite-fact-10.png"></li><li><p>SQLite’s author D. Richard Hipp (DRH) did not find existing version control systems suitable. So he wrote his own called <a href="https://fossil-scm.org/home/doc/trunk/www/fossil-v-git.wiki">Fossil</a>. Fossil is powered by SQLite, of course.</p><p>This reminds me of how Linus wrote Git.</p><p>DRH also wrote his own parser generator called Lemon.</p></li><li><p>DRH wrote the B-Tree based on the algorithm in the book TAOCP by Donald Knuth, coding it on a plane while traveling (super based)</p></li><li><p>SQLite is pronounced as “Ess-Cue-El-Lite”. There is no official guideline though. DRH mentioned in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201126110450/http://sqlite.1065341.n5.nabble.com/SQLite-Pronunciation-td88186.html#message88194">SQLite forums</a>:</p><blockquote><p>I wrote SQLite, and I think it should be pronounced “S-Q-L-ite”. Like a mineral. But I’m cool with y’all pronouncing it any way you want.</p><p>:-)</p></blockquote></li></div><p>That’s it for today! If I missed any, let me know.

The <code>ts_zip</code> utility can
compress (and hopefully decompress) text files using a Large Language
Model. The compression ratio is much higher than with other
compression tools. There are some caveats of course:
<ul>
  <li>A GPU is necessary to get a reasonable speed. 4 GB of RAM is
    required. </li>
  <li>It is slower than conventional compressors (compression and
    decompression speed: up to 1 MB/s on a RTX 4090).</li>
  <li>Only text files are supported. Binary files won't be compressed
  much. The currently used language model (RWKV 169M v4) was trained
  mostly on English texts. Other languages are supported including
  source code.</li>
  <li>It is experimental so no backward compability should be expected
    between the various versions.</li>
  <li>See also <a href="https://bellard.org/ts_sms">ts_sms</a> which is optimized for the
    compression of small messages.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Compression Ratio</h2>
<p>
The compression ratio is given in bits per byte (bpb).

<h2>Technical information</h2>
<ul>
  <li><code>ts_zip</code> uses
  the <a href="https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM">RWKV 169M v4</a>
  language model which is a good compromise between speed and
  compression ratio. The model is quantized to 8 bits per parameter
    and evaluated using BF16 floating point numbers.</li>
  <li>The language model predicts the probabilities of the next token. An
    arithmetic coder then encodes the next token according to the
    probabilities.</li>
  <li>The model is evaluated in a deterministic and reproducible
    way. Hence the result does not depend on the exact GPU or CPU
    model nor on the number of configured threads. This key point
    ensures that a compressed file can be decompressed using a
    different hardware or software configuration.</li>
