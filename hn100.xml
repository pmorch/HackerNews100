<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The medal and the diploma are the physical symbols confirming that an individual or organisation has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. The prize itself – the honour and recognition – remains inseparably linked to the person or organisation designated as the laureate by the Norwegian Nobel Committee. </p><div property="articleBody" id="body-37279"><p><span><span>A Nobel Peace Prize laureate receives two central symbols of the prize: a gold medal and a diploma. In addition, the prize money is awarded separately. Regardless of what may happen to the medal, the diploma, or the prize money, it is and remains the original laureate who is recorded in history as the recipient of the prize. Even if the medal or diploma later comes into someone else’s possession, this does not alter who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>A laureate cannot share the prize with others, nor transfer it once it has been announced. A Nobel Peace Prize can also never be revoked. The decision is final and applies for all time.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The Norwegian Nobel Committee does not see it as their role to engage in day-to-day commentary on Peace Prize laureates or the political processes that they are engaged in. The prize is awarded on the basis of the laureate' contributions by the time that the committee’s decision is taken.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The Committee does not comment on laureates’ subsequent statements, decisions, or actions. Any ongoing assessments or choices made by laureates must be understood as their own responsibility.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>There are no restrictions in the statutes of the Nobel Foundation on what a laureate may do with the medal, the diploma, or the prize money. This means that a laureate is free to keep, give away, sell, or donate these items.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>A number of Nobel medals are displayed in museums around the world. Several Nobel laureates have also chosen to give away or sell their medals:</span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><strong>Kofi Annan</strong> (Peace Prize 2001): In February 2024, his widow, Nane Annan, donated both the medal and the diploma to the United Nations Office in Geneva, where they are now permanently on display. She stated that she wished his legacy to continue inspiring future generations.</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><strong>Christian Lous Lange</strong> (Peace Prize 1921): The medal of Norway’s first Nobel Peace Prize laureate has been on long-term loan from the Lange family to the Nobel Peace Center in Oslo since 2005. It is now displayed in the Medal Chamber and is the only original Peace Prize medal permanently exhibited to the public in Norway.</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><strong>Dmitry Muratov</strong> (Peace Prize 2021): The Russian journalist sold his medal for USD 103.5 million in June 2022. The entire sum was donated to UNICEF’s fund for Ukrainian refugee children. This is the highest price ever paid for a Nobel Prize medal.</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><strong>David Thouless</strong> (Physics Prize 2016): His family donated the medal to Trinity Hall, University of Cambridge, where it is displayed to inspire students.</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><strong>James Watson</strong> (Medicine Prize 1962): In 2014, his medal was sold for USD 4.76 million. The controversial DNA researcher stated that parts of the proceeds would be used for research purposes. The medal was purchased by Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov, who later returned it to Watson.</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><strong>Leon Lederman</strong> (Physics Prize 1988): He sold his medal in 2015 for USD 765,002 to cover medical expenses related to dementia.</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><strong>Knut Hamsun</strong> (Literature Prize 1920): In 1943, the Norwegian author Knut Hamsun travelled to Germany and met with Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels. After returning to Norway, he sent his Nobel medal to Goebbels as a gesture of thanks for the meeting. Goebbels was honoured by the gift. The present whereabouts of the medal are unknown.</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><strong>Facts&nbsp;about&nbsp;the&nbsp;Gold Medal&nbsp;</strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The&nbsp;medal&nbsp;is&nbsp;cast&nbsp;in 18-carat gold,&nbsp;weighs&nbsp;196 grams, and&nbsp;measures&nbsp;6.6&nbsp;centimetres&nbsp;in diameter. It&nbsp;was&nbsp;designed&nbsp;by&nbsp;the&nbsp;Norwegian&nbsp;sculptor&nbsp;Gustav Vigeland in 1901. The&nbsp;obverse&nbsp;features&nbsp;a&nbsp;portrait&nbsp;of&nbsp;Alfred Nobel,&nbsp;while&nbsp;the&nbsp;reverse&nbsp;depicts&nbsp;three&nbsp;naked&nbsp;men&nbsp;with&nbsp;their&nbsp;arms&nbsp;around&nbsp;one&nbsp;another’s&nbsp;shoulders, symbolising&nbsp;fraternity. The Latin&nbsp;inscription&nbsp;pro pace et&nbsp;fraternitate&nbsp;gentium&nbsp;means&nbsp;“for&nbsp;peace&nbsp;and&nbsp;the&nbsp;fraternity&nbsp;of&nbsp;nations.”&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<em>The World is Ads</em></p>
<p>Here we go again, the tech press is having another AI doom cycle.</p>
<p>I've primarily written this as a response to an NYT analyst painting a completely unsubstantiated, baseless, speculative, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbG4P-AYzzA">outrageous, EGREGIOUS, preposterous</a> "grim picture" on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/13/opinion/openai-ai-bubble-financing.html">OpenAI going bust</a>.</p>
<p>Mate come on. OpenAI is not dying, they're not running out of money. Yes, they're creating possibly the craziest circular economy and defying every economics law since Adam Smith published 'The Wealth of Nations'. $1T in commitments is genuinely insane. But I doubt they're looking to be acquired; honestly by who? you don't raise $40 BILLION at $260 BILLION VALUATION to get acquired. It's all for the $1T IPO.</p>
<p>But it seems that the pinnacle of human intelligence: the greatest, smartest, brightest minds have all come together to... build us another ad engine. What happened to superintelligence and AGI?</p>
<p>See if OpenAI was not a direct threat to the current ad giants would Google be advertising Gemini every chance they get? Don't forget they're also capitalising on their brand new high-intent ad funnel by <a href="https://www.adweek.com/media/google-gemini-ads-2026/">launching ads on Gemini</a> and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-vp-says-ads-arent-coming-to-gemini-yet-why-2026-1">AI overview</a>.</p>
<p>Let's crunch the numbers.</p>
<h2>Quick Recap of OpenAI's 2025</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>March: Closed <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/30/softbank-openai-investment.html?&amp;qsearchterm=openai">$40B funding round at $260B valuation</a>, <em>the</em> largest raise by a private tech company on record.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes, OpenAI is burning <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/where-is-openais-money-going/">$8-12B in 2025</a>.
Compute infrastructure is obviously not cheap when serving 190M people daily.</p>
<h2>Predicting OpenAI's Ad Strategy</h2>
<p>So let's try to model their expected ARPU (annual revenue per user) by understanding what OpenAI is actually building and how it compares to existing ad platforms.</p>
<p>The ad products they've confirmed thus far:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://openai.com/index/our-approach-to-advertising-and-expanding-access/">Ads at bottom of answers</a> when there's a relevant sponsored product or service based on your current conversation</li>
</ul>
<p>Rollout:</p>
<ul>
<li>Q1 2026: Limited beta with select advertisers</li>
<li>Q2-Q3 2026: Expanded to ChatGPT Search for free-tier users</li>
<li>Q4 2026: Sidebar sponsored content + affiliate features</li>
<li>2027: Full international expansion, self-serve platform</li>
</ul>
<p>Testing starts "in the coming weeks" for logged-in adults in the U.S. on free and Go tiers.
Ads will be "clearly labeled and separated from the organic answer." Users can learn why they're seeing an ad or dismiss it.</p>
<p>Their principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Answer independence: Ads don't influence ChatGPT's answers</li>
<li>Conversation privacy: Conversations stay private from advertisers, data never sold</li>
<li>Choice and control: Users can turn off personalization and clear ad data</li>
<li>Plus, Pro, Business, and Enterprise tiers won't have ads</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://ossa-ma.github.io/images/xtodoubt.png" alt="We'll see about that"></p>
<p>They also mentioned a possibility of conversational ads where you can ask follow-up questions about products directly.</p>
<p><strong>Revenue targets:</strong> <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openais-ads-push-starts-taking-shape">Reports suggest</a> OpenAI is targeting $1B in ad revenue for 2026, scaling to $25B by 2029, though OpenAI hasn't confirmed these numbers publicly.
We can use these as the conservative benchmark, but knowing the sheer product talent at OpenAI, the funding and hunger. I think they're blow past this.</p>
<p>Personal speculations on integration:</p>
<ul>
<li>Self-serve platform: Advertisers bid for placements, super super super likely, exactly what Google does, probably their biggest revenue stream.</li>
<li>Affiliate commissions: Built-in checkouts so users can buy products inside ChatGPT, OpenAI takes commission, similar to their Shopify collab.</li>
<li>Sidebar sponsored content: When users ask about topics with market potential, sponsored info appears in a sidebar marked "Sponsored"</li>
</ul>
<p>Now let's compare this to existing ad platforms:</p>
<h3>Google: Intent + Vertical Integration = Highest Revenue</h3>
<ul>
<li>How it works: <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/142918?hl=en">Auction-based system</a> where advertisers bid on keywords. Ads appear in search results based on bid + quality score.</li>
<li>Why it works: High intent (search queries) + owns the entire vertical stack (ad tech, auction system, targeting, decades of optimization)</li>
<li>Ad revenue: [$212.4B in ad revenue in the first 3 quarters of 2025]<a href="https://www.demandsage.com/google-ads-statistics/">https://www.demandsage.com/google-ads-statistics/</a> (8.4% growth from 2024's $273.4B)</li>
<li>Google doesn't report ARPU so we need to calculate it: ARPU = $296.2B (projected) ÷ 5.01B = $59.12 per user annually.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Meta: No Intent + Vertical Integration = High ARPU</h3>
<ul>
<li>How it works: <a href="https://strikesocial.com/blog/facebook-feed-ads-meta-placements-efficiency/">Newsfeed ads</a> delivered via auction. Meta's Andromeda AI evaluates bid + predicted action rate + ad quality to determine placement.</li>
<li>Why it works: Passive scrolling = low purchase intent, but on a massive scale + owns targeting infrastructure + <a href="https://sociallyin.com/meta-statistics/">Andromeda AI</a></li>
<li>ARPU: <a href="https://en.macromicro.me/collections/4093/us-big-tech/32591/fb-arpu">$68.44 in North America</a>, <a href="https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/meta/metrics/average-revenue-per-user/">$49.63 globally</a> (Q1 2025)</li>
<li>Revenue: <a href="https://sociallyin.com/meta-statistics/">$160B in 2024</a> (97.3% of total revenue)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Twitter/X: Engagement + No Vertical Stack = Low ARPU</h3>
<ul>
<li>How it works: <a href="https://www.asclique.com/blog/twitter-advertising-guide-2025/">Auction-based promoted tweets</a> in timeline. Advertisers only pay when users complete actions (click, follow, engage).</li>
<li>Why it works: Timeline engagement, <a href="https://www.spiralytics.com/blog/x-twitter-ads-statistics-you-should-know/">CPC ~$0.18</a>, but doesn't own vertical stack and does it on a smaller scale</li>
<li>ARPU: ~$5.54 ($2.3B revenue ÷ <a href="https://marketingltb.com/blog/statistics/twitter-ads-statistics/">415M MAU</a>)</li>
<li>Revenue: <a href="https://marketingltb.com/blog/statistics/twitter-ads-statistics/">~$2.3B in 2025</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>ChatGPT: High Intent + No Vertical Stack = Where Does It Sit?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Intent level: High. <a href="https://www.demandsage.com/chatgpt-statistics/">2.5B prompts daily</a> includes product research, recommendations, comparisons. More intent than Meta's passive scrolling, comparable to Google search.</li>
<li>Vertical integration: None. Yet.</li>
<li>Scale: 1B WAU by Feb 2026, but free users only (~950M at 95% free tier).</li>
</ul>
<p>So where should ChatGPT's ARPU sit?</p>
<p>It sits with Search, not Social.</p>
<p>Which puts it between X ($5.54) and Meta ($49.63). OpenAI has better intent than Meta but worse infrastructure. They have more scale than X but no vertical integration.
When a user asks ChatGPT "Help me plan a 5-day trip to Kyoto" or "Best CRM for small business," that is High Intent. That is a Google-level query, not a Facebook-level scroll.</p>
<p>We already have a benchmark for this: <strong>Perplexity</strong>.</p>
<p>In late 2024/2025, reports confirmed Perplexity was charging <a href="https://www.dataslayer.ai/blog/perplexity-ai-for-marketing-should-you-advertise-on-ai-search">CPMs exceeding $50</a>.
This is comparable to premium video or high-end search, and miles above the ~$2-6 CPMs seen on social feeds.</p>
<p>If Perplexity can command $50+ CPMs with a smaller user base, OpenAI’s "High Agency" product team will likely floor their pricing there.</p>
<p><strong>Super Bullish Target ARPU Trajectory:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2026: $5.50 (The "Perplexity Floor") - Even with a clumsy beta and low fill rate, high-intent queries command premium pricing. If they serve just one ad every 20 queries at a Perplexity-level CPM, they hit this number effortlessly.</li>
<li>2027: $18.00 - The launch of a self-serve ad manager (like Meta/Google) allows millions of SMBs to bid. Competition drives price.</li>
<li>2028: $30.00 - This is where "Ads" become "Actions." OpenAI won't just show an ad for a flight; they will book it. Taking a cut of the transaction (CPA model) yields 10x the revenue of showing a banner.</li>
<li>2029: $50.00 (Suuuuuuuper bullish case) - Approaching Google’s ~$60 ARPU. By now, the infrastructure is mature, and "Conversational Commerce" is the standard. This is what Softbank is praying will happen.</li>
</ul>
<p>And we're forgetting that OpenAI have a serious serious product team, I don't doubt for once they'll be fully capable of building out the stack and integrating ads til they occupy your entire subconscious.</p>
<p>In fact they hired Fidji Simo as their "CEO of Applications", a newly created role that puts her in charge of their entire revenue engine.
Fidji is a Meta powerhouse who spent a decade at Facebook working on the Facebook App and... ads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Leading Monetization of the Facebook App, with a focus on mobile advertising that represents the vast majority of Facebook's revenue. Launched new ad products such as Video Ads, Lead Ads, Instant Experiences, Carousel ads, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Launched and grew video advertising to be a large portion of Facebook's revenue.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Being Realistic About Competition</h2>
<p>ChatGPT will hit <a href="https://www.sentisight.ai/when-chatgpt-reaches-1-billion-weekly-users/">1B WAU by February 2026</a>.</p>
<p>But 1.5-1.8B free users by 2028? That assumes zero competition impact from anyone, certainly not the looming giant Gemini. Unrealistic.</p>
<p>Let's estimate growth super conservatively accounting for competition:</p>
<ul>
<li>2026: 950M free users (1B WAU × 95% free tier)</li>
<li>2027: 1.1B free users (slower growth as market saturates)</li>
<li>2028: 1.2-1.3B free users (competition from Google, Claude)</li>
<li>2029: 1.4B free users (mature market, multi-player landscape)</li>
</ul>
<p>The main revenue growth comes from ARPU scaling not just user growth.</p>
<h2>Predicting 2026</h2>
<p>Crunching all the numbers from "High Intent" model, 2026 looks different.</p>
<p>Base revenue from subscriptions + enterprise + API: $25-30B</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.contentgrip.com/openai-chatgpt-subscription-strategy/">35M paying subscribers</a>: $8.4B minimum (conservatively assuming all at $20/mo Plus tier)</li>
<li>Definitely higher with Pro ($200/mo) and Enterprise (custom pricing)</li>
<li>Enterprise/API: <a href="https://www.finout.io/blog/openai-pricing-in-2026">$2.3B in 2025 → $17.4B by mid-2027</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Ad revenue (year 1): ~$5.2B</p>
<ul>
<li>950M free users x $5.50 ARPU</li>
<li>ChatGPT does 2.5B prompts daily this is what advertisers would class as both higher engagement and higher intent than passive scrolling (although you can fit more ads in a scroll than a chat)</li>
<li>Reality Check: This assumes they monetise typical search queries at rates Perplexity has already proven possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Total 2026 Revenue: ~$30-35B.</p>
<h2>Projecting 2027-2029</h2>
<p>These projections use <a href="https://futuresearch.ai/openai-revenue-forecast/">futuresearch.ai's base forecast</a> ($39B median for mid-2027, no ads) + advertising overlay from <a href="https://almcorp.com/blog/openai-chatgpt-advertising-strategy-2026/">internal OpenAI docs</a> + conservative user growth.</p>
<p><strong>2027:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Base revenue (no ads): $39B</li>
<li>Ad revenue: $19.8B (1.1B free users × $18 ARPU)</li>

<span>Plan 9 is a research operating system from the same group who created UNIX at
</span></a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150221121232/http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/alumni.html">Bell Labs Computing Sciences Research Center</a> (CSRC). It emerged in the late 1980s, and its early development coincided with continuing development of the later versions of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Unix">Research UNIX.</a> Plan 9 can be seen as an attempt to push some of the same ideas that informed UNIX

</i></span><span></span></a><span>into the era of networking and graphics.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pike">Rob Pike</a> has described Plan 9 as "an argument" for simplicity and clarity, while others have described it as "UNIX, only moreso."
</span></p>

<p>
<span>From
</span><span><i><a href="http://doc.cat-v.org/plan_9/4th_edition/papers/names">The Use of Name Spaces in Plan 9:</a> </i></span><span></span></p><ul>

<p>
<span>Plan 9 argues that given a few carefully implemented abstractions it
is possible to produce a small operating system that provides support
for the largest systems on a variety of architectures and networks.
</span></p>
</ul>


<p>
<span>From the
<a href="http://man.9front.org/1/intro"></a></span><a href="http://man.9front.org/1/intro"><span><tt>intro(1)
</tt></span><span></span></a><span>man page:
</span></p>

<ul>

<p>
<span>Plan 9 is a distributed computing environment assembled from
separate machines acting as terminals, CPU servers, and file
servers.  A user works at a terminal, running a window
system on a raster display.  Some windows are connected to
CPU servers; the intent is that heavy computing should be
done in those windows but it is also possible to compute on
the terminal.  A separate file server provides file storage
for terminals and CPU servers alike.
</span></p>
</ul>


<p>
<span>The two most important ideas in Plan 9 are:
</span></p>


<ul><span>•
<a href="http://doc.cat-v.org/plan_9/4th_edition/papers/names">private namespaces</a> (each process constructs a unique view of the hierarchical file system)
</span></ul>

<ul><span>•
<a href="http://man.9front.org/5/intro">file interfaces</a> (familiar from UNIX, but taken to the extreme: all resources in Plan 9 look like file systems)
</span></ul>


<p>
<span>Most everything else in the system falls out of these two basic ideas.
</span></p>


<ul><span><i>Plan 9 really pushes hard on some ideas that Unix has that haven't
really been fully developed, in particular, the notion that just about
everything in the system is accessible through a file.  In other
words, things look like an ordinary disk file.  So all the devices are
controlled this way by means of ASCII strings, not complicated data
structures.  For example, you make network calls by writing an ASCII
string, not the files.  This notion is something that's actually
leaking quite fast.
</i></span></ul>

<ul><span><i>The second thing is sort of more subtle and sort of hard to appreciate
until you've actually played with it.  That is that the set of files
an individual program can see depends on that program itself.  In a
standard kind of system, either with Unix remote file systems or
Windows attached file systems, all the programs running in the machine
see the same thing.  In Plan 9, that's adjustable per program.  You
can set up specialized name stations that are unique to a particular
program.  I mean, it's not associated with the program itself but with
the process, with the execution of the process.
</i></span><span></span></ul>

<span>In the words of the
</span></a><a href="https://9p.io/wiki/plan9/plan_9_wiki/fqa.html">Bell Labs Plan 9 wiki:</a> </p>

<ul>

<p>
<span>Plan 9 is not Unix.  If you think of it as Unix, you may become
frustrated when something doesn't exist or when it works differently
than you expected.  If you think of it as Plan 9, however, you'll find
that most of it works very smoothly, and that there are some truly
neat ideas that make things much cleaner than you have seen before.
</span></p>
</ul>


<p>
<span>Confusion is compounded by the fact that many UNIX commands exist on Plan 9 and behave in similar ways. In fact, some of Plan 9's userland (such as the
<a href="http://doc.cat-v.org/bell_labs/upas_mail_system"></a></span><a href="http://doc.cat-v.org/bell_labs/upas_mail_system"><span><tt>upas

<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170601063844/http://www.cs.bell-labs.com/10thEdMan">Research UNIX 10th Edition.</a> Further investigation reveals that many ideas found in Plan 9 were explored in more primitive form in the later editions of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Unix">Research UNIX.</a> </span></p>

<p>
<span>However, Plan 9 is a completely new operating system that makes no attempt to conform to past prejudices. The point of the exercise (circa the late 1980s) was to avoid past problems and explore new territory. Plan 9 is not UNIX
</span><span><i>for a reason.

</a><p><a name="0.1.1.1">
<span></span></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_user_space">Plan 9 from User Space</a> (also known as plan9port or p9p) is a port of many Plan 9 from Bell Labs libraries and applications to UNIX-like operating systems. Currently it has been tested on a variety of operating systems including: Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris and SunOS.
</p>

<p>
<span>Plan9port consists of a combination of mostly unaltered Plan 9 userland utilities packaged alongside various attempts to imitate Plan 9's kernel intefaces using miscellaneous available UNIX programs and commands. Some of the imitations are more successful than others. In all, plan9port does not accurately represent the experience of using actual Plan 9, but does provide enough functionality to make some users content with running acme on their Macbooks.
</span></p>

<p>
<span>It is now being
<a href="https://9fans.topicbox.com/groups/9fans/T15127d7ddd5c7310/sam-and-samterm-in-go">slowly ported</a> to the Go programming language.

Many users new to Plan 9 find out about Inferno and immediately decide to abandon Plan 9 and its opaque user interface for this obviously "more advanced" sibling, but usually abandon that, too, upon first contact with Inferno's Tk GUI. Notable exceptions duly noted.

<h3><span><b>0.1.4 - Plan 9 is not for you
</b></span><span></span></h3><span></span>

<p>
<span><b>Let's be perfectly honest.
</b></span><span>Many features that today's "computer experts" consider to be essential to computing (JavaScript, CSS, HTML5, etc.) either did not exist when Plan 9 was abandoned by its creators, or were purposely left out of the operating system. You might find this to be an unacceptable obstacle to adopting Plan 9 into your daily workflow. If you cannot imagine a use for a computer that does not involve a web browser, Plan 9 may not be for you.

<h2><span><b>0.2 - Why Plan 9?
</b></span><span></span></h2><span></span>

</a><p><a name="0.2">
<span>You may ask yourself, well, how did I get here? In the words of Plan 9 contributor
</span></a><a href="http://swtch.com/">Russ Cox:</a> </p>

<ul>

<p>
<span>Why Plan 9 indeed.  Isn't Plan 9 just another Unix clone?  Who cares?
</span></p>

<p>
<span>Plan 9 presents a consistent and easy to use interface.  Once you've
settled in, there are very few surprises here.  After I switched to
Linux from Windows 3.1, I noticed all manner of inconsistent behavior
in Windows 3.1 that Linux did not have.  Switching to Plan 9 from
Linux highlighted just as much in Linux.
</span></p>

<p>
<span>One reason Plan 9 can do this is that the Plan 9 group has had the
luxury of having an entire system, so problems can be fixed and
features added where they belong, rather than where they can be.  For
example, there is no tty driver in the kernel.  The window system
handles the nuances of terminal input.
</span></p>

<p>
<span>If Plan 9 was just a really clean Unix clone, it might be worth using,
or it might not.  The neat things start happening with user-level file
servers and per-process namespace.  In Unix, /dev/tty refers to the
current window's output device, and means different things to
different processes.  This is a special hack enabled by the kernel for
a single file.  Plan 9 provides full-blown per-process namespaces.  In
Plan 9 /dev/cons also refers to the current window's output device,
and means different things to different processes, but the window
system (or telnet daemon, or ssh daemon, or whatever) arranges this,
and does the same for /dev/mouse, /dev/text (the contents of the
current window), etc.
</span></p>

<p>
<span>Since pieces of file tree can be provided by user-level servers, the
kernel need not know about things like DOS's FAT file system or
GNU/Linux's EXT2 file system or NFS, etc.  Instead, user-level servers
provide this functionality when desired.  In Plan 9, even FTP is
provided as a file server: you run ftpfs and the files on the server
appear in /n/ftp.
</span></p>

<p>
<span>We need not stop at physical file systems, though.  Other file servers
synthesize files that represent other resources.  For example, upas/fs
presents your mail box as a file tree at /mail/fs/mbox.  This models
the recursive structure of MIME messages especially well.
</span></p>

<p>
<span>As another example, cdfs presents an audio or data CD as a file
system, one file per track.  If it's a writable CD, copying new files
into the /mnt/cd/wa or /mnt/cd/wd directories does create new audio or
data tracks.  Want to fixate the CD as audio or data?  Remove one of
the directories.
</span></p>

<p>
<span>Plan 9 fits well with a networked environment, files and directory
trees can be imported from other machines, and all resources are files
or directory trees, it's easy to share resources.  Want to use a
different machine's sound card?  Import its /dev/audio.  Want to debug
processes that run on another machine?  Import its /proc.  Want to use
a network interface on another machine?  Import its /net.  And so on.

</b></span><span></span></h3><span></span><br>
<img src="https://fqa.9front.org/belllabs.jpg">


<p>
<span>All of the people who worked on Plan 9 have moved on from Bell Labs and/or
no longer work on Plan 9. Various reasons have been articulated by various people.

<p>
<span>I ran Plan 9 from Bell Labs as my day to day work environment until
around 2002.  By then two facts were painfully clear.  First, the
Internet was here to stay; and second, Plan 9 had no hope of keeping
up with web browsers.  Porting Mozilla to Plan 9 was far too much
work, so instead I ported almost all the Plan 9 user level software to
FreeBSD, Linux, and OS X.
</span></p>
</ul>


<p>
<span>Russ Cox
<a href="http://marc.info/?l=9fans&amp;m=126697423223383">(again):</a> </span></p>

<ul>

<p>
<span>The standard set up for a Plan 9 aficionado here seems to
be a Mac or Linux machine running Plan 9 from User Space
to get at sam, acme, and the other tools.  Rob, Ken, Dave, and I
use Macs as our desktop machines, but we're a bit of an exception.
Most Google engineers use Linux machines, and I know of
quite a few ex-Bell Labs people who are happy to be using
sam or acme on those machines.  My own setup is two
screens.  The first is a standard Mac desktop with non-Plan 9
apps and a handful of 9terms, and the second is a full-screen
acme for getting work done.  On Linux I do the same but the
first screen is a Linux desktop running rio (formerly dhog's 8½).
</span></p>

<p>
<span>More broadly, every few months I tend to get an email from
someone who is happy to have just discovered that sam is still
maintained and available for modern systems.  A lot of the time
these are people who only used sam on Unix, never on Plan 9.
The plan9port.tgz file was downloaded from 2,522 unique
IP addresses in 2009, which I suspect is many more than
Plan 9 itself.  In that sense, it's really nice to see the tools
getting a much wider exposure than they used to.
</span></p>

<p>
<span>I haven't logged into a real Plan 9 system in many years,
but I use 9vx occasionally when I want to remind myself how
a real Plan 9 tool worked.  It's always nice to be back,
however briefly.

<a href="http://marc.info/?l=9fans&amp;m=126700061820789">continues:</a> </span></p>

<ul>

<p>
<span>&gt; Can you briefly tell us why you (Russ, Rob, Ken and Dave)
</span></p><p>
<span>&gt; no longer use Plan9 ?
</span></p><p>
<span>&gt; Because of missing apps or because of missing driver for your hardware ?
</span></p><p>
<span>&gt; And do you still use venti ?
</span></p>

<p>
<span>Operating systems and programming languages have
strong network effects: it helps to use the same system
that everyone around you is using.  In my group at MIT,
that meant FreeBSD and C++.  I ran Plan 9 for the first
few years I was at MIT but gave up, because the lack of
a shared system made it too hard to collaborate.
When I switched to FreeBSD, I ported all the Plan 9 libraries
and tools so I could keep the rest of the user experience.
</span></p>

<p>
<span>I still use venti, in that I still maintain the venti server that
takes care of backups for my old group at MIT.  It uses
the plan9port venti, vbackup, and vnfs, all running on FreeBSD.
The venti server itself was my last real Plan 9 installation.
It's Coraid hardware, but I stripped the software and had installed
my own Plan 9 kernel to run venti on it directly.  But before
I left MIT, the last thing I did was reinstall the machine using
FreeBSD so that others could help keep it up to date.
</span></p>

<p>
<span>If I wasn't interacting with anyone else it'd be nice to keep
using Plan 9.  But it's also nice to be able to use off the shelf
software instead of reinventing wheels (9fans runs on Linux)
and to have good hardware support done by other people
(I can shut my laptop and it goes to sleep, and even better,
when I open it again, it wakes up!).  Being able to get those
things and still keep most of the Plan 9 user experience by
running Plan 9 from User Space is a compromise, but one
that works well for me.

<ul>

<p>
<span>What Russ says is true but for me it was simpler. I used Plan 9 as my
local operating system for a year or so after joining Google, but it
was just too inconvenient to live on a machine without a C++ compiler,
without good NFS and SSH support, and especially without a web
browser.  I switched to Linux but found it very buggy (the main
problem was most likely a bad graphics board and/or driver, but still)
and my main collaborator (Robert Griesemer) had done the ground work
to get a Mac working as a primary machine inside Google, and Russ had
plan9port up, so I pushed plan9port onto the Mac and have been there
ever since, quite happily.  Nowadays Apples are officially supported
so it's become easy, workwise.
</span></p>

<p>
<span>I miss a lot of what Plan 9 did for me, but the concerns at work override that.

<p>
<span>The second edition, released in 1995 in book-and-CD form under a relatively standard commercial license, was available via mailorder as well as through a special telephone number for a price of approximately $350 USD. It was certainly easier to acquire than the first edition, but many potential users still complained that the price was too high and that the license was too restrictive.

trivial MIT-like license (the one used for other pieces of code, like the
one true awk) in 2003 instead of creating the Lucent Public License. Or in
2000 instead of creating the "Plan 9 License". Or in 1995 instead of as a
$350 book+CD that came with a license for use by an entire "organization".
Or in 1992 instead of being a limited academic release.

to release all Plan 9 software previously governed by the Lucent Public
License, Version 1.02 under the GNU General Public License, Version 2." But
the odds are overwhelming that the one-word answer is "lawyers".

<p>
<span>Some have suggested that confusion about licensing may have contributed to Plan 9's failure to supplant UNIX in the wider computing world.

<p dir="auto">Most websites today want to process your data and ask for consent using cookie banners. While these banners are meant to give you control, in practice they often result in repetitive and time-consuming clicks—especially if your browser clears cookies when you close it. The same banner reappears, and you find yourself making the same choices again and again.</p>
<p dir="auto">Consent-O-Matic is a browser extension designed to solve this problem. Developed by the Centre for Advanced Visualization and Interaction (CAVI) at Aarhus University, the tool automatically handles consent banners on your behalf. After you set your preferences during installation, Consent-O-Matic will recognize many common Consent Management Platform (CMP) banners, apply your choices, and confirm with a little checkmark next to the extension icon.</p>
<p dir="auto">Because Consent-O-Matic is an open-source project, anyone can contribute to its improvement by <a href="#extending-consent-o-matic">adding new rules, updating old rules</a>, or updating documentation. This collaborative approach ensures that the extension keeps pace with the constantly changing landscape of online consent banners—and makes it easier for everyone to safeguard their data with less hassle.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Compatible CMPs</h2><a id="user-content-compatible-cmps" aria-label="Permalink: Compatible CMPs" href="#compatible-cmps"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Consent-O-Matic currently works with more than 200 CMPs (see full list <a href="https://github.com/cavi-au/Consent-O-Matic/tree/master/rules">here</a>), including major platforms like UserCentrics, CookieBot, OneTrust, as well as cookie banners for specific websites.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Privacy</h2><a id="user-content-privacy" aria-label="Permalink: Privacy" href="#privacy"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Consent-O-Matic uses the following set of permissions in the browser when installed:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Access to read all pages - It searches each page you visit for consent-related popups that it knows how to handle</li>
<li>Information about tab URLs - You can turn the extension on/off on a page-by-page basis by clicking the icon. To check if it is enabled it needs to know the address of the page you are visiting</li>
<li>Storage - Your preferences and settings are stored directly in your browser</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The extension only communicates with the web in two situations:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>When fetching and updating rule lists</li>
<li>When you report a website as not working through the extension icon menu (the <strong>Let us know!</strong> button)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The URL of the website reported through the extension icon is <a href="https://github.com/cavi-au/Consent-O-Matic/blob/master/Extension/popup.js#L50">sent</a> to a website hosted by Aarhus University in the form of a URI-encoded query string (e.g., LinkedIn will be reported as <code>https://gdprconsent.projects.cavi.au.dk/report.php?url=www.linkedin.com</code>).</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation</h2><a id="user-content-installation" aria-label="Permalink: Installation" href="#installation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">We highly recommend installing directly through the official extension store of your browser (<a href="#consent-o-matic">mentioned at the top</a>). Installing through the official channels will automatically keep you up-to-date with new versions when they are released.</p>
<p dir="auto">It is also possible to get the extension by other means.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installing from Archived Release</h3><a id="user-content-installing-from-archived-release" aria-label="Permalink: Installing from Archived Release" href="#installing-from-archived-release"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">As an alternative to extension stores you can manually download and extract one of the published versions from the <a href="https://github.com/cavi-au/Consent-O-Matic/releases">Releases</a> page on Github.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you do that you have to use the developer feature of the browser to <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked" rel="nofollow">Load Unpacked</a> (Chrome) or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension#installing" rel="nofollow">Load Temporary Addon</a> (Firefox) and point it at the manifest.json in the unpacked zip-directory.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Building from Source</h3><a id="user-content-building-from-source" aria-label="Permalink: Building from Source" href="#building-from-source"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Lastly, if you intend to review or make changes to the code, you can build and install directly from the source code:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="git clone https://github.com/cavi-au/Consent-O-Matic.git
cd Consent-O-Matic
npm install"><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/cavi-au/Consent-O-Matic.git
cd Consent-O-Matic
npm install
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">and then run one of <code>npm run build-firefox</code> or <code>npm run build-chromium</code> or <code>npm run build-safari</code></p>
<p dir="auto">For Firefox or Chromium you can now proceed as above for installing release archives but point the browser at the <code>build</code> folder or a folder where you extracted the zip from build/dist/. Safari requires loading the XCode project to further build an app.</p>
<p dir="auto">We do not recommend installing from source.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Extending Consent-O-Matic</h2><a id="user-content-extending-consent-o-matic" aria-label="Permalink: Extending Consent-O-Matic" href="#extending-consent-o-matic"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">If your favorite CMP is missing from the current list, feel free to either create a custom list that you can add (click the extension icon in your browser, click "More add-on settings", click "Rule lists", and enter the URL of your custom list.). If you <strong>really</strong> want to contribute, feel free to create a Pull Request while you're at it.</p>
<p dir="auto">Users can send reports when rules for specific websites are not working. The full list of reported URLs is available <a href="https://gdprconsent.projects.cavi.au.dk/reports.php" rel="nofollow">here</a>. The number indicates how many times the URL was reported. This list currently does not show if/when the rules for a URL have been checked/adjusted, so always verify whether the rule is still broken/missing before you start working on it.</p>

<p dir="auto">A rule list for Consent-O-Matic is a JSON structure that contains the rules for detecting a CMP (Consent Management Provider), and
dealing with the CMP popup when it is detected.</p>
<p dir="auto">Each CMP is a named entry and contains 2 parts, <code>detectors</code> and <code>methods</code>. The name should ideally be the actual name of the underlying CMP (correctly capitalized and whitespaced) or of the website if it is unique to that domain. The name will be shown in the About section of extension's settings, so make it user-friendly.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="{
   &quot;MyCMP&quot;: {
      &quot;detectors&quot;: [ ... ],
      &quot;methods&quot;: [ ... ]

   &quot;AnotherCMP&quot;: {
      &quot;detectors&quot;: [ ... ],
      &quot;methods&quot;: [ ... ]

      <span>"methods"</span>: [ <span>... </span>]
   },
}</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">If more than 1 detector is added to a CMP, the CMP counts as detected if any of the detectors trigger.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Detectors</h4><a id="user-content-detectors" aria-label="Permalink: Detectors" href="#detectors"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Detectors are the part that detects if a certain rule set should be applied. Basically, if a detector triggers, the methods will be applied.</p>
<p dir="auto">Detector structure:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="{

   <span>"presentMatcher"</span>: [{ <span>... </span>}],
   <span>"showingMatcher"</span>: [{ <span>... </span>}]
}</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The present matcher is used to detect if the CMP is present on the page.</p>
<p dir="auto">Some CMPs still insert the popup HTML into the DOM even when re-visiting a page where you have already given consent earlier. We only want to handle the consent form if its actually showing on the page. This is what the showing matcher is used for.</p>
<p dir="auto">Both the present and showing matcher follow the common structure of <a href="#matchers"><code>Matchers</code></a>.</p>

<p dir="auto">There are 2 parts, <code>parent</code> and <code>target</code>. The <code>parent</code> is optional but if it exists it will be resolved first, and used as the starting point for <code>target</code>. This allows you to construct very complicated selections of elements that wouldn't otherwise be possible with a single plain CSS selector. One example of such is selecting into shadow DOM - where using parent to target the element with the shadow allows querying its children with the selector.</p>
<p dir="auto">All the parameters to <code>parent</code> and <code>target</code> except <code>selector</code> are optional.</p>
<p dir="auto">The selection method works by using the CSS selector from <code>selector</code> and then filtering the resulting DOM nodes via the various available filters:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>textFilter</code> filters all nodes that do not include the given text. It can also be given as an array <code>"textFilter":["filter1", "filter2"]</code> and then it filters all nodes that do not include one of the given text filters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>styleFilter</code> filters based on computedStyles. <code>option</code> is the style option to compare for example <code>position</code>, <code>value</code> is the value to compare against and <code>negated</code> sets if the option value should match or not match the given value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>displayFilter</code> can be used to filter nodes based on if they are display hidden or not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>iframeFilter</code> filters nodes based on if they are inside an iframe or not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>childFilter</code> is a fully new DOM selection, that then filters on the original selection, based on if a selection was made by <code>childFilter</code> or not.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Here is an example DOM selection:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="&quot;parent&quot;: {
   &quot;selector&quot;: &quot;.myParent&quot;,
   &quot;iframeFilter&quot;: true,
   &quot;childFilter&quot;: {
      &quot;target&quot;: {
         &quot;selector&quot;: &quot;.myChild&quot;,
         &quot;textFilter&quot;: &quot;Gregor&quot;
      }
   }
},
&quot;target&quot;: {
   &quot;selector&quot;: &quot;.myTarget&quot;
}"><pre><span>"parent"</span>: {
   <span>"selector"</span>: <span><span>"</span>.myParent<span>"</span></span>,
   <span>"iframeFilter"</span>: <span>true</span>,
   <span>"childFilter"</span>: {
      <span>"target"</span>: {
         <span>"selector"</span>: <span><span>"</span>.myChild<span>"</span></span>,
         <span>"textFilter"</span>: <span><span>"</span>Gregor<span>"</span></span>
      }
   }
},
<span>"target"</span>: {
   <span>"selector"</span>: <span><span>"</span>.myTarget<span>"</span></span>
}</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This selector first tries to find the <code>parent</code> which is a DOM element with the class <code>myParent</code> that is inside an iframe and has a child DOM element with the class <code>myChild</code> that contains the text "Gregor".</p>
<p dir="auto">Then, using this parent as "root", it tries to find a DOM element with the class <code>myTarget</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">This could then be the target of an action or matcher.</p>

<p dir="auto"><code>matcher</code> is the matcher used to check which state the consent is in. For a <a href="#checkbox">checkbox matcher</a>, the consent is given if the checkbox is checked. For a <a href="#css">CSS matcher</a> the consent is given if the matcher finds a DOM selection.</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>trueAction</code> and <code>falseAction</code> are actions used if consent instead has to be given by pressing one of two buttons, rather than being toggled on/off. These will be run depending on the user's selection of consent. If the user has given consent for this category type, the <code>trueAction</code> will be run, and <code>falseAction</code> will be run if the user has not given consent to this category type.</p>
<p dir="auto">If <code>toggleAction</code> and <code>matcher</code> is present on the content config, toggleAction will be used, if one of them is missing, <code>trueAction</code>/<code>falseAction</code> will be used instead.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><h2>Command-line Tools can be 235x Faster than your Hadoop Cluster</h2><h3 id="introduction"><a href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h3><p>As I was browsing the web and catching up on some sites I visit periodically, I found a cool article from <a href="https://tomhayden3.com/2013/12/27/chess-mr-job/">Tom Hayden</a> about using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce/">Amazon Elastic Map Reduce</a> (EMR) and <a href="https://github.com/Yelp/mrjob">mrjob</a> in order to compute some statistics on win/loss ratios for chess games he downloaded from the <a href="https://www.top-5000.nl/pgn.htm">millionbase archive</a>, and generally have fun with EMR. Since the data volume was only about 1.75GB containing around 2 million chess games, I was skeptical of using Hadoop for the task, but I can understand his goal of learning and having fun with mrjob and EMR. Since the problem is basically just to look at the result lines of each file and aggregate the different results, it seems ideally suited to stream processing with shell commands. I tried this out, and for the same amount of data I was able to use my laptop to get the results in about 12 seconds (processing speed of about 270MB/sec), while the Hadoop processing took about 26 minutes (processing speed of about 1.14MB/sec).</p><p>After reporting that the time required to process the data with 7 c1.medium machine in the cluster took 26 minutes, Tom remarks</p><blockquote><p>This is probably better than it would take to run serially on my machine but probably not as good as if I did some kind of clever multi-threaded application locally.</p></blockquote><p>This is absolutely correct, although even serial processing may beat 26 minutes. Although Tom was doing the project for fun, often people use Hadoop and other so-called <em>Big Data (tm)</em> tools for real-world processing and analysis jobs that can be done faster with simpler tools and different techniques.</p><p>One especially under-used approach for data processing is using standard shell tools and commands. The benefits of this approach can be massive, since creating a data pipeline out of shell commands means that all the processing steps can be done in parallel. This is basically like having your own <a href="https://storm-project.net/">Storm</a> cluster on your local machine. Even the concepts of Spouts, Bolts, and Sinks transfer to shell pipes and the commands between them. You can pretty easily construct a stream processing pipeline with basic commands that will have extremely good performance compared to many modern <em>Big Data (tm)</em> tools.</p><p>An additional point is the batch versus streaming analysis approach. Tom mentions in the beginning of the piece that after loading 10000 games and doing the analysis locally, that he gets a bit short on memory. This is because all game data is loaded into RAM for the analysis. However, considering the problem for a bit, it can be easily solved with streaming analysis that requires basically no memory at all. The resulting stream processing pipeline we will create will be over 235 times faster than the Hadoop implementation and use virtually no memory.</p><h3 id="learn-about-the-data"><a href="#learn-about-the-data">Learn about the data</a></h3><p>The first step in the pipeline is to get the data out of the PGN files. Since I had no idea what kind of format this was, I checked it out on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Game_Notation">Wikipedia</a>.</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>[Event "F/S Return Match"]
[Site "Belgrade, Serbia Yugoslavia|JUG"]
[Date "1992.11.04"]
[Round "29"]
[White "Fischer, Robert J."]
[Black "Spassky, Boris V."]
[Result "1/2-1/2"]
(moves from the game follow...)
</code></pre><p>We are only interested in the results of the game, which only have 3 real outcomes. The 1-0 case means that white won, the 0-1 case means that black won, and the 1/2-1/2 case means the game was a draw. There is also a <em>-</em> case meaning the game is ongoing or cannot be scored, but we ignore that for our purposes.</p><h3 id="acquire-sample-data"><a href="#acquire-sample-data">Acquire sample data</a></h3><p>The first thing to do is get a lot of game data. This proved more difficult than I thought it would be, but after some looking around online I found a git repository on GitHub from <a href="https://github.com/rozim/ChessData">rozim</a> that had plenty of games. I used this to compile a set of 3.46GB of data, which is about twice what Tom used in his test. The next step is to get all that data into our pipeline.</p><h3 id="build-a-processing-pipeline"><a href="#build-a-processing-pipeline">Build a processing pipeline</a></h3><p><em>If you are following along and timing your processing, don’t forget to clear your OS page cache as otherwise you won’t get valid processing times.</em></p><p>Shell commands are great for data processing pipelines because you get parallelism for free. For proof, try a simple example in your terminal.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>sleep <span>3</span> | echo <span>"Hello world."</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Intuitively it may seem that the above will sleep for 3 seconds and then print <code>Hello world</code> but in fact both steps are done at the same time. This basic fact is what can offer such great speedups for simple non-IO-bound processing systems capable of running on a single machine.</p><p>Before starting the analysis pipeline, it is good to get a reference for how fast it could be and for this we can simply dump the data to <code>/dev/null</code>.</p><p>In this case, it takes about 13 seconds to go through the 3.46GB, which is about 272MB/sec. This would be a kind of upper-bound on how quickly data could be processed on this system due to IO constraints.</p><p>Now we can start on the analysis pipeline, the first step of which is using <code>cat</code> to generate the stream of data.</p><p>Since only the result lines in the files are interesting, we can simply scan through all the data files, and pick out the lines containing ‘Results’ with <code>grep</code>.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>cat *.pgn | grep <span>"Result"</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This will give us only the <code>Result</code> lines from the files. Now if we want, we can simply use the <code>sort</code> and <code>uniq</code> commands in order to get a list of all the unique items in the file along with their counts.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>cat *.pgn | grep <span>"Result"</span> | sort | uniq -c
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This is a very straightforward analysis pipeline, and gives us the results in about 70 seconds. While we can certainly do better, assuming linear scaling this would have taken the Hadoop cluster approximately 52 minutes to process.</p><p>In order to reduce the speed further, we can take out the <code>sort | uniq</code> steps from the pipeline, and replace them with AWK, which is a wonderful tool/language for event-based data processing.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>cat *.pgn | grep <span>"Result"</span> | awk <span>'{ split($0, a, "-"); res = substr(a[1], length(a[1]), 1); if (res == 1) white++; if (res == 0) black++; if (res == 2) draw++;} END { print white+black+draw, white, black, draw }'</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This will take each result record, split it on the hyphen, and take the character immediately to the left, which will be a 0 in the case of a win for black, a 1 in the case of a win for white, or a 2 in the case of a draw. Note that <code>$0</code> is a built-in variable that represents the entire record.</p><p>This reduces the running time to approximately 65 seconds, and since we’re processing twice as much data this is a speedup of around 47 times.</p><p>So even at this point we already have a speedup of around 47 with a naive local solution. Additionally, the memory usage is effectively zero since the only data stored is the actual counts, and incrementing 3 integers is almost free in memory space terms. However, looking at <code>htop</code> while this is running shows that <code>grep</code> is currently the bottleneck with full usage of a single CPU core.</p><h3 id="parallelize-the-bottlenecks"><a href="#parallelize-the-bottlenecks">Parallelize the bottlenecks</a></h3><p>This problem of unused cores can be fixed with the wonderful <code>xargs</code> command, which will allow us to parallelize the <code>grep</code>. Since <code>xargs</code> expects input in a certain way, it is safer and easier to use <code>find</code> with the <code>-print0</code> argument in order to make sure that each file name being passed to <code>xargs</code> is null-terminated. The corresponding <code>-0</code> tells <code>xargs</code> to expected null-terminated input. Additionally, the <code>-n</code> how many inputs to give each process and the <code>-P</code> indicates the number of processes to run in parallel. Also important to be aware of is that such a parallel pipeline doesn’t guarantee delivery order, but this isn’t a problem if you are used to dealing with distributed processing systems. The <code>-F</code> for <code>grep</code> indicates that we are only matching on fixed strings and not doing any fancy regex, and can offer a small speedup, which I did not notice in my testing.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>find . -type f -name <span>'*.pgn'</span> -print0 | xargs -0 -n1 -P4 grep -F <span>"Result"</span> | gawk <span>'{ split($0, a, "-"); res = substr(a[1], length(a[1]), 1); if (res == 1) white++; if (res == 0) black++; if (res == 2) draw++;} END { print NR, white, black, draw }'</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This results in a run time of about 38 seconds, which is an additional 40% or so reduction in processing time from parallelizing the <code>grep</code> step in our pipeline. This gets us up to approximately 77 times faster than the Hadoop implementation.</p><p>Although we have improved the performance dramatically by parallelizing the <code>grep</code> step in our pipeline, we can actually remove this entirely by having <code>awk</code> filter the input records (lines in this case) and only operate on those containing the string “Result”.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>find . -type f -name <span>'*.pgn'</span> -print0 | xargs -0 -n1 -P4 awk <span>'/Result/ { split($0, a, "-"); res = substr(a[1], length(a[1]), 1); if (res == 1) white++; if (res == 0) black++; if (res == 2) draw++;} END { print white+black+draw, white, black, draw }'</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>You may think that would be the correct solution, but this will output the results of <strong>each</strong> file individually, when we want to aggregate them all together. The resulting correct implementation is conceptually very similar to what the MapReduce implementation would be.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>find . -type f -name <span>'*.pgn'</span> -print0 | xargs -0 -n4 -P4 awk <span>'/Result/ { split($0, a, "-"); res = substr(a[1], length(a[1]), 1); if (res == 1) white++; if (res == 0) black++; if (res == 2) draw++ } END { print white+black+draw, white, black, draw }'</span> | awk <span>'{games += $1; white += $2; black += $3; draw += $4; } END { print games, white, black, draw }'</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>By adding the second awk step at the end, we obtain the aggregated game information as desired.</p><p>This further improves the speed dramatically, achieving a running time of about 18 seconds, or about 174 times faster than the Hadoop implementation.</p><p>However, we can make it a bit faster still by using <a href="https://invisible-island.net/mawk/mawk.html">mawk</a>, which is often a drop-in replacement for <code>gawk</code> and can offer better performance.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>find . -type f -name <span>'*.pgn'</span> -print0 | xargs -0 -n4 -P4 mawk <span>'/Result/ { split($0, a, "-"); res = substr(a[1], length(a[1]), 1); if (res == 1) white++; if (res == 0) black++; if (res == 2) draw++ } END { print white+black+draw, white, black, draw }'</span> | mawk <span>'{games += $1; white += $2; black += $3; draw += $4; } END { print games, white, black, draw }'</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This <code>find | xargs mawk | mawk</code> pipeline gets us down to a runtime of about 12 seconds, or about 270MB/sec, which is around 235 times faster than the Hadoop implementation.</p><h3 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h3><p>Hopefully this has illustrated some points about using and abusing tools like Hadoop for data processing tasks that can better be accomplished on a single machine with simple shell commands and tools. If you have a huge amount of data or really need distributed processing, then tools like Hadoop may be required, but more often than not these days I see Hadoop used where a traditional relational database or other solutions would be far better in terms of performance, cost of implementation, and ongoing maintenance.</p><a href="https://brid.gy/publish/mastodon"></a><a href="https://brid.gy/publish/twitter"></a><a href="https://fed.brid.gy/"></a><data value="false"></data></article></div>]]></description>

    <p>Delivering Results</p>
    <p>Design is far more than form or function. It’s the tangible expression of a brand’s identity, values, and promise. While a brand defines what a company stands for, design gives those aspirations form and substance. Design uniquely delivers value: visually, physically, and experientially.</p>
    <p>At ThinkNext Design, every creation begins with empathy and seeks purpose. We look to understand not just what people need, but what they desire. Whether crafting something entirely new or reimagining the familiar, our work blends aesthetic restraint with purposeful clarity.</p>
    <p>The result is innovative design that resonates emotionally, performs beautifully, and endures as a reflection of the brand behind it. More than 200,000,000 ThinkPads have been sold since 1992, and still counting. That didn't happen by accident. </p>

    <div>
    <h4>IBM AS/400 Advanced Series</h4>
    <p><time datetime="1994">1994</time></p><p>By the early 1990's, the original IBM AS/400 product line was rapidly losing market share due to a growing perception that the product family employed outdated technology, and was highly overpriced.  David led a strategic design initiative to recast that image via a sweeping change that would forever reposition the status quo. </p>
  <p>The resulting award winning design featured stark black enclosures, dramatic air inlets, and simple yet powerful forms. This was a striking contrast to the putty colored neutral appearance that had come to dominate not only the IBM server products, but the entire industry. Following the series introduction, AS/400 Division revenues jumped by a double-digit percentage. Comments of yesterday's technology were quickly replaced by associations with objects such as the innovative F117a stealth fighter.</p>

  <div>
    <h4>IBM AS/400 Advanced Series Security Keystick</h4>
    <p><time datetime="1994">1994</time></p><p>AS/400 systems had a control panel that included special functions that were designed to only be accessed by authorized operators. Restricted access was achieved using a traditional stainless steel keylock mated to a rotating electric switch. Without the key only basic functions could be operated. Unfortunately the assembly was very costly and the metal key/lock was a  source of potential electrostatic discharge. The security keystick eliminated the dated and flawed assembly entirely. Inserting the asymmetrical key enabled access to the restricted functions, cost a fraction of the previous solution and eliminated the ESD issue altogether. </p>

  <div>
    <h4>IBM ThinkPad TrackPoint Caps</h4>
    <p><time datetime="1997">1997</time></p><p>The soft rim and soft dome caps were added  in 1997 creating a suite of Trackpoint cap options. The introduction followed an exhaustive design-led initiative to improve the existing cat tongue cap's comfort and utility. The effort revealed that three caps were better than one, giving the user choice. All three were shipped with every ThinkPad for many years. Only the soft dome cap remains in production.</p>

  <div>
    <h4>IBM Netfinity 7000</h4>
    <p><time datetime="1997">1997</time></p><p>Prior to the introduction of the Netfinity 7000, IBM's PC servers were tower based offerings that often found themselves awkwardly placed on shelves in generic computer racks. The Netfinity design eliminated this makeshift approach with a "rack and stack" solution. The system could truly rack mount using industry standard rails, or stand alone as a tower. The design also included a stacking NetBay with provision for mounting rack mounted OEM devices without purchasing a full blown rack. Many of the system components, including hardfiles, were removable from the front without tools.</p>

    <h4>IBM ThinkPad ThinkLight</h4>
    <p><time datetime="1995">1998</time></p><p>The ThinkPad ThinkLight was first introduced on the ThinkPad i Series 1400.  Observing a fellow airline passenger reading using a small light clipped to the top edge of their book, David immediately thought this idea could be adapted for use on a laptop. The final design used a white LED to illuminate the keyboard from the top bezel. It was the industry's first, and arguably most effective method, of illuminating a laptop keyboard.</p>
  </div>

    <h4>IBM NetVista X41</h4>
    <p><time datetime="2000">2000</time></p><p>
The introduction of the IBM Personal Computer in 1981 was a technology milestone that forever changed the world. Subsequent innovation, however, was primarily limited to technology advancements and improved affordability. In nearly 20 years, little had been done to dramatically change the design paradigm of metal box, chunky monitor, and keyboard. David initiated and led a design project to reinvent the standard.</p>
<p>Working in close collaboration with noted designer Richard Sapper, David and his team created an industry-leading all-in-one computer that capitalized on emerging flat-panel display technology. The final, award-winning design integrated the monitor, CPU, and optical drive into a remarkably slim profile. The optical drive was discreetly concealed within the base structure, dropping down smoothly at the touch of a button.</p>

  <div>
    <h4>IBM Aptiva S Series Loudspeakers</h4>
    <p><time datetime="2000">2000</time></p><p>Bucking the trend for bloated, frivolous designs, the Aptiva S Series speakers were conceived to match the unique angular design language of the flat panel based computer design. The sophisticated desktop speakers could be customized with brightly colored fabric grills adding to the premium image. The design was selected by Dieter Rams for a  Best of Category award at the annual IF Design Exhibition in Germany. </p>

    <h4>Lenovo ThinkPad X300</h4>
    <p><time datetime="2008">2008</time></p><p>The ThinkPad X300 stands as a landmark in industrial design, proving how disciplined engineering and purposeful aesthetics can redefine an entire product category. Its carbon-fiber and magnesium construction, meticulously refined form, and forward-looking adoption of SSD storage and LED backlighting positioned it as a breakthrough ultraportable long before such features became commonplace. Its development earned widespread attention, most notably in BusinessWeek’s cover story “The Making of the ThinkPad X300,” which showcased the intense, design-driven effort behind the machine. The project was explored even more deeply in Steve Hamm’s book The Race for Perfect, which chronicled the X300’s creation as an example of ambitious, high-stakes innovation. Together, these accounts cement the X300’s legacy as one of the most influential and thoughtfully crafted ThinkPads ever made.</p>

    <h4>Lenovo Skylight</h4>
    <p><time datetime="2010">2010</time></p><p>Skylight was an early “smartbook” product designed as a lightweight, always-connected device that blended elements of a smartphone and laptop. The imaginative overall product design was created by Richard Sapper, but the keyboard was the work of David and his team. Although the product was short-lived, the sculpted island style keyboard was eventually adopted for use on future ThinkPad and consumer laptops. The sculpted key surface and unique D-shape aid substantially in enhancing comfort and improving typing accuracy.</p>

  <div>
    <h4>Lenovo ThinkPad Wordmark with Heartbeat LED</h4>
    <p><time datetime="2010">2010</time></p><p>Shortly following the Lenovo acquisition of IBM's PC business, the IBM logo was removed from ThinkPad. David was a strong proponent of establishing ThinkPad as the primary badge on the product due to the brand's high recognition and subsequent value. He proposed using the sub-brand font, normally appearing below the IBM logo, as ThinkPad's new wordmark. He enhanced it with a bright red dot over the letter i which was derived from the TrackPoint cap. His now iconic concept was universally adopted as the new ThinkPad product badge worldwide in 2007. </p>
    <p>In 2010 the dot was enhanced with a glowing red LED that is still in use today. The dot glows solid if the ThinkPad is powered on and slowly pulses like a heartbeat when in a suspended sleep state. The design draws attention and adds life to the brand. </p>

    <h4>ThinkPad X1 Carbon</h4>
    <p><time datetime="2012">2012</time></p><p>The first-generation ThinkPad X1 Carbon introduced a bold new interpretation of classic ThinkPad design. It's carbon-fiber reinforced chassis delivered exceptional strength with a remarkably low weight.

                    Anna’s Archive is having a rough month. Following mysterious .org and .se domain suspensions, the shadow library is now facing a permanent injunction from a federal court. After dropping a multi-million damages claim, OCLC won a default judgment and permanent injunction against Anna's Archive, which it plans to enforce against hosting companies.
        </p>
      </div><div>
        <p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/annasar.jpg" alt="anna's archive" width="198" height="198" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/annasar.jpg 198w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/annasar-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 198px) 100vw, 198px"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna%27s_Archive">Anna’s Archive</a> has had its fair share of <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/annas-archive-loses-org-domain-after-surprise-suspension/">domain troubles</a> over the past two weeks.</p>
<p>First, the site lost control over its original annas-archive.org domain after the U.S.-based Public Interest Registry (PIR) placed it on <a href="https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/epp-status-codes-2014-06-16-en"><em>serverHold</em></a>. </p>
<p>PIR typically only takes these kinds of measures based on a court order. However, when we asked for more details, the registry <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/annas-archive-loses-org-domain-after-surprise-suspension/">informed us</a> that it was “unable to comment on the situation at this time,” only adding to the mystery. </p>
<p>A few days ago, the domain trouble continued when Anna’s Archive’s .SE domain suddenly became unresponsive after being operational for years. For this domain, the registrar took action, as the site was put on <em>clientHold</em>. While we tried to get additional information from the registrar, our requests remained unanswered. </p>
<p>While it is clear that ‘something’ is going on, it’s not clear what. The troubles started not long after Anna’s Archive announced that it had <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/annas-archive-backed-up-spotify-plans-to-release-300tb-music-archive/">backed up Spotify</a>, but there is no concrete link to a music industry push against the site.</p>
<h2>OCLC Seeks Permanent Injunction</h2>
<p>What we do know for certain is that Anna’s Archive’s troubles are not over yet. Yesterday, a federal court in Ohio issued a default judgment and permanent injunction against the site’s unidentified operator(s). </p>
<p>This order was requested by OCLC, which owns the proprietary WorldCat database that was <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/annas-archive-scraped-worldcat-to-help-preserve-all-books-in-the-world-231003/">scraped and published</a> by Anna’s Archive more than two years ago. OCLC initially demanded millions of dollars in damages but eventually dropped this request, focusing on taking the site down through an injunction that would also apply to intermediaries. </p>
<p>“Anna’s Archive’s flagrantly illegal actions have damaged and continue to irreparably damage OCLC. As such, issuance of a permanent injunction is necessary to stop any further harm to OCLC,” the request read. </p>
<p>This pivot makes sense since Anna’s Archive did not respond to the lawsuit and would likely ignore all payment demands too. However, with the right type of court order, third-party services such as hosting companies and domain registrars might come along.</p>
<h2>Court Grants Default Judgment</h2>
<p>The permanent injunction, issued by U.S. District Court Judge Michael Watson yesterday, does not mention any third-party services by name. However, it is directed at all parties that are “in active concert and participation with” Anna’s Archive.</p>
<p>Specifically, the site’s operator and these third parties are prohibited from scraping WorldCat data, storing or distributing the data on Anna’s Archive websites, and encouraging others to store, use or share this data. </p>
<p>Additionally, the site has to delete all WorldCat data, which also includes all torrents.</p>
<center>The order</center><br><center><picture loading="lazy" decoding="async">
<source type="image/webp" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/anna-conclude.png.webp 1312w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/anna-conclude-300x226.png.webp 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px">
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/anna-conclude.png" alt="anna conclude" width="600" height="453" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/anna-conclude.png 1312w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/anna-conclude-300x226.png 300w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/anna-conclude-600x453.png 600w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/anna-conclude-150x113.png 150w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/anna-conclude-200x150.png 200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px">
</picture>
</center>
<p>Judge Watson denied the default judgment for ‘unjust enrichment’ and ‘tortious interference.’ However, he granted the order based on the ‘trespass to chattels’ and ‘breach of contract’ claims. </p>
<p>The latter is particularly noteworthy, as the judge ruled that because Anna’s Archive is a ‘sophisticated party’ that scraped the site daily, it had constructive notice of the terms and entered into a ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browsewrap">browsewrap</a>‘ agreement simply by using the service.</p>
<p>While these nuances are important for legal experts, the result for Anna’s Archive is that it lost. And while there are no monetary damages, the permanent injunction can certainly have an impact.</p>
<h2>More Trouble Ahead?</h2>
<p>It is expected that OCLC will use the injunction to motivate third-party intermediaries to take action against Anna’s Archive. </p>
<p>Whether intermediaries are considered in “active concert” with Anna’s Archive will differ based on who you ask. However, OCLC previously said that it intends to “take the<br>
judgment to website hosting services to remove WorldCat data from Anna’s Archive’s websites”.</p>
<p>The injunction that was issued yesterday obviously cannot explain the earlier domain name troubles. That said, it’s not unthinkable that OCLC will also send the injunction to domain registrars and registries, to add further pressure. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div data-theme="ivory"><p>Last October we launched Claude for Life Sciences—a suite of connectors and skills that made Claude a better scientific collaborator. Since then, <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/healthcare-life-sciences#tab-media-0">we've invested heavily in making Claude the most capable model for scientific work</a>, with Opus 4.5 showing significant improvements in figure interpretation, computational biology, and protein understanding benchmarks. These advances, informed by our partnerships with researchers in academia and industry, reflect our commitment to understanding exactly how scientists are using AI to accelerate progress.</p><p>We’ve also been working closely with scientists through our <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/ai-for-science-program">AI for Science</a> program, which provides free API credits to leading researchers working on high-impact scientific projects around the world.</p><p>These researchers have developed custom systems that use Claude in ways that go far beyond tasks like literature reviews or coding assistance. In the labs we spoke to, Claude is a collaborator that works across all stages of the research process: making it easier and more cost-effective to understand which experiments to run, using a variety of tools to help compress projects that normally take months into hours, and finding patterns in massive datasets that humans might overlook. In many cases it’s eliminating bottlenecks, handling tasks that require deep knowledge and have previously been impossible to scale; in some it’s enabling entirely different research approaches than researchers have traditionally been able to take.</p><p>In other words, Claude is beginning to reshape how these scientists work—and point them towards novel scientific insights and discoveries.</p><h2 id="biomni-a-general-purpose-biomedical-agent-with-access-to-hundreds-of-tools-and-databases">Biomni: a general-purpose biomedical agent with access to hundreds of tools and databases</h2><p>One bottleneck in biological research is the fragmentation of tools: there are hundreds of databases, software packages, and protocols available, and researchers spend substantial time selecting from and mastering various platforms. That’s time that, in a perfect world, would be spent on running experiments, interpreting data, or pursuing new projects.</p><p><a href="https://biomni.stanford.edu/">Biomni</a>, an agentic AI platform from Stanford University, collects hundreds of tools, packages, and data-sets into a single system through which a Claude-powered agent can navigate. Researchers give it requests in plain English; Biomni automatically selects the appropriate resources. It can form hypotheses, design experimental protocols, and perform analyses across more than 25 biological subfields.</p><p>Consider the example of a genome-wide association study (GWAS), a search for genetic variants linked to some trait or disease. Perfect pitch, for instance, has a strong genetic basis. Researchers would take a very large group of people—some who are able to produce a musical note without any reference tone, and others you would never invite to karaoke—and scan their genomes for genetic variants that show up more often in one group than another.</p><p>The genome scanning is (relatively) simple. It’s the process of analyzing and making sense of the data that’s time-consuming: genomic data comes in messy formats and needs extensive cleaning; researchers must control for confounding and deal with missing data; once they identify any “hits,” they need to figure out what they actually mean—what gene is nearby (since GWAS only points to locations in a genome), what cell types it’s expressed in, what biological pathway it might affect, and so on. Each step might involve different tools, different file formats, and a lot of manual decision-making. It’s a tedious process. A single GWAS can take months. But in an early trial of Biomni, it took 20 minutes.</p><p>This might sound too good to be true—can we be sure of the accuracy of this kind of AI analysis? The Biomni team has <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.05.30.656746v1.full.pdf">validated</a> the system through several case studies in different fields. In one, Biomni designed a molecular cloning experiment; in a blind evaluation, the protocol and design matched that of a postdoc with more than five years of experience. In another, Biomni analyzed the data from over 450 wearable data files from 30 different people (a mix of continuous glucose monitoring, temperature, and physical activity) in just 35 minutes—a task estimated to take a human expert three weeks. In a third, Biomni analyzed gene activity data from over 336,000 individual cells taken from human embryonic tissue. The system confirmed regulatory relationships scientists already knew about, but also identified new transcription factors—proteins that control when genes turn on and off—that researchers hadn’t previously connected to human embryonic development.</p><p>Biomni isn’t a perfect system, which is why it includes guardrails to detect if Claude has gone off-track. Nor can it yet do everything out of the box. However, where it comes up short, experts can encode their methodology as a <a href="https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview">skill</a>—teaching the agent how an expert might approach a problem, rather than letting it improvise. For example, when working with the Undiagnosed Diseases Network on rare disease diagnosis, the team found that Claude's default approach differed substantially from what a clinician would do. So they interviewed an expert, documented their diagnostic process step by step, and taught it to Claude. With that new, previously-tacit knowledge, the agent performed well.</p><p>Biomni represents one approach: a general-purpose system that brings hundreds of tools under one roof. But other labs are building more specialized systems—targeting specific bottlenecks in their own research workflows.</p><h2 id="cheeseman-lab-automating-the-interpretation-of-large-scale-gene-knockout-experiments">Cheeseman Lab: automating the interpretation of large-scale gene knockout experiments</h2><p>When scientists want to understand what a gene does, one approach is to remove it from the cell or organism in question and see what breaks. The gene-editing tool CRISPR, which emerged around 2012, made this easy to do precisely at scale. But the utility of CRISPR was still limited: labs could generate far more data than they had the bandwidth to analyze.</p><p>This is exactly the challenge faced by Iain Cheeseman’s <a href="https://cheesemanlab.wi.mit.edu/">lab</a> at the Whitehead Institute and Department of Biology at MIT. Using CRISPR, they knock out thousands of different genes across tens of millions of human cells, then photograph each cell to see what changed. The patterns in those images reveal that genes that do similar jobs tend to produce similar-looking damage when removed. Software can detect these patterns and group genes together automatically—Cheeseman's lab built a pipeline to do exactly this called <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.05.26.656231v1">Brieflow</a> (yes, brie the cheese).</p><p>But interpreting what these gene groupings mean—why the genes cluster together, what they might have in common, whether it’s a known biological relationship or something new—still requires a human expert to comb through the scientific literature, gene by gene. It’s slow. A single screen can produce hundreds of clusters, and most never get investigated simply because labs don’t have the time, bandwidth, or in-depth knowledge about the diverse things that cells do.</p><p>For years, Cheeseman did all the interpretation himself. He estimates he can recall the function of about 5,000 genes off the top of his head, but it still takes hundreds of hours to analyze this data effectively. To accelerate this process, PhD student Matteo Di Bernardo sought to build a system that would automate Cheeseman’s approach. Working closely with Cheeseman to understand exactly how he approaches interpretation—what data sources he consults, what patterns he looks for, what makes a finding interesting—they built a Claude-powered system called <a href="https://github.com/cheeseman-lab/mozzarellm">MozzareLLM</a> (you might be seeing a theme developing here).</p><p>It takes a cluster of genes and does what an expert like Cheeseman would do: identifies what biological process they might share, flags which genes are well-understood versus poorly studied, and highlights which ones might be worth following up on. Not only does this substantially accelerate their work, but it is also helping them make important additional biological discoveries. Cheeseman finds Claude consistently catches things he missed. “Every time I go through I’m like, I didn’t notice that one! And in each case, these are discoveries that we can understand and verify,” he says.</p><p>What helps make MozzareLLM so useful is that it isn’t a one-trick pony: it can incorporate diverse information and reason like a scientist. Most notably, it provides confidence levels in its findings, which Cheeseman emphasizes is crucial. It helps him decide whether or not to invest more resources in following up on its conclusions.</p><p>In building MozzareLLM, Di Bernardo tested multiple AI models. Claude outperformed the alternatives—in one case correctly identifying an RNA modification pathway that other models dismissed as random noise.</p><p>Cheeseman and Di Bernardo envision making these Claude-annotated datasets public—letting experts in other fields follow up on clusters his lab doesn't have time to pursue. A mitochondrial biologist, for instance, could dive into mitochondrial clusters that Cheeseman's team has flagged but never investigated. As other labs adopt MozzareLLM for their own CRISPR experiments, it could accelerate the interpretation and validation of genes whose functions have remained uncharacterized for years.</p><h2 id="lundberg-lab-testing-ai-led-hypothesis-generation-for-which-genes-to-study">Lundberg Lab: testing AI-led hypothesis generation for which genes to study</h2><p>The Cheeseman lab uses optical pooled screening—a technique that lets them knock out thousands of genes in a single experiment. Their bottleneck is interpretation. But not every cell type works with pooled approaches. Some labs, such as the <a href="https://lundberglab.stanford.edu/">Lundberg Lab at Stanford</a>, run smaller, focused screens, and their bottleneck comes earlier: deciding which genes to target in the first place.</p><p>Because a single focused screen can cost upwards of $20,000 and costs increase with size, labs typically target a few hundred genes they think are <em>most likely</em> to be involved in a given condition. The conventional process involves a team of grad students and postdocs sitting around a Google spreadsheet, adding candidate genes one by one with a sentence of justification, or maybe a link to a paper. It's an educated guessing game, informed by literature reviews, expertise, and intuition, but constrained by human bandwidth. It’s also fallible, based as it is on what other scientists already figured out and written down, and what the humans in the room happen to recall.</p><p>The Lundberg Lab is using Claude to flip that approach. Instead of asking “what guesses can we make based on what researchers have already studied?”, their system asks “what <em>should</em> be studied, based on molecular properties?”</p><p>The team built a map of every known molecule in the cell—proteins, RNA, DNA—and how they relate to each other. They mapped out which proteins bind together, which genes code for which products, and which molecules are structurally similar. They can then give Claude a target—for instance which genes might govern a particular cellular structure or process—and Claude navigates that map to identify candidate genes based on their biological properties and relationships.</p><p>The Lundberg lab is currently running an experiment to study how well this approach works. To do so, they needed to identify a topic where very little research had been done (if they’d looked at something well-studied, Claude might already know about the established findings). They chose primary cilia: antenna-like appendages on cells that we still know little about but which are implicated in a variety of developmental and neurological disorders. Next, they’ll run a whole genome screen to see which genes actually affect cilia formation, and establish the ground-truth.</p><p>The test is to compare human experts to Claude. The humans will use the spreadsheet approach to make their guesses. Claude will generate its own using the molecular relationship map. If Claude catches (hypothetically) 150 out of 200, and the humans catch 80 out of 200, that's proof the approach works better. Even if they're about equal in discovering the genes, it’s still likely Claude works much faster, and could make the whole research process more efficient.</p><p>If the approach works, the team envisions it becoming a standard first step in focused perturbation screening. Instead of gambling on intuition or using brute-force approaches that have become prevalent in contemporary research, labs could make informed bets about which genes to target—getting better results without needing the infrastructure for whole-genome screening.</p><h3 id="looking-forward">Looking forward</h3><p>None of these systems are perfect. But they point to the ways that in just a few short years scientists have begun to incorporate AI as a research partner capable of far more than basic tasks—indeed, increasingly able to speed up, and in some cases even replace, many different aspects of the research process.</p><p>In speaking with these labs, a common theme emerged: the usefulness of the tools they’ve built continues to grow in concert with AI capabilities. Each model release brings noticeable improvements. Where just two years ago earlier models were limited to writing code or summarizing papers, more powerful agents have begun, if slowly, to replicate the very work those papers describe.</p><p>As tools advance and AI models continue to grow more intelligent, we’re continuing to watch and learn from how scientific discovery develops along with them.</p><p><em>For more detail on the expanded Claude for Life Sciences capabilities, <a href="https://claude.com/solutions/life-sciences">see here</a>, and our <a href="https://claude.com/resources/tutorials-category/life-sciences">tutorials here</a>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <td><p><span size="6" color="#CCCC00">O</span>f course, Reading Day had been different. Partly, there was the 
        simple fact of childhood. A boy of eight takes many extraordinary things 
        in stride. One day you can’t read and the next day you can. That’s 
        just the way things are. Like the sun shining.</p>
      <p>And then not so much depended upon it. There were no recruiters just 
        ahead, waiting and jostling for the lists and scores on the coming Olympics. 
        A boy or girl who goes through the Reading Day is just someone who has 
        ten more years of undifferentiated living upon Earth’s crawling 
        surface; just someone who returns to his family with one new ability.</p>
      <p>By the time Education Day came, ten years later, George wasn’t 
        even sure of most of the details of his own Reading Day.</p>
      <p>Most clearly of all, he remembered it to be a dismal September day with 
        a mild rain falling. (September for Reading Day; November for. Education 
        Day; May for Olympics. They made nursery rhymes out of it.) George had 
        dressed by the wall lights, with his parents far more excited than he 
        himself was. His father was a Registered Pipe Fitter and had found his 
        occupation on Earth. This fact had always been a humiliation to him, although, 
        of course, as anyone could see plainly, most of each generation must stay 
        on Earth in the nature of things.</p>
      <p>There had to be farmers and miners and even technicians on Earth. It 
        was only the late-model, high-specialty professions that were in demand 
        on the Outworlds, and only a few millions a year out of Earth’s 
        eight billion population could be exported. Every man and woman on Earth 
        couldn’t be among that group.</p>
      <p>But every man and woman could hope that at least one of his children 
        could be one, and Platen, Senior, was certainly no exception. It was obvious 
        to him (and, to be sure, to others as well) that George was notably intelligent 
        and quick-minded. He would be bound to do well and he would have to, as 
        he was an only child. If George didn’t end on an Outworld, they 
        would have to wait for grandchildren before a next chance would come along, 
        and that was too far in the future to be much consolation.</p>
      <p>Reading Day would not prove much, of course, but it would be the only 
        indication they would have before the big day itself. Every parent on 
        Earth would be listening to the quality of reading when his child came 
        home with it; listening for any particularly easy flow of words and building 
        that into certain omens of the future. There were few families that didn’t 
        have at least one hopeful who, from Reading Day on, was the great hope 
        because of the way he handled his trisyllabics.</p>
      <p>Dimly, George was aware of the cause of his parents’ tension, and 
        if there was any anxiety in his young heart that drizzly morning, it was 
        only the fear that his father’s hopeful expression might fade out 
        when he returned home with his reading.</p>
      <p>The children met in the large assembly room of the town’s Education 
        Hall. All over Earth, in millions of local halls, throughout that month, 
        similar groups of children would he meeting. George felt depressed by 
        the grayness of the room and by the other children, strained and stiff 
        in unaccustomed finery.</p>
      <p>Automatically, George did as all the rest of the children did. He found 
        the small clique that represented the children on his floor of the apartment 
        house and joined them.</p>
      <p>Trevelyan, who lived immediately next door, still wore his hair childishly 
        long and was years removed from the sideburns and thin, reddish mustache 
        that he was to grow as soon as he was physiologically capable of it.</p>
      <p>Trevelyan (to whom George was then known as Jawjee) said, “Bet 
        you’re scared.”</p>
      <p>“I am not,’ said George. Then, confidentially, “My 
        folks got a hunk of printing up on the dresser in my room, and when I 
        come home, I’m going to read it for them.” (George’s 
        main suffering at the moment lay in the fact that he didn’t quite 
        know where to put his hands. He had been warned not to scratch his head 
        or rub his ears or pick his nose or put his hands into his pockets. This 
        eliminated almost every possibility.)</p>
      <p>Trevelyan put <em>his </em>hands in his pockets and said, “My father 
        isn’t worried.”</p>
      <p>Trevelyan, Senior, had been a Metallurgist on Diporia for nearly seven 
        years, which gave him a superior social status in his neighborhood even 
        though he had retired and returned to Earth.</p>
      <p>Earth discouraged these re-immigrants because of population problems, 
        but a small trickle did return. For one thing the cost of living was lower 
        on Earth, and what was a trifling annuity on Diporia, say, was a comfortable 
        income on Earth. Besides, there were always men who found more satisfaction 
        in displaying their success before the friends and scenes of their childhood 
        than before all the rest of the Universe besides.</p>
      <p>Trevelyan, Senior further explained that if he stayed on Diporia, so 
        would his children, and Diporia was a one-spaceship world. Back on Earth, 
        his kids could end up anywhere, even Novia.</p>
      <p>Stubby Trevelyan had picked up that item early. Even before Reading Day, 
        his conversation was based on the carelessly assumed fact that his ultimate 
        home would be in Novia.</p>
      <p>George, oppressed by thoughts of the other’s future greatness and 
        his own small-time contrast, was driven to belligerent defense at once.</p>
      <p>“My father isn’t worried either. He just wants to hear me 
        read because he knows I’ll be good. I suppose your father would 
        just as soon not hear you because he knows you’ll be all wrong.”</p>
      <p>“I will not be all wrong. Reading is <em>nothing. </em>On Novia, 
        I’ll <em>hire </em>people to read to me.”</p>
      <p>“Because you won’t be able to read yourself, on account of 
        you’re <em>dumb!”</em></p>
      <p>“Then how come I’ll be on Novia?”</p>
      <p>And George, driven, made the great denial, “Who says you’ll 
        be on Novia? Bet you don’t go anywhere.”</p>
      <p>Stubby Trevelyan reddened. “I won’t be a Pipe Fitter like 
        your old man.”</p>
      <p>“Take that back, you dumbhead.”</p>
      <p>“You take <em>that</em> back.”</p>
      <p>They stood nose to nose, not wanting to fight but relieved at having 
        something familiar to do in this strange place. Furthermore, now that 
        George had curled his hands into fists and lifted them before his face, 
        the problem of what to do with his hands was, at least temporarily, solved. 
        Other children gathered round excitedly.</p>
      <p>But then it all ended when a woman’s voice sounded loudly over 
        the public address system. There was instant silence everywhere. George 
        dropped his fists and forgot Trevelyan.</p>
      <p>“Children,” said the voice, “we are going to call out 
        your names. As each child is called, he or she is to go to one of the 
        men waiting along the side walls. Do you see them? They are wearing red 
        uniforms so they will be easy to find. The girls will go to the right. 
        The boys will go to the left. Now look about and see which man in red 
        is nearest to you —”</p>
      <p>George found his man at a glance and waited for his name to be called 
        off. He had not been introduced before this to the sophistications of 
        the alphabet and the length of time it took to reach his own name grew 
        disturbing.</p>
      <p>The crowd of children thinned; little rivulets made their way to each 
        of the red-clad guides.</p>
      <p>When the name ‘George Platen’ was finally called, his sense 
        of relief was exceeded only by the feeling of pure gladness at the fact 
        that Stubby Trevelyan still stood in his place, uncalled.</p>
      <p>George shouted back over his shoulder as he left, “Yay, Stubby, 
        maybe they don’t want you.”</p>
      <p>That moment of gaiety quickly left. He was herded into a line and directed 
        down corridors in the company of strange children. They all looked at 
        one another, large-eyed and concerned, but beyond a snuffling, “Quitcher 
        pushing” and “Hey, watch out” there was no conversation.</p>
      <p>They were handed little slips of paper which they were told must remain 
        with them. George stared at his curiously. Little black marks of different 
        shapes. He knew it to be printing but how could anyone make words out 
        of it? He couldn’t imagine.</p>
      <p>He was told to strip; he and four other boys who were all that now remained 
        together. All the new clothes came shucking off and four eight-year-olds 
        stood naked and small, shivering more out of embarrassment than cold. 
        Medical technicians came past, probing them, testing them with odd instruments, 
        pricking them for blood. Each took the little cards and made additional 
        marks on them with little black rods that produced the marks, all neatly 
        lined up, with great speed. George stared at the new marks, but they were 
        no more comprehensible than the old. The children were ordered back into 
        their clothes.</p>
      <p>They sat on separate little chairs then and waited again. Names were 
        called again and ‘George Platen’ came third.</p>
      <p>He moved into a large room, filled with frightening instruments with 
        knobs and glassy panels in front. There was a desk in the very center, 
        and behind it a man sat, his eyes on the papers piled before him.</p>
      <p>He said, “George Platen?”</p>
      <p>“Yes, sir,<sup>” </sup>said George, in a shaky whisper. All 
        this waiting and all this going here and there was making him nervous. 
        He wished it were over.</p>
      <p>The man behind the desk said, “I am Dr Lloyd, George. How are you?”</p>
      <p>The doctor didn’t look up as he spoke. It was as though he had 
        said those words over and over again and didn’t have to look up 
        any more.</p>
      <p>“I’m all right.”</p>
      <p>“Are you afraid, George?”</p>
      <p>“N — no, sir,” said George, sounding afraid even in 
        his own ears.</p>
      <p>“That’s good,” said the doctor, “because there’s 
        nothing to be afraid of you know. Let’s see, George. It says here 
        on your card that your father is named Peter and that he’s a Registered 
        Pipe Fitter and your mother is named Amy and is a Registered Home Technician. 
        Is that right?”</p>
      <p>“Y — yes, sir.”</p>
      <p>“And your birthday is 13 February,and you had an ear infection 
        about a year ago. Right?”</p>
      <p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
      <p>“Do you know how I know all these things?”</p>
      <p>“It’s on the card, I think, sir.”</p>
      <p>“That’s right.” The doctor looked up at George for 
        the first time and smiled. He showed even teeth and looked much younger 
        than George’s father. Some of George’s nervousness vanished.</p>
      <p>The doctor passed the card to George. “Do you know what all those 
        things there mean, George?”</p>
      <p>Although George knew he did not he was startled by the sudden request 
        into looking at the card as though he might understand now through some 
        sudden stroke of fate. But they were just marks as before and he passed 
        the card back. “No, sir.”</p>
      <p>“Why not?”</p>
      <p>George felt a sudden pang of suspicion concerning the sanity of this 
        doctor. Didn’t he know why not?</p>
      <p>George said, “I can’t read, sir.”</p>
      <p>“Would you like to read?”</p>
      <p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
      <p>“Why, George?”</p>
      <p>George stared, appalled. No one had ever asked him that. He had no answer. 
        He said falteringly, “I don’t know, sir.”</p>
      <p>“Printed information will direct you all through your life. There 
        is so much you’ll have to know even after Education Day. Cards like 
        this one will tell you. Books will tell you. Television screens will tell 
        you. Printing will tell you such useful things and such interesting things 
        that not being able to read would be as bad as not being able to see. 
        Do you understand?”</p>
      <p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
      <p>“Are you afraid, George?”</p>
      <p>“No, sir.”</p>
      <p>“Good. Now I’ll tell you exactly what we’ll do first. 
        I’m going to put these wires on your forehead just over the corners 
        of your eyes. They’ll stick there but they won’t hurt at all. 
        Then, I’ll turn on something that will make a buzz. It will sound 
        funny and it may tickle you, but it won’t hurt. Now if it does hurt, 
        you tell me, and I’ll turn it off right away, but it won’t 
        hurt. All right?”</p>
      <p>George nodded and swallowed.</p>
      <p>“Are you ready?”</p>
      <p>George nodded. He closed his eyes while the doctor busied himself. His 
        parents had explained this to him. They, too, had said it wouldn’t 
        hurt, but then there were always the older children. There were the ten- 
        and twelve-year-olds who howled after the eight-year-olds waiting for 
        Reading Day, “Watch out for the needle.” There were the others 
        who took you off in confidence and said, “They got to cut your head 
        open. They use a sharp knife that big with a hook on it,” and so 
        on into horrifying details.</p>
      <p>George had never believed them but he had had nightmares, and now he 
        closed his eyes and felt pure terror.</p>
      <p>He didn’t feel the wires at his temple. The buzz was a distant 
        thing, and there was the sound of his own blood in his ears, ringing hollowly 
        as though it and he were in a large cave. Slowly he chanced opening his 
        eyes.</p>
      <p>The doctor had his back to him. From one of the instruments a strip of 
        paper unwound and was covered with a thin, wavy purple line. The doctor 
        tore off pieces and put them into a slot in another machine. He did it 
        over and over again. Each time a little piece of film came out which the 
        doctor looked at. Finally, he turned toward George with a queer frown 
        between his eyes.</p>
      <p>The buzzing stopped.</p>
      <p>George said breathlessly, “Is it over?”</p>
      <p>The doctor said, “Yes,” but he was still frowning.</p>
      <p>“Can I read now?’ asked George. He felt no different.</p>
      <p>The doctor said, “What?” then smiled very suddenly and briefly. 
        He said, “It works fine, George. You’ll be reading in fifteen 
        minutes. Now we’re going to use another machine this time and it 
        will take longer. I’m going to cover your whole head, and when I 
        turn it on you won’t be able to see or hear anything for a while, 
        but it won’t hurt. Just to make sure I’m going to give you 
        a little switch to hold in your hand. If anything hurts, you press the 
        little button and everything shuts off. All right?”</p>
      <p>In later years, George was told that the little switch was strictly a 
        dummy; that it was introduced solely for confidence. He never did know 
        for sure, however, since he never pushed the button.</p>
      <p>A large smoothly curved helmet with a rubbery inner lining was placed 
        over his head and left there. Three or four little knobs seemed to grab 
        at him and bite into his skull, but there was only a little pressure that 
        faded. No pain.</p>
      <p>The doctor’s voice sounded dimly. “Everything all right, 
        George?”</p>
      <p>And then, with no real warning, a layer of thick felt closed down all 
        about him. He was disembodied, there was no sensation, no universe, only 
        himself and a distant murmur at the very ends of nothingness telling him 
        something — telling him — telling him —</p>
      <p>He strained to hear and understand but there was all that thick felt 
        between.</p>
      <p>Then the helmet was taken off his head, and the light was so bright that 
        it hurt his eyes while the doctor’s voice drummed at his ears.</p>
      <p>The doctor said, “Here’s your card, George. What does it 
        say?”</p>
      <p>George looked at his card again and gave out a strangled shout. The marks 
        weren’t just marks at all. They made up words. They were words just 
        as clearly as though something were whispering them in his ears. He could 
        hear them being whispered as he looked at them.</p>
      <p>“What does it say, George?”</p>
      <p>“It says — it says — ‘Platen, George. Born 13 
        February 6492 of Peter and Amy Platen in...’” He broke off.</p>
      <p>“You can read, George,” said the doctor. “It’s 
        all over.”</p>
      <p>“For good? I won’t forget how?”</p>
      <p>“Of course not” The doctor leaned over to shake hands gravely. 
        “You will be taken home now.”</p>
      <p>It was days before George got over this new and great talent of his. 
        He read for his father with such facility that Platen, Senior, wept and 
        called relatives to tell the good news.</p>
      <p>George walked about town, reading every scrap of printing he could find 
        and wondering how it was that none of it had ever made sense to him before.</p>
      <p>He tried to remember how it was not to be able to read and 
        he couldn’t. As far as his feeling about it was concerned, he had 
        always been able to read. Always.</p></td>

Otherwise, I would walk around asking the sellers if they had any knives. In the early days from 2005 to 2008, it was common for people to say, “No, but I do have some cook knives”. Most people asking around for knives at 6 am back then were looking for old military, pocket, and hunting knives. Culinary knives were considered chaff, often sold for $1 to $5 because they were deemed to have little value beyond utilitarian use. Within about 5 to 8 years, it seems one of these dealers heard from someone that a Sabatier sold for $100 online, and after that, every Sabatier became worth $100, and in the eyes of many, every chef' knife became a Sabatier. Deceased people whose families had no interest in their stuff and people who didn’t pony up on their storage unit bills started having fewer and fewer good knives in their stuff, and eventually, the volume of good culinary knives made their way less and less to the market. This is the short version of my small microcosm as seen from a Bay Area perspective; maybe it's different elsewhere, but this is my experience.</p><p>There would be a feeding frenzy as good stuff was available to be found from about 5 am to 7:30 am.  The fresh goods were put out first thing in the morning. By then, the best stuff had been snatched up by the professional pickers before the general public arrived around 8 or 9. At this time, sometimes a second tier of boxes would come out, and something good would turn up. By this time, I had been walking for 3 or 4 hours and would be getting hungry, and the tiredness would be setting in, my eyes would feel dry, and my face would hurt from sleep deprivation. This feeling was a familiar feeling at this time in my life, with kids born in ‘04 and ‘08, little sleep, and the necessity to work long hours when I could. Sunday was especially long hours, even if a baby had been up the night before; getting in a good haul was crucial in those days. A couple of bags heavy with knives by 7 or 8 meant I could go home early and start cleaning that week’s finds.

These shame-filled events and their associated knives were etched in my memory. I would walk on by if I saw them, keep scanning for the telltale handle of a chef knife, a box that could contain pocket knives, or a box of kitchen utensils that could have a stowaway knife in it. I could scan the primmest, most tastefully turned out booth in 10 seconds and the biggest heap of meth rubble that vomited itself out the back of a dirty white van in 20 seconds. I got good at finding things quickly and keeping a straight face, asking how much something was when I found something great. There were a few other guys who were also looking for knives; sometimes they had another specialty too, maybe old fishing gear or old pens or lighters. There were generalist buyers and specialists like me, the Johnny one notes. There were the watch guys (they were all guys), the camera people, the jewelry people who formed little conspiratorial-looking huddles with little bottles of acid and scales. The book people were usually very easy-going, and the people looking for art were often the most hostile, snotty, bump you and not say ‘excuse me’ types. The worst offender looked like a nelly Ichabod Crane and wore the least convincing toupee since Xavier Cugat. For the most part, some of the most polite were the knife guys; they would never start digging around in a box you were already sorting. Getting stabbed wasn’t a threat per se, but multiple hands in a box of knives is a bad idea. We would wait and even tell others if we passed up something somebody else might be into.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!RTyN!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb0d3ba3c-969b-455e-86b0-212d2a49120b_1920x926.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!RTyN!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb0d3ba3c-969b-455e-86b0-212d2a49120b_1920x926.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!RTyN!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb0d3ba3c-969b-455e-86b0-212d2a49120b_1920x926.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!RTyN!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb0d3ba3c-969b-455e-86b0-212d2a49120b_1920x926.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!RTyN!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb0d3ba3c-969b-455e-86b0-212d2a49120b_1920x926.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!RTyN!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb0d3ba3c-969b-455e-86b0-212d2a49120b_1920x926.jpeg" width="1456" height="702" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b0d3ba3c-969b-455e-86b0-212d2a49120b_1920x926.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:702,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:169705,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://kellykozakandjoshdonald.substack.com/i/184126957?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb0d3ba3c-969b-455e-86b0-212d2a49120b_1920x926.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!RTyN!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb0d3ba3c-969b-455e-86b0-212d2a49120b_1920x926.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!RTyN!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb0d3ba3c-969b-455e-86b0-212d2a49120b_1920x926.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!RTyN!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb0d3ba3c-969b-455e-86b0-212d2a49120b_1920x926.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!RTyN!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb0d3ba3c-969b-455e-86b0-212d2a49120b_1920x926.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Typically, a trip to the market would lead up to a time late in the morning when I would start to get the feeling that it was time to go.  Often, I was still looking around, maybe I hadn’t made a good buy in 30 minutes to an hour, or someone I hoped to see wasn’t there. Maybe another market was happening somewhere else that drew a lot of regular vendors away. Anyhow, at this ‘certain time’ I would be feeling a little desperate to make a score and would start looking at stuff I typically wouldn’t. Certain vendors who generally priced things too high or had the same shit on display for months and years, one side getting bleached from the sun, baking away Sunday after Sunday in a wood box under a heavily worn sheet of plexiglass, looking like the smell of a diaper pail. I would ask myself what the hell I was doing looking at that sunbleached shit and would make the walk up the hill home to drink coffee and take my kids to the playground. Other times, I would pick things up that I knew had little value just to pick something up. I did have one hard and fast metric for when it was time to go home, like a disciplined barfly who held themselves to certain standards, and that was when I intentionally picked up a Forgecraft or Old Hickory knife.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tjQb!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1746d950-7204-45d9-9adc-fed2469c2937_790x539.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tjQb!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1746d950-7204-45d9-9adc-fed2469c2937_790x539.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tjQb!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1746d950-7204-45d9-9adc-fed2469c2937_790x539.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tjQb!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1746d950-7204-45d9-9adc-fed2469c2937_790x539.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tjQb!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1746d950-7204-45d9-9adc-fed2469c2937_790x539.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tjQb!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1746d950-7204-45d9-9adc-fed2469c2937_790x539.png" width="790" height="539" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1746d950-7204-45d9-9adc-fed2469c2937_790x539.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:539,&quot;width&quot;:790,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:687107,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://kellykozakandjoshdonald.substack.com/i/184126957?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1746d950-7204-45d9-9adc-fed2469c2937_790x539.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tjQb!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1746d950-7204-45d9-9adc-fed2469c2937_790x539.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tjQb!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1746d950-7204-45d9-9adc-fed2469c2937_790x539.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tjQb!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1746d950-7204-45d9-9adc-fed2469c2937_790x539.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tjQb!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1746d950-7204-45d9-9adc-fed2469c2937_790x539.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>These knives are not really bad for inexpensive American-made carbon steel knives from the 1950s and ‘60s. They are instantly recognizable, with boxy hickory handles and a kind of rectangular waffle pattern with a black forge scale and a big, wide primary grind on the carbon steel blades. There were so many of them, and typically the condition was so-so (like airplane food that was awful and in such small portions). They never fetched much, but they were fine from a utilitarian standard, provided they weren’t too thick from being sharpened down 500 times. From my perspective, even if purchased cheaply, they just treaded water money-wise and were not worth the time. I had a contract with myself; if I picked one up, it was time to go home. It was usually about 9:30 by that time, and everything good was gone. More than just the association with the disappointment of getting a final bid of $12.48 on an ebay auction after having spent $10, I rejected them for the self-loathing of needy 9:30 am flea market choices. Self-consciously having an emotional need to be lucky and feeling like a ragpicker. Fuck that.</p><p>Around 2018, I began noticing people bringing re-handled Forgecraft chef knives to the shop for sharpening. I was a little dumbstruck; it struck me as more than a little weird. I think I also felt that all my efforts to introduce people to the great old culinary knives were in vain, as this trailer trash was being crowned. I vaguely remember acting the cranky old man, accusing people of ‘putting lipstick on a pig’ when finding them rehandling expensive materials in sharpening orders. Maybe I wasn’t being fair, I suspected but I also didn’t understand why go to so much trouble to re-handle and polish a Forgecraft.</p><p>That said, the overall footprint geometry of a brand new Forgecraft chef knife is not terrible aside from the thickness of the tip half. In designing chef knives, I default to essentially a more symmetrical-sided triangle of a footprint like the Forgecraft has. it’s actually a bit more wa-gyuto-like than a typical Western knife, and if one is determined / sophisticated enough, the wide primary bevels do allow for thinning. It’s still a little to thick to cut nicely, I think, but with a good thinning, the geometry isn’t bad. The .95% carbon steel is not hard to sharpen and can take a fairly fine edge. I don’t seem to remember them keeping an edge super well, times that I have experimented with them but I do remember being very happy with one for a short period of time that I got from Jivano on 18th street (where 18 Reasons is now) in 1993 or 94. I did have several that I used in my home kitchens before starting Bernal Cutlery, and after starting, I did use a Forgecraft chef knife early on, in about 2005 or 6, for a few weeks. Beyond being a worse sharpener than I realized back then, they are too thick and don’t seem to hold an edge really well.</p><p>So I started touching Forgecraft knives again, and maybe giving them a less judgmental view. I had to ask myself in my orthodoxy, was I being like the old timers at the flea market who told me they didn’t have any knives but had some kitchen knives? Did resale value influence my assessment of the intrinsic value of these knives? To be fair, I could start to see why people were excited by them, but also had a little bit of suspicion as the nearly identical ‘Old Hickory’ knives made by the Ontario knife company got no love, and I suspected there was a kind of internet trend going on with Forgecraft. Both seem to be a soft heat treatment of a fairly high carbon content non-stainless steel; 1095 (.95% carbon), with the forge scale waffle pattern face and big wide primary bevels and hickory handles.</p><p>In re-examining my attitudes about the Forgecraft chef knife (I still think they are a little ungraceful in their lack of taper and heavy tip), I have thought about changing tastes and young people getting into old stuff. The Forgecraft craze is over, I think, but I am happy to see younger people take a new interest in old culinary knives. While there will be other fads that come and go with it I think this interest has an immense durability as culinary knives are not going away, and they represent an item from history that we can directly relate to using. That said I will shit when people start collecting Ikea knives, I hope I live long enough to see it so then I can scoff.</p></div></article></div><div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div><div><h3>Ready for more?</h3></div></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://willhbr.net/2025/10/20/light-mode-infffffflation/">https://willhbr.net/2025/10/20/light-mode-infffffflation/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46662662">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Back in the day, light mode wasn’t called “light mode”. It was just the way that computers were, we didn’t really think about turning everything light or dark. Sure, some applications were often dark (photo editors, IDEs, terminals) but everything else was light, and that was fine.</p>

<p>What we didn’t notice is that light mode has been slowly getting lighter, and I’ve got a graph to prove it. I did what any normal person would do, I downloaded the same (or similar) screenshots from the <a href="https://512pixels.net/projects/aqua-screenshot-library/">MacOS Screenshot Library</a> on <a href="https://512pixels.net/"><em>512 Pixels</em></a>. This project would have been much more difficult without a single place to get well-organised screenshots from. I cropped each image so just a representative section of the window was present, here shown with a pinkish rectangle:</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://willhbr.net/images/2025/macos-light-mode.webp" alt="screenshot of OS X Snow Leopard Finder window with toolbar section highlighted"></p>

<p>Then used <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pillow/">Pillow</a> to get the average lightness of each cropped image:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>for</span> <span>file</span> <span>in</span> <span>sorted</span><span>(</span><span>os</span><span>.</span><span>listdir</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>.</span><span>'</span><span>)):</span>

  <span>greyscale</span> <span>=</span> <span>image</span><span>.</span><span>convert</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>L</span><span>'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>stat</span> <span>=</span> <span>ImageStat</span><span>.</span><span>Stat</span><span>(</span><span>greyscale</span><span>)</span>
  <span>avg_lightness</span> <span>=</span> <span>int</span><span>(</span><span>stat</span><span>.</span><span>mean</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>])</span>
  <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"</span><span>{</span><span>file</span><span>}</span><span>\t</span><span>{</span><span>avg_lightness</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This ignores any kind of perceived brightness or the tinting that MacOS has been doing for a while based on your wallpaper colour. I could go down a massive tangent trying to work out exactly what the best way to measure this is, but given that the screenshots aren’t perfectly comparable between versions, comparing the average brightness of a greyscale image seems reasonable.</p>

<p>I graphed that on the release year of each OS version, doing the same for dark mode:</p>

<p>You can clearly see that the brightness of the UI has been steadily increasing for the last 16 years. The upper line is the default mode/light mode, the lower line is dark mode. When I started using MacOS in 2012, I was running Snow Leopard, the windows had an average brightness of 71%. Since then they’ve steadily increased so that in MacOS Tahoe, they’re at a full 100%.</p>

<p>What I’ve graphed here is just the brightness of the window chrome, which isn’t really representative of the actual total screen brightness. A better study would be looking at the overall brightness of a typical set of apps. The default background colour for windows, as well as the colours for inactive windows, would probably give a more complete picture.</p>

<p>For example, <a href="https://512pixels.net/projects/aqua-screenshot-library/macos-26-tahoe/">in Tahoe</a> the darkest colour in a typical light-mode window is the colour of a section in an inactive settings window, at 97% brightness. In Snow Leopard the equivalent colour was 90%, and that was one of the <em>brightest</em> parts of the window, since the window chrome was typically darker than the window content.</p>

<p>I tried to remember exactly when I started using dark mode all the time on MacOS. I’ve always used a dark background for my editor and terminal, but I wasn’t sure when I swapped the system theme across. When it first came out I seem to remember thinking that it looked gross.</p>

<p>It obviously couldn’t be earlier than 2018, as that’s when dark mode was introduced in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS_Mojave">MacOS Mojave</a>. I’m pretty sure that when I updated my personal laptop to an M1 MacBook Air at the end of 2020 that I set it to use dark mode. This would make sense, because the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS_Big_Sur">Big Sur</a> update bumped the brightness from 85% to 97%, which probably pushed me over the edge.</p>

<p>I think the reason this happens is that if you look at two designs, photos, or whatever, it’s really easy to be drawn in to liking the brighter one more. Or if they’re predominantly dark, then the darker one. I’ve done it myself with this very site. If I’m tweaking the colours it’s easy to bump up the brightness on the background and go “ooh wow yeah that’s definitely cleaner”, then swap it back and go “ewww it looks like it needs a good scrub”. If it’s the dark mode colours, then a darker background will just look <em>cooler</em>.</p>

<p>I’m not a designer, but I assume that resisting this urge is something you learn in design school. Just like making a website look good with a non-greyscale background.</p>

<p>This year in iOS 26, some UI elements use the HDR screen to make some elements and highlights brighter than 100% white.<sup id="fnref:not-me"><a href="#fn:not-me" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> This year it’s reasonably subtle, but the inflation potential is there. If you’ve ever looked at an HDR photo on an iPhone (or any other HDR screen) then looked at the UI that’s still being shown in SDR, you’ll know just how grey and sad it looks. If you’re designing a new UI, how tempting will it be to make just a little bit more of it just a little bit brighter?</p>

<p>As someone whose job involves looking at MacOS for a lot of the day, I find that I basically <em>have</em> to use dark mode to avoid looking at a display where all the system UI is 100% white blasting in my eyes. But the alternative doesn’t have to be near-black for that, I would happily have a UI that’s a medium grey. In fact what I’ve missed since swapping to using dark mode is that I don’t have contrast between windows. Everything looks the same, whether it’s a text editor, IDE, terminal, web browser, or Finder window. All black, all the time.</p>

<p>Somewhat in the spirit of <a href="https://mavericksforever.com/">Mavericks Forever</a>, if I were to pick an old MacOS design to go back to it would probably be <a href="https://512pixels.net/projects/aqua-screenshot-library/os-x-10-10-yosemite/">Yosemite</a>. I don’t have any nostalgia for skeuomorphic brushed metal or stitched leather, but I do quite like the flattened design and blur effects that Yosemite brought. Ironically Yosemite was a substantial jump in brightness from previous versions.</p>

<p>So if you’re making an interface or website, be bold and choose a 50% grey. My eyes will thank you.</p>

<p dir="auto">Kip (meaning "grammatical mood" in Turkish) is an experimental programming language that uses Turkish grammatical cases as part of its type system. It demonstrates how natural language morphology—specifically Turkish noun cases and vowel harmony—can be integrated into programming language design.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is a research/educational project exploring the intersection of linguistics and type theory, not a production programming language.</p>
<p dir="auto">There is also <a href="https://github.com/joom/kip/wiki/K%C4%B1lavuz">a tutorial in Turkish</a> and <a href="https://github.com/joom/kip/wiki/Tutorial">a tutorial in English</a> that explains how to write Kip programs.</p>
<div dir="auto"><p dir="auto">Note</p><p dir="auto">Kip is experimental. Expect changes in syntax and behavior over time.</p>
</div>
<p dir="auto">For you to get a taste of what Kip looks like, here is an example program that prompts the user to enter a number and then prints that many of the Fibonacci numbers:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="(* İlk n Fibonacci sayısını yazdırır. *)
(bu tam-sayıyı) (şu tam-sayıyı) (o tam-sayıyı) işlemek,
  (onla 0'ın eşitliği) doğruysa,

  yanlışsa,
    bunu yazıp,
    şunu (bunla şunun toplamını) (onla 1'in farkını) işlemektir.

  &quot;Bir sayı girin:&quot; yazıp,

In exchange, China will lower retaliatory tariffs on key Canadian agricultural products.</p><p>Experts told the BBC the move represents a significant shift in Canada's policy on China, one that is shaped by ongoing uncertainty with the US, its largest trade partner. </p><p>"The prime minister is saying, essentially, that Canada has agency too, and that it's not going to just sit and wait for the United States," said Eric Miller, a Washington DC based trade adviser and president of the Rideau Potomac Strategy Group.</p><ul><li><a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy59pvkqvl5o">China and Canada announce tariffs relief after high-stakes meeting</a></li><li><a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c98pj370mjjo">Carney faces delicate balancing act in China visit</a></li><li><a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czj0wjvjm4po">Four things the US wants from Canada on trade</a></li></ul></div><div data-component="text-block"><p><a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy59pvkqvl5o">Carney told reporters on Friday</a> that "the world has changed" in recent years, and the progress made with China sets Canada up "well for the new world order".</p><p>Canada's relationship with China, he added, had become "more predictable" than its relationship with the US under the Trump administration. </p><p>He later wrote, in a social media post, that Canada was "recalibrating" its relationship with China, "strategically, pragmatically, and decisively".</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>In Canada, as daylight broke on Friday, reaction to the deal was swift.</p><p>Some, like Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe, hailed it as "very good news". Farmers in Moe's province have been hard hit by China's retaliatory tariffs on Canadian canola oil, and the deal, he said, would bring much needed relief.</p><p>But Ontario Premier Doug Ford, whose province is home to Canada's auto sector, was sharply critical of the deal. He said removing EV tariffs on China "would hurt our economy and lead to job losses". </p><p>In a post on X, Ford said Carney's government was "inviting a flood of cheap made-in-China electric vehicles without any real guarantees of equal or immediate investment in Canada's economy". </p><p>Some experts said the electric vehicle provisions in the trade deal would help China make inroads into the Canadian automobile market.</p><p>With the lower EV tariffs, approximately 10% of Canada's electric vehicle sales are now expected to go to Chinese automakers, said Vivek Astvansh, a business professor at McGill University in Montreal.</p><p>The expected increase in Chinese EV sales could put pressure on US-based EV makers like Tesla which are seeking to expand their market share in Canada, he said.</p><p>"Carney has signalled to the Trump administration that it is warming up to China," Astvansh added.</p><p>Reaction from the White House, meanwhile, has been mixed.</p><p>In an interview with CNBC on Friday morning, US trade representative Jamieson Greer called the deal "problematic" and said Canada may come to regret it. </p><p>President Donald Trump, however, hailed it as "a good thing".</p><p>"If you can get a deal with China, you should do that," he told reporters outside the White House.</p><p>Since taking office for a second time last year, Trump has imposed tariffs on Canadian sectors like metals and automotives, which has led to swirling economic uncertainty. He has also threatened to rip up a longstanding North American free trade agreement between Canada, the US and Mexico, calling it "irrelevant".</p><p>That trade agreement, the USMCA, is now under a mandatory review. Canada and Mexico have both made clear they want it to remain in place. </p><p>But the decision to carve out a major new deal with China is a recognition by Carney that the future of North American free trade remains unclear, Miller of the Rideau Potomac Strategy Group told the BBC.</p><p>"There's a reasonable chance that we could end up in 2026 without a meaningful, workable trade deal with the United States," he said. "And Canada needs to be prepared."</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/20d8/live/7af6c940-f312-11f0-9c83-cf045898c668.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/20d8/live/7af6c940-f312-11f0-9c83-cf045898c668.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/20d8/live/7af6c940-f312-11f0-9c83-cf045898c668.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/20d8/live/7af6c940-f312-11f0-9c83-cf045898c668.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/20d8/live/7af6c940-f312-11f0-9c83-cf045898c668.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/20d8/live/7af6c940-f312-11f0-9c83-cf045898c668.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/20d8/live/7af6c940-f312-11f0-9c83-cf045898c668.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/20d8/live/7af6c940-f312-11f0-9c83-cf045898c668.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Getty Images Aerial view showing hundreds of new energy vehicles waiting to be loaded onto a ro-ro ship for export at Taicang Port on January 15, 2025 in Taicang, Suzhou City, Jiangsu Province of China."><span>Getty Images</span></p></div><p data-component="caption-block"><figcaption>China is the world's largest producer of EVs, accounting for over 70% of global production</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component="text-block"><p>The deal with China drops Canada's levies on Chinese EVs from 100% to 6.1% for the first 49,000 vehicles imported each year. That quota could rise, Carney said, reaching 70,000 in half a decade.</p><p>Canada and the US put levies on Chinese EVs in 2024, arguing that China was overproducing vehicles and undermining the ability of other countries to compete. </p><p>China is the world's largest producer of EVs, accounting for 70% of global production. </p><p>In exchange, China will cut tariffs on Canadian canola seed to around 15% by 1 March, down from the current rate of 84%. Carney said Beijing had also committed to removing tariffs on Canadian canola meal, lobsters, crabs and peas "until at least the end of the year". </p><p>China also committed to removing visa requirements for Canadian visitors, Carney said.</p><p>Beijing did not corroborate the details in a separate statement, but said "the two reached a preliminary joint agreement on addressing bilateral economic and trade issues". </p><p>The introduction of Chinese EVs to Canada's market will likely mean cheaper prices for Canadian consumers, said Gal Raz, an associate professor of Operations Management and Sustainability at Western University and an expert on the EV supply chain. </p><p>But Raz acknowledged that the deal Canada struck could hurt Canadian car manufacturers if it comes without further action from the Carney government to help the domestic sector. </p><p>He said it was the result of an "unfortunate" deterioration of the Canada-US trade relationship, which he noted has also hurt Canada's automotive industry.</p><p>"The US has really put Canada in a corner," he said.</p><p>Asked why Canada is giving China access to its automotive market, Carney said that China produces "some of the most affordable and energy-efficient vehicles in the world". He said he expects the deal will spur Chinese investment into Canada's auto industry, though he did not provide further details.</p><p>Trump himself has signalled openness to China building plants in the US if it means creating more jobs for Americans, despite his tough-on-China stance.</p><p>"If they want to come in and build a plant and hire you and hire your friends and your neighbours, that's great, I love that," Trump said at the Detroit Economic Club on Tuesday. "Let China come in, let Japan come in."</p><p>The US president is notably headed to Beijing for his own meeting with President Xi Jinping in April. He has also invited Xi for a state visit to Washington. </p><p>For Carney, though, Friday's deal may just be the first step in a "recalibration" of Canada's trade relations.</p><p><i id="with-additional-reporting-from-daniel-bush-in-washington"><b id="with-additional-reporting-from-daniel-bush-in-washington">With additional reporting from Daniel Bush in Washington</b></i></p></div></article></div>]]></description>
