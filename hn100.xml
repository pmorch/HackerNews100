<p><strong>Yesterday, Google announced to organisations that use its advertising products, that from 16 February 2025, it will no longer prohibit them from employing fingerprinting techniques. Our response is clear: businesses do not have free rein to use fingerprinting as they please. Like all advertising technology, it must be lawfully and transparently deployed – and if it is not, the ICO will act.</strong></p>
<p><span>Fingerprinting involves the collection of pieces of information about a device’s software or hardware, which, when combined, can uniquely identify a particular device and user.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The ICO’s view is that fingerprinting is not a fair means of tracking users online because it is likely to reduce people’s choice and control over how their information is collected. The change to Google’s policy means that fingerprinting could now replace the functions of third-party cookies.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We think this change is irresponsible. Google itself has previously said that fingerprinting does not meet users’ expectations for privacy, as users cannot easily consent to it as they would cookies. This in turn means they cannot control how their information is collected. To quote Google’s own position on fingerprinting from 2019: “We think this subverts user choice and is wrong.”</span></p>
<p><span>We are continuing to engage with Google on this U-turn in its position and the departure it represents from our expectation of a privacy-friendly internet. When the new policy comes into force on 16 February 2025, organisations using Google’s advertising technology will be able to deploy fingerprinting without being in breach of Google’s own policies. Given Google’s position and scale in the online advertising ecosystem, this is significant.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In the meantime, there should be no doubt around any business’s obligations when it comes to fingerprinting and privacy. Data protection law, including the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR), applies. Businesses must give users fair choices over whether to be tracked before using fingerprinting technology, including obtaining consent from their users where necessary.</span></p>
<p><span>We have taken the step of publishing draft guidance today on how data protection law, including PECR, applies to <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/direct-marketing-and-privacy-and-electronic-communications/guidance-on-the-use-of-storage-and-access-technologies/">storage and access technologies</a> such as fingerprinting. We’ll be launching a consultation on the guidance on Friday 20 December to give organisations the opportunity to feed back their thoughts.</span></p>
<p><span>Organisations seeking to deploy fingerprinting techniques for advertising will need to demonstrate how they are complying with the requirements of data protection law. These include providing users with transparency, securing freely-given consent, ensuring fair processing and upholding information rights such as the right to erasure.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Based on our understanding of how fingerprinting techniques are currently used for advertising this is a high bar to meet. Businesses should not consider fingerprinting a simple solution to the loss of third-party cookies and other cross-site tracking signals.</span></p>
<p><span>Our guidance forms part of the ICO’s upcoming strategy to give people meaningful control over how their information is used to show them personalised adverts. We will set out more details of our plans in the New Year.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Explainer: What does fingerprinting mean for the public?</h2>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Privacy controls are built around existing technologies. When you choose an option on a consent banner or ‘clear all site data’ in your browser, you are generally controlling the use of cookies and other traditional forms of local storage.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Fingerprinting, however, relies on signals that you cannot easily wipe. So, even if you ‘clear all site data’, the organisation using fingerprinting techniques could immediately identify you again. This is not transparent and cannot easily be controlled.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Fingerprinting is harder for browsers to block and therefore, even privacy-conscious users will find this difficult to stop.</span></li>

        <p>The year is 2025. The internet in the shape that we’ve known it in the early 2000s is no longer there. Or, not quite in the shape that we’ve seen it before. This is not just plain nostalgia talking - the vibrant ecosystem of blogs, feeds, personal sites, and forums has been usurped by a few mega-concentrated players.</p>
<p>Want to find a vibrant community around a very niche subject? It’s <em>probably</em> on Reddit. Or you know what - it could be Discord. Or both. Some still operate the occasional VBulletin on phpBB board, but that’s the minority. Want to buy or sell something? Your best bet is checking Facebook’s Marketplace (and of course, coordinate the purchase through Facebook’s Messenger, not email or any other means). Want to watch videos from some of your favorite makers? YouTube or bust. Anything outside of the ecosystem of these conglomerates is bound to naturally gain less visibility and it will be <em>insanely</em> less discoverable to large swaths of the population.</p>
<p>We’ve reached a point where, for quite a few folks, “the internet” is synonymous with “Facebook, Instagram, and Discord,” and if it’s not there, it might as well not exist. This shift introduces a range of problems, that we’ll talk about a bit more in this post.</p>
<p>I should also caveat the post with this disclaimer - the target audience here is people <strong>proficient with technology</strong>. For the <em>vast majority of the population</em> the <a href="#what-can-we-do">suggestions</a> I am going to be discussing are untenable in the current technological landscape, and that’s OK. My job is not to get <em>every single person to build their content outside the popular networks</em> but rather encourage those that were on the fence and able to make the jump into <strong>owning their own internet property</strong> rather than <strong>rent the space from someone who is not invested in their success</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="here-we-are">Here we are <span><a href="#here-we-are" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2>
<p>Now, this blog post’s intent is not to get you to stop using all “BigCo” services or convince you that the products made by these companies are <em>universally</em> evil or bad. They’re not. Being able to <em>reliably</em> watch videos on any platform or browser is great. I use YouTube and I publish quite a few videos there. I also use Reddit to connect with folks that enjoy Halo because there is <em>no other place</em> where that community hangs out. There are things that are simply done better when there is proper funding and a full-time staff working every day to maintain the infrastructure at scale, especially when talking about non-niche domains. That means that <em>by default</em> most people will not try to do this themselves. And they shouldn’t.</p>
<p>Running infrastructure for yourself is hard. Running infrastructure for <em>others</em> is <strong>exponentially</strong> harder. As any forum moderator or administrator can attest, the sheer volume of spam, abuse, and just generally trash behavior can wear down even the most seasoned veterans of the <code>.com</code> era. And that’s if we’re talking about communities that host <em>tens of thousands</em> of users. Scale that to a few million and there won’t be enough hours in the day to either keep the servers running (stuff is <em>costly</em> too) or to monitor the content for anything potentially harmful or inappropriate.</p>
<p>For anyone that wants to start a community, it’s a no-brainer that they should probably start somewhere where they can “outsource” the hard things, like moderation and infrastructure, to someone who is an expert and has built-in mechanisms to handle everything in-house. Especially when the funds for this are at or around zero dollars. That’s a totally reasonable stance to take, and I absolutely get the rationale there.</p>
<p>Not only that, but a lot of the existing ecosystems rest on the shoulders of network effects. Once everyone you care about is on Reddit, are you really going to be the only one <em>not</em> on Reddit and try to bootstrap your own little corner for a specific community? Probably not, and attracting people there would be much harder. Reddit is the one-stop-shop - I can go there for woodworking advice, but I can also chat in local communities, or communities around collecting stamps, with the same account and within the same interface. Are you really going to post photos of your fridge that you want to sell on your blog and hope that in a year someone discovers it through a Google search? Of course not - you will go to Facebook Marketplace or Craigslist and get it sold within a few days.</p>
<p>You, the user, are going to go where most people are, because you’re <strong>optimizing for solving your problems</strong>, such as finding like-minded individuals or selling the fridge quickly and getting it out of your garage to make room for a table saw. Most people are this way - they don’t care who or how maintains or runs a community or network as long as that place solves the problems they set out to solve. When that goal overlaps with the company’s desire to make money, you end up in somewhat of a <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/exoplanets/what-is-the-habitable-zone-or-goldilocks-zone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">goldilocks zone</a>, but that’s <em>typically</em> a short-lived experience with modern services. More on that shortly.</p>
<p>Knowing all this doesn’t mean that we should automatically absolve these companies from one very insidious thing that creeps up on us over time - <strong>being locked into walled gardens</strong>. If the last decade has shown us anything, it’s that a lot of these ecosystems are poorly suited to keep the <em>interest of the user</em> in mind for the long run. It all boils down to the fact that major platforms over time are usually interested in:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Constant growth (both monetary and engagement), at all costs</strong>. Ads are, quite literally, everywhere. YouTube is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1gct9ar/youtube_now_blocks_ublock_origin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fighting tooth and nail</a> (the irony of linking to Reddit is not lost on me) to prevent you, the user, from being able to block ads. AI-generated slop is going to make its way into <a href="https://www.404media.co/youtube-enhances-comment-section-with-ai-generated-nonsense/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">comments</a> and descriptions - arguably, things that nobody really asked for, but you’re going to get them anyway. Facebook and Instagram will soon have “<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/meta-ai-users-facebook-instagram-1235221430/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI users</a>” (whatever shape that’s going to take) to help “boost engagement.” The platforms are not interested in helping you, the customer, in easier and more robust communication with your family and friends. They want you to “engage” and drive the ad dollar revenue up.</li>
<li><strong>Keeping you within their walls and give you few chances to leave</strong>. Twitter doesn’t care about the fact that you poured your heart and soul in that one blog post and wanted to share it with your community. You post a link - <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/10/03/musk-x-links-long-form" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you get downranked</a>. Because that will cause people to <em>actually leave Twitter</em> to read your thinking, and that means they won’t be able to scroll through an ad-ridden feed. You ever wonder why Instagram doesn’t really let you post links? Yeah.</li>
<li><strong>Maximizing your attention and time <em>within</em> the ecosystem</strong>. <a href="https://newslit.org/tips-tools/news-lit-tip-engagement-bait/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Engagement bait</a> is everywhere, and the more engagement - the better! Why bubble up someone’s <em>real</em> thoughts and work when instead you can <a href="https://www.404media.co/where-facebooks-ai-slop-comes-from/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">push up more AI slop</a> that will get people angry, upset, and more likely to <em>engage</em> on your platform (the AI slop problem will get worse, but don’t worry, it will be “<a href="https://www.404media.co/zuckerberg-the-ai-slop-will-continue-until-morale-improves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a whole new category of content</a>”)?</li>
<li><strong>Hoovering up data about you</strong>. You can’t even browse a community without an account. Want to see someone’s photo feed on Instagram? Better be ready to sign up, or only see the latest few photos, with a persistent nag screen telling you to log in. Want to browse Facebook Marketplace for that homelab gear you’ve been looking for? Tough luck, you need a Facebook account to see listings, even if you’re not going to buy anything (contrast that to Craigslist). Want to see what a particular hobby community is chatting about? Discord doesn’t allow anonymous browsing, so once again - you need to create an account. Once you log in, there is now clear attribution of everything you do to an account. uBlock Origin and <a href="https://den.dev/blog/pihole/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pi-hole</a> can do a good job at blocking quite a few privacy-invading things, but they do nothing to prevent server-side telemetry collection that tracks your behavior on every page within the platform. Facebook knows exactly how long you spent browsing Marketplace before making a purchase, and in which area you live based on your history. Reddit can tell what you’re interested in based on the communities you browse and tailor ads based on that. Your profile is being built, and then sold (or “shared”) to a myriad of unscrupulous data brokers.</li>
<li><strong>Exploiting user-generated content</strong>. For example, when you upload an image to Instagram, you’re not transferring ownership rights to your creation to Meta, but you do give them <a href="https://help.instagram.com/581066165581870/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a license to use the content</a> - a “<em>non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of your content.</em>” Neat! Your art might end up in an ad you did not consent to, but you still retain the copyright. Or they might train their AI on it, who knows.</li>
</ol>
<p>The more walled gardens grow, the more the interest of the user fades, replaced by a strong drive for monetization and growth. So, why are these companies not keeping the interest of the user in mind, though, if the users are the ones <em>actually</em> building the communities? If it wouldn’t be for the users on those platforms wouldn’t those platforms disappear overnight, a fate that MySpace and Digg know a bit to well? Well, in the words of the modern philosopher <a href="https://youtu.be/zR7LOtMix9w?t=159" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dave Chappelle</a>:</p>

<p>Almost with no exceptions, you, the user, are unfortunately the product for social networks of any kind. And that’s not necessarily malice, but just a core design principle of walled gardens, applied generously as they grow. Walled gardens often start with good intentions, but once a critical mass of users settles, there is a strong desire to ensure that those users stick around <em>and</em> can produce a return on investment - those hosting bills aren’t going to pay themselves. That means that a lot of anti-user patterns will slowly start to emerge (not all at once, though), limiting the control over the experience, and by proxy, the benefits to its inhabitants. Say, at first posts with links will be deprioritized. Then, instead of showing your content in a chronological feed for your followers, your content will be shown at the mercy of a black box algorithm. Then, “premium” users will get boosted while non-paying users will be left to linger somewhere at the bottom of the discoverability stack. Before you know it, the oh-so-kind ecosystem that gave you an audience starts being hostile to you unless you pony up or play to the algorithm’s fiddle ("<em>Hey, how about making your thumbnails a bit more clickbait-y to drive some engagement?</em>").</p>
<p>At that point, the meta-goal is to <em>serve the company</em>, not <em>you</em>. You’re already hooked, and can’t move away without losing access to the network you built over the years. That’s a losing proposition for most people. Even looking at recent examples such as the massive exodus to Bluesky from Twitter required some <em>extremely strong</em> headwinds to emerge for that to happen, and it’s still unclear how permanent this change will be.</p>
<p>Jeff Atwood had a <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/avoiding-walled-gardens-on-the-internet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">good post</a> about this phenomenon all the way back in 2007. Who knew that little would change for close to two decades. And as the situation required, <a href="https://pluralistic.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cory Doctorow</a> has astutely coined the term that captures what is happening - “<em>enshittification</em>.” A product whose success is predicated on its ability to <em>constantly</em> grow may start with somewhat altruistic aspirations, but it inevitably will reach a point where the owners will need to make money off of its users, and that’s when the service will start turning the screws for the worse, with no way to escape without adverse effects. We’re at that point with basically every ecosystem I mentioned above.</p>
<p>We are tenants with landlords who want to make sure that we can’t leave the building or go hang out with friends elsewhere, all while showing us how happy we should be with the limitations imposed on us.</p>

<p>A <em>huge</em> part of the problem here is that, even in my framing, <strong>I am thinking like a person that works in tech</strong> and enjoys dabbling with technology. I host my blog. I self-host my data. I use a static site generator instead of a vanilla Wix or WordPress instance. I know my way around the terminal and can do a <code>npm run</code> to see what my site looks like before I push it to production. But I am not like most people. Not because I am special, but because most people <em>literally couldn’t care less</em> about the infrastructure, tools, privacy implications, or the fact that their content is not visible without an account.</p>
<p>That’s why I find advice like this useless:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Well of course it’s better to host your own blog! Also, while you’re at it, put your Mastodon server in a DigitalOcean droplet, throw some Cloudflare CDN in front of it, run your own Raspberry Pi to monitor uptime, and you’re golden! Oh, and don’t forget to also make sure to log into the droplet every once in a while to update the container, do an occasional database migration, and ensure that you check the logs for intrusions.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is about as helpful as someone recommending switching to Linux to someone who wants to improve their privacy posture (skip <code>/r/privacy</code> for your own sanity, by the way). Ask me why I used this analogy. You missed the forest for the trees.</p>
<p>No person that doesn’t work in tech (and <em>many</em> people that do) wants to deal with any of this. For most of us, we have a million other things we’d rather do in our life than stand up our own infrastructure to host a blog that gets 50 visits a month from our friends or family, or maintain a Mastodon server that you get charged for monthly to post random thoughts to a few hundred followers. It’s easier to just publish that as a long-form LinkedIn post. It’s easier to share the video on YouTube and not host it yourself on some web page and pay for the bandwidth of a multi-gigabyte MP4 file.</p>
<p>Most people are <strong>perfectly content</strong> with everything living inside their Facebook account because it’s <em>convenient</em> and <em>their family and friends are already there</em>. Telling everyone to learn how <code>git</code> and GitHub Pages work to host their blog is not an effective way to drive change. But that’s also not the point. As I mentioned earlier, the goal is to start with a small niche community of people who <em>are</em> comfortable with building their own digital corners.</p>
<h2 id="what-can-we-do">What can we do <span><a href="#what-can-we-do" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h2>
<p>The point I am trying to drive home is that we shouldn’t <a href="https://howtomarketagame.com/2021/11/01/dont-build-your-castle-in-other-peoples-kingdoms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">build our castle in someone else’s kingdom</a>.</p>
<p>Do not give full control of <em>your</em> content to the platforms that see you as a resource to be used to grow their own metrics. Here are a few rules that I set for myself, that I hope you also find helpful in making sure that you are a <strong>property owner</strong> on the internet rather than a mere renter in someone’s building. This is heavily inspired by the “<a href="https://howtomarketagame.com/2021/11/01/dont-build-your-castle-in-other-peoples-kingdoms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Don’t build your castle in other people’s kingdoms</a>” blog post by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chriszukowski/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chris Zukowski</a>, with a few extensions that I
amended from my own experience.</p>
<p>The items below also assume that you’re OK spending a bit of money and time on establishing your <em>more durable</em> presence online. There are, of course, free options, but anything free usually comes with quite a few strings attached that can put you in the same position I argued against above.</p>
<h3 id="1-have-your-own-property-on-the-web">1. Have your own property on the web <span><a href="#1-have-your-own-property-on-the-web" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3>
<p>Buy a domain and host your own website. It really doesn’t matter what you use for either the domain purchase or the hosting, as long as it’s <em>your property</em>. You can start with any of the site builders, host your own blog engine, or even use a static site generator like me. But as long as you have your own stake in the ground, you’re off to a good start. You don’t even need to be super technically proficient for this - platforms like Squarespace simplify this process quite a bit. And this is just one of them.</p>
<p>The domain registrar and the website host are <em>entirely</em> transparent to your friends and customers. If at some point your host decides to do something silly, you can take your website and move it elsewhere. Domains can be moved to other registrars too. You get quite a bit of flexibility there. Compare it to having all your eggs in the Twitter basket - if a new owner decides to take it in a direction you don’t agree with, and everyone leaves for Bluesky, you can’t take your Twitter followers and move them over. You’ll be forced to start from scratch.</p>
<p>In contrast, if at some point you want to change who hosts your site or which mail provider you use for your newsletter (thankfully emails are independent entities that can work on any platform), as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chriszukowski/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chris</a> put it in the <a href="https://howtomarketagame.com/2021/11/01/dont-build-your-castle-in-other-peoples-kingdoms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aforementioned blog post</a>, your customers “<em>[…] will still go to the same URL to get to your site, they will still receive your newsletter from your email address.</em>”</p>
<div>
  <p><img src="https://assets.den.dev/images/shared/stop.gif" alt="Mole out of the ground, thinking.">
  </p>
  <p>I am sure there are places where I should <strong>not</strong> host my content, no? What am I optimizing for here, exactly?</p>
</div>
<p>I would recommend avoiding any places where there is <em>content lock-in</em>. You want to optimize for <strong>future portability</strong>. That is, if you can’t easily export your full content history (e.g., blog posts) and move them somewhere else, don’t use that service. If your content is locked into a service, and at some point that service decides that you are no longer a wanted customer, all that effort you put into making it available to your customers can vanish on a moment’s notice. Prefer sites that allow you to publish in open formats, such as <a href="https://ghost.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghost</a>.</p>
<p>If you are going to use a service where the content is stored in a proprietary format that you can’t easily access wholesale, always maintain your own copy and export the hosted content regularly. You should be able to recover it on a new site shall anything happen to your current site.</p>
<div>
  <p><img src="https://assets.den.dev/images/shared/thinking.gif" alt="Mole out of the ground, thinking.">
  </p>
  <p>What about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain">top-level domain (TLD)</a>? Are there any particular things I need to consider before registering my own domain? Should I seek out a <code>.com</code> or is <code>.xyz</code> OK to use as well?</p>
</div>
<p>Great reminder! Yes, pick a TLD with a <em>generally</em> positive reputation and future durability! You want to make sure that both your <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/glossary/what-is-a-domain-name-registrar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>registrar</em></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_registry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>registry</em></a> are entities that can be more-or-less trusted to not disappear overnight. Any of the traditional <code>.com</code>, <code>.net</code>, or <code>.org</code> are great. <code>.dev</code>, like this blog is using, is good too. Certain country-specific TLDs (called ccTLDs, for “country code top-level domains”) are great as well, such as <code>.ca</code> for Canada (you need to be a Canadian permanent resident or citizen to register, though) or <code>.eu</code> for the European Union. TLDs such as <code>.xyz</code>, <code>.io</code>, or <code>.zip</code> (yes, it’s real, and it’s not spectacular) can be a bit more dicey due to things like association with spam content, dependence on <a href="https://thenewstack.io/what-is-the-future-of-the-io-domain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new political developments</a>, and just general mistrust. That’s not to say that you should <em>never</em> use them, but do prefer more established TLDs when possible.</p>
<p>As a best-practice, I would also <em>highly</em> recommend the separation of concerns in terms of <em>where you have your domain</em> and <em>where you host your content</em>. If you host your content with Cloudflare, don’t register the domain there - keep it on a registrar like <a href="https://porkbun.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Porkbun</a> or <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Namecheap</a>. That way if your account is terminated by the host for whatever reason, you’re not left holding the bag because you can’t even access your domain to point to another host.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and while I am at it - if you’re curious to see other places on the web where people established their homes, check out <a href="https://blogscroll.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BlogScroll</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to get your work seen in the modern era, it’s very likely that you <strong>have to</strong> use one of existing social networks with a significant user mass.</p>
<p>Speaking from my own experience, YouTube is doing a moderately good job at making sure that folks discover my video content where I interview guests for <a href="https://theworkitem.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my podcast</a>. But at the same time, I still host the podcast on my own site. The audio and video for the podcast is available for download to anyone, even if they are not on YouTube, and folks can find it on other aggregators as well. When I talk about the podcast, I don’t just bank on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNHIUc6KE64sUe5G0eP70aQ?sub_confirmation=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube</a> to bring eyes to my content - I talk about in on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/den.dev" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bluesky</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dendeli/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LinkedIn</a>, and even <a href="https://mastodon.social/@localden" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mastodon</a>. And within the recorded episodes, I refer people to <a href="https://theworkitem.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><code>theworkitem.com</code></a> as the destination they should check out for more content, not any of the networks. They can find pointers to those <em>from the website</em>.</p>
<p>This coming year, I will be integrating newsletters on both my blog and podcast because I’d like to build a way to connect <em>directly</em> to my audience without any middlemen. The mail provider is irrelevant because emails are universal and can be easily transferred between vendors on an as-needed basis.</p>
<p>Build that graph of diversified sources that have your personal site as the final destination for those that want to follow your adventures. Your site can feed those with new audience members, and vice-versa.</p>

</p>

<p>You also want to ensure that your site can contribute to audience growth on channels where folks are concentrated - if someone stumbles across your blog post on Hacker News, make it easy for them to find out that you are also on Mastodon or other networks where that visitor might already hang out. Decoupling from the influence of a single network ensures that you build a bit of resilience into your audience and content visibility.</p>
<p>The gist of this is simple - make sure that you’re not overly-focused on building an audience on just one channel, as any single point of failure can be catastrophic. As with everything in life (including finances and interpersonal relationships), diversification is key. Use Facebook, but also make sure that folks can find you on Bluesky. Sharing photo highlights on Instagram? Great, share them in a photo album on your blog as well and add a story behind it with a few links about the place you took the photo from.</p>
<p>This is also why I <em>love</em> that podcasts survived to this day in their proper RSS feed glory - no network can claim that they own the concept of a podcast. I can listen to my favorite podcasts on <em>any</em> of the available podcast apps because they’re just audio files linked in a XML file. That’s it. That’s as open as it gets. Anyone can host the files anywhere, and the feed itself can be created by anyone. And while I am certain that services like Spotify will continue to try to build a walled garden around the podcast ecosystem by having folks publish Spotify-exclusive shows or integrate Spotify-specific features that are not available across other podcast apps, I am happy to see that so far these efforts failed to gain any traction outside a few shows. The <em>vast</em> majority of podcasts live on an open network, and I can listen to them without a Spotify account.</p>
<p>And by the way, when I talk about using the existing social channels as a top of the audience funnel, feel zero shame about this tactic - remember when Facebook themselves <a href="https://locusmag.com/2023/01/commentary-cory-doctorow-social-quitting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">built a “bridge bot”</a> to funnel the MySpace network into their ecosystem?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Facebook addressed this problem by giving MySpace users who switched to Facebook a bridge between the two services. Simply give this tool your MySpace login and password, and it would use a bot to login to your MySpace account, scrape all the waiting messages in your queues and inbox, and push them into your Facebook feed. You could reply to these, and the bot would log back into MySpace and post those replies as you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Be as self-interested in growing <em>your space</em> as major networks are in growing theirs. Thankfully, despite the centralization, we also have a huge diversity of tools that enable you to do all sorts of nice things around <em>your</em> property, like mailing lists (<a href="https://buttondown.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Buttondown</a>, <a href="https://mailchimp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mailchimp</a>, and <a href="https://kit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kit</a> come to mind) and monetization systems (such as <a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stripe</a>, <a href="https://www.patreon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Patreon</a>, or <a href="https://gumroad.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gumroad</a>).</p>
<h3 id="3-dont-treat-external-networks-as-link-farms">3. Don’t treat external networks as link farms <span><a href="#3-dont-treat-external-networks-as-link-farms" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3>
<p>Everything I am saying here can be interpreted as “<em>post your content on your site, treat social networks like link farms to drive traffic to your site</em>” and that couldn’t be further from the truth.</p>
<p>Social media accounts that just post out-of-context links are of no interest to me and vast majority of people you probably care about. If I see an account do just that, it’s an instant unfollow. If I wanted <em>just links</em> I’d subscribe to a RSS feed. Funnily enough, this kind of behavior has been the downfall of a lot of “walled-off” communities that I’ve been a part of on Slack and Discord - people would use them to self-promote their blogs and other content, and it all became useless because on every visit, I’d see one hundred links with exactly zero conversation around it. That’s not the way to go.</p>
<p>Use other channels to <em>meaningfully engage</em> with the community. Answer their questions. Ask for feedback. Build rapport. You are <em>building a community</em>, not flooding the zone with self-promoting content. This will allow you to steer them to places that are more favorable to nurturing and growing your audience long-term.</p>
<h3 id="4-if-possible-build-the-core-of-your-value-in-your-own-yard-rather-than-someone-elses">4. If possible, build the core of your value in your own yard rather than someone else’s <span><a href="#4-if-possible-build-the-core-of-your-value-in-your-own-yard-rather-than-someone-elses" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3>
<p>I’ve seen this tactic applied by a few folks on YouTube and I think it’s brilliant. Say, you’re someone known for teaching people how to use CSS, JavaScript, or anything else. You post <em>some</em> content on YouTube, but make sure to promote the heck out of the courses that you manage on your own site (including monetization). This way, you skip the need to depend on a large network for your income <em>entirely</em> - you still maintain it as a top-of-funnel channel, but the <em>core</em> is on your own turf. You own the <em>distribution</em> while the “marketing” channels are nothing other than “plug-ins” in your system. You still want them to be reliable, but you’re not worried about one of them going offline.</p>

<p>This article is sprinkled with this idea, but to make it clear again - <strong>email is a universal protocol</strong> that you can take with you no matter where you go. If you have a mailing list of 1,000 community members that are interested in what you have to say, you can keep that forever (or, until they unsubscribe). A social media account can go “poof” in a week because the CEO decided that you’re not worth promoting anymore. Substack not to your liking? No problem - you take the emails and move them to Buttondown. Can’t quite do the same with an audience on <em>any</em> social network.</p>
<p>Anecdotally, people that entrusted you with their email address are also significantly more invested in reading/watching/listening to your content than an amalgam of followers across the social network landscape, but that could be recency bias.</p>
<p>Always lean towards open and portable standards.</p>

<p>Wrote a blog post? Don’t just copy and paste the entirety of the content as a LinkedIn post. Post an extract, and then a link to your site. Sharing a new podcast episode? Instead of linking to the YouTube video in your LinkedIn post promoting it, link to the episode page on your website, where people can see how to subscribe on their favorite podcast app, read through the episode transcript, or even check out the resources a guest might’ve shared. The ecosystems I talked about in this post should be your top-of-funnel for your audience.</p>
<p>Yes, some of your posts might be downranked, but that’s OK, because some of them won’t. I’ve seen people share my content on Bluesky and LinkedIn as a link, and it drove quite a few folks into my email inbox with suggestions, feedback, and ideas. Have links to your websites in your bio or anywhere where the networks allow you to customize things.</p>
<p>This is not about isolating yourself from the major networks, but rather using them to your advantage. My content lives in my home, and if you want to see more of it - come on over to <code>den.dev</code>.</p>

<p>If your building is overgrown with weeds, the sidewalk is cracked (congratulations, you have a tripping hazard), and the insides are covered in dust, the likelihood of quality visitors will decrease. The same applies to your internet property.</p>
<p>If you want to build an audience that keeps consistently coming back, make sure that your website, blog, portfolio, or photo gallery is in good shape. It doesn’t need to be pixel-perfect, but it needs to show that the author is still there, and there is a reason to stop by. If you post everything to YouTube, link to your site, and the site’s last content update was in 2004, that doesn’t inspire confidence that whoever found you on YouTube should also check out your blog - they’ll just see you on YouTube.</p>

<p>As much as I yearn for the era of proper forums to come back, it <em>might be</em> a lost war at scale. But I don’t need to win the war - I want to engage with a niche audience of folks that care about what I build. For that, as much as possible, leverage tools that foster open engagement that can be discoverable and indexable. <a href="https://www.discourse.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Discourse</a> is a fantastic option. If you’re on a budget, integrate comments as GitHub issues on your blog with the help of <a href="https://utteranc.es/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Utterances</a>, like you see here, on <a href="https://den.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><code>den.dev</code></a>.</p>
<p>The latter has been particularly great for my blog. On one occasion I had a <a href="https://github.com/dend/blog-comments/issues/5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">very long chat</a> with a community member about Halo film format reverse engineering - all easily available to anyone in the future.</p>
<p>Avoid locking in your community into a Discord, Slack, or any other proprietary and hidden service that keeps your content locked in.</p>

<p>Having your own corner of the internet is not some kind of “purity test” where you need to set up an Apache server from scratch, host your mail server, or maintain your own homegrown static site generator running on seventeen generations of Gentoo Linux.</p>
<p>At some point, you will have to depend on other systems and let go of full control. You might use Azure for hosting, Porkbun for domains, a Cloudflare CDN for your images, GitHub for your content backups, AWS S3 for larger files, and so on. I am by no means trying to push you to build your garage server and deal with all the things that come with that decision.</p>

<p>The goal is to give you an opportunity to build something that <em>you have full control of</em> with a <em>good degree of flexibility</em>, all while using <em>off-the-shelf tools and services</em>. None of the services or tools are guaranteed future-proof. Just like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eminent_domain" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">extreme circumstances</a> can result in you losing your <em>purchased house</em> (the analogy falls apart in that the government would <em>pay</em> for the property in Eminent Domain cases, but you get the idea), the same can happen with online properties. But it still offers much greater flexibility than depending on some third-party platform to keep your interest at the forefront of their plans.</p>

<p>Your site is not going to be perfect from day one. You are going to run into hiccups with discoverability. You’ll find out that nobody can find it on Google for the first month. That’s OK. You can pull through this. Keep writing and posting about things you learned, things you saw, or things you’ve otherwise experienced. Document <a href="https://foone.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">your process</a>. Share your <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">notes</a>. Write up your brain dump from this weekend’s brainstorm.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-permalink-context="/2025/Jan/2/they-spy-on-you-but-not-like-that/">

<p>2nd January 2025</p>



<p>One of my weirder hobbies is trying to convince people that the idea that companies are listening to you through your phone’s microphone and serving you targeted ads is a conspiracy theory that isn’t true. I wrote about this previously: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Dec/14/ai-trust-crisis/#facebook-dont-spy-microphone">Facebook don’t spy on you through your microphone</a>.</p>
<p>(Convincing people of this is basically impossible. It doesn’t matter how good your argument is, if someone has ever seen an ad that relates to their previous voice conversation they are likely convinced and there’s nothing you can do to talk them out of it. Gimlet media did <a href="https://gimletmedia.com/amp/shows/reply-all/z3hlwr">a great podcast episode</a> about how impossible this is back in 2017.)</p>
<p>This is about to get even harder thanks to this proposed settlement: <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/apple-agrees-to-pay-95m-delete-private-conversations-siri-recorded/">Siri “unintentionally” recorded private convos; Apple agrees to pay $95M</a> (Ars Technica).</p>
<p>Apple are settling for $95m (nine hours of profit), agreeing to settle while “denying wrongdoing”.</p>
<p>What actually happened is it turns out Apple were capturing snippets of audio surrounding the “Hey Siri” wake word, sending those back to their servers and occasionally using them for QA, without informing users that they were doing this. This is bad.</p>
<p>The Reuters 2021 story <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-must-face-siri-voice-assistant-privacy-lawsuit-us-judge-2021-09-02/">Apple must face Siri voice assistant privacy lawsuit -U.S. judge</a> reported that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One Siri user said his private discussions with his doctor about a “brand name surgical treatment” caused him to receive targeted ads for that treatment, while two others said their discussions about Air Jordan sneakers, Pit Viper sunglasses and “Olive Garden” caused them to receive ads for those products.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The claim from that story was then repeated in <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/apple-pay-95-million-settle-siri-privacy-lawsuit-2025-01-02/">the 2025 Reuters story</a> about the settlement.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/apple-agrees-to-pay-95m-delete-private-conversations-siri-recorded/">Ars Technica story</a> reframes that like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The only clue that users seemingly had of Siri’s alleged spying was eerily accurate targeted ads that appeared after they had just been talking about specific items like Air Jordans or brands like Olive Garden, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/apple-pay-95-million-settle-siri-privacy-lawsuit-2025-01-02/">noted</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Crucially, this was never <em>proven in court</em>. And if Apple settle the case it never will be.</p>
<p>Let’s think this through. For the accusation to be true, Apple would need to be recording those wake word audio snippets and transmitting them back to their servers for additional processing (likely true), but then they would need to be feeding those snippets <em>in almost real time</em> into a system which forwards them onto advertising partners who then feed that information into targeting networks such that next time you view an ad on your phone the information is available to help select the relevant ad.</p>
<p>That is <em>so far fetched</em>. Why would Apple do that? Especially given both their brand and reputation as a privacy-first company combined with the large amounts of product design and engineering work they’ve put into preventing apps from doing exactly this kind of thing by enforcing permission-based capabilities <em>and</em> ensuring a “microphone active” icon is available at all times when an app is listening in.</p>
<p>I really don’t think this is happening—in particular for Siri wake words!</p>

<p id="argued-these-points">I’ve <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Dec/14/ai-trust-crisis/#facebook-dont-spy-microphone">argued these points before</a>, but I’ll do it again here for good measure.</p>
<ol>
<li>You don’t notice the hundreds of times a day you say something and <em>don’t</em> see a relevant advert a short time later. You see thousands of ads a day, can you remember what <em>any</em> of them are?</li>
<li>The tiny fraction of times where you see an ad that’s relevant to something you’ve just said (hence breaking through your filter that prevents you from seeing most ads at all) stick in your head.</li>
<li>Human beings are pattern matching machines with a huge bias towards personal anecdotes. If we’ve seen direct evidence of something ourselves, good luck talking us out of it!</li>
</ol>
<p>I think the truth of the matter here is much more pedestrian: the quality of ad targeting that’s possible just through apps sharing data on your regular actions within those apps is shockingly high... combined with the fact that it turns out just knowing “male, 40s, NYC” is often more than enough—we’re all pretty basic!</p>
<p>I fully expect that this Apple story will be used as “proof” by conspiracy theorists effectively forever.</p>

<p>At the end of 2024, Harold Aptroot posted this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apparently shlx is a "medium latency" (3 cycles) instruction on Alder Lake. My disappointment is immeasurable, and my day is ruined.</p>
<p>— <a href="https://x.com/HaroldAptroot/status/1873461353203302819">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/haroldaptroot.bsky.social/post/3leht4lp2dk2u">Bluesky</a> / <a href="https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@harold/113737900853968212">Mastodon</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was immediately <a href="https://xkcd.com/356/">nerd sniped</a> because I am into low-level performance analysis, and I happen to own an Alder Lake laptop.</p>
<p>A bit of background: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alder_Lake"><em>Alder Lake</em></a> is the 12th generation of Intel Core processors.
It's the first generation with a "hybrid architecture," containing both performance (P) and efficiency (E) cores.
<a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/sarx:shlx:shrx"><code>SHLX</code></a> is a left-shift instruction introduced in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_Bit_manipulation_instruction_set#BMI2_(Bit_Manipulation_Instruction_Set_2)">BMI2</a> instruction set.
The main difference with <a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/sal:sar:shl:shr"><code>SHL</code></a> is that <code>SHLX</code> doesn't affect the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLAGS_register">FLAGS</a> register.
It's also a 3-operand instruction:</p>
<pre><code>        SHL  RAX, CL       ; RAX = RAX &lt;&lt; CL
                           ; (only CL allowed as shift count)

        SHLX RAX, RBX, RDX ; RAX = RBX &lt;&lt; RDX
                           ; (any register allowed as shift count)
</code></pre>
<p>Left-shift is one of the simplest things to implement in hardware, so it's quite surprising that it should take 3 whole CPU cycles.
It's been 1 cycle on every other CPU I'm aware of.
It's even 1 cycle on Alder Lake's <em>efficiency cores</em>!
Only the performance cores have this particular performance problem.</p>
<p>The 3-cycle figure Harold cited comes from <a href="https://uops.info/html-instr/SHLX_R64_R64_R64.html#ADL-P">uops.info</a>.
They even document the exact <a href="https://uops.info/html-lat/ADL-P/SHLX_R64_R64_R64-Measurements.html#lat2-%3E1">instruction sequence</a> used in their benchmark that measured the 3-cycle latency, with a sample <a href="https://github.com/andreas-abel/nanoBench">nanoBench</a> command to reproduce it.
Running that command on my laptop indeed measures 3 cycles of latency.</p>
<p>On the other hand, other sources (like <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/content-details/671488/intel-64-and-ia-32-architectures-optimization-reference-manual-volume-1.html">Intel</a> and <a href="http://users.atw.hu/instlatx64/GenuineIntel/GenuineIntel00906A4_AlderLakeP_00_BC_InstLatX64.txt">InstLatX64</a>) claim the latency is 1 cycle.
What gives?
I decided to write my own benchmark to try to understand the discrepancy.</p>
<pre><code>.intel_syntax noprefix
.globl main
main:
        MOV RDX, 10000     ; RDX = 10000
        XOR RAX, RAX       ; RAX = 0
.LOOP:
        MOV RCX, 1         ; RCX = 1
.rept 10000
        SHLX RAX, RAX, RCX ; RAX = RAX &lt;&lt; RCX
                           ; (repeated 10,000 times)
.endr
        DEC RDX
        JNZ .LOOP          ; (loop 10,000 times)
        XOR EAX, EAX
        RET                ; return 0
</code></pre>
<p>This code contains an outer loop with 10,000 iterations.
Inside the loop, we initialize <code>RCX</code> to 1, then run <code>SHLX RAX, RAX, RCX</code> 10,000 times.
In total, we run <code>SHLX</code> 10,000,000 times, so all the other instructions (including the ones before <code>main()</code> runs) are negligible.
I used <code>taskset -c 0</code> to pin it to a P core, and <code>perf</code> for measurement:</p>
<pre><code>$ gcc shlx.s -o shlx
$ taskset -c 0 perf stat --cputype=core -e 'cycles,instructions' ./shlx

 Performance counter stats for './shlx':

       301,614,809      cpu_core/cycles:u/
       100,155,910      cpu_core/instructions:u/         #    0.33  insn per cycle
</code></pre>
<p>Here we see 0.33 instructions per cycle, a.k.a. 3-cycle latency.</p>
<p>Let's try initializing <code>RCX</code> differently:</p>
<pre><code> .LOOP:
-        MOV RCX, 1
+        MOV ECX, 1
</code></pre>
<p><code>ECX</code> is the 32-bit low half of the 64-bit <code>RCX</code> register.
On x86-64, writing a 32-bit register implicitly sets the upper half of the corresponding 64-bit register to zero.
So these two instructions should behave identically.
And yet:</p>
<pre><code> Performance counter stats for './shlx':

       100,321,870      cpu_core/cycles:u/
       100,155,867      cpu_core/instructions:u/         #    1.00  insn per cycle
</code></pre>
<p>It seems like <code>SHLX</code> performs differently depending on how the shift count register is initialized.
If you use a 64-bit instruction with an immediate, performance is slow.
This is also true for instructions like <code>INC</code> (which is similar to <code>ADD</code> with a 1 immediate).</p>
<pre><code> .LOOP:
-        MOV RCX, 1
+        XOR RCX, RCX
+        INC RCX
</code></pre>
<pre><code> Performance counter stats for './shlx':

       300,138,108      cpu_core/cycles:u/
       100,165,881      cpu_core/instructions:u/         #    0.33  insn per cycle
</code></pre>
<p>On the other hand, 32-bit instructions, and 64-bit instructions without immediates (even no-op ones), make it fast.
All of these ways to initialize RCX lead to 1-cycle latency:</p>
<pre><code>.LOOP:
        MOV ECX, 1
</code></pre>
<pre><code>.LOOP:
        XOR RCX, RCX
</code></pre>
<pre><code>.LOOP:
        MOV RCX, 1
        MOV RCX, RCX
</code></pre>
<pre><code>        MOV RCX, 1
.LOOP:
        PUSH RCX
        POP RCX
</code></pre>
<p>It is very strange to me that the <em>instruction used to set the shift count register</em> can make the <code>SHLX</code> instruction 3× slower.
The 32-bit vs. 64-bit operand size distinction is especially surprising to me as <code>SHLX</code> only looks at the bottom 6 bits of the shift count.</p>
<p>I do not have a good explanation for this yet, but I will update this page if I ever figure it out.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article data-astro-cid-p5zaeqd4=""><p>Life has been a haze this last year. After selling my company, I find myself in the totally un-relatable position of never having to work again. Everything feels like a side quest, but not in an inspiring way. I don’t have the same base desires driving me to make money or gain status. I have infinite freedom, yet I don’t know what to do with it, and, honestly, I’m not the most optimistic about life.</p>
<p>I know. This is a completely zeroth-world position to be in. The point of this post isn’t to brag or gain sympathy. To be honest, I don’t exactly know what the point of this post is. I tried to manufacture one, but I just felt like a phony. Then I recognized the irony of creating purpose out of a blog post when I don’t currently have much conviction or purpose in life.</p>
<p>So I’ll just go ahead and explain my current situation for my own selfish purposes. To push myself to be completely (and awkwardly) vulnerable to a blob of nameless strangers over the internet. No expectations of what comes out of it.</p>
<h2 id="going-to-the-redwoods-and-giving-up-60m">Going to the redwoods and giving up $60m</h2>
<p>Last March I had no idea what to do with my life. I knew that staying at the acquiring company was not it for me for the big company reasons you might suspect (lots of politics, things moved slowly, NPC coworkers, etc.), but I found it very hard to give up a $60m pay package. I had already made more money than I knew what to do with, but your mind does funny things when you start to consider numbers like this.</p>
<p>So I decided to go to the redwoods and figure it out.</p>
<p>Within 5 minutes of my first hike, the trees smiled at me and whispered their simple wisdom.</p>
<p>What is the point of money if it not for freedom?</p>
<p>What is your most scarce resource if not time?</p>
<p>I would leave to do something. Anything. To be alive again. I had no idea. But I was hell bent on making sure everyone knew I had it all figured out. Out of ego. Out of fear of wading into the unknown. When you work on something that consumes your life for a decade, it’s hard to let go of the certainty and purpose you’ve grown accustomed to.</p>
<h2 id="robotics-or-my-cringe-trying-to-be-elon-phase">Robotics, or my cringe “trying to be Elon” phase</h2>
<p>The immediate 2 weeks after leaving an intense 10-year journey, I did what any healthy person does and met with over 70 investors and founders in robotics. I had been learning about robotics for quite some time and was positive I wanted to throw myself into giving computers arms and legs. I had come up with all the tag lines to delude myself into thinking this was my “life’s calling”. Everything had been “leading to this exact point”.</p>
<p>“The world is going through a major labor shortage!”</p>
<p>“We must stay competitive against China!”</p>
<p>“The market for highly repetitive labor is multiple trillions of dollars.”</p>
<p>At the end of the 2 weeks, I left feeling deflated and foolish. I didn’t want to start a robotics company. The only thing that seemed interesting to me was humanoids. It started to dawn on me that what I actually wanted was to look like Elon, and that is incredibly cringe. It hurts to even type this out.</p>
<h2 id="breaking-up-with-my-girlfriend-and-realizing-im-very-insecure">Breaking up with my girlfriend and realizing I’m very insecure</h2>
<p>After deciding to not start a robotics company, I found myself rudderless. No sense of direction. I traveled to many beautiful places with my loving and supportive (ex) girlfriend. This 6 month stretch could be several essays on its own, but the outcome of this period is that nothing seemed right.</p>
<p>We started getting into regular arguments, and I knew it wasn’t on her. It was me. I was starting to come to terms with all the mounting insecurities I had stuffed down over the past several years. I didn’t feel like I could work on them with her. So I broke things off after almost 2 years of unconditional love. It was extremely painful, but it was the right call. I needed to fully face myself.</p>
<p>I have only started to realize that, when Loom was in its early innings, I felt very secure with my position in life, and lots of this stemmed from an extreme gratitude for the journey I was on. I was happy with everything as it was. The growth trajectory of the company was more than I could ever dream for. I was happy. I felt secure. It could all turn to shit the next day, and that would be ok.</p>
<p>Then, as the company continued to skyrocket to new heights, I started to have growing expectations for myself, and others started to have growing expectations of me. When we went through our first round of layoffs, this company my ego was hitched to had suffered a massive blow, so I lost myself. This whole chapter of Loom has created a complex web of internalized insecurities I must now work hard to disentangle and free myself from.</p>
<p>(If my ex is reading this. Thank you for everything. I am sorry I couldn’t be what you needed me to be.)</p>
<h2 id="climbing-mountains-in-the-himalayas-remembering-to-do-hard-things">Climbing mountains in the Himalayas, remembering to do hard things</h2>
<p>After breaking up with my girlfriend, I did what any healthy person would do and decided to externalize my emotions by climbing a 6800m peak in the Himalayas with absolutely no mountaineering experience or training. In the earliest stages of trekking into the valley, before the altitude sickness, cold, and chronic bronchitis started to settle in, this seemed like the best idea in the world. It wasn’t until every person I met along the way asked how long I had been training for, that it started to settle in how insane what I was doing was.</p>
<p>Needless to say, there were some rough patches. I got very hypoxic on one of my summits and had to repel down cliff faces while tripping out of my mind. In the end, I pushed through, completed both my planned summits, and got reacquainted with how important doing hard things is to me. It is the heart beat of my life, and I don’t 100% understand why, but it probably has something to do with me having not the best childhood.</p>
<p>When I got back home and regaled my friends with my mountain stories, one of my friends joked that I should work for Elon and Vivek at DOGE and help America get off its current crash to defaulting on its own debt. So I reached out to some people and got in. After 8 calls with people who all talked fast and sounded very <del>autistic</del> smart, I was added to a number of Signal groups and immediately put to work.</p>
<h2 id="working-for-doge-for-4-weeks-remembering-the-power-of-urgency">Working for DOGE for 4 weeks, remembering the power of urgency</h2>
<p>Within 2 minutes of talking to the final interviewer for DOGE, he asked me if I wanted to join. I said “yes”. Then he said “cool” and I was in multiple Signal groups. I was immediately acquainted with the software, HR, and legal teams and went from 0 to 100 taking meetings and getting shit done. This was the day before Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>The next 4 weeks of my life consisted of 100s of calls recruiting the smartest people I’ve ever talked to, working on various projects I’m definitely not able to talk about, and learning how completely dysfunctional the government was. It was a blast.</p>
<p>I learned about the power of urgency and having an undeniable mission. Not by reading it somewhere. By experiencing it. I came to realize how laughable my robotics stint had been in comparison. And I started to realize that, although the mission of DOGE is extremely important, it wasn’t the most important thing I needed to focus on with urgency for myself. I needed to get back to ambiguity, focus on my insecurities, and be ok with that for a while. DOGE wasn’t going to fix that.</p>
<p>So, after 4 intense and intoxicating weeks, I called off my plans to move to DC and embark on a journey to save our government with some of the smartest people I’ve ever met. And I booked a 1-way ticket to Hawaii.</p>
<h2 id="studying-physics-in-the-jungle-focusing-on-my-insecurities">Studying physics in the jungle, focusing on my insecurities</h2>
<p>So now I’m in Hawaii. I’m learning physics. Why? The reason I tell myself is to build up my first principles foundation so I can start a company that manufactures real world things. It seems plausible, but I’m learning to just accept that I am happy learning physics. That’s the goal in and of itself. If it leads to nothing, that’s ok. If this means I’ll never do something as spectacular as Loom, so be it. It’s been too long since I’ve been completely raw and real with myself, so I’m applying a healthy dose of humility to everything I say and do. It’s the only thing that feels authentic.</p>
<p>However, there are some questions left unanswered.</p>
<p>Why did I need to do the absolute most to reach this point?</p>
<p>Why couldn’t I just leave Loom and say “I don’t know what I want to do next”?</p>
<p>Why do I feel the need to only be on a journey if it’s grand?</p>
<p>What is wrong with being insignificant?</p>
<p>Why is letting people down so hard?</p>
<p>I don’t know. But I’m going to find out.</p></article></div>]]></description>

Council, Inc</em>., 467 U.S. 837 (1984) ) … Using ‘the traditional tools of statutory construction,’ id., we hold that Broadband Internet Service Providers offer only an ‘information service’ under 47 U.S.C. § 153(24), and therefore, the FCC lacks the statutory authority to impose its desired net-neutrality policies through the ‘telecommunications service'’ provision of the Communications Act, id. § 153(51). Nor does the Act permit the FCC to classify mobile broadband—a subset of broadband Internet services—as a ‘commercial mobile service’ under Title III of the Act (and then similarly impose net-neutrality restrictions on those services). Id. § 332(c)(1)(A). We therefore grant the petitions for review and set aside the FCC's Safeguarding Order.”</p><p>Following the ruling, FCC chair Jessica Rosenworcel said in a statement: “Consumers across the country have told us again and again that they want an internet that is fast, open and fair. With this decision it is clear that Congress now needs to heed their call, take up the charge for net neutrality and put open internet principles in federal law.”</p><div data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-tZvgk9neL4gU9kRcnfSCZb"><section><p>The professional video industry's #1 source for news, trends and product and tech information.

When I eventually made the switch to digital (documented in </span><a href="https://nsavage.substack.com/p/zettelgarden-and-retrieval-augmented" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">a previous post</a><span>), it wasn't a simple "upgrade." Instead, I found myself constantly comparing what I gained and lost in the transition. </span></p><p>The benefits of digital were obvious: searching through thousands of notes instantly, copying and linking without physical constraints, and being able to access everything from anywhere. But something less tangible was lost in the process. </p><p>There's this fascinating aspect of physical card systems that I never appreciated until it was gone: the power of proximity. When you're flipping through physical cards, you naturally see the notes around the one you're looking for. Cards 100 and 101 might be completely unrelated in content, but your brain can't help but see them together. Sometimes this creates unexpected connections - you might realize that card 500, which relates to card 100, could have an interesting relationship with card 101 too. </p><p>This serendipitous discovery is harder to replicate digitally. Sure, we can add previous/next buttons or show related notes, but it's not quite the same. On a screen, everything is intentional - you have to choose to look at related content. With paper cards, these connections are essentially forced upon you, and that's not always a bad thing. </p><p>It's reminiscent of Luhmann's original zettelkasten system, where physical proximity created a kind of "neighbor effect" that digital systems struggle to replicate. Screen real estate is precious, and we can't easily show everything at once without creating overwhelming interfaces. </p><p>While building Zettelgarden, I've been trying to find ways to capture this serendipitous discovery while maintaining the clear advantages of digital systems. It's not about perfectly replicating the paper experience - that's probably impossible and maybe not even desirable. Instead, it's about understanding what made these physical systems work so well and finding new ways to achieve similar benefits in a digital context. </p><p>The explosion of AI tools has brought us to an interesting crossroads in knowledge management. There's an almost irresistible temptation to automate everything - after all, if an AI can read an article and generate perfect notes, why shouldn't it? The technology is certainly moving in that direction. </p><p>But I've been increasingly skeptical of this "automate everything" approach. Here's why: Many of the current RAG-based solutions suffer from what I call the scaling problem. When you're dealing with ten notes, it's trivial to dump them into an LLM and generate connections. With a hundred notes, it's still manageable. But what happens when you hit 10,000 notes? Or a million? We quickly run into the limitations of context windows and processing capacity. Vector search helps narrow things down, but it's prone to missing important connections that a human mind might naturally make. </p><p>There's also a more fundamental issue here. When you automatically generate notes from an article, what have you really accomplished? You've essentially created a slightly reorganized version of the original content. But personal knowledge management isn't just about storing information - it's about processing it, understanding it, and making it your own. </p><p>This brings me to what I believe should be at the core of Zettelgarden. Your notes should be exactly that - yours. They shouldn't just be facts pulled from articles; they should include your commentary, your insights, and your connections to other ideas. </p><p>Let me give you an example of how I structure my own notes: Card X might contain a fact or concept from something I've read. But Card X.1 will be my thoughts on that fact - why it matters, what it implies, where it might be wrong. Card X.2 might explore how this connects to something completely different I've encountered elsewhere. This commentary and these connections are where the real value lies. </p><p>This is why I'm resistant to workflows that involve importing an article and automatically generating dozens of cards from it. Sure, it's efficient, but what have you learned in the process? A zettelkasten shouldn't be a mirror of the world's knowledge - it should be a reflection of your understanding of that knowledge. </p><p>Throughout the industrial revolution and into our digital age, we've consistently pushed to automate as much as possible. And generally speaking, that's been a good thing - I'm certainly not arguing we should go back to manual accounting ledgers or card catalogs. But with knowledge work, and specifically with personal knowledge management, I think we need to be more thoughtful about where we draw that line between human and machine tasks. </p><p>The key is identifying what I call the "drudge work" - the mechanical tasks that don't contribute to understanding. Searching through thousands of notes to find a specific reference? Let the machine handle that. Converting your thoughts into typed text? Sure, typing is probably more efficient than handwriting (though there's an interesting discussion to be had about the cognitive benefits of handwriting, which I'll save for another time). Managing links between notes? Computers are great at that. </p><p>But the core activities of reading, understanding, synthesizing, and making connections? That should remain firmly in human hands. Not because machines can't do these things - they increasingly can - but because doing these things is precisely how we learn and develop new insights. </p><p>I'm developing Zettelgarden as an open-source project to create something that thoughtfully augments human intelligence rather than replacing it. Think of it as a partnership: the computer handles the organizational heavy lifting, while you focus on the thinking. </p><p>This approach is particularly valuable for companies managing their internal knowledge bases. Organizations often struggle with maintaining and accessing their collective knowledge effectively. Zettelgarden's philosophy of human-centric knowledge management, combined with powerful digital organization, makes it an ideal solution for teams looking to build and maintain their knowledge bases while preserving the human element of understanding and insight. </p><p>I'm still working through some challenging problems. How do I make serendipitous discovery feel natural in a digital environment? How do I handle scaling issues as note collections grow? How do I incorporate AI features in a way that enhances rather than shortcuts the learning process? </p><p>I'm increasingly convinced that the future of knowledge management isn't about offloading everything to machines, but about finding the right balance. We need tools that respect the importance of human engagement while eliminating the friction that gets in the way of thinking and creating. </p><p>The goal isn't to have the world's knowledge at your fingertips - we already have that with Google and Wikipedia. The goal is to have your understanding of the world's knowledge at your fingertips, enhanced by your own insights and connections. That's what makes a zettelkasten valuable, and that's what I'm building Zettelgarden to achieve. </p><p><span>You can check out Zettelgarden either on its </span><a href="https://zettelgarden.com/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">website</a><span> or check it out on Github: </span><a href="https://github.com/NickSavage/Zettelgarden" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">https://github.com/NickSavage/Zettelgarden</a></p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Language models (LMs) are powerful tools for natural language processing, but they often struggle to produce coherent and fluent text when they are small. Models with around 125M parameters such as GPT-Neo (small) or GPT-2 (small) can rarely generate coherent and consistent English text beyond a few words even after extensive training. This raises the question of whether the emergence of the ability to produce coherent English text only occurs at larger scales (with hundreds of millions of parameters or more) and complex architectures (with many layers of global attention).
<br>In this work, we introduce TinyStories, a synthetic dataset of short stories that only contain words that a typical 3 to 4-year-olds usually understand, generated by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. We show that TinyStories can be used to train and evaluate LMs that are much smaller than the state-of-the-art models (below 10 million total parameters), or have much simpler architectures (with only one transformer block), yet still produce fluent and consistent stories with several paragraphs that are diverse and have almost perfect grammar, and demonstrate reasoning capabilities.
<br>We also introduce a new paradigm for the evaluation of language models: We suggest a framework which uses GPT-4 to grade the content generated by these models as if those were stories written by students and graded by a (human) teacher. This new paradigm overcomes the flaws of standard benchmarks which often requires the model's output to be very structures, and moreover provides a multidimensional score for the model, providing scores for different capabilities such as grammar, creativity and consistency.
<br>We hope that TinyStories can facilitate the development, analysis and research of LMs, especially for low-resource or specialized domains, and shed light on the emergence of language capabilities in LMs.

the <code>connet</code> client runs on both the device that exposes the service (called <code>destination</code> in connet's terms)
and the device that wants to access the service (called <code>source</code>). This means that communication between <code>connet</code>
clients is never public and visible to the rest of the internet, and in many cases peers can communicate directly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Status</strong> <code>connet</code> is currently alpha software. We expect some issues and its APIs are subject to change.</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Peer-to-peer communication</strong> Because you run the <code>connet</code> client on both the <code>destination</code> and the <code>source</code>, the server
is only used for sharing configuration. In many cases clients can communicate directly, which enables better privacy and
performance.</li>
<li><strong>Relay support</strong> There are cases when clients are unable to find a path to communicate directly. In such cases, they
can use a relay server to maintain connectivity.</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong> Everything is private, encrypted with TLS. Public server and client certificates are exchanges between peers
and are required and verified to establish connectivity. Clients and relays need to present a mandatory token when communicating
with the control server, allowing tight control over who can use <code>connet</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Embeddable</strong> In case you want <code>connet</code> running as part of another (golang) program (as opposed to a separate executable),
<code>connet</code> has a well defined api for running both the client and the server.</li>

<p dir="auto">For all communication <code>connet</code> uses the QUIC protocol, which is build on top of UDP.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Quickstart</h2><a id="user-content-quickstart" aria-label="Permalink: Quickstart" href="#quickstart"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Latest builds of <code>connet</code> can be acquired from our <a href="https://github.com/connet-dev/connet/releases">releases</a> page.
If you are using <a href="https://nixos.org/" rel="nofollow">NixOS</a>, check also the <a href="#NixOS">NixOS</a> section.</p>
<p dir="auto">To get started with <code>connet</code>, you'll need 3 devices:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Server which your clients can communicate with. In most cases, this server will have a public IP and be directly
accessible by clients. A VPS instance at one of the many cloud providers goes a long way here.</li>
<li>Device <code>D</code> that has the <code>destination</code> service you want to connect to, running at port <code>3000</code>.</li>
<li>Device <code>S</code> (aka <code>source</code>) which you want to connect to the service, at port <code>8000</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Server</h3><a id="user-content-server" aria-label="Permalink: Server" href="#server"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">In the setup above, start <code>connet server --config server.toml</code> with the following <code>server.toml</code>:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="[server]
tokens = [&quot;client-d-token&quot;, &quot;client-s-token&quot;]

<p dir="auto">To run a <code>connet</code> server, you'll need a TLS certificate. You have a few options to create such certificate:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Recommended</strong> use an <a href="https://acmeclients.com/" rel="nofollow">ACME client</a> to provision one for you. We've had good experiences
running <a href="https://go-acme.github.io/lego/" rel="nofollow">lego</a>.</li>
<li>Buy a TLS certificate from a Certificate Authority like verisign, namecheap, etc.</li>
<li>Use a self-signed TLS certificate, an option most appropriate for testing.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">To create a self-signed certificate, you can use openssl. Alternatively, you can use a tool like
<a href="https://github.com/jsha/minica">minica</a>. When using self-signed certificate, you'll need your clients (and relays)
trusting the server's certificate. Copying the certificate (or CA) public key to the clients and using <code>server-cas</code>
configuration option is the easiest way to achieve this.</p>

As a Sr. Software Engineer &amp; Web-developer primarily working with Python frameworks. I am comfortable wearing many hats, and have worked through small to large sized projects for different sized clients (small to enterprise), building tech both on the Back &amp; Front-end as well as Infra.</p><p>I am currently looking for an AI or LLM company to work with. I have worked with clients in AI since 2022 - and am currently spending several hours per day experimenting with AI &amp; LLMs. From getting my hands dirty with the latest models and papers, to working on small applications that use AI. Especially when it comes to agentive apps (read: function calling or code writing-and-executing models), real world simulations (simulating 1000s of interactions with LLMs) or forecasting with LLMs. I have a few exploratory side-projects to show. And a huge amount of passion for the subject matter (productizing AI &amp; LLMS) to bring to the table. AI-Stack keywords: LangChain, LLamaIndex, AutoML, MLFlow, AG2 (formerly Autogen).</p></div></td></tr>

Hi, I'm Harry Altman!  I was the maintainer of Truffle Debugger (<a href="https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/tree/develop/packages/debugger">https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/tree/develop/package...</a>), a Solidity smart contract debugger, for 5 years.  I eventually ended up writing my own decoding and encoding libraries to support it, as well as a bunch of other things.</p><p>I'm good at this sort of nitpicky work, spotting and thinking about edge cases.  I like getting things <i>exactly</i> right, even though that obviously isn't always possible due to various constraints.  I've been kind of wondering if I should get into embedded development; I find it appealing when things are low-level or similarly constrained.  I've beaten Microcorruption. :)  (The original levels, I haven't played the new ones.)</p><p>I'm also quite interested in unusual or obscure data formats, and working on Truffle Debugger and its associated libraries certainly involved a bunch of having to figure undocumented formats and interfaces. :)  I put down above what languages I've worked substantially in but I'd say I'm a generalist and will figure out whatever you give me (I knew approximately no Javascript, Typescript, or Solidity when I started working at Consensys).</p><p>I'm a mathematician by background and in my spare time, so after the Truffle Debugger project was shut down I took some time off to focus on my mathematical projects.  But now I'm looking for work again!  If you need someone like me, I'm available for hire!</p></div></td></tr>

I've been programming for nearly two decades and have a lot of experience in various technologies. Lately I've been doing some fun stuff with Elixir and Zig related to graphics programming. I love working on weird, unknown projects. My wide range of experience (both with and without computers) helps me figure out tasks that don't have much prior art. I'm also equally thrilled by getting into the nitty gritty of deeply technical things like writing parsers for obscure binary formats.

I've had the opportunity to work as a founding engineer at multiple companies, where I've been involved in building and scaling platforms from scratch. 
At PreFix Inc., I led the backend development of our home maintenance platform, working as the sole backend engineer early on. I played a key role in scaling the customer base, integrating critical systems like Zendesk, Stripe, and HubSpot, and developing our business intelligence platform to enable data-driven decision-making. I also helped expand the engineering team and contributed to major partnerships, including a successful pilot program with a large insurance company, and the many security, privacy and data handling challenges that entails.</p><p>Before that, at Ruckit, I was part of the founding team where we developed a collaborative logistics platform that scaled the company to over $2M in monthly revenue. I managed a distributed team of engineers, drove third-party integrations, and helped position the company for acquisition by Command Alkon.</p><p>Now it's time for something new.  You can checkout my CV/resume linked above for lots more details, and please reach out with any interesting opportunities.</p></div></td></tr>

Hi, my name is Jeremiah. I am looking to join a small startup where I can contribute significantly to a product and work closely in a small team or at a company trying to solve interesting problems.</p><p>I just finished three years of work at a learning startup called Pivot Interactives, which Discovery Education acquired. While working for Pivot Interactives, I was a full-stack web developer implementing features from the design phase to deployment. I created easy-to-use and accessible tools for teachers and students to supplement high-school-level science labs. This included integrations with learning platforms, custom WYSIWYG editor components, auto-grading assignments, and student testing systems.</p><p>Before Pivot Interactives, I was a senior software development engineer at Corning Inc, creating hardware/software that quality controls consumer display glass in factories worldwide. I also wrote tools for scientists to interface with custom-made hardware and commercially available equipment.

Happy to be hands-on if and when needed, but also ready to focus on higher level objectives if that's where I'm most needed and effective.

I am embedded engineer with 14 years of experience with DSPs, microcontrollers and embedded Linux platforms. I can write bare metal firmware from ground up or create Yocto layers for custom board with ARM/RISC-V SoC. I am no stranger to picking up soldering iron, oscilloscope and logic analyzer to quickly find, debug and fix issues on hardware-software boundary. Whether you need a one-off battery and performance optimisations for you ESP32 device, bring-up kernel drivers and features for Raspberry Pi or design a new, multi-sensor LoRa devkit I am happy to help out.</p></div></td></tr>

I'm a seasoned data + AI leader with 10+ years experience building high-performance teams focused on automation, analytics, and data-driven results. I'm the type of person who looks at complex data challenges and sees opportunities for radical transformation. Whether it's automating workflows, experimenting with AI, or creating novel ML models that drive efficiency, I'm all about pushing boundaries and turning data into a growth accelerator.</p><p>I was previously co-founder of a B2B data operations tool, Shipyard. Before that, I was the Head of Data at PMG Digital Agency where I built the team from the ground up. It's most important for me to work for a mission-driven company that wants to scale with bold and innovative approaches. I want to sink my teeth into tough problems and learn new things.</p><p>I'll do my best work focused on a mix of data, AI, and product. I can seamlessly adapt between IC or management roles and I prefer to have a decent amount of time hands on. Smaller organizations with the ability to build something from the ground up is a big plus. Despite my background, I'd like to avoid working in the advertising space.</p></div></td></tr>

Hi, I'm Winston! I'm a backend software engineer and Certified Public Accountant (CPA) with a background in fintech, and I specialize in bridging the gap between financial systems and code.</p><p>Before transitioning into software engineering, I started my career in big 4 public accounting at EY, auditing major financial services firms and consulting on IT systems to ensure SOX compliance for IPO readiness[0]. These experiences taught me how companies waste millions fixing mistakes in their financial systems that could have been avoided with a software engineer who deeply understands accounting.</p><p>In my most recent role, I was the lead developer for the fintech team at a logistics company, where I built a scalable invoicing service that processed thousands of parcels per day. Within six months, I was promoted to lead engineer, managing two junior developers and designing the architecture for the next-generation service.</p><p>My unique blend of technical and accounting expertise enables me to translate complex US GAAP requirements into scalable, compliant software systems, helping growing companies avoid costly errors and stay ahead of their competitors.</p><p>I race cars for fun and have survived multiple accounting busy seasons, so I thrive under pressure. I hold a master's degree and passed all four sections of the CPA exam on my first attempt (8% pass rate), so I also know how to tackle tough challenges.</p><p>No one has ever been fired for hiring a CPA to work on accounting-related problems. Accounting is complicated, and you don't have the time to teach another software engineer 10+ years of formal study and experience. Don't overthink it! Let's talk about how I can improve your company's financial systems and make your life easier to focus on earning more money.</p><p>[0]: <a href="https://www.ey.com/en_us/insights/consulting/why-sox-preparation-can-be-the-key-to-ipo-success" rel="nofollow">https://www.ey.com/en_us/insights/consulting/why-sox-prepara...</a></p></div></td></tr>

I'm a senior full-stack engineer with a good amount of applied AI experience. Eight years ago, I co-founded an AI Math Tutoring company (amy.app). My role was CTO, and we scaled the company to about 25 employees. It was a fully remote company, and we were distributed across all parts of the world.</p><p>Before that, I completed my PhD in HRI (Human-Robot Interaction) at the University of Oxford, in conjunction with the University of Canterbury, where I focused on the persuasive power of voice agents. My favorite working environments are early-stage startups with high growth potential.</p><p>Recently, with the release of the OpenAI real-time API, my interest in VUI (Voice User Interface) was reignited. I really love the VUI paradigm and strongly believe it will be the next big change in the way we communicate with computers.</p><p>Here is a project I built during the winter holiday: <a href="https://www.callgeist.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.callgeist.com</a>. I used almost exclusively Cursor for the UI. The backend uses Twilio + OpenAI real-time.</p><p>Here are a couple of other things I did last year:</p><pre><code>    - https://www.line-items.com is a simple receipt-to-JSON parser. This was written in just one day, but it landed on the front page of HN.
    - https://distill.fyi is LinkedIn on steroids, auto-generating user profiles given a LinkedIn URL. My task was to build a QA system that detects if generated profiles would regress because of prompt changes. I used my know-how from amy.app, where we had a similar problem of undetected "approved" content regression due to prompt changes. 
    - https://www.spaarkd.com is a company that allows you to prompt a garment, which is then produced and delivered to your doorstep. My job was to set up the entire infrastructure, orchestration (payment, shipping, production line), and team.</code></pre></div></td></tr>

Included in this is a massive geospatial data problem, involving data models of variable human movement patterns, constantly evolving physical environment data, and data models tailored for multi-objective optimization.</p><p>Currently employed, with intense side projects, mostly happy with my current job, but always willing to entertain different employers.

I work daily in Python, FastAPI, Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Linux, MacOS, Docker, AWS (EC2, RDS, Elastic Beanstalk, IAM), Git. I'm familiar (Use most months) with ElasticSearch, CloudSearch, Tailwind, Vue. As Hobbies, or smaller projects (used on at least one completed project over the past five years): Go, Zig, C, C++, Rust, Phoenix, NoSQL, MongoDB, (probably more, but these were the ones that came to mind.)</p><p>My day job has me performing two main functions:</p><p>- Building full stack web development systems. I generally lean more towards writing backend code, and documenting our infrastructure. UI is my weakest area. This role has me working in datasets with ~1 billion row tables, and search indexes with ~100 million documents. Since we're a small company (~8 developers), I have been a major part of the architecture of our systems over the past 8 years. We've got five separate core businesses that our dev team supports, and I've been a part of architecting and implementing all of them. I would prefer to focus more on backend development in a future role.</p><p>- Creating one-off scripts or processes to assist in business functions. These tend to involve quickly reverse engineering undocumented web APIs we have permission to use, and querying them for our customers. At their simplest, these are a mix of writing some SQL and a few HTTP requests. At their most complicated, they have involved designing and implementing a tree structure to accurately model the business domain, and then pulling data about these structures from relevant public APIs.</p><p>- Miscellaneous tasks as they come up, recently, I reduced the cost of a company's AWS CloudSearch spend by 80% (over 10k/month) by reviewing their codebase, doing some research, and improving what they were storing and how they were doing so. This required a one-line code change on the existing codebase, and writing a new, short (~500 line) indexer. Doing a deep dive into the single highest AWS line item was the impetus for the project, and frankly, it turned out far better than expected.
Outside of work, I ran <a href="https://www.thiswebsitewillselfdestruct.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.thiswebsitewillselfdestruct.com</a>, a website I built and maintain. It really will self-destruct, and it reaches ~100k users and handles ~13M requests each month. Building tools and infrastructure to manage its moderation and keep it a positive community has been a huge learning experience.</p><p>Email: Femme@Femmeandroid.com</p><p>Good luck with whatever you're working on!</p></div></td></tr>

SEEKING WORK - Data scientist, remote worldwide, email in profile.</p><p>Happy new years! A colleague and I lost out on a large optimization project (network scheduling during cascading failures) with an airline and I'm now looking for work. My ideal is a small/medium company where I can do no BS data science - ML, AI, and OR are my jam.</p><p>I've worked on projects including large language models, knowledge extraction, and the usual ML stuff - failure prediction, translation, maintenance optimization, automated sports highlights, and more. I've also done some more interesting work including vehicle route planning in constrained environments.</p><p>I love avant garde problems, and have a pretty unique toolset (LLMs+KB, OR+ML, etc). I've worked with names you know in tech, automotive, and other spaces.</p><p>The perfect fit is a small/medium sized company with a hair on fire green or brownfield problem that needs solving. I'm available immediately, and champing at the bit. Even if you're unsure, get in touch. Email in profile.</p></div></td></tr>
