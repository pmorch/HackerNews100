<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Unless you took the whole weekend off, you must have seen by now that Andres Freund published an amazing discovery on Friday on the Openwall mailing list (<a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/29/4">https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/29/4</a>).<br>
The whole story around this is both fascinating and scary – and I’m sure will be told around numerous time, so in this diary I will put some technical things about the backdoor that I reversed for quite some time (and I have a feeling I could spend 2 more weeks on this).<br>
There is also a nice gist by smx-smx <a href="https://gist.github.com/smx-smx/a6112d54777845d389bd7126d6e9f504">here</a>&nbsp;that gets updated regularly so keep an eye there as well.<br>
The author(s) of the backdoor went a long way to make the backdoor look as innocent as possible. This is also why all the reversing effort is taking such a long(er) time. Let’s take a look at couple of fascinating things in this backdoor.</p>

<p><strong>String comparison</strong></p>

<p>One of the first things a reverse engineer will do is to search for strings in the code they are looking at. If strings are visible, they can usually tell a lot about the target binary. But if we take a look at the library (and for this diary I am using the one originally sent by Andres) we will see practically no visible strings.<br>
The authors decided to obfuscate all strings – in order to do that, they stored strings as a radix tree (also known as prefix tree or trie, more info at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_tree">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_tree</a>). This allows them to store all strings as obfuscated, however now one of the challenges they had was to lookup strings – they implemented a function that checks whether a string exists in the radix tree table, and if it does, it returns back the offset:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://isc.sans.edu/diaryimages/images/xz1.png"><br>
The image above shows start of the function (originally called Lsimple_coder_update_0) where I also expanded one of the radix tree tables (_Llzip_decode_1). So as input we send a string, and if it exists in the radix tree, we get back its offset. The code needs to do this for every single string lookup, but that should not cause the delay as radix tree lookups are quite fast.</p>

<p><strong>Anti-debugging</strong></p>

<p>Anti-debugging efforts were implemented on several levels. The simplest one includes code where the backdoor is checking if a function starts with the ‘endbr64’ instruction. Let’s check how this works – first the snippet below shows how the .Llzma_block_buffer_encode.0 function gets called. Notice the value 0x0E230 being passed in rdx:</p>

<div><p><img alt="" src="https://isc.sans.edu/diaryimages/images/xz2.png"></p><p>

The following figure shows how the backdoor checks whether the ‘endbr64’ instruction is still there (if not – it has been probably changed by a debugger which signals the backdoor to abort):</p></div>

<p><img alt="" src="https://isc.sans.edu/diaryimages/images/xz3.png"></p>

<p>Another important register here is rdi, which will points to the location of the ‘endbr64’ instruction. In other words, if everything is OK, value of [rdi] must be 0xFA1E0FF3, which is the opcode for the ‘endbr64’ instruction.<br>
So now when we go through code, the line add eax, [rdi] should sum 0xFA1E0FF3 and 0x5E2E230 which results in 0xF223. If that is correct 1 is returned, otherwise 0 (indicating that the 'endbr64' instruction was not there). Quite cool.<br>
There is more another function that dynamically modifies code, but that is horrible for reversing – perhaps later ?</p>

<p><strong>Collecting usernames and IP addresses?</strong></p>

<p>The final function we’ll take a look at is also interesting – it will parse every log created by the sshd service and will try to extract valid usernames and IP addresses. The function is .Llzma12_mode_map.part.1 and we can see the initial comparisons (with my comments) here:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://isc.sans.edu/diaryimages/images/xz4.png"></p>

<p>So with this, the attacker is parsing a log line such as the following:</p>

<p><span>Accepted password for root from 192.168.14.1 port 62405 ssh2</span></p>

<p>Further below in the function we can see that they match on the ‘from’ and ‘ssh2’ keywords and extract what’s between them:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://isc.sans.edu/diaryimages/images/xz5.png"></p>

<p>Finally, they pass this to another function, however that’s not visible in static analysis so this is where I lost it.</p>

<p>Guess that’s it for today – depending on developments we might update this diary but in any case check the resources posted at the beginning as they get updated quite often.<br>
If you are looking at this too - hope you're having fun. I quite enjoyed this (too bad it's back to dayjob soon heh), but I'm also scared about how *<strong>close</strong>* this was to infect zillion servers.</p>

<p>The Federal Communications Commission voted 3–2 to impose net neutrality rules today, restoring the common-carrier regulatory framework enforced during the Obama era and then abandoned while Trump was president.</p>
<p>The rules prohibit Internet service providers from blocking and throttling lawful content and ban paid prioritization. Cable and telecom companies plan to fight the rules in court, but they <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/06/net-neutrality-and-title-ii-win-in-court-as-isps-lose-case-against-fcc/">lost a similar battle</a> during the Obama era when judges upheld the FCC's ability to regulate ISPs as common carriers under Title II of the Communications Act.</p>
<p>"Consumers have made clear to us they do not want their broadband provider cutting sweetheart deals, with fast lanes for some services and slow lanes for others," FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel said at today's meeting. "They do not want their providers engaging in blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization. And if they have problems, they expect the nation's expert authority on communications to be able to respond. Because we put national net neutrality rules back on the books, we fix that today."</p>
<p>ISPs insist the rules aren't necessary because they already follow net neutrality principles yet also claim the rules are so burdensome that they will be prevented from investing more in their networks. Lobby group USTelecom today <a href="https://www.ustelecom.org/ustelecom-statement-on-the-fcc-title-ii-vote/">said</a> the "relentless regulation" comes at the cost of "failing to achieve Internet for all."</p>
<p>"This is a nonissue for broadband consumers, who have enjoyed an open Internet for decades," USTelecom CEO Jonathan Spalter said. "Rather than pushing this harmful regulatory land grab, policymakers should keep their eyes on the real-world prize of building opportunity for everyone in a hyperconnected world."                                            </p>
                                                        
<h2>NCTA: Net neutrality is “net fatality”</h2>
<p>Cable lobby group NCTA-The Internet &amp; Television Association <a href="https://www.ncta.com/media/media-room/statement-of-michael-powell-president-ceo-of-ncta-the-internet-television-association-regarding-the-fccs-unnecessary-and-unlawful-broadband-regulation-order">claimed</a> that "the FCC's marketplace intrusion comes at the worst possible time for our massive national effort to finally close the digital divide—just as billions in federal funding are dedicated to extending internet access to America's unserved communities."</p>
<p>That is a reference to a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/06/us-allocates-42b-in-broadband-funding-find-out-how-much-your-state-will-get/">$42 billion program</a> that is paying ISPs to deploy networks in unserved and underserved areas. "Instead of clearing obstacles to speed broadband deployment where it is most needed, this ill-timed and unlawful order threatens to hinder progress," NCTA CEO Michael Powell said. "This will not deliver net neutrality; it will risk a net fatality."</p>
<p>The court battle against the FCC will center on whether the commission can define broadband as a telecommunications service, a necessary step for imposing Title II common-carrier regulations. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/10/is-net-neutrality-doomed-at-supreme-court-fcc-and-isps-prepare-for-epic-battle/">ISPs hope</a> that the Supreme Court's evolving approach to "major questions" will prevent the FCC from defining broadband as telecommunications without explicit instructions from Congress.</p>
<p>FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks, a Democrat, said that "major questions review is reserved for only 'extraordinary cases'—and this one doesn't come close. There's no 'unheralded power' that we're purporting to discover in the annals of an old, dusty statute—we've been classifying communications services one way or the other for decades, and the 1996 [Telecommunications] Act expressly codified our ability to continue that practice."</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>IBM is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/ibm-buy-hashicorp-64-billion-deal-expand-cloud-software-2024-04-24/">buying HashiCorp for $6.4 <em>billion</em></a>.</p>

<p>That's four months after <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/hashicorp-adopts-business-source-license">HashiCorp rugpulled their <em>entire</em> development community</a> and ditched open source for the 'Business Source License.'</p>

<p>As <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40135490">someone on Hacker News</a> pointed out so eloquently:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>IBM is like a juicer that takes all the delicious flavor out of a fruit</p>
</blockquote>

<p>skywhopper replied:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"HashiCorp already did a great job pre-draining all their flavor."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jgunnink/status/1783303926042996928">Some people wonder</a> if HashiCorp's decision to drop open source was <em>because</em> they wanted to juice the books for a higher price. I mean, <em>six billion dollars?</em> And they're not even a pointless AI company!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This blog post is a transcript of the video I posted today, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNcBk6cwim8">Corporate Open Source is Dead</a>. You can watch it on YouTube.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://redis.io/blog/redis-adopts-dual-source-available-licensing/">Redis dropped the open BSD license</a> and invented their own 'Source Available' license.</p>

<p>And last year, I covered how <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2023/im-done-red-hat-enterprise-linux">Red Hat found a way to just <em>barely</em> comply</a> with the open source GPL license for their Enterprise Linux distro.</p>

<p>Other companies like MongoDB, Cockroach Labs, Confluent, Elasticsearch, and Sentry <a href="https://thenewstack.io/hashicorp-abandons-open-source-for-business-source-license/">also went 'Source Available'</a>. It started with some of the smaller players, but as rot sets in at even the biggest 'open source' companies, open source devs are choosing the nuclear option.</p>

<p>When a company rug pulls? Fork 'em. Literally!</p>

<p>Terraform, HashiCorp's bread and butter, was <a href="https://opentofu.org/blog/the-opentofu-fork-is-now-available/">forked into OpenTofu</a>, and adopted by the Linux Foundation. Companies who built their businesses on top of Terraform quickly switched over. Even juicier, OpenBao—a fork of HashiCorp's other big project Vault—is <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchitoperations/news/366563095/IBM-engineers-hatch-Linux-Foundation-HashiCorp-Vault-fork">backed by IBM</a>! What's going to happen with <em>that</em> fork now?</p>

<p>At least forks seem pretty straightforward in Hashi-land. In the wake of Redis' wanton destruction, it seems like there's a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/04/redis-license-change-and-forking-are-a-mess-that-everybody-can-feel-bad-about/">new fork every week</a>!</p>

<p>And some developers are even exploring ditching the Redis code entirely, like <a href="https://github.com/nalgeon/redka">redka</a>'s an API-compatible wrapper on top of SQLite!</p>

<p>After Red Hat closed its door—most of the way, at least they didn't try pulling a switcheroo on the license itself! Oracle, SUSE, and CIQ <a href="https://www.suse.com/news/OpenELA-for-a-Collaborative-and-Open-Future/">scrapped together the OpenELA alliance</a> to maintain forks of Enterprise Linux. And CentOS users who'll be left in a lurch as June marks the end of CentOS 7 support have to decide whether to use AlmaLinux or one of the ELA projects now.</p>

<p>All these moves shattered the playbook startups and megacorps used—and now we're seeing, abused—to build up billions in revenue over the past decade.</p>

<p>It was all in the name of 'open source'.</p>

<p>As free money dries up and profits slow, companies <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/12/ibm-tells-employees-of-job-cuts-in-marketing-and-communications.html">slash headcount</a> almost as fast as community trust.</p>

<h2>2024 is the year corporate open source died</h2>

<p>2024 is the year Corporate Open Source—or at least any remaining illusions about it—finally died.</p>

<p>It's one thing to build a product with a proprietary codebase, and charge for licenses. You can still build communities around that model, and it's worked for decades.</p>

<p>But it's totally different when you build your product under an open source license, foster a community of users who then build their own businesses on top of that software, then yoink the license when your revenue is affected.</p>

<p>That's called a bait-and-switch.</p>

<p>Brian Cantrill's been sounding the alarm for years—yes, <em>that Brian Cantrill</em>, the one who posted this gem:</p>

<div>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tDacjrSCeq4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
</div>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zRN7XLCRhc">Brian's presentation</a> from 12 years ago is worth a watch, and the bottom line is summed up by <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2023/07/04/Dont-sign-a-CLA-2.html">Drew DeVault</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Contributor License Agreements are] a strategy employed by commercial companies with one purpose only: to place a rug under the project, so that they can pull at the first sign of a bad quarter. This strategy exists to subvert the open source social contract.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By working on a project with a CLA, where you sign away your code, you're giving carte blanche for the company to take away your freedom to use their software.</p>

<p>From a company's perspective, if they want CLAs or if they want to use an anti-open-source license, they do <em>not</em> care about your freedoms. They're protecting revenue streams. They'll often talk about freeloaders, whether it's Amazon building a competing hosted solution, or some startup that found a way to monetize support.</p>

<p>But in the end, even if you have GPL code and you charge people to get it, it's not truly free as in freedom, if the company restricts how you can use, modify, and share the code.</p>

<p>But there's a distinction here, and I know a few people watching this are already yelling at me. There's "free" software, and there's "open source."</p>

<p>People in the free software community <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html">correctly identified the danger</a> of calling free software 'open source.'</p>

<p>I don't think we have to be so dogmatic about it, but there <em>is</em> a fundamental <em>philosophical</em> difference between the free software community, with organizations like the Free Software Foundation and Software Freedom Conservancy behind it, and the more business-oriented 'open source' culture.</p>

<p>Open source culture relies on trust. Trust that companies <em>you and I helped build</em> (even without being on the payroll) wouldn't rugpull.</p>

<p>But time and time again, that trust is shattered.</p>

<p>Is this slow death of corporate open source <em>bad</em>? Well, it's certainly been annoying, especially for devs like me who felt connected to these communities in the past. But it's not <em>all</em> bad.</p>

<h2>Why it's not bad for corporate open source to die</h2>

<p>In fact, this could be a huge opportunity; what happened to the spunky startups like Ansible, HashiCorp, Elasticsearch, or Redis? They were lighting their industries on fire with great new software.</p>

<p>What happened to building up communities of developers, crossing cultural and economic barriers to make software that changed the world?</p>

<p>There are still projects doing that, but so many succumb to enterprise money, where eye-watering amounts of revenue puts profit over philosophy.</p>

<p>But as money dries up, as more developers get laid off after the insane hiring trends of the past five years, maybe small dev teams can move the needle.</p>

<p>The AI bubble hasn't popped yet, so some great people are getting sucked into that vortex.</p>

<p>But someone else could be on the cusp of the next great open source project. Just... don't add a CLA, okay?</p>

<p>And it's not just devs; big companies can join in. Historically bad players like Microsoft and <em>maybe even Oracle</em>—man, it pains me to say that. They've even made strides in the past decade!</p>

<p>IBM could even mend some wounds, like they could reunite OpenTofu and Terraform. There's precedent, like when <a href="https://thenewstack.io/io-js-and-node-js-have-united-and-thats-a-good-thing/">IO.js merged back into Node.js</a> after a fork in 2015.</p>

<p>People asked what Red Hat could do to get me interested in Enterprise Linux again. It's simple: stop treating people who don't bring revenue to the table like garbage. Freeloaders are part of open source—whether they're running homelab or a competing business.</p>

<p>Companies who want to befriend open source devs need to show they care about more than just money. Unfortunately, the trend right now is to rugpull to juice the quarterlies, because money line always goes up!</p>

<p>But you know what? I'd just prefer honesty. If revenue is so dependent on selling software, just... make the software proprietary. Don't be so coy!</p>

<p>But to anyone who's not a multi-billion dollar corporation, don't be a victim of the next rugpull. The warning signs are clear: Don't sign a CLA. Stay away from projects that require them.</p>

<p>Stick to open source licenses that respect your freedom, not licenses written to juice revenue and prep a company for a billion-dollar-buyout.</p>

<p>Maybe it's time for a new open source rebellion. Maybe this time, money <em>won't</em> change company culture as new projects arise from the ash heap. Maybe not, but at least we can try.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">The game of 2048, showing off recursion and complex application logic. Use the arrow keys to move the numbers around the 4x4 grid. The same numbers combine into their sum when moved into each other. Once the 2048 tile is reached, you win the game, though you can keep playing on until you lose. You lose the game when the board is full and you can't make any more moves.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Overflow</h3><a id="user-content-overflow" aria-label="Permalink: Overflow" href="#overflow"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">A program that deliberately causes a stack overflow via infinite recursion to perform a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine_escape" rel="nofollow">virtual machine escape</a>. It leverages the fact that there are no runtime checks to prevent a stack overflow. No other modern platform will let you do this :-)</p>
<p dir="auto">Upon running, the program will constantly print the stack pointer to the screen. Once this displayed value exceeds 2048, the stack will have reached the end of its intended memory space and spill onto the heap memory space, causing the print statement to malfunction in explosive fashion:</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/ArhanChaudhary/NAND/blob/main/media/overflow.png"><img src="https://github.com/ArhanChaudhary/NAND/raw/main/media/overflow.png" width="700"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Two things of noteworthy interest are worth pointing out.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you reload the page and run this program on an empty RAM (a RAM full of zeroes), you will notice that the program resets itself halfway through its execution despite not pressing the "Reset" button. Why this happens is simple: the jailbroken runtime executes an instruction that sets the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_counter" rel="nofollow">program counter</a>'s value to 0, effectively telling the program to jump to the first instruction and start over.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you run the GeneticAlgorithm example program and then run this immediately afterwards, the program in its rampage reads old RAM memory that was simply never overwritten.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/ArhanChaudhary/NAND/blob/main/media/old_memory.png"><img src="https://github.com/ArhanChaudhary/NAND/raw/main/media/old_memory.png" width="700"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">SecretPassword</h3><a id="user-content-secretpassword" aria-label="Permalink: SecretPassword" href="#secretpassword"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">A program that exploits the fact that the runtime doesn't prevent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_buffer_overflow" rel="nofollow">stack smashing</a> to call a function that would otherwise be inaccessible. In order to understand how this works, let's examine this illustration of NAND's stack frame layout.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/ArhanChaudhary/NAND/blob/main/media/stack_layout.png"><img src="https://github.com/ArhanChaudhary/NAND/raw/main/media/stack_layout.png" width="700"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><em>taken from the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Computing-Systems-second-Principles-dp-0262539802/dp/0262539802/ref=dp_ob_title_bk" rel="nofollow">Nand to Tetris book</a>.</em></p>
<p dir="auto">If you're unfamiliar with stack layouts, here's the main idea behind the exploit. Whenever a function returns, it needs to know where (which machine code instruction memory address) it should go to proceed with execution flow. So, when the function is first called, this memory address, along with some other unimportant data, is temporarily stored on the stack in a memory region referred to as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack#STACK-FRAME" rel="nofollow">stack frame</a> as a reference for where to return. The illustration describes the exact position of this return address relative to the function call, a position that can be reverse engineered.</p>
<p dir="auto">The program enables the user to overwrite a single memory address in the RAM to any value. Putting two and two together, if the user were to overwrite the return address of a stack frame with the address of another function, they essentially gain the ability to execute arbitrary code included in the program.</p>
<p dir="auto">Indeed, if you enter 267 as the memory location and 1715 as the value to overwrite, two numbers reverse engineered by manually inspecting the stack memory space and the assembler, you'll see this idea in working action.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/ArhanChaudhary/NAND/blob/main/media/secret_password.png"><img src="https://github.com/ArhanChaudhary/NAND/raw/main/media/secret_password.png" width="700"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This isn't a vulnerability unique to NAND. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow" rel="nofollow">It exists in C as well</a>! How cool!</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">GeneticAlgorithm</h3><a id="user-content-geneticalgorithm" aria-label="Permalink: GeneticAlgorithm" href="#geneticalgorithm"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Believe it or not, out of the many, <em>many</em> different components of NAND, this single-handedly took the longest to develop!</p>
<p dir="auto">This program is a creature simulation that utilizes simple machine learning. It follows the artificial intelligence coded series (parts <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnwjxityDLQ" rel="nofollow">one</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOZfhUcNiqk" rel="nofollow">two</a>) from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CodeBullet" rel="nofollow">Code Bullet</a>.

<p dir="auto">Simply explained:</p>
<p dir="auto">Every dot has its own "brain" of acceleration vectors, and they evolve to reach a goal through natural selection. Every generation, dots that "die" closer to the goal are more likely to be selected as the parents for the next generation. Reproduction inherently causes some of the brain to mutate, wholly effectively simulating natural evolution.</p>
<p dir="auto">Nevertheless, there is much to be desired. Due to performance, the only factor dots use to evolve is their closeness to the goal upon death, endowing the natural selection algorithm with low entropy. Due to memory usage, there are smaller than satisfactory limits on the number of dots and the sizes of their brains. Lastly, due to technical complexity, re-placing obstacles during the simulation does not guarantee that the dots will have large enough brains to reach the goal. Brain sizes are only determined at the beginning of the program.</p>
<p dir="auto">I've utilized a myriad of optimization techniques to snake around the following hardware restrictions and make this possible:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>NAND has a limited ROM memory space, meaning the program won't compile if there's too much code. In fact, the final version of this program uses 99.2% of the instruction memory space.</li>
<li>NAND has a limited RAM memory space, meaning the program has to be careful to optimize heap memory usage. In fact, the reason why the screen fills with static between generations is to use the screen memory space as temporary swap memory for the next generation — the RAM is already completely full!</li>
<li>NAND has no floating point type (decimal numbers) and can only represent the integers between -32768 and 32767, making calculating fitness less precise and more challenging to implement. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_overflow" rel="nofollow">Integer overflows</a> must also be accounted for.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">To avoid beating around the bush, I've stuck to documenting these techniques and additional insights in this program's <a href="https://github.com/ArhanChaudhary/NAND/blob/main/src/example-programs/GeneticAlgorithm">codebase</a> for those interested.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Before we start, the most important detail to remember about writing programs in Jack is that there is no operator priority; this is probably why your program isn't working.</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">For example, you should change: <br>
<code>4 * 2 + 3</code> to <code>(4 * 2) + 3</code> <br>
<code>if (~x &amp; y)</code> to <code>if ((~x) &amp; y)</code></p>
<p dir="auto">but you can keep <code>if (y &amp; ~x)</code> the same as there is no operator ambiguity.</p>
<p dir="auto">Without parenthesis, the evaluation value of an ambiguous expression is <strong>undefined</strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Jack Introduction</h3><a id="user-content-jack-introduction" aria-label="Permalink: Jack Introduction" href="#jack-introduction"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">NAND boasts its own complete tech stack. As a consequence, NAND can only be programmed in Jack, its weakly typed object-oriented programming language. In layman's terms, Jack is C with Java's syntax.</p>
<p dir="auto">Let's take the approach of example-based learning and dive right in.</p>

<p dir="auto">If you've already had some experience with programming, this should look very familiar; it is clear that Jack was heavily inspired by Java. <code>Main.main</code> is the entry point to the program. The code segment demonstrates basic usage of variables as well as the while loop for control flow.</p>
<p dir="auto">Additionally, it uses <code>Keyboard.readLine</code> and <code>Keyboard.readInt</code> to read input from the user, and <code>Output.printString</code> and <code>Output.println</code> to print output to the screen — all of which are defined in detail in the <a href="#jack-os">Jack OS Reference</a>.

<p dir="auto">We define a <code>Point</code> class to represent an abstract point in space. It uses <code>field</code> variables to declare per-instance attributes of the data type. It exposes public <code>method</code> functions we can use to interface with the point, giving the caller the functionality to add two points together and calculate the distance between two points.</p>
<p dir="auto">All <code>field</code> variables are privately scoped. If you wish to get or set these variables from outside the class declaration, these variables must have corresponding <code>method</code> functions to provide this functionality.</p>
<p dir="auto">Omitted from the code sample to stay on-topic, it is customary for data classes to define <code>dispose</code> methods for deallocation once objects are no longer needed. See <a href="#manual-memory-management">Manual Memory Management</a>.</p>

<p dir="auto">Remember how we said Jack was similar to Java? That was a facade, or at best misleading. While Java is strongly-typed and as such supports complex type features such as down casting, polymorphism, and inheritance, Jack supports none of these and only has one type under the hood: the signed 16-bit integer. This is the primary reason why Jack is so weakly-typed. In effect, the compiler won't care if you mix and match different types in assignments and operations.</p>

<p dir="auto">You may be startled to notice that after a few seconds, the program will crash with "ERR6", or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_overflow" rel="nofollow">heap overflow</a>!</p>
<p dir="auto">Jack is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_memory_management" rel="nofollow">manually memory managed</a> programming language. This means you must be vigilant to properly deallocate memory that is no longer needed, or else the Jack OS will think otherwise and facilitate a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_leak" rel="nofollow">memory leak</a>. The best practice advice is to feature a <code>dispose</code> method for each class that represents an object that properly encapsulates this deallocation. Thus, when objects are no longer needed, you can call their <code>dispose</code> methods to ensure you won't eventually run out of heap memory.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you've programmed in other manually memory managed languages, like C, this should look very familiar. One key difference is the Jack OS stores arrays and strings on the heap rather than on the stack, hinting to why the program crashes with a heap overflow.</p>

<p dir="auto">What does <code>20000 &gt; -20000</code> evaluate to? The virtual machine transpiles this to <code>20000 - (-20000) &gt; 0</code> which evaluates to <code>-25336 &gt; 0</code>. Unfortunately, the answer is <code>false</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">However, <code>20000 &gt; -10000</code> evaluates to <code>30000 &gt; 0</code>, or <code>true</code>.</p>

<p dir="auto"><code>Output.printInt</code> internally expects <code>Math.abs</code> to return a positive number. This isn't the case with -32768, so the Jack OS malfunctions.</p>
<p dir="auto">Your main concern should be handling logic errors with the negative operator. As the programmer, if you want to guarantee the negative of a negative number is positive, it is your responsibility to check for the case of -32768 and take appropriate action.</p>
<p dir="auto"><span id="user-content-note-1">*</span> This holds true because NAND's ALU internally processes the Jack expression <code>-x</code> as  <code>~(x - 1)</code>. Let's set <code>x</code> to <code>-32768</code> and evaluate it step by step. Here are the corresponding 16-bit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement" rel="nofollow">two's complement</a> binary representations of the computation:</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>x</code> = <code>1000 0000 0000 0000</code> <br>
<code>x - 1</code> = <code>0111 1111 1111 1111</code> <br>
<code>~(x - 1)</code> = <code>1000 0000 0000 0000</code> = <code>x</code></p>
<p dir="auto">It's the same thing! What happened here? Because NAND is a 16-bit machine, -32768 is the only number such that if you subtract one from it, you get its flipped bits. In other words, -32768 satisfies <code>x - 1 = ~x</code>, simplifying the expression to <code>~(~x)</code> or just <code>x</code>.</p>

<p dir="auto">Since its rise in the 1970s, there's a good reason why 16-bit computing has fallen from grace in the modern era. Compared to 32-bit or 64-bit computing, 16-bit computing offered limited processing power and memory capacity that simply weren't meeting the demands of contemporary software and applications.</p>
<p dir="auto">NAND is no exception to this reality.</p>

<p dir="auto">Compared to your 16 GiB MacBook, NAND enjoys a meager 4 KiB of RAM, a ratio of <em>0.00002%</em>! In spite of this, <a href="https://www.metroweekly.com/2014/07/to-the-moon-and-back-on-4kb-of-memory/" rel="nofollow">it was enough to take us to the moon</a>, so who's to say NAND can't either.</p>
<p dir="auto">The Jack OS reserves 14,336 memory addresses of the 4 KiB for the heap, a number that is abnormally small. This is why it's so important to ensure complex Jack applications allocate and deallocate their memory efficiently. If you're overly ambitious, you might run out of heap memory and be forced to completely rewrite your data types and logic.</p>
<p dir="auto">The hardware reserves 8,192 memory addresses of the 4 KiB for the screen. Each bit of each address linearly maps to a corresponding pixel on the provided 512x256 screen, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_numbering#LSb_0_bit_numbering" rel="nofollow">LSb 0 bit numbering</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">The hardware reserves memory address 24,576 for the keyboard, at which the currently pressed key is reflected. Though, you shouldn't directly access this location to handle user input. You should use the provided <a href="#keyboard">Keyboard</a> class from the Jack OS and its associated functions.</p>
<p dir="auto">NAND's keyboard recognizes all ASCII characters, as well as the following keys.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>new line = 128 = <code>String.newline()</code></li>
<li>backspace = 129 = <code>String.backspace()</code></li>
<li>left arrow = 130</li>
<li>up arrow = 131</li>
<li>right arrow = 132</li>
<li>down arrow = 133</li>
<li>home = 134</li>
<li>end = 135</li>
<li>page up = 136</li>
<li>page down = 137</li>
<li>insert = 138</li>
<li>delete = 139</li>
<li>ESC = 140</li>
<li>F1 - F12 = 141 - 152</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Lastly, the hardware reserves 240 memory addresses for static class variables and 1,792 memory addresses for the global stack. Unless you perform deep recursion, you probably won't find these limitations troublesome.</p>

<p dir="auto">The NAND computer follows the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_architecture" rel="nofollow">Harvard architecture</a>. That is, the instruction memory (ROM) and the data memory (RAM) are separately stored, brought to function in unison by the CPU.</p>

<p dir="auto">NAND's CPU is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accumulator_(computing)#Accumulator_machines" rel="nofollow">accumulator machine</a>, meaning that it is heavily dependent on its built-in registers for control flow (in this case the accumulator is the D register). Don't worry if you don't fully understand what the CPU visualization depicts. Instead, take the perspective of appreciation for how this elegantly simple design powers the entirety of NAND — in your web browser!</p>

<p dir="auto">We've reached the instruction set, the nitty-gritty. As indicated, NAND's CPU only has <em>two</em> opcodes! This makes the instruction set relatively simple while providing a rich functionality. NAND's ALU is additionally specified with the expressions it can compute in a single instruction.</p>
<p dir="auto">Phew! That was a lot to take in, but I promise you NAND is far less complicated than I've made it out to be. From a relatively simple logical foundation, Turing equivalence is achieved!

<p dir="auto">Let's briefly talk about the compiler and the virtual machine to make this section feel complete. These concepts are nothing unique to NAND, hence their brevity. Some of NAND's strange syntactical features are a direct consequence of making the compiler easier to implement. The compiler is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_descent_parser" rel="nofollow">recursive descent parser</a> on an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LL_parser" rel="nofollow">LL(1) grammar</a>, generating virtual machine code to be utilized as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_machine" rel="nofollow">simple stack machine</a> (a technique that also handles managing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack" rel="nofollow">call stacks</a>).

          <i>String</i> constants are enclosed within quotation marks and may contain any characters except new lines or quotation marks. Unlike typical programming languages, these characters cannot be escaped within a string, so these characters are instead supplied by the functions <code>String.newLine()</code> and <code>String.doubleQuote()</code> from the OS. <sub><sup>If you manage to read this, say <a href="https://files.bithole.dev/nandy.png" rel="nofollow">hi</a> to Nandy</sup></sub></p><p>

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Whoa, is <em>everything</em> made from NAND gates?</h3><a id="user-content-whoa-is-everything-made-from-nand-gates" aria-label="Permalink: Whoa, is everything made from NAND gates?" href="#whoa-is-everything-made-from-nand-gates"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Well..., I admit the description and title are a little misleading, but still in good faith. The compiler and virtual machine translator are written in Typescript, while the kernel and hardware are emulated in Rust. Just the logic simulator runs computations and memory accesses from NAND gates. Bootstrapping the full tech stack is a feat that isn't unheard of, but such a massive project by itself probably deserves its own separate project.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Did you design NAND by yourself?</h3><a id="user-content-did-you-design-nand-by-yourself" aria-label="Permalink: Did you design NAND by yourself?" href="#did-you-design-nand-by-yourself"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">NAND follows the <a href="https://www.nand2tetris.org/" rel="nofollow">Nand to Tetris course</a> and its <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Computing-Systems-second-Principles-dp-0262539802/dp/0262539802/ref=dp_ob_title_bk" rel="nofollow">associated book</a> (you should definitely check it out, it's an absolutely incredible read). I solely implemented the specification for CPU, assembler, virtual machine translator, and compiler, while porting the platform to the web with its own IDE and user interface.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">If there's only one type, what is the point of specifying types at all?</h3><a id="user-content-if-theres-only-one-type-what-is-the-point-of-specifying-types-at-all" aria-label="Permalink: If there's only one type, what is the point of specifying types at all?" href="#if-theres-only-one-type-what-is-the-point-of-specifying-types-at-all"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This question references the fact that under the hood, the signed 16-bit integer is Jack's only real type. We anyways need to be so explicit with types to help the compiler figure out which class certain instance methods belong to. If we declare the Jack variable <code>s</code> with the type <code>String</code>, <code>s.appendChar(33)</code> is transformed during compilation into <code>String.appendChar(s, 33)</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why does the IDE feel finnicky?</h3><a id="user-content-why-does-the-ide-feel-finnicky" aria-label="Permalink: Why does the IDE feel finnicky?" href="#why-does-the-ide-feel-finnicky"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">NAND's IDE unfortunately trades implementation simplicity for a worse user experience. It uses the unorthodox <a href="https://medium.engineering/why-contenteditable-is-terrible-122d8a40e480" rel="nofollow">contenteditable</a> and hacky cursor positioning logic to get syntax highlighting to work. I myself was surprised that I managed to even bring it to a functional state. As a result, it's slow and noticeably buggy, plus common keybinds don't work. I'm sorry, but for now you'll just need to bear with me.</p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">You now know how to program NAND in Jack! And wow! It's been grand voyage of discovery. This write-up only begins to do justice the pure genius behind the computer architecture of the modern world. Hopefully, you gain a newfound appreciation for the Herculean amount of technical complexity it takes to bridge the gap between your code and program output on the screen.</p>
<p dir="auto">Press "Start" to compile and run your code. The OS will typically take a little under a second to initialize memory and set up its services before you're off to see your program running!</p>
<p dir="auto">If you've read this far, my heartfelt thank you! Happy coding!</p>

We take care of the annoyances of external APIs (167 and counting) so you can quickly build custom integrations for your SaaS, while retaining full control over how they work.
2 min demo video: <a href="https://www.loom.com/share/d04c67b47e284e86b91b4b99fba548ec" rel="nofollow">https://www.loom.com/share/d04c67b47e284e86b91b4b99fba548ec</a></p><p>SaaS engineering teams face a tough choice: they can build each integration in-house from scratch, which gives them full control but takes a lot of time and maintenance effort. Or they can use pre-built solutions, which are fast and easy but less flexible and might not fulfill all customer needs.</p><p>Nango combines the best of both worlds. We let you quickly ship custom integrations without building complex infrastructure or diving deep into the quirks of each API. You control the business logic, data models, and customer-specific configurations, like custom field mappings. We handle (O)Auth and run your integrations reliably in production.</p><p>Under the hood, your integrations run as typescript “lambdas” on Nango. A typical integration has 3-5 lambdas of 20-50 lines of code each. These lambdas live inside your git repo, are version-controlled with the rest of your app, and get deployed to Nango with a CLI (<a href="https://docs.nango.dev/understand/core-concepts">https://docs.nango.dev/understand/core-concepts</a>).</p><p>Our runtime has a built-in scheduler for continuous background syncs, monitoring to know if your integrations run as expected, detailed logging of everything that happens in Nango, and pre-built infrastructure to deal with (O)auth, retries, rate-limit handling, webhook floods, data caching, de-duplication, etc. More here: <a href="https://docs.nango.dev/understand/architecture">https://docs.nango.dev/understand/architecture</a></p><p>We have found that ChatGPT and Copilot let you build integrations on Nango very fast without having to learn each API’s intricacies. LLMs are great at figuring out which endpoint to use, what parameters it takes, etc. Paired with our runtime, this lets you build complex, high-scale integrations in hours instead of weeks.</p><p>We’ve put a ton of effort into dealing with API complexities, so you don’t have to. Even integrations that looked simple at first ended up forcing us to extend our infra to deal with their quirks and gotchas.</p><p>For example, we had to figure out 100+ different OAuth implementations (see <a href="https://www.nango.dev/blog/why-is-oauth-still-hard">https://www.nango.dev/blog/why-is-oauth-still-hard</a> and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35713518">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35713518</a>). We had to deal with a half-dozen non-standard auth methods (Github apps, Stripe apps, Netsuite, etc.), expiring webhooks, ways to deal with data dependencies, weird pagination methods, API keys that change with every API call, dozens of different ways to register for webhooks, etc. It’s a constantly moving target, but it is a challenge we have come to love, and we think the approach makes sense: we specialize in finicky details that vary from API to API—you specialize in making your product great and offering more integrations to your users.</p><p>Last but not least, Nango is open source (<a href="https://github.com/NangoHQ/nango">https://github.com/NangoHQ/nango</a>) under the ELv2 license (allows most use cases, except for direct copy-cats). Anybody can contribute new APIs &amp; share their integration templates with the community.</p><p>The fastest way to see Nango in action is with our interactive demo here (no signup required): <a href="https://app.nango.dev/hn-demo">https://app.nango.dev/hn-demo</a></p><p>Or take a look at our docs: <a href="https://docs.nango.dev/">https://docs.nango.dev</a></p><p>We would love to hear your feedback and look forward to the comments!</p></div></td></tr>        <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><form action="comment" method="post"></form></td></tr>  </tbody></table>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Baltimore County Police arrested<b> </b>Pikesville High School’s former athletic director Thursday morning and charged him with using artificial intelligence to impersonate Principal Eric Eiswert, leading the public to believe Eiswert made <a href="https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com/education/k-12-schools/pikesville-high-principal-eric-eiswert-NT7K7N4K6RDEJNL5Z7ULTEG7VY/" target="_blank">racist and antisemitic comments</a> behind closed doors.</p><p>Dazhon Darien, 31, was charged with disrupting school activities, after investigators determined Darien faked Eiswert’s voice and circulated the audio on social media in January, according to the Baltimore County State’s Attorney’s Office.<b> </b>Darien’s nickname, DJ, was among the names mentioned in the audio clips he allegedly faked.</p><p>“The audio clip ... had profound repercussions,” police wrote in charging documents. “It not only led to Eiswert’s temporary removal from the school but also triggered a wave of hate-filled messages on social media and numerous calls to the school. The recording also caused significant disruptions for the PHS staff and students.”</p><p>He is also charged with theft and retaliating against a witness, related to alleged illicit payments he made to a school athletics coach, as well as stalking, prosecutors said.</p><p>Baltimore County Police Chief Robert McCullough, County Executive Johnny Olszewski, and School Superintendent Myriam Rogers announced a 1:30 pm press conference to discuss the case.</p><p>Eiswert’s voice, which police and <a href="https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com/education/k-12-schools/eric-eiswert-ai-deepfake-YUNO6ITYM5FWZPQAE24RIBV5CQ/" target="_blank">AI experts believe was simulated</a>, made disparaging comments toward Black students and the surrounding Jewish community, was widely circulated on social media.</p><div id="blueconic--fallback"><p><h3>Read More</h3></p></div><p>Questions about the audio’s authenticity quickly followed. Police wrote in charging documents that Darien had accessed the school’s network on multiple occasions in December and January searching for OpenAI tools, and used “Large Language Models” that practice “deep learning, which involves pulling in vast amounts of data from various sources on the internet, can recognize text inputted by the user, and produce conversational results.” They also connected Darien to an email account that had distributed the recording.</p><p>Many current and former students <a href="https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com/education/k-12-schools/pikesville-high-principal-eric-eiswert-recording-ai-DZ6ZURS3Y5F7HEQMMGBH244Y3E/" target="_blank">believed Eiswert was responsible</a> for the offensive remarks, while former colleagues denounced the audio and defended Eiswert’s character. Eiswert himself has denied making those comments and said the comments do not align with his views.</p><p>The audio, posted to the popular Instagram account<b> </b><a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C2NEEDrMo8_/?igsh=MTYwZWE4MnpxdDFvbA%3D%3D" target="_blank">murder_ink_bmore</a>, prompted a Baltimore County Public Schools and Baltimore County Police investigation. Eiswert has not been working in the school since the investigation began.</p><p>The voice refers to “ungrateful Black kids who can’t test their way out of a paper bag” and questions how hard it is to get those students to meet grade-level expectations. The speaker<b> </b>uses names of people who appear to be staff members and says they should not have been hired, and that<b> </b>he should get rid of another person “one way or another.”</p><p>“And if I have to get one more complaint from one more Jew in this community, I’m going to join the other side,” the voice said.</p><p>Darien was being investigated as of December in a theft investigation that had been initiated by Eiswert. Police say Darien had authorized a $1,916 payment to the school’s junior varsity basketball coach, who was also his roommate, under the pretense that he was an assistant girls soccer coach. He was not, school officials said. Eiswert determined that Darien had submitted the payment to the school payroll system, bypassing proper procedures. Darien had been notified of the investigation, police said.</p><p>Police say the clip was received by three teachers the night before it went viral. The first was Darien; a third said she received the email and then got a call from Darien and teacher Shaena Ravenell telling her to check her email. Ravenell told police that she had forwarded the email to a student’s cell phone, “who she knew would rapidly spread the message around various social media outlets and throughout the school,” and also sent it to the media and the NAACP, police said.</p><p>She did not mention receiving it from Darien until confronted about his involvement. Ravenell has not been charged with a crime and could not immediately be reached for comment.</p><p>Rogers, the superintendent, in January called the comments “disturbing” and “highly offensive and inappropriate statements about African American students, Pikesville High School staff, and Pikesville’s Jewish community.”</p><p>Billy Burke, head of the Council of Administrative &amp; Supervisory Employee, the union that represents Eiswert, was the only official to suggest the audio was AI-generated.</p><p>Burke said he was disappointed in the public’s assumption of Eiswert’s guilt. At a January school board meeting, he said the principal needed police presence at his home because he and his family have been harassed and threatened. Burke had also received harassing emails, he said at the time.</p><p>Police said the school’s front desk staff was “inundated with phone calls from parents and students expressing concern and disparaging remarks toward school staff and administrators.” The flood of calls made it difficult to field phone calls from parents trying to make arrangements for their children and other school functions, officials told police.</p><p>“The school leadership expressed that staff did not feel safe, which required an increase in police presence at the school to address safety concerns and fears,” police said.</p><p>Teachers, under the impression the recording was authentic, “expressed fears that recording devices could have been planted in various places in the school,” police said.</p><p>“The recording’s release deeply affected the trust between teachers and the administration,” police said. “One individual shared that they fielded sensitive phone calls in their vehicle in the parking lot instead of speaking in school.”</p><p>Experts in detecting audio and video fakes told The Banner in March that there was <a href="https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com/education/k-12-schools/eric-eiswert-ai-deepfake-YUNO6ITYM5FWZPQAE24RIBV5CQ/" target="_blank">overwhelming evidence</a> the voice is AI-generated. They noted its flat tone, unusually clean background sounds and lack of consistent breathing sounds or pauses as hallmarks of AI. They also ran the audio through several different AI-detection techniques, which consistently concluded it was a fake, though they could not be 100% sure.</p><p>AI voice-generation tools are now widely available online, and a single minute’s recording of someone’s voice can be enough to simulate it with a $5-a-month AI tool, the <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2024/02/with-elections-looming-worldwide-heres-how-to-identify-and-investigate-ai-audio-deepfakes/" target="_blank">Nieman Journalism Lab reported</a> in February.</p><p>There are few regulations to prevent AI imitations, called deepfakes, and few perpetrators are prosecuted.</p><div id="article_eoa_container"><p><h3>More From The Banner</h3></p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<p>“Gadgets aren’t fun anymore,” sighed my wife, watching me tap away on my Palm Zire 72 as she sat on the couch with her MacBook Air, an iPhone, and an Apple Watch.</p>
<p>And it’s true: The smartphone has all but eliminated entire classes of gadgets, from point-and-shoot cameras to MP3 players, GPS maps, and even flashlights. But arguably no style of gadget has been so thoroughly superseded as the personal digital assistant, the handheld computer that dominated the late '90s and early 2000s. The PDA even set the template for <i>how</i> its smartphone successors would render it obsolete, moving from simple personal information management to encompass games, messaging, music, and photos.</p>
<p>But just as smartphones would do, PDAs offered a dizzying array of operating systems and applications, and a great many of them ran Palm OS. (I bought my first Palm, an m505, new in 2001, upgrading from an HP 95LX.) Naturally, there’s no way we could enumerate every single such device in this article. So in this Ars retrospective, we’ll look back at some notable examples of the technical evolution of the Palm operating system and the devices that ran it—and how they paved the way for what we use now.</p>

<h2>When Zoom(er) wasn’t meeting software</h2>
<p>In the mid-to-late 1980s, portable computing primarily meant either heavy, luggable workstations or a unique class of pocket computers with tiny screens, small memories, and calculator-like keyboards. Jeff Hawkins, then vice president of research at portable systems builder GRiD, thought he could do better. He wanted to build a system where the screen itself becomes the input device, replacing keyboards with pens and styluses.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>While handwriting recognition was an even bigger challenge for systems back then, Hawkins’ PalmPrint system simplified the task by merely matching strokes to characters instead of trying to recognize entire words. PalmPrint became GridPen, the core of the 1989 GriDPad 1900, or what we would call today the first commercially successful tablet computer. Using a resistive 10-inch black-and-white LCD as the screen and writing surface, it ran MS-DOS on a lower-power 10 MHz Intel 80C86 and weighed just about two kilograms (4.5 pounds), selling at an MSRP of $2,500 (about $6,200 in 2024 dollars).</p>
<p>The GriDPad line went on to be very successful for GRiD, but Hawkins increasingly considered his own creation to be too bulky and expensive. Surveying existing GriDPad corporate customers about a portable machine they would <i>personally</i> use, the feedback was unanimous: It had to be a lot lighter, a lot smaller, and under a cool grand.</p>
<p>GRiD itself wasn’t interested in producing a low-end mass-market device, but such a unit was well within the market range of Tandy Corporation, GRiD’s parent since 1988 and the owners of Radio Shack. Tandy management was entranced by the concept of what Hawkins called the “Zoomer,” so much so that the company was willing to invest $300,000 in Hawkins’ new venture to develop it, which he called Palm Computing.</p>
<p>Hawkins selected GeoWorks’ PC/GEOS as the operating system based on <a href="https://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2023/06/o-brother-geobook-lets-get-thou-back-on.html">its proven ability</a> to run on inexpensive hardware, and Tandy brought on longtime partner Casio (also a major pocket computer manufacturer) as the new device’s OEM. To manage the growing company, Hawkins hired Apple-Claris alumnus Donna Dubinsky as CEO and later Ed Colligan as VP of marketing, fresh from Macintosh peripherals maker Radius.</p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/palmfeature3-scaled.jpg" data-height="2560" data-width="1928" alt="The Tandy Zoomer, here in the Casio Z-7000 OEM version."><img alt="The Tandy Zoomer, here in the Casio Z-7000 OEM version." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/palmfeature3-640x850.jpg" width="640" height="850" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/palmfeature3-1280x1700.jpg 2x"></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/palmfeature3-scaled.jpg" data-height="2560" data-width="1928">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> The Tandy Zoomer, here in the Casio Z-7000 OEM version.</p><p>Cameron Kaiser</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, the Zoomer’s development became increasingly troubled due to corporate interference and software churn, and although underclocking its x86-compatible CPU to 7 MHz dramatically extended its battery life, it also made the unit slow and ponderous. Still, the Zoomer got to market in October 1993 at a pound in weight (less than half a kilogram) and for $599 ($1,240 in 2024), markedly undercutting Apple’s Newton MessagePad. On the other hand, it was still too large and was basically treated (and judged) as a PC, and even though its handwriting recognition was better than the Newton’s, it was still outsold four to one.</p>

<p>Tribler is a Bittorrent-compatible alternative to Youtube.
It is designed to protect your privacy, build a web-of-trust, be attack-resilient, and
reward content creators directly.
We are building a micro-economy without banks, without advertisers,
and without any government.
Together <a href="http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2007/08/creating-a-computer-currency/" rel="nofollow">with Harvard University</a>, the Tribler team deployed one of the first
fully distributed ledgers in August 2007, see <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6971904.stm" rel="nofollow">BBC News coverge</a> and a <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn12565-bandwidth-could-be-a-new-global-currency.html" rel="nofollow">New Scientist article</a>.
In coming years we will further expand our micro-economy based on <em>bandwidth tokens</em>.
We aim to become the key place where audiences find their torrents, creative talents
get discovered, and artists get financial rewards from their fans.
Tribler is the place where 100 percent of the money goes to artists and the people that run the infrastructure.</p>
<p>Our mission: <em>re-inventing media and money</em>.</p>
<p>Over 2 million people have used Tribler over the years.
The Tribler project was started in 2005 at Delft University of Technology
and over 100+ developers contributed code to it.
We are continuously improving it and further expanding the scientific developers team.</p>
<p>Technical foundations of Tribler are the Bittorrent protocol,
an overlay for P2P communication across NAT/firewalls,
gradual building of trust in public keys with Bittorrent seeding,
and our token economy with incentives for Tor-like relaying and hidden seeding.
For 12 years we have been building a very robust self-organising Peer-to-Peer system.
Today Tribler is robust: "the only way to take Tribler down is to take The Internet down" (but a single software bug could end everything).</p>

<p><h2>Aim: solving trust</h2><a id="user-content-aim-solving-trust" aria-label="Permalink: Aim: solving trust" href="#aim-solving-trust"></a></p>
<p>Social media today is obsessed with profit, filled with advertisements,
overflowing with falsehoods, and infested with fake news.
We're trying to fix these hard problems in a unique way: by building trust.
Our audacious ambition is a clean-slate re-creation of The Internet itself with
foundations of trust.
Craiglist and eBay showed us in 1995 that trustworthy trade was possible online.
Uber, Etsy, and AirBnB show that entire industries can be disrupted by
a single platform with a natural monopoly.</p>
<p>For the past 18 years we have build and deployed platforms to create trust.
Before Wikipedia and Youtube existed we studied the mechanisms behind trust and user-generated content on a small scale.
Several years before Wikipedia emerged we <a href="https://static.usenix.org/events/usenix2000/freenix/full_papers/pouwelse/pouwelse.pdf" rel="nofollow">deployed a music encyclopedia with unconstrained write access</a>, it never became popular because we focused too much on software, instead community growth.</p>
<p>Today we keep a narrow focus and continuously expand Tribler with trustworthy
decentralized technology. We launched sub-second keyword search for
Bittorrent swarms without any server back in 2010 (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXWMhreGiAU" rel="nofollow">our old Google Tech Talk</a> on this topic). One of our operational trust browsing prototypes:

<p><h2>Tribler features and innovations</h2><a id="user-content-tribler-features-and-innovations" aria-label="Permalink: Tribler features and innovations" href="#tribler-features-and-innovations"></a></p>
<p>Tribler supports torrent search without websites, anonymous downloading, torrent streaming, channels of torrents, and sharing content for tokens. <a href="http://sigmm.org/records/records1201/featured03.html" rel="nofollow">Overview of Tribler (.html 5 pages)</a>.
All Tribler features are implemented in a completely distributed manner, not relying on any centralized component.
Still, Tribler manages to remain fully backwards compatible with BitTorrent. <a href="http://iptps06.cs.ucsb.edu/papers/Pouw-Tribler06.pdf" rel="nofollow">The 2006 overview of Tribler (.pdf 6 pages)</a> featuring taste groups, friends, friends-of-friends and faster downloads by donating bandwidth to friends (<a href="http://svn.tribler.org/bt2-design/coop-download/trunk/note.tex" rel="nofollow">protocol spec</a> of friend boosting).
Note that <a href="http://svn.tribler.org/bt2-design/proto-spec-unified/trunk/proto-spec-current.pdf" rel="nofollow">the 2006-2009 Tribler protocol specification (.pdf 47 pages)</a> is now mostly outdated, as we switched to our new synchronization protocol called Dispersy (see below).</p>
<p>Trust in social media content is essential for a sustainable ecosystem.
We introduced channels of Bittorrent swarms <a href="https://www.tribler.org/LivePlaylists/" rel="nofollow">in 2009</a> with the Tribler 4.x release.
Each user can vote on channels to increase their visibility and tell everybody the
channel owner is not a spammer and not spreading fake items.
The reputation of both the voters and channel owner are important.</p>
<p>Tribler protects your privacy by not storing anything on any server.
To protect your privacy even more, we have prototyped search algorithms
based on homomorphic cryptography.
We presented a <a href="https://github.com/Tribler/tribler/files/1649968/privacy_overlay.pdf">new algorithm system for privacy-respecting
scalable Gnutella-like search</a> in 2014.
Our approach to scalability is a similarity function in the encrypted domain (homomorphic), enabling semantic clustering with privacy.</p>
<p>Back in 2006 we introduced long-lived identities to separate trustworthy peers from
freeriders and spammers (<a href="https://www.tribler.org/PermID/" rel="nofollow">PermID</a>). To protect your
privacy further we also devised an alternative to onion routing which potentially
could have stronger security guarantees (correlation attack).

<p><h2>Our primitive 2007 distributed ledger and Trustchain (2012)</h2><a id="user-content-our-primitive-2007-distributed-ledger-and-trustchain-2012" aria-label="Permalink: Our primitive 2007 distributed ledger and Trustchain (2012)" href="#our-primitive-2007-distributed-ledger-and-trustchain-2012"></a></p>
<p>We deployed one of the worlds first fully distributed ledgers in August of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6971904.stm" rel="nofollow">2007</a>.
For over a decade we meticulously measured, analysed, improved, and enhanced this live system.
Today it defines the state-of-the-art in blockchain research, but in the early days it barely functioned at all.
A total of five Ph.D. students of Delft contributed key parts and upgrades.</p>
<p>At launch we called our initiative "<em>bandwidth-as-a-currency</em>". Today we have specific terminology for what we did: a token economy.
We are making Internet bandwidth a tradable commodity without any middleman or need for any centralised governance.
Our efforts span over a decade, making us the veterans in the field.
Our ledger provides an incentive for Bittorrent seeding and Tor-like relaying.
For numerous years the tit-for-tat algorithm provided the only incentive for contributions in Bittorrent.
No incentive for seeding existed, except when central servers kept track of your uploads and downloads.
We measured closed invite-only communities for numerous years and mathematically showed their rich-get-richer properties. For details see <a href="http://publicatio.bibl.u-szeged.hu/2509/1/SRE-p2p11-final-version.pdf" rel="nofollow">Fast download but eternal seeding: the reward and punishment of sharing ratio enforcement</a> and our measurement paper <a href="http://www.usenix.org/event/iptps10/tech/full_papers/Meulpolder.pdf" rel="nofollow">understanding bandwidth economics and ratio enforcement (.pdf 5 pages)</a>.
We measured 508,269 peers in 444 swarms within five BitTorrent communities, ranging from public to highly elite. We observe download performance, connectability, seeder/leecher ratios, seeding duration, and statistics regarding the resource supply.</p>
<p>We got inspiration for a novel blockchain design based on operating our own ledger and studying token economies.
Our current work is called Trustchain, a unique design from 2012 where all participants have their own personal blockchain and create their own genesis block.
Our older work used a graph-based approach and graph-based reputation algorithms.
Trustchain records transactions in a tamper-proof and scalable manner.
It does not require mining and does not try to solve the double spending problem.
Our primitive 2007 ledger pre-dates Bitcoin, additionally our 2012 DAG-based approach pre-dates IOTA and the Texas DAG patents.</p>
<p>We are fans of Bitcoin, but also showed in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141218123940/http://www.pds.ewi.tudelft.nl/~victor/bitcoin.html" rel="nofollow">an early analysis</a> the flaws in this concept.
Our approach to digital signatures is the essential difference which sets us apart from others.
Mono-signatures form the foundation of all other projects we have seen in the past decade.
Meaning, in systems such as Bitcoin a transaction is already valid with a single signature.
Our Trustchain design does not permit transactions with merely a single signature.
Trustchain only supports multi-party agreement recording, others are not valid.
We believe that we created a more powerful system by removing single-signature transactions.
Only time can tell the usefullness of this academically-pure and minimal design.</p>
<p>The foundation of our approach is making repeated successful interactions between actors explicit and durable.
Cryptographically signed records of successful encounters serve as proof-of-work certificates.
The validity and value of these certificates is determined by a trust and reputation system.
Relaying for anonymity and seeding in Tribler constitutes work which is rewarded with a signed certificate.
Helping others and uploading in Bittorrent swarms is rewarded with bandwidth tokens (e.g. signed certificates).
Mining in our system becomes download parts of a swarm and uploading them to multiple interested parties.
In 2013 we got the credit mining part of our system operational in early Beta.
The screenshot below from November 2013 shows the boosting of various swarms.
Note the investment yields of "struck gold" and "poor" in the right column.</p>

<p><h2>Our methodology: keep focus and dream big</h2><a id="user-content-our-methodology-keep-focus-and-dream-big" aria-label="Permalink: Our methodology: keep focus and dream big" href="#our-methodology-keep-focus-and-dream-big"></a></p>
<p>For our narrow focus of a Bittorrent client we are exploring the fundamentals of
identity, trust, and trade. With over 1 billion users of Youtube and Bittorrent we know there
is a mass audience ready for something better.</p>
<p>Our approach has very boring foundations, when compared to newer and more sexy work, like IPFS, FileCoin, or Storj.
We first measured Bittorrent in 2002, it is a flourishing mature ecosystem and ready for an upgrade.
Bootstrapping an ecosystem is hard, we designed and deployed a superior alternative to Bittorrent.
It became an official <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7574/" rel="nofollow">IETF Internet Standard</a>, but completely flopped.
This formed our preference for simplicity, elegance and our allergy for bloatware, clean-slate work, and over-engineering.
Numerous other projects try to create a generic approach using an ICO for funding and
promising the early adopters a dazzling return-on-investment.
Tribler is different. <em>rant warning</em>. We are non-profit academics.
We do not want to replace the old elite with a new crypto-currency elite.
What is changed if we replace backroom deals, lobbyists, middleman, and legal monopolies with the tools of the new elite:
algorithms, early investor rewards, proof-of-dominating-stake, and smart contracts?
Replacing the analog world and breading digital-native inequality does not make the world a better place.
We are creating a micro-economy based on fairness, trust, equality, and self-governance.
By design we banish rent-seeking. Critical infrastructure rarely makes profit. We are trying to build critical infrastructure.</p>
<p><h2>Tor-inspired onion routing</h2><a id="user-content-tor-inspired-onion-routing" aria-label="Permalink: Tor-inspired onion routing" href="#tor-inspired-onion-routing"></a></p>
<p>As of December 2014 Tribler has a build-in version of a Tor-like anonymity system. This is completely disconnected from 'The' Tor network. It is still ongoing work. It gives you probably superior protection than a VPN, but no protection against resourceful spying agencies.</p>
<p>We have implemented the <a href="https://github.com/Tribler/tribler/blob/v6.3.1/Tribler/community/tunnel/community.py#L271">main parts of the Tor wire protocol within Tribler</a>.
Instead of the TCP protocol that 'the' Tor network uses, we use UDP.
The enables us to do NAT puncturing and traversal.
We have created our own network using this Tor variant, our code is not compatible with normal Tor.
Work started as a <a href="https://github.com/Tribler/tribler/issues/119">small trial</a> in December 2013 with anonymous Bittorrent downloading.
Essential part of our work is that everybody who downloads anonymously also becomes a relay.
This brings the Bittorrent tit-for-tat idea to darknets.
With this ongoing work we aim to offer in 2018 with Tribler V7.0 proxied downloading for any Bittorrent swarm.</p>
<p><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/399d6eeb8c0a4d7b34ae8df87f56f11ca97ed253280754a1608cdacdac4777b3/68747470733a2f2f662e636c6f75642e6769746875622e636f6d2f6173736574732f313536343235372f313730353337342f65653265623265612d363064632d313165332d383937372d3138313138353431366136332e706e67" alt="December 2013 trial with TOR-like onion routing for anonymous swarm downloading" data-canonical-src="https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1564257/1705374/ee2eb2ea-60dc-11e3-8977-181185416a63.png"></p>
<p>Lengthy documentation in the form of two master thesis documents is available. First is a general documentation of the tunnel and relay mechanism, <a href="http://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3A997890d1-4141-4597-92eb-3dbaa4dc44a1?collection=education" rel="nofollow">Anonymous HD video streaming, .pdf 68 pages</a>.
Second is focused on encryption part, called <a href="http://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3Ace3bd867-6540-426d-87d0-348bdf78279d?collection=education" rel="nofollow">Anonymous Internet: Anonymizing peer-to-peer traffic using applied cryptography, .pdf 85 pages</a>.
In addition, there are the specifications for the protocols
for <a href="https://github.com/Tribler/tribler/wiki/Anonymous-Downloading-and-Streaming-specifications">anonymous downloading</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Tribler/tribler/wiki/Hidden-Services-Specifications-for-anonymous-seeding">hidden seeding</a> on this wiki.</p>
<p><h2>overlay protocol for synchronization</h2><a id="user-content-overlay-protocol-for-synchronization" aria-label="Permalink: overlay protocol for synchronization" href="#overlay-protocol-for-synchronization"></a></p>
<p>The current foundation of Tribler is the Dispersy overlay. Dispersy functionality includes: making connections, sending messages, puncturing NAT boxes, and distributed database synchronization. Every 5 seconds Dispersy sends out a message to establish a new connection or re-connect to a known peer.
Note that <a href="https://github.com/qstokkink/py-ipv8">we are transitioning to a new overlay</a> for the durations of 2018.</p>
<p>Overlay communication, peer discovery and content discovery (keyword search) are essential building blocks of a peer-to-peer system. Tribler preserves the content and peers it discovered in the past. Every Tribler client runs a full SQL database engine. Several times per second each Tribler peer sends and receives updates for this database. Our protocol for distributed database synchronization is called Dispersy.
See a simple messaging client written with just a few lines of code as <a href="https://github.com/jarradh/DispersyExample">a simple tutorial example</a>; <a href="https://github.com/Tribler/dispersy/blob/devel/doc/tutorial-part1.org">outdated broken tutorial</a>.</p>

Key features of Dispersy are stateless synchronization using Bloomfilters, decentralized NAT traversal, and data bundle selection algorithms that allow the system to scale over 100,000 bundles in the presence of high churn and high-load scenario's.</p>
<p>Dispersy uses a simple database schema, with the <em>sync</em> table containing the data bundles to synchronise across peers in the <em>packet</em> field.

<p><h2>Stealth app for Android</h2><a id="user-content-stealth-app-for-android" aria-label="Permalink: Stealth app for Android" href="#stealth-app-for-android"></a></p>
<p>The following work is ongoing. We have an <a href="https://github.com/AlexKolpa/AndroidStealth/issues?state=open">operational Android app</a> that can spread itself via NFC. The app can spread viral via friends, even if it is blocked from a central app store.</p>
<p>Original student assignment: <em>The aim is to create an Open Source Android smartphone app to help bypass restrictions by non-democratic governments.  The Arab Spring showed the importance of video recording of mass protests. However, possession of a video recording on your phone of human rights violations and mass uprisings brings grave danger. The idea is to make this app “check-point-proof”, meaning that a somewhat knowledgeable person will not detect the presence of the app and will not discover any video content. The app itself should be hidden, you can make a “stealth” app by somehow removing the app icon from your app list (sadly it simply still shows up in the uninstall app list). The app is activated simply by “dialing” a secret telephone number or other method your deem secure. Starting point for your work can be found here: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5921071/how-to-create-a-stealth-like-android-app" rel="nofollow">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5921071/how-to-create-a-stealth-like-android-app</a>.
Your Stealth app need to be able to virally spread and be able to bypass an government restrictions on the official app store. Include the feature for NFC and direct-wifi transfer of the .apk with an easy on-screen manual and steps. Thus users can pass your app along to their friends.</em></p>

<p>Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks work on the presumption that all nodes in the network are connectable. However, NAT boxes and firewalls prevent connections to many nodes on the Internet.
We created a method to puncture NATs which does not require a server. Our method is therefore a simple no-server-needed alternative to the complex STUN, TURN and <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5245" rel="nofollow">ICE</a> approaches.
<a href="https://dl.ifip.org/db/conf/networking/networking2011-2/HalkesP11.pdf" rel="nofollow">We conducted one of the largest measurements of NAT/Firewall behavior and puncture efficiency in the wild</a>. Our method is a UDP hole-punching technique. We measured the success rate using volunteers running Tribler. Number of users in our trials are 907 and 1531 people. Our results show that UDP hole punching is an effective method to increase the connectability of peers on the Internet: approximately 64% of all peers are behind a NAT box or firewall. More than 80% of hole punching attempts between these peers succeed.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="Why One Man Spent 12 Years Fighting Robocalls" data-elid="2667800049" data-post-url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-to-stop-robocalls" data-authors="Michael Koziol" data-page-title="Why One Man Spent 12 Years Fighting Robocalls - IEEE Spectrum"><p>
	At some point, our phone habits changed. It used to be that if the phone rang, you answered it. With the advent of caller ID, you’d only pick up if it was someone you recognized. And now, with spoofing and robocalls, it can seem like a gamble to pick up the phone, period. In 2023, <a href="https://robocallindex.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>robocall blocking service Youmail</u></a> estimates there were <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2024/01/16/americans-received-55-million-robocalls-in-2023-a-9-jump-from-2022/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more than 55 billion robocalls</u></a> in the United States. How did robocalls proliferate so much that now they seem to be dominating phone networks? And <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-your-phone-company-aims-to-stop-robocalls" target="_self"><u>can any of this be undone</u></a>? <em><em><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</a></em></em>spoke with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidfrankel2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>David Frankel of ZipDX</u></a>, who’s been fighting robocalls for over a decade, to find out.
</p><p>David Frankel is<a href="https://www.zipdx.info/about/team-members/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the founder of ZipDX</u></a>, a company that provides audioconferencing solutions. He also created the <a href="https://legalcallsonly.org/what-is-rraptor/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Rraptor</u></a> automated robocall surveillance system.</p><p><strong>How did you get involved in trying to stop robocalls?</strong></p><p><strong>David Frankel: </strong>Twelve years ago, I was working in <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/telecommunications/">telecommunications</a> and a friend of mine called me <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2013/04/ftc-announces-robocall-challenge-winners" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>about a contest</u></a> that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) was starting. They were seeking the public’s help to find solutions to the robocall problem. I spent time and energy putting together a contest entry. I didn’t win, but I became so engrossed in the problem, and like a dog with a bone, I just haven’t let go of it.
</p><p><strong>How can we successfully combat robocalls?</strong></p><p><strong>Frankel: </strong>Well, I don’t know the answer, because I don’t feel like we’ve succeeded yet. I’ve been very involved in something called<a href="https://tracebacks.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>traceback</u></a>—in fact, it was my FTC contest entry. It’s a semiautomated process where, in fact, with the cooperation of individual phone companies, you go from telco A to B to C to D, until you ultimately get somebody that sent that call. And then you can find the customer who paid them to put this call on the network.
</p><p>
	I’ve got a second tool—a <a href="https://legalcallsonly.org/what-is-rraptor/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>robocall surveillance network</u></a>. We’ve got tens of thousands of telephone numbers that just wait for robocalls. We can correlate that with other data and reveal where these calls are coming from. Ideally, we stop them at the source. It’s a sort of sewage that’s being pumped into the telephone network. We want to go upstream to find the source of the sewage and deal with it there.
</p><p><strong>Can </strong><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-robocalls-2667266649" target="_self"><u><strong>more regulation</strong></u></a><strong> help?</strong></p><p><strong>Frankel: </strong>Well, regulations are really, really tough for a couple of reasons. One is, it’s a bureaucratic, slow-moving process. It’s also a cat-and-mouse game, because, as quick as you start talking about new regulations, people start talking about how to circumvent them.
</p><p>
	There’s also this notion of regulatory capture. At the Federal Communications Committee, the loudest voices come from the telecommunications operators. There’s an imbalance in the control that the consumer ultimately has over who gets to invade their telephone versus these other interests.
</p><p><strong>Is the robocall situation getting better or worse?</strong></p><p><strong>Frankel: </strong>It’s been fairly steady state. I’m just disappointed that it’s not substantially reduced from where it’s been. We made progress on explicit fraud calls, but we still have too many of these lead-generation calls. We need to get this whacked down by 80 percent. I always think that we’re on the cusp of doing that, that this year is going to be the year. There are people attacking this from a number of different angles. Everybody says there’s no silver bullet, and I believe that, but I hope that we’re about to crest the hill.
</p><p><strong>Is this a fight that’s ultimately winnable?</strong></p><p><strong>Frankel: </strong>I think we’ll be able to take back our phone network. I’d love to retire, having something to show for our efforts. I don’t think we’ll get it to zero. But I think that we’ll be able to push the genie a long way back into the bottle. The measure of success is that we all won’t be scared to answer our phone. It’ll be a surprise that it’s a robocall—instead of the expectation that it’s a robocall.

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Reduced Motion</h2><a id="user-content-reduced-motion" aria-label="Permalink: Reduced Motion" href="#reduced-motion"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Thank you for joining me in this very important message about motion on your website. See, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-motion" rel="nofollow">not everyone likes it, and some actually prefer no motion</a>. They have <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-motion" rel="nofollow">ways to tell us about it</a> and we should listen. While I don't want to go as far as tell you not to have confetti on your page just yet, I do want to make it easy for you to respect what your users want. There is a <code>disableForReducedMotion</code> option you can use so that users that have trouble with chaotic animations don't need to struggle on your website. This is disabled by default, but I am considering changing that in a future major release. If you have strong feelings about this, <a href="https://github.com/catdad/canvas-confetti/issues/new">please let me know</a>. For now, please confetti responsibly.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">API</h2><a id="user-content-api" aria-label="Permalink: API" href="#api"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">When installed from <code>npm</code>, this library can be required as a client component in your project build. When using the CDN version, it is exposed as a <code>confetti</code> function on <code>window</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><code>confetti([options {Object}])</code> → <code>Promise|null</code></h3><a id="user-content-confettioptions-object--promisenull" aria-label="Permalink: confetti([options {Object}]) → Promise|null" href="#confettioptions-object--promisenull"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><code>confetti</code> takes a single optional object. When <code>window.Promise</code> is available, it will return a Promise to let you know when it is done. When promises are not available (like in IE), it will return <code>null</code>. You can polyfill promises using any of the popular polyfills. You can also provide a promise implementation to <code>confetti</code> through:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const MyPromise = require('some-promise-lib');
const confetti = require('canvas-confetti');
confetti.Promise = MyPromise;"><pre><span>const</span> <span>MyPromise</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'some-promise-lib'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>const</span> <span>confetti</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'canvas-confetti'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>confetti</span><span>.</span><span>Promise</span> <span>=</span> <span>MyPromise</span><span>;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">If you call <code>confetti</code> multiple times before it is done, it will return the same promise every time. Internally, the same canvas element will be reused, continuing the existing animation with the new confetti added. The promise returned by each call to <code>confetti</code> will resolve once all animations are done.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><code>options</code></h4><a id="user-content-options" aria-label="Permalink: options" href="#options"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>confetti</code> parameter is a single optional <code>options</code> object, which has the following properties:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>particleCount</code> <em>Integer (default: 50)</em>: The number of confetti to launch. More is always fun... but be cool, there's a lot of math involved.</li>
<li><code>angle</code> <em>Number (default: 90)</em>: The angle in which to launch the confetti, in degrees. 90 is straight up.</li>
<li><code>spread</code> <em>Number (default: 45)</em>: How far off center the confetti can go, in degrees. 45 means the confetti will launch at the defined <code>angle</code> plus or minus 22.5 degrees.</li>
<li><code>startVelocity</code> <em>Number (default: 45)</em>: How fast the confetti will start going, in pixels.</li>
<li><code>decay</code> <em>Number (default: 0.9)</em>: How quickly the confetti will lose speed. Keep this number between 0 and 1, otherwise the confetti will gain speed. Better yet, just never change it.</li>
<li><code>gravity</code> <em>Number (default: 1)</em>: How quickly the particles are pulled down. 1 is full gravity, 0.5 is half gravity, etc., but there are no limits. You can even make particles go up if you'd like.</li>
<li><code>drift</code> <em>Number (default: 0)</em>: How much to the side the confetti will drift. The default is 0, meaning that they will fall straight down. Use a negative number for left and positive number for right.</li>
<li><code>flat</code> <em>Boolean (default: false)</em>: Optionally turns off the tilt and wobble that three dimensional confetti would have in the real world. Yeah, they look a little sad, but y'all asked for them, so don't blame me.</li>
<li><code>ticks</code> <em>Number (default: 200)</em>: How many times the confetti will move. This is abstract... but play with it if the confetti disappear too quickly for you.</li>
<li><code>origin</code> <em>Object</em>: Where to start firing confetti from. Feel free to launch off-screen if you'd like.
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>origin.x</code> <em>Number (default: 0.5)</em>: The <code>x</code> position on the page, with <code>0</code> being the left edge and <code>1</code> being the right edge.</li>
<li><code>origin.y</code> <em>Number (default: 0.5)</em>: The <code>y</code> position on the page, with <code>0</code> being the top edge and <code>1</code> being the bottom edge.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>colors</code> <em>Array&lt;String&gt;</em>: An array of color strings, in the HEX format... you know, like <code>#bada55</code>.</li>
<li><code>shapes</code> <em>Array&lt;String|Shape&gt;</em>: An array of shapes for the confetti. There are 3 built-in values of <code>square</code>, <code>circle</code>, and <code>star</code>. The default is to use both squares and circles in an even mix. To use a single shape, you can provide just one shape in the array, such as <code>['star']</code>. You can also change the mix by providing a value such as <code>['circle', 'circle', 'square']</code> to use two third circles and one third squares. You can also create your own shapes using the <a href="#confettishapefrompath-path-matrix---shape"><code>confetti.shapeFromPath</code></a> or <a href="#confettishapefromtext-text-scalar-color-fontfamily---shape"><code>confetti.shapeFromText</code></a> helper methods.</li>
<li><code>scalar</code> <em>Number (default: 1)</em>: Scale factor for each confetti particle. Use decimals to make the confetti smaller. Go on, try teeny tiny confetti, they are adorable!</li>
<li><code>zIndex</code> <em>Integer (default: 100)</em>: The confetti should be on top, after all. But if you have a crazy high page, you can set it even higher.</li>
<li><code>disableForReducedMotion</code> <em>Boolean (default: false)</em>: Disables confetti entirely for users that <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-motion" rel="nofollow">prefer reduced motion</a>. The <code>confetti()</code> promise will resolve immediately in this case.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><code>confetti.shapeFromPath({ path, matrix? })</code> → <code>Shape</code></h3><a id="user-content-confettishapefrompath-path-matrix---shape" aria-label="Permalink: confetti.shapeFromPath({ path, matrix? }) → Shape" href="#confettishapefrompath-path-matrix---shape"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This helper method lets you create a custom confetti shape using an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/d" rel="nofollow">SVG Path string</a>. Any valid path should work, though there are a few caveats:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>All paths will be filed. If you were hoping to have a stroke path, that is not implemented.</li>
<li>Paths are limited to a single color, so keep that in mind.</li>
<li>All paths need a valid transform matrix. You can pass one in, or you can leave it out and use this helper to calculate the matrix for you. Do note that calculating the matrix is a bit expensive, so it is best to calculate it once for each path in development and cache that value, so that production confetti remain fast. The matrix is deterministic and will always be the same given the same path value.</li>
<li>For best forward compatibility, it is best to re-generate and re-cache the matrix if you update the <code>canvas-confetti</code> library.</li>
<li>Support for path-based confetti is limited to browsers which support <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Path2D" rel="nofollow"><code>Path2D</code></a>, which should really be all major browser at this point.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">This method will return a <code>Shape</code> -- it's really just a plain object with some properties, but shhh... we'll pretend it's a shape. Pass this <code>Shape</code> object into the <code>shapes</code> array directly.</p>
<p dir="auto">As an example, here's how you might do a triangle confetti:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="var triangle = confetti.shapeFromPath({ path: 'M0 10 L5 0 L10 10z' });

confetti({
  shapes: [triangle]
});"><pre><span>var</span> <span>triangle</span> <span>=</span> <span>confetti</span><span>.</span><span>shapeFromPath</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> <span>path</span>: <span>'M0 10 L5 0 L10 10z'</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>confetti</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>
  <span>shapes</span>: <span>[</span><span>triangle</span><span>]</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><code>confetti.shapeFromText({ text, scalar?, color?, fontFamily? })</code> → <code>Shape</code></h3><a id="user-content-confettishapefromtext-text-scalar-color-fontfamily---shape" aria-label="Permalink: confetti.shapeFromText({ text, scalar?, color?, fontFamily? }) → Shape" href="#confettishapefromtext-text-scalar-color-fontfamily---shape"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This is the highly anticipated feature to render emoji confetti! Use any standard unicode emoji. Or other text, but... maybe don't use other text.</p>
<p dir="auto">While any text should work, there are some caveats:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>For flailing confetti, something that is mostly square works best. That is, a single character, especially an emoji.</li>
<li>Rather than rendering text every time a confetti is drawn, this helper actually rasterizes the text. Therefore, it does not scale well after it is created. If you plan to use the <code>scalar</code> value to scale your confetti, use the same <code>scalar</code> value here when creating the shape. This will make sure the confetti are not blurry.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The options for this method are:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>options</code> <em><code>Object</code></em>:
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>text</code> <em><code>String</code></em>: the text to be rendered as a confetti. If you can't make up your mind, I suggest "🐈".</li>
<li><code>scalar</code> <em><code>Number, optional, default: 1</code></em>: a scale value relative to the default size. It matches the <code>scalar</code> value in the confetti options.</li>
<li><code>color</code> <em><code>String, optional, default: #000000</code></em>: the color used to render the text.</li>
<li><code>fontFamily</code> <em><code>String, optional, default: native emoji</code></em>: the font family name to use when rendering the text. The default follows <a href="https://nolanlawson.com/2022/04/08/the-struggle-of-using-native-emoji-on-the-web/" rel="nofollow">best practices for rendring the native OS emoji of the device</a>, falling back to <code>sans-serif</code>. If using a web font, make sure this <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FontFace/load" rel="nofollow">font is loaded</a> before rendering your confetti.</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto">This method creates an instance of the <code>confetti</code> function that uses a custom canvas. This is useful if you want to limit the area on your page in which confetti appear. By default, this method will not modify the canvas in any way (other than drawing to it).</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>Canvas can be misunderstood a bit though, so let me explain why you might want to let the module modify the canvas just a bit. By default, a <code>canvas</code> is a relatively small image -- somewhere around 300x150, depending on the browser. When you resize it using CSS, this sets the display size of the canvas, but not the image being represented on that canvas. Think of it as loading a 300x150 jpeg image in an <code>img</code> tag and then setting the CSS for that tag to <code>1500x600</code> -- your image will end up stretched and blurry. In the case of a canvas, you need to also set the width and height of the canvas image itself. If you don't want to do that, you can allow <code>confetti</code> to set it for you.</em></p>
<p dir="auto">Note also that you should persist the custom instance and avoid initializing an instance of confetti with the same canvas element more than once.</p>
<p dir="auto">The following global options are available:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>resize</code> <em>Boolean (default: false)</em>: Whether to allow setting the canvas image size, as well as keep it correctly sized if the window changes size (e.g. resizing the window, rotating a mobile device, etc.). By default, the canvas size will not be modified.</li>
<li><code>useWorker</code> <em>Boolean (default: false)</em>: Whether to use an asynchronous web worker to render the confetti animation, whenever possible. This is turned off by default, meaning that the animation will always execute on the main thread. If turned on and the browser supports it, the animation will execute off of the main thread so that it is not blocking any other work your page needs to do. Using this option will also modify the canvas, but more on that directly below -- do read it. If it is not supported by the browser, this value will be ignored.</li>
<li><code>disableForReducedMotion</code> <em>Boolean (default: false)</em>: Disables confetti entirely for users that <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-motion" rel="nofollow">prefer reduced motion</a>. When set to true, use of this confetti instance will always respect a user's request for reduced motion and disable confetti for them.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><em><strong>Important: If you use <code>useWorker: true</code>, I own your canvas now. It's mine now and I can do whatever I want with it (don't worry... I'll just put confetti inside it, I promise). You must not try to use the canvas in any way (other than I guess removing it from the DOM), as it will throw an error. When using workers for rendering, control of the canvas must be transferred to the web worker, preventing any usage of that canvas on the main thread. If you must manipulate the canvas in any way, do not use this option.</strong></em></p>

<p>TSMC announced its leading-edge 1.6nm-class process technology today, a new A16 manufacturing process that will be the company's first Angstrom-class production node and promises to outperform its predecessor, N2P, by a significant margin. The technology's most important innovation will be its backside power delivery network (BSPDN).</p><p>Just like TSMC's 2nm-class nodes (N2, N2P, and N2X), the company's 1.6nm-class fabrication process will rely on gate-all-around (GAA) nanosheet transistors, but unlike the current and next-generation nodes, this one uses backside power delivery dubbed Super Power Rail. Transistor and BSPDN innovations enable tangible performance and efficiency improvements compared to TSMC's N2P: the new node promises an up to 10% higher clock rate at the same voltage and a 15% - 20% lower power consumption at the same frequency and complexity. In addition, the new technology could enable 7% - 10% higher transistor density, depending on the actual design.&nbsp;</p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check=""><div><p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mjEGKugAM7DPXKGJuqdneK-320-80.png.webp 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mjEGKugAM7DPXKGJuqdneK-480-80.png.webp 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mjEGKugAM7DPXKGJuqdneK-650-80.png.webp 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mjEGKugAM7DPXKGJuqdneK-970-80.png.webp 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mjEGKugAM7DPXKGJuqdneK-1024-80.png.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mjEGKugAM7DPXKGJuqdneK-1200-80.png.webp 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)"><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mjEGKugAM7DPXKGJuqdneK-320-80.png" alt="TSMC" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mjEGKugAM7DPXKGJuqdneK-320-80.png 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mjEGKugAM7DPXKGJuqdneK-480-80.png 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mjEGKugAM7DPXKGJuqdneK-650-80.png 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mjEGKugAM7DPXKGJuqdneK-970-80.png 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mjEGKugAM7DPXKGJuqdneK-1024-80.png 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mjEGKugAM7DPXKGJuqdneK-1200-80.png 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" loading="lazy" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mjEGKugAM7DPXKGJuqdneK.png" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mjEGKugAM7DPXKGJuqdneK.png"></picture></p></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description"><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: TSMC)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The most important innovation of TSMC's A16 process, which was unveiled at the company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tsmc.com/static/english/campaign/Symposium2024/index.htm" data-url="https://www.tsmc.com/static/english/campaign/Symposium2024/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">North American Technology Symposium 2024</a>, is the introduction of the Super Power Rail (SPR), a sophisticated backside power delivery network (BSPDN). This technology is tailored specifically for AI and HPC processors that tend to have both complex signal wiring and dense power delivery networks.&nbsp;</p><p>Backside power delivery will be implemented into many upcoming process technologies as it allows for an increase in transistor density and improved power delivery, which affects performance. Meanwhile, there are several ways to implement a BSPDN. TSMC's Super Power Rail plugs the backside power delivery network to each transistor's source and drain using a special contract that also reduces resistance to get the maximum performance and power efficiency possible. From a production perspective, this is one of the most complex BSPDN implementations and is more complex than Intel's Power Via.&nbsp;</p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check=""><div><p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Rdsbs7yUHSe3YNd8mzMn9L-320-80.png.webp 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Rdsbs7yUHSe3YNd8mzMn9L-480-80.png.webp 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Rdsbs7yUHSe3YNd8mzMn9L-650-80.png.webp 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Rdsbs7yUHSe3YNd8mzMn9L-970-80.png.webp 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Rdsbs7yUHSe3YNd8mzMn9L-1024-80.png.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Rdsbs7yUHSe3YNd8mzMn9L-1200-80.png.webp 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)"><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Rdsbs7yUHSe3YNd8mzMn9L-320-80.png" alt="TSMC" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Rdsbs7yUHSe3YNd8mzMn9L-320-80.png 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Rdsbs7yUHSe3YNd8mzMn9L-480-80.png 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Rdsbs7yUHSe3YNd8mzMn9L-650-80.png 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Rdsbs7yUHSe3YNd8mzMn9L-970-80.png 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Rdsbs7yUHSe3YNd8mzMn9L-1024-80.png 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Rdsbs7yUHSe3YNd8mzMn9L-1200-80.png 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" loading="lazy" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Rdsbs7yUHSe3YNd8mzMn9L.png" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Rdsbs7yUHSe3YNd8mzMn9L.png"></picture></p></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description"><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: TSMC)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The choice of backside power rail implementation is perhaps why TSMC decided not to add this feature to its N2P and N2X process technologies, as it would make using the production nodes considerably more expensive.

<p>Engineers have partially restored a 1970s-era computer on NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft after five months of long-distance troubleshooting, building confidence that humanity's first interstellar probe can eventually resume normal operations.</p>
<p>Several dozen scientists and engineers gathered Saturday in a conference room at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, or connected virtually, to wait for a new signal from Voyager 1. The ground team sent a command up to Voyager 1 on Thursday to recode part of the memory of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/02/humanitys-most-distant-space-probe-jeopardized-by-computer-glitch/">spacecraft's Flight Data Subsystem (FDS)</a>, one of the probe's three computers.</p>
<p>“In the minutes leading up to when we were going to see a signal, you could have heard a pin drop in the room," said Linda Spilker, project scientist for NASA's two Voyager spacecraft at JPL. "It was quiet. People were looking very serious. They were looking at their computer screens. Each of the subsystem (engineers) had pages up that they were looking at, to watch as they would be populated."</p>
<h2>Finally, a breakthrough</h2>
<p>Launched nearly 47 years ago, Voyager 1 is flying on an outbound trajectory more than 15 billion miles (24 billion kilometers) from Earth, and it takes 22-and-a-half hours for a radio signal to cover that distance at the speed of light. This means it takes nearly two days for engineers to uplink a command to Voyager 1 and get a response.</p>
<p>In November, Voyager 1 suddenly stopped transmitting its usual stream of data containing information about the spacecraft's health and measurements from its scientific instruments. Instead, the spacecraft's data stream was entirely unintelligible. Because the telemetry was unreadable, experts on the ground could not easily tell what went wrong. They hypothesized the source of the problem might be in the memory bank of the FDS.</p>
<p>There was a breakthrough last month when engineers sent up a novel command to "poke" Voyager 1's FDS to send back a readout of its memory. This readout allowed engineers to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/04/the-diagnosis-is-in-bad-memory-knocked-nasas-aging-voyager-1-offline/">pinpoint the location of the problem in the FDS memory</a>. The FDS is responsible for packaging engineering and scientific data for transmission to Earth.</p>
<p>After a few weeks, NASA was ready to uplink a solution to get the FDS to resume packing engineering data. This data stream includes information on the status of the spacecraft—things like power levels and temperature measurements. This command went up to Voyager 1 through one of NASA's large Deep Space Network antennas Thursday.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Then, the wait for a response. Spilker, who started working on Voyager right out of college in 1977, was in the room when Voyager 1's signal reached Earth Saturday.</p>
<p>"When the time came to get the signal, we could clearly see all of a sudden, boom, we had data, and there were tears and smiles and high fives," she told Ars. "Everyone was very happy and very excited to see that, hey, we're back in communication again with Voyager 1. We're going to see the status of the spacecraft, the health of the spacecraft, for the first time in five months."</p>

<p>Throughout the five months of troubleshooting, Voyager's ground team continued to receive signals indicating the spacecraft was still alive. But until Saturday, they lacked insight into specific details about the status of Voyager 1.</p>
<p>“It’s pretty much just the way we left it," Spilker said. "We're still in the initial phases of analyzing all of the channels and looking at their trends. Some of the temperatures went down a little bit with this period of time that's gone on, but we're pretty much seeing everything we had hoped for. And that's always good news.”</p>
<h2>Relocating code</h2>
<p>Through their investigation, Voyager's ground team discovered a single chip responsible for storing a portion of the FDS memory stopped working, probably due to either a cosmic ray hit or a failure of aging hardware. This affected some of the computer's software code.</p>
<p>"That took out a section of memory," Spilker said. "What they have to do is relocate that code into a different portion of the memory, and then make sure that anything that uses those codes, those subroutines, know to go to the new location of memory, for access and to run it."</p>
<p>Only about 3 percent of the FDS memory was corrupted by the bad chip, so engineers needed to transplant that code into another part of the memory bank. But no single location is large enough to hold the section of code in its entirety, NASA said.</p>
<p>So the Voyager team divided the code into sections for storage in different places in the FDS. This wasn't just a copy-and-paste job. Engineers needed to modify some of the code to make sure it will all work together. "Any references to the location of that code in other parts of the FDS memory needed to be updated as well," NASA said in a statement.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-content">
    <p>Boeing’s white-collar union alleged Tuesday that company management retaliated against engineers overseeing design work on behalf of the Federal Aviation Administration, heightening concerns about a self-regulation regime that’s come under renewed fire since Jan. 5, when a fuselage panel blew out midair.</p><p>In 2022, as Boeing worked to integrate new avionics packages into its 777 and 787 widebody aircraft,  two of its engineers insisted the company needed to reevaluate prior engineering work completed on the two aircraft. The engineering union contends Boeing managers objected to this on the grounds that it would add costs and slow production.</p><p>After the FAA backed the engineers about how the work should be performed and the dispute was settled, in mid-2023 Boeing gave both men negative performance reviews, which cuts pay raises and promotion prospects.</p><p>The two “did the right thing and stuck to their guns despite heavy pressure from Boeing, and then got hit with career-damaging performance reviews,” said Rich Plunkett, the union’s director of strategic development. “This helps show why Boeing doesn’t have a healthy safety culture.”</p><p>The union said one of the engineers quit Boeing over the way he was treated; it’s appealing the performance downgrade to management on behalf of the other.</p><p>Boeing denies the charge of retaliation. </p><p>“After an extensive review of documentation and interviewing more than a dozen witnesses, our investigators found no evidence of retaliation or interference,” spokesperson Bobbie Egan said Tuesday. “We have determined the allegations are unsubstantiated.” </p>
<p>“We have zero tolerance for retaliation and encourage our employees to speak up when they see an issue,” Egan said.</p><p>If proven, the union allegations would undercut Boeing’s recent insistence that it prioritizes safety over cost and schedule considerations and maintains an open culture that protects employees who flag safety issues.</p><p>The&nbsp;union, the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace, SPEEA, has filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board demanding access to the report of the internal Boeing investigation that concluded the negative reviews did not amount to interfering in the oversight work of the two engineers.</p><p>Boeing said it is “looking into the union’s requests” but added that investigations into interference claims are typically confidential.</p><p>“Providing the report to any party outside the FAA would be a departure from our standard practice, ” Boeing said.</p>
<h2>Eyes of the FAA</h2><p>More than 1,000 engineers inside Boeing are authorized to act as the FAA’s eyes in overseeing work. They are legally required to have “a commitment to safety above all other priorities” and so must be independent and free of interference from management concerns about added cost and schedule delays.</p><p>But after the two deadly 737 MAX crashes five years ago, some of these engineers alleged management during the MAX’s development had <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/engineers-say-boeing-pushed-to-limit-safety-testing-in-race-to-certify-planes-including-737-max/">interfered to limit safety testing</a>. </p><p>That coupled with the failure of this internal oversight organization to flag the obvious flaws in <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/times-watchdog/the-inside-story-of-mcas-how-boeings-737-max-system-gained-power-and-lost-safeguards/">the new flight control software that led to the crashes</a> raised serious doubts about Boeing’s ability to certify its own work.</p><p>Congress subsequently began to reverse the yearslong trend of delegating more of the FAA’s safety oversight to Boeing itself. </p><p>After a chain of quality lapses last year and then the fuselage panel blowout on an Alaska Airlines 737 MAX in January, Boeing leadership said it would revamp its safety reporting systems and has repeatedly insisted that all employees can raise safety concerns without fear of retaliation.</p><p>In February, the report of an FAA-appointed panel of independent aviation experts flagged concerns that the employees who represent the FAA fear raising safety issues because Boeing’s internal safety reporting systems fails to ensure “open communication and non-retaliation.”</p>
<p>The findings of that report were <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-workers-still-scared-to-raise-safety-concerns-says-faa-appointed-experts/">highlighted just last week in a hearing before the U.S. Senate Committee</a> on Commerce, Science and Transportation. One finding was that some employees did not receive a raise they had been expecting after bringing up safety concerns.&nbsp;</p><p>After that hearing, Boeing said retaliation is strictly prohibited.&nbsp;</p><p>“Boeing can tell Congress and the media all it wants about how ‘retaliation is strictly prohibited,’” said Plunkett. “But our union is fighting retaliation cases on a regular basis.”</p><h2>Following FAA guidelines</h2><p>The job of the Boeing engineers authorized to work on behalf of the FAA is to check on the work of company engineers as they develop designs and instruct them what must be accomplished to get those designs approved as compliant with regulations.</p>      <p>The union said when overseeing the 777 and 787 avionics integration in 2022, the two engineers insisted the company reevaluate prior engineering calculations, citing an FAA advisory document updated in 2013 that provided guidelines on how to obtain airworthiness approval&nbsp;for such work.</p><p>An FAA advisory typically outlines a standard way of achieving compliance. It’s not mandatory and does not constitute a regulation.</p><p>According to the union, Boeing managers “strongly objected” to the conclusion that the prior work should be redone, “saying that going back to run calculations using the new assumptions would cost money and cause production delays.”</p>
<p>Eventually, after six months of back and forth, the FAA backed the two engineers and Boeing had to redo the analysis. </p><p>Subsequently, however, “when they came up for their next performance reviews, the two engineers received identical negative evaluations,” the union said.</p><p>SPEEA said that when its staff met with Boeing officials on the matter, “the manager of the two engineers admitted that he had rated them both poorly at the request of the 777 and 787 managers who had been forced to resubmit their work.”</p><p>Still, Boeing refused to change the performance evaluations. </p><p>While one of the engineers chose to leave Boeing, the other filed a complaint in the company’s “Speak Up” reporting system alleging retaliation. </p><p>In a meeting with the engineer, accompanied by a SPEEA official, Boeing labor relations personnel told him that his complaint “did not meet the legal threshold of interference, nor the legal definition of retaliation, and as a result, they were closing his case,” the union said.</p>
<p>Because that internal complaint implied interference with an FAA designee, Boeing had to file a report on the incident with the safety agency. As it appeals the performance downgrade, the union now seeks access to that report.</p><p>In 2022, responding to Congress, the FAA introduced new policies to prevent “undue pressure” on the engineers working on its behalf at aviation manufacturers.</p><p>The new regulations require Boeing to monitor for, report and investigate all allegations of interference and to report the results to the FAA. The agency now has the SPEEA charges.</p><p>“The FAA is investigating these allegations,” spokesperson Ian Gregor said Tuesday. </p>

<p dir="auto">If you want to learn how a CPU works all the way from architecture to control signals, there are many resources online to help you.</p>
<p dir="auto">GPUs are not the same.</p>
<p dir="auto">Because the GPU market is so competitive, low-level technical details for all modern architectures remain proprietary.</p>
<p dir="auto">While there are lots of resources to learn about GPU programming, there's almost nothing available to learn about how GPU's work at a hardware level.</p>
<p dir="auto">The best option is to go through open-source GPU implementations like <a href="https://github.com/VerticalResearchGroup/miaow">Miaow</a> and <a href="https://github.com/hughperkins/VeriGPU/tree/main">VeriGPU</a> and try to figure out what's going on. This is challenging since these projects aim at being feature complete and functional, so they're quite complex.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is why I built <code>tiny-gpu</code>!</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">What is tiny-gpu?</h2><a id="user-content-what-is-tiny-gpu" aria-label="Permalink: What is tiny-gpu?" href="#what-is-tiny-gpu"></a></p>
<div dir="auto"><p dir="auto">Important</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>tiny-gpu</strong> is a minimal GPU implementation optimized for learning about how GPUs work from the ground up.</p>
<p dir="auto">Specifically, with the trend toward general-purpose GPUs (GPGPUs) and ML-accelerators like Google's TPU, tiny-gpu focuses on highlighting the general principles of all of these architectures, rather than on the details of graphics-specific hardware.</p>
</div>
<p dir="auto">With this motivation in mind, we can simplify GPUs by cutting out the majority of complexity involved with building a production-grade graphics card, and focus on the core elements that are critical to all of these modern hardwareaccelerators.</p>
<p dir="auto">This project is primarily focused on exploring:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><strong>Architecture</strong> - What does the architecture of a GPU look like? What are the most important elements?</li>
<li><strong>Parallelization</strong> - How is the SIMD progamming model implemented in hardware?</li>
<li><strong>Memory</strong> - How does a GPU work around the constraints of limited memory bandwidth?</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">After understanding the fundamentals laid out in this project, you can checkout the <a href="#advanced-functionality">advanced functionality section</a> to understand some of the most important optimizations made in production grade GPUs (that are more challenging to implement) which improve performance.</p>

</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">GPU</h2><a id="user-content-gpu" aria-label="Permalink: GPU" href="#gpu"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">tiny-gpu is built to execute a single kernel at a time.</p>
<p dir="auto">In order to launch a kernel, we need to do the following:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Load global program memory with the kernel code</li>
<li>Load data memory with the necessary data</li>
<li>Specify the number of threads to launch in the device control register</li>
<li>Launch the kernel by setting the start signal to high.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">The GPU itself consists of the following units:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Device control register</li>
<li>Dispatcher</li>
<li>Variable number of compute cores</li>
<li>Memory controllers for data memory &amp; program memory</li>
<li>Cache</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Device Control Register</h3><a id="user-content-device-control-register" aria-label="Permalink: Device Control Register" href="#device-control-register"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The device control register usually stores metadata specifying how kernels should be executed on the GPU.</p>
<p dir="auto">In this case, the device control register just stores the <code>thread_count</code> - the total number of threads to launch for the active kernel.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Dispatcher</h3><a id="user-content-dispatcher" aria-label="Permalink: Dispatcher" href="#dispatcher"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Once a kernel is launched, the dispatcher is the unit that actually manages the distribution of threads to different compute cores.</p>
<p dir="auto">The dispatcher organizes threads into groups that can be executed in parallel on a single core called <strong>blocks</strong> and sends these blocks off to be processed by available cores.</p>
<p dir="auto">Once all blocks have been processed, the dispatcher reports back that the kernel execution is done.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Memory</h2><a id="user-content-memory" aria-label="Permalink: Memory" href="#memory"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The GPU is built to interface with an external global memory. Here, data memory and program memory are separated out for simplicity.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Global Memory</h3><a id="user-content-global-memory" aria-label="Permalink: Global Memory" href="#global-memory"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">tiny-gpu data memory has the following specifications:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>8 bit addressability (256 total rows of data memory)</li>
<li>8 bit data (stores values of &lt;256 for each row)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">tiny-gpu program memory has the following specifications:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>8 bit addressability (256 rows of program memory)</li>
<li>16 bit data (each instruction is 16 bits as specified by the ISA)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Memory Controllers</h3><a id="user-content-memory-controllers" aria-label="Permalink: Memory Controllers" href="#memory-controllers"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Global memory has fixed read/write bandwidth, but there may be far more incoming requests across all cores to access data from memory than the external memory is actually able to handle.</p>
<p dir="auto">The memory controllers keep track of all the outgoing requests to memory from the compute cores, throttle requests based on actual external memory bandwidth, and relay responses from external memory back to the proper resources.</p>
<p dir="auto">Each memory controller has a fixed number of channels based on the bandwidth of global memory.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Cache (WIP)</h3><a id="user-content-cache-wip" aria-label="Permalink: Cache (WIP)" href="#cache-wip"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The same data is often requested from global memory by multiple cores. Constantly access global memory repeatedly is expensive, and since the data has already been fetched once, it would be more efficient to store it on device in SRAM to be retrieved much quicker on later requests.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is exactly what the cache is used for. Data retrieved from external memory is stored in cache and can be retrieved from there on later requests, freeing up memory bandwidth to be used for new data.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Core</h2><a id="user-content-core" aria-label="Permalink: Core" href="#core"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Each core has a number of compute resources, often built around a certain number of threads it can support. In order to maximize parallelization, these resources need to be managed optimally to maximize resource utilization.</p>
<p dir="auto">In this simplified GPU, each core processed one <strong>block</strong> at a time, and for each thread in a block, the core has a dedicated ALU, LSU, PC, and register file. Managing the execution of thread instructions on these resources is one of the most challening problems in GPUs.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Scheduler</h3><a id="user-content-scheduler" aria-label="Permalink: Scheduler" href="#scheduler"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Each core has a single scheduler that manages the execution of threads.</p>
<p dir="auto">The tiny-gpu scheduler executes instructions for a single block to completion before picking up a new block, and it executes instructions for all threads in-sync and sequentially.</p>
<p dir="auto">In more advanced schedulers, techniques like <strong>pipelining</strong> are used to stream the execution of multiple instructions subsequent instructions to maximize resource utilization before previous instructions are fully complete. Additionally, <strong>warp scheduling</strong> can be use to execute multiple batches of threads within a block in parallel.</p>
<p dir="auto">The main constraint the scheduler has to work around is the latency associated with loading &amp; storing data from global memory. While most instructions can be executed synchronously, these load-store operations are asynchronous, meaning the rest of the instruction execution has to be built around these long wait times.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Fetcher</h3><a id="user-content-fetcher" aria-label="Permalink: Fetcher" href="#fetcher"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Asynchronously fetches the instruction at the current program counter from program memory (most should actually be fetching from cache after a single block is executed).</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Decoder</h3><a id="user-content-decoder" aria-label="Permalink: Decoder" href="#decoder"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Decodes the fetched instruction into control signals for thread execution.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Register Files</h3><a id="user-content-register-files" aria-label="Permalink: Register Files" href="#register-files"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Each thread has it's own dedicated set of register files. The register files hold the data that each thread is performing computations on, which enables the same-instruction multiple-data (SIMD) pattern.</p>
<p dir="auto">Importantly, each register file contains a few read-only registers holding data about the current block &amp; thread being executed locally, enabling kernels to be executed with different data based on the local thread id.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">ALUs</h3><a id="user-content-alus" aria-label="Permalink: ALUs" href="#alus"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Dedicated arithmetic-logic unit for each thread to perform computations. Handles the <code>ADD</code>, <code>SUB</code>, <code>MUL</code>, <code>DIV</code> arithmetic instructions.</p>
<p dir="auto">Also handles the <code>CMP</code> comparison instruction which actually outputs whether the result of the difference between two registers is negative, zero or positive - and stores the result in the <code>NZP</code> register in the PC unit.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">LSUs</h3><a id="user-content-lsus" aria-label="Permalink: LSUs" href="#lsus"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Dedicated load-store unit for each thread to access global data memory.</p>
<p dir="auto">Handles the <code>LDR</code> &amp; <code>STR</code> instructions - and handles async wait times for memory requests to be processed and relayed by the memory controller.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">PCs</h3><a id="user-content-pcs" aria-label="Permalink: PCs" href="#pcs"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Dedicated program-counter for each unit to determine the next instructions to execute on each thread.</p>
<p dir="auto">By default, the PC increments by 1 after every instruction.</p>
<p dir="auto">With the <code>BRnzp</code> instruction, the NZP register checks to see if the NZP register (set by a previous <code>CMP</code> instruction) matches some case - and if it does, it will branch to a specific line of program memory. <em>This is how loops and conditionals are implemented.</em></p>
<p dir="auto">Since threads are processed in parallel, tiny-gpu assumes that all threads "converge" to the same program counter after each instruction - which is a naive assumption for the sake of simplicity.</p>
<p dir="auto">In real GPUs, individual threads can branch to different PCs, causing <strong>branch divergence</strong> where a group of threads threads initially being processed together has to split out into separate execution.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">ISA</h2><a id="user-content-isa" aria-label="Permalink: ISA" href="#isa"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/adam-maj/tiny-gpu/blob/master/docs/images/isa.png"><img src="https://github.com/adam-maj/tiny-gpu/raw/master/docs/images/isa.png" alt="ISA"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">tiny-gpu implements a simple 11 instruction ISA built to enable simple kernels for proof-of-concept like matrix addition &amp; matrix multiplication (implementation further down on this page).</p>
<p dir="auto">For these purposes, it supports the following instructions:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>BRnzp</code> - Branch instruction to jump to another line of program memory if the NZP register matches the <code>nzp</code> condition in the instruction.</li>
<li><code>CMP</code> - Compare the value of two registers and store the result in the NZP register to use for a later <code>BRnzp</code> instruction.</li>
<li><code>ADD</code>, <code>SUB</code>, <code>MUL</code>, <code>DIV</code> - Basic arithmetic operations to enable tensor math.</li>
<li><code>LDR</code> - Load data from global memory.</li>
<li><code>STR</code> - Store data into global memory.</li>
<li><code>CONST</code> - Load a constant value into a register.</li>
<li><code>RET</code> - Signal that the current thread has reached the end of execution.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Each register is specified by 4 bits, meaning that there are 16 total registers. The first 13 register <code>R0</code> - <code>R12</code> are free registers that support read/write. The last 3 registers are special read-only registers used to supply the <code>%blockIdx</code>, <code>%blockDim</code>, and <code>%threadIdx</code> critical to SIMD.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Execution</h2><a id="user-content-execution" aria-label="Permalink: Execution" href="#execution"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Core</h3><a id="user-content-core-1" aria-label="Permalink: Core" href="#core-1"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Each core follows the following control flow going through different stages to execute each instruction:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><code>FETCH</code> - Fetch the next instruction at current program counter from program memory.</li>
<li><code>DECODE</code> - Decode the instruction into control signals.</li>
<li><code>REQUEST</code> - Request data from global memory if necessary (if <code>LDR</code> or <code>STR</code> instruction).</li>
<li><code>WAIT</code> - Wait for data from global memory if applicable.</li>
<li><code>EXECUTE</code> - Execute any computations on data.</li>
<li><code>UPDATE</code> - Update register files and NZP register.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">The control flow is laid out like this for the sake of simplicity and understandability.</p>
<p dir="auto">In practice, several of these steps could be compressed to be optimize processing times, and the GPU could also use <strong>pipelining</strong> to stream and coordinate the execution of many instructions on a cores resources without waiting for previous instructions to finish.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Thread</h3><a id="user-content-thread" aria-label="Permalink: Thread" href="#thread"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/adam-maj/tiny-gpu/blob/master/docs/images/thread.png"><img src="https://github.com/adam-maj/tiny-gpu/raw/master/docs/images/thread.png" alt="Thread"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Each thread within each core follows the above execution path to perform computations on the data in it's dedicated register file.</p>
<p dir="auto">This resembles a standard CPU diagram, and is quite similar in functionality as well. The main difference is that the <code>%blockIdx</code>, <code>%blockDim</code>, and <code>%threadIdx</code> values lie in the read-only registers for each thread, enabling SIMD functionality.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Kernels</h2><a id="user-content-kernels" aria-label="Permalink: Kernels" href="#kernels"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">I wrote a matrix addition and matrix multiplication kernel using my ISA as a proof of concept to demonstrate SIMD programming and execution with my GPU.

<p dir="auto">tiny-gpu is setup to simulate the execution of both of the above kernels. Before simulating, you'll need to install <a href="https://steveicarus.github.io/iverilog/usage/installation.html" rel="nofollow">iverilog</a> and <a href="https://docs.cocotb.org/en/stable/install.html" rel="nofollow">cocotb</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Once you've installed the pre-requisites, you can run the kernel simulations with <code>make test_matadd</code> and <code>make test_matmul</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Executing the simulations will output a log file in <code>test/logs</code> with the initial data memory state, complete execution trace of the kernel, and final data memory state.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you look at the initial data memory state logged at the start of the logfile for each, you should see the two start matrices for the calculation, and in the final data memory at the end of the file you should also see the resultant matrix.</p>
<p dir="auto">Below is a sample of the execution traces, showing on each cycle the execution of every thread within every core, including the current instruction, PC, register values, states, etc.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/adam-maj/tiny-gpu/blob/master/docs/images/trace.png"><img src="https://github.com/adam-maj/tiny-gpu/raw/master/docs/images/trace.png" alt="execution trace"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>For anyone trying to run the simulation or play with this repo, please feel free to DM me on <a href="https://twitter.com/majmudaradam" rel="nofollow">twitter</a> if you run into any issues - I want you to get this running!</strong></p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Advanced Functionality</h2><a id="user-content-advanced-functionality" aria-label="Permalink: Advanced Functionality" href="#advanced-functionality"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">For the sake of simplicity, there were many additional features implemented in modern GPUs that heavily improve performance &amp; functionality that tiny-gpu omits. We'll discuss some of those most critical features in this section.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Multi-layered Cache &amp; Shared Memory</h3><a id="user-content-multi-layered-cache--shared-memory" aria-label="Permalink: Multi-layered Cache &amp; Shared Memory" href="#multi-layered-cache--shared-memory"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">In modern GPUs, multiple different levels of caches are used to minimize the amount of data that needs to get accessed from global memory. tiny-gpu implements only one cache layer between individual compute units requesting memory and the memory controllers which stores recent cached data.</p>
<p dir="auto">Implementing multi-layered caches allows frequently accessed data to be cached more locally to where it's being used (with some caches within individual compute cores), minimizing load times for this data.</p>
<p dir="auto">Different caching algorithms are used to maximize cache-hits - this is a critical dimension that can be improved on to optimize memory access.</p>
<p dir="auto">Additionally, GPUs often use <strong>shared memory</strong> for threads within the same block to access a single memory space that can be used to share results with other threads.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Memory Coalescing</h3><a id="user-content-memory-coalescing" aria-label="Permalink: Memory Coalescing" href="#memory-coalescing"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Another critical memory optimization used by GPUs is <strong>memory coalescing.</strong> Multiple threads running in parallel often need to access sequential addresses in memory (for example, a group of threads accessing neighboring elements in a matrix) - but each of these memory requests is put in separately.</p>
<p dir="auto">Memory coalescing is used to analyzing queued memory requests and combine neighboring requests into a single transaction, minimizing time spent on addressing, and making all the requests together.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Pipelining</h3><a id="user-content-pipelining" aria-label="Permalink: Pipelining" href="#pipelining"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">In the control flow for tiny-gpu, cores wait for one instruction to be executed on a group of threads before starting execution of the next instruction.</p>
<p dir="auto">Modern GPUs use <strong>pipelining</strong> to stream execution of multiple sequential instructions at once while ensuring that instructions with dependencies on each other still get executed sequentially.</p>
<p dir="auto">This helps to maximize resource utilization within cores as resources are not sitting idle while waiting (ex: during async memory requests).</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Warp Scheduling</h3><a id="user-content-warp-scheduling" aria-label="Permalink: Warp Scheduling" href="#warp-scheduling"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Another strategy used to maximize resource utilization on course is <strong>warp scheduling.</strong> This approach involves breaking up blocks into individual batches of theads that can be executed together.</p>
<p dir="auto">Multiple warps can be executed on a single core simultaneously by executing instructions from one warp while another warp is waiting. This is similar to pipelining, but dealing with instructions from different threads.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Branch Divergence</h3><a id="user-content-branch-divergence" aria-label="Permalink: Branch Divergence" href="#branch-divergence"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">tiny-gpu assumes that all threads in a single batch end up on the same PC after each instruction, meaning that threads can be executed in parallel for their entire lifetime.</p>
<p dir="auto">In reality, individual threads could diverge from each other and branch to different lines based on their data. With different PCs, these threads would need to split into separate lines of execution, which requires managing diverging threads &amp; paying attention to when threads converge again.</p>

<p dir="auto">Another core functionality of modern GPUs is the ability to set <strong>barriers</strong> so that groups of threads in a block can synchronize and wait until all other threads in the same block have gotten to a certain point before continuing execution.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is useful for cases where threads need to exchange shared data with each other so they can ensure that the data has been fully processed.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Attributes and properties are <em>fundamentally</em> different things. You can have an attribute and property of the same name set to different values. For example:</p>
<div><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span> <span>foo</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>bar<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>…<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span>
  <span>const</span> div <span>=</span> document<span>.</span><span>querySelector</span><span>(</span><span>'div[foo=bar]'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>div<span>.</span><span>getAttribute</span><span>(</span><span>'foo'</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// 'bar'</span>
  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>div<span>.</span>foo<span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// undefined</span>

  div<span>.</span>foo <span>=</span> <span>'hello world'</span><span>;</span>

  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>div<span>.</span><span>getAttribute</span><span>(</span><span>'foo'</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// 'bar'</span>
  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>div<span>.</span>foo<span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// 'hello world'</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div><p>It seems like fewer and fewer developers know this, partially thanks to frameworks:</p>
<div><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>input</span> <span>className</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>…<span>"</span></span> <span>type</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>…<span>"</span></span> <span>aria-label</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>…<span>"</span></span> <span>value</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>…<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If you do the above in a framework's templating language, you're using attribute-like syntax, but under the hood it'll sometimes be setting the property instead, and when it does that differs from framework to framework. In some cases, it'll set a property <em>and</em> an attribute as a side-effect, but that isn't the framework's fault.</p>
<p>Most of the time, these distinctions don't matter. I think it's good that developers can have a long and happy career without caring about the differences between properties and attributes. But, if you need to dig down into the DOM at a lower level, it helps to know. Even if you feel you know the difference, maybe I'll touch on a couple of details you hadn't considered. So let's dig in…</p>
<h2 id="the-key-differences"><a href="#the-key-differences">The key differences</a></h2>
<p>Before we get to the interesting stuff, let's get some of the technical differences out of the way:</p>
<h3 id="html-serialisation"><a href="#html-serialisation">HTML serialisation</a></h3>
<p>Attributes serialise to HTML, whereas properties don't:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>const</span> div <span>=</span> document<span>.</span><span>createElement</span><span>(</span><span>'div'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

div<span>.</span><span>setAttribute</span><span>(</span><span>'foo'</span><span>,</span> <span>'bar'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
div<span>.</span>hello <span>=</span> <span>'world'</span><span>;</span>

console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>div<span>.</span>outerHTML<span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// '&lt;div foo="bar"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;'</span></code></pre></div><p>So when you're looking at the elements panel in browser developer tools, you're only seeing attributes on elements, not properties.</p>
<h3 id="value-types"><a href="#value-types">Value types</a></h3>
<p>In order to work in the serialised format, attribute values are always strings, whereas properties can be any type:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>const</span> div <span>=</span> document<span>.</span><span>createElement</span><span>(</span><span>'div'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>const</span> obj <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>foo</span><span>:</span> <span>'bar'</span> <span>}</span><span>;</span>

div<span>.</span><span>setAttribute</span><span>(</span><span>'foo'</span><span>,</span> obj<span>)</span><span>;</span>
console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>typeof</span> div<span>.</span><span>getAttribute</span><span>(</span><span>'foo'</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// 'string'</span>
console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>div<span>.</span><span>getAttribute</span><span>(</span><span>'foo'</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// '[object Object]'</span>

div<span>.</span>hello <span>=</span> obj<span>;</span>
console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>typeof</span> div<span>.</span>hello<span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// 'object'</span>
console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>div<span>.</span>hello<span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// { foo: 'bar' }</span></code></pre></div><h3 id="case-sensitivity"><a href="#case-sensitivity">Case sensitivity</a></h3>
<p>Attribute names are case-insensitive, whereas property names are case-sensitive.</p>
<div><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span> <span>id</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>test<span>"</span></span> <span>HeLlO</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>world<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span>
  <span>const</span> div <span>=</span> document<span>.</span><span>querySelector</span><span>(</span><span>'#test'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>div<span>.</span><span>getAttributeNames</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// ['id', 'hello']</span>

  div<span>.</span><span>setAttribute</span><span>(</span><span>'FOO'</span><span>,</span> <span>'bar'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>div<span>.</span><span>getAttributeNames</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// ['id', 'hello', 'foo']</span>

  div<span>.</span>TeSt <span>=</span> <span>'value'</span><span>;</span>
  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>div<span>.</span>TeSt<span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// 'value'</span>
  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>div<span>.</span>test<span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// undefined</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div><p>However, attribute <em>values</em> are case-sensitive.</p>
<p>Ok, here's where things start to get blurry:</p>
<h2 id="reflection"><a href="#reflection">Reflection</a></h2>
<p>Take a look at this:</p>
<div><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span> <span>id</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>foo<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span>
  <span>const</span> div <span>=</span> document<span>.</span><span>querySelector</span><span>(</span><span>'#foo'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>div<span>.</span><span>getAttribute</span><span>(</span><span>'id'</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// 'foo'</span>
  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>div<span>.</span>id<span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// 'foo'</span>

  div<span>.</span>id <span>=</span> <span>'bar'</span><span>;</span>

  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>div<span>.</span><span>getAttribute</span><span>(</span><span>'id'</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// 'bar'</span>
  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>div<span>.</span>id<span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// 'bar'</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This seems to contradict the first example in the post, but the above only works because <code>Element</code> has an <code>id</code> getter &amp; setter that 'reflects' the <code>id</code> attribute.</p>
<p>When a property reflects an attribute, the <em>attribute</em> is the source of the data. When you set the property, it's updating the attribute. When you read from the property, it's reading the attribute.</p>
<p>For convenience, most specs will create a property equivalent for every defined attribute. It didn't work in the example at the start of the article, because <code>foo</code> isn't a spec-defined attribute, so there isn't a spec-defined <code>foo</code> property that reflects it.</p>
<p><a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/grouping-content.html#the-ol-element">Here's the spec for <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code></a>. The "Content attributes" section defines the attributes, and the "DOM interface" defines the properties. If you click on <code>reversed</code> in the DOM interface, it takes you to this:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>The <code>reversed</code> and <code>type</code> IDL attributes must <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/common-dom-interfaces.html#reflect">reflect</a> the respective content attributes of the same name.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But not all of these reflectors are as simple as these.</p>
<h3 id="naming-differences"><a href="#naming-differences">Naming differences</a></h3>
<p>Ok, this is relatively minor, but sometimes the property has a different name to the attribute it reflects.</p>
<p>In some cases it's just to add the kind of casing you'd expect from a property:</p>
<ul>
<li>On <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>, <code>el.crossOrigin</code> reflects the <code>crossorigin</code> attribute.</li>
<li>On all elements, <code>el.ariaLabel</code> reflects the <code>aria-label</code> attribute (the aria reflectors became cross browser in late 2023. Before that you could only use the attributes).</li>
</ul>
<p>In some cases, names had to be changed due to old JavaScript reserved words:</p>
<ul>
<li>On all elements, <code>el.className</code> reflects the <code>class</code> attribute.</li>
<li>On <code>&lt;label&gt;</code>, <code>el.htmlFor</code> reflects the <code>for</code> attribute.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="validation-type-coercion-and-defaults"><a href="#validation-type-coercion-and-defaults">Validation, type coercion, and defaults</a></h3>
<p>Properties come with validation and defaults, whereas attribute don't:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>const</span> input <span>=</span> document<span>.</span><span>createElement</span><span>(</span><span>'input'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>input<span>.</span><span>getAttribute</span><span>(</span><span>'type'</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// null</span>
console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>input<span>.</span>type<span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// 'text'</span>

input<span>.</span>type <span>=</span> <span>'number'</span><span>;</span>

console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>input<span>.</span><span>getAttribute</span><span>(</span><span>'type'</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// 'number'</span>
console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>input<span>.</span>type<span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// 'number'</span>

input<span>.</span>type <span>=</span> <span>'foo'</span><span>;</span>

console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>input<span>.</span><span>getAttribute</span><span>(</span><span>'type'</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// 'foo'</span>
console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>input<span>.</span>type<span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// 'text'</span></code></pre></div><p>In this case, the validation is handled by the <code>type</code> getter. The setter allowed the invalid value <code>'foo'</code>, but when the getter saw the invalid value, or no value, it returned <code>'text'</code>.</p>
<p>Some properties perform type coercion:</p>
<div><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>details</span> <span>open</span><span>&gt;</span></span>…<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>details</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span>
  <span>const</span> details <span>=</span> document<span>.</span><span>querySelector</span><span>(</span><span>'details'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>details<span>.</span><span>getAttribute</span><span>(</span><span>'open'</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// ''</span>
  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>details<span>.</span>open<span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// true</span>

  details<span>.</span>open <span>=</span> <span>false</span><span>;</span>

  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>details<span>.</span><span>getAttribute</span><span>(</span><span>'open'</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// null</span>
  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>details<span>.</span>open<span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// false</span>

  details<span>.</span>open <span>=</span> <span>'hello'</span><span>;</span>

  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>details<span>.</span><span>getAttribute</span><span>(</span><span>'open'</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// ''</span>
  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>details<span>.</span>open<span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// true</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this case, the <code>open</code> property is a boolean, returning whether the attribute exists. The setter also coerces the type - even though the setter is given <code>'hello'</code>, it's turned to a boolean rather than going directly to the attribute.</p>
<p>Properties like <code>img.height</code> coerce the attribute value to a number. The setter converts the incoming value to a number, and treats negative values as 0.</p>
<h3 id="value-on-input-fields"><a href="#value-on-input-fields"><code>value</code> on input fields</a></h3>
<p><code>value</code> is a fun one. There's a <code>value</code> property and a <code>value</code> attribute. However, the <code>value</code> property does not reflect the <code>value</code> attribute. Instead, the <code>defaultValue</code> property reflects the <code>value</code> attribute.</p>
<p>I know, I know.</p>
<p>In fact, the <code>value</code> property doesn't reflect <em>any</em> attribute. That isn't unusual, there's loads of these (<code>offsetWidth</code>, <code>parentNode</code>, <code>indeterminate</code> on checkboxes for some reason, and many more).</p>
<p>Initially, the <code>value</code> property defers to the <code>defaultValue</code> property. Then, once the <code>value</code> property is set, either via JavaScript or through user interaction, it switches to an internal value. It's as if it's implemented <em>roughly</em> like this:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>HTMLInputElement</span> <span>extends</span> <span>HTMLElement</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>get</span> <span>defaultValue</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>getAttribute</span><span>(</span><span>'value'</span><span>)</span> <span>??</span> <span>''</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>set</span> <span>defaultValue</span><span>(</span><span>newValue</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>setAttribute</span><span>(</span><span>'value'</span><span>,</span> <span>String</span><span>(</span>newValue<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>

  #value <span>=</span> <span>undefined</span><span>;</span>

  <span>get</span> <span>value</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span>#value <span>??</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span>defaultValue<span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>set</span> <span>value</span><span>(</span><span>newValue</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span>#value <span>=</span> <span>String</span><span>(</span>newValue<span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>// This happens when the associated form resets</span>
  <span>formResetCallback</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span>#value <span>=</span> <span>undefined</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>So:</p>
<div><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>input</span> <span>type</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>text<span>"</span></span> <span>value</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>default<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span>

</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This would have made way more sense if the <code>value</code> attribute was named <code>defaultvalue</code>. Too late now.</p>
<h2 id="attributes-should-be-for-configuration"><a href="#attributes-should-be-for-configuration">Attributes should be for configuration</a></h2>
<p>In my opinion, attributes should be for configuration, whereas properties can contain state. I also believe that the light-DOM tree should have a single owner.</p>
<p>In that sense, I think <code>&lt;input value&gt;</code> gets it right (aside from the naming). The <code>value</code> attribute configures the default value, whereas the <code>value</code> property gives you the current state.</p>
<p>It also makes sense that validation applies when getting/setting properties, but never when getting/setting attributes.</p>
<p>I say 'in my opinion', because a couple of recent HTML elements have done it differently.</p>
<p>The <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;dialog&gt;</code> elements represent their open state via the <code>open</code> attribute, and the browser will self add/remove this attribute in response to user interaction.</p>
<p>I think this was a design mistake. It breaks the idea that attributes are for configuration, but more importantly it means that the system in charge of maintaining the DOM (a framework, or vanilla JS) needs to be prepared for the DOM to change itself.</p>
<p>I think it should have been:</p>
<div><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>details</span> <span>defaultopen</span><span>&gt;</span></span>…<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>details</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div><p>And a <code>details.open</code> property to get/set the current state, along with a CSS pseudo-class for targeting that state.</p>
<p>I guess <code>contenteditable</code> also breaks that contract, but… well… it's a opt-in to a lot of breakage.</p>
<h2 id="how-frameworks-handle-the-difference"><a href="#how-frameworks-handle-the-difference">How frameworks handle the difference</a></h2>
<p>Back to the example from earlier:</p>
<div><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>input</span> <span>className</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>…<span>"</span></span> <span>type</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>…<span>"</span></span> <span>aria-label</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>…<span>"</span></span> <span>value</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>…<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div><p>How do frameworks handle this?</p>
<h3 id="preact-and-vuejs"><a href="#preact-and-vuejs">Preact and VueJS</a></h3>
<p>Aside from a predefined set of cases where they favour attributes, they'll set the prop as a property if <code>propName in element</code>, otherwise they'll set an attribute. Basically, they prefer properties over attributes. Their render-to-string methods do the opposite, and ignore things that are property-only.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/preactjs/preact/blob/aa95aa924dd5fe28798f2712acdabdc2e9fa38c9/src/diff/props.js#L37"><code>setProperty</code> in Preact</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/vuejs/core/blob/958286e3f050dc707ad1af293e91bfb190bdb191/packages/runtime-dom/src/patchProp.ts#L69"><code>shouldSetAsProp</code> in VueJS</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="react"><a href="#react">React</a></h3>
<p>React does things the other way around. Aside from a predefined set of cases where they favour properties, they'll set an attribute. This makes their render-to-string method similar in logic.</p>
<p>This explains why custom elements don't seem to work in React. Since they're custom, their properties aren't in React's 'predefined list', so they're set as attributes instead. Anything that's property-only on the custom element simply won't work. This will be fixed in React 19, where they'll switch to the Preact/VueJS model for custom elements.</p>
<p>The funny thing is, React popularised using <code>className</code> instead of <code>class</code> in what <em>looks like</em> an attribute. But, even though you're using the property name rather than the attribute name, <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/699d03ce1a175442fe3443e1d1bed14f14e9c197/packages/react-dom-bindings/src/client/ReactDOMComponent.js#L388-L389">React will set the <code>class</code> attribute under the hood</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/699d03ce1a175442fe3443e1d1bed14f14e9c197/packages/react-dom-bindings/src/client/ReactDOMComponent.js#L349"><code>setProp</code> in React</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="lit-html"><a href="#lit-html">lit-html</a></h3>
<p>Lit does things a little differently:</p>
<div><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>input</span> <span>type</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>…<span>"</span></span> <span>.value</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>…<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div><p>It keeps the distinction between attributes and properties, requiring you to prefix the name with <code>.</code> if you want to set the property rather than the attribute.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://lit.dev/docs/templates/expressions/">Lit's expression docs</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="and-thats-yer-lot"><a href="#and-thats-yer-lot">And that's yer lot</a></h2>
<p>That's pretty much everything I know about the difference between properties and attributes. If there's something I've missed, or you have a question, let me know in the comments below!</p>

Training on multiple GPUs is a complex task compared to training on a single GPU. Why? When we train on a single GPU, the Optimizer state, parameters and gradients reside in a single system, which helps iterating over models on one GPU.</p><p id="c422">Now, if we add another GPU, there are two systems that will train the models, each with its own state(Optimizer state, parameters and gradients). After one epoch or several steps, we would like to obtain a single result. Now imagine two systems training two batches of data in parallel; they need to communicate about their state and converge the results with minimal data loss. There are multiple ways to utilize multiple GPUs: we can replicate parameters, gradients, and optimizer state across all GPUs, or we could shard only the optimizer state, or the optimizer state and gradients. DeepSpeed helps in distributing the load over the GPUs without any issues.

Rice is a staple of Thai cuisine and is served with almost every meal, whether it is stir-fried, boiled, or used to make congee or fried rice. Noodles, made from rice or wheat, are also very popular and can be found served with various broths, sauces, and toppings in many Thai dishes. Thai food is known for its use of fresh herbs and spices such as lemongrass, galangal, coriander, basil, kaffir lime leaves, ginger, and garlic, which give the dishes their distinct flavors. Thai chilies are also widely used to add varying levels of heat to the food. Some popular Thai dishes include Tom Yum soup (hot and sour soup with lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves, and chilies), Pad Thai (stir-fried rice noodles with vegetables, peanuts, and a tangy sauce), and green curry (a spicy curry made with green chilies, coconut milk, and Thai basil). Many Thai dishes are also accompanied by a variety of sauces and condiments, including fish sauce, soy sauce, chili paste, and tamarind sauce. Fresh fruits like mango, papaya, and pineapple are also commonly enjoyed as a sweet ending to a meal. Overall, Thai food is a vibrant and flavorful cuisine that combines traditional ingredients and cooking techniques with a balance of flavors that tantalize the taste buds.&lt;|eot_id|&gt;</span></pre><p id="9238">Do send my model and dataset some love if it has any worth :)</p><p id="45d9"><a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/sumandas/openhermes-2.5-llama3" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">sumandas/openhermes-2.5-llama3 · Datasets at Hugging Face</a></p><p id="2c72"><a href="https://huggingface.co/sumandas/llama3-openhermes-2.5" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">sumandas/llama3-openhermes-2.5 · Hugging Face</a></p></div></div>]]></description>

<p><em><strong>UPDATED 4/24/24 at 5:48 PM ET with details from an Air Force press release and comments from CCA vendors.&nbsp;</strong></em></p>
<p><span>WASHINGTON — Defense startup Anduril and drone maker General Atomics Aeronautical Systems (GA-ASI) have been picked by the Air Force to build and test drone prototypes for the next phase of the service’s</span><a href="https://breakingdefense.com/tag/collaborative-combat-aircraft/"> <span>Collaborative Combat Aircraft</span></a><span> program, the Air Force announced tonight.</span></p>
<p><span>The Air Force’s decision winnows down a pool of five competitors to two. As a result, three other vendors — Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman — have been eliminated from the running.</span></p>

<p><span>“The companies not selected to build these production representative CCA vehicles, and execute the flight test program, will continue to be part of the broader industry partner vendor pool consisting of more than 20 companies to compete for future efforts, including future production contracts,” the Air Force said.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As Breaking Defense</span><a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2023/12/exclusive-5-companies-in-early-running-for-air-forces-cca-drone-wingmen/#:~:text=Boeing%2C%20General%20Atomics%2C%20Lockheed%20Martin,aircraft%2C%20Breaking%20Defense%20has%20learned."> <span>first reported</span></a><span>, the five contractors were previously picked by the Air Force for the program’s first phase, which largely focused on design work. Today’s selection narrows down the vendors who will take their designs from the drawing board to the real world. As Air Force acquisition chief Andrew Hunter recently told lawmakers in a congressional hearing, the upcoming CCA stage will see those vendors “complete detailed designs, build prototypes and test production-representative test articles.”</span></p>

<p><span>Unveiled by the service as a major multibillion dollar program in the fiscal year 2024 budget, the CCA effort aims to initially field</span><a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2023/03/air-force-plans-nominal-buy-of-200-ngad-fighters-1000-drone-wingmen-kendall-says/"><span> as many as 1,000 drones</span></a><span>. According to the service’s press release today, officials plan to make a “competitive production decision” by FY26 for the first round of CCA work and “field a fully operational capability before the end of the decade.”</span></p>
<p><b><i>RELATED:</i></b><a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2024/04/in-a-world-first-darpa-project-demonstrates-ai-dogfighting-in-real-jet/"> <b><i>In a ‘world first,’ DARPA project demonstrates AI dogfighting in a real jet</i></b></a></p>


<p><span>At the Air &amp; Space Forces Association Warfare Symposium in February,</span><a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2024/02/air-force-plans-cca-downselect-within-months-second-increment-in-fy25-kendall/"> <span>Kendall revealed</span></a><span> that the CCA competition underway right now would be the program’s first “increment,” with a second to follow in the FY25 budget. That second increment would provide vendors eliminated today, as well as</span><a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2024/02/take-2-kratos-aims-for-prime-status-on-second-cca-increment/"> <span>new ones</span></a><span>, another shot at a CCA contract.</span><a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2023/10/is-a-us-aussie-japanese-loyal-wingman-drone-in-the-cards/"> <span>International collaboration</span></a><span> could also feature in the second increment, Kendall said, and the service’s release today indicated foreign military sales could be on the table for the program.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>During the February roundtable, Kendall further revealed the “possibility” that more than one vendor could see their drone bid enter service for the first increment. He also floated the chance of carrying up to three vendors through the preceding test phase if industry helped share some of the cost.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>With only two vendors making the cut today, it’s unclear if that idea bore any fruit. Asked recently whether industry was convinced to pick up some of the tab, Hunter told reporters that “cost sharing is not core to our approach on CCA.”</span></p>
<p><span>The service’s press release today said that the down select decision “does not exclude any of the vendors from competing for the future Increment 1 production contract” — likely suggesting companies would have to spend internal funds to move their designs forward and compete for an eventual production deal.</span></p>
<h2><b>What Companies Pitched, And What Comes Next</b></h2>
<p><span>When it comes to specific designs, GA-ASI has</span><a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2023/11/general-atomics-exec-eyes-williams-pratt-engines-as-company-searches-for-cca-propulsion/"> <span>stated</span></a><span> that the company’s Gambit drone family would be its entry, while</span><a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2023/09/defense-startup-anduril-acquires-uas-maker-blue-force-technologies/"> <span>Anduril’s acquisition</span></a><span> last year of autonomous aircraft vendor Blue Force positioned the Fury drone to be Anduril’s bid. In images today touting the company’s win, Anduril showcased the Fury drone, appearing to confirm the drone was the company’s bid.</span></p>
<p><span>“There is no time to waste on business as usual. With the CCA program, Secretary Kendall and the Air Force have embraced a fast-moving, forward-looking approach to field autonomous systems at speed and scale,” Anduril CEO and Co-Founder Brian Schimpf said in a statement. “We are honored to be selected for this unprecedented opportunity, which signals a demand for continued expansion of the defense industrial base. Anduril is proud to pave the way for other non-traditional defense companies to compete and deliver on large scale programs.”</span></p>
<p><span>“Throughout our 30-year history, GA-ASI has been at the forefront of rapidly advancing unmanned aircraft systems that support our warfighters,” GA-ASI President David Alexander said in a statement. “The USAF is moving forward with GA-ASI due to our focused commitment to unmanned air-to-air combat operations and unmatched UAS experience, ensuring the production of the CCA aircraft at scale to deliver affordable combat mass for the warfighter.”</span></p>
<p><span>Boeing said in a statement today that the aerospace giant offered a “proprietary solution tailored to the U.S. Air Force’s unique CCA phase one requirements,” and did not pitch the MQ-25 Stingray or MQ-28 Ghost Bat.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“While we are disappointed that we won’t be moving forward in this phase of the Air Force’s CCA program, we are undeterred in our commitment to providing next-generation autonomous combat aircraft for U.S. and global military customers. Work continues on our robust and growing autonomous family, including the MQ-25 Stingray and future derivatives, the MQ-28 Ghost Bat, and a number of proprietary programs we can’t disclose,” Boeing said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Lockheed and Northrop have also not confirmed what candidates they put forward.</span></p>
<p><span>In a statement, Lockheed said</span><span> the company “remains committed to advancing the state of the art in autonomous systems for air and ground missions. Our work to develop and integrate pathfinding open architectures, ground control systems like the Multi-Domain Combat System™, human factors interfaces, and mission systems continues. For some time, we’ve been focused on bringing to life the transformative power of autonomous and AI/ML enabled operations in crewed and uncrewed DoD systems, with particular focus on integrating CCA with F-35 and F-22. These commitments and work are ongoing.”</span></p>
<p><span>A representative for Northrop did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A second parallel effort under CCA is also known to be working on the drones’ autonomous software, though it’s unclear what companies are involved. Hunter</span><a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2023/05/air-force-expects-sizeable-vendor-pool-for-drone-wingmen/"> <span>said last year</span></a><span> the service already had 20 to 30 vendors working on that element of CCA work, and more recently said in February that the autonomy piece would continue independent of progress on the hardware side.</span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

   
<i>Pieter P, 08-03-2017</i>
   <p>
        Some time ago, I wrote <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/A-Beginners-Guide-to-Arduino/">a Beginner's Guide to Arduino</a> that seems to be very popular, so I decided to create a follow-up: <b>A Beginner's Guide to the ESP8266</b>. That's right, a tutorial on how to use the world's most popular $3 Wi-Fi board.
   </p>
   
   <p>
        This is going to be a very in-depth tutorial, covering some networking concepts as well. If you're a beginner, and just want to go straight to the more exciting Wi-Fi part, feel free to do so, I included short <i>TL;DR's </i>in the longer, more technical parts.
   </p>
   
   <p>
        A short overview of what I'll cover in this article: 
   </p>
   <div>
       <ol>
           <li><b>What is an ESP8266?</b> A short overview of what an ESP8266 is, and what you can do with it</li>
           <li><b>Deciding on what board to buy</b>: There's loads of different ESP8266 available these days, finding the one that's best for you can be hard</li>
           <li><b>Installing the software</b>: you need to install some software to program the ESP8266, and maybe a USB driver</li>
           <li><b>Setting up the hardware</b>: some modules and boards need some external components</li>
           <li><b>The ESP8266 as a microcontroller</b>: the ESP8266 can be used as a normal microcontroller, just like an Arduino</li>
           <li><b>Network protocols</b>: Before we start using the Wi-Fi capabilities of the ESP8266, I'll teach you some of the network protocols involved</li>
           <li><b>Setting up a Wi-Fi connection</b>: That's probably why you're reading this, right?</li>
           <li><b>Name resolution</b>: Find the ESP8266 on your local network using mDNS</li>
           <li><b>Setting up a simple web server</b>: This enables you to add web pages to the ESP8266, and browse them from your computer or phone</li>
           <li><b>Setting up an advanced web server</b>: a more advanced server with a real file system that allows you to upload new files over Wi-Fi</li>
           <li><b>OTA - uploading programs over Wi-Fi</b>: You don't have to upload programs over USB, you can use Wi-Fi instead</li>
           <li><b>Wirelessly controlling your RGB lighting</b>: Change the color of your LED strips using your phone or computer</li>
           <li><b>Getting the time</b>: Connect to a time server using NTP and sync the ESP's clock</li>
           <li><b>Monitoring sensors</b>: log the temperature in your living room, save it in flash memory and show it in a fancy graph in your browser</li>
           <li><b>Getting email notifications</b>: Turn on a notification light when you've got unread emails</li>
           <li><b>Advanced features</b>: use DNS, captive portals, Wi-Fi connector libraries, OSC ...</li>
       </ol>
   </div>
   
   <p>
        This guide expects some basic knowledge of microcontrollers like the Arduino. If that's something you're not already familiar with, I'd recommend you to read my <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/A-Beginners-Guide-to-Arduino/">Beginner's Guide to Arduino</a> first, it covers a lot of the basics that I won't go into in this article.
   </p>
   <p>
        I really want to focus on the ESP8266-specific things, like Wi-Fi and other network protocols, the ESP's hardware, software, IoT, etc ...
   </p>
   <h3>What is an ESP8266?</h3>
   <p>
        The ESP8266 is a System on a Chip (SoC), manufactured by the Chinese company <a href="https://espressif.com/en/">Espressif</a>. It consists of a Tensilica L106 32-bit <b>micro controller</b> unit (MCU) and a <b>Wi-Fi transceiver</b>. It has <b>11 GPIO pins</b>* (General Purpose Input/Output pins), and an <b>analog input</b> as well. This means that you can program it like any normal Arduino or other microcontroller. And on top of that, you get Wi-Fi communication, so you can use it to connect to your Wi-Fi network, connect to the Internet, host a web server with real web pages, let your smartphone connect to it, etc ... The possibilities are endless! It's no wonder that this chip has become the most popular IOT device available. 
   </p>
   
   <p>
        There are many different modules available, standalone modules like the <a href="http://en.ai-thinker.com/html/Products/WIFI_Module/ESP_01-14Series/">ESP-## series</a> by AI Thinker, or complete development boards like the <a href="http://nodemcu.com/index_en.html">NodeMCU DevKit</a> or the <a href="http://www.wemos.cc/">WeMos D1</a>. Different boards may have different pins broken out, have different Wi-Fi antennas, or a different amount of flash memory on board.
   </p>
   
   <p><small>(*) The ESP8266 chip itself has 17 GPIO pins, but 6 of these pins (6-11) are used for communication with the on-board flash memory chip.</small>
   </p>
   <h3>Programming</h3>
   <p>
        There are different ways to program the ESP8266, but I'll only cover the method using the Arduino IDE. This is really easy for beginners, and it's a very familiar environment if you've used Arduino boards before. 
   </p>
   <p>
        Just keep in mind that it's not limited to this option: there's also an official SDK available to program it in real C, this is very useful if you want to optimize your code or do some advanced tricks that aren't supported by the Arduino IDE. Another possibility is to flash it with a <a href="https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-firmware">LUA</a> interpreter, so you can upload and run LUA scripts. Or maybe you're more familiar with Python? Then you should check out the <a href="http://micropython.org/download#esp8266">MicroPython firmware</a> to interpret MicroPython scripts. I'm sure there's other languages available as well, so just do a quick Google search and write your code in the language of your choice.
   </p>
   <h3>Requirements</h3>
   <p>
        You'll need a couple of things in order to follow this guide:
   </p>
   <div>
       <ul>
           <li>An ESP8266 board</li>
           <li>A computer that can run the Arduino IDE (Windows, Mac or Linux)</li>
           <li>A USB-to-Serial converter, it is very important that you use a <b>3.3V</b> model*</li>
           <li>A USB cable</li>
           <li>A 3.3V power supply or voltage regulator*</li>
           <li>A Wi-Fi network to connect to</li>
       </ul>
       <p><small>(*) Your board may already include these. More information can be found in the next chapter.</small>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          <p>Here’s Dave Rupert (<a href="https://notes.jim-nielsen.com/#2024-03-22T1029">from my notes</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the goal of a book isn’t to get to the last page, it’s to expand your thinking.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have to constantly remind myself of this. Especially in an environment that prioritizes optimizing and maximizing personal productivity, where it seems if you can’t measure (let alone remember) the impact of a book in your life then it wasn’t worth reading.</p>
<p>I don’t believe that, but I never quite had the words for expressing why I don’t believe that. Dave’s articulation hit pretty close.</p>
<p>Then a couple days later my wife sent me this quote from Ralph Waldo Emerson:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I cannot remember the books I've read any more than the meals I have eaten; even so, they have made me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>YES!</p>
<p>Damn, great writers are sO gOOd wITh wORdz, amirite?</p>
<p>Emerson articulates with acute brevity something I couldn’t suss out in my own thoughts, let alone put into words. It makes me jealous.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I wanted to write this down to reinforce remembering it.</p>
<p>And in a similar vein for the online world: I cannot remember the blog posts I’ve read any more than the meals I’ve eaten; even so, they’ve made me.</p>
<p>It’s a good reminder to be mindful of my content diet — you are what you <del>eat</del> read, even if you don’t always remember it.</p>
<h2 id="update-2024-04-12">Update 2024-04-12</h2>
<p><a href="https://mastodon.online/@halas#.">@halas@mastodon.social</a> shared this story in response, which I really liked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the university I had a professor who had a class with us in the first year and then in the second. At the beginning of the second year’s classes he asked us something from the material of previous year. When met with silence he nodded thoughtfully and said: “Education is something you have even if you don't remember anything”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I love stories that stick with people like that, e.g. “something a teacher told me once...”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-dtm-region="articulo_cuerpo"><p>It’s rush hour on Rue de Rivoli, one of the main arteries of the French capital. The bicycles pass one after another in quick succession, ringing their bell when a pedestrian crosses without looking. Five years ago, it was cars that monopolized this three-kilometer axis that runs in front of Paris City Hall and <a href="https://english.elpais.com/culture/2023-07-01/the-restitution-of-art-to-its-origins.html">the Louvre Museum</a>. Not anymore. Two-wheel transportation has prevailed, favored by a paradigm shift in urban mobility. The cycling revolution, promoted by local authorities, is beginning to bear fruit: according to a recent study by the Paris Région Institute, a public agency, bicycles already surpass cars as a means of transportation in the interior of Paris, accounting for 11.2% of trips compared to 4.3%. A similar trend is seen in trips between the suburbs and the city center: 14% are made by bicycle and 11.8% by car.</p><p>Rue de Rivoli, with its two-way cycle lanes and its dedicated lane for buses and taxis, is perhaps one of the most emblematic examples of the change that the city has experienced in recent years. But it’s not the only one. The perpendicular Boulevard de Sébastopol has become the route most frequented by cyclists, with figures that usually exceed 10,000 daily trips, according to the count kept by the association Paris en Selle.</p><p>When it is sunny, the density can be so high that traffic jams sometimes occur, and the narrowness of the lane causes friction between bikes, creating moments of tension. City officials led by Mayor Anne Hidalgo, a Socialist, have tried to remedy this situation by building other bike lanes on parallel streets.</p><p>From north to south and east to west, the map of the capital has been filled with infrastructure that gives the bicycle a privileged place. Paris has more than 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) of facilities adapted for cyclists, including more than 300 km (186 m) of bike lanes and 52 km (32 m) of provisional lanes, according to the latest available municipal data, from 2021. The rest are lanes shared with cars or lanes only marked with paint on the ground.</p><p>By 2026, local officials want the entire city to be suitable for two-wheel transportation. To this end, it has set aside $250 million, $100 million more than in Hidalgo’s first term. This summer’s Olympic Games will serve as an accelerator of this new “bike plan,” with routes that will allow access to the Olympic venues.</p><p>But there is still some way to go. The Paris en Selle association warns that only 27% of the “bike plan” has been carried out despite the fact that 62% of Hidalgo’s second term in office has already elapsed. The Deputy Mayor of Paris for Transportation, David Belliard, acknowledges that there are delays, but does not lose hope. Progress is noticeable.</p><p>In some thoroughfares, the number of bikes already surpasses vehicles. Between 2022 and 2023, the use of bike lanes doubled at peak times, according to data collected by the capital’s 128 counters. The goal is to create a network of cycling paths that run along the busiest metro lines, to unclog public transit and offer an equally fast and safe alternative for commuters.</p><p>The number of people who travel by bicycle has increased exponentially. Vélib, the municipal urban bicycle rental service, has increased its fleet with 3,000 new bikes since March. Edmée Doroszlai, a 62-year-old Parisian, still remembers the first time she started riding on two wheels in the early 1980s. “It was monstrous, almost impossible and very dangerous,” she says from the center of Paris, with her bike at her side.</p><p>“There is also a big change in how men behave when they see a woman on a bike,” she adds, alluding to the normalization of its use. The presence of adapted infrastructure, she confirms, has encouraged her to use it more, as have many families who travel on cycle paths with small children.</p><p>“We still have to go further,” Belliard insisted in an interview with BFMTV earlier this month. The councilor was reacting to the study by the Paris Région Institute, the regional urban planning and environment agency, which indicated that 11.2% of trips in Paris were made by bike between 2022 and 2023, compared to 4.3% by car. The change in trend is clear. In 2021, two wheels still represented 5.6% of trips, while cars were 9%, according to Belliard.</p><figure><span><img alt="Notre Dame" decoding="auto" height="262" srcset="https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/QUBHQ6LEH2CCT3MOQ2GH7ABCC4.jpg?auth=9815ecb7d31b0dfd6408c2465c80f0735bd2e8c3f36692e516985133b830715d&amp;width=414 414w,https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/QUBHQ6LEH2CCT3MOQ2GH7ABCC4.jpg?auth=9815ecb7d31b0dfd6408c2465c80f0735bd2e8c3f36692e516985133b830715d&amp;width=828 640w,https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/QUBHQ6LEH2CCT3MOQ2GH7ABCC4.jpg?auth=9815ecb7d31b0dfd6408c2465c80f0735bd2e8c3f36692e516985133b830715d&amp;width=980 1000w,https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/QUBHQ6LEH2CCT3MOQ2GH7ABCC4.jpg?auth=9815ecb7d31b0dfd6408c2465c80f0735bd2e8c3f36692e516985133b830715d&amp;width=1960 1960w" width="414" sizes="(min-width:1199px) 1155px,(min-width:1001px) calc(100vw - 44px),(min-width:768px) 767px, 100vw" src="https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/QUBHQ6LEH2CCT3MOQ2GH7ABCC4.jpg?auth=9815ecb7d31b0dfd6408c2465c80f0735bd2e8c3f36692e516985133b830715d&amp;width=414" loading="lazy"></span><figcaption><span>Bike path on the banks of the Seine, in Paris.</span><span>Ciclistas y 'pic-nics' en la orilla sur del Sena, en París (Jon Hicks)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In addition to surpassing the car as a means of travel within Paris, the research indicates that residents of the nearest suburbs also prefer to use the bike, with 14% of trips compared to 11.8% for cars. The figures are even better during rush hour, when 18.9% of trips are made by bike and only 6.6% by car. Travel on foot, however, continues to lead mobility within the municipality with 53%, followed by those made on public transit, with 30%. The study was carried out with 3,337 residents of the capital region who agreed to be fitted with a GPS tracker.</p><p>The bike gradually gained popularity during the public transist strike that paralyzed the capital in December 2019, in protest of <a href="https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-03-17/france-braces-for-more-unrest-after-macron-passes-pension-reform-by-decree.html">President Emmanuel Macron’s pension reform</a>. But it was also prominent <a href="https://english.elpais.com/society/2023-05-20/millions-ditched-cars-for-bikes-during-the-pandemic-these-cities-want-the-habit-to-stick.html">after the Covid confinement</a> in 2020, when the city tested the so-called “coronapistes,” temporary cycling lanes that progressively became permanent. Like Rivoli’s.</p><h3>Better connections with neighborhoods</h3><p>“The network is very good,” says Arnaud Faure, 31, co-owner of the Bivouac Cycles bicycle repair shop in Saint Ouen, a banlieue (suburb) in the north of the city. He has been in the French capital for two years and every day he travels 13 km (8 miles) to get to work and again the same to get back home. He says that almost all of his journey is along bike paths. But he cites two drawbacks. On one hand, the lack of safe parking, a determining factor for bicycle use. On the other hand, the fact that “just like in big cities, traffic is dense and can sometimes be dangerous.”</p><p>In 12 years, car traffic has decreased by 40% in Paris, according to City Hall. “But these rapid changes in habits have been accompanied by tension” in the streets, the mayor has admitted. “It takes time for everyone to find their place and feel safe,” she added, following road regulations that seek to raise awareness about the shared use of public space. Last summer, posters appeared throughout the city reminding everyone that pedestrians have the priority and that the speed limit for cars is 30 km/h (18 mph).</p><p>The city’s plan includes increasing the number of parking spaces for bicycles. The goal is to build more than 130,000 new spots. “Parking at train stations must be developed on a massive scale,” stresses Aymeric Cotard, 29, a member of the association Mieux se déplacer à bicyclette [Better to get around by bike]. One of the large projects that should be completed this year, with 1,200 spaces, is located just behind the Gare du Nord, one of the busiest stations in France. For Cotard, however, it will be insufficient. In <a href="https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-02-27/we-didnt-know-if-they-were-being-taken-to-another-country-where-do-stolen-dutch-bikes-go.html">the Dutch city</a> of Utrecht, the station has 12,500 spaces for bikes.</p><p>The idea is that people who live in the suburbs and take the train daily to work will also use the bicycle once they arrive in Paris. It is one of the main challenges of the coming years, along with facilitating continuous journeys between the capital and its suburbs. “This requires the banlieue cities to do their job and the city of Paris to also improve its entrances, which are inhospitable and unpleasant by bike,” warns Cotard. In addition, it is necessary to provide infrastructure for a flow of cyclists that will be even greater in the future.</p><p>The process takes time and has encountered some opposition. But the morphology of the city is changing, adapting to the bike. And, with it, its resilience to the effects of climate change.</p><p><i>Sign up for </i><a href="https://plus.elpais.com/newsletters/lnp/1/333/?lang=en"><i><u>our weekly newsletter</u></i></a> <i>to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA Edition</i></p></div></div>]]></description>

		<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_transmission_unit">Maximum Transmission Unit</a> – MTU – of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet">Ethernet</a> frame is 1500 bytes.</p>
<p>1500 bytes is a bit out there as numbers go, or at least it seems that way if you touch computers for a living. It’s not a power of two or anywhere close, it’s <em>suspiciously</em> base-ten-round, and computers don’t care all that much about base ten, so how did we get here? </p>
<p>Well, today I learned that the size of an Ethernet header – 36 bytes – comes from the fact that MTU plus Ethernet header is 1536 bytes, which is 12288 bits, which takes 2^12 microseconds to transmit at 3Mb/second, because the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerox_Alto">Xerox Alto</a> computer for which Ethernet was invented had a internal data path that ran at 3Mhz, so the interface could <em>just</em> write the bits into the Alto’s memory at the precise speed at which they arrived, saving the very-expensive-then cost of extra silicon for an interface or any buffering hardware. </p>
<p>Now, “we need to pick just the right magic number <em>here</em> so we can take data straight off the wire and blow it directly into the memory of this specific machine over <em>there</em>” is to any modern sensibilities insane. It’s obviously, dangerously insane. But back when the idea of network security didn’t exist because computers barely existed and networks mostly didn’t exist and unvetted and unsanctioned access to those networks definitely didn’t exist, I bet it seemed like a very reasonable tradeoff.</p>
<p>It really is amazing how many of the things we sort of ambiently accept as standards today, if we even realize we’re making that decision at all, are what they are only because some now-esoteric property of the now-esoteric hardware on which the tech was first invented let the inventors save a few bucks.</p>

</div><div wd_resize="formatNews" wd_print_url="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2024-04-24-IBM-to-Acquire-HashiCorp-Inc-Creating-a-Comprehensive-End-to-End-Hybrid-Cloud-Platform?printable=1"><p>,  /<a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/" target="_blank">PRNewswire</a>/ -- IBM (NYSE: <a href="http://www.ibm.com/investor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">IBM</a>) and HashiCorp Inc. (NASDAQ: HCP), a leading multi-cloud infrastructure automation company, today announced they have entered into a definitive agreement under which IBM will acquire HashiCorp for <span>$35</span> per share in cash, representing an enterprise value of <span>$6.4 billion</span>. HashiCorp's suite of products provides enterprises with extensive Infrastructure Lifecycle Management and Security Lifecycle Management capabilities to enable organizations to automate their hybrid and multi-cloud environments. Today's announcement is a continuation of IBM's deep focus and investment in hybrid cloud and AI, the two most transformational technologies for clients today.</p>

<p><a href="https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2319830/IBM_LOGO_1.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="IBM Corporation logo. (PRNewsfoto/IBM Corporation)" src="https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2319830/IBM_LOGO_1.jpg" title="IBM Corporation logo. (PRNewsfoto/IBM Corporation)"> </a></p>

<p>"Enterprise clients are wrestling with an unprecedented expansion in infrastructure and applications across public and private clouds, as well as on-prem environments. The global excitement surrounding generative AI has exacerbated these challenges and CIOs and developers are up against dramatic complexity in their tech strategies," said <span>Arvind Krishna</span>, IBM chairman and chief executive officer. "HashiCorp has a proven track record of enabling clients to manage the complexity of today's infrastructure and application sprawl. Combining IBM's portfolio and expertise with HashiCorp's capabilities and talent will create a comprehensive hybrid cloud platform designed for the AI era."</p>

<p>The rise of cloud-native workloads and associated applications is driving a radical expansion in the number of cloud workloads enterprises are managing. In addition, generative AI deployment continues to grow alongside traditional workloads. As a result, developers are working with increasingly heterogeneous, dynamic, and complex infrastructure strategies. This represents a massive challenge for technology professionals.</p>

<p>HashiCorp's capabilities enable enterprises to use automation to deliver lifecycle management for infrastructure and security, providing a system of record for the critical workflows needed for hybrid and multi-cloud environments. HashiCorp's Terraform is the industry standard for infrastructure provisioning in these environments. HashiCorp's offerings help clients take a cloud-agnostic, and highly interoperable approach to multi-cloud management, and complement IBM's commitment to industry collaboration (including deep and expanding partnerships with hyperscale cloud service providers), developer communities, and open-source hybrid cloud and AI innovation.</p>

<p>"Our strategy at its core is about enabling companies to innovate in the cloud, while providing a consistent approach to managing cloud at scale. The need for effective management and automation is critical with the rise of multi-cloud and hybrid cloud, which is being accelerated by today's AI revolution," said <span>Armon Dadgar</span>, HashiCorp co-founder and chief technology officer. "I'm incredibly excited by today's news and to be joining IBM to accelerate HashiCorp's mission and expand access to our products to an even broader set of developers and enterprises."</p>

<p>"Today is an exciting day for our dedicated teams across the world as well as the developer communities we serve," said <span>Dave McJannet</span>, HashiCorp chief executive officer. "IBM's leadership in hybrid cloud along with its rich history of innovation, make it the ideal home for HashiCorp as we enter the next phase of our growth journey. I'm proud of the work we've done as a standalone company, I am excited to be able to help our customers further, and I look forward to the future of HashiCorp as part of IBM."</p>

<p><b>Transaction Rationale</b></p>

<ul type="disc">
	<li><b>Strong Strategic Fit – </b>The acquisition of HashiCorp by IBM creates a comprehensive end-to-end hybrid cloud platform built for AI-driven complexity. The combination of each company's portfolio and talent will deliver clients extensive application, infrastructure and security lifecycle management capabilities</li>
	<li><b>Accelerates growth in key focus areas – </b>Upon close, HashiCorp is expected to drive significant synergies for IBM, including across multiple strategic growth areas like Red Hat, watsonx, data security, IT automation and Consulting. For example, the powerful combination of Red Hat's Ansible Automation Platform's configuration management and Terraform's automation will simplify provisioning and configuration of applications across hybrid cloud environments. The two companies also anticipate an acceleration of HashiCorp's growth initiatives by leveraging IBM's world-class go-to-market strategy, scale, and reach, operating in more than 175 countries across the globe</li>
	<li><b>Expands Total Addressable Market (TAM) – </b>The acquisition will create the opportunity to deliver more comprehensive hybrid and multi-cloud offerings to enterprise clients. HashiCorp's offerings, combined with IBM and Red Hat, will give clients a platform to automate the deployment and orchestration of workloads across evolving infrastructure including hyperscale cloud service providers, private clouds and on-prem environments. This will enhance IBM's ability to address the total cloud opportunity, which according to IDC had a TAM of <span>$1.1 trillion</span> in 2023, with a compound annual growth rate in the high teens through 2027.<sup>1</sup></li>
	<li><b>Attractive Financial Opportunity – </b>The transaction will accelerate IBM's growth profile over time driven by go-to-market and product synergies. This growth combined with operating efficiencies, is expected to achieve substantial near-term margin expansion for the acquired business. It is anticipated that the transaction will be accretive to Adjusted EBITDA within the first full year, post close, and free cash flow in year two.</li>
</ul>

<p>HashiCorp boasts a roster of more than 4,400 clients, including Bloomberg, Comcast, Deutsche Bank, GitHub, J.P Morgan Chase, Starbucks and Vodafone. HashiCorp's offerings have widescale adoption in the developer community and are used by 85% of the Fortune 500. Their community products across infrastructure and security were downloaded more than 500 million times in HashiCorp's FY2024 and include:</p>

<ul type="disc">
	<li><b>Terraform</b> – provides organizations with a single workflow to provision their cloud, private datacenter, and SaaS infrastructure and continuously manage infrastructure throughout its lifecycle</li>
	<li><b>Vault</b> – provides organizations with identity-based security to automatically authenticate and authorize access to secrets and other sensitive data</li>
	<li><b>Additional products</b> – <i>Boundary</i> for secure remote access;<i> Consul</i> for service-based networking; <i>Nomad</i> for workload orchestration; <i>Packer</i> for building and managing images as code; and <i>Waypoint</i> internal developer platform</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Transaction Details</b></p>

<p>Under the terms of the agreement, IBM will acquire HashiCorp for <span>$35</span> per share in cash, or <span>$6.4 billion</span> enterprise value, net of cash. HashiCorp will be acquired with available cash on hand.</p>

<p>The boards of directors of IBM and HashiCorp have both approved the transaction. The acquisition is subject to approval by HashiCorp shareholders, regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.</p>

<p>The Company's largest shareholders and investors, who collectively hold approximately 43% of the voting power of&nbsp;HashiCorp's outstanding common stock, entered into a voting agreement with IBM pursuant to which each has agreed to vote all of their common shares in favor of the transaction and against any alternative transactions.</p>

<p>The transaction is expected to close by the end of 2024.</p>

<p><i><b>Additional Information and Where to Find It</b></i></p>

<p><i>HashiCorp, Inc. ("HashiCorp"), the members of HashiCorp's board of directors and certain of HashiCorp's executive officers are participants in the solicitation of proxies from stockholders in connection with the pending acquisition of HashiCorp (the "Transaction"). HashiCorp plans to file a proxy statement (the "Transaction Proxy Statement") with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") in connection with the solicitation of proxies to approve the Transaction. <span>David McJannet</span>, <span>Armon Dadgar</span>, <span>Susan St. Ledger</span>, <span>Todd Ford</span>, <span>David Henshall</span>, <span>Glenn Solomon</span> and <span>Sigal Zarmi</span>, all of whom are members of HashiCorp's board of directors, and <span>Navam Welihinda</span>, HashiCorp's chief financial officer, are participants in HashiCorp's solicitation. Information regarding such participants, including their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, will be included in the Transaction Proxy Statement and other relevant documents to be filed with the SEC in connection with the Transaction. Additional information about such participants is available under the captions "Board of Directors and Corporate Governance," "Executive Officers" and "Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management" in HashiCorp's definitive proxy statement in connection with its 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "2023 Proxy Statement"), which was filed with the SEC on <span>May 17, 2023</span> (and is available at&nbsp;<a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.sec.gov_ix-3Fdoc-3D_Archives_edgar_data_1720671_000114036123025250_ny20008192x1-5Fdef14a.htm&amp;d=DwMGaQ&amp;c=BSDicqBQBDjDI9RkVyTcHQ&amp;r=W9dONwI1yR8TY6fdJkjNwdlDQU2ROvWbv1mlvkWQFLs&amp;m=WIP1VyxuvBGNlzTUaYuNxHpbet03ywNI-NapdbhVOxO7G4LhtR2egnoPZFg5wgFk&amp;s=DAxP0uH2PZLVIrXRiK8JS2ywGdYGNx-kvMHxAEWkP_4&amp;e=" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1720671/000114036123025250/ny20008192x1_def14a.htm</a>).

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p id="speakable-summary">AI is supercharging coding — and developers are embracing it.</p>
<p>In a recent StackOverflow poll, 44% of software engineers said that they <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/06/14/hype-or-not-developers-have-something-to-say-about-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">use AI tools as part of their development processes</a> now and 26% plan to soon. Gartner <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-04-11-gartner-says-75-percent-of-enterprise-software-engineers-will-use-ai-code-assistants-by-2028" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimates</a> that over half of organizations are currently piloting or have already deployed AI-driven coding assistants, and that 75% of developers will use coding assistants in some form by 2028.</p>
<p>Ex-Microsoft software developer Igor Ostrovsky <span>believes that soon, there won’t be a developer who </span><em>doesn’</em><em>t&nbsp;</em><span>use AI in their workflows.&nbsp;</span>“Software engineering remains a difficult and all-too-often tedious and frustrating job, particularly at scale,” he told TechCrunch. “AI can improve software quality, team productivity and help restore the joy of programming.”</p>
<p>So Ostrovsky <span>decided to build the AI-powered coding platform that he himself would want to use.</span></p>
<p>That platform is <a href="https://www.augmentcode.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Augment</a>, and on Wednesday it <a href="https://www.augmentcode.com/blog/augment-inc-raises-227-million">emerged</a> from stealth with $252 million in funding at a near-unicorn ($977 million) post-money valuation. With investments from former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and VCs including Index Ventures, Sutter Hill Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Innovation Endeavors and Meritech Capital, Augment aims to shake up the still-nascent market for generative AI coding technologies.</p>
<p>“Most companies are dissatisfied with the programs they produce and consume; software is too often fragile, complex and expensive to maintain with development teams bogged down with long backlogs for feature requests, bug fixes, security patches, integration requests, migrations and upgrades,” Ostrovsky said. “Augment has both the best team and recipe for empowering programmers and their organizations to deliver high-quality software quicker.”</p>
<p>Ostrovsky spent nearly seven years at Microsoft before joining Pure Storage, a startup developing flash data storage hardware and software products, as a founding engineer. While at Microsoft, Ostrovsky worked on components of Midori, a next-generation operating system the company never released but whose concepts have made their way into other Microsoft projects over the last decade.</p>
<p>In 2022, Ostrovsky and Guy Gur-Ari, previously an AI research scientist at Google, teamed up to create Augment’s MVP. To fill out the startup’s executive ranks, Ostrovsky and Gur-Ari brought on Scott Dietzen, ex-CEO of Pure Storage, and Dion Almaer, formerly a Google engineering director and a VP of engineering at Shopify.</p>
<p>Augment remains a strangely hush-hush operation.</p>
<p>In our conversation, Ostrovsky wasn’t willing to say much about the user experience or even the generative AI models driving Augment’s features (whatever they may be) — save that Augment is using fine-tuned “industry-leading” open models of some sort.</p>
<p>He did say how Augment plans to make money: standard software-as-a-service subscriptions. Pricing and other details will be revealed later this year, Ostrovsky added, closer to Augment’s planned GA release.</p>
<p>“Our funding provides many years of runway to continue to build what we believe to be the best team in enterprise AI,” he said. “We’re accelerating product development and building out Augment’s product, engineering and go-to-market functions as the company gears up for rapid growth.”</p>
<p>Rapid growth is perhaps the best shot Augment has at making waves in an increasingly cutthroat industry.</p>
<p>Practically every tech giant offers its own version of an AI coding assistant. Microsoft has GitHub Copilot, which is by far the firmest entrenched with over 1.3 million paying individual and 50,000 enterprise customers as of February. Amazon has AWS’ CodeWhisperer. And Google has Gemini Code Assist, recently rebranded from Duet AI for Developers.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, there’s a torrent of coding assistant startups: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/06/magic-dev-code-generating-startup-raises-23m/" data-mrf-link="https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/06/magic-dev-code-generating-startup-raises-23m/">Magic</a><span>,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/08/code-generating-ai-platform-tabnine-nabs-25m-investment/" data-mrf-link="https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/08/code-generating-ai-platform-tabnine-nabs-25m-investment/">Tabnine</a><span>,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/16/codegen-raises-new-capital-llm-automation-for-software-dev/" data-mrf-link="https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/16/codegen-raises-new-capital-llm-automation-for-software-dev/">Codegen</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/29/refact-launches-to-make-code-generating-ai-more-appealing-to-enterprises/">Refact</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/10/tabbyml-github-copilot-alternative-raises-3-2-million/">TabbyML</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/02/sweep-aims-to-automate-basic-dev-tasks-using-large-language-models/">Sweep</a>,<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/12/laredo-wants-to-use-gen-ai-to-automate-dev-work/" data-mrf-link="https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/12/laredo-wants-to-use-gen-ai-to-automate-dev-work/">Laredo</a> and <span>Cognition (which <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/six-month-old-ai-coding-startup-valued-at-2-billion-by-founders-fund?offer=rtsu-engagement-24&amp;utm_campaign=RTSU+-+Cognition%2FFou&amp;utm_content=3915&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=cio&amp;utm_term=2713" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly</a> just raised $175 million), </span>to name a few. <span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/21/harness-releases-generative-ai-assistant-to-help-ease-developer-workloads/">Harness</a></span> and <span>JetBrains, which developed the Kotlin programming language, recently </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/07/as-a-new-ai-driven-coding-assistant-is-launched-the-battle-for-ai-mindshare-moves-to-developers/">released</a><span> their <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/07/as-a-new-ai-driven-coding-assistant-is-launched-the-battle-for-ai-mindshare-moves-to-developers/">own</a>. So did&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/20/sentrys-ai-powered-autofix-helps-developers-quickly-debug-and-fix-their-production-code/">Sentry</a> (albeit with more of a cybersecurity bent).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Can they all — plus Augment now — do business harmoniously together? It seems unlikely. Eye-watering compute costs alone make the AI coding assistant business a challenging one to maintain. Overruns related to training and serving models forced generative AI coding startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/10/with-kites-demise-can-generative-ai-for-code-succeed/" data-mrf-link="https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/10/with-kites-demise-can-generative-ai-for-code-succeed/">Kite</a> to shut down in December 2022. <a href="https://aibusiness.com/nlp/github-copilot-loses-20-a-month-per-user" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Even Copilot loses money</a>, to the tune of around $20 to $80 a month per user, according to The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p>Ostrovsky implies that there’s momentum behind Augment already; he claims that “h<span>undreds” of software developers across “dozens” of companies, including payment startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/06/eric-schmidt-keeta-cross-border-payments-fintech/">Keeta</a> (which is also Eric Schmidt-backed), are using Augment in early access. But will the uptake sustain? That’s the million-dollar question, indeed.</span></p>
<p>I also wonder if Augment has made any steps toward solving the technical setbacks plaguing code-generating AI, particularly around vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>An analysis by GitClear, the developer of the code analytics tool of the same name, <a href="https://visualstudiomagazine.com/Articles/2024/01/25/copilot-research.aspx">found</a> that coding assistants are resulting in more mistaken code being pushed to codebases, creating headaches for software maintainers. Security researchers have warned that generative coding tools can <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/news/366571117/GitHub-Copilot-replicating-vulnerabilities-insecure-code" target="_blank" rel="noopener">amplify</a> existing bugs and exploits in projects. And Stanford researchers have <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/12/21/ai_assistants_bad_code/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found</a> that developers who accept code recommendations from AI assistants tend to produce less secure code.</p>
<p>Then there’s copyright to worry about.</p>
<p>Augment’s models were undoubtedly trained on publicly available data, like all generative AI models — some of which may’ve been copyrighted or under a restrictive license. Some vendors have argued that <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/#:~:text=Fair%20use%20is%20a%20legal,protected%20works%20in%20certain%20circumstances." target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-mrf-link="https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/#:~:text=Fair%20use%20is%20a%20legal,protected%20works%20in%20certain%20circumstances.">fair use doctrine</a> shields them from copyright claims while at the same time rolling out tools to mitigate potential infringement. But that hasn’t stopped coders from <a href="https://www.finnegan.com/en/insights/articles/insights-from-the-pending-copilot-class-action-lawsuit.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-mrf-link="https://www.finnegan.com/en/insights/articles/insights-from-the-pending-copilot-class-action-lawsuit.html">filing</a> class action lawsuits over what they allege are open licensing and IP violations.</p>
<p>To all this, Ostrovsky says: “Current AI coding assistants don’t adequately understand the programmer’s intent, improve software quality nor facilitate team productivity, and they don’t properly protect intellectual property. Augment’s engineering team boasts deep AI and systems expertise. We’re poised to bring AI coding assistance innovations to developers and software teams.”</p>
<p>Augment, which is based in Palo Alto, has around 50 employees; Ostrovsky expects that number to double by the end of the year.</p>
