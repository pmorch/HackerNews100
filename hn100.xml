			<h2>Impact of Osteoarthritis</h2>
		<p><span>Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that is the most common type of arthritis. It gradually worsens over time as cartilage, the specialized connective tissue that covers the ends of bones, wears down, leading to pain, stiffness, and loss of mobility. Osteoarthritis is already the third most common type of disability and has an estimated economic burden of more than $136 billion per year. </span><span>It disproportionately affects women, the elderly, certain racial/ethnic minorities, and those with lower socioeconomic status. </span><span>The prevalence of knee osteoarthritis has been rising due to aging of the population, increasing rates of joint injury, and, significantly, obesity.</span></p>

<p><span>The clinical gold standard treatment for knee joints ravaged by pervasive OA or traumatic injury is a total joint replacement using prosthetic implants made of metal and plastic. Although knee replacement is widely successful, there are some major drawbacks to these conventional materials. There can be life-changing complications and limitations of current artificial knee replacements, including infection, loosening, hardware failure, stiffness, abnormal kinematics (i.e., the way a knee moves), instability, and persistent pain. Historically, knee replacements have had a limited lifespan with a portion failing at 15 to 20 years due to plastic wear or implant loosening. This means that younger patients may need one or even two revision implants. The demand for total knee replacements is projected to grow by 673% -- 3.48 million procedures from 2005 to 2030 -- with total knee revisions projected to grow 601% between 2005 to 2030.&nbsp;</span></p>
</section>
<section about="" typeof="">
			<h2>NOVAJoint — a living solution to ravaged knees</h2>
		<p><span>With the ARPA-H award, the researchers propose to design NOVAJoint to address the urgent, unmet clinical need for a permanent solution for patients with advanced OA where a conventional knee replacement is indicated. The project’s goal is to develop a replacement knee of regenerated living cartilage and bone that integrates seamlessly with the native bone and restores pain-free joint function. Since cells are required to regenerate and maintain this living implant, the team will create two versions of NOVAJoint: a version that uses patient’s own cells and one that uses donor cells. The researchers expect NOVAJoint to substantially extend the implant life, reducing complications, and to become a permanent and final procedure for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee.&nbsp; With an aggressive timeline, in the first two years, the team will create the first prototypes before moving into preclinical and clinical studies in the final three years, including a Phase 1 safety clinical trial in the final year.</span></p>

<p><span>Though the first NOVAJoint is still in development, many of the technologies and scientific discoveries necessary to create the joint have already been developed and validated by Columbia researchers through funding from the National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation, Department of Defense, and institutional support.</span></p>

<p><span>“The ARPA-H NITRO program has enabled us to leverage our innovative technologies and expertise to solve one of the most difficult challenges in biomedical engineering,” said Hung, a groundbreaking researcher in musculoskeletal regeneration.</span></p>
</section>
<section about="" typeof="">
			<h2>The Collaborators</h2>
		<p><span>The NOVAJoint team will fabricate a living knee replacement using modern manufacturing techniques and capitalizes on the critical mass of musculoskeletal researchers at Columbia with collective expertise in biomechanics, biomaterials, stem cells, and orthopedic surgery from across the School of Engineering and Applied Science, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons and College of Dental Medicine, building on a decades-long history of collaboration between the Departments of Orthopedic Surgery and Biomedical Engineering. The project team is multidisciplinary, with scientific leadership from faculty in the Departments of Biomedical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Orthopedic Surgery, and Dental Medicine. Co-PIs and Task Leads include Treena Arinzeh, Professor of Biomedical Engineering; Gerard Ateshian, Andrew Walz Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Professor of Biomedical Engineering;&nbsp; Alice Huang, Associate Professor of Bioengineering (in Orthopedic Surgery); and Roshan Shah, Russell A. Hibbs Associate Professor of Orthopedics (in Orthopedic Surgery) and Director of Complex Reconstruction; Chang Lee, Associate Professor of Craniofacial Engineering (in Dental Medicine).</span></p>

<p><span>Working with the Columbia team is James L. Cook, William &amp; Kathryn Allen Distinguished Chair in Orthopaedic Surgery, University of Missouri, who will lead preclinical testing. Drs. Cook and Shah will also lead the clinical trial, which will be recruiting patients at both universities. The team is partnering with New York Stem Cell Foundation and New York Blood Center for GMP manufacturing of NOVAJoint.</span></p>

<p><span>“This is a big challenge, but by creating a large and experienced team that works well together and can be focused on one goal, we expect to succeed,” said Chahine, a leader in orthopedic research. “NOVAJoint will mark a major milestone in the field of regenerative medicine and orthopedic surgery, and has the potential to revolutionize musculoskeletal treatments of the many joints that degenerate with age or injury.”</span></p>
</section>
<section about="" typeof="">
			<h2>Equity and Commercialization</h2>
		<p><span>In addition to the advancement in science, equity and commercialization are key pillars to the programmatic success of this project. Part of NITRO’s vision is to establish a clear path to commercialization, which is a prerequisite for successful clinical translation and impact of disruptive technologies such as NOVAJoint. ARPA-H has a firm commitment to equitable healthcare access for all, irrespective of race, ethnicity, gender/gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, geography, employment, insurance, and socioeconomic status.</span></p>

<p><span>“Our goal is to push knee replacement to its next stage of evolution and to create a better solution to osteoarthritis for all Americans. Every day patients ask me about new advancements in knee replacement surgery, hoping for validation of their years of suffering before seeking care,” says Dr. Shah.&nbsp; “Now I have something to tell them. I think the big orthopedic companies will be watching this project closely, and will be vying for the chance to commercialize NOVAJoint nationally.”</span></p>

<p><span>In order to meet these programmatic goals, the team will also be leveraging the expertise and resources of the</span><a href="https://www.irvinginstitute.columbia.edu/" rel="nofollow"> <span>Irving Institute for Clinical and Translational Research</span></a><span> and</span><a href="https://techventures.columbia.edu/" rel="nofollow"> <span>Columbia Technology Ventures</span></a><span>. The NOVAJoint team will include a full-time Equity Officer who will help develop key equity performance indicators. The equity officer will work closely with </span><span>Rachel C. Shelton</span><span>, Associate Professor of Sociomedical Sciences at Mailman School of Public Health and co-director of the Irving Institute’s</span><a href="https://www.irvinginstitute.columbia.edu/about-us/resources-and-cores/community-engagement-core-resource-cecr" rel="nofollow"> <span>Community Engagement Core Resource</span></a><span> (CECR) and Lisa Royse, Department of Orthopedic Surgery, University of Missouri, to foster research conducted in partnership with community stakeholders to better inform the application of scientific findings to clinical and community settings.</span></p>

<p>In the small Appalachian city of Bristol, Virginia, City Council member Neal Osborne left a meeting on the morning of Jan. 3 and rushed himself to the hospital.</p>







<p>Osborne, 36, has Type 1 diabetes. His insulin pump had malfunctioned, and without a steady supply of this essential hormone, Osborne’s blood sugar skyrocketed and his body was shutting down.</p>



<p>Osborne went to the nearest hospital, Bristol Regional Medical Center. He said he settled into a wheelchair in the emergency room waiting area, where over the next few hours he drifted in and out of consciousness and retched up vomit, then bile, then blood. After 12 hours in the waiting room, Osborne said, he was moved to an ER bed, where he stayed until he was sent to the intensive care unit the next day. In total, the council member was in the ER for about 30 hours, he said.</p>



<p>Osborne said his ordeal echoes stories he’s heard from constituents for years. In his next crisis, Osborne said, he plans to leave Bristol for an ER about two hours away.</p>



<p>“I want to go to Knoxville or I want to go to Roanoke, because I do not want to further risk my life and die at a Ballad hospital,” he said. “The wait times just to get in and see a doctor in the ER have grown exponentially.”</p>



<p>Ballad Health, a 20-hospital system in the Tri-Cities region of Tennessee and Virginia, benefits from the <a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/appalachia-ballad-health-copa-monopoly-charity-care-quality/">largest state-sanctioned hospital monopoly</a> in the United States. In the six years since lawmakers in both states waived anti-monopoly laws and Ballad was formed, ER visits for patients sick enough to be hospitalized grew more than three times as long and now far exceed the criteria set by state officials, according to <a href="https://www.tn.gov/content/tn/health/health-program-areas/health-planning/certificate-of-public-advantage/redir-copa/copa-reports.html">Ballad reports</a> released by the Tennessee Department of Health.</p>












<p>Tennessee and Virginia have so far announced no steps to reduce time spent in Ballad ERs. The Tennessee health department, which has a more direct role in regulating Ballad, has each year issued a report saying the agreement that gave Ballad a monopoly “continues to provide a Public Advantage.” Department officials have twice declined to comment to KFF Health News on Ballad’s performance.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24480905-ballad_health_fy23_copa_reports">Ballad’s latest annual report</a>, which was released this month and spans from July 2022 to June 2023, the median time that patients spend in Ballad ERs before being admitted to the hospital is nearly 11 hours. This statistic includes both time spent waiting and time being treated in the ER and excludes patients who weren’t admitted or left the ER without receiving care.</p>



<p>The federal government once tracked ER speed the same way. When compared against the latest <a href="https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/archived-data/hospitals">corresponding federal data</a> from 2019, which includes more than 4,000 hospitals but predates the covid-19 pandemic, Ballad ranks among the 100 hospitals with the slowest ERs. More current federal data is not available because the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services retired this statistic in 2020 in favor of other measurements.</p>



<p>Newer data tells a similar story. The Joint Commission, a nonprofit that accredits health care organizations, collected this same measurement for 2022 from about 250 hospitals that volunteered the data, finding a median ER speed of five hours and 41 minutes — or about five hours faster than Ballad’s latest annual report.</p>



<p>Ballad Health spokesperson Molly Luton said in an email statement that, by holding patients in the ER, where they are observed while waiting for a bed, Ballad avoids “overwhelming” its staff. Luton said ER delays are also caused by two nationwide crises: a nursing shortage and fewer admissions at nursing homes and similar facilities, which can create a backlog of patients awaiting discharge from the hospital.</p>



<p>Luton added that Ballad’s ER time for admitted patients has dropped to about 7½ hours in the months since the company’s latest annual report.</p>



<p>“On those issues Ballad Health can directly control, our performance has rebounded from 2022, and is now among the best in the nation,” Luton said.</p>



<p>Luton also noted that Ballad performs better than or close to the national average on several other measurements of ER performance, including having fewer patients who leave without being treated. CMS data shows the national average is about 3%. Ballad reported 1.4% in its latest annual report.</p>



<p>Osborne, the Bristol council member, attributed this statistic to Ballad’s monopoly.</p>



<p>“Just because they aren’t leaving the ER doesn’t mean they are happy where they are,” he said. “It just means they don’t have anywhere else they could be.”</p>

<p><strong>Ballad’s Big Monopoly</strong><strong></strong></p>



<p>Ballad Health was formed in 2018 after state officials approved the nation’s biggest hospital merger based on a so-called Certificate of Public Advantage, or COPA, agreement. COPAs have been used in about 10 hospital mergers over the past three decades, but none has involved as many hospitals as Ballad’s.</p>



<p>State lawmakers in Tennessee and Virginia waived federal anti-monopoly laws so rival hospital systems — Mountain States Health Alliance and Wellmont Health System — could merge into a single company with no competition. Ballad is now the only option for hospital care for most of about 1.1 million residents in a 29-county region at the nexus of Tennessee, Virginia, Kentucky, and North Carolina.</p>



<p>The Federal Trade Commission warns that hospital monopolies lead to increased prices and decreased quality of care. To offset the perils of Ballad’s monopoly, officials required the new company to commit to a long list of special conditions, including dozens of quality-care metrics spelled out with specific benchmarks.</p>



<p>In its latest annual report, Ballad improved on many quality-of-care metrics over the prior year, including several that the company prioritized, but still fell short on 56 of 75 benchmarks.</p>



<p>ER time for admitted patients is one of those. The benchmark was set at three hours and 47 minutes in the original COPA agreement. Ballad met or nearly met this goal for three years, according to its annual reports. Then the ERs slowed.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24480925-fy21-ballad-health-copa-annual-report">2022</a>, Ballad reported a median ER time for admitted patients of about six hours.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24480923-ballad-health-fy22-copa">2023</a>, it reported the same statistic at seven hours and 40 minutes.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24480905-ballad_health_fy23_copa_reports">the latest report</a>, ER time for admitted patients had reached 10 hours and 45 minutes.</p>



<p>CMS, which grades thousands of hospitals nationwide, <a href="https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/topics/hospitals/timely-effective-care#emergency-department-care">warns on its website</a> that timely ER care is “essential for good patient outcomes,” and that more time spent in the ER has been linked to higher complication rates and delays in patients getting pain medication and antibiotics.</p>



<p>Ben Harder, chief of health analysis for U.S. News &amp; World Report, said extensive ER times can be a symptom of slowdowns throughout a hospital, including in the operating room.</p>



<p>“A long delay in getting patients admitted is both a risk in itself, in that a test may not get conducted as promptly,” Harder said. “But it’s also an indication that the hospital is backed up, and that there are problems getting patients moved from one unit to another.”</p>



<p>Bill Christian, a spokesperson for the Tennessee Department of Health, said Ballad’s rising ER times had been “noted” but did not say if the agency had taken or was considering any action. Christian directed questions about Ballad’s latest stats to the company itself.</p>



<p><strong>‘A Nightmare for Community Members’</strong></p>



<p>Ballad has also fallen short — by about $191 million over the past five years — of its obligation to Tennessee to provide charity care, which is free or discounted care for low-income patients, according to health department documents and Ballad’s latest report. The health department <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23929508-ballad-health-charity-care-waiver-letters">waived this obligation</a> in each of the past four fiscal years. Ballad has said it would ask for another this year.</p>



<p>In a two-hour interview last year, Ballad CEO Alan Levine defended his company and said that because the Tri-Cities region could not support two competing hospital companies, the COPA merger had likely prevented at least three hospital closures. Levine attributed Ballad’s failure to meet quality benchmarks to the pressure of the covid pandemic and said charity care shortfalls were partly caused by Medicaid changes beyond Ballad’s control.</p>



<p>“Our critics say, ‘No Ballad. We don’t want Ballad.’ Well, then what?” Levine said. “Because the hospitals were on their way to being closed.”</p>



<p>Some residents see Ballad as a savior. John King, who runs a physical therapy clinic in the core of Ballad’s region, said at a <a href="https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/health/documents/copa/COPA-meeting-TRANSCRIPT-6-12-23.pdf">public hearing last June</a> that in multiple visits to Ballad ERs, including one for a stroke, he found their care to be quick and compassionate.</p>



<p>“If it weren’t for Ballad Health, I literally would not be here today,” King said, according to a hearing transcript.</p>



<p>Ballad’s failures to live up to the terms of the COPA agreement were detailed in a <a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/appalachia-ballad-health-copa-monopoly-charity-care-quality/">KFF Health News investigation</a> last September, and the company faced a new wave of criticism in the months that followed.</p>



<p>Local leaders in Carter County, Tennessee, in October debated but did not pass a resolution calling for Ballad to be better regulated or broken up. Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti, a Republican, said in an <a href="https://tennesseelookout.com/2023/11/06/tenn-attorney-general-urges-close-look-at-ballad-health-operations-amid-community-concerns-over-monopoly-deal/">interview with the Tennessee Lookout</a> published in November that Ballad must be constantly monitored in light of community complaints. Earlier this month, Tennessee state Rep. David Hawk (R-Greeneville), who represents a region within Ballad’s monopoly, called for Levine’s resignation, according to wjhl.com.</p>



<p>In response, Ballad Health said in a statement it has “strong relationships with the majority of elected officials” in Carter County and welcomed scrutiny from the Tennessee attorney general. Ballad said Hawk’s “opinion certainly does not reflect our broader relationships” within the area. Tennessee lawmakers are also considering legislation to <a href="https://wapp.capitol.tn.gov/apps/BillInfo/Default.aspx?BillNumber=HB2600&amp;ga=113">forbid future COPA mergers</a> in the state, which Ballad said “risks putting more hospitals at risk for closure.”</p>



<p>The bill was introduced by state Sen. Heidi Campbell (D-Nashville) and state Rep. Gloria Johnson (D-Knoxville), who is running for the U.S. Senate. Johnson said the bill would end Ballad’s protection from antitrust laws.</p>



<p>“It’s just been a nightmare for community members out there,” Johnson said. “And they have no other option.”</p>

It's also why there is no free plan in the pricing.<p>In terms of convincing, for the technically-minded, I have a public disaster recovery plan, a public business continuity plan, and "escape hatches" for "common" events -- war, subpoenas, changes in law, a post-RSA future, etc. The goal is to cover as many events as possible, including the very improbable (like AWS losing a whole AZ!). The backing clouds are Microsoft Files and AWS S3, both with excellent track records and absurdly good durability. There is some special caching in front to minimize cost.</p><p>For the less technically-minded, there are no good alternatives. Self-hosted data is difficult to geographically distribute (and if you do it's difficult to update true cold storage). Cloud services have a very high lifetime cost, and unclear rules around data distribution to next of kin. Other methods, like burying some vacuum sealed MDISCs in a freezer, are not realistic.</p><p>I am of the opinion that while it is impossible to predict the future, it is possible to plan for it.

We provide automatic report options that also incur small charges, mostly to cover additional compute, hosting, and higher-tier integration with data providers. These reports can use transient data and/or pass encrypted payloads to client side report generation or display, e.g., SPA or CLI tools.

After trading them successfully with my own capital for more than a year, I launched <a href="https://grizzlybulls.com/" rel="nofollow">https://grizzlybulls.com</a> as an alternative to the traditional hedge fund monetization path.<p>Since launching in January 2022, we've significantly outperformed the market with lower volatility and reduced max drawdown:</p><p>Model - Return - Max drawdown</p><p>S&amp;P 500 (benchmark):       +9.91%      -27.56%</p><p>Platinum:              +45.34%      -16.48%</p><p>Gold:                      +39.53%      -19.12%</p><p>Silver:                      +17.24%      -22.96%</p><p>Bronze:                      +14.12%      -23.93%</p><p>Vix Basic:               +9.81%      -24.23%</p><p>TA - Mean Reversion:      +17.77%      -19.92%</p><p>TA - Trend:              +17.29%      -24.98%</p><p>This is an unleveraged, apples to apples comparison. These are not high frequency trading models. Most of them only make a trade every 2-4 weeks on average. During long signals, the models are simply long the S&amp;P 500 and during short signals, they go to cash. This can be implemented very tax efficiently by holding a core ETF long position that never gets sold and then selling S&amp;P 500 futures (ES or MES) of equal value to the ETFs against the long position. This way your account will accumulate unrealized capital gains indefinitely and you'll only pay tax on the net result of successful hedging. The cherry on top is that the S&amp;P 500 futures are section 1256 contracts that are taxed at 60% long term / 40% short term capital gains rates regardless of the duration they are held.</p><p>The models use a variety of indicators, many of them custom built. Most important are various VIX metrics (absolute level, VIX futures curve shape/slope, divergences against S&amp;P 500 price, etc), trend-following TA metrics (MACD, EMV, etc), mean-reversion TA metrics (Bollinger Bands, CMO, etc), macroeconomic (unemployment, housing starts, leading composite), and monetary policy (yield curve inversion, equity risk premium, dot plot, etc). They've been backtested very cautiously to avoid overfitting.

You can design another template like Supplements with metrics for specific dosages, for example. Your history can be visualized and those metrics can be correlated shortly after.</p><p>Every time you fill out an entry you have the option of adding notes, which can serve as a diary functionality. Those notes are searchable in your history.</p><p>Let us know any other feedback you have, we’d really like to make this as usable as possible.

After 1 year, customers are, in a way, forced to create a new emergency note, and at the same time, they can verify if anything is going to change soon on the platform (e.g. upcoming shutdown).

    <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Hey HN! We’re Jack and Finn from Aqua Voice (<a href="https://www.withaqua.com/">https://www.withaqua.com/</a>). Aqua is a voice-native document editor that combines reliable dictation and natural language commands, letting you say things like: “make this a list” or “it’s Erin with an E” or “add an inline citation here for page 86 of this book”. Here is a demo: <a href="https://youtu.be/qwSAKg1YafM" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/qwSAKg1YafM</a>.</p><p>Finn, who is big-time dyslexic, has been using dictation software since the sixth grade when his dad set him up on Dragon Dictation. He used it through school to write papers, and has been keeping his own transcription benchmarks since college. All that time, writing with your voice has remained a cumbersome and brittle experience that is riddled with painpoints.</p><p>Dictation software is still terrible. All the solutions basically compete on accuracy (i.e. speech recognition), but none of them deal with the fundamentally brittle nature of the text that they generate. They don't try to format text correctly and require you to learn a bunch of specialized commands, which often are not worth it. They're not even close to a voice replacement for a keyboard.</p><p>Even post LLM, you are limited to a set of specific commands and the most accurate models don’t have any commands. Outside of these rules, the models have no sense for what is an instruction and what is content. You can’t say “and format this like an email” or “make the last bullet point shorter”. Aqua solves this.</p><p>This problem is important to Finn and millions of other people who would write with their voice if they could. Initially, we didn't think of it as a startup project. It was just something we wanted for ourselves. We thought maybe we'd write a novel with it - or something. After friends started asking to use the early versions of Aqua, it occurred to us that, if we didn't build it, maybe nobody would.</p><p>Aqua Voice is a text editor that you talk to like a person. Depending on the way that you say it and the context in which you're operating, Aqua decides whether to transcribe what you said verbatim, execute a command, or subtly modify what you said into what you meant to write.</p><p>For example, if you were to dictate: "Gryphons have classic forms resembling shield volcanoes," Aqua would output your text verbatim. But if you stumble over your words or start a sentence over a few times, Aqua is smart enough to figure that out and to only take the last version of the sentence.</p><p>The vision is not only to provide a more natural dictation experience, but to enable for the first time an AI-writing experience that feels natural and collaborative. This requires moving away from using LLMs for one-off chat requests and towards something that is more like streaming where you are in constant contact with the model. Voice is the natural medium for this.</p><p>Aqua is actually 6 models working together to transcribe, interpret, and rewrite the document according to your intent. Technically, executing a real-time voice application with a language model at its core requires complex coordination between multiple pieces. We use MoE transcription to outperform what was previously thought possible in terms of real-time accuracy. Then we sync up with a language model to determine what should be on the screen as quickly as possible.</p><p>The model isn't perfect, but it is ready for early adopters and we’ve already been getting feedback from grateful users. For example, a historian with carpal tunnel sent us an email he wrote using Aqua and said that he is now able to be five times as productive as he was previously. We've heard from other people with disabilities that prevent them from typing. We've also seen good adoption from people who are dyslexic or simply prefer talking to typing. It’s being used for everything from emails to brainstorming to papers to legal briefings.</p><p>While there is much left to do in terms of latency and robustness, the best experiences with Aqua are beginning to feel magical. We would love for you to try it out and give us feedback, which you can do with no account on <a href="https://withaqua.com/">https://withaqua.com</a>. If you find it useful, it’s $10/month after a 1000-token free trial. (We want to bump the free trial in the future, but we're a small team, and running this thing isn’t cheap.)</p><p>We’d love to hear your ideas and comments with voice-to-text!</p></div></td></tr>        <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><form action="comment" method="post"></form></td></tr>  </tbody></table>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Affected versions</h2><a id="user-content-affected-versions" aria-label="Permalink: Affected versions" href="#affected-versions"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The exploit affects versions from (including) v5.14 to (including) v6.6, excluding patched branches v5.15.149&gt;, v6.1.76&gt;, v6.6.15&gt;. The patch for these versions were released in feb 2024. The underlying vulnerability affects all versions (excluding patched stable branches) from v3.15 to v6.8-rc1.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Caveats:</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The exploit does not work v6.4&gt; kernels with kconfig <code>CONFIG_INIT_ON_ALLOC_DEFAULT_ON=y</code> (including Ubuntu v6.5)</li>
<li>The exploits requires user namespaces (kconfig <code>CONFIG_USER_NS=y</code>), that those user namespaces are unprivileged (sh command <code>sysctl kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone</code> = 1), and that nf_tables is enabled (kconfig <code>CONFIG_NF_TABLES=y</code>). By default, these are all enabled on Debian, Ubuntu, and KernelCTF. Other distro's have not been tested, but may work as well.</li>
<li>The exploit may be unstable on systems with a lot of network activity
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Systems with WiFi adapter, when surrounded by high-usage WiFi networks, will be very unstable.</li>
<li>On test devices, please turn off WiFi adapters through BIOS.</li>

A reimagining that is faster paced and makes use of modern features like&nbsp;global illumination,&nbsp;volumetric fog and shadows while staying true to the game's original concepts.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that players enjoy this as much as I enjoyed the original.</p></div>

Among these is the 1986 game "The Sentinel", published as "The Senty" in the USA.</p>
<p>Developed by Geoff Crammond, a British game designer renowned for his work on the Grand Prix series, The Sentinel pushed the boundaries of what was possible on home computers at the time, offering a unique blend of strategy, atmosphere and tension that captivated players and critics alike.</p>
<p>For its time, The Sentinel was a revolutionary game. It was one of the first games to use solid 3D polygon graphics on home computers, a significant leap forward in an era when most games were text based, using 2D sprites.</p>
<p>Geoff developed a technique where rather than rendering a complete view in real time - impossible on&nbsp;8-bit hardware - the camera would rotate a number of degrees at set intervals. The edge portion of the screen would be rendered as it came into view.</p>
<p>This mechanic was built into the game play and for the first time on home computers allowed for a truly immersive 3D gaming experience.</p></div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
  

  
  <p>written on Tuesday, March 26, 2024
  

  </p><p>You're probably familiar with tech debt.  There is a joke that if there is
tech debt, surely there must be derivatives to work with that debt?  I'm
happy to say that the Rust ecosystem has created an environment where it
looks like one solution for tech debt is collateralization.</p>
<p>Here is how this miracle works.  Say you have a library <a href="https://github.com/mitsuhiko/insta">stuff</a> which depends on some other
library <a href="https://github.com/chyh1990/yaml-rust">learned-rust-this-way</a>.
The author of <cite>learned-rust-this-way</cite> at one point lost interest in this
thing and issues keep piling up.  Some of those issues are feature
requests, others are legitimate bugs.  However you as the person that
wrote <cite>stuff</cite> never ran into any of those problems.  Yet it's hard to
argue that <cite>learned-rust-this-way</cite> isn't tech debt.  It's one that does
not bother you all that much, but it's debt nonetheless.</p>
<p>At one point someone else figures out that <cite>learned-rust-this-way</cite> is debt.
One of the ways in which this happens is because the name is great.
Clearly that's not the only person that learned Rust this way and someone
else also wants that name.  Except the original author is unreachable.  So
now there is one more reason for that package <a href="https://github.com/rustsec/advisory-db/issues/1921">to get added to the RUSTSEC
database</a> and all
the sudden all hell breaks lose.  Within minutes CI will start failing for
a lot of people that directly or indirectly use <cite>learned-rust-this-way</cite>
notifying them that something happened.  That's because <cite>RUSTSEC</cite> is
basically a rating agency and they decided that your debt is now junk.</p>
<p>What happens next?  As the maintainer of <cite>stuff</cite> your users all the sudden
start calling you out for using <cite>learned-rust-this-way</cite> and you suffer.
Stress levels increase.  You gotta unload that shit.  Why?  Not because it
does not work for you, but someone called you out of that debt.  If we
really want to stress the financial terms this is your margin call.  Your
users demand action to deal with your debt.</p>
<p>So what can you do?  One option is to move to alternatives (unload the
debt).  In this particular case for whatever reason all the alternatives
to <cite>learned-rust-this-way</cite> are not looking very appealing either.  One is
a fork of that thing which also only has a single maintained, but all the
sudden pulls in 3 more dependencies, one of which already have a "B-"
rating.  Another option in the ecosystem just decided <a href="https://github.com/dtolnay/serde-yaml/commit/3ba8462f7d3b603d832e0daeb6cfc7168a673d7a">to default</a>
before they are called out.</p>
<p>Remember you never touched <cite>learned-rust-this-way</cite> actively.  It worked
for you in the unmaintained way of the last four years.  If you now fork
that library (and name it <cite>learned-rust-this-way-and-its-okay</cite>) you are
now subject to the same demands.  Forking that library is putting cash on
the pile of debt.  Except if you don't act up on the bug reports there,
you will eventually be called out like <cite>learned-rust-this-way</cite> was.  So
while that might buy you time, it does not really solve the issue.</p>
<p>However here is what actually does work: you just merge that code into
your own library.  Now that junk tech debt is suddenly rated “AAA”.  For
as long as you never touch that code any more, you never reveal to anyone
that you did that, and you just keep maintaining your library like you did
before, the world keeps spinning on.</p>
<p>So as of today: I collateralized <cite>yaml-rust</cite> by vendoring it in <cite>insta</cite>.
It's now an amalgamation of insta code and yaml-rust.  And by doing so, I
successfully upgraded this junk tech debt to a perfect AAA.</p>
<p>Who won?  I think nobody really.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Web-based design platform Canva has acquired the <a href="https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/">Affinity creative software suite</a>, positioning itself as a challenger to Adobe’s grip over the digital design industry. Canva <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.canva.com%2Fnewsroom%2Fnews%2Faffinity%2F">announced the deal on Tuesday</a>, which gives the company ownership over <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/9/23448945/affinity-version-2-adobe-creative-app-features-price">Affinity Designer, Photo, and Publisher</a> — three popular creative applications for Windows, Mac, and iPad that provide similar features to Adobe’s Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign software, respectively.</p><p>Official figures for the deal have not been revealed, but <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-26/canva-acquires-affinity-design-suite-in-push-to-rival-adobe?embedded-checkout=true"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> reports that it’s valued at “several hundred million [British] pounds.” Nevertheless, the acquisition makes sense as the Australian-based company tries to attract more creative professionals. As of <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.canva.com%2Fnewsroom%2Fnews%2Fcanva-us-growth%2F">January this year</a>, Canva’s design platform attracted around 170 million monthly global users. That’s a <em>lot </em>of people who probably aren’t using equivalent Adobe software like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/16/23834146/adobe-express-firefly-generative-ai-release-design-app">Express</a>, but unlike Adobe, Canva doesn’t have its own design applications that target creative professionals like illustrators, photographers, and video editors.&nbsp;</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="A screenshot of Affinity Designer 2 with a colorful boardwalk." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2880x1800/376x235/filters:focal(1440x900:1441x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25355743/Affinity_Designer__3_.png 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2880x1800/384x240/filters:focal(1440x900:1441x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25355743/Affinity_Designer__3_.png 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2880x1800/415x259/filters:focal(1440x900:1441x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25355743/Affinity_Designer__3_.png 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2880x1800/480x300/filters:focal(1440x900:1441x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25355743/Affinity_Designer__3_.png 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2880x1800/540x338/filters:focal(1440x900:1441x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25355743/Affinity_Designer__3_.png 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2880x1800/640x400/filters:focal(1440x900:1441x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25355743/Affinity_Designer__3_.png 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2880x1800/750x469/filters:focal(1440x900:1441x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25355743/Affinity_Designer__3_.png 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2880x1800/828x518/filters:focal(1440x900:1441x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25355743/Affinity_Designer__3_.png 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2880x1800/1080x675/filters:focal(1440x900:1441x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25355743/Affinity_Designer__3_.png 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2880x1800/1200x750/filters:focal(1440x900:1441x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25355743/Affinity_Designer__3_.png 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2880x1800/1440x900/filters:focal(1440x900:1441x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25355743/Affinity_Designer__3_.png 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2880x1800/1920x1200/filters:focal(1440x900:1441x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25355743/Affinity_Designer__3_.png 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2880x1800/2048x1280/filters:focal(1440x900:1441x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25355743/Affinity_Designer__3_.png 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2880x1800/2400x1500/filters:focal(1440x900:1441x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25355743/Affinity_Designer__3_.png 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2880x1800/2400x1500/filters:focal(1440x900:1441x901):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25355743/Affinity_Designer__3_.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><div><figcaption><em>Affinity Designer 2 (pictured) is a vector-based application similar to Adobe Illustrator.

The decision to make its Affinity applications a one-time-purchase with no ongoing subscription fees has earned it a loyal fanbase, especially with creatives who are actively looking for alternatives to Adobe’s subscription-based design ecosystem.</p><p>In an interview with the <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/technology/canva-has-designs-on-the-pros-following-its-largest-ever-acquisition-20240325-p5fezk.html"><em>Sydney Morning Herald</em></a>, Canva co-founder Cameron Adams said that Affinity applications will remain separate from Canva’s platform, but that some small integrations should be expected over time. “Our product teams have already started chatting and we have some immediate plans for lightweight integration, but we think the products themselves will always be separate,” said Adams.</p><p>With Affinity and its 90 UK-based employees now on board, Canva has more opportunities to compete with Adobe across the wider creative software market. And given how attractive Canva’s simplicity-focused platform already is to creatives, it might have a real chance of luring away professionals who are tired of filling Adobe’s pockets.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>Julian Assange has been handed a reprieve in his fight against extradition to the US after two judges ruled the WikiLeaks founder could take his case to an appeal hearing – but only if the Biden administration is unable to provide the court with suitable assurances.</p><p>The president of the king’s bench division, Victoria Sharp, and Mr Justice Johnson said Assange had real prospects of success on three of the nine grounds argued, but adjourned the leave to appeal application to give the US government three weeks to provide reassurance on the relevant matters.</p><p>If Assange had been denied permission to appeal he could have been extradited within days to face espionage charges. While the judges’ decision means he avoids that fate it leaves him facing a further wait, with his future still unresolved.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.judiciary.uk/judgments/assange-v-government-of-the-united-states-of-america-3/" data-link-name="in body link">a written judgment</a>, handed down on Tuesday morning, Sharp said the concerns that had real prospects of success at appeal but which “may be capable of being addressed by assurances” were “that the applicant [Assange] is permitted to rely on the first amendment, that the applicant is not prejudiced at trial, including sentence, by reason of his nationality, that he is afforded the same first amendment protections as a United States citizen, and that the death penalty is not imposed”.</p><p>At a two-day hearing last month, which Assange was too unwell to attend, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/feb/20/julian-assange-risks-flagrant-denial-of-justice-if-tried-in-us-london-court-told" data-link-name="in body link">his lawyers argued</a> that he faced a “flagrant denial of justice” if extradited to the US to face charges relating to the publication by Assange and WikiLeaks of thousands of classified and diplomatic documents they said had exposed torture, rendition, extrajudicial killings and war crimes.</p><p>His wife, Stella Assange, expressed dismay at the judges’ decision. “What the courts have done has been to invite a political intervention from the United States … send a letter saying ‘its all OK’,” she said. “I find this astounding.</p><p>“This case is a retribution. It is a signal to all of you that if you expose the interests that are driving war they will come after you, they will put you in prison and will try to kill you.</p><p>“The Biden administration should not issue assurances. They should drop this shameful case that should never have been brought.”</p><p>Ahead of the decision there had been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/mar/20/julian-assange-wikileaks-plea-deal" data-link-name="in body link">reports that the US government was considering a plea deal offer</a> to Assange, allowing him to admit to a misdemeanour, which would enable him to walk free from prison in the UK but his lawyers said they had been “given no indication” Washington intended to change its approach.</p><p>Sharp stated in Tuesday’s 66-page judgment that the UK home secretary’s lawyer had accepted that there was nothing in place to prevent Assange being charged in the US with an offence that carried the death penalty and it then being imposed.</p><p>She cited as evidence of such a risk “the calls for the imposition of the death penalty by leading politicians and other public figures; the fact that the [UK-US extradition] treaty does not preclude extradition for death penalty charges, and the fact that the existing assurance does not explicitly cover the death penalty”.</p><p>On free speech protections under the first amendment in the US, Sharp said: “He [Assange] contends that if he is given first amendment rights, the prosecution will be stopped. The first amendment is therefore of central importance to his defence to the extradition charge. Further, if he is convicted, he may wish to invoke the first amendment on the question of sentence. If he is not permitted to rely on the first amendment because of his status as a foreign national, he will thereby be prejudiced – potentially very greatly prejudiced – by reason of his nationality.”</p><p>The US has been given until 16 April to file its assurances. If it does not do so, leave to appeal will be granted. If it does provide assurances by that date the parties will be invited to file further written submissions on the issue of leave to appeal with another hearing provisionally listed for 20 May.</p><p>Michelle Stanistreet, the general secretary of the National Union of Journalists, welcomed the “temporary reprieve” but called on the US to pursue a plea deal.</p><p>“The conditionality around the grounds of appeal, which are contingent on the examination of US government assurances that he will not face the death penalty and has the right to free speech, mean the risks to Assange and press freedom remain stark,” she said.</p></div></div>]]></description>

Well… <em>sorta</em>. Sega enjoyed quite a success with the Mega Drive so there’s no reason to force developers to write 3D games <em>right now</em>.</p><p>Just in case developers want the extra dimension, Sega adapted some bits of the hardware to enable polygon drawing as well. Hopefully, the result didn’t get out of hand!</p><hr><h2 id="cpu">CPU</h2><p>Just like its close competitors <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation/#a-bit-of-history">drowned with options</a> during the RISC fever, Sega had to go through all the conundrums of choosing a new vendor that could bring up the next generation of games (including those with ‘3D’ capabilities). In the end, the company chose a fresh CPU whose creator was desperately looking for an adopter, the <strong>Hitachi SuperH</strong> or ‘SH’.</p><p>While initially focused on embedded applications, Hitachi’s new creation debuted modern arts such as <sup id="bibref:1"><a href="#bib:cpu-prog_manual" role="doc-biblioref">[1]</a></sup>:</p><ul><li>A <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/xbox/#tab-1-4-cisc-or-risc">load-store architecture</a>, meaning instructions don’t mix memory and register operations, resulting in a cleaner and scalable CPU design. This is one of the pillars of RISC CPUs.</li><li><strong>32-bit data bus and ALU</strong>, enabling to move and operate larger amounts of data (32-bit values) without consuming extra cycles.</li><li><strong>16 general-purpose 32-bit registers</strong>, which is double the amount of previous CPUs like the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/mega-drive-genesis/#cpu">Motorolla 68000</a>. This is another design decision derived from the RISC guidelines <sup id="bibref:2"><a href="#bib:cpu-patterson" role="doc-biblioref">[2]</a></sup>.</li><li><strong>32-bit address bus</strong>, allowing up to 4 GB of memory to be addressed (<em>farewell <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/nes/#going-beyond-existing-capabilities">mappers</a></em>).</li><li>A <strong>pipelined data path</strong> with <strong>five stages</strong>: The execution of instructions is now divided into five steps or <em>stages</em>. The CPU will queue up to five instructions and each one is allocated in one stage. This allows taking advantage of all the CPU’s resources without idling while also incrementing the number of instructions executed per unit of time.</li><li>A <strong>16-bit multiplication unit</strong>: Performs multiplications with 16-bit integers.</li></ul><p>Furthermore, the SuperH features a new instruction set called <strong>SuperH ISA</strong> which, apart from adopting a RISC design, <strong>all of its instructions are 16-bit wide</strong>. This comes as a surprise since this CPU operates 32-bit words, so you would expect instructions to have the same length. Yet, Hitachi managed to fit its ISA using half the size. Not only does this format reduce the size of programs, but since the CPU fetches instructions in 32-bit batches, <strong>two instructions can be retrieved in one cycle</strong>. Overall, this technique of compressing the instruction set helped tackle a common concern of RISC-based architectures called ‘code density’, where the latter required more instructions (therefore, more memory) to perform the same tasks as non-RISC systems.</p><p>Conversely, other drawbacks of RISC designs are still present in the SuperH, such as <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation/#delay-galore">control hazards</a>. Consequently, programs are required to include <strong>branch delay slots</strong> to avoid calculation errors. To remediate things, the SuperH features <strong>delayed branch instructions</strong> which are branch instructions pre-fitted with a delay slot.</p><h3 id="sega-is-not-satisfied">Sega is not satisfied</h3><p>Nevertheless, all of that didn’t stop Sega from expressing dissatisfaction with the end product. This was mainly due to the small 16-bit multiplier, which was seen as a bottleneck when processing larger amounts of data (a new need for 3D games). Thus, Hitachi synthesised a second revision with an extended multiplier unit and other requirements on Sega’s checklist <sup id="bibref:3"><a href="#bib:cpu-history" role="doc-biblioref">[3]</a></sup>, leading to a new CPU called <strong>SH-2</strong>.</p><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/saturn/sh2s.93e7ad76052cc0ac65d530f751c4fede4665f17d15fa22ff6d6586679b058506.jpg"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/saturn/_huba88a0028b93a412d89cfad4789263a2_175147_addfe0a24317362c6332a2050138e558.webp 500w,

So, it asked Hitachi to step up the clock frequency of the SH-2 - an impossible task once the chip is already out for manufacturing. Luckily, Hitachi had another trick up in their sleeve: <strong>multiprocessing</strong>. During the research phase of the SH, the team added minimal circuitry to allow the SH to work with other SHs within the same system at the same time. Upon hearing that, Sega decided on a two-chip configuration for the Sega Saturn. And the rest is history.</p><h3 id="the-final-product">The final product</h3><p>Having explained the origins, let’s take a look at the shipped product.</p><p>This console has not one but <strong>two Hitachi SH-2</strong> CPUs running at <strong>~28.63 MHz each</strong> <sup id="bibref:4"><a href="#bib:cpu-overview" role="doc-biblioref">[4]</a></sup>.

This can achieve some degree of parallelism, albeit both sharing the same external bus <sup id="bibref:5"><a href="#bib:cpu-dualcpu" role="doc-biblioref">[5]</a></sup> (which can lead to congestion).</p><p>Hitachi packaged different variants of the SH-2 and sold them as part of a series called ‘SH7600’.

So, to accelerate vector processing (at the cost of more complexity), the console houses an additional coprocessor, the <strong>Saturn Control Unit</strong> or ‘SCU’.</p><p>This is a chip comprised of two modules <sup id="bibref:8"><a href="#bib:cpu-scu" role="doc-biblioref">[8]</a></sup>:</p><ul><li><strong>A DMA controller</strong>: Arbitrates access to WRAM across the three main buses without the intervention of the CPUs.</li><li><strong>A DSP</strong>: Used as a fixed-point ‘geometry unit’. Compared to the SH-2, it does matrix/vectors calculations such as 3D transformations and lighting faster. However, it runs at half-speed and its instruction set is more complex.

Instead, the GPU reserves a portion of VRAM to draw a bitmap with all the computed geometry requested by the CPU, and then a video encoder picks up that region and outputs it through the video signal.<ul><li>Consequently, having this reserved ‘working space’ allows the GPU to continue manipulating the bitmap even after finishing rendering the scene, so the CPU may now offload some exhaustive tasks such as lighting and anti-aliasing to the GPU. Here is when the term <strong>graphics pipeline</strong> starts to gain momentum.</li></ul></li><li><strong>More VRAM required</strong>: The use of a frame buffer implies an increment of memory requirements (which is not a big issue anymore), the amount of RAM required for a frame buffer is proportional to the dimension of the screen and the number of colours used. As an example, with 600 KB of VRAM we can contain a frame buffer of 640x480 pixels wide with 32k colours per pixel (16 bpp).<ul><li>Additionally, programmers are free to organise their VRAM usage: Not every single bit has to be allocated for the frame buffer, so why don’t we also use it to cache textures, render other frame-buffers concurrently and add colour lookup tables to speed things up?</li></ul></li><li>The CPU incorporates <strong>vector operations</strong>: A GPU with 3D capabilities would be incomplete without a proper CPU capable of feeding the required geometry. For that reason, next-gen CPUs include a form of specialised instructions that accelerates vector calculations, these are known as <strong>Single instruction multiple data</strong> or ‘SIMD’ extension.<ul><li>In the case of the Saturn, vector operations are accelerated by the Saturn Control Unit (not by the SH-2 CPUs).</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="segas-offering">Sega’s offering</h3><p>This console includes <strong>two proprietary GPUs</strong>, each one serving different purposes while working concurrently.

In some cases, such as with <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/super-nintendo/#unique-features">Mode 7</a>, programmers can supply a rotation matrix to apply transformations over some of these areas. The Saturn, by contrast, allows defining 4-point quadrilaterals with arbitrary angles between their edges (Sega calls them ‘distorted sprites’). Then, the VDPs’ texture mapping capabilities paint the quadrilateral’s area with a texture, the latter is scaled to conform to the polygon’s shape.</p><p>In terms of operations needed with a 3D game, the CPUs and SCU are assigned to formulating a 3D world and project it in a 2D space.

This is because the format used to encode this model (glTF, an open standard for modern 3D modelling), so your modern device can render it, doesn’t support quadrangles at the time of this writing.

Unfortunately, both VDPs aren’t as coordinated as one would expect, so this effect will not work properly when these layers are found in different VDPs.</p><p>As a workaround, games can activate the ‘mesh’ property on a texture. With ‘meshed’ textures, the VDP1 sets the odd X/Y texture coordinates as ‘transparent’ (empty). Making it possible to blend other layers using the transparent pixels. Curiously enough, the mesh would appear blurred if the console was connected to the TV using the composite video signal (which was pretty much the standard back then, aside from RF) resulting in an accidental but effective way to accomplish half-transparency <sup id="bibref:14"><a href="#bib:graphics-geer" role="doc-biblioref">[14]</a></sup>.</p><p>As you may suspect, this just wasn’t viable for some games, so in the end, these had no option but to ditch half-transparency altogether… Although some studios found ingenious fixes, take a look at these two cases:</p><figure><figure><video poster="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/saturn/video_posters/daytona.81b963bc475e2178039efcfbb2fc7e8f15b891473b7a95a856d04a810b97946c.jpg" preload="none" width="640" height="424" src="https://www.copetti.org/videos/consoles/saturn/daytona.2e198ac188497880d3e590e8389d6230e514612581212f9c8d56f973fb498ef9.mp4" controls="" controllist="nodownload">

The Saturn’s ROM is often called ‘IPL’ presumably since its main job is to bootstrap the game and run the shell. However, the latter still stores some routines (called <strong>services</strong>) to manipulate the hardware (such as managing save data and power control). It even implements a ‘semaphore’! (used to synchronise operations that involve multiple processors at the same time). Hence, that part of the ROM is called <strong>System program</strong>.</p><hr><h2 id="games">Games</h2><p>Official Sega Saturn games are loaded from the <strong>2x CD-ROM reader</strong>. Its medium, the compact disc (CD), has a capacity of <strong>680 MB</strong> and Sega Saturn games follow the <strong>ISO 9660</strong> standard for storing data <sup id="bibref:20"><a href="#bib:games-format" role="doc-biblioref">[20]</a></sup>. Additionally, many games store audio tracks next to the data tracks for streaming uncompressed audio while executing the game.</p><h3 id="the-compact-disc-cd">The Compact Disc (CD)</h3><p>The CD is an optical medium where information is stored by engraving <strong>pits</strong> and <strong>lands</strong> on its polycarbonate surface <sup id="bibref:21"><a href="#bib:cpu-optical" role="doc-biblioref">[21]</a></sup>. Then, an infrared light is beamed from the reader and the reflection produced on the CD’s surface is used to read the information back.</p><p>The process of converting digital information (ones and zeroes) into pits and lands and vice versa is not simple by any means, especially since CDs must be robust enough to sustain day-to-day damage and intensive use; and reliable enough to store any kind of information without fear of data loss. Hence, as part of its specification, data is encoded using the <strong>Non-Return-to-Zero inverted</strong> (NRZi) model, meaning that the bitstream will be all zeroes until a land-to-pit or pit-to-land change is detected, at which a <code>1</code> will be appended instead.</p><p>This design works well until the reader encounters a sequence of ones (continuous pit and land changes) or long sequences of zeroes (constant pits or lands), at which the sensor will struggle to detect or keep synchronised, respectively. Thus, an additional model called <strong>Eight-to-Fourteen</strong> (ETF) modulation is applied. With this, a handful of zeroes are padded in-between the encodings, these help the sensor during the reading process.</p><p>On top of all this, further mechanisms of error detection may be added, although these are beyond the scope of this article. If you are interested in learning more, you can check out a slide presentation from RWTH Aachen University <sup id="bibref:22"><a href="#bib:cpu-optical" role="doc-biblioref">[22]</a></sup>.</p><h3 id="development">Development</h3><p>At first, Sega didn’t provide complete software libraries and development tools (in fact, the initial documentation was inaccurate) so the only way to achieve good performance was through <em>harsh</em> assembly.</p><p>Later on, Sega released complete SDKs, hardware kits and some libraries to ease I/O and graphics operations. Overall, games are written in a mix of <strong>C</strong> and various assemblies targeting individual components.</p><h3 id="io">I/O</h3><p>Peripheral management and real-time clock are also provided by the aforementioned <strong>System Management &amp; Peripheral Control</strong> (SMPC). The SMPC is controlled with commands sent by the SH-2s.</p><h3 id="expansion-methods">Expansion methods</h3><p>This console bundles a considerable number of external connectors and interfaces that only received a handful of uses, at most.</p><ul><li>Behind the drive there’s a <strong>cartridge slot</strong> officially used for <strong>additional storage</strong> (save data) or <strong>extra RAM</strong>. In Japan and the United Stated, a modem was also offered to provide <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/mega-drive-genesis/#early-network-attempts">online functionality</a>.</li><li>At the back of the console, there’s a slot for a <strong>Video CD Card</strong> that performs MPEG decompression for programs/games that support it.</li><li>Finally, there’s a mysterious socket at the back of the console called <strong>Communication Connector</strong>. Sega didn’t publish any documentation for developers, but after some reverse engineering efforts, people discovered that it’s connected to the SCSP’s MIDI pins and the two SH-2’s serial interface (SCI) <sup id="bibref:23"><a href="#bib:games-development" role="doc-biblioref">[23]</a></sup>. In any case, Sega released a Floppy drive that relied on this interface.</li></ul><hr><h2 id="anti-piracy-homebrew">Anti-Piracy &amp; Homebrew</h2><p>In response to the easiness of cloning a CD, Saturn added a copy protection system (along with region locking) to control the distribution of games.</p><p>Copy protection on CDs is applied by burning special data (called ‘system area’) out of reach from conventional burners, the Saturn refuses to boot the disc as a ‘game disc’ if the out-of-reach data is not found or it’s invalid. The disc reader also contains a custom <strong>SH-1</strong> processor that interfaces with the rest of the console using obscured protocols.</p><p>It’s worth mentioning that since Saturn CDs follow the ISO9660 (a standard file system for CD data), PCs can read the game disc without problems (but, of course, they can’t execute the game unless they use an emulator).</p><h3 id="defeat">Defeat</h3><p>First of all, the classic method used for disabling the copy protection consisted in installing a <strong>mod-chip</strong> that could trick the CD reader when a burned disc is inserted. There was also a ‘swap trick’ that consisted in <strong>hot-swapping</strong> a genuine disc with a burned one just after the protection checks passed… with the risk of damaging the drive!</p><p>After the turn of the century, alternative but more sophisticated methods used for running unauthorised code were discovered, for instance:</p><ul><li>An <strong>exploit in the copy protection mechanism</strong> was found and it allowed to boot up any disc game without going through the copy protection checks. This was subsequently in the form of a cartridge called <strong>pseudosaturn</strong> <sup id="bibref:24"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-pseudosaturn" role="doc-biblioref">[24]</a></sup>. Due to the use of the cartridge medium, Action Replay cartridges are often re-flashed with pseudosaturn (though the flasher also needs to be bootstrapped somehow, most commonly through the swap trick).<ul><li>This method is still being used as of 2022, although a new fork of pseudosaturn named ‘Pseudo Saturn Kai’ is installed instead.</li></ul></li><li>Another method was reported in 2016 (almost 20 years later) by exploiting the fact that the <strong>Video CD add-on can inject unencrypted code</strong> to the CD subsystem (bypassing the CD reader altogether). This finally allowed users to load Homebrew independently of the ageing drive. The Video CD exploit is commercially distributed in a product called ‘Satiator’ (I’m not sponsored, by the way).</li><li>Finally, there’s another commercial alternative that replaces the CD reader with an SD or SATA adapter. The Saturn still thinks it’s reading from a CD, but the ‘CD’ is being emulated by the adapter, which is in turn reading from a disc image <sup id="bibref:25"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-ode" role="doc-biblioref">[25]</a></sup>. These products are called <strong>Optical Drive Emulators</strong> (ODE).</li></ul><hr><h2 id="thats-all-folks">That’s all folks</h2><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/saturn/mine.e96ef88708e597771584d2cdab33134986934020e7863ce6293b17d999d16ae0.jpg"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/saturn/_hu42db0004e070320862ad06f7d95006f4_128861_0881f77d5a3134ba6187a6473d340b74.webp 500w,
