          <p>Early on Thursday morning, a Saturn V-sized rocket ignited its seven main engines, a prelude to lifting off from Earth.</p>
<p>But then, the New Glenn rocket didn't move.</p>
<p>And still, the engines produced their blue flame, furiously burning away methane.</p>
<p>The thrust-to-weight of the rocket must have been in the vicinity of 1.0 to 1.2, so the booster had to burn a little liquid methane and oxygen before it could begin to climb appreciably. But finally, seconds into the mission, New Glenn did begin to climb. It was slow, ever so slow. But it flew true.</p>
<h2>Flying safe</h2>
<p>After that the vehicle performed like a champion. The first stage burned for more than three minutes before the second stage separated at an altitude of 70 km. Then, the upper stage's two BE-3U engines appeared to perform flawlessly, pushing the Blue Ring pathfinder payload toward orbit. These engines burned very nearly for 10 minutes before shutting down, having reached an orbital velocity of 28,800 kph.</p>
<p>For the first time since its founding, nearly a quarter of a century ago, Blue Origin had reached orbit. The long-awaited debut launch of the New Glenn rocket, a super-heavy lift vehicle developed largely with private funding, had come. And it was a smashing success.</p>
<p>The only downer came a little bit later when Blue Origin's Ariane Cornell confirmed that the first stage did not successfully return to Earth. "We did in fact lose the booster," Cornell said during the company's webcast. Far below in the Atlantic Ocean the drone ship <em>Jacklyn</em> awaited, a lone and lonely sentinel, with no rocket to catch.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="11b316ff" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default">
			<p><em><span>Contributed by Deb Chatterjee, Intel</span></em></p>
<p><span>We are excited to usher in the dawn of a new era for the P4 programming language. For many years, the Tofino family of programmable Ethernet switches, powered by P4, has represented the cutting edge of network innovation. Tofino’s unprecedented levels of programmability have enabled organizations to shape their networks like never before. But there was always one limitation: the software driving this groundbreaking hardware remained closed source. Today, that changes. The Tofino P4 software is being open-sourced, and it’s about to revolutionize how we think about programmable networks.</span></p>
<p><span>This bold move from Intel to open-source the Tofino P4 software is more than just a licensing decision; it’s a call to action for the global developer community. It invites everyone—from seasoned network engineers to aspiring students—to participate, innovate, and contribute to shaping the future of networking. The open-sourcing of Tofino P4 code democratizes access to some of the most powerful tools in networking. Developers can now dive deep into the workings of Tofino switches, experiment with custom data plane designs without restrictions, and share and build upon others’ innovations to create groundbreaking solutions, utilizing the power and strength of an open-source community.</span></p>
<p><span>Open source thrives on collaboration. By releasing the Tofino P4 code, we’re creating a community where developers can propose and implement new features, researchers can experiment with cutting-edge ideas in programmable networking, and educators can use open-source tools to train the next generation of network engineers. Traditionally, access to high-performance network programming tools has been limited by closed-source software, high costs, or proprietary restrictions. Open-sourcing Tofino P4 removes these barriers, allowing anyone with the curiosity and skills to participate. This democratization is a game-changer for startups, academic institutions, and developers in underrepresented regions. Aspiring P4 developers can now explore, dissect, and learn from production-grade software. This real-world exposure will be valuable for understanding how P4 programming operates at scale. Educational institutions can even build programming curricula around this. In the words of Brad Burres, Intel Senior Fellow, “open sourcing software is the best way to accelerate industry innovation and lift all boats”.&nbsp; Nanda Kuruganti, Intel VP of Networking SW, points out that “P4 programming and an open ecosystem are the cornerstones of our networking strategy. By open-sourcing Tofino P4 software, we aim to empower the community to drive innovation and unlock the full potential of programmable networks.”</span></p>
<p><span>Developers now have access to the entire source code, which is organized in two main repos inside the p4lang structure. The p4c repo now additionally contains the Tofino compiler components, with subfolders such as arch, common, control-plane, driver, midend, test and docs. The <a href="https://github.com/p4lang/p4c/tree/main/backends/tofino" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tofino backend</a> is hierarchically at the same level as bmv2, ubpf and other backends. The newly introduced <a href="https://github.com/p4lang/open-p4studio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open-p4studio repo</a> contains all the other components of the Tofino P4 Studio, such as bf_driver, bf_diags, bf_utils and tofino_model.</span></p>
<p><span>We are immensely grateful to the following individuals within Intel who worked on the open sourcing effort – Glen Gibb, Han Wang, Prathima Kotikalapudi, Anil Samal, Vaishnavi Tipireddy, Shiv Kumar, Shuai Zhang, Rohit Nair, and Sai Pracheetha Beeyam. We also benefited immensely from the guidance from the P4 Technical Steering Committee members, Fabian Ruffy and Andy Fingerhut.</span></p>
<p><span>The open-sourcing of Tofino P4 software is not just a milestone—it’s an invitation. It’s a call for developers, researchers, educators, and network enthusiasts to come together and shape the future of programmable networking. We encourage developers to dive into the repository, read the code, and understand how Tofino P4 works. The more they learn, the more they can contribute. Whether it’s fixing bugs, adding features, or improving documentation, every contribution helps the community grow.</span></p>
<p><span>We are asking P4 enthusiasts all over the world to spread the word about the open-sourcing of Tofino P4, and encourage their peers, colleagues, and organizations to join the P4 movement.</span></p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Over more than a decade there has been an extensive research effort on how to effectively utilize recurrent models and attention. While recurrent models aim to compress the data into a fixed-size memory (called hidden state), attention allows attending to the entire context window, capturing the direct dependencies of all tokens. This more accurate modeling of dependencies, however, comes with a quadratic cost, limiting the model to a fixed-length context. We present a new neural long-term memory module that learns to memorize historical context and helps attention to attend to the current context while utilizing long past information. We show that this neural memory has the advantage of fast parallelizable training while maintaining a fast inference. From a memory perspective, we argue that attention due to its limited context but accurate dependency modeling performs as a short-term memory, while neural memory due to its ability to memorize the data, acts as a long-term, more persistent, memory. Based on these two modules, we introduce a new family of architectures, called Titans, and present three variants to address how one can effectively incorporate memory into this architecture. Our experimental results on language modeling, common-sense reasoning, genomics, and time series tasks show that Titans are more effective than Transformers and recent modern linear recurrent models. They further can effectively scale to larger than 2M context window size with higher accuracy in needle-in-haystack tasks compared to baselines.

<p>As I’ve shared with family, friends and our team since late last year, I have made the decision to disband Hindenburg Research. The plan has been to wind up after we finished the pipeline of ideas we were working on. And as of the last Ponzi cases we just completed and are sharing with regulators, that day is today.</p>



<p>I write this from a place of joy. Building this has been a life’s dream.</p>



<p>I did not know at the outset if it would be possible to find a fulfilling path. This wasn’t an easy option, but I was naïve to the danger and felt drawn to it magnetically.</p>



<p>When I started this, I doubted I was capable. I didn’t have a traditional finance background. None of my relatives are in this field. I went to a state school. I’m not a slick salesperson. I don’t know any of the right clothes to wear. I can’t play golf. I’m not some superhuman that can function on 4 hours of sleep. In most of my jobs I was a good worker but mostly looked over. I had no money when I started—and after catching 3 lawsuits immediately out of the gate, I quickly had less than no money. I would have failed right at the starting line had it not been for the support of world-class whistleblower lawyer <a href="https://www.pugsleywood.com/lawyers/bryan-a-wood/">Bryan Wood</a>, who took the cases on despite my lack of financial resources. I had a newborn child and was facing eviction at the time. I was terrified, but knew that if I stayed still I would crumble. The only option I had was to keep moving forward.</p>



<p>It is very easy to succumb to negative thoughts and believe what others think of you, especially when things feel low. But it is possible to shatter all of that. I was passionate about this and I let that carry me forward despite my fears and insecurities.</p>



<p>And then this slowly started to flourish.</p>



<p>One at a time, and without a clear plan, we built a team of 11 incredible people. I hired each of them not because we needed workers, but because when our paths crossed and I could see who they were, I realized it was madness not to bring them on.</p>



<p>They are all smart, focused, and fun to work with. Little to no ego. When you meet them, they are all very nice and polite. But when it comes to this field, they are ruthless assassins, capable of world-class work. Like me, our team didn’t come from traditional finance backgrounds. My first hire often describes himself as a former bartender. We all have a shared view of the world, a mostly calm exterior, and a similar burning underlying intensity. They are all family to me.</p>



<p>We have all worked extremely hard, with a focus on precision and letting the evidence dictate our words.</p>



<p>Sometimes this meant taking big swings and taking on fights that are much bigger than any of us as individuals. Fraud, corruption, and negativity often seem overwhelming. Early on, a sense of justice was usually elusive. When it happened, it was tremendously fulfilling. It kept us going when we needed it.</p>



<p>And boy did we have an impact, eventually—more than I imagined was possible at the outset. Nearly 100 individuals have been charged civilly or criminally by regulators at least in part through our work, including billionaires and oligarchs. We shook some empires that we felt needed shaking.</p>



<p>Over time, people began to see what I hoped we could show—that having an impact is possible, no matter who you are.</p>



<p>It has also been rather intense, and at times, all-encompassing. I often wake up from my dreams because I’ve thought of a new investigative thread to pull on in my sleep, or an edit that clarifies a point I didn’t realize I was troubled by during the day. Or from the general pressure of it all. We are not fearless—we just have faith in the truth and hope it leads us down the right path.</p>



<p>I’m grateful for all of it. We have days of bizarre, hilarious and ridiculous stories and we’ve had a lot of fun amidst the pressure and challenges. It has been the adventure of a lifetime.</p>



<p>So, why disband now? There is not one specific thing—no particular threat, no health issue, and no big personal issue.</p>



<p>Someone once told me that at a certain point a successful career becomes a selfish act. Early on, I felt I needed to prove some things to myself. I have now finally found some comfort with myself, probably for the first time in my life. I probably could have had it all along had I let myself, but I needed to put myself through a bit of hell first. The intensity and focus has come at the cost of missing a lot of the rest of the world and the people I care about. I now view Hindenburg as a chapter in my life, not a central thing that defines me.</p>



<p>Beyond my own desire for relief, it also feels selfish to keep the knowledge we’ve accumulated trapped within our small team. I have more than enough. In the past several years we’ve been flooded with thousands of messages from many of you asking how we do what we do, or whether you can join the team. I read them all and I’ve been trying to figure out how to respond in a way that can answer everyone—so over the next 6 months or so I plan to work on a series of materials and videos to open-source every aspect of our model and how we conduct our investigations.</p>



<p>My hope is that after we fully share our process, in a couple years I will get an unsolicited message from someone who reads this (maybe you), who embraces the same passion, learns the craft, and finds the confidence to shed some light on a subject that needs it, despite the obstacles in your way. That would make my day, even if I’m off trying to learn music or planting a garden or whatever I end up doing next.</p>



<p>For now, I will be focused on making sure everyone on our team lands where they want to be next. Some are going to start their own research firm, which I will strongly and publicly encourage, even as I will have no personal involvement. There are others on our team who are now free agents—so feel free to reach out to me if you have a need for anyone who is brilliant, focused, and easy to work with, as they all are.</p>



<p>It wasn’t always obvious to me, but I now view all of this as a love story. To my wife, you have been so patient with me. It has not been easy, to put it mildly, and I am forever grateful that you have sacrificed so much and pushed forward with me. And now, my dear, we get to enjoy it together for as long as this world will let us.</p>



<p>To my family and friends, I’m sorry for the times I have ignored you while I let my attention be drawn away. I can’t wait to have more time to share with you together.</p>



<p>Lastly, I want to express how grateful I am to our readers. Your messages of kindness and encouragement through the years have gone a long way to help give us the strength to continue. And it constantly reminds me that the world is filled with good. Thank you for all of it—I couldn’t ask for more. It is all a blessing.</p>



<p>With unfathomable levels of gratitude,</p>



<p>Nate Anderson </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-parent="true" id="row-unique-1"><div><p>Conventional wisdom in semiconductor manufacturing has long held that bigger chips mean worse yields. Yet at Cerebras, we’ve successfully built and commercialized a chip 50x larger than the largest computer chips – and achieved comparable yields. This seeming paradox is one of our most frequently asked questions: how do we achieve a usable yield with a wafer-scale processor?</p>
<p>The answer lies in rethinking the relationship between chip size and fault tolerance. This article will provide a detailed, apples-to-apples comparison of manufacturing yields between the Cerebras Wafer Scale Engine and an H100-sized chip, both manufactured at 5nm. By examining the interplay between defect rates, core size, and fault tolerance, we’ll show how we achieve wafer scale integration with equal or better yields vs. reticle limited GPUs.</p>
<h3>What determines yield</h3>
<p>Like any manufacturing process, computer chips are prone to defects. Larger chips are more likely to encounter defects, thus as chips grow in size, yields fall exponentially with increasing die area. Even though larger chips generally run faster, early microprocessors were built to a modest size to maintain acceptable manufacturing yields and profit margins. In the early 2000s, this started to change. As transistor budgets grew to over 100 million, it became the norm to build processors with multiple independent cores per chip. Since all the cores were identical and independent, chip designers built-in core-level fault tolerance so that if one core suffered a defect, the remaining cores could still operate. For example in 2006 Intel released the Intel Core Duo – a chip with two CPU cores. If one core was faulty, it was disabled and the product was sold as an Intel Core Solo. Nvidia, AMD, and others all embraced this core-level redundancy in the coming years.</p>
</div><div><p><img decoding="async" src="https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-01-scaled.jpg" width="2560" height="919" alt="" srcset="https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-01-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-01-300x108.jpg 300w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-01-1024x368.jpg 1024w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-01-768x276.jpg 768w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-01-1536x551.jpg 1536w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-01-2048x735.jpg 2048w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-01-350x126.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"></p>
					</div><div><p>Today, fault tolerance is widely used by high performance processors and it’s perfectly normal to sell chips with some cores disabled. AMD and Intel CPUs generally ship a flagship version with all cores enabled and a lower end version with a portion of cores disabled. Nvidia’s data center GPUs are substantially larger than CPU dies and as a result even its flagship models have some portion of cores disabled.</p>
<p>Take the Nvidia H100 – a massive GPU weighing in at 814mm<sup>2</sup>. Traditionally this chip would be very difficult to yield economically. But since its cores (SMs) are fault tolerant, a manufacturing defect does not knock out the entire product. The chip physically has 144 SMs but the commercialized product only has 132 SMs active. This means the chip could suffer numerous defects across 12 SMs and still be sold as a flagship part.</p>
<h3>Defect tolerance is the key to yield</h3>
<p>Traditionally, chip size directly dictated chip yields. In the modern era, yield is a function of both chip size and defect tolerance. 800mm<sup>2</sup> chips were once thought infeasible to commercialize due to yield, but by using defect tolerant design, they are now mainstream products.</p>
<p>The degree of defect tolerance can be measured by the amount of chip area that is lost when a defect occurs. For multi-core chips, this means the smaller the core, the greater the defect tolerance. If individual cores are small enough, it may be possible to build a very large chip.</p>
<h3>Wafer Scale Engine Cores</h3>
</div><div><p><img decoding="async" src="https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-wafer-scale-01.jpg" width="1640" height="862" alt="" srcset="https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-wafer-scale-01.jpg 1640w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-wafer-scale-01-300x158.jpg 300w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-wafer-scale-01-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-wafer-scale-01-768x404.jpg 768w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-wafer-scale-01-1536x807.jpg 1536w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-wafer-scale-01-350x184.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 1640px) 100vw, 1640px"></p>
					</div><div><p>At Cerebras, before committing to build a wafer-scale chip, we first designed a very small core. Each AI core in the Wafer Scale Engine 3 is approximately 0.05mm<sup>2</sup> or about 1% the size of an H100 SM core. Both core designs are fault tolerant. This means a defect in a WSE core would disable 0.05mm<sup>2</sup> of silicon while the same defect in an H100 disables ~6mm<sup>2</sup>. To a first order of approximation, the wafer scale engine is ~100x more fault tolerant than a GPU when considering the silicon area affected by each defect.</p>
<h3>The Routing Architecture</h3>
</div><div><p><img decoding="async" src="https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-defects-01-scaled.jpg" width="2560" height="2050" alt="" srcset="https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-defects-01-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-defects-01-300x240.jpg 300w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-defects-01-1024x820.jpg 1024w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-defects-01-768x615.jpg 768w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-defects-01-1536x1230.jpg 1536w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-defects-01-2048x1640.jpg 2048w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-defects-01-350x280.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"></p>
					</div><div><p>But small cores alone aren’t enough. We developed a sophisticated routing architecture that allows us to dynamically reconfigure connections between cores. When a defect is detected, the system can automatically route around it using redundant communication pathways, preserving the chip’s overall computational capabilities by leveraging nearby cores.</p>
<p>This routing system works in concert with a small reserve of spare cores that can be used to replace defective units. Unlike previous approaches that required massive redundancy overhead, our architecture achieves high yield with minimal spare capacity through intelligent routing.</p>
<h3>A wafer scale walkthrough</h3>
<p>Defect tolerance at a chip level is fairly clear. Let’s now compare how a traditional GPU and a wafer-scale chip would yield using TSMC 5nm’s 300mm wafer:</p>
</div><div><p><img decoding="async" src="https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-GPUs-per-wafer-01.png" width="2146" height="1144" alt="" srcset="https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-GPUs-per-wafer-01.png 2146w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-GPUs-per-wafer-01-300x160.png 300w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-GPUs-per-wafer-01-1024x546.png 1024w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-GPUs-per-wafer-01-768x409.png 768w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-GPUs-per-wafer-01-1536x819.png 1536w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-GPUs-per-wafer-01-2048x1092.png 2048w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-GPUs-per-wafer-01-350x187.png 350w" sizes="(max-width: 2146px) 100vw, 2146px"></p>
					</div><div><p>On the left is a H100-like GPU: it is 814mm<sup>2</sup>, it has 144 fault tolerant cores, and a single 300mm wafer yields 72 full die chips. On the right we have the Cerebras Wafer Scale Engine 3. It’s one giant square measuring 46,225mm<sup>2</sup>. It has 970,000 fault tolerant cores. One wafer yields one chip.</p>
</div><div><p><img decoding="async" src="https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-02-scaled.jpg" width="2560" height="1071" alt="" srcset="https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-02-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-02-300x125.jpg 300w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-02-1024x428.jpg 1024w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-02-768x321.jpg 768w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-02-1536x642.jpg 1536w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-02-2048x856.jpg 2048w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-02-350x146.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"></p>
					</div><div><p>At the current TSMC 5nm node, TSMC’s process <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16028/better-yield-on-5nm-than-7nm-tsmc-update-on-defect-rates-for-n5"><span>reportedly</span></a> has ~0.001 defect per mm<sup>2</sup>. 72 GPU dies have total die area of 58,608mm<sup>2</sup>. Applying this defect density, this area would see a total of 59 defects. For simplicity, let’s assume each defect lands on a separate core. At 6.2mm<sup>2</sup> per core, this means 361mm<sup>2</sup> of die space would be lost of defects.</p>
<p>On the Cerebras side, the effective die size is a bit smaller at 46,225mm<sup>2</sup>. Applying the same defect rate, the WSE-3 would see 46 defects. Each core is 0.05mm<sup>2</sup>. This means 2.2mm<sup>2</sup> in total would be lost to defects.</p>
<p>Measuring the total area lost, the GPU in this case loses 164x more silicon area than the Wafer Scale Engine on an apple-to-apples basis on the same manufacturing node and defect rate.</p>
<p>The above makes a high-level point but simplifies a few details. First, not all areas of the chip are taken by the compute cores. Caches, memory controllers, and on-chip fabric take up a substantial amount of die size, perhaps up to 50%. However, these components can be designed to be fault tolerant in their own way. An H100 SM is likely smaller than 6.2mm<sup>2</sup> due to these components, though not by an order of magnitude. Second, a cluster of defects could overwhelm fault tolerant areas and disable the whole chip. In practice, even fault tolerant chips will not yield close to 100%. These caveats aside, the general rule that smaller cores make for greater fault tolerance still holds.</p>
<h3>Putting Cerebras in the Table</h3>
</div><div><p><img decoding="async" src="https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-03-scaled.jpg" width="2560" height="1029" alt="" srcset="https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-03-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-03-300x121.jpg 300w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-03-1024x412.jpg 1024w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-03-768x309.jpg 768w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-03-1536x617.jpg 1536w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-03-2048x823.jpg 2048w, https://cerebras.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/100x-tolerance-table-03-350x141.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"></p>
					</div><div><p>Let’s revisit the first table, now with the Cerebras Wafer Scale Engine added. Like Nvidia’s data center GPUs, the WSE-3 is designed to be fault-tolerant and disables a portion of its cores to manage yield. Because our cores are so tiny, the number of cores is so much larger – 970,000 physical cores with 900,000 active on our current shipping product. This provides tremendous, fine grained, defect tolerance. Despite having built the world’s largest chip, we enable 93% of our silicon area, which is higher than the leading GPU today.</p>
<p>To summarize, Cerebras resolved the wafer scale manufacturing challenge by designing a small fault-tolerant core in combination with a fault tolerant on-chip fabric. While total chip area increased by ~50x compared to conventional GPUs, we reduced individual core size by ~100x. As a result, defects are far less damaging to the WSE than conventional multi-core processors. The third generation WSE engine achieves 93% silicon utilization – the highest among leading AI accelerators – demonstrating that wafer-scale computing is not just possible, but commercially viable at scale.</p>

<p>The Wyoming Industrial Siting Council has granted a construction permit to TerraPower for its Natrium nuclear power plant near Kemmerer — a milestone achievement both in Wyoming and nationwide for commercial-scale “advanced nuclear” energy, the company says.</p>

<p>“This is the first state permit ever awarded to a commercial-scale advanced nuclear project and is a testament to the groundbreaking work of our TerraPower team,” TerraPower President and CEO Chris Levesque said in a prepared statement Tuesday.</p>

<p>The permit allows for construction of all non-nuclear portions of the Kemmerer Power Station Unit 1 plant. TerraPower has a <a href="https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/new-reactors/advanced/who-were-working-with/licensing-activities/pre-application-activities/natrium.html">permit application pending</a> before the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission for <a href="https://wyofile.com/southwest-wyoming-locals-pepper-feds-on-proposed-natrium-nuclear-plant/">all of the nuclear-related facilities</a>. “That application was submitted in March 2024 and is on track for approval in December 2026,” according to a TerraPower press statement. “The unique Natrium design enables the company to start non-nuclear construction onsite during the NRC review.”</p>

(Dustin Bleizeffer/WyoFile)</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>The state’s review included an analysis of environmental and socioeconomic impacts related to the facility, as well as potential avoidance measures such as noise limits and nighttime-light restrictions to minimize negative impacts on birds and skirting cultural resources when possible, according to the state and TerraPower’s 1,459-page permit application. The Industrial Siting Council — a gubernatorial-appointed panel connected to the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality — now has 45 days to draw up its approval order and issue the permit.</p>

<p>“The regulatory process to bring new nuclear plants to fruition is robust, and our team has been working relentlessly to successfully maneuver through a complicated, multi-jurisdictional environment to bring the first Natrium plant to market,” Levesque said.</p>

<p>TerraPower began construction on a stand-alone but related facility — a liquid sodium testing center — in June, marking the occasion with a <a href="https://wyofile.com/microsofts-gates-breaks-ground-on-novel-nuclear-power-plant-in-wyoming/">groundbreaking ceremony</a> that included some 300 guests and company founder, Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates. The phased nature of construction for the larger project will cycle in workers with different construction and engineering skills, peaking at about 1,600 workers in 2028, according to TerraPower.</p>

<p>The plant is slated to begin generating electricity in 2030.</p>


<h4><strong>Natrium project</strong></h4>

<p>TerraPower selected the Kemmerer location in the fall of 2021 after analyzing a handful of other potential locations in Wyoming to co-locate the facility next to a coal-fired power plant slated for retirement. The idea, according to the company, was to utilize existing infrastructure associated with coal plants, including tapping the local workforce. The company chose a site near the Naughton natural gas and coal-fired power plant just outside the towns of Kemmerer and Diamondville in Lincoln County.</p>

<p>One of three coal-burning units at the Naughton plant was converted to natural gas a few years ago. The remaining two coal units will be converted to natural gas in 2026, according to majority owner PacifiCorp. TerraPower has partnered with the U.S. Department of Energy, which is expected to contribute about $2 billion of the $4 billion effort, to develop the project, according to the company.</p>

<p>PacifiCorp, which operates as Rocky Mountain Power in Wyoming, has tentatively agreed to consider taking over Natrium operations and plug the power plant into its six-state electrical service territory.</p>
	
	
<p>Natrium is an “advanced” nuclear reactor design that will use liquid sodium for cooling. The plant will generate a consistent 345 megawatts of power — enough energy to power about 250,000 homes — with a capability of ramping up to 500 megawatts for short periods of time, according to TerraPower. The reactor will use high-assay, low-enriched uranium (HALEU) fuel.</p>

<p>The company originally proposed an in-service date of 2028, but had to push the start date back to 2030 due to global events. In 2022, following the invasion of Ukraine, <a href="https://wyofile.com/nixed-russian-fuel-supply-complicates-natrium-schedule/">TerraPower cut ties with the Russian state-owned Tenex</a> — the only facility in the world at the time with the capacity to supply commercial volumes of HALEU.</p>

      <p><span>GARY</span>: Hey Cindy, remember the other day when we were talking about optimizations?</p>
<p><span>CINDY</span>: Yeah, I wanted to circle back on that.</p>
<p><span>GARY</span>: Me too. You said you wanted to see hockey-stick growth. Well, I’ve realized that I want to see hockey-stick growth too—in our relationship.</p>
<p><span>CINDY</span>: Unpack that for me.</p>
<p><span>GARY</span>: This relationship has been such a value-add. Some of my friends were worried that it would take too long for us to get into alignment. But you have been an absolute rockstar.</p>
<p><span>CINDY</span>: I feel the same way, Gary. The <span>ROI</span> on this relationship has been unbelievable. You’ve really given 110 percent.</p>
<p><span>GARY</span>: So I wanted to close the loop. In addition to the other deliverables, I have one more. (<i>He takes a knee, and holds out his hand</i>.) It’s this wedding ring. Cindy, will you marry me?</p>
<p><span>CINDY</span>: I will, Gary. You have been an absolute ninja. This moves the needle in a significant way.</p>
<p><span>GARY</span>: Getting married will represent a huge pivot, but I see it as a quick win, and a real solve.</p>
<p><span>CINDY</span>: Me too. And we can talk about this later, but—I do want to make sure we go forward with a single source of truth.</p>
<p><span>GARY</span>: Break that down for me.</p>
<p><span>CINDY</span>: I used to be with a guy who was full of valuable insights—but his insights weren’t actionable, let alone fundable.</p>
<p><span>GARY</span>: Sounds like low-hanging fruit.</p>
<p><span>CINDY</span>: He was. And I know you’re different. The synergy is unbelievable. But I want to make sure we stay focused on core values. Which, for me, comes down to the bottom line.</p>
<p><span>GARY</span>: By bottom line, you’re talking about the financials?</p>
<p><span>CINDY</span>: Not having enough spend was a big pain point for me. I don’t know how else to say it. You’re more than your financials, but you’re not less than them.</p>
<p>(<i>Long pause.</i>)</p>
<p><span>GARY</span>: I think I understand.</p>
<p><span>CINDY</span>: Just wanted to touch base on how you’re feeling about that.</p>
<p><span>GARY</span>: Well, look. We both know the importance of data-driven insights. So I think I’ve got a solve. What if we set up a weekly one-on-one to check in and stack hands on the financials as we start to plan for our new normal?</p>
<p><span>CINDY</span>: I would love that. But I’m so sorry, I have a three-thirty.</p>
<p><span>GARY</span>: Okay, let’s table this for now. In the meantime, if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask.</p>
<p><span>CINDY</span>: Sounds good. Let’s circle back tonight, and we can action on our solve.</p>
