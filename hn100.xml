<p><img src="https://www.raptitude.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/artem-beliaikin-v6kii3H5CcU-unsplash.jpg" width="600" height="400" alt="Post image for Nobody Knows What’s Going On"></p><p>A major online publication once reported in a profile on me that I had retired at 33. A few old friends and acquaintances reached out to congratulate me on my financial independence.</p>



<p>I think it was an honest mistake on the part of the reporter. I told her I had quit my job to write full time, and I guess she thought that meant I must have millions of dollars.</p>



<p>To be clear, I was not then, and am not now financially independent. The 100 or so people that actually know me could discern that just by seeing my kitchen. Yet perhaps 20,000 people read somewhere that I am. That means potentially 200 times more people are wrong than right on this question, because of an inference made by a reporter.</p>



<p>This scenario, in which there’s much more wrongness going around than rightness, is probably the norm. People make bad inferences like that all day long. These wrong ideas replicate themselves whenever the person tells someone else what they know, which the internet makes easier than ever.</p>



<p>Consider the possibility that <em>most</em> of the information being passed around, on whatever topic, is bad information, even where there’s no intentional deception. As George Orwell said, “The most fundamental mistake of man is that he thinks he knows what’s going on. Nobody knows what’s going on.”</p>



<p>Technology may have made this state of affairs inevitable. Today, the vast majority of a person’s worldview is assembled from second-hand sources, not from their own experience. Second-hand knowledge, from “reliable” sources or not, usually functions as hearsay – if it <em>seems</em> true, it is immediately incorporated into one’s worldview, usually without any attempt to substantiate it. Most of what you “know” is just something you heard somewhere.</p>

<p>When people go on to share what they “know”, there’s usually no penalty for being wrong, but there are rewards for convincing people you’re right: attention, money, adoration, public rhetorical victories over others, and many other things humans enjoy.</p>



<h3>The Two Kinds of Knowing</h3>



<p>First-hand knowledge is a whole different thing from the second-hand kind. When you experience an event with your senses, you’re not just accepting a verbal claim, such as “There’s fighting in the streets of Kabul” — the truth is actually happening to you. The experienced sailor <em>knows</em> that looming cloud formation means trouble. The soldier knows the attack on his unit’s position was repelled. The dog owner knows exactly how long she can leave Rocco alone at home before he relieves himself on the floor. The friend sitting on my fifteen-year-old couch knows I’m not independently wealthy. Experience imprints reality right into your neurons; it doesn’t just add another thought to the abstract space in your brain where you keep your axioms and factoids.</p>


<div>

<p>Only a tiny percentage of what a given person “knows” is in this first-hand, embodied form. The rest is made of impressions gathered from anecdotes, newspapers, books, schoolteachers, blogs, and things our older siblings told us when we were little.</p>



<p>If you ever read an article on a subject with which you have a lot of first-hand experience, you’ll notice that they <em>always</em> get major things wrong – basic facts, dates, names of people and organizations, the stated intentions of involved parties, the reasons a thing is happening – things even a novice in the space would know better about.</p>



<p>It makes perfect sense, if you think about it, that reporting is so reliably unreliable. Why do we expect reporters to learn about a suddenly newsworthy situation, gather information about it under deadline, then confidently explain the subject to the rest of the nation after having known about it for all of a week? People form their entire worldviews out of this stuff.</p>

<p>What doesn’t make sense is that we immediately become credulous again as soon as the subject matter changes back to a topic on which we <em>don’t </em>have first-hand experience. You know they don’t know what they hell they’re talking about on Subject A, but hey what’s this about Subject B? In 2002, author Michael Crichton named this the “Gell-Mann Amnesia effect”:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Briefly stated, the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect is as follows. You open the newspaper to an article on some subject you know well. In [Murray Gell-Mann’s] case, physics. In mine, show business. You read the article and see the journalist has absolutely no understanding of either the facts or the issues. Often, the article is so wrong it actually presents the story backward—reversing cause and effect. I call these the “wet streets cause rain” stories. Paper’s full of them.</p>



<p>In any case, you read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in a story, and then turn the page to national or international affairs, and read as if the rest of the newspaper was somehow more accurate about Palestine than the baloney you just read. You turn the page, and forget what you know.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Crichton clarifies in the <a href="https://www.docdroid.net/4wgVecr/why-speculate-michael-crichton-pdf#page=2">full speech</a> that by “media” he’s not only talking about newspapers, but books, television, and internet too, and of course anybody’s recounting of what these sources say. Well, that accounts for just about 100% of our second-hand knowledge.</p>

<p>People do know things though. We have airplanes and phones and spaceships. Clearly somebody knows something. Human beings <em>can</em> be reliable sources of knowledge, but only about small slivers of the whole of what’s going on. They know things because they deal with their sliver every day, and they’re personally invested in how well they know their sliver, which gives them constant feedback on the quality of their beliefs.</p>



<p>Plumbing knowledge, for example, is constantly tested by whether the place floods after you’ve advanced your theory about what pipe connects to what. You need to get it right because it costs you something when you get it wrong.</p>



<p>The mechanic has seen a thousand check-engine lights and knows how each of them was resolved. The English professor has seen a thousand essays and can tell you what’s wrong with yours. The night club bouncer has dealt with a thousand drunk patrons and knows which guests will be trouble even before they do.</p>

<p>There are ways to carefully gather, scrutinize, and compare high-quality second-hand sources, and maybe learn something reliable, but this is extremely difficult for the groupish, emotional creature we are. It is <a href="https://www.raptitude.com/2023/05/how-to-think-about-politics-without-going-insane/">viscerally unpleasant</a> (not to mention time-consuming) to honestly question beliefs you feel positively towards, or honestly entertain ones you don’t, and ultimately you’re just determining what “feels right” anyway.</p>



<p>Aside from our own respective slivers of reliable knowledge, we mostly carry a lot of untested beliefs — teetering piles of them, accumulated over years, from random people assuring us “this is how it is.” Most of these beliefs are bunk, but we don’t know which ones. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Beliefs are Mostly Mind-Candy</h3>



<p>Humans love beliefs, not because they’re reliable pointers to what’s true, but because they often feel good in some way, or have social rewards. Expressing and sharing beliefs can get us attention and social status, make us feel competent, sell our goods and services, and motivate people to do things for us, and they can just feel satisfying to say aloud. A convincing belief is simply one that feels good to the ears, or the mind.</p>

<p>Theory feels good. Pithiness and analogy feel good. A tight sentence feels good. Neat and snappy stories about what’s “true” are like candy to the sense-craving part of the human brain.</p>



<p>Notice how many smart people believe things like, “You can’t reason yourself out of a belief you didn’t reason yourself into.” This is a belief nobody would arrive at through reason. It doesn’t stand up to even a minute’s logical scrutiny. You certainly didn’t reason yourself into a belief that North-Pole-dwelling elves made your childhood toys, but you probably reasoned yourself out of it. Both beliefs are just mind-candy, only for different audiences.</p>



<p>In short, human beings are bad at gathering information, inferring the right things from it, and responsibly passing it on to others. It is incredible what we’ve achieved in spite of this — almost entirely by carefully combining and testing our respective reliable slivers — but as a species we remain supremely untalented at knowing what’s true outside the range of our senses.</p>


<div>
<figure><a href="https://www.raptitude.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Kids_in_the_Hall_Brain_Candy_poster.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="257" height="388" src="https://www.raptitude.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Kids_in_the_Hall_Brain_Candy_poster.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.raptitude.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Kids_in_the_Hall_Brain_Candy_poster.jpg 257w, https://www.raptitude.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Kids_in_the_Hall_Brain_Candy_poster-199x300.jpg 199w, https://www.raptitude.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Kids_in_the_Hall_Brain_Candy_poster-127x192.jpg 127w" sizes="(max-width: 257px) 100vw, 257px"></a><figcaption><em>A relevant documentary (1996)</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Much of the problem is that we want so badly to be believed, to be seen as someone who knows stuff. In the rest of Crichton’s speech, he explains why he named the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect after Murray Gell-Mann: because he’s famous, and he’s a physicist. People believe things named after physicists because we know they’re smart. And Crichton is a medical doctor, so you should listen to the guy.</p>



<p>Also, none of you will be able to confirm this, but George Orwell did not say the line in the intro of this article. I just said that he did so you would take my own assertions more seriously. And it’s too late — you’ve already tasted the candy. I mean, Orwell could have said something like that. He might as well have said it. He probably did, basically! I will sleep soundly anyway. There are few penalties for bullshit, and many rewards. Because nobody knows what’s going on.</p>

<h2>F</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.nsl.com/k/f/f.k">F</a> is a pure functional concatenative 
language originally designed as an extension of <a href="http://www.nsl.com/papers/false.htm">False</a>. F contains the list-operations of <a href="http://www.kx.com/">K3</a> and the <em>dip</em> combinator 
of <a href="http://www.latrobe.edu.au/philosophy/phimvt/joy.html">Joy</a>. Floating-point and symbolic datatypes are supported. One-time assignment
is enforced in syntax. A theory of function-valence and -charge is outlined. F also contains a general continuation
primitive $, and the pattern sublanguage of <a href="http://www.nsl.com/k/xy/xy.htm">XY</a>.  <a href="http://www.nsl.com/k/f/g.k">G</a> is a variant of F in which the K3 adverbs are implemented as primitives.</p>

<h2>0. Introduction</h2>

<p>F has the following properties:</p>

<blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li>The language is concatenative</li>
        <li>The language is purely functional</li>
        <li>All K verbs are implemented</li>
        <li>All primitives are denoted by single symbols</li>
        <li>Primitive symbols are as mnemonic as possible</li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>

<p><em>The language is concatenative.</em> F tokens are words,
words denote functions, and the concatenation of words denotes
the composition of functions. In classical concatenative
languages, everything is a function from stacks to stacks. In F,
everything is a function from triples of
(environment;stack;queue) to triples of
(environment;stack;queue).</p>

<p><em>The language is purely functional.</em> There are no
side-effects. F has assignment, but not reassignment. This means
that you can't use a variable to store dynamic state. F
assignment associates names with values in an environment which
is passed as an argument and returned as a value. F also has
commands for interacting with the run-time environment and the
file-system, but these operations are notationally differentiated
from the operators of F: "h", "r", &amp;c.
They are intended as debugging aids only.</p>

<p><em>All K verbs are implemented.</em> Some K verbs are
implemented as primitives, and some are derived in the F prelude.
For example, the <em>atom</em> primitive @ of K is defined as
[#ints~]; i.e. shape matches the empty integer vector. Where K
provides a pair of functions, one of which is easily defined in
terms of the other, F implements one as a primitive and derives the
other. For example, <em>and</em> is primitive (&amp;) and <em>or</em>
is derived.  The criterion for dividing related pairs is simply
this:  the derived definition must not be egregiously inefficient
when compared to the primitive it supplants.</p>

<p><em>All primitives are denoted by single symbols.</em>
Although list-notation ([x y z]) is supported, any list can be
constructed functionally with ' (<em>quote</em>) and , (<em>join</em>).</p>

<p><em>Primitive symbols are as mnemonic as possible.</em> There
are five ways the mapping of a function to a symbol can be
mnemonic:</p>

<blockquote>
    <ol>
        <li>The symbol is in common use for the mapped function
            (e.g. + for addition)</li>
        <li>The symbol is mapped to that function in K (e.g. ?
            for <em>find</em>) or False (e.g. ! for <em>unquote</em>)</li>
        <li>The name of the symbol is a homonym for the mapped
            function (e.g. ' for <em>quote</em>)</li>
        <li>A pair of related functions (inverses, or
            near-inverses) are mapped to a pair of related
            symbols (e.g. / and \ for <em>take</em> and <em>drop</em>)</li>
        <li>Where several K primitives are mapped to one symbol,
            the primitives should form an easily remembered group
            based on some common property; e.g. both <em>upgrade</em>
            and <em>enum</em> return indices based on an
            ascending relation, so both are mapped to &lt;. </li>
    </ol>
</blockquote>

<h2>1. Datatypes</h2>

<p>The initial state of the interpreter consists of an
environment containing the F words of the prelude, an empty
result stack, and a string (character-vector) to be evaluated.
The input string is tokenized and parsed to obtain the initial
queue. </p>

<p>The input queue is a K list, possibly containing integers,
floats, symbols, <em>null</em>, functions, and lists
("quotations"). The result stack is initially empty.
The environment is a K dictionary. F processes the environment,
stack, and queue repeatedly until the queue is empty. </p>

<p>If the first item on the queue is an integer, float, <em>null</em>,
the prototype symbol `, or a list, the item is pushed onto the
stack.</p>

<p>If the first item is an undefined symbol, then if it's a <em>shuffle</em>
it's applied; otherwise, a variable is created (in the environment)
having the top of the stack as the value. </p>

<p>If the first item is a defined symbol, its value is
retrieved (from the environment) and pushed onto the stack.</p>

<p>If the first item is a function, then it is applied to the
environment, stack, and queue to produce a new environment,
stack, and queue.</p>

<p>Observe that the domain of the result stack is a proper subset
of the domain of the input queue. On the queue we may find
character-atoms, such as "r", and strings, such as
"blah". But character-atoms are executed away when they
are evaluated, and no F primitive ever produces one, and strings
are comments, which are not processed.</p>

<p>The <em>trace</em> command displays the stack and queue for
selected objects in the trace list T:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>F&gt;[fac] "t"

F&gt;3 fac!
                                       3 ♦ fac !

<h3>System Functions (K)</h3>

<p>The K system functions have reserved names:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>type (4::)
log exp abs sqr sqrt floor dot mul inv lsq
sin cos tan asin acos atan sinh cosh tanh
draw
in lin bin binl dv dvl di vs sv</pre>
</blockquote>

<h3>Literals (L)</h3>

Inf		maxint (0I)

nan		NaN (0n)
inf		infinity (0i)

null		null (_n)

</blockquote>

<h3>Commands (I)</h3>

<blockquote>
    <pre>".."		comment		1 "skip" 2	comment not processed

"b"		break		'x "b"		signal error ('x)

</pre></blockquote>

<h3>Names and numbers</h3>

<p>Spaces (<em>blank</em>, <em>tab</em>, <em>return</em>) are
necessary to separate names from names and numbers from numbers,
but not names from numbers.</p>

<p>A name must begin with a letter and may contain letters, .,
or a single -.  A name containing a - is a shuffle-symbol.</p>

<p>A numerical expression must begin with either a digit or - 
followed by a digit, and must end with a digit.  A floating-point 
numerical expression must contain exactly one . which
must be flanked by digits.</p>

<h3>Operators</h3>

<p>The math, logic, and relational operators are <em>atomic
functions</em>. For example,</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>F&gt;[1 2 3][[4 5 6] 7 8]+
[[5 6 7] 9 11]</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>In several instances, distinct K operations have been mapped
to one symbol: </p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>int &lt;			enum			!x
~atom &lt;			upgrade			&lt;x
atom &lt;			nonce

int/ints @		where			&amp;x
list @			flip			+x
			nonce

atom y ?		mod			y!x
~atom y ?		find			x?y

list atom \		rotate			y!x
atom list \		drop			x _ y
atom atom \		drop			x _(),y
list list \		cut			x _ y

1=#x .			infra
x .			index/monad/dyad	. x</pre>
</blockquote>

<h3>Iterators</h3>

<p>The False combinators <em>if</em> and <em>while</em> have been
eliminated, and <em>cond</em>, <em>if</em>, and <em>while</em>
have been defined as words in the prelude. The truth-values of F
are more general than those of K: 0 is <em>false</em>, any other
value is <em>true</em>.</p>

<h3>Assignment</h3>

<p>Assignment has the form <em>value unassigned_name</em>. An
assigned name may not be re-assigned.</p>

<p>Reserved names cannot be assigned:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>F&gt;12 inf
12 inf</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Use of an assigned name (a variable) places the value assigned
to it on the stack:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>F&gt;10 a

F&gt;a
10
F&gt;12 a
10 12 10
F&gt;a
10 12 10 10</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>A symbol can be produced indirectly:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>F&gt;10 foo

F&gt;foo
10
F&gt;[foo] first!
foo
F&gt;!
10</pre>
</blockquote>

<h3>Quotation</h3>

<p>The <em>quote</em> primitive ' takes the next item on the
queue and quotes it:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>F&gt;'+
[+]
F&gt;
F&gt;'[1 2 3]
[[1 2 3]]
F&gt;
F&gt;''
[']</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The <em>unquote</em> combinator ! is Joy's <em>i</em>. ! takes
the top item <em>x</em> on the stack and prepends the elements of
<em>x</em> to the queue:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>F&gt;2 3 '+ !
5</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The <em>dip</em> combinator is defined as it is in Joy. `
takes the top two items <em>x</em> <em>y</em> on the stack and
prepends <em>y,,x</em> to the queue. For example, with trace on,
the input queue is displayed to the right of the diamond and the
result stack to the left:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>F&gt;10 2 3 4 20 [+*]`
                                         ♦ 10 2 3 4 20 [+ *] `
                                      10 ♦ 2 3 4 20 [+ *] `
                                    10 2 ♦ 3 4 20 [+ *] `
                                  10 2 3 ♦ 4 20 [+ *] `
                                10 2 3 4 ♦ 20 [+ *] `
                             10 2 3 4 20 ♦ [+ *] `
                       10 2 3 4 20 [+ *] ♦ `
                                10 2 3 4 ♦ + * 20
                                  10 2 7 ♦ * 20
                                   10 14 ♦ 20
                                10 14 20 ♦
F&gt;</pre>
</blockquote>

<h3>State</h3>

<p>F has two programs for manipulating the stack, and two for
manipulating the queue:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>stack		push the stack onto the stack
unstack		set the stack to the top of the stack  
queue		move the top of the stack to the queue
unqueue		move the end of the queue to the stack</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>These are defined using the <em>state</em> combinator $:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>[[[|uncons!|swap!]`swap!unit!,]$]       queue
[[|uncons!|[unit!,]`]$]                 unqueue

[[[dup!unit!,]`]$]                      stack
[[[last!]`]$]                           unstack</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>$ expects a program on top of the stack. The program expects
two quotations beneath it: the current queue, and beneath that,
the current stack. F expects the program to return two
quotations: the new queue, and beneath that, the new list.</p>

<h3>Stack Operations</h3>

<p>The False stack operators <em>pop</em>, <em>dup</em>, and <em>swap</em>
are defined using shuffles:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>[a-]                            pop
[ab-ba]                         swap
[a-aa]                          dup</pre>
</blockquote>

<h3>List Operations</h3>

<p>The list operations <em>cons</em> and <em>uncons</em> are
total: </p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>F&gt;1 2 cons!
[1 2]
F&gt;

F&gt;[1 2] uncons!
1 [2]
F&gt;

F&gt;[1] uncons!
1 ints
F&gt;

F&gt;[] uncons!
null []
F&gt;

F&gt;2 uncons!
2 ints</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>These are defined using the ( and ) operators:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>[[[[a A]]a A])]                 uncons
[[[a b][a]b,](]                 cons</pre>
</blockquote>

<h3>Errors</h3>
<blockquote><pre><em>F stack</em>			The stack-valence greater than the stack-size.

<em>F queue</em>			The queue-valence is greater than the queue-size.

<em>F pattern</em>		The stack-size is greater than the pattern scheme-size.

<em>F char: &lt;x&gt;</em>		x is an illegal character.

<em>F nonce: &lt;x&gt;</em>		Primitive x is not defined for the arguments supplied.
</pre></blockquote>

<h2>3. Implementation</h2>

</blockquote>

<h2>4. Operation</h2>

<p>Say</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>k f</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>to start the F interpreter.</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>k f .. &lt;script&gt; ..</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>starts the interpreter, then reads and evaluates the F
scripts. For example</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>k f f/fac</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Joy or F semantics may be specified with an initial boolean
value of J:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>k f 1 f/fac</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The prompt is F&gt; for F semantics and J&gt; for Joy
semantics.</p>

<p>If, in a .f or .j script, the interpreter encounters a single
unmated ", evaluation on that script terminates. (Analogous
to \ in .k scripts.)</p>

<p>Exit to K, or from the current trace or stop, by entering a
single space. Clear the stack by pressing &lt;return&gt; with
null input.</p>

<h2>5. Examples</h2>

</blockquote>

<p>An F script containing synonyms for the symbolic operations is

semantics are <a href="http://www.nsl.com/k/f/f/prelude.j">here</a> and <a href="http://www.nsl.com/k/f/f/fac.j">here</a>.</p>

<h2>6. Comments</h2>

<h3>Names</h3>

<p>In Joy, use of a name causes the value associated with the
name to be executed against the stack:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>plustwo == 2 +</pre>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <pre>3 plustwo .
5</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>In F, use of a name causes the value associated with the name
to placed on the stack:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>F&gt;[2 +] plustwo

F&gt;3 plustwo
3 [2 +]</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The value may then be executed with !:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>3 [2 +]
F&gt;!
5</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>In Joy, adjacent names must be separated by a blank, or the
equivalent. The corresponding F code has greater visual density,
but is nearly as concise. For example, the <em>reduce</em>
combinator is:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>[swap!dup!proto!swap!unit!bot!over!]</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>as opposed to:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>[swap dup proto swap unit bot over]</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>One might say that F occupies a middle-ground between Joy,
which evaluates names aggressively, and False, which breaks the
semantics of name evaluation into even smaller steps:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>[swap;!dup;!proto;!swap;!unit;!bot;!over;!]</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>In False, a name leaves itself on the stack. ; takes a
name and leaves the value of the name on the stack. ! executes
values.</p>

<p>In addition, F semantics makes it easy for one program to
modify the code of another: invoke the program by name, which
leaves a quotation on the stack, modify the quotation, execute.</p>

<p>In any case, it should be noted that switching F to Joy
semantics is a trivial matter. The <em>c</em> function takes the
value of a defined symbol <em>z</em>, the stack <em>x</em>, and
the queue <em>y</em> and appends it to the stack:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>(x,,z;y)</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>For Joy, we change this to:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>(x;z,y)</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>which prepends the <em>contents</em> of <em>z</em> to the <em>queue</em>.
Subsequent processing will evaluate elements of the value
one-by-one.</p>

<p>It is important to note that in both dialects, some primitives
have names. For example, <em>in</em> is a primitive system function, so:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>F&gt;10 [2 3 4 10 12 2] in
1</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>is valid code in both Joy and F dialects.</p>

<p>Note: this switch has been implemented in the script for F,
viz. J is 0 for F semantics, 1 for Joy semantics.</p>

<p>Note: The "o" command spells out F programs. In Joy
mode:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>F&gt;'map "o"
[[dup count [] top] dip swap
 [quote uncons dip dup top
  [cons unit eval first swons]
  dipd] 
 do pop pop rev]</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>It is possible to write programs in this way, using the words
defined in the <a href="http://www.nsl.com/k/f/f/f.f">f</a> scripts.</p>

<h3>Program = List = Quotation</h3>

<p>In Joy, a quotation is a list and also a program. All programs
are lists, and vice-versa. Intuitively, there does seem to be a
difference between [1 2 3] and [2 +]. It cannot be that the
former contains "data elements" and the latter a data
element and a function, since numbers are just as much functions
as the + operator. Both 2 and + are functions from stacks to
stacks.</p>

<p>The difference between quotations-as-lists and
quotations-as-programs reduces to this: a quotation is list-like
when we want to examine or manipulate its parts or structure; and
a quotation is program-like when want to execute it. So the same
object can appear list-like in certain contexts and program-like
in others. Indeed, it can appear to be neither if we are merely
pushing it onto the stack without regard to its structure or
execution-properties, or both if we first manipulate contents and
structure and then execute it.</p>

<h3>Valence and Charge</h3>

<p>The <em>valence</em> of a program is a pair of integers. The
first element of the pair is the <em>stack-valence</em>. The
stack-valence of a program is the number of elements it takes
from the stack. The second element is the <em>queue-valence</em>.
The queue-valence is the number of elements it takes from the
queue. </p>

<p>The <em>quote</em> operator ' is the only primitive having
non-zero queue-valence: it expects to find one element on the
queue, which it enlists and pushes onto the stack. Hence, <em>quote</em>
has stack-valence 1.</p>

<p>The + operator has stack-valence 2. It takes two elements from
the stack and pushes the sum onto the stack.</p>

<p>The <em>charge</em> of a program is also a pair of integers.
The first element is the <em>stack-charge</em>, and the second is
the <em>queue-charge</em>. </p>

<p>+ has stack-charge 1 (it pushes a single element onto the
stack) and queue-charge 0. <em>dup</em> has stack-valence 1 and
stack-charge 2. <em>swap</em> has stack-valence 2 and
stack-charge 2.</p>

<p>! (<em>unquote</em>) has stack-valence 1 and infinite
queue-charge: it takes a quotation off the stack and pushes as
many elements onto the queue as there are in the quotation.</p>

<p>` (<em>dip</em>) has stack-valence 2 and infinite
queue-charge: it takes two things off the stack: a quotation and
an element X and pushes first X, and then the quotation onto the
queue.</p>

<p>All primitives have non-negative charge and valence. A
negative value means that the program operates on the <em>bottom</em>
of the stack or queue.</p>

<p>If the stack has fewer elements than the (absolute value of
the) stack-valence, an <em>F stack</em> error is signalled. If
the queue has fewer elements than the (absolute value of the)
queue-valence, an <em>F queue</em> error is signalled.</p>

<h3>XY operators: Stack, Unstack, Queue, Unqueue</h3>

<p>F implements four <a href="http://www.nsl.com/k/xy/xy.htm">XY</a> operators:</p>

<p>The <em>stack</em> program takes the stack, enlists it, and
appends it to the stack:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>F&gt;1 2 3 stack!
1 2 3 [1 2 3]</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The <em>unstack</em> program expects a quotation <em>q</em> at
the top of the stack, and sets the stack to the contents of <em>q</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>F&gt;1 2 3 [4 5 6] unstack!
4 5 6</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The <em>queue</em> program expects a quotation at the top of
the stack, and appends it to the end of the queue:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>F&gt;1 2 3 [4 5 6] queue! 7 8 9
1 2 3 7 8 9 [4 5 6]</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The <em>unqueue</em> program expects a quotation at the end of
the queue, and pushes it onto the stack:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>F&gt;1 2 3 unqueue! 4 5 6 [7 8 9]
1 2 3 [7 8 9] 4 5 6</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The XY programs have valence and charge:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>operator	stack-valence	stack-charge	queue-valence	queue-charge
--------	-------------	------------	-------------	------------
stack		inf		1		0		0
unstack		1		inf		0		0
queue		1		0		0		-1
unqueue		0		1		-1		0</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The implementation of $ is one of two primitives which
recursively calls the F evaluator <em>e</em>. $ is a K function
which takes <em>x</em>, the environment, <em>y</em>, the stack,
and <em>z</em>, the queue, and is defined:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>{x,e[x;(-1_ y;z);*-1#y]1}</pre>
</blockquote>

<h3>Infra, Index, Monad, Dyad</h3>

<p>The implementation of . is the other primitive which
recursively calls the F evaluator <em>e</em>. </p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>m:{:[1=#y           ;e[x;();*y]1                                  / infra
     2=#y           ;(*y). e[x;();y 1]1                           / index
     (4:*y)_in 4 6  ;'"G nonce: ."                                / no assignment
     3=#y           ;.@[y;2;{{*-1#e[*x;y,();x 1]1}[(x;y)]}[x]]    / monad
                     .@[y;2;{{*-1#e[*x;y,,z;x 1]1}[(x;y)]}[x]]]}  / dyad</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>where <em>y</em> is the quotation on top of the stack and <em>x</em>
is the environment.</p>

<p>Assignment to globals (*y a symbol) or null (*y null) is blocked.</p>

<p>For example, if the expression to be evaluated is</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>[[10 20 30][[0 1]]] .</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>then the count of <em>y</em> is 2. <em>m</em> indexes the
first element of y, which is 10 20 30, by the value of the second
element of y in the environment x, which is ,0 1.</p>

<h3>Patterns and Shuffles</h3>

<p>F incorporates a version of the pattern sublanguage of <a href="http://www.nsl.com/k/xy/xy.htm">XY</a>.</p>

<p>A <em>pattern</em> is a list whose head is a scheme and whose
tail is a template</p>

<p>A <em>scheme</em> is a name or a list of schemes. The case of
the first letter in a name is significant. If lower-case, the
name matches a single element. If upper-case, the name must occur
as the final element in a list of schemes, and will match zero or
more elements, viz. the remainder of the list whose initial
elements are matched by schemes preceding the terminal name.</p>

<p>A <em>template</em> is a list. If <em>s</em> is a symbol in
the template which also occurs in the scheme, the value matched
by <em>s</em> is substituted for <em>s</em> in the template.</p>

<p>F contains four primitive operations on patterns:</p>

<blockquote><pre>)       Applies a pattern to the stack and pushes the result onto the stack.

(       Applies a pattern to the stack and prepends the result to the queue.

}       Applies a pattern to the queue and pushes the result onto the stack.

{       Applies a pattern to the queue and prepends the result to the queue.</pre></blockquote>

<p>Although F supports the <em>dip</em> combinator as a primitive,
it is possible to define it as a pattern:</p>

<blockquote><pre>F&gt;[[[f a]f!a](] pdip
F&gt;10 20 5 pdip!
30 5
</pre></blockquote>

<p>As an example of how patterns can simplify programming in F,
compare the definition of <em>cond</em> as given in the prelude:</p>

<blockquote><pre>[pair![dupd!]dip!quote!!dip!swap!false!pair!index!!]        cond
</pre></blockquote>

<p>with an equivalent definition using the stack-to-queue operator
(:</p>

<blockquote><pre>[[[d i t f]d[[t f]]d i!false!join!index!!](]                pcond
</pre></blockquote>

<p><em>pcond</em> expects a data-item <em>d</em>, a condition <em>i</em> of <em>d</em>, 
a program <em>t</em> to evaluate on <em>d</em> if <em>d i</em> is true (i.e. not false),
and a program <em>f</em> to evaluate on <em>d</em> if <em>d i</em> is false.</p>

<p>The template evaluates the condition and uses the result to index out
the appropriate program, which is then evaluated on the data-item.</p>

<p>The extent to which patterns can be used to avoid list construction and
deconstruction can be seen in this version, in which the template is used
to create a diagram of the penultimate structure.  <em>infra</em> evaluates
the quotation, <em>index</em> selects the right piece of the result, which
is then evaluated on the data-item:</p>

<blockquote><pre>[[[d i t f]d[[[t f]d i!false!]]infra!index!!](]             qcond
</pre></blockquote>

<p>The pattern versions are arguably clearer than the version which
makes use of stack operators.  One objection to the use of patterns is that
the resulting programs violate the Concatenativity property: a concatenative
program can be cut into two sub-programs, both of which are concatenative
programs, as long as the cut does not fall within the boundaries of a 
quotation.  For example, <em>cond</em> can be cut into:</p>

<blockquote><pre>[pair![dupd!]dip!quote!!dip!]                               acond
[swap!false!pair!index!!]                                   bcond
</pre></blockquote>

<p>and then <em>cond</em> can be defined as:

</p><blockquote><pre>[acond!bcond!]                                              abcond
</pre></blockquote>

<p>But <em>pcond</em> cannot be cut into smaller programs, because every
pattern-based program has the structure <em>[[[scheme] template] operator]</em>.
The only point available for the cut is between the pattern and the operator.
This is a consequence of the fact that the meaning of symbols in the pattern-template 
depends on the assignments implied by the pattern-scheme.</p>

<p>F also supports <em>shuffle-symbols</em>, a simplified, weaker
version of ). For example, <em>swap</em> is:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>F&gt;10 20 ab-ba
20 10</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Shuffles can reduce stack-noise, but the resulting programs still
have the Concatenativity property.  For example, <em>cond</em> can be defined
as:</p>

<blockquote><pre>[ditf-dditf pair!unit!quote!!dip!swap!false!join!index!!]   scond
</pre></blockquote>

<p>A potentially fruitful approach to program construction would require that 
all programs be defined as alternating pairs of shuffles and stack-manipulation-free
stretches of functional code.  For example,</p><blockquote><pre>[ab-bab     +*
 abc-bcca   -|,.]</pre></blockquote>
 
<p>In such programs, one would never find on the right-hand side
programs such as <em>pop</em> or <em>swap</em>.</p>

<p>Note: This material has benefited greatly from discussions
with William Tanksley, Jr.</p>

<h2>7. Notes</h2>

<p>F began as an exercise in extending Wouter van Oormerssen's concatenative language <a href="http://www.nsl.com/papers/false.htm">False</a>, but it rapidly acquired a life of its own.  At
this point, little trace remains of the original.</p>

<p>See Randall Holmes' functional extensions to False, <a href="http://math.boisestate.edu/~holmes/holmes/sfdocs.pdf">Strictly
False</a>, which stimulated the present project.</p>

<p>An earlier version of F with primitive stack and list operations
and a somewhat different mapping of primitives to symbols is <a href="http://www.nsl.com/k/f_obsolete/f.htm">here</a>.</p>

<p>Welcome to the latest edition of my on-going series in Cray-related computational necromancy. This was another just-for-fun project. Over the many years Andras and I have been working on our Cray revival efforts, there has always been a big lag between our available software (and <a href="https://www.modularcircuits.com/blog/articles/the-cray-files/">Andras’ amazing simulator</a>) and my FPGA-compatible Verilog implementation. My free time and interests have oscillated wildly over the years, and implementing and debugging hardware is generally everything-intensive. My original cycle-accurate (but buggy) Cray-1 RTL gradually morphed first into a binary-compatible, but less-accurate Cray X-MP (which is mostly just a Cray-1 with 24-bit addresses instead of 22-bit), and finally into a binary-compatible and not-at-all cycle-accurate Cray Y-MP/C90/J90 core (which is mostly just a Cray-1 with 32-bit addresses). During the final transition, it got a full re-write in System Verilog and a vast simplification in the hopes I’ll someday actually be able to boot up UNICOS on it. That hasn’t quite happened yet, but it’s far enough along that I felt it was ready to play around with and make it into a ‘real’ project. What to do with this? A Cray Wristwatch, of course!</p>



<p>A benefit of the extremely slow pace and long duration of my Cray-related work is the ongoing march of Moore’s law in the background. Very capable FPGA boards are now cheaper and smaller, and it seemed time to give another scale model Cray Supercomputer a shot. As I mentioned, this one isn’t quite as cycle-accurate (or CPU-count accurate), but I’m still quite happy with how it turned out. </p>



<h3>But . . . Why??</h3>



<p>I had a tiny Cray supercomputer and a round OLED display just looking for a project, and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cray_C90">Cray C916</a> just happens to be the right shape for the supercomputer wristwatch you’ve always dreamed about. If you wanted something practical, go read someone else’s blog.</p>



<h3>How is this different from the Cray-1?</h3>



<p>The Cray “Parallel Vector Processor” (PVP) line that extended from the Cray-1A in 1976 all the way to the final <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cray_X1">Cray X1E</a> in 2005 really did maintain quite a bit of compatibility. The main differences between them were the extension from 22 address bits with the original Cray-1 to 24 bits with the X-MP and 32 bits with the X-MP/EA and Y-MP machines. As Cray PVP machines are only 64-bit word addressable (bytes? what are those?), 32-bit addresses give you access to a respectable 32 gigabytes of memory. </p>



<p>Later machines also switched from 64-bit “Cray” floating point to IEEE double-precision 64-bit floating point and added a ‘bit matrix multiply’ functional unit, but aside from that there were architecturally few differences across ~30 years of development. So programming my Cray J90 core is pretty much identical to the Cray-1, ignoring the address widths (this means the actual Address Registers were extended from 24 bits on the Cray-1 to 32-bits in my J90 core). </p>



<p>This was a from-scratch re-write with the intent of it being both debuggable and maintainable by me though, so I changed quite a few of the micro-architectural details with those goals in mind. Vector chaining is gone, the vector registers are now implemented in a big 2R1W SRAM, and the instruction cache maps much more nicely to the available block RAMs in my FPGA. Generally cleaner, simpler, and a little slower (but I did manage to get the clock all the way up to the 105 MHz that the real J90 ran at!). </p>



<h3>System Architecture</h3>



<p>The heart of the system is a <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/cmod-a7-breadboardable-artix-7-fpga-module/">Diligent CMOD-A7 FPGA board</a>. The FPGA contains the Cray CPU core running at a respectable 105 MHz (actually matching the clock speed of the J90, although still fairly far from the 244 MHz of the real C90), a few KW of SRAM and a pair of DMA channels connected to a SPI interface via FIFOs. A Teensy 3.6 microcontroller serves as the ‘Front-End’ processor, and controls the reset signals and the SPI interface going to the J90. It also drives a neato circular OLED display I picked up (the previous generation of <a href="https://4dsystems.com.au/products/featured-products/pixxilcd-13p2">this one</a>, I think). In practice, the Teensy dead-starts the J90 by initializing its memory via SPI and taking it out of reset, and then it just dumps frames of data from the J90 DMA engine, converts them to an appropriately formatted image and dumps them to the display.</p>



<h3>Software</h3>



<p>My work with supercomputers both modern and historical has made me quite fond of N-body gravity simulations – to show off the vector prowess of my J90 core, my wristwatch runs a full n-body simulation of Jupiter and 63 of its moons. That’s right! Each body gravitationally interacts with all 63 other bodies. Remarkably, through effective use of vector registers, the whole simulation requires only 127 carefully-chosen instructions, and is able to sustain 40 MFLOPS!</p>



<p>As I still don’t really have a proper development environment, I first wrote my program in Python using some simple primitives mimicking the Cray vector instructions. I then modified that to spit out some simple machine code, and ran it on my RTL simulator verify that nothing blew up numerically. At that point I was able to boot it on the real FPGA board and run it for a few hours to verify the stability.</p>

<h3>But how do you tell the time?</h3>



<p>With great difficulty. The display shows a free-running simulation of Jupiter and 63 of its moons. For convenience, I just plot the X/Y coordinates of each moon in the ecliptic plane. The ephemerides come from the <a href="https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons.cgi">HORIZONS</a> server that NASA operates, at a specified date and time. The J90 just dumps a new frame whenever the Teensy has pulled the previous one, so with a <em>teensy</em> (ha!) bit of calibration on the micro controller side, it would be pretty easy to have the frames dumped in ‘real time’, which, knowing the starting time and date, would allow you to not-at-all-easily infer the current time by looking at the positions of Jupiter’s moons. Which is exactly what I was going for with my Supercomputer Wristwatch – using it should be as incomprehensible as my motivation for creating it in the first place!</p>



<h3>Why a C90?</h3>

<p>Although it does maintain binary compatibility, the real Cray Y-MP C916 was a 244 MHz, 16-CPU monster – my 1/25-scale version is a mere single-CPU running at 105 MHz (and lacks other performance enhancements like dual-issue vector pipelines) . . . this model was mostly chosen because of the convenient circular dome in the middle that could hold my nifty OLED watch face. </p>



<p>I designed the model and built it with a 3D printer, carefully trimmed my circuit boards to fit, mounted the display, and still had enough room for a battery left over. </p>



<h2>The Final Product</h2>



<p>I love how this project turned out – it’s adorable, it’s programmable, and it pushes the boundaries of uselessness and complexity. The final case can accommodate a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watch_strap">NATO-style wrist strap </a> and has a built-in battery charger, but in practice it makes a better desk novelty than a watch. </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Early websites.</strong> In the beginning, website HTML was crafted by
hand. Your average personal — or corporate — website might consist of
hand-edited HTML subsequently uploaded, probably via FTP, to a web server which
knew only how to serve static files.</p>
<p>Since web pages in a set often include shared elements like headers and
footers, maintaining this was obviously troublesome. I have no doubt each and
every person charged with maintaining such a website found their own solutions.
Maybe they wrote simple Perl scripts to generate pages with common headers. If
they weren't programmers, maybe they used some tool like Frontpage, Dreamweaver
or Hotdog that (possibly) offered some useful functionality in this regard.
Or maybe they just stuck it out and edited every page manually when they wanted
to change the header or footer. You might think that sounds nuts, but I'm fairly
sure it was quite common.</p>
<p>At some point “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Side_Includes">Server Side
Includes</a>” (SSI) came
along, offering extremely basic file inclusion functionality to allow common
headers and footers.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface">CGI</a> was developed,
allowing web pages to be produced from dynamic scripts. While groundbreaking
for enabling dynamic web applications, I got the impression most ordinary
websites did not make use of it for serving pages. Many web servers required or
at least recommended CGI scripts to be placed in a special <code>cgi-bin</code> directory,
making URLs rather cumbersome. One major CGI application was the blogging
platform Movable Type, which featured a CGI and Perl-based administration
webapp which automatically regenerated static files from a database whenever
changes were made.</p>
<p><strong>Rise of PHP.</strong> What was really significant however was the explosion in
popularity of PHP. A great deal has been written about PHP, much of it
negative, but there are some interesting attributes of PHP to note which are
relevant here:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>PHP has the world's simplest deployment model for web applications: copy
some files to a directory. This deployment model is so simple, and so
intuitively understandable, that almost anyone capable of using an FTP
client (the existing market of people making their own homepages, in other
words) could deploy a PHP application.</p>
<p>Of course, PHP inherited this particular attribute from CGI, but without
the cumbersome special <code>cgi-bin</code> directory which was often (though not
always) required, and often with greater performance. The lack of shebang
lines probably also reduced compatibility issues people faced trying to
transfer CGI scripts from Windows to Unix environments or vice versa.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Because PHP originated as a templating language, the initial behaviour of a
PHP file is simply to print its contents. This means, in turn, that you can
just “dip in and out” of PHP as you need it. Compare this in turn with even
the simplest Perl or Python CGI script. For the latter, you're writing a
program which outputs HTML; with PHP, you're writing HTML with some
occasionally interwoven code. If a particular page doesn't need to do
anything dynamic, it needn't contain any code at all.</p>
</li>
<li><p>PHP scripts don't consume any resources (persistent processes, etc.) when
they're not being used.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Even more interestingly, these two attributes combined to create something
very special in PHP<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fn1b">1</a></sup>: support for the “hackish state”, an environment optimal
for casual tinkering with server-side scripting — without having to bring out a
whole framework and take the time to set it up. If you had an idea for some
kind of dynamic, server-side behaviour, you could probably have it prototyped
in PHP in 15 minutes. It might be crude, but it would be real. But the “hackish
state” of web development that PHP supported went beyond this in a way that,
having experienced it, I find hard to describe; perhaps the closest analogy is
environments designed to enable programmatic art, like the interesting recent
development of live music programming environments. You could call it a kind of
<em>jamming</em>. Though there are countless server-side web frameworks, PHP is
uniquely adapted to do server-side development in a <em>jamming</em> state of mind.</p>
<p>Of course, this doesn't mean that what you produce in such a state is going to
be something robust, maintainable, or something you want to use in production.
But these requirements can be solved later, after the initial prototyping and a
period of uninhibited, spontaneous creativity; just as a great illustration
might be preceded by, and necessarily flow from, rough concept art and pencil
sketches.</p>
<p><strong>The mildly dynamic website.</strong> PHP enabled dynamic web applications for the masses. But an interesting and
particular effect of the rise of PHP was that it enabled and led to the rise of
what I'm going to call “mildly dynamic” websites.</p>
<p>Broadly, these are websites which are still <em>web pages</em>, not <em>web
applications</em>; they're pages of essentially static information, personal
websites, blogs, and so on, but they are <em>slightly</em> dynamic. They might have a
style selector at the top of each page, causing a cookie to be set, and the
server to serve a different stylesheet on every subsequent page load. Perhaps
there is a random quote of the day at the bottom of each payload. Perhaps each
page has a comments section. Perhaps each page load shows a different, randomly
chosen header image. Anyone remember <em>shoutboxes</em>?</p>
<p>Of course, this is all minor functionality, with the possible exception of
comments sections. It's not a <em>big deal</em>. Still, these random details gave a
certain character and individuality to websites of this era that is hard to
find today. They were, inimitably, the product of <em>jamming</em>. (Many use the term
“indieweb” today in reaction to their own perceptions of a change in the
character of the web from how they once remembered it; these random details are
one such part of my own memories.)</p>
<p>(As an aside, WordPress and similar PHP blogging platforms are probably the principal
exception to the static site trend here. These are a mixed bag; while on the
one hand, they're still oriented towards publishing static content, they do
offer <em>mildly dynamic</em> functionality like comments systems. On the other hand,
they're not really oriented towards adding your own <em>mildly dynamic</em>
functionality. Though of course you can add custom functionality with plugins,
they're not really an environment that encourages jamming, or, say, embedding
dynamicity inside a blog post right then and there. Others have noted that the
rise of blogging platforms such as these led to a greater uniformity in
websites, because of the rigid publishing paradigm of chronologically ordered
blog posts they imposed on those who use them. You can go against the flow and
fight the system, of course, but this takes effort, and most won't, so the
net result is that websites become oddly samey.)</p>
<p><strong>The dynamicity gap.</strong> Eventually, the era of PHP websites passed and <em>static
site generators</em> became the new fad. Everything old is new again! First you had
people who made static websites discovering dynamic websites, and then you had
people who made dynamic websites discovering static websites. A consequence of
this, however, has been the demise of the mildly dynamic website.</p>
<p>In short, here's the problem: the mildly dynamic functionality I mention above
is too minor to be worth bringing in a web application framework, and spawning
and maintaining persistent processes just to serve a website.</p>
<p>Or, to put it another way:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://www.devever.net/~hl/img/php-efforto.svg" alt="[Graph of two lines. The X-axis is labeled “Dynamicity” and the Y-axis is labeled “Effort”. The first line, which is dashed and labeled “PHP”, starts at the origin at the bottom left and rises linearly in a straight line to the right. The second line, which is solid and labeled “Framework”, starts at the bottom left and moves to the right slightly, but then moves straight up in a vertical line only slightly into the X-axis, and plateaus as a flat horizontal line at the top of the Y-axis for the remainder of the X-axis.]">
</figure>



<p>You can read the “Effort” axis as whatever you like here; size, complexity,
resource consumption, maintenance burden. What PHP offered is an increase in
this effort proportional to the amount of dynamicity to be added to a website.
This is something no framework can do (and I include PHP frameworks in this<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fn2b">2</a></sup>).
If you have a static website and you want to make it dynamic and you don't use
PHP, pretty much all options available to you imply a massive increase in complexity
that must be paid up front before you can do anything at all. You bring in a massive
framework for the dynamic equivalent of “Hello World”, and then on top of that
(if it's a non-PHP framework, meaning persistent processes are probably
involved) the process for deploying your website radically changes and becomes
far more complex.</p>
<p>It's not surprising at all, therefore, that people tend not to do this nowadays.</p>
<p>This in turn has led to much of the functionality which might have previously
been implemented on the server side on a “mildly dynamic” website being moved
to JavaScript. A blog is generated by a static site generator, but then how
does one support comments? Answer: Specialist third-party services like Disqus
come into existence. Now, you can have comments on your website just by adding
a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag, and not have to traverse the painful vertical line of making
your website itself even slightly dynamic. This has driven increased dependence
on third party services; dynamicity itself becomes something to be outsourced.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, this is what we lost when we moved beyond PHP. Nowadays, we have
an abundance of frameworks for web applications to choose from; yet PHP remains
is the only server-side technology really offering a linear increase in effort
for a linear increase in dynamicity if you are starting at zero. We probably
shouldn't be surprised, therefore, by the trend of moving everything to
client-side JavaScript. You see, client-side JavaScript shares something in
common with PHP: it plots the same line on the graph above. It is, besides PHP,
the other compelling technology for <em>mildly dynamic</em> websites, because you can
start using as little JavaScript as you like without paying an upfront cost in
frameworks and infrastructure.</p>
<p>Suppose you are writing an article about some concept and you want to put some
special dynamic widget in the middle of the article, which people can play with
to gain an understanding of the concept. This is just one article you're
writing, one of countless others; you're not going to spin up an application
server (and maintain it indefinitely) just for this throwaway toy widget. The
only reasonable implementation options are JavaScript and PHP. This support for
<em>jamming</em> is something these two languages have in common, and should be seen
as a positive attribute, yet is rarely mentioned.</p>
<p>Or, suppose a company makes a webpage for looking up products by their model
number. If this page were made in 2005, it would probably be a single PHP page.
It doesn't need a framework — it's one SELECT query, that's it. If this page
were made in 2022, a conundrum will be faced: the company probably chose to use
a statically generated website. The total number of products isn't <em>too</em> large,
so instead their developers stuff a gigantic JSON file of model numbers for
every product made by the company on the website and add some client-side
JavaScript to download and query it. This increases download sizes and makes
things slower, but at least you didn't have to spin up and maintain a new
application server. This example is fictitious but I believe it to be
representative. There's little room for <em>mildly dynamic</em> functionality in the
modern ecosystem of static site generators and kitchen-sink process-based web
frameworks. I might call this the <em>dynamicity gap</em>.</p>
<p>It's a common refrain that the adoption of technology in the web development
space seems to be excessively fad driven. In the last decade we have seen a
completely misguided move to “Single Page Apps”, which break completely without
JavaScript. It's the fad, you see. Yet now the new fad is “Server Side
Rendering”; the notion that (amazing, I know) one actually generates web pages
on the server — and serves them to the client! From the way people talk about
this you would think this concept has never been introduced to them before and
is completely novel to them. The sad thing is, it may well be the case. It's
long been fairly apparent to me that the average modern web developer has no
comprehension of what the web actually is<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fn3b">3</a></sup>. The web seems to be hostage to a
<a href="https://www.jwz.org/doc/cadt.html">CADT</a> development model in which, periodically, everything old becomes new
and everything new becomes old, as the old, forgotten way of doing things
becomes sufficiently forgotten that when rediscovered, it suddenly becomes new
and shiny. Perhaps “the grass is always greener” also applies to static vs.
dynamic websites, and to client-side vs. server-side. It's possible we will see
the fad pendulum swing back toward server-side; though the <em>dynamicity gap</em>
suggests that if this does happen, it will probably be constrained to full-fat
web applications, not (barring a sudden return to PHP) ordinary websites.</p>
<p><strong>AWS Lambda: CGI But It's Trendy.</strong>  Recently we've seen the rise in popularity of
AWS Lambda, a “functions as a service” provider. From my perspective this is
literally a reinvention of CGI, except a) much more complicated for essentially
the same functionality, b) with vendor lock-in, c) with a much more complex and
bespoke deployment process which requires the use of special tools.</p>
<p>What captured people's imaginations about AWS Lambda is that it lets you a)
give any piece of code an URL, and b) that code doesn't consume resources when
it's not being used. Yet these are also exactly the attributes possessed by PHP
or CGI scripts. In fact, it's far easier for me to write a PHP script and
<code>rsync</code> it to a web server of mine than for me to figure out the extensive and
complex tooling for creating, maintaining and deploying AWS Lambda functions —
and it comes without the lock-in to boot. Moreover, the former allows me to
give an URL to a piece of code instantly, whereas with the latter I have to
figure out how to setup AWS API Gateway plumbing correctly. I'm genuinely
curious how many people find AWS Lambda interesting because they've never
encountered, or never properly looked at, CGI.</p>
<p>Of course, it's fair to say if Lambda does offer anything that PHP/CGI doesn't
it is high availability. That's something you can't say about a solitary PHP
server. But it's not as though it's infeasible to create a highly available PHP
cluster either — and I can still deploy a script and give it an URL in 30
seconds with nought but <code>rsync</code>. Moreover, the average server is reliable
enough that a lack of HA just doesn't seem to matter in many circumstances.
This is especially true when one is talking about niche dynamic functionality
which is only occasionally used. These are often the same circumstances where
Lambda might be used — things called rarely enough it's not worth keeping a
daemon spun up. The PHP websites I've published have never been highly
available and I've never lost sleep over that; the ability to just give a piece
of code an URL in 30 seconds, without complex deployment tooling, proprietary
APIs or vendor lock-in seems to me a lot more valuable for the things I do.</p>
<p><strong>Future directions.</strong> It seems like more technologies which plug the
<em>dynamicity gap</em> on the server-side — languages like PHP — would be valuable.
The CGI/PHP deployment and execution model clearly excites people as
demonstrated by the popularity of AWS Lambda, yet we still see relatively
little new development in this space; the ability to dip in and out of code in
web pages to offer <em>mildly dynamic</em> functionality on the server side without
frameworks is empowering yet is largely offered by PHP alone. For that matter,
the popularity of WordPress is probably in part because, being written in PHP,
it inherits these advantages in turn.</p>
<p>Theoretically, there are many plugins for webservers adding support for
scripting using any scripting language you can name. These are sometimes used
to host full-blown web applications but I don't see them being used to
facilitate <em>mildly dynamic</em> functionality. <code>mod_perl</code> and <code>mod_lua</code>, for
example, don't really offer any kind of functionality allowing you to dip and
out of Perl/Lua code inside HTML. <code>mod_python</code> does offer “Python Server Pages”
which does support this using an ASP-like syntax, but it seems rarely used.
Moreover it seems largely replaced by <code>mod_wsgi</code>, which provides no comparable
functionality.</p>
<p>This website is statically generated by a ~700-line Node.js script which I
wrote specifically for the purpose. I considered using an off-the-shelf static
site generator but ultimately, since I knew exactly what output I wanted, I
concluded it would take more effort to wrestle any such tool into doing exactly
what I want than to just write my own tool. I'm idly pondering bringing PHP
back into the mix, however — so that I can make it <em>mildly dynamic</em>, and offer
things like comments once more.</p>


<hr>
<p>1. Let us not speak of Coldfusion.
<a href="#fn1b">⏎</a></p>

<p>2. I should note that when I talk
about PHP in this article, I'm really talking about PHP how it was used in the
beginning, as essentially a template language with scripting you can “dip in
and out of” as you need it. Modern PHP has shifted its emphasis greatly, to a
more structured object oriented language with namespaces and class
autoloaders, with PHP itself rarely being used for templating. These approaches
are sufficiently different that they may as well be  different languages for
how they feel to use. The former admits experimentation, prototyping,
spontaneity and jamming. The latter is trying to clean up its act and probably
in part driven by a desire to improve the reputation of PHP as a serious and
reliable tool for developing complex web applications. This is a good thing,
but comes with the inevitable weight and structure imposed by frameworks. I
suspect even many who start to use PHP never actually learn of or try out
“bare” PHP, and thus never come to learn of its incredible support for
experimentation and the “hackish state.” <a href="#fn2b">⏎</a></p>

<p>3. Namely, a hypertext semantic
document platform, as opposed to say, an applications platform. The HTML5 coup
is representative of this shift in attitude, <a href="https://www.devever.net/~hl/xhtml2">as I've written
about previously</a>. <a href="#fn3b">⏎</a></p>

I began tweeting about Lambda School in 2019, and the more I tweeted, the more students shared messages like this:</p><blockquote>Hi Ben I just wanted to say thank you for your effort in exposing Lambda School. I was a student there and had a terrible experience. I dropped out last year (still on the hook for the 30k ISA) and since have been avoiding reading anything related to the school for my mental health. It sucks so bad that they are getting away with all of this, especially when the students are mostly minority or people who are in vulnerable positions</blockquote><p>Lambda School targeted single mothers, the disabled, reformed convicts, and people struggling with serious medical problems. They lost tens of thousands of dollars, some lost <em>years</em> of their lives, on a broken, predatory program.</p><p>When students surfaced problems to staff, staff blamed the victims, gaslighting them with, "Trust the process," or blaming everything on "imposter syndrome." As the company unraveled, upset students overran the official /r/LambdaSchool subreddit with criticism. As Austen deleted posts, students created a rogue Discord to discuss legal options. Austen tried to contain things by pretending to be a student under a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sock_puppet_account?ref=sandofsky.com" rel="noreferrer">sock puppet</a> account.</p><figure><img src="https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/2024/04/impersonating-a-former-student.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1795" height="674" srcset="https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/impersonating-a-former-student.jpeg 600w, https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/04/impersonating-a-former-student.jpeg 1000w, https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/04/impersonating-a-former-student.jpeg 1600w, https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/2024/04/impersonating-a-former-student.jpeg 1795w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>His effort's to save his subreddit proved hopeless, and so he set it to private.

A single mother who signed up for Lambda School based on false job placement rates, Emily thought it would change her life, only to be saddled with a $30,000 debt. Emily was in luck, because Lambda School forgot to make her sign away her rights to sue. Her case was taken up by a non-profit legal organization that stands up for student taken in by predatory, for-profit schools.</p><p>After a long legal battle, Lambda School finally settled out of court, but Emily wasn't there to celebrate.

How did it rise so fast and unravel even faster? We need to back up and replay Lambda School's collapse, in slow motion. It starts with the mystery of why venture capitalists handed over so much money.</p><p>The rise of the 2010's tech bubble saw an explosion of tech jobs paying six figures. Just as most of the money in a gold rush goes to shovel salesmen, people who can't land high-paying jobs in tech sell training.

Back in the 1980s, the state was the "Diploma Mill Capital of the World," and in response, they established a bureau to regulate for-profit schools called the <a href="https://bppe.ca.gov/?ref=sandofsky.com" rel="noreferrer">BPPE</a>. This bureau had nothing to do with accreditation. They didn't care if you ran a flat-earth school, they just want to make sure that you didn't go out there claiming 90% of graduates get jobs as sea captains.</p><p>The BPPE went to work reigning in the flood of sketchy bootcamps, and by 2017, the combination of BPPE penalties, negative press, and general word of mouth gave "code bootcamp" carried the same sullied reputation as <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/refunds/devry-refunds?ref=sandofsky.com" rel="noreferrer">DeVry</a> or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/25/arts/design/art-institutes-closures.html?ref=sandofsky.com" rel="noreferrer">The Art Institute</a>.</p><p>As just another bootcamp late to the fad, Lambda School didn't stand a chance, but this was back in 2017, but common sense didn't apply to VC backed startups during that wild time when WeWork was worth twenty billion dollars.

Bootcamps and mildly successful eBooks are small-potato endeavors that VCs label <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_business?ref=sandofsky.com" rel="noreferrer">"lifestyle business"</a>. It takes very different skills to build a billion dollar company, and Austen was a mere carnival barker.</p><p>I think VC were blinded by ideology. Silicon Valley leans libertarian, with part-time <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/blog/welcome-peter?ref=sandofsky.com" rel="noreferrer">Y Combinator partner</a> Peter Thiel bemoaning college and offering $100,000 to entrepreneurs willing to skip it to build a startup. Thiel's donation of $1.25M to Trump's 2016 campaign, along with a rousing endorsement at the Republican National Convention, finally created enough backlash to cause the firm to sever ties.</p><p>Y Combinator's founder, Paul Graham, sits so adjacent to Thiel that Graham even asks him to review his blog posts. Graham is type of guy who thinks his early investment in DoorDash was a good thing for the world.</p><figure><img src="https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/2024/04/IMG_E2C77BBE843A-1.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1290" height="549" srcset="https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/IMG_E2C77BBE843A-1.jpeg 600w, https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/04/IMG_E2C77BBE843A-1.jpeg 1000w, https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/2024/04/IMG_E2C77BBE843A-1.jpeg 1290w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Austen pitched investors that the <em>real</em> problem in higher education is how schools make money regardless of whether or not you get a job. If schools only got paid when a student makes money, there's "Incentive Alignment." VCs like Graham fell for it because if all you know is capitalism, everything looks like a free-market problem.</p><p>In many ways, Lambda School mirrored the model of venture capital. Firms bet on a large batches of companies, and the money from the big successes make up for the flops.

Students got a taste of programming, but when it came to getting hired, neither the training nor credentials held a candle to a college degree.

Austen claimed the program striped out the non-programming portions of a computer science degree, but even after they expanded the program from six to nine months, the number of hours don't work out.</p><p>Let's skip the math, physics, and other code-free classes give you a foundational understanding of computers. Let's pretend that all you need from a Computer Science degree are the programming courses. In a reputable CS program, that's around two years of class time. How do you possibly fit that into nine months?</p><p>This ridiculous premise drove me to obtain a copy of the entire student curriculum, to figure out what the hell was going on. I dug into the area of my expertise, iPhone development.</p><figure><img src="https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-21-at-3.17.02-PM.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1720" srcset="https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-21-at-3.17.02-PM.png 600w, https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-21-at-3.17.02-PM.png 1000w, https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-21-at-3.17.02-PM.png 1600w, https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/size/w2400/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-21-at-3.17.02-PM.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>As expected, the curriculum was on par with an average coding boot camp. At best, it spends a few weeks skimming a handful of foundational CS concepts. Most time goes to drilling today's trendy technologies. You're welcome to argue that trendy technologies are the fastest path to an entry-level job, but it's downright fraud to say this matches the depth of a Computer Science degree.</p><p>A class is about much more than the material, so let's consider the teachers. Their marketing claimed instructors, "hail from the top companies and universities in the world." In reality, one iOS instructor had just graduated from a competing boot camp before getting hired, having never spent a day in the industry. The head of the data science program was Austen's brother, Ryan, whose only experience was another bootcamp and internship.</p><p>With cohorts containing upwards of 200 students, you were lucky to get access to teachers at all. To deal with the ridiculous teacher-to-student ratio, the company had a "Team Lead" system, similar to college TAs. They hired the better students in later units to mentor the students in earlier units.</p><p>Because the school encouraged students to publish their homework assignments online for self-promotion, I could dig into how many students struggle. Out of ten homework assignments I reviewed, I found that half contained memory management bugs that would have instantly failed them from the early stages of a job interview.</p><p>I reached out to the students in private to check that I wasn't missing something, and heard back from one. I asked if an instructor had issued him feedback in private. No, I was the first person to point out his bugs. I later found out that Lambda School had hired this struggling student to TA other students.</p><p>This lead to me to contact a hiring manager at a company that had interviewed an entire cohort of Lambda School graduates, only to reject all of them. He explained:</p><blockquote>The issue was that most of the candidates didn't make it past the first two parts of our interview funnel. The first part is a take home challenge, no time limit but really should take like an hour or two to do and many entries just weren't completed or finished. And the second part of our interview is just debugging and a continuation of the take home with white boarding. It seemed like most students weren't fully prepared.</blockquote><hr><p>Many problems stemmed from Lambda School wanting to act more like a startup than a school, constantly experimenting with classes as if it were an early-stage product. That proved chaotic for attendees, as classes could radically change overnight. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40071539&amp;ref=sandofsky.com" rel="noreferrer">According to one student</a>:</p><blockquote>Things seemed fine in the beginning. The instructors were good, and I liked that there were actual live classes. Things degraded very quickly. They kept changing the format and the curriculum ("iterating"). They doubled the length of the program that I was in, which made it impossible for me to even finish it. I was working in a tech support job where we had to do shift bids and no shift was guaranteed. I enrolled in a plan that fit the shift I was working, and the expected end date, and when they changed the program length and format, I couldn't complete it.<p>They promised career guidance, including having a career councilor, but I never got one. They kept telling my cohort we would get our councilors after this or that milestone, but when we got there they would move the goalpost again. The closest we got was a resume course that was not relevant to tech at all and a resume review by another student.</p></blockquote><p>In late 2019, stories circulated about the chaotic, haphazard training, with students likening the school <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/lambda-school-coding-bootcamp-y-combinator-cult-2019-10?ref=sandofsky.com" rel="noreferrer">to a cult</a>. When students mobbed critics on Reddit, staff thanked them on Slack. When students brought up concerns about the training, staff took them aside and explained that they're just suffering from imposter syndrome. They were told that most of programming is just Googling for answers. I'll admit that's sometimes true, but the difference between a $50 Udemy course and a $30,000 boot camp should be human beings that help you through the material. Students felt the same way, but were afraid to push back out of fear of retaliation.</p><p>The school's tactic of gaslighting students couldn't go on forever. In late 2019, the new UX program had become a disaster, a far cry from the program Austen claimed had a "100% hired." As students in the class began talking with one another, they realized everyone realized they had the same issues, and they demanded to be released from their ISAs due to the school's negligence. The company refused, so the students shared their stories <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21131848/lambda-school-coding-bootcamp-isa-tuition-cost-free?ref=sandofsky.com" rel="noreferrer">with The Verge.</a></p><blockquote>Yet, many of the classes in the UX program seemed haphazard and poorly thought out to Nishida and some of his classmates. Once, during a drawing lesson that was ostensibly related to product design, students watched as the teacher sketched on a white sheet of paper. He said he was drawing a town, but the glare on the paper was so bright they couldn’t see what he was doing. When they spoke up, he grabbed a bedsheet and conducted the rest of the lesson under a makeshift curtain. To some, it felt like he hadn’t thought through the lesson — either the content he was presenting or how he was going to present it. “It highlights the unprofessionalism, incompetence, and disorganization of Lambda School’s UX program,” one student wrote in a note to Lambda.</blockquote><p>With a program that bad, how did 100% of graduates in the first UX session get hired? Austen left out that <strong>only one student graduated</strong>. Yes, 1 out of 1 is 100%, and it illustrates how the company lied without <em>technically</em> lying.</p><p>Lambda School's marketing material cherry-picked a handful of success stories, leaving out the vast majority of failures. Of those successes, they left out important details. For example, a woman on the front page of their website has the caption, "went from stay at home mom to a Software Development Engineer at Amazon." They left out that the woman was a professional programmer for seven years prior to motherhood.</p><p>Lambda School was doomed because it couldn't decide who it was for. It marketed itself as a college replacement, but treated the material with the depth of a vocational school. They claimed there were plenty of humble programming jobs outside of Silicon Valley, yet classes wasted time on skills unmarketable outside buzzy tech startups, such as the blockchain.</p><p>The company's few remaining apologists blame its failure on everything from government regulation to companies biased toward college degrees, but make no mistake, the company failed because the program failed. This was supposed to be the point in the story when Income Share Agreements fix everything. Instead, we get to watch what happens when a good idea clashes with reality.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, colleges tried ISAs for years before Lambda School. Why were they abandoned? It seems impossible to construct ISAs in a way that benefits the student without exposing the school to more risk.</p><p>It's expected that programs that offer ISAs will have worse hiring results than those that ask for payment up-front. Apologists blame it on students who attend for free, decide they don't like coding, and drop out because there's no "skin in the game." Maybe that's a thing, but I think it's much more likely that the students who <em>need</em> an ISA, the students barely getting by, face more struggles than the people who can afford to pay up front.</p><p>If a school wants to reduce the risk, they could be more rigorous in admissions, only accepting the students they're sure will pay them back. That means either denying admission to anyone who genuinely needs the ISA, or charging different people different prices based on their risk. If you squint, this looks like an argument for payday loans. If nobody else will service these groups, is it better to offer something at a higher price than to offer nothing at all?</p><p>Push past these ethical quandaries and we get to the technical problems. How do you prove that the school did its job? If a student majors in math and finds a job in programming, does that count? What happens if the student gets hired, but gets laid off a month later?</p><p>As you go down this path, you speed-run the student loan system, reinventing concepts like <a href="https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/lower-payments/get-temporary-relief/deferment?ref=sandofsky.com" rel="noreferrer">hardship-deferments</a> and <a href="https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/repayment/plans/income-driven?ref=sandofsky.com" rel="noreferrer">income-driven repayment forgiveness</a>. We should absolutely overhaul American education, but if we want to make lives better for millions of indebted students as quickly as possible, the fastest pain relief would come from better educating people on existing escape hatches.</p><p>Going back to ISAs, let's focus on the thorniest clause of the contract: "You pay nothing if you don't find a job in a related field within <em>X</em> years." What is a fair value for X? If you pick 'one year,' students may take on an unrelated job just to run down their clock. The longer you pick for the length, the more it benefits scammers.</p><p>For a clever scammer, ISAs offer a smoke screen. As early warning signs about Lambda School popped up, critics were met with, "How can it be a scam? You only pay when you get a job!" If the company stayed afloat, it must mean the program works?</p><p>It takes several years for an ISAs to pay back the company, yet a company needs that money right away, because teachers don't take rain checks. Lambda School's solution was to sell half their ISAs to hedge funds at a discount, in exchange for cash up front.</p><p>Nobody told the students about these deals. Their marketing claimed, "We don't get paid until you do." Students thought that if the school was solvent, the program had to work, right? In reality, the company was burning through venture capital at a staggering rate, and propped up by hedge funds.</p><p>When these hedge fund deals were exposed, Austen claimed that he never lied about it. He argued it didn't make a difference, anyway, because Lambda School was still incentive-aligned. He argued that if the program didn't work out, hedge funds would stop buying the ISAs.</p><p>That's exactly what happened. In February of 2020, Lambda School's ISAs <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21135134/lambda-school-students-edly-isa-debt-swapping-partnership-shares-investors?ref=sandofsky.com" rel="noreferrer">disappeared from Edly</a>, an ISA marketplace. The hedge funds were done being bag holders.</p><hr><p>When a startup with an inexperienced founder struggles, investors bring in an 'adult' to fix things. Following <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/22/lambda-school-cuts-staff-and-exec-pay-amid-market-uncertainty/?ref=sandofsky.com" rel="noreferrer">their first round of layoffs</a>, Molly Graham was hired as Chief Operating Officer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/expanding-access-opportunity-why-im-joining-lambda-school-graham/?ref=sandofsky.com" rel="noreferrer">in May of 2020</a>.

Instead of fixing the training, he tried to disrupt his way out of the problem, leading to the launch of the company's dumbest product: unpaid internships.</p><figure><img src="https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/2024/04/image-4.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1836" srcset="https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/image-4.png 600w, https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/04/image-4.png 1000w, https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/04/image-4.png 1600w, https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/2024/04/image-4.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>Companies could "try" an engineer at their company for four weeks at no cost.

Then you cast as wide a net as possible, signing up as many people as possible. Run classes at low overhead, and then just scale your way to riches.</p><p>From the beginning, Lambda School was designed to run cheap. With classes run entirely online, students attend from across the country, with hundreds crammed into a single Zoom session.</p><p>From the beginning, Lambda School's ISAs had bizarre fine print, like the five-year term that applies from whenever you graduate or (just as likely) drop out. After the program, you could find zero work, go back to school for an associate's degree, and still owe the school money. Income Share Agreements only protect students if they're willing to give up their dream of becoming a developer.</p><p>Then there was the refund policy. While the program lasted 40 weeks, students were on the hook for 40% of their ISA after week four, and 100% of their ISA debt after week ten.

The best thing that happened to Lambda School was COVID.</p><p>As the world shut down with the pandemic, technology was the one industry that thrived, and big tech companies were desperate for employees. Lambda School intersected the two areas with the most potential: online-only classes, and training for tech jobs. Despite all the controversies, they announced another round of funding in August, 2020.</p><p>They had one chance to change the trajectory of the company. Following Molly Graham's all-hands meeting that revealed their dire financial situation, she laid out the plan to set things right.</p><hr><p>In Fall of 2020, Lambda School decimated its program to save money. Not only did they cut the program from nine months to six months, they also removed all paid TA positions, replacing them with "Peer mentoring." Students in later units were expected to mentor students in earlier units.</p><figure><img src="https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/2024/04/image-7.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1460" height="970" srcset="https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/image-7.png 600w, https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/04/image-7.png 1000w, https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/2024/04/image-7.png 1460w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption><span>The explanation they fed to students.</span></figcaption></figure><p>This was catastrophic, because Lambda School's huge class sizes left little time for instructors to spend one-on-one time with students. TAs were essential for students to keep up, and they were now replaced by students upset by unpaid work. This led to people coasting through the program without anyone so much as glancing at their homework.</p><p>This all happened mid-program, screwing over students already on the hook for tens of thousands of dollars of debt. Soon, students formed their own Discord to consider legal options, and the official Lambda School subreddit was flooded with <a href="https://archive.ph/4Qhzh?ref=sandofsky.com" rel="noreferrer">angry students</a> revolting against the changes.</p><p>Slashing the program couldn't stop the bleeding, and April 2021 saw <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/lambda-school-lays-off-65-employees-amid-restructuring/?ref=sandofsky.com" rel="noreferrer">a major layoff</a> that cut 65 of their <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26810036&amp;ref=sandofsky.com" rel="noreferrer">200 employees</a>. While this bought the company more time, it needed to completely rethink its business, but most of Lambda School's executives weren't up for that ride. Austen's cofounders, Ben Nelson and Caleb Hicks, quietly resigned in April and June of 2021, and Molly Graham <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/lambda-school-coo-steps-down-amid-controversy-bootcamp-layoffs-2021-10?ref=sandofsky.com" rel="noreferrer">resigned</a> that October.</p><p>In November 2021, Lambda School rebooted. Income Share agreements were still available, but with ridiculous terms. Instead of $0 up front, students now paid up to $7,950. The maximum repayment cap was raised to $42,950. Most importantly, they removed the promise that you only paid back your ISA for a tech job; now you were on the hook for <em>any</em> job over $50,000 a year.</p><p>The new Lambda School put heavy emphasis on traditional loans that charge up to 18.95% interest on $19,000 in tuition. They included a "Tuition Refund Guarantee." They claimed that if you don't get a job within one year, you get a 110% refund, but the fine print is ridiculous. Students must apply to ten jobs per week, reach out to ten strangers per week, <em>and</em> post ten code changes online per week, for 40 weeks in the next year. It's the student's responsibility to track all of this.</p><hr><p>Alongside the pivot away from ISAs, the company changed its name to "The Bloom Institute of Technology." Everyone on the Internet rightfully assumed it was to escape the negative publicity, like when Philip Morris renamed itself Altria. If you Googled "Lambda School" at the time, the first page turned up their crimes and painted the picture of a school on the cusp of collapse.</p><p>Austen claims the rebranding was all about a trademark dispute… and technically that is true. Back in 2019, the AI hardware company Lambda Labs sued Lambda School for the Lambda in its name. But what were the grounds for its case? </p><p><a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.344815/gov.uscourts.cand.344815.74.0.pdf?ref=sandofsky.com" rel="noreferrer">According to the lawsuit</a>, Lambda School's deceptions damaged its brand.</p><figure><img src="https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/2024/05/image.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1984" height="742" srcset="https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/image.png 600w, https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/image.png 1000w, https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/05/image.png 1600w, https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/2024/05/image.png 1984w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption><span>Case 4:19-cv-04060-JST Document 74 Filed 06/16/20 Page 3 of 7</span></figcaption></figure><p>As the case dragged on, Lambda School went so far as to acquire the "Red Lambda" trademark from a company in Florida to defend its ownership.</p><p>After fighting this case for years, why did they suddenly give up? It's true, lawsuits are expensive and the company was burning through too much money, but that doesn't explain the <em>scale</em> of their rebranding.</p><p>Normally when companies settle these disputes, the loser negotiates to change things <em>as little as possible</em> to make the winner happy. For example, when the World Wildlife Fund went after the World Wrestling Federation for "WWF," and the latter agreed to change their name to "World Wrestling Entertainment" and made minor tweaks to its logo.</p><figure><img src="https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/2024/04/wwf.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="600" srcset="https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/wwf.jpg 600w, https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/04/wwf.jpg 1000w, https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/2024/04/wwf.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>If you wanted to save Lambda School's brand, you might do something as simple as turning the Lambda into a Delta. Delta signifies change, and the school is supposed to change students, so I'd argue Delta is actually <em>better</em> than Lambda from a messaging perspective.</p><figure><img src="https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/2024/04/image-32.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="934" height="394" srcset="https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/image-32.png 600w, https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/2024/04/image-32.png 934w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>The old Lambda School logo vs one I'd propose.</span></figcaption></figure><p>That's just one possibility. Obviously there's more that goes into this, like searching the trademark registry, but the goal is to stay as close to the original as possible. They didn't do that because their brand was now worthless, and the trademark lawsuit was a perfect excuse to throw it all out. However, try as they may to run away from their past, there's no outrunning justice.</p><p>The journalist who exposed Lambda School wasn't a journalist by trade. Vincent Woo was a successful entrepreneur best known for CoderPad, a collaborative coding website used extensively in programming job interviews. After he sold CoderPad for millions of dollars, he focused on the public interest, such as <a href="https://yimbyaction.org/2021/people/vincent-woo/?ref=sandofsky.com" rel="noreferrer">housing activism</a>.</p><p>Woo's work on CoderPad gave him expert insight into the programming job market, and in 2019, Austen's outrageous hiring numbers set off red flags. Whenever pressed for more details on his outrageous claims, Austen said a full report was coming soon, but six months would pass without any updates.</p><figure><img src="https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/2024/06/image-4.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="602" height="814" srcset="https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/06/image-4.png 600w, https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/2024/06/image-4.png 602w"></figure><p>Woo's obtained an investment memo Lambda School sent out to Y Combinator titled, "Human Capital: The Last Unoptimized Asset Class." In it, they disclose, “We’re at roughly 50% placement for cohorts that are 6 months graduated,” contradicting the very front page of their website.</p><figure><img src="https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/2024/04/Screen-Shot-2021-05-19-at-9.01.43-PM.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1159" srcset="https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/Screen-Shot-2021-05-19-at-9.01.43-PM.png 600w, https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/04/Screen-Shot-2021-05-19-at-9.01.43-PM.png 1000w, https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/04/Screen-Shot-2021-05-19-at-9.01.43-PM.png 1600w, https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/2024/04/Screen-Shot-2021-05-19-at-9.01.43-PM.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Where did the 86% on their homepage come from? In 2018, Lambda School submitted a single report about 72 graduates to <a href="https://www.cirr.org/?ref=sandofsky.com" rel="noreferrer">CIRR</a>. CIRR is an organization formed by the boot camp industry following <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-03-01-new-reporting-agency-aims-to-track-coding-school-outcomes-and-standards?ref=sandofsky.com" rel="noreferrer">the boot camp crackdown of the 2010s</a>, to cleanup their image. Bootcamps are supposed to submit their hiring stats every six months, in one standard format, to prevent underhanded boot camps from fudging the numbers. In two years, Lambda School had produced nothing beyond that single, small report.</p><p>Woo reached out to Sabrina Baez, Lambda School's former Director of Career Readiness. Baez oversaw job placement in those early days, and Austen had reprimanded her for low hiring rates. She told Woo that probably only 50% to 60% of graduates found jobs.</p><p>Finally, Woo obtained private communications with investors revealing the quiet deals with hedge funds. This flew in the face of their marketing's, "We don’t get paid until you do," and Austen's now-deleted tweet, “We never, ever get paid upfront for ISAs.”</p><p>With all the damning evidence, the story was ready. Most reporters would now email their subjects for comment, but Woo elevated the story to performance art. He asked Austen for a recorded interview, without revealing its nature. Austen, lulled into a false sense of security by tech press puff pieces, agreed. What followed was the most riveting hour of tech journalism I've ever heard.</p><figure></figure><p>Austen: <em>"Our goal right now, is that if a student is endorsed, call it graduation, that we place 80% within 120 days."</em></p><p>Woo: <em>"Why did you tell investors 50?"</em></p><p>Austen: <em>"What… I don't know… what communication you're referring to."</em></p><p>The interview went downhill from there, as Austen scrambled to invent excuses.</p><p>NYMag <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/02/lambda-schools-job-placement-rate-is-lower-than-claimed.html?ref=sandofsky.com" rel="noreferrer">published Woo's story</a> on February 19, 2020, and that very same day Lambda School pushed out <a href="https://www.bloomtech.com/article/announcing-our-new-isa-financing-blueprint-and-100m-in-new-financing?ref=sandofsky.com" rel="noreferrer">a blog post</a> announcing they resold ISAs.</p><p>One month later, Austen published a report purporting 71% job placement rates— but he arrived there by removing the "$50,000 or more" bit. He claimed that the 50% he had told investors was actually total enrolled students, not graduates. Yet if you <a href="https://www.applieddivinitystudies.com/lambda-lies/?ref=sandofsky.com" rel="noreferrer">dissect Austen's own data</a>, you quickly arrive at 55%.</p><p>Moving forward, Lambda School's job reports only counted graduates who were "job seeking." This is a common trick where bootcamps make up reasons that they don't have to count the graduates who couldn't find jobs. If a graduate, say, stops working with a useless career coach who mostly blames them for not trying hard enough, then the bootcamp classifies that graduate as no longer job seeking. In Lambda School's last outcomes report, they gloss over the 34% of graduates who were not job-seeking, as if it's perfectly normal for someone to go through an intense nine-month program and just change their mind. </p><p>On October 25, 2021, Vincent Woo delivered a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/lambda-school-promised-lucrative-tech-coding-career-low-job-placement-2021-10?ref=sandofsky.com" rel="noreferrer">follow-up story</a>, published by Business Insider. Not only did it leak the company's infamous 2020 all-hands meeting that exposed the company's downward spiral, it also revealed that only 27% of graduates found jobs.</p><p>It wasn't because of COVID. Tech only saw a minor dip at the start of the pandemic. In fact, tech companies were so thirsty for talent that it was easier than ever to get a job as a developer without a college degree.</p><p>The reason Lambda School's hiring rates dropped should be obvious to anyone who spends time around bootcamps, or education in general. Lambda School tried to scale up. Small schools and small class sizes have better results, largely because it's hard to find good instructors, and people need a lot of 1:1 attention. Bootcamps don't scale up to become business dollar businesses.</p><p>Staff warned about a downward trajectory back in 2018, in an internal memo that said, “Placement to date has been manual and one-off, which isn’t possible to scale.” That was back when they were training a few hundred students a year, and at their peak, they trained 2,700 students.</p><p>In response to Woo's latest story, Austen claimed that the numbers were wrong, but couldn't explain why he'd present wrong numbers to his entire company. Despite his denials, the layoffs and executive exodus made it clear to outsiders that Lambda School had crashed and burned.</p><p>Two days later, Austen tweeted:</p><blockquote>I wish people could see how ugly it is to be envious, and how obvious it is to those around you when that's what's happening.<p>There's not much uglier than trying to tear someone down because they achieved what you wish you had.</p></blockquote><p>Is he talking about Vincent Woo? Woo's CoderPad made a lasting impact on tech hiring, and he successfully sold that company for more money than Austen could ever make from Lambda School. What could Woo possibly be jealous of?</p><p>Some blame for this distortion falls on Paul Graham. Back in December 2019, at the top of Austen's downward spiral, Graham gave him a pep-talk.</p><figure><img src="https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/2024/05/image-7.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="665" height="643" srcset="https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/image-7.png 600w, https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/2024/05/image-7.png 665w"><figcaption><span>The Lambda School student Slack, December 2019.</span></figcaption></figure><p>Graham later turned it into <a href="https://paulgraham.com/fh.html?ref=sandofsky.com" rel="noreferrer">an essay about "Haters</a>." He wrote:</p><blockquote>What sort of people become haters? Can anyone become one? I'm not sure about this, but I've noticed some patterns. Haters are generally losers in a very specific sense: although they are occasionally talented, they have never achieved much. And indeed, anyone successful enough to have achieved significant fame would be unlikely to regard another famous person as a fraud on that account, because anyone famous knows how random fame is.</blockquote><p>Graham even thanked Austen for reviewing it, along with Elon Musk and Peter Thiel.</p><blockquote><strong>Thanks</strong>&nbsp;to Austen Allred, Trevor Blackwell, Patrick Collison, Christine Ford, Daniel Gackle, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, Elon Musk, Harj Taggar, and Peter Thiel for reading drafts of this.</blockquote><p>Graham published that essay on January 11, 2020, and Woo recorded his fateful interview with Austen eleven days later. That humiliation still haunted Austen two years later, as he struggled to paint a picture of a thriving company.</p><figure><img src="https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/2024/04/IMG_E6D11B8CE055-1.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1290" height="1166" srcset="https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/IMG_E6D11B8CE055-1.jpeg 600w, https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/04/IMG_E6D11B8CE055-1.jpeg 1000w, https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/2024/04/IMG_E6D11B8CE055-1.jpeg 1290w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Following Woo's reporting, Lambda School was pressured to publish regular, audited job reports.

It's because every time he's caught in a lie, he recites the <a href="https://www.thelifedoctor.org/the-narcissist-s-prayer?ref=sandofsky.com" rel="noreferrer">Narcissist's Prayer</a>:</p><p><em>    That didn't happen.</em></p><p><em>    And if it did, it wasn't that bad.</em></p><p><em>    And if it was, that's not a big deal.</em></p><p><em>    And if it is, that's not my fault.</em></p><p><em>    And if it was, I didn't mean it.</em></p><p><em>    And if I did, you deserved it.</em></p><p>Consider the time Austen tweeted that 100% of the students in his UX class had been hired, when only one student graduated. I <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26813371&amp;ref=sandofsky.com" rel="noreferrer">confronted him about it on Hacker News</a>, pointing to screenshots in The Verge article. He replied:</p><blockquote>I did say the hiring rate of a cohort of one student was 100%. And in the same tweet I said, in all caps BUT VERY SMALL SAMPLE SIZE. Odd how that doesn’t make the article, don’t you think?</blockquote><p>For the record, the article included "VERY SMALL SAMPLE SIZE," twice, and I think that makes him look <em>worse</em>. Either he genuinely thinks a vague disclaimer is a get-out-of-jail-free card, or he's using the classic narcissist bluff of projecting so much confidence that the accuser wonders if <em>they're</em> the idiot for bringing this up.</p><p>In another incident on Hacker News, I mentioned Lambda School's unpaid intern program, Lambda Fellows. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33826581&amp;ref=sandofsky.com" rel="noreferrer">Austen replied</a>:</p><blockquote>Again, not true. We launched a program called "fellows" where&nbsp;<em>companies didn't pay</em>, but&nbsp;<em>we paid the students</em>, and if the company afterwards hired the student they would pay us back. It was successful and operates to this day.</blockquote><p>This is a lie. When Fellows launched, the program was unpaid. Following the backlash, he agreed to pay students. When I pointed to his own company's FAQ saying the program was unpaid, he replied:</p><blockquote>This is fair - there were students who just wanted experience even if unpaid, and the initial intent was to build it into the school itself literally with no pay. I changed my mind on that one after conversations with a few students, and we changed the design as you pointed out, but no student ever did any unpaid work, so it's also not accurate to say that we had a bunch of students doing unpaid work.</blockquote><p>He flipped from "<em>that didn't happen</em>," to "<em>And if it did, it wasn't that bad," </em>without missing a beat. The "no student ever did any unpaid work" bit is a lie, because they piloted the program for <em>months</em> before its debut, without paying students.</p><figure><div><p><img src="https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/2024/04/Screen-Shot-2020-11-19-at-3.54.39-PM.png" width="1136" height="558" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/Screen-Shot-2020-11-19-at-3.54.39-PM.png 600w, https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/04/Screen-Shot-2020-11-19-at-3.54.39-PM.png 1000w, https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/2024/04/Screen-Shot-2020-11-19-at-3.54.39-PM.png 1136w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/2024/04/Screen-Shot-2020-11-19-at-4.11.51-PM.png" width="1124" height="556" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/Screen-Shot-2020-11-19-at-4.11.51-PM.png 600w, https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/04/Screen-Shot-2020-11-19-at-4.11.51-PM.png 1000w, https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/2024/04/Screen-Shot-2020-11-19-at-4.11.51-PM.png 1124w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p></div><figcaption><p><span>Austen bragging about the Fellows program, before its public launch and backlash.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>Austen still claims he spent time homeless, but he wasn't actually homeless. At least not in the way most people think. When you hear "homeless," you probably imagine someone thrust into the spot due to mental illness, addiction, or domestic violence. Austen chose to camp out of his car to avoid paying rent while he pitched his first startup around Silicon Valley. Back in Utah, his annoyed fiancé and multi-millionaire parents waited with open arms. To Austen, homelessness was a fun personal challenge, like running a marathon or cutting out red meat.</p><figure><img src="https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/2024/04/image-16.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1242" height="520" srcset="https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/image-16.png 600w, https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/04/image-16.png 1000w, https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/2024/04/image-16.png 1242w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>He <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-crazy-is-it-to-voluntarily-be-homeless-to-pursue-the-lean-startup-ideal/answer/Austen-Allred?ref=sandofsky.com" rel="noreferrer">wrote on Quora</a>:</p><figure><img src="https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/2024/04/image-17.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1232" height="190" srcset="https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/image-17.png 600w, https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/04/image-17.png 1000w, https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/2024/04/image-17.png 1232w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>Austen distorted his past to recruit students who were genuinely homeless. Jesse Horne <a href="https://medium.com/@jessehorne/my-story-as-a-homeless-developer-5874731c42ed?ref=sandofsky.com" rel="noreferrer">first experienced homelessness</a> at 17 years old, due to family issues and mental health problems. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17936860&amp;ref=sandofsky.com" rel="noreferrer">Austen replied</a> on Hacker News, "Hi Jesse, I'm also formerly homeless…" before pitching him on Lambda School's latest innovation: <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/lambda-perpetual-access-fund?ref=sandofsky.com" rel="noreferrer">a GoFundMe</a> to send the homeless to Lambda School.</p><p>If Austen truly believes he was homeless, that might even be worse than just lying for publicity. If he lacks empathy for those genuinely struggling, it explains why he jumped to victim blaming when students brought up problems. To him, the system is never broken, you just aren't working hard enough. His "tuition refund guarantee" isn't misleading, because if you aren't ready to submit 400 job applications just don't have what it takes to pull yourself up by your bootstraps.</p><p>I think Austen could have found success starting an MLM back in Utah, a state <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/theslice/mormon-utah-valley-multilevel-marketing-thrive-doterra?ref=sandofsky.com" rel="noreferrer">run rampant</a> with get-rich-quick schemes. His mistake was going after education in California, a state ready to deal with for-profit schools. He wasn't ready for the law.</p><hr><p>In 2019, California's BPPE fined Lambda School $75,000 and ordered them to cease operations. Like any for-profit school, Lambda needed to register with the state and wait for approval. They had never even registered and just operated illegally for the last two years.</p><p>Austen claimed the school had made an honest mistake, and the company lawyer, who he claimed told them that since all the classes were online, it didn't need approval. Sure. Austen claimed the paperwork was filed, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21131848/lambda-school-coding-bootcamp-isa-tuition-cost-free?ref=sandofsky.com" rel="noreferrer">told students</a>, “The process takes time, but we’re working with [BPPE] to comply. There is no impact to students right now.”</p><p>Eight months later, on a hunch, I emailed the BPPE. They <a href="https://twitter.com/sandofsky/status/1211717254712135680?ref=sandofsky.com" rel="noreferrer">told me</a> that Lambda School was not approved, had been ordered to shut down, and they were operating illegally. Austen sidestepped this issue with students because he didn't want students to know about an important <a href="https://law.justia.com/codes/california/2022/code-edc/title-3/division-10/part-59/chapter-8/article-12/section-94917/?ref=sandofsky.com" rel="noreferrer">California law</a>: when a school operates illegally, the students don't owe it any money. All of those income share agreements were invalid. Despite this, Lambda School still went after graduates who shouldn't have had to pay.</p><p>The company struggled with California approval because ISAs existed in a legal gray area. In fact Lambda School <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/federal-lobbying/clients/summary?cycle=2019&amp;id=D000103916&amp;ref=sandofsky.com" rel="noreferrer">spent $210,000 on Washington lobbyists</a> in 2019 to try to straighten them out, to no avail. In 2020, Lambda School gave up offering ISAs in California, they were quickly approved. But even bigger legal trouble was brewing.</p><p>Believe it or not, until January 1, 2021, there were no laws in California to protect consumers from a lie in Lambda School's contracts; the company claimed students they were taking on student loans that couldn't be discharged in bankruptcy, which was completely false. In January of 2021, <a href="https://legiscan.com/CA/text/AB1864/2019?ref=sandofsky.com" rel="noreferrer">AB 1864</a> went into effect, and California's financial protection bureau <a href="https://dfpi.ca.gov/2021/04/26/lambda-school-reaches-settlement-with-dfpi-agreeing-to-end-deceptive-educational-financing-practices/?ref=sandofsky.com" rel="noreferrer">laid down the law.</a></p><figure><img src="https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/2024/04/image-19.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1816" height="278" srcset="https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/image-19.png 600w, https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/04/image-19.png 1000w, https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/04/image-19.png 1600w, https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/2024/04/image-19.png 1816w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>Lambda School tried to underplay the settlement. They claimed that regulators had approved of the school, and merely asked them to remove a bit from the contract that was "not required." When California got wind of the spin, they issued a follow-up announcement calling out their bullshit.</p><blockquote>The DFPI has received information that Lambda used potentially misleading marketing after executing its settlement with DFPI to resolve deceptive practices. &nbsp;<p>Lambda School recently published a public blog post that the DFPI believes could be misinterpreted by potential students or the public more generally.<br>…</p></blockquote><p>Meanwhile, the uprising that destroyed Lambda School's subreddit boiled over into the real world, as students spread the word of <a href="https://defendstudents.org/?ref=sandofsky.com" rel="noreferrer">The National Student Legal Defense</a>, a legal non-profit that helps students trapped by predatory schools. Because students signed away their rights to a class action lawsuit as part of their enrollment agreement, the non-profit had to tackle arbitration on a case-by-case basis. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/lambda-school-lawsuits/?ref=sandofsky.com" rel="noreferrer">first three lawsuits</a> landed in May 2021.</p><figure><img src="https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/2024/04/image-20.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1110" height="682" srcset="https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/image-20.png 600w, https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/04/image-20.png 1000w, https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/2024/04/image-20.png 1110w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Lambda School quietly settled all eight cases so far, but this is a slow process. Student Defense thought they found a weakness in the anti-class-action provisions, after changes Lambda School made to their contracts in 2020. They <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/lambda-school-bloomtech-class-action-lawsuit-2023-3?ref=sandofsky.com" rel="noreferrer">filed a class action lawsuit</a> in 2023, this time naming Austen Allred himself a defendant, in addition to the company.</p><figure><img src="https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/2024/04/image-21.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1120" height="1352" srcset="https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/image-21.png 600w, https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/04/image-21.png 1000w, https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/2024/04/image-21.png 1120w"></figure><p>Sadly, in January 2024, a judge ruled that the case had to go through arbitration. Austen, as usual, misrepresented what happened, claiming it as a win.</p><figure><img src="https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/2024/04/image-22.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1290" height="1477" srcset="https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/image-22.png 600w, https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/04/image-22.png 1000w, https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/2024/04/image-22.png 1290w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>It felt like Austen would get away with everything. I couldn't believe that was the end of this story. What lesson have I learned watching this story unfold over the past five years? That you can get away with anything if you pick the right victims?</p><p>Two months later, the law finally caught up. In April 2024, the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-takes-action-against-coding-boot-camp-bloomtech-and-ceo-austen-allred-for-deceiving-students-and-hiding-loan-costs/?ref=sandofsky.com" rel="noreferrer">announced a settlement</a> with both the company, and Austen individually. Both had tricked students with inflated job-placement rates, lied about selling loans to investors, and violated <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/rules/holder-due-course-rule?ref=sandofsky.com" rel="noreferrer">the Holder Rule</a>. The CFPB decided that ISAs are just loans with hidden fees.</p><p>They banned Austen and Lambda School from engaging in student lending. Every student who has not found a job in the last year was released from their ISA. They fined the school itself a mere $64,000, and personally fined Austen $100,000.</p><p>Beyond the penalties, the ruling validated everyone that Austen gaslit over the years. The <a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_bloomtech-inc-consent-order_2024-04.pdf?ref=sandofsky.com" rel="noreferrer">consent order</a> spelled out every one of his lies.</p><figure><img src="https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/2024/06/image-2.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="381" srcset="https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/06/image-2.png 600w, https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/06/image-2.png 1000w, https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/06/image-2.png 1600w, https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/2024/06/image-2.png 2110w"></figure><p>But with all the money revolving around the company, isn't $100,000 just a slap on the wrist? While Austen likes to play the role of a successful entrepreneur, he claims he isn't rich.</p><figure><img src="https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/2024/04/image-26.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1290" height="1803" srcset="https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/image-26.png 600w, https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/04/image-26.png 1000w, https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/2024/04/image-26.png 1290w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Obviously he didn't have money going in, as his previous startups went nowhere, but what is this "secondary offering" thing?</p><p>Normally, a founder only gets rich when their company has an IPO or gets bought.  When a startup grows as fast as Lambda School, sometimes investors allow the founders to sell a portion (say, 20%?) of their stock to outsiders, early. This is known as a secondary offering. Why? If the founder is allowed to take enough money off the table that to become slightly rich, they feel less pressure to sell the company before it reaches its full potential.</p><p>However, if the founder truly believes in the future of their company, they'll use that cash to pay off taxes on the rest of their stock. Without getting too far in the weeds, that's like winning a hand at poker and going all-in on the next round. If that's really what happened, then Austen threw away millions of dollars.</p><p>Lambda School is now seven years old, an age when successful startups look to IPO. Surely his investors have given up and marked it as a loss on their balance sheets. At this point, any reasonable founder would wind down the company, brush themselves off, and start on their next venture.</p><p>Now up to its third layoff in three years, it seems Austen will do whatever it takes to keep the lights on. He would rather captain a ghost ship than admit defeat and move on. Why?</p><hr><p>According to his book, Austen follows one thousand strangers on Twitter every day. Over a decade, this has amassed him 330,000 followers. But what has that ultimately achieved?</p><p>Follower counts are deceiving. Because of Twitter's longstanding "churn" problem, most followers of old accounts are inactive. When you gain followers by just following strangers, those followers are very low-value. They either followed back out of courtesy, or because they're bots planning to message you spam.</p><p>For example, Austen launched a YouTube channel last year. He repeatedly plugged it on Twitter, and even offered money to followers.</p><figure><img src="https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/2024/05/image-12.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1108" height="418" srcset="https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/image-12.png 600w, https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/image-12.png 1000w, https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/2024/05/image-12.png 1108w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>One year later, the channel sits at 866 subscribers. The videos themselves have a mere few hundreds views. Yes, Austen has a big follower count on Twitter, but that doesn't amount to much.</p><p>This speaks to the self-destructive cocktail that causes all his problems: an unhealthy relationship with social media, a pervasive grind mindset, and the need to distort reality.</p><p>Other unscrupulous bootcamps never face the scrutiny or Lambda School, and I'm certain other startup CEOs that commit crimes but never face personal charges. Austen wouldn't have faced consequences if he hadn't tweeted the smoking guns that took him down. He seems to care more about attention than success, like he'd rather be hated than forgotten.</p><p>Just as Lambda School sold the dream that anyone can get a job as a developer with a few months of grind, Austen was sold the dream if he just works enough hours, someday he'll become Elon Musk. But the world doesn't work like a Silicon Valley startup, and while the wheels of justice turn slowly, they grind exceedingly fine. Just as his victims couldn't afford a day in court, Austen finds himself in a similar situation, oblivious to the irony.</p><figure><img src="https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/2024/04/image-31.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1290" height="984" srcset="https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/image-31.png 600w, https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/04/image-31.png 1000w, https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/2024/04/image-31.png 1290w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Austen has moved back to a small town in Utah. He's begun promoting his new side-hustle, a small venture capital fund, but he assures everyone that Lambda School is alive and well. They've pivoted into AI classes.</p><p>A few days before the consumer financial protection bureau fined him $100,000, he tweeted:</p><figure><img src="https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/2024/06/image-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1290" height="903" srcset="https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/06/image-1.png 600w, https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/06/image-1.png 1000w, https://www.sandofsky.com/content/images/2024/06/image-1.png 1290w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Maybe this is like his "100% hired" distortion. After all, five times zero is still zero. Or maybe he really believes it. Maybe the last person he's fooled is himself.</p>

            <p>Arvind Mithal, the Charles W. and Jennifer C. Johnson Professor in Computer Science and Engineering at MIT, head of the faculty of computer science in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS), and a&nbsp;pillar of the MIT community, died on June 17. Arvind, who went by the mononym, was 77 years old.</p><p>A prolific researcher who led the Computation Structures Group in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), Arvind served on the MIT faculty for nearly five decades.</p><p>“He was beloved by countless people across the MIT community and around the world who were inspired by his intellectual brilliance and zest for life,” President Sally Kornbluth wrote in a letter to the MIT community today.</p><p>As a scientist, Arvind was well known for important contributions to dataflow computing, which seeks to optimize the flow of data to take advantage of parallelism, achieving faster and more efficient computation.</p><p>In the last 25 years, his research interests&nbsp;broadened to include developing techniques and tools for formal modeling, high-level synthesis, and formal verification of complex digital devices like microprocessors and hardware accelerators, as well as memory models and cache coherence protocols for parallel computing architectures and programming languages.</p><p>Those who knew Arvind describe him as a rare individual whose interests and expertise ranged from high-level, theoretical formal systems all the way down through languages and compilers to the gates and structures of silicon hardware.</p><p>The applications of Arvind’s work are far-reaching, from&nbsp;<a href="https://news.mit.edu/2019/solid-state-drives-flash-storage-data-center-efficiency-0403" target="_blank">reducing the amount of energy and space required by data centers</a> to&nbsp;<a href="https://news.mit.edu/2012/hardware-testing-multicore-0413" target="_blank">streamlining the design of more efficient multicore computer chips</a>.</p><p>“Arvind was both a tremendous scholar in the fields of computer architecture and programming languages and a dedicated teacher, who brought systems-level thinking to our students. He was also an exceptional academic leader, often leading changes in curriculum and contributing to the Engineering Council in meaningful and impactful ways. I will greatly miss his sage advice and wisdom,” says Anantha Chandrakasan, chief innovation and strategy officer, dean of engineering, and the Vannevar Bush Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.</p><p>“Arvind’s positive energy, together with his hearty laugh, brightened so many people’s lives. He was an enduring source of wise counsel for colleagues and for generations of students. With his deep commitment to academic excellence, he not only transformed research in computer architecture and parallel computing but also brought that commitment to his role as head of the computer science faculty in the EECS department. He left a lasting impact on all of us who had the privilege of working with him,” says Dan Huttenlocher, dean of the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing&nbsp;and the Henry Ellis Warren Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.</p><p>Arvind developed an interest in parallel computing while he was a student at the Indian Institute of Technology in Kanpur, from which he received his bachelor’s degree in 1969. He earned a master’s degree and PhD in computer science in 1972 and 1973, respectively, from the University of Minnesota, where he studied operating systems and mathematical models of program behavior. He taught at the University of California at Irvine from 1974 to 1978 before joining the faculty at MIT.</p><p>At MIT, Arvind’s group studied parallel computing and declarative programming languages, and he led the development of two parallel computing languages, Id<em>&nbsp;</em>and pH. He continued his work on these programming languages through the 1990s, publishing the book “Implicit Parallel Programming in pH”<em>&nbsp;</em>with co-author R.S. Nikhil in 2001, the culmination of more than 20 years of research.</p><p>In addition to his research, Arvind was an important academic leader in EECS. He served as head of computer science faculty in the department and played a critical role in helping with the reorganization of EECS after the establishment of the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing.</p><p>“Arvind was a force of nature, larger than life in every sense. His relentless positivity, unwavering optimism, boundless generosity, and exceptional strength as a researcher was truly inspiring and left a profound mark on all who had the privilege of knowing him. I feel enormous gratitude for the light he brought into our lives and his fundamental impact on our community,” says Daniela Rus, the Andrew and Erna Viterbi Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and the director of CSAIL.</p><p>His work on dataflow and parallel computing led to the Monsoon project in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Arvind’s group, in collaboration with Motorola, built 16 dataflow computing machines and developed their associated software. One Monsoon dataflow machine is now in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.computerhistory.org/collections/catalog/102733836" target="_blank">Computer History Museum</a> in Mountain View, California.</p><p>Arvind’s focus shifted in the 1990s when, as he explained in a 2012 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xaqafe4e2k" target="_blank">interview</a> for the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), funding for research into parallel computing began to dry up.</p><p>“Microprocessors were getting so much faster that people thought they didn’t need it,” he recalled.</p><p>Instead, he began applying techniques his team had learned and developed for parallel programming to the principled design of digital hardware.</p><p>In addition to mentoring students and junior colleagues at MIT, Arvind also advised universities and governments in many countries on research in parallel programming and semiconductor design.</p><p>Based on his work on digital hardware design, Arvind founded Sandburst in 2000, a fabless manufacturing company for semiconductor chips. He served as the company’s president for two years before returning to the MIT faculty, while continuing as an advisor.&nbsp;Sandburst was later acquired by Broadcom.</p><p>Arvind and his students also developed Bluespec, a programming language designed to automate the design of chips. Building off this work, he co-founded the startup Bluespec, Inc., in 2003, to develop practical tools that help engineers streamline device design.</p><p>Over the past decade, he was dedicated to advancing undergraduate education at MIT by bringing modern design tools to courses 6.004 (Computation Structures) and 6.191 (Introduction to Deep Learning), and incorporating Minispec, a programming language that is closely related to Bluespec.</p><p>Arvind was honored for these and other contributions to data flow and multithread computing, and the development of tools for the high-level synthesis of hardware, with membership in the National Academy of Engineering in 2008 and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2012.&nbsp;He was also named a distinguished alumnus of IIT Kanpur, his undergraduate alma mater.</p><p>“Arvind was more than a pillar of the EECS community and a titan of computer science; he was a beloved colleague and a treasured friend. Those of us with the remarkable good fortune to work and collaborate with Arvind are devastated by his sudden loss. His kindness and joviality were unwavering; his mentorship was thoughtful and well-considered; his guidance was priceless. We will miss Arvind deeply,” says Asu Ozdaglar, deputy dean of the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing and head of EECS.</p><p>Among numerous other awards, including membership in the Indian National Academy of Sciences and fellowship in the Association for Computing Machinery and IEEE, he received the Harry H. Goode Memorial Award from IEEE in 2012, which honors significant contributions to theory or practice in the information processing field.</p><p>A humble scientist, Arvind was the first to point out that these achievements were only possible because of his outstanding and brilliant collaborators. Chief among those collaborators were the undergraduate and graduate students he felt fortunate to work with at MIT.&nbsp;He maintained excellent relationships with them both professionally and personally, and valued these relationships more than the work they did together, according to family members.</p><p>In summing up the key to his scientific success, Arvind put it this way in the 2012 IEEE interview: “Really, one has to do what one believes in. I think the level at which most of us work, it is not sustainable if you don’t enjoy it on a day-to-day basis. You can’t work on it just because of the results. You have to work on it because you say, ‘I have to know the answer to this,’” he said.</p><p>He is survived by his wife, Gita Singh Mithal, their two sons&nbsp;Divakar ’01 and Prabhakar ’04, their wives Leena and Nisha, and two grandchildren, Maya and Vikram.&nbsp;</p>

				<p><h2>Agilent 2000a / 3000a Oscilloscope NAND Recovery</h2><h3>[06.04.24]</h3>
                </p>

				<p>
				I ran across an oscilloscope in need of love and attention on the Internet's favorite online auction site. After some back and forth from the seller, I found out that the scope didn't boot, one of the tell tale problems of the Agilent 2000a / 3000a / 4000a X-series oscilloscope series. The no boot condition can be caused by one of three things: a failed power supply, the mischievous NAND corruption error, or both. The seller took my lowball offer of $220 and just like that I had another project in my life.
                </p>

                <p>
				On initial opening, the scope looked like it had road rash. Every single knob and edge of the plastic shell had distinct pavement scuff marks. There were some cracks in the front plastic bezel and rear molded fan grill, further confirming that this scope was dropped multiple times. The horizontal adjust encoder was also bent and two knobs were missing.
				</p> 
				
				<p>
				Not the end of the world, let's double check the description. I plugged it in and the scope powered up with 3 of the 4 indicator lights. Ref, Math, Digital and were illuminated, nothing on serial. The scope stays perpetually in this state with nothing displayed on the LCD. Button presses yield no response. The continuously-on fan and 3 indicator lights are the only source of life. Using a special sequence of power button + unlock cal switch displays no lights on the instrument. The seller clearly did not test the instrument.

				I covered the infamous power supply failure in my colorful youtube repair video of a 350mhz DSOx3034 oscilloscope, embedded below. The problem boils down to a poor implementation of an inexpensive power supply, where the primary side is left on indefinitely when the oscilloscope on/off switch is in the off state. This leads to thermal runaway of components and eventual catastrophic failure many years down the line. That's clearly not the problem with this unit.

			<h2><a href="#disassembly" id="disassembly">Disassembly</a></h2>	
				<p>
				Realizing that this was going to be an involved repair, I decided to take care of the obvious housekeeping first. I did not want the busted encoder serving as a pressed / intermittent input during future software troubleshooting and I actually had a few spare Agilent knobs lying around. Let the disassembly commence.
				</p>
				<a href="https://salvagedcircuitry.com/img/2000a-nand-recovery/P1043405.JPG"><img src="https://salvagedcircuitry.com/img/2000a-nand-recovery/med/P1043405.JPG"></a>
			<p>
				The rear shell of the oscilloscope is removed first. There are (4) T20 torx screws that follow the perimeter of the instrument. Yes, the 4th is hidden inside the spare probe compartment. 
			</p>
				<a href="https://salvagedcircuitry.com/img/2000a-nand-recovery/P2740113e.JPG"><img src="https://salvagedcircuitry.com/img/2000a-nand-recovery/med/P2740113e.JPG"></a>
			<p>
				Following, the plastic front panel is unclipped from the sides, taking extra care not to tear the ~30 pin flat flex cable. There are ~6 clips around the perimeter of the instrument that you have to methodically pry away from the aluminum mid frame of the oscilloscope.
			</p>
				<a href="https://salvagedcircuitry.com/img/2000a-nand-recovery/20240314_205501.JPG"><img src="https://salvagedcircuitry.com/img/2000a-nand-recovery/med/20240314_205501.JPG"></a>			
			<p>
				The front panel PCB is sandwiched between the plastic front panel injection and the front rubber over-molded knobs. It's quite a clever assembly and cost effective assembly. To remove the front panel PCB, first remove all 15 over molded nobs. Pull firmly on base of the knob or use a plastic spudger, the knobs will come off easily. Headed toward the back side of the front panel, depress the 8 molded-in clips and slowly jimmy the board out of place. Don't forget to carefully remove the 10 pin flat flex cable that connects to the menu buttons under the LCD.
				Look ma, no screws!
			</p>
				<a href="https://salvagedcircuitry.com/img/2000a-nand-recovery/20240314_205602.JPG"><img src="https://salvagedcircuitry.com/img/2000a-nand-recovery/med/20240314_205602.JPG"></a>
			<p>
				Finally, the front control PCB is free for analysis. The PCB is relatively straight forward: It's an input board with a bunch of mechanical encoders and plated pads for carbon-backed silicone domed keys. I can safely conclude <i>mechanical</i> encoders because of size, cost and build quality. Optical encoders are hard to miniaturize and will consume a product's BOM in short notice - especially if you need 15 control knobs! 
			</p>
			<h2><a href="#Encoders" id="Encoders">Encoders</a></h2>
			
			<p>
				Hp tried doing this in the early 90s with the 54500 series oscilloscopes. There was one main control knob and buttons to select each mode. That one knob was of course, an optical encoder. HP tried to make this affordable and produced it in house, leading to HP's own line of optical encoders which was later separated from the company and sold under Avago. Avago then sold to Broadcom. The 5000 series must not have sold well or the interface must have annoyed engineers thus more knobs became the status quo.    
			</p> 
			
		    <p>
				You can really seen the carnage on the encoder shaft - nice and straight. The good news is that only one mechanical encoder was damaged, not two and there were zero signs of PCB damage. What a score! With a macro lens, I was able to read a very faint screen printed "24k4J" on the broken encoder. This string yields zero useful information from an online search, but 24 is a useful number.
			</p> 
					
		    <p>					
				Twenty four could be indicating the resolution of the encoder, the number of detents or some kind of internal part series. The damaged encoder is smooth, so 24 is not for detents. The detented encoders on the scope were counted as 24 detents, but the broken device under test is a non-detented encoder. What about resolution? Sure we could assume 24 pulses per 360 degree revolution, but can we do better? Why yes! An easy way to test the number of pulses is to implement a recommended encoder circuit, place an oscilloscope probe on Terminal A and Terminal B and ground each probe. You will need an oscilloscope, passive probes, a 5v power supply, some 10k resistors, 10nf capacitors and a breadboard. I used my lab power supply, but any 5v wall wart would be fine.
			</p>
					
			<p>
				The encoder is an input device, thus it will not output anything over channel a or b until physically turned. Put the oscilloscope in single shot mode and slowly turn the knob. Once the knob is turned, two square waves should be displayed, one on ch1 and the other on ch2 of your oscilloscope. The square waves will be shifted slightly between channel 1 and 2. When the rotational direction of the encoder is changed, the channel with the leading edge square wave will become the lagging square wave. Taking this into account, mark a physical start point (say with sharpie) on the encoder, put the oscilloscope in single shot mode and rotate the encoder. The oscilloscope will capture a waveform whenever the input to either ch1 or ch2 changes. Continue incrementing this procedure to count the number of times the oscilloscope captures a waveform. This number is your pulses / revolution. Looking back, this test would have been easier and more reliable if I removed a non-damaged non-detented encoder from the oscilloscope. The broken one was finicky and yielded inconsistent results (26 pulses the first time). The broken encoder was indeed 24 pulses/rev.      
			</p>
				
			<p>
				A quick digikey search later and I found the mechanical encoders used in the 2000/3000/4000/6000 x-series oscilloscopes. Enter the <a href="https://www.bourns.com/docs/Product-Datasheets/PEC12R.pdf" target="_blank">Bourns PEC12R series</a>. The PEC12R features the same PCB layout, mechanical dimensions and specifications to match the ones used in the oscilloscope. These are 30k rotational cycle life mechanical encoders with 20k button cycle life offered in detented and non-detented versions along with different resolution options. Oddly enough, this information became priceless for my <a href="https://salvagedcircuitry.com/fume-extractor.html" target="_blank">fume extractor project</a>. I overestimated the encoder lifetime needed for a user interface by a long shot. What can I say, a good knob can make or break a product :D.

				<p>
				The encoders arrived quickly but were very vague. I find it a bit underhanded that Bourns took the lazy train. No signs of manufacturer branding, detent number, resolution part number or series. Shame, shame!
				</p>
				
				<p>
				While inside the scope, I decided to deal with the litany of cracks in the front and rear plastic panels. Plastic cracks are an easy fix with fancy epoxy or a simple soldering iron. The main downside to plastic welding is the uneven surface finish left behind. I opted to plastic weld the broken seams from the inside since my good epoxy ran out and no one else will ever see the inside of the scope. NOTE: plastic welding creates bad fumes. Do this outside with a mask or in good ventilation. Melting ABS + PVC plastic blends will yield chlorine gas. ABS + PVC is not common anymore, but still good to know. In a rather surprising discovery, a white eraser and some elbow grease transformed the scope back to it's original OEM state. Who would have guessed!

			<h2><a href="#diggingin" id="diggingin">Digging In</a></h2>
				<p>
				With the cosmetics out of the way, lets dig into the heart of the problem. As stated above, the oscilloscope switches on, powers the fan, illuminates some lights but stops short of displaying anything on the display. Comparing it to videos of other 2000a / 3000a oscilloscopes booting, there's an additional stage of led illumination and button panel self tests that occur before the main LCD displays anything. It's always a good idea to rule out obvious problems, thus thou shall check voltages. Keysight has quite a thorough service guide for troubleshooting and repairing this oscilloscope. <a href="https://salvagedcircuitry.com/docs/2000a-nand-recovery/Service-Guide-2000-3000-X-Series.pdf" target="_blank">Page 78-82</a> detail the numerous test points to probe and the appropriate voltage ranges. Running low on cycles myself, I checked the power supply for 12v and ruled it out. Based on the current operating conditions, the scope seemed to be hanging on boot. This stuck-on-boot issue has been hammered to death on <a href="https://www.eevblog.com/forum/testgear/dsox2000-and-3000-series-licence-have-anyone-tried-to-hack-that-scope/" target="_blank">eevblog.com/forum</a>, with a 130+ page thread dedicated to various repair methods for for the 2000a / 3000a / 4000a scopes. My DSOx-2014a met all the criteria for a scope with boot related issues.

		    <h2><a href="#bootup" id="bootup">Oscilloscope Boot Up Process</a></h2>
				<p>
				An overview of component enumeration is in order. A C13 115v AC cable is plugged into the scope and feeds the Line Filter Board. The board features both the AC line filtering and the main on/off switch for the scope, but the on/off switch is for the secondary side and not the primary side of the PSU. When the on/off switch is pressed, the ps-on signal is tripped and main 12v switch mode PSU outputs through a 20 pin mini-fit jr cable to the main oscilloscope PCB. This large 12v rail is then converted to the various internal system rails. 
			</p>

				The heart of the beast is an ARM microcontroller that runs off the 3.3v rail and handles the memory controller, NAND controller, LCD display menu/interface, windows CE, networking, and interfacing to the FPGA. The FPGA is connected to the arm chip via an EXPI (External Local Bus Interface). FPGAs have many internal power domains and require strict power-up / power-down sequences for the different voltage phases that power the array, oscillators, and I/O peripherals. Voltage rail <a href="https://www.ti.com/lit/an/snva586/snva586.pdf" target="_blank">ramp-up / ramp-down</a> is another important factor for FPGAs and ASICs and certain rails demand low ripple and require an LDO for low noise.

				FPGAs are volatile, and require reprogramming every bootup, usually from a QSPI like memory. FPGAs excel at parallelizing data streams and in this case, handles the less critical external measurements, waveform search &amp; navigation features, and math functions relegated from the MegaZoom IV ASIC. The MegaZoom IV ASIC handles the grunt of the signal processing and handles both the analog and digital inputs from the front end of the oscilloscope. The data from the FPGA is shuttled to external memory and accessed by the main micro for final processing.

				<p>
				Here's a component overview of top component side of the main PCB. Beginning from left to right, there is a power stage section in the upper left hand side of the PCB besides two black heatsinks. Under the left most heatsink sits a Quad 8-bit 1G sample/sec ADC (Analog to Digital Converter) for the 4 analog channels alongside the custom Agilent MegaZoom IV SOC ASIC for waveform, acquisition and digital functions. You can visually see snake-like traces that are length matched differential pairs which truncate at the ADC. A Samsung <a href="https://www.arrow.com/en/products/k4t51163qi-hce6/samsung-electronics" target="_blank">"k4t51163qi-hce6"</a> DDR2 memory chip is found adjacent to the Megazoom IV ASIC. Below the Megazoom IV are the (4) metal-can shielded front end modules for channel 1 --&gt; channel 4. Working toward the center of the PCB, the Xilinx Spartan XC3S500E FPGA and <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/stmicroelectronics/SPEAR600-2/2486643" target="_blank">"ST SPEAR600"</a> 32 bit ARM microcontroller take the spotlight with power stages above and below, likely for the specific low voltage power rails required for the Spartan FPGA. Just below the ST arm chip sits a <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/micron-technology-inc/MT47H64M16HR-3-H/2663733" target="_blank">"micron D9lhr"</a> DDR2 memory chip. Moving further right, a familiar 20 pin Molex Minifit-Jr plug for the main 12v power supply. A 3v 2032 primary lithium solder-in battery sits just above the Mini-fit Jr with an arrangement of a USB ports and trigger BNCs besides. The external module port sits just below this arrangement along with the FPC connectors for the front button panel / keyboard and the LCD.

				<p>
				The opposing side of the board is far less populated. The bottom edge features the waveform gen out BNC, the front 40-pin IDE-style connector for the external MSO module, a USB-A port, some probe compensation clips and the (4) physical BNC channels. You'll notice the remainder of the board is chuck full of SMT caps, with plenty decoupling capacitors adorning the underside of the main ASICs and main CPU. Inductors are spread throughout the back size, indicating there are many specific voltage rails needed for the critical components of this design. The official service manual confirms this with a table of 13 different voltage rails!

				The TSOP48 NAND memory package is what we are most interested in. It is located within close proximity to the back side of the main ST SPEAR600-2 microcontroller. This TSOP48 memory package is a 1gbit or ~125mb <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/micron-technology-inc/NAND01GW3B2CN6E/1927727" target="_blank">Micron / Numonyx / ST NAND01gw3b2cn6</a> NAND package.

				<p>Having concrete evidence of a boot failure would be nice, and the only way to truly know if there are problems at boot is if you could access a live serial output monitor / terminal / bitstream while the ST Spear600 is loading the initial bootloader. Luckily, this oscilloscope series has been around for some time and the clever folks on the eevblog have <a href="https://www.eevblog.com/forum/testgear/dsox2000-and-3000-series-licence-have-anyone-tried-to-hack-that-scope/msg3028486/#msg3028486" target="_blank">poked around</a> and found out the (10) pin 0.1in header near the DDR2 memory of the main ST Spear600 is indeed a UART header. 
				</p>
				<a href="https://i.imgur.com/yYMV75t.jpeg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/yYMV75t.jpeg"></a>	
				<p>
				This header varies in orientation and location between scope mainboards so let's find the pinout another way. With the oscilloscope unplugged, put a multimeter in continuity mode with one probe against the shell / any PCB screw terminal and find which pins on the 10 pin header is GND. Two of the pins should be gnd. This scope is based around an ARM CPU. Arm based chips run on 3.3v, thus 3.3v logic levels. The <a href="https://www.st.com/content/ccc/resource/technical/document/datasheet/2b/0d/d3/41/dd/ec/48/79/CD00248440.pdf/files/CD00248440.pdf/jcr:content/translations/en.CD00248440.pdf" target="_blank">SPEAr600 datasheet</a> above confirms this. The scope design engineers are awesome and left in plenty of silkscreen labels across the PCB, so find test point VP3V3, the 3.3v rail, and check for continuity with any of the 10 pins. You will find that one pin is indeed 3.3v rail leaving 7 unknown pins.
				</p>

				UART is an Asynchronous communication so only two pins, (Tx) send and (Rx) receive, are needed. Which of the 7 are Tx and Rx? The best way to find out is with a logic analyzer and this excellent guide from <a href="https://riverloopsecurity.com/blog/2020/01/hw-101-uart/" target="_blank">River Loop Security</a>. I happen to have an MSO scope on hand, so why not flex some electrons?

				<p>
					Before plugging anything into fancy test equipment, it's a good idea to check the reference manual. Two important bits of info about the 2000a / 3000a MSO capabilities: the MSO adapter can accept low power signals up to 40v, but it offers no input protection when the host oscilloscope is off. Thus, if the DUT (Device Under Test) has a short of some kind near the area of probing, and the host oscilloscope is not powered, there's a good chance you've just damaged the Maxim MAX9201 comparators in the logic analyzer section of your scope! It's worth checking all 10 pins for voltages outside the MSO operational range. 
				</p>
				<a href="https://salvagedcircuitry.com/img/2000a-nand-recovery/P1043425.JPG"><img src="https://salvagedcircuitry.com/img/2000a-nand-recovery/med/P1043425.JPG"></a>		
				<p>
					The 0.1in pitch header sure makes connecting the mini clip grabbers on the MSO adapter easy. The MSO adapter can do 16 channels on a 3000a oscilloscope, but we are only interested in exploring 7 pins. Most scope manufacturers suggest connecting a gnd connection for every second probe wire for best results. In this case I'm just going to use the two easily accessible 0.1in header gnd pins for the adapter and one probe. Make sure to not to add or remove clips when the DUT is powered. 
				</p>
				<a href="https://salvagedcircuitry.com/img/2000a-nand-recovery/P1043428.JPG"><img src="https://salvagedcircuitry.com/img/2000a-nand-recovery/med/P1043428.JPG"></a>	
				<p>
					Right off the bat, it becomes evident that there is plenty of activity on Data line 3, in this case, the exact same pin referenced in the above eevblog uart pinout diagram. Tx has been found. With the UART hex decode function on, UART packets can be decoded from the noise. 
				</p> 
						
				<p>
					Finding which of the remaining 6 pins is the Rx pin is a bit of a headache and will require trial and error. Traditionally, when two UART devices are talking to each other, the RX pin on one device should be connected to the TX pin on the other and vice versa. This creates an additional headache as not every device follows this convention. 
				</p>

		    <h2><a href="#comms" id="comms">Setting up Comms</a></h2>					
				<p>
				UART adapters are plentiful and cheap these days, but the quality and reliability of those found online can vary wildly. I highly suggest grabbing a <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/ftdi-future-technology-devices-international-ltd/TTL-234X-3V3/6823715" target="_blank">genuine 3.3v FTDI cable</a> from digikey because they are an actual supplier and not a re-labeler or importer of clonezone product. I went with two UART cables from amazon and regretted it. Double check and make sure you're using a 3.3V serial adapter, not 5V!
				</p>
						
				<p>
				Connect Rx, Tx and GND from the scope pinout to the USB to UART adapter. It's best to use some 6-8in long dupont cables (0.1in header extension cables) for this to enable complete oscilloscope reassembly. Page 75 of the 3000a service guide shows the proper operational conditions of a 3000a under test, but it is incredibly fiddly and additional cooling will be needed for continued operation. This reflashing process will take nearly 2 hours to complete. Leaving fancy test equipment improperly cooled for that long is silly.

					My go to for legacy hardware communication is to grab an old laptop with dedicated usb 2.0 ports and go to town. I've had issues with 3rd party usb 3.0 hubs. With TeraTerm installed, and the serial port communications adjusted to 115200 baud, I was able to get a U-boot output from the scope on turn on. U-boot only runs for a short amount of time on a working scope and you'll have to hit space very quickly to stop boot. When there's a bootup problem, that's obviously not the case :D.

					It continues until posting a CRC error or something that aborts your booting process. Screenshot / take note of the <b>length</b> of the data in hex that is attempting to transfer under "Completed files(s)." This value is crucial in helping determine what version of the agilent/keysight firmware is running on your scope. Turn off the scope.

					Below is a list of nk.bin firmware internal program size lengths. U-boot looks for a data carrier that contains an nk.bin file that contains the entirety of winCE, which is the main operating system for the 2000a/3000a oscilloscope. Based on the hex value length from your terminal window, acquire the specific firmware version closest to yours in size. Here is my <b><a href="https://salvagedcircuitry.com/docs/2000a-nand-recovery/2000a-3000a-firmware.zip" target="_blank">archive of 2000a / 3000a firmware</a></b> that was downloaded publicly from Keysight's website before the most recent Keysight website redesign nuked them. Start with the firmware value closest to your scope firmware version, but grab the firmware version above and below as a fallback. Hex and Decimal values are missing for certain firmware versions as those are missing from my archive and I cannot verify the lengths. If your length value is between values, you may have to hunt around for an older firmware, ask keysight nicely (they have great support), or ask on the eevblog forums.</p>

					In this case, we will use firmware v2.35 as an example. v2.35 is a .CAB file. Extract nk.bin.comp and infiniiVisionSetup.cab from firmware v2.35 with 7zip. "nk.bin.comp" contains the kernel image and recovering WinCE. "infiniiVisionSetup.cab" contains the oscilloscope application. We want to read the contents of nk.bin.comp to determine the size of the winCE boot image in each version of the agilent firmware and find the one closest in size that matches our present scope. Create a directory that contains the extracted nk.bin.comp, infiniiVisionSetup.cab and all of the extracted files from <b><a href="https://salvagedcircuitry.com/docs/2000a-nand-recovery/nkbintools.zip" target="_blank">nkbintools.zip</a></b>. Run CMD.exe at that folder location. Use bincompress.exe (included in nkbintools.zip) to decompress nk.bin.comp to nk.bin: <code>bincompress /d nk.bin.comp nk.bin</code>. Use viewbin.exe to get the info from nk.bin that we will use later: <code>viewbin nk.bin</code>. Here's the results. under "Image Start = 0x80361000, <b>length = 0x013064D4</b>" length is the value you seek.

					The length of mine was 0x1248684 or firmware 02.30.2013040502. I only had firmware 02.30.2013032600 on hand, but it was close enough that it worked! Using the data we got from viewbin.exe, with the same CMD window open, convert the nk.bin into the nk.nb0 (the binary) with cvrtbin.exe which will be uploaded later. <code>cvrtbin.exe -r -a 0x80361000 -w 32 -l 0x013064D4 nk.bin</code>. This will create a nk.nb0 in the same folder. Check it exists and remember the location. Run TeraTerm with the same serial port parameters: 115200 baud, 8, N, 1. Hold your keyboard space bar and turn on the scope. This will interrupt the U-boot bootloader, showing a prompt:

					With the bootloader stopped, let's start the upload process. U-boot Loady function lets you load a binary file over a serial line (ymodem mode). If you are curious for all the loady modes, type <code>p500&gt; help loady</code>. To use Loady, the function will look like: loady [ offset ] [ baud ]. This will load a binary file over a serial line with offset 'off' and baud rate 'baud.' At the prompt, type: <code>p500&gt; loady 0x0361000 115200</code>. Note from FrankBuss: In case you wonder about the 0x80361000 and 0x361000 difference: this is because of physical and virtual memory addresses. Fortunately, the mapping is really easy in this case. The prompt should spit out: <code>## Ready for binary (ymodem) download to 0x00361000 at 115200 bps...</code>

				<p>
					The "CCCC" will continue until you start to send a file, or a timeout happens after a couple of minutes, maybe. In Tera Term go to File-&gt; Transfer-&gt; YMODEM-&gt;Send... and open the nk.nb0 that you have prepared beforehand. This transfer takes about 45 minutes. YMODEM is a fast protocol, but the serial connection is 1000 times slower compared with a 100BaseT.
				</p>
				<p>
					YMODEM transfer can sometimes fail. Mine failed on me a few times. All of those times, the "total size" in bytes transferred was nowhere near the size from the above table. In my case below, the first nk.nb0 transfer was 1053696 bytes. The second transfer was 6907904 Bytes. It was supposed to be 19170948 bytes. This was likely due to clonezone ftdi uart cables.

				<p>
					I originally used v2.35 firmware (19948756 bytes) which was the wrong size nk.nb0 file and it caused a hang on "starting application at 0x00362000" just as above.

				<p> 
					While waiting, prepare a USB flash drive. Use a small USB flash drive formatted in FAT and ideally less than 8gb. 128mb is likely the smallest for comfort. My scope randomly failed and rebooted with a 16gb sandisk usb3.0 extreme card. Avoid USB to SD card adapters.
				</p>
				<p>
					WinCE CAB Manager 3.0 can extract the files from infiniiVisionSetup.cab, but I was unable to find them. Fortunately, in the nkbintools.zip there is a Python script, dosetup.py, that does the job. The steps are:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>install Python 2.x.x</li>
					<li>Decompress infiniiVisionSetup.cab into an empty folder. you will get many files with scrambled names.</li>
					<li>copy dosetup.py into the same folder</li>
					<li>run python dosetup.py or simply double click on dosetup.py. Python instructions are duplicated in the readme.txt in the .zip</li>
				</ul>
		    <h2><a href="#usb" id="usb">Setting up the USB Flash Drive</a></h2>

					Now you have the contents of infiniiVisionSetup.cab exploded in a tree. The next step is to copy this folder and its contents to a USB flash drive. The folder structure is found <a href="https://www.eevblog.com/forum/testgear/dsox2000-and-3000-series-licence-have-anyone-tried-to-hack-that-scope/msg364171/#msg364171" target="_blank">here</a> but revised below:

					The last step: Use the go U-boot command to execute the kernel just downloaded. Cross your fingers, pray, say thanks to James Clerk Maxwell, or whatever your belief recommend, and type at the prompt: <code>p500&gt; go 0x00362000</code>. The terminal should start echoing a long list of messages, starting with...

				396 lines after the "go" command, you should see the last line: <code>InfiniiVision is running</code> and your scope is running!
				</p>

					Once your scope is resurrected and boots properly, it is imperative that you update to a bootloader-patched firmware. This firmware contains a self-recovery mode, new NAND drivers and memory access algorithm. Do not “unpack” or “unzip” the stock .cab firmware file. Leave it be. Since your oscilloscope is likely running a pre-2.41 firmware, make sure the file has a .cab extension. Scopes running pre-2.41 firmware cannot read .ksx files. To Install: Place the file on a USB flash drive, plug it into front scope USB. Press [Utility] &gt; File Explorer, select the file, then, press Load File. It will take ~10 minutes to install.

					When the wrong USB folder structure occurs, the terminal will hang with an "Ending ProcessStartupFolder." This can be due to a change in folder structure where some early boot structures do not use the <code>/secure/</code> folder.

					If the go command fails, you will have to re-upload the nk.nb0 file through UART and try again. This means another 45min waiting for the nk.nb0 to transfer. The go command can fail for a few reasons: wrong size USB flash card, wrong USB flash formatting, wrong length nk.bin file, or the wrong usb directory setup.

The SPEAr600 has a built-in USB PHY and 32 Kbytes of BootROM which is accessible via USB boot. The <a href="https://salvagedcircuitry.com/docs/2000a-nand-recovery/spear300-ref.pdf" target="_blank">SPEAr300 reference manual</a> further details how to access BootROM. It seems a bit complicated to enter BootRom as if any portion of U-boot loads, BootRom cannot be accessed. However, with enough <a href="https://www.eevblog.com/forum/testgear/dsox2000-and-3000-series-licence-have-anyone-tried-to-hack-that-scope/msg5188032/#msg5188032" target="_blank">persistence and the source of the ST flashing utility</a>, BootROM is reachable.

					Historically, HP and Agilent issued service notes whenever significant faults or problems occurred with manufactured test equipment. These were <a href="https://salvagedcircuitry.com/docs/2000a-nand-recovery/service-note-DSOX3014A-03.pdf" target="_blank">public PDFs</a> stating the specific solution to the problem and if the solution required returning the instrument to the mothership for repair. Keysight seems to be more hush-hush about these service notes. One was finally released about the NAND issue, but it seems more of a leak than a public release. In fairness, Keysight honored the NAND repair free of charge (<a href="https://www.eevblog.com/forum/testgear/dsox2000-and-3000-series-licence-have-anyone-tried-to-hack-that-scope/msg5273628/#msg5273628" target="_blank">still does?</a>) and they provide a free calibration with each repair. The end date for the repair service was stated as 2019, 11 years after the 2000a was introduced and 8 years after the 3000a was released. That's pretty reasonable - even <i>generous</i> to some extent, but test equipment is usually held to a high standard. Unfortunately, the entirety of the 2000a, 3000a and 4000a range is impacted. The 4000a seems to have less reported cases on eevblog though. Yes, we all still wish Bill &amp; Dave were at the reins.

					Sifting through the <a href="https://salvagedcircuitry.com/docs/2000a-nand-recovery/service-note-MSOX3024A-05.pdf" target="_blank">MSOX3024A-05</a> service note, Keysight isn't too happy with the corruption failure: "Under no circumstances is the labor to exceed 90 minutes." I can imagine that Keysight instructs technicians to replace the entire acquisition board and do a standard calibration to forgo a recovery process or re-flashing procedure. A standard calibration alone will take about an hour, especially since you need to <a href="https://salvagedcircuitry.com/docs/2000a-nand-recovery/Service-Guide-2000-3000-X-Series.pdf" target="_blank">"let the oscilloscope and test equipment warm up for at least 30 minutes"</a> before starting the calibration procedure. Edit: It looks like I <a href="https://www.eevblog.com/forum/testgear/keysight-msox3104t-start-up-problem!/msg1931386/#msg1931386" target="_blank">guessed right</a>!				
				</p>
		    <h2><a href="#corruption" id="corruption">NAND Corruption?</a></h2>	
				<p>
					Well, what happened here? Was is actually hardware NAND corruption? Was it some kind of run-time program fault the caused boot failure? This was indeed actual hardware nand corruption! The keysight service note states: "This firmware update re-formats the memory to eliminate a corruption condition. Firmware version 2.40 and higher include new NAND memory drivers and an enhanced NAND memory access algorithm that will greatly reduce the possibility of a corruption event."
				</p>
				<p>
					Looking at the above teardown, it's evident that the flash controller is embedded in the spear600 micro, since there's no dedicated flash controller anywhere on the pcb. The spear600 and spear300 reference guides denote a "Flexible static memory controller (FSMC) supporting parallel NAND Flash memory interface, ONFI 1.0 support, internal 1-bit ECC or external 4-bit ECC features." ONFI here is irrelevant, but ECC (Error correction code) was most definitely implemented. What is troubling is no mention of wear leveling or garbage collection anywhere in either ST document.

				<blockquote>
				  	<p>Flash memory bits wear out after 100,000 to 1,000,000 writes. Thus, file systems must keep track of the number of writes and have a strategy to avoid wearing out storage, such as by moving popular data.</p>
				  	<p>—Patterson &amp; Hennessy, <cite>P.23 Computer Organization and Design 5E</cite></p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					Was the same part of the nand re-written at every boot? Could this have contributed to the problem? Possibly. The datasheet states the ECC implemented was a Hamming-based code which will check for data consistency, but whether or not the Hamming-based code implemented cell reallocation is unknown. This is a bit outside of my expertise, but it seems that wear leveling algorithms have improved substantially since the proliferation of inexpensive nand and it's possible what was originally implemented was very rudimentary as these parts were from the early 2000s.
				</p>
				<blockquote>
				  	<p>Current wear-leveling algorithms remap the data to another physical location rather than erasing the data and then programming in-place. The flash controller maintains a list of free blocks that have been erased in background through garbage collection and are ready for programming. Whenever a write operation is requested, the controller’s wear-leveling algorithm selects a free block and programs it directly, remapping the logical block address to the new physical block.</p>
				  	
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					Were the efforts by Keysight engineers enough to mitigate the problem? I think so. While you can reallocate bad sectors with an erase / re-format, you cannot truly fix them. If efforts are taken to remap data to known good sectors, and there is a a sufficiently large enough volume of available space on the nand, this should be an appropriate stop-gap solution. I am curious if the current <a href="https://www.keysight.com/in/en/products/oscilloscopes/infiniivision-2-4-channel-digital-oscilloscopes/infiniivision-3000g-x-series-oscilloscopes.html" target="_blank">3000g</a> series, which is a close cousin to the 3000a, has a larger nand package because of these reasons, or simply because supply and demand have forced the smaller, older tsop nand packages into pricing obsolesce. More importantly, <a href="https://www.eevblog.com/forum/testgear/agilent-dsox2024-won_t-boot/msg947382/#msg947382" target="_blank">Keysight states</a> that they added a recovery partition with a user displayable prompt so if the scope doesn't boot, it should at least be recoverable. This is a huge welcome.

					As to why the 4000a shows up with the nand problem less often on the eevblog forums, it could be due to the larger capacity VFBGA packaged <a href="https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Micron/MT29F2G08ABAEAH4E?qs=rrS6PyfT74fEYgvoa7yprQ%3D%3D" target="_blank">MT29F2G08ABAEAH4:E</a> nand chip being utilized or simply because these instruments are in a higher price bracket and don't show up in the hands of folks with home electronics labs and eevblog forum accounts :D.

		<p>Culture is increasingly mediated through algorithms. These algorithms have splintered the organization of culture, a result of states and tech companies vying for influence over mass audiences. One byproduct of this splintering is a shift from imperfect but broad cultural narratives to a proliferation of niche groups, who are defined by ideology or aesthetics instead of nationality or geography. This change reflects a material shift in the relationship between collective identity and power, and illustrates how states no longer have exclusive domain over either. Today, both power and culture are increasingly corporate.</p>
<p>Blending Stewart Brand and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, McKenzie Wark writes in <em>A Hacker Manifesto</em> that “information wants to be free but is everywhere in chains.”<a id="b1" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> Sounding simultaneously harmless and revolutionary, Wark’s assertion as part of her analysis of the role of what she terms “the hacker class” in creating new world orders points to one of the main ideas that became foundational to the reorganization of power in the era of the internet: that “information wants to be free.” This credo, itself a co-option of Brand’s influential original assertion in a conversation with Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak at the 1984 Hackers Conference and later in his 1987 book <em>The Media Lab: Inventing the Future at MIT</em>, became a central ethos for early internet inventors, activists,<a id="b2" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> and entrepreneurs. Ultimately, this notion was foundational in the construction of the era we find ourselves in today: an era in which internet companies dominate public and private life. These companies used the supposed desire of information to be free as a pretext for building platforms that allowed people to connect and share content. Over time, this development helped facilitate the definitive power transfer of our time, from states to corporations.</p>
<p>This power transfer was enabled in part by personal data and its potential power to influence people’s behavior—a critical goal in both politics and business. The pioneers of the digital advertising industry claimed that the more data they had about people, the more they could influence their behavior. In this way, they used data as a proxy for influence, and built the business case for mass digital surveillance. The big idea was that data can accurately model, predict, and influence the behavior of everyone—from consumers to voters to criminals. In reality, the relationship between data and influence is fuzzier, since influence is hard to measure or quantify. But the idea of data as a proxy for influence is appealing precisely because data is quantifiable, whereas influence is vague. The business model of Google Ads, Facebook, Experian, and similar companies works because data is cheap to gather, and the effectiveness of the resulting influence is difficult to measure. The credo was “Build the platform, harvest the data…then profit.” By 2006, a major policy paper could ask, “Is Data the New Oil?”<a id="b3" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>The digital platforms that have succeeded most in attracting and sustaining mass attention—Facebook, TikTok, Instagram—have become cultural. The design of these platforms dictates the circulation of customs, symbols, stories, values, and norms that bind people together in protocols of shared identity. Culture, as articulated through human systems such as art and media, is a kind of social infrastructure. Put differently, culture is the operating system of society.</p>
<p>Like any well-designed operating system, culture is invisible to most people most of the time. Hidden in plain sight, we make use of it constantly without realizing it. As an operating system, culture forms the base infrastructure layer of societal interaction, facilitating communication, cooperation, and interrelations. Always evolving, culture is elastic: we build on it, remix it, and even break it.</p>
<p>Culture can also be hacked—subverted for specific advantage.<a id="b4" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> If culture is like an operating system, then to hack it is to exploit the design of that system to gain unauthorized control and manipulate it towards a specific end. This can be for good or for bad. The morality of the hack depends on the intent and actions of the hacker.</p>
<p>When businesses hack culture to gather data, they are not necessarily destroying or burning down social fabrics and cultural infrastructure. Rather, they reroute the way information and value circulate, for the benefit of their shareholders. This isn’t new. There have been culture hacks before. For example, by lending it covert support, the CIA hacked the abstract expressionism movement to promote the idea that capitalism was friendly to high culture.<a id="b5" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> Advertising appropriated the folk-cultural images of Santa Claus and the American cowboy to sell Coca-Cola and Marlboro cigarettes, respectively. In Mexico, after the revolution of 1910, the ruling party hacked muralist works, aiming to construct a unifying national narrative.</p>
<p>Culture hacks under digital capitalism are different. Whereas traditional propaganda goes in one direction—from government to population, or from corporation to customers—the internet-surveillance business works in two directions: extracting data while pushing engaging content. The extracted data is used to determine what content a user would find most engaging, and that engagement is used to extract more data, and so on. The goal is to keep as many users as possible on platforms for as long as possible, in order to sell access to those users to advertisers. Another difference between traditional propaganda and digital platforms is that the former aims to craft messages with broad appeal, while the latter hyper-personalizes content for individual users.</p>
<p>The rise of Chinese-owned TikTok has triggered heated debate in the US about the potential for a foreign-owned platform to influence users by manipulating what they see. Never mind that US corporations have used similar tactics for years. While the political commitments of platform owners are indeed consequential—Chinese-owned companies are in service to the Chinese Communist Party, while US-owned companies are in service to business goals—the far more pressing issue is that both have virtually unchecked surveillance power. They are both reshaping societies by hacking culture to extract data and serve content. Funny memes, shocking news, and aspirational images all function similarly: they provide companies with unprecedented access to societies’ collective dreams and fears.<a id="b6" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> By determining who sees what when and where, platform owners influence how societies articulate their understanding of themselves.</p>
<p>Tech companies want us to believe that algorithmically determined content is effectively neutral: that it merely reflects the user’s behavior and tastes back at them. In 2021, Instagram head Adam Mosseri wrote a post on the company’s blog entitled “Shedding More Light on How Instagram Works.” A similar window into TikTok’s functioning was provided by journalist Ben Smith in his article “How TikTok Reads Your Mind.”<a id="b7" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> Both pieces boil down to roughly the same idea: “We use complicated math to give you more of what your behavior shows us you really like.”</p>
<p>This has two consequences. First, companies that control what users see in a nontransparent way influence how we perceive the world. They can even shape our personal relationships. Second, by optimizing algorithms for individual attention, a sense of culture as common ground is lost. Rather than binding people through shared narratives, digital platforms fracture common cultural norms into self-reinforcing filter bubbles.<a id="b8" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>This fragmentation of shared cultural identity reflects how the data surveillance business is rewriting both the established order of global power, and social contracts between national governments and their citizens. Before the internet, in the era of the modern state, imperfect but broad narratives shaped distinct cultural identities; “Mexican culture” was different from “French culture,” and so on. These narratives were designed to carve away an “us” from “them,” in a way that served government aims. Culture has long been understood to operate within the envelope of nationality, as exemplified by the organization of museum collections according to the nationality of artists, or by the Venice Biennale—the Olympics of the art world, with its national pavilions format.</p>
<p>National culture, however, is about more than museum collections or promoting tourism. It broadly legitimizes state power by emotionally binding citizens to a self-understood identity. This identity helps ensure a continuing supply of military recruits to fight for the preservation of the state. Sociologist James Davison Hunter, who popularized the phrase “culture war,” stresses that culture is used to justify violence to defend these identities.<a id="b9" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> We saw an example of this on January 6, 2021, with the storming of the US Capitol. Many of those involved were motivated by a desire to defend a certain idea of cultural identity they believed was under threat.</p>
<p>Military priorities were also entangled with the origins of the tech industry. The US Department of Defense funded ARPANET, the first version of the internet. But the internet wouldn’t have become what it is today without the influence of both West Coast counterculture and small-l libertarianism, which saw the early internet as primarily a space to connect and play. One of the first digital game designers was Bernie De Koven, founder of the Games Preserve Foundation. A noted game theorist, he was inspired by Stewart Brand’s interest in “play-ins” to start a center dedicated to play. Brand had envisioned play-ins as an alternative form of protest against the Vietnam War; they would be their own “soft war” of subversion against the military.<a id="b10" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> But the rise of digital surveillance as the business model of nascent tech corporations would hack this anti-establishment spirit, turning instruments of social cohesion and connection into instruments of control.</p>
<p>It’s this counterculture side of tech’s lineage, which advocated for the social value of play, that attuned the tech industry to the utility of culture. We see the commingling of play and military control in Brand’s Whole Earth Catalog, which was a huge influence on early tech culture. Described as “a kind of Bible for counterculture technology,” the Whole Earth Catalog was popular with the first generation of internet engineers, and established crucial “assumptions about the ideal relationships between information, technology, and community.”<a id="b11" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> Brand’s 1972 Rolling Stone article “Spacewar: Fantastic Life and Symbolic Death Among the Computer” further emphasized how rudimentary video games were central to the engineering community. These games were wildly popular at leading engineering research centers: Stanford, MIT, ARPA, Xerox, and others. This passion for gaming as an expression of technical skills and a way for hacker communities to bond led to the development of MUD (Multi-User Dungeon) programs, which enabled multiple people to communicate and collaborate online simultaneously.</p>
<p>The first MUD was developed in 1978 by engineers who wanted to play fantasy games online. It applied the early-internet ethos of decentralism and personalization to video games, making it a precursor to massive multiplayer online role-playing games and modern chat rooms and Facebook groups. Today, these video games and game-like simulations—now a commercial industry worth around $200 billion<a id="b12" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a>—serve as important recruitment and training tools for the military.<a id="b13" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> The history of the tech industry and culture is full of this tension between the internet as an engineering plaything and as a surveillance commodity.</p>
<p>Historically, infrastructure businesses—like railroad companies in the nineteenth-century US—have always wielded considerable power. Internet companies that are also infrastructure businesses combine commercial interests with influence over national and individual security. As we transitioned from railroad tycoons connecting physical space to cloud computing companies connecting digital space, the pace of technological development put governments at a disadvantage. The result is that corporations now lead the development of new tech (a reversal from the ARPANET days), and governments follow, struggling to modernize public services in line with the new tech. Companies like Microsoft are functionally providing national cybersecurity. Starlink, Elon Musk’s satellite internet service, is a consumer product that facilitates military communications for the war in Ukraine. Traditionally, this kind of service had been restricted to selected users and was the purview of states.<a id="b14" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> Increasingly, it is clear that a handful of transnational companies are using their technological advantages to consolidate economic and political power to a degree previously afforded to only great-power nations.</p>
<p>Worse, since these companies operate across multiple countries and regions, there is no regulatory body with the jurisdiction to effectively constrain them. This transition of authority from states to corporations and the nature of surveillance as the business model of the internet rewrites social contracts between national governments and their citizens. But it also also blurs the lines among citizen, consumer, and worker. An example of this are Google’s Recaptchas, visual image puzzles used in cybersecurity to “prove” that the user is a human and not a bot. While these puzzles are used by companies and governments to add a layer of security to their sites, their value is in how they record a user’s input in solving the puzzles to train Google’s computer vision AI systems. Similarly, Microsoft provides significant cybersecurity services to governments while it also trains its AI models on citizens’ conversations with Bing.<a id="b15" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> Under this dyanmic, when citizens use digital tools and services provided by tech companies, often to access government webpages and resources, they become de facto free labor for the tech companies providing them. The value generated by this citizen-user-laborer stays with the company, as it is used to develop and refine their products. In this new blurred reality, the relationships among corporations, governments, power, and identity are shifting. Our social and cultural infrastructure suffers as a result, creating a new kind of technical debt of social and cultural infrustructure.</p>
<p>In the field of software development, technical debt refers to the future cost of ignoring a near-term engineering problem.<a id="b16" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> Technical debt grows as engineers implement short-term patches or workarounds, choosing to push the more expensive and involved re-engineering fixes for later. This debt accrues over time, to be paid back in the long term. The result of a decision to solve an immediate problem at the expense of the long-term one effectively mortgages the future in favor of an easier present. In terms of cultural and social infrastructure, we use the same phrase to refer to the long-term costs that result from avoiding or not fully addressing social needs in the present. More than a mere mistake, socio-technical debt stems from willfully not addressing a social problem today and leaving a much larger problem to be addressed in the future.</p>
<p>For example, this kind of technical debt was created by the cratering of the news industry, which relied on social media to drive traffic—and revenue—to news websites. When social media companies adjusted their algorithms to deprioritize news, traffic to news sites plummeted, causing an existential crisis for many publications.<a id="b17" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> Now, traditional news stories make up only 3 percent of social media content. At the same time, 66 percent of people ages eighteen to twenty-four say they get their “news” from TikTok, Facebook, and Twitter.<a id="b18" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> To be clear, Facebook did not accrue technical debt when it swallowed the news industry. We as a society are dealing with technical debt in the sense that we are being forced to pay the social cost of allowing them to do that.</p>
<p>One result of this shift in information consumption as a result of changes to the cultural infrastructure of social media is the rise in polarization and radicalism. So by neglecting to adequately regulate tech companies and support news outlets in the near term, our governments have paved the way for social instability in the long term. We as a society also have to find and fund new systems to act as a watchdog over both corporate and governmental power.</p>
<p>Another example of socio-technical debt is the slow erosion of main streets and malls by e-commerce.<a id="b19" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> These places used to be important sites for physical gathering, which helped the shops and restaurants concentrated there stay in business. But e-commerce and direct-to-consumer trends have undermined the economic viability of main streets and malls, and have made it much harder for small businesses to survive. The long-term consequence of this to society is the hollowing out of town centers and the loss of spaces for physical gathering—which we will all have to pay for eventually.</p>
<p>The faltering finances of museums will also create long-term consequences for society as a whole, especially in the US, where Museums mostly depend on private donors to cover operational costs. But a younger generation of philanthropists is shifting its giving priorities away from the arts, leading to a funding crisis at some institutions.<a id="b20" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>One final example: libraries. NYU Sociologist Eric Klinenberg called libraries “the textbook example of social infrastructure in action.”<a id="b21" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> But today they are stretched to the breaking point, like museums, main streets, and news media. In New York City, Mayor Eric Adams has proposed a series of severe budget cuts to the city’s library system over the past year, despite having seen a spike in usage recently. The steepest cuts were eventually retracted, but most libraries in the city have still had to cancel social programs and cut the number of days they’re open.<a id="b22" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> As more and more spaces for meeting in real life close, we increasingly turn to digital platforms for connection to replace them. But these virtual spaces are optimized for shareholder returns, not public good.</p>
<p>Just seven companies—Alphabet (the parent company of Google), Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla—drove 60 percent of the gains of the S&amp;P stock market index in 2023.<a id="b23" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> Four—Alibaba, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft—deliver the majority of cloud services.<a id="b24" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> These companies have captured the delivery of digital and physical goods and services. Everything involved with social media, cloud computing, groceries, and medicine is trapped in their flywheels, because the constellation of systems that previously put the brakes on corporate power, such as monopoly laws, labor unions, and news media, has been eroded. Product dependence and regulatory capture have further undermined the capacity of states to respond to the rise in corporate hard and soft power. Lock-in and other anticompetitive corporate behavior have prevented market mechanisms from working properly. As democracy falls into deeper crisis with each passing year, policy and culture are increasingly bent towards serving corporate interest. The illusion that business, government, and culture are siloed sustains this status quo.</p>
<p>Our digitized global economy has made us all participants in the international data trade, however reluctantly. Though we are aware of the privacy invasions and social costs of digital platforms, we nevertheless participate in these systems because we feel as though we have no alternative—which itself is partly the result of tech monopolies and the lack of competition.</p>
<p>Now, the ascendence of AI is thrusting big data into a new phase and new conflicts with social contracts. The development of bigger, more powerful AI models means more demand for data. Again, massive wholesale extractions of culture are at the heart of these efforts.<a id="b25" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> As AI researchers and artists Kate Crawford and Vladan Joler explain in the catalog to their exhibition Calculating Empires, AI developers require “the entire history of human knowledge and culture … The current lawsuits over generative systems like GPT and Stable Diffusion highlight how completely dependent AI systems are on extracting, enclosing, and commodifying the entire history of cognitive and creative labor.”<a id="b26" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>Permitting internet companies to hack the systems in which culture is produced and circulates is a short-term trade-off that has proven to have devastating long-term consequences. When governments give tech companies unregulated access to our social and cultural infrastructure, the social contract becomes biased towards their profit. When we get immediate catharsis through sharing memes or engaging in internet flamewars, real protest is muzzled. We are increasing our collective socio-technical debt by ceding our social and cultural infrastructure to tech monopolies.</p>
<p>Cultural expression is fundamental to what makes us human. It’s an impulse, innate to us as a species, and this impulse will continue to be a gold mine to tech companies. There is evidence that AI models trained on synthetic data—data produced by other AI models rather than humans—can corrupt these models, causing them to return false or nonsensical answers to queries.<a id="b27" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> So as AI-produced data floods the internet, data that is guaranteed to have been derived from humans becomes more valuable. In this context, our human nature, compelling us to make and express culture, is the dream of digital capitalism. We become a perpetual motion machine churning out free data. Beholden to shareholders, these corporations see it as their fiduciary duty—a moral imperative even—to extract value from this cultural life.</p>
<p>We are in a strange transition. The previous global order, in which states wielded ultimate authority, hasn’t quite died. At the same time, large corporations have stepped in to deliver some of the services abandoned by states, but at the price of privacy and civic well-being. Increasingly, corporations provide consistent, if not pleasant, economic and social organization. Something similar occurred during the Gilded Age in the US (1870s–1890s). But back then, the influence of robber barons was largely constrained to the geographies in which they operated, and their services (like the railroad) were not previously provided by states. In our current transitionary period, public life worldwide is being reimagined in accordance with corporate values. Amidst a tug-of-war between the old state-centric world and the emerging capital-centric world, there is a growing radicalism fueled partly by frustration over social and personal needs going unmet under a transnational order that is maximized for profit rather than public good.</p>
<p>Culture is increasingly divorced from national identity in our globalized, fragmented world. On the positive side, this decoupling can make culture more inclusive of marginalized people. Other groups, however, may perceive this new status quo as a threat, especially those facing a loss of privilege. The rise of white Christian nationalism shows that the right still regards national identity and culture as crucial—as potent tools in the struggle to build political power, often through anti-democratic means. This phenomenon shows that the separation of cultural identity from national identity doesn’t negate the latter. Instead, it creates new political realities and new orders of power.</p>
<p>Nations issuing passports still behave as though they are the definitive arbiters of identity. But culture today—particularly the multiverse of internet cultures—exposes how this is increasingly untrue. With government discredited as an ultimate authority, and identity less and less connected to nationality, we can find a measure of hope for navigating the current transition in the fact that culture is never static. New forms of resistance are always emerging. But we must ask ourselves: Have the tech industry’s overwhelming surveillance powers rendered subversion impossible? Or does its scramble to gather all the world’s data offer new possibilities to hack the system?</p>

<h3>Pressemitteilung</h3>


<p>18. Juni 2024</p>




<p>Ende 2019 begann die zuvor unauffällige Galaxie SDSS1335+0728 plötzlich heller zu leuchten als je zuvor. Um den Ursachen auf den Grund zu gehen, haben Astronomen Daten von mehreren Weltraum- und Bodenobservatorien, darunter das Very Large Telescope (VLT) der Europäischen Südsternwarte (ESO), verwendet, um die Helligkeitsschwankungen der Galaxie nachzuverfolgen. In einer heute veröffentlichten Studie kommen sie zu dem Schluss, dass sie bisher noch nie beobachtete Veränderungen in einer Galaxie sehen – wahrscheinlich das Ergebnis des plötzlichen Erwachens des massereichen Schwarzen Lochs in ihrem Zentrum.</p>
<p>„<em>Stellen Sie sich vor, Sie beobachten eine weit entfernte Galaxie seit Jahren, und sie schien immer ruhig und inaktiv zu sein</em>“, sagt Paula Sánchez Sáez, eine Astronomin der ESO in Deutschland und Hauptautorin der Studie, die zur Veröffentlichung in <em>Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics</em> angenommen wurde. „<em>Plötzlich zeigt ihr [Kern] dramatische Veränderungen in der Helligkeit, die sich von allen typischen Ereignissen, die wir bisher gesehen haben, unterscheiden.</em>“ Genau das ist mit SDSS1335+0728 passiert, das nun als „aktiver galaktischer Kern“ (AGN) eingestuft wird – eine helle, kompakte Region, die von einem massereichen Schwarzen Loch angetrieben wird – nachdem es sich im Dezember 2019 dramatisch aufgehellt hatte <a href="#1">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>Einige Phänomene, wie Supernova-Explosionen oder das durch Gezeitenkräfte verursachte Auseinanderbrechen von Sternen, bei denen ein Stern einem Schwarzen Loch zu nahe kommt und auseinandergerissen wird, können dazu führen, dass Galaxien plötzlich heller leuchten. Diese Helligkeitsschwankungen dauern jedoch in der Regel nur einige Dutzend oder höchstens einige Hundert Tage an. SDSS1335+0728 wird auch heute noch heller, mehr als vier Jahre, nachdem zum ersten Mal beobachtet wurde, dass sie „aufleuchtet“. Weiterhin sind die in der Galaxie, die sich 300 Millionen Lichtjahre entfernt im Sternbild Jungfrau befindet, festgestellten Schwankungen anders als alle bisher beobachteten und weisen die Astronomen auf eine andere Erklärung hin.</p>
<p>Das Team versuchte, diese Helligkeitsschwankungen mithilfe einer Kombination aus Archivdaten und neuen Beobachtungen von mehreren Standorten, darunter dem X-Shooter-Instrument am VLT der ESO in der chilenischen Atacama-Wüste, zu verstehen <a href="#2">[2]</a>. Beim Vergleich der vor und nach Dezember 2019 aufgenommenen Daten stellten sie fest, dass SDSS1335+0728 jetzt viel mehr Licht im ultravioletten, optischen und infraroten Wellenlängenbereich abstrahlt. Die Galaxie begann im Februar 2024 auch mit der Aussendung von Röntgenstrahlen. „Dieses Verhalten ist beispiellos“, sagt Sánchez Sáez, die auch mit dem Millennium Institute of Astrophysics (MAS) in Chile verbunden ist.</p>
<p>„<em>Die naheliegendste Erklärung für dieses Phänomen ist, dass wir beobachten, wie der [Kern] der Galaxie anfängt, (...) Aktivität zu zeigen</em>“, sagt die Co-Autorin Lorena Hernández García vom MAS und der Universität Valparaíso in Chile. „<em>Wenn das stimmt, wäre dies das erste Mal, dass wir die Aktivierung eines massereichen Schwarzen Lochs in Echtzeit beobachten.</em>“</p>
<p>Massereiche Schwarze Löcher – mit Massen, die über hunderttausend Mal größer sind als die unserer Sonne – existieren im Zentrum der meisten Galaxien, einschließlich der Milchstraße. „<em>Diese Giganten schlafen normalerweise und sind nicht direkt sichtbar</em>“, erklärt der Co-Autor Claudio Ricci von der Diego-Portales-Universität, ebenfalls in Chile. „<em>Im Fall von SDSS1335+0728 konnten wir das Erwachen des massereichen Schwarzen Lochs beobachten, das sich plötzlich das in seiner Umgebung vorhandene Gas einverleibte und sehr hell wurde.</em>“</p>
<p>„<em>Dieser Prozess (...) wurde noch nie zuvor beobachtet</em>“, sagt Hernández García. In früheren Studien wurde zwar berichtet, dass inaktive Galaxien nach mehreren Jahren aktiv werden, doch dies ist das erste Mal, dass der Prozess selbst – das Erwachen des Schwarzen Lochs – in Echtzeit beobachtet wurde. Ricci, der auch mit dem Kavli-Institut für Astronomie und Astrophysik an der Peking-Universität in China verbunden ist, fügt hinzu: „<em>Das könnte auch bei unserem eigenen Sgr A*, dem massereichen Schwarzen Loch (...) im Zentrum unserer Galaxie, passieren</em>“, aber es ist unklar, wie wahrscheinlich dies ist.</p>
<p>Es sind noch weitere Beobachtungen erforderlich, um alternative Erklärungen auszuschließen. Eine andere Möglichkeit ist, dass wir ein ungewöhnlich langsames Ereignis der Gezeitenstörung oder sogar ein neues Phänomen beobachten. Wenn es sich tatsächlich um ein Ereignis der Gezeitenstörung handelt, wäre dies das längste und schwächste Ereignis dieser Art, das jemals beobachtet wurde. „<em>Unabhängig von der Art der Schwankungen liefert [diese Galaxie] wertvolle Informationen darüber, wie Schwarze Löcher wachsen und sich entwickeln</em>“, sagt Sánchez Sáez. „<em>Wir gehen davon aus, dass Instrumente wie [MUSE am VLT oder die Instrumente am zukünftigen Extremely Large Telescope (ELT)] entscheidend zum Verständnis beitragen werden [warum die Galaxie heller wird].</em>“</p>
<h3>Endnoten</h3><p><a name="1"></a>[1] Die ungewöhnlichen Helligkeitsschwankungen der Galaxie SDSS1335+0728 wurden vom Zwicky-Transient-Facility-Teleskop (ZTF) in den USA entdeckt. Anschließend stufte der von Chile aus geleitete Algorithmus Automatic Learning for the Rapid Classification of Events (ALeRCE) SDSS1335+0728 als aktiven Galaxienkern ein.</p>
<p><a name="2"></a>[2] Das Team sammelte Archivdaten von den NASA-Satelliten Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) und Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX), dem Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS), dem Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) und dem eROSITA-Instrument auf dem Spektr-RG-Weltraumobservatorium von IKI und DLR. Neben dem VLT der ESO wurden die Nachbeobachtungen mit dem Southern Astrophysical Research Telescope (SOAR), dem W. M. Keck Observatory und dem Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory und dem Chandra X-ray Observatory der NASA durchgeführt.</p>

<p>Die Europäische Südsternwarte (ESO) befähigt Wissenschaftler*innen weltweit, die Geheimnisse des Universums zum Nutzen aller zu entdecken. Wir entwerfen, bauen und betreiben Observatorien von Weltrang, die Astronominnen und Astronomen nutzen, um spannende Fragen zu beantworten und die Faszination der Astronomie zu wecken, und wir fördern die internationale Zusammenarbeit in der Astronomie. Die ESO wurde 1962 als zwischenstaatliche Organisation gegründet und wird heute von 16 Mitgliedstaaten (Belgien, Dänemark, Deutschland, Frankreich, Finnland, Irland, Italien, den Niederlanden, Österreich, Polen, Portugal, Schweden, der Schweiz, Spanien, der Tschechischen Republik und dem Vereinigten Königreich) sowie dem Gastland Chile und Australien als strategischem Partner unterstützt. Der Hauptsitz der ESO und ihr Besucherzentrum und Planetarium, die ESO Supernova, befinden sich in der Nähe von München in Deutschland, während die chilenische Atacama-Wüste, ein wunderbarer Ort mit einzigartigen Bedingungen für die Himmelsbeobachtung, unsere Teleskope beherbergt. Die ESO betreibt drei Beobachtungsstandorte: La Silla, Paranal und Chajnantor. Am Standort Paranal betreibt die ESO das Very Large Telescope und das dazugehörige Very Large Telescope Interferometer sowie Durchmusterungsteleskope wie z. B. VISTA. Ebenfalls am Paranal wird die ESO das Cherenkov Telescope Array South betreiben, das größte und empfindlichste Gammastrahlen-Observatorium der Welt. Zusammen mit internationalen Partnern betreibt die ESO auf Chajnantor APEX und ALMA, zwei Einrichtungen zur Beobachtung des Himmels im Millimeter- und Submillimeterbereich. Auf dem Cerro Armazones in der Nähe von Paranal bauen wir „das größte Auge der Welt am Himmel“ – das Extremely Large Telescope der ESO. Von unseren Büros in Santiago, Chile, aus unterstützen wir unsere Aktivitäten im Land und arbeiten mit chilenischen Partnern und der Gesellschaft zusammen.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The higher derivatives of motion are rarely discussed in the teaching of classical mechanics of rigid bodies; nevertheless, we experience the effect not only of acceleration, but also of jerk and snap. In this paper we will discuss the third and higher order derivatives of displacement with respect to time, using the trampolines and theme park roller coasters to illustrate this concept. We will also discuss the effects on the human body of different types of acceleration, jerk, snap and higher derivatives, and how they can be used in physics education to further enhance the learning and thus the understanding of classical mechanics concepts.</p><div xmlns:book="http://api.iop.org/Book/1.0/" xmlns:c="http://ns.iop.org/namespaces/content" itemprop="articleBody">
<div data-mobile-collapse=""><p>We are exposed to a wide variety of external motion and movement on a daily basis. From driving a car to catching an elevator, our bodies are repeatedly exposed to external forces acting upon us, leading to acceleration.</p><p>Being exposed to changes in motion and movement can have significant biomechanical effects on the human body and, in general we try to minimise our exposure to movement. Most transportation devices are designed to reduce acceleration as much as is reasonably practicable. Amusement rides on the other hand, are unique in that they are deliberately designed to expose us to large and changing types of motion.</p><p>We are all familiar with the terms displacement, velocity and acceleration. We experience velocity when we move and acceleration when we change the velocity at which we move. Our body does not feel velocity, but only the change of velocity i.e. acceleration, brought about by the force exerted by an object on our body. For example, a passenger in a constantly accelerating car will feel a constant force from the seat on his or her body.</p><p>Excluding the force of gravity that we are all exposed to minute by minute the concept of a constant force is rare in our daily lives. The accelerations that we normally experience and thus feel are not constant. When we are in a car and accelerate as the lights change to green, our acceleration is not constant. In this situation our acceleration is changing, so the motion sensation we are feeling is more likely jerk and even snap since there is a change in the jerk. As concrete illustrations of the concepts, we present in some detail examples for roller coasters and trampolines, using authentic data.</p><p>There is no agreement of the names of higher order derivatives [<a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#ejpaa4184bib1" id="fnref-ejpaa4184bib1">1</a>]. The term snap will be used throughout this paper to denote the fourth derivative of displacement with respect to time. Another name for this fourth derivative is jounce. The fifth and sixth derivatives with respect to time are referred to as crackle and pop respectively.</p></div>
<div data-mobile-collapse=""><p>The terms jerk and snap mean very little to most people, including physicists and engineers. What are jerk and snap? Mathematically jerk is the third derivative of our position with respect to time and snap is the fourth derivative of our position with respect to time.</p><p>Acceleration without jerk is just a consequence of static load. Jerk is felt as the change in force; jerk can be felt as an increasing or decreasing force on the body. Consider the following. Velocity does not suddenly switch on, but instead grows from zero. So, there must be some acceleration involved. Similarly, acceleration does not suddenly switch on, but instead grows from zero. So, there must be some jerk involved. But the jerk does not suddenly switch on, it also grows from zero. So there must be some snap involved. But the snap does not suddenly switch on, it also grows from zero. So, there must be some crackle involved. But the crackle does not suddenly switch on, it also grows from zero. So, there must be some pop involved, and so on.</p><p>We know the terms displacement, <span xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><span><span><img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=" data-src="https://content.cld.iop.org/journals/0143-0807/37/6/065008/revision1/ejpaa4184ieqn1.gif" alt="${\bf{x}}$"></span></span></span>, velocity, <span xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><span><span><img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=" data-src="https://content.cld.iop.org/journals/0143-0807/37/6/065008/revision1/ejpaa4184ieqn2.gif" alt="${\bf{v}}$"></span></span></span>, and acceleration, <span xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><span><span><img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=" data-src="https://content.cld.iop.org/journals/0143-0807/37/6/065008/revision1/ejpaa4184ieqn3.gif" alt="${\bf{a}}$"></span></span></span>, where <span xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><span><span><img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=" data-src="https://content.cld.iop.org/journals/0143-0807/37/6/065008/revision1/ejpaa4184ieqn4.gif" alt="${\bf{v}}={\rm{d}}{\bf{x}}/{\rm{d}}{t}$"></span></span></span>, and <span xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><span><span><img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=" data-src="https://content.cld.iop.org/journals/0143-0807/37/6/065008/revision1/ejpaa4184ieqn5.gif" alt="${\bf{a}}={\rm{d}}{\bf{v}}/{\rm{d}}{t}$"></span></span></span>. A change in velocity must thus be accompanied by a force affecting every part of the body, although the damping of the human body leads to some attenuation of rapid changes.</p><p>Students are taught Newton's second law at school, commonly in the form <span xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><span><span><img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=" data-src="https://content.cld.iop.org/journals/0143-0807/37/6/065008/revision1/ejpaa4184ieqn6.gif" alt="${\bf{F}}=m{\bf{a}}$"></span></span></span>, where <em>m</em> is the mass and <strong>a</strong> is the acceleration. What students are generally not taught is that the precise wording that Newton used was <em>Lex II: Mutationem motus proportionalem esse vi motrici impressae, et fieri secundum lineam rectam qua vis illa imprimitur.</em> (Law II: A change in motion is proportional to the motive force impressed and takes place along the straight line in which that force is impressed.) [<a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#ejpaa4184bib2" id="fnref-ejpaa4184bib2">2</a>]. This wording can also be interpreted as the impulse force where the force acts over a period of time <span xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><span><span><img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=" data-src="https://content.cld.iop.org/journals/0143-0807/37/6/065008/revision1/ejpaa4184ieqn7.gif" alt="${\rm{\Delta }}t$"></span></span></span>. If the force is impulsive it follows that the acceleration cannot be constant (if the mass of the body remains unchanged).</p><p>A change in force leads to a change in acceleration, that can be expressed, e.g. as <strong>j</strong>&nbsp;=&nbsp;d<strong>a</strong>/d<em>t</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;(d<strong>F</strong>/d<em>t</em>)/<em>m</em>, where we have introduced the jerk, <strong>j</strong>.

Below, we consider numerical examples in connection with a few familiar situations.</p></div>
<div data-mobile-collapse=""><p>Most rides that we embark upon such as riding in a lift, catching a train, sailing in a ship, or flying in an aeroplane are deliberately designed to minimise the biomechanical effects on us. Not so with roller coaster rides. Roller coaster rides are deliberately designed to stimulate the human sensory system, primarily visual, auditory and vestibular. Users of amusement rides are purposely subjected to elevated acceleration where the magnitude, duration and rate of change of the acceleration are controlled. These biomechanical variables are increased to enhance the sensory stimulation but also limited to ensure ride safety [<a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#ejpaa4184bib3" id="fnref-ejpaa4184bib3">3</a>].</p><p>The biomechanical effects of elevated accelerations do not all lead to pleasure. If a roller coaster ride was inadequately designed or faulty the biomechanical effects would result in a feeling of discomfort or even harm to the health of the passengers.</p><p>The ability of the human body to handle extreme <em>g</em>-forces was experimentally validated in the late 1940s by Col. John Stapp of the US Air Force [<a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#ejpaa4184bib4" id="fnref-ejpaa4184bib4">4</a>, <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#ejpaa4184bib5" id="fnref-ejpaa4184bib5">5</a>]. Stapp planned and conducted a series of tests on himself using a rocket-powered sled, known as the 'Gee Whiz' or 'Sonic Wind'. He strapped himself into the sled facing rearward, refusing anaesthetic because he wanted to study his reactions first-hand. Travelling at speeds greater than 65 m s<sup>−1</sup> he was brought to an abrupt stop in less than 6 ms as he was crushed against the seat back. He is credited with proving that the human body can withstand elevated <em>g</em>-forces and survived a <span xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><span><span><img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=" data-src="https://content.cld.iop.org/journals/0143-0807/37/6/065008/revision1/ejpaa4184ieqn8.gif" alt="$46.2g$"></span></span></span> impact, although in the process he suffered headaches, concussion, a fractured rib and wrist, and a haemorrhaged retina [<a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#ejpaa4184bib3" id="fnref-ejpaa4184bib3">3</a>, <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#ejpaa4184bib5" id="fnref-ejpaa4184bib5">5</a>].</p><p>Figure <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#ejpaa4184f1">1</a> illustrates the coordinate system used to describe the forces acting on a passenger.

Note that the coordinate axes in table <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#ejpaa4184t1">1</a> are fixed to the person, as shown in figure <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#ejpaa4184f1">1</a>, and move and rotate together with the rider during a ride.</p><p>In most roller coasters, curves are banked to minimize lateral forces (<em>a</em><sub><em>y</em></sub>). As long as the position of the body is essentially with the 'vertical' (<em>z</em>) axis (spine) orthogonal to the track, forces in the <em>x</em> direction are relatively small, apart from during launches and brakes. In other types of rides or in roller coasters, where e.g. riders rotate relative to the track, it is of particular importance to account for the combinations of the acceleration vectors. The maximum allowable acceleration exposure in each direction, shown in table <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#ejpaa4184t1">1</a>, is then reduced by the combination, as indicated in the 'egg graphs' in figure <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#ejpaa4184f5">5</a>.

<div data-mobile-collapse=""><p>Consider the following statements: 'She jerked the phone out of his hands'; 'The bus jerked to a halt'; or 'The carriages jerked and jolted along as the train moved forward'. What do they tell us?</p><p>Driving in a car we can observe effects of velocity, acceleration and higher order derivatives. A more experienced driver accelerates smoothly, whereas a learner may produce a jerky ride. Changing gears with a manual clutch can cause the car to shudder along the road inducing both jerk and snap.</p><p>Jerk and snap can be observed in various areas of physics and engineering. In physics and engineering jerk and snap should always be considered when vibration occurs and particularly when this excitation induces multi-resonant modes of vibration. They should also be considered at all times when a transition occurs such as: start up and shutdown; take-off and landing; and accelerating and decelerating.</p><p>Acceleration without jerk is just a static load, and therefore constant acceleration alone could never cause vibration. In a machine shop, a toolmaker can damage the mill or the job if the setup starts vibrating. This vibration happens because of jerk and snap.</p><p>In mechanical engineering it is important in automotive design to ensure that the cam-follower does not jump off the camshaft. It is also important in manufacturing processes as rapid changes in acceleration of a cutting tool can lead to premature tool wear and result in an uneven and rough surface finish.</p><p>In civil engineering railway train tracks and roads should be designed for a smooth exit from a straight section into a curve, and it is common to use a transition called a clothoid, which is part of a Cornu spiral (also referred to as an Euler spiral). When a clothoid is implemented the change in acceleration is not abrupt and the levels of jerk and possibly snap are significantly reduced. If the transition between different radii of curvature is sudden, the transition is uncomfortable for passengers and potentially dangerous as it could cause the car or train to be thrown off the road or track. With good physics design engineers are attempting to produce a gradual jerk and constant snap, which gives a smooth increase in radial acceleration, or preferably a zero snap, constant jerk, and linear increase in radial acceleration. Just as road and railway engineers design out jerk and snap using the clothoid transition so, too, do roller coaster designers when they design loops and helices for the roller coasters [<a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#ejpaa4184bib11" id="fnref-ejpaa4184bib11">11</a>, <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#ejpaa4184bib12" id="fnref-ejpaa4184bib12">12</a>].</p><p>In greyhound racing the velocity can be more than 18 m s<sup>−1</sup> and the abrupt transition from the straight to a circular bend results in a greater frequency of accidents and injuries.</p></div>

As the acceleration passes zero, the jerk has its maximum value <span xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><span><span><img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=" data-src="https://content.cld.iop.org/journals/0143-0807/37/6/065008/revision1/ejpaa4184ieqn32.gif" alt="$(N-1)g\omega $"></span></span></span> as the gymnast is on the way down, and a maximum negative value <span xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><span><span><img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=" data-src="https://content.cld.iop.org/journals/0143-0807/37/6/065008/revision1/ejpaa4184ieqn33.gif" alt="$-(N-1)g\omega $"></span></span></span> when the gymnast is on the way up. There may be a very small lag due to the inherent damping within the trampoline system.</p><p>In the theoretical model, the jerk becomes a step function, in the moments when the feet reach or leave the mat. This leads to singularities in the higher derivatives. The derivative of the step function can formally be described by a Dirac delta function, which can be implemented using a number of different analytical functions. Each successive derivative of the delta function brings an additional maximum or minimum. The width and height of the approximate delta function and its derivatives depend on the implementation.</p></div><h3 id="ejpaa4184s5-2" name="ejpaa4184s5-2">5.2.&nbsp;Authentic trampoline data</h3><div><p>Figure <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#ejpaa4184f6">6</a> shows accelerometer data, together with its derivative, jerk, for five consecutive jumps on a gymnastic trampoline where force on the jumper reaches <span xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><span><span><img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=" data-src="https://content.cld.iop.org/journals/0143-0807/37/6/065008/revision1/ejpaa4184ieqn34.gif" alt="$9.1{mg}$"></span></span></span> (and the acceleration reaches <span xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><span><span><img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=" data-src="https://content.cld.iop.org/journals/0143-0807/37/6/065008/revision1/ejpaa4184ieqn35.gif" alt="$8.1g$"></span></span></span>).</p><figure xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="ejpaa4184f6" tabindex="-1" role="group" data-toolbar-type="figure" data-toolbar-link="ejpaa4184f6" data-toolbar-img="https://content.cld.iop.org/journals/0143-0807/37/6/065008/revision1/ejpaa4184f6_lr.jpg" data-toolbar-title="Figure 6."><figure><div><p><img alt="Figure 6." data-src="https://content.cld.iop.org/journals/0143-0807/37/6/065008/revision1/ejpaa4184f6_lr.jpg" src="https://content.cld.iop.org/journals/0143-0807/37/6/065008/revision1/ejpaa4184f6_lr.jpg"></p></div><figcaption><p><strong>Figure 6.</strong>&nbsp;Acceleration (blue, in units of <em>g</em>) and jerk (red, in <span><span><span><img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=" data-src="https://content.cld.iop.org/journals/0143-0807/37/6/065008/revision1/ejpaa4184ieqn36.gif" alt="$g/10$"></span></span></span> s) during five consecutive bounces on a gymnastic trampoline.

<div data-mobile-collapse=""><p>Roller coasters involve transitions between many different types of motion. If the radius of curvature in a transition changes abruptly, it also leads to a sudden change in acceleration—a jerk. As an example, we consider a hypothetical circular loop suddenly changing to a straight track, which would mean changing from (at least) <span xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><span><span><img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=" data-src="https://content.cld.iop.org/journals/0143-0807/37/6/065008/revision1/ejpaa4184ieqn48.gif" alt="$5g$"></span></span></span> to about <span xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><span><span><img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=" data-src="https://content.cld.iop.org/journals/0143-0807/37/6/065008/revision1/ejpaa4184ieqn49.gif" alt="$1g$"></span></span></span> at the bottom, in a very short time (and vice versa on the way into the loop). For a 20 m high loop, the speed would be at least 20 m s<sup>−1</sup> at the bottom. For distance between wheel axles which is typically around 1 m, this would give a change in vertical force of at least <span xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><span><span><img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=" data-src="https://content.cld.iop.org/journals/0143-0807/37/6/065008/revision1/ejpaa4184ieqn50.gif" alt="$4{mg}$"></span></span></span> in 0.05 s, corresponding jerk of about 80<em>g</em> s<sup>−1</sup>. In addition, there would be a sudden change in angular velocity, from <span xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><span><span><img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=" data-src="https://content.cld.iop.org/journals/0143-0807/37/6/065008/revision1/ejpaa4184ieqn51.gif" alt="$2\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1}$"></span></span></span> to 0, giving an angular acceleration <span xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><span><span><img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=" data-src="https://content.cld.iop.org/journals/0143-0807/37/6/065008/revision1/ejpaa4184ieqn52.gif" alt="$40\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-2}$"></span></span></span>. This combination was known to lead to whiplash injuries in the early 20th century roller coaster loop-the-loop coasters, e.g. at Coney Island [<a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#ejpaa4184bib10" id="fnref-ejpaa4184bib10">10</a>]. Roller-coaster designer Werner Stengel has described how the clothoid was introduced to avoid sudden changes of radius of curvature [<a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#ejpaa4184bib11" id="fnref-ejpaa4184bib11">11</a>]. Also other mathematical shapes are used where all derivatives are continuous [<a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#ejpaa4184bib11" id="fnref-ejpaa4184bib11">11</a>, <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="#ejpaa4184bib12" id="fnref-ejpaa4184bib12">12</a>].</p><p>Mechanical brakes in older roller coasters often lead to abrupt stops. In these cases, not only the rapid changes in force on the body contribute to a possibly uncomfortable experience, but also the uneven distributions of the forces over the torso of the rider. High jerk and snap within roller coasters also reduces the life of both the structure and cars. Also the gradients of the force on the body may be worth considering.</p></div>
<p>Jerk is a common everyday experience, but rarely mentioned in the teaching of mechanics. Still, minimising jerk is an important consideration from smooth driving of a car or bus to the design of roller coasters and other rides. The human tolerance to acceleration has been measured and is well understood. The human tolerance to jerk and snap is not well understood. Nevertheless, designers of roller coaster rides limit these to improve the passenger comfort of their rides. Roller coaster passengers need time to sense acceleration changes and adjust their muscle tension or suffer conditions such as whiplash. Even when human safety is not an issue physicists and engineers expend considerable design effort optimising jerk and eliminating snap within roller coaster rides to reduce maintenance and extend the life of the ride.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
								<p>Slack's engineering team recently published <a href="https://slack.engineering/balancing-old-tricks-with-new-feats-ai-powered-conversion-from-enzyme-to-react-testing-library-at-slack/" target="_blank">how it used a large language model (LLM) to automatically convert 15,000 unit and integration tests</a> from <a href="https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/" target="_blank">Enzyme</a> to <a href="https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/" target="_blank">React Testing Library (RTL)</a>. By combining Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) transformations and AI-powered automation, Slack's innovative approach resulted in an 80% conversion success rate, significantly reducing the manual effort required and showcasing the potential of AI in streamlining complex development tasks.</p>

<p>This transition was prompted by Enzyme's <a href="https://dev.to/wojtekmaj/enzyme-is-dead-now-what-ekl" target="_blank">lack of support for React 18</a>, necessitating a significant shift to maintain&nbsp;compatibility with the latest <a href="https://react.dev/" target="_blank">React</a> version. The conversion&nbsp;tool's adoption rate at Slack reached approximately 64%, saving considerable developer time of at least 22% of 10,000 hours. While this figure represents a significant saving, Sergii Gorbachov, senior software engineer at&nbsp;Slack, speculates that, in reality, the figure is probably much higher:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It's important to note that this 22% time saving represents only the documented cases where the test case passed. However, it's conceivable that some test cases were converted properly, yet issues such as setup or importing syntax may have caused the test file not to run at all, and time savings were not accounted for in those instances.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The team initially attempted to automate the conversion using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree" target="_blank">Abstract Syntax Tree</a> (AST) transformations, aiming for 100% accuracy. However, the complexity and variety of Enzyme methods led to a modest success rate of 45% in automatically converting code. One factor contributing to the low success rate is that correct conversion depends on contextual information regarding the rendered <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction" target="_blank">Document Object Model</a> (DOM) under test, to which the AST conversion has no access.</p>

<p><img alt="" data-src="news/2024/06/slack-automatic-test-conversion/en/resources/1Slack-AST-Representation-1717931855564.png" src="https://imgopt.infoq.com/fit-in/3000x4000/filters:quality(85)/filters:no_upscale()/news/2024/06/slack-automatic-test-conversion/en/resources/1Slack-AST-Representation-1717931855564.png" rel="share"><br>

<p>Next, the team attempted to perform the conversion using <a href="http://www.anthropic.com/">Anthropic</a>'s&nbsp;LLM, <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/claude" target="_blank">Claude</a> 2.1. Despite efforts to refine prompts, the conversion success rates varied significantly between 40% and 60%. Gorbachov notes that "the outcomes ranged from remarkably effective conversions to disappointingly inadequate ones, depending largely on the complexity of the task."</p>

<p>Following the unsatisfactory results, the team decided to observe how human developers approached converting the unit tests. They noticed that human developers had access to a broad knowledge base on React, Enzyme and RTL, and they combined that knowledge with access to context on the rendered React element and the AST conversions provided by the initial version of the conversion tool.</p>

<p>Slack's engineers then adopted a hybrid approach, combining the AST transformations with LLM capabilities and mimicking human behaviour. By feeding the rendered React component under test and the conversions performed by the AST tool into the LLM as part of the prompt and creating a robust control mechanism for the AI, they achieved an 80% conversion success rate, demonstrating the complementary nature of these technologies.</p>

<p>An Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) is a tree representation of the abstract syntactic structure of source code written in a programming language. Each node in the tree denotes a construct occurring in the source code. A syntax tree focuses on the structure and content necessary for understanding the code's functionality. ASTs are commonly used in compilers and interpreters to parse and analyze code, enabling various transformations, optimizations, and translations during compilation.</p>

		<blockquote><p><em>The history of every major galactic civilization tends to pass through three distinct and recognizable phases, those of Survival, Inquiry and Sophistication, otherwise known as the How, Why, and Where phases. For instance, the first phase is characterized by the question ‘How can we eat?’, the second by the question ‘Why do we eat?’ and the third by the question, ‘Where shall we have lunch?’</em> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Adams">Douglas Adams</a>, “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy">The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</a>“)</p></blockquote>
<p>One can roughly divide mathematical education into three stages:</p>
<ol>
<li>The “pre-rigorous” stage, in which mathematics is taught in an informal, intuitive manner, based on examples, fuzzy notions, and hand-waving. (For instance, calculus is usually first introduced in terms of slopes, areas, rates of change, and so forth.) The emphasis is more on computation than on theory. This stage generally lasts until the early undergraduate years.</li>
<li>The “rigorous” stage, in which one is now taught that in order to do maths “properly”, one needs to work and think in a much more precise and formal manner (e.g. re-doing calculus by using epsilons and deltas all over the place). The emphasis is now primarily on theory; and one is expected to be able to comfortably manipulate abstract mathematical objects without focusing too much on what such objects actually “mean”. This stage usually occupies the later undergraduate and early graduate years.</li>
<li>The “post-rigorous” stage, in which one has grown comfortable with all the rigorous foundations of one’s chosen field, and is now ready to revisit and refine one’s pre-rigorous intuition on the subject, but this time with the intuition solidly buttressed by rigorous theory. (For instance, in this stage one would be able to quickly and accurately perform computations in vector calculus by using analogies with scalar calculus, or informal and semi-rigorous use of infinitesimals, big-O notation, and so forth, and be able to convert all such calculations into a rigorous argument whenever required.) The emphasis is now on applications, intuition, and the “big picture”. This stage usually occupies the late graduate years and beyond.</li>
</ol>
<p>The transition from the first stage to the second is well known to be rather traumatic, with the dreaded “proof-type questions” being the bane of many a maths undergraduate. (See also “<a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/theres-more-to-mathematics-than-grades-and-exams-and-methods/">There’s more to maths than grades and exams and methods</a>“.) But the transition from the second to the third is equally important, and should not be forgotten.</p>
<p>It is of course vitally important that you know how to think rigorously, as this gives you the discipline to avoid many common errors and purge many misconceptions. Unfortunately, this has the unintended consequence that “fuzzier” or “intuitive” thinking (such as heuristic reasoning, judicious extrapolation from examples, or analogies with other contexts such as physics) gets deprecated as “non-rigorous”. All too often, one ends up discarding one’s initial intuition and is only able to process mathematics at a formal level, thus getting stalled at the second stage of one’s mathematical education. &nbsp;(Among other things, this can impact one’s ability to read mathematical papers; an overly literal mindset can lead to <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/advice-on-writing-papers/on-compilation-errors-in-mathematical-reading-and-how-to-resolve-them/">“compilation errors”</a> when one encounters even a single typo or ambiguity in such a paper.)</p>
<p>The point of rigour is <em>not</em> to destroy all intuition; instead, it should be used to destroy <em>bad</em> intuition while clarifying and elevating <em>good</em> intuition. It is only with a combination of both rigorous formalism and good intuition that one can tackle complex mathematical problems; one needs the former to correctly deal with the fine details, and the latter to correctly deal with the big picture. Without one or the other, you will spend a lot of time blundering around in the dark (which can be instructive, but is highly inefficient). So once you are fully comfortable with rigorous mathematical thinking, you should revisit your intuitions on the subject and use your new thinking skills to test and refine these intuitions rather than discard them. One way to do this is to <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/ask-yourself-dumb-questions-and-answer-them/">ask yourself dumb questions</a>; another is to <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/learn-and-relearn-your-field/">relearn your field</a>.</p>
<p>The ideal state to reach is when every heuristic argument naturally suggests its rigorous counterpart, and vice versa. Then you will be able to tackle maths problems by using both halves of your brain at once – i.e., the same way you already tackle problems in “real life”.</p>

</ul>
<p>Added later: It is perhaps worth noting that mathematicians at all three of the above stages of mathematical development can still make formal mistakes in their mathematical writing. &nbsp;However, the <em>nature</em> of these mistakes tends to be rather different, depending on what stage one is at:</p>
<ol>
<li>Mathematicians at the pre-rigorous stage of development often make formal errors because they are&nbsp;<em>unable</em> to understand how the rigorous mathematical formalism actually works, and are instead applying formal rules or heuristics blindly. &nbsp;It can often be quite difficult for such mathematicians to appreciate and correct these errors even when those errors are explicitly pointed out to them.</li>
<li>Mathematicians at the rigorous stage of development can still make formal errors because they have not yet perfected their formal understanding, or are unable to perform enough “sanity checks” against intuition or other rules of thumb to catch, say, a sign error, or a failure to correctly verify a crucial hypothesis in a tool. &nbsp;However, such errors can usually be detected (and often repaired) once they are pointed out to them.</li>
<li>Mathematicians at the post-rigorous stage of development are not infallible, and are still capable of making formal errors in their writing. &nbsp;But this is often because they <em>no longer need</em> the formalism in order to perform high-level mathematical reasoning, and are actually proceeding largely through intuition, which is then translated (possibly incorrectly) into formal mathematical language.</li>
</ol>
<p>The distinction between the three types of errors can lead to the phenomenon (which can often be quite puzzling to readers at earlier stages of mathematical development) of a mathematical argument by a post-rigorous mathematician which locally contains a number of typos and other formal errors, but is globally quite sound, with the local errors propagating for a while before being cancelled out by other local errors. &nbsp;(In contrast, when unchecked by a solid intuition, once an error is introduced in an argument by a pre-rigorous or rigorous mathematician, it is possible for the error to propagate out of control until one is left with complete nonsense at the end of the argument.) &nbsp;See <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/advice-on-writing-papers/on-local-and-global-errors-in-mathematical-papers-and-how-to-detect-them/">this post</a> for some further discussion of such errors, and how to read papers to compensate for them.</p>

<p>Every 60 seconds the equivalent of a lorry-load of plastic enters the global ocean. Where it goes after that remains largely unknown. But a new <a href="https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Preparing_for_the_Future/Discovery_and_Preparation">ESA Discovery</a> study reported in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48674-7">Nature Communications</a>&nbsp;has proven the concept of monitoring floating plastic litter using satellites.</p>

		<p>The quantity of plastic floating on the sea surface is rarely high enough to generate a detectable signal from space. Plastics and other floating debris have to accumulate into dense patches of at least tens of metres in area to be detectable using existing satellites.</p><p>These patches of floating litter are called ‘slicks’, ‘streaks’ or ‘litter windrows’. They are often filament-shaped, resulting from the presence of convergence current lines on the sea surface.</p><p>Detecting such litter windrows is indicative of high pollution at a particular place and time. But could such scattered and short-lived patches of litter provide sufficiently useful data for global monitoring of plastic pollution?</p>	</div>

		<p>“We didn’t know if the abundance of litter windrows was enough to draw maps, or to reveal trends over time,” notes Andrés Cózar, from the <a href="https://www.uca.es/?lang=en">University of Cádiz</a>, co-director of the project.</p><p>To find out ESA Discovery funded a consortium of space companies and research institutes from six countries. Using a six-year historical series of 300 000 satellite images, the team scanned the entire Mediterranean Sea every three days, at a spatial resolution of 10 metres, on the hunt for windrows.</p><p>They relied on the multispectral imaging <a href="https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Sentinel-2">Sentinel-2</a>&nbsp;satellites of Europe’s <a href="https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus">Copernicus programme</a>, which while not designed for litter detection, have a somewhat limited capability for plastic detection.</p>	</div>

		<p>“Searching for litter aggregations of metres in size on the ocean surface is like looking for needles in a haystack,” explains Manuel Arias, from the Institute of Marine Sciences, <a href="https://www.csic.es/en">CSIC</a>, in Spain, the other project co-director.</p><p>Automation was what made the project possible, harnessing supercomputers and advanced search algorithms. The team found thousands of litter windrows, most more than a kilometre long – and some reaching 20 km in length. The result was the most complete map of marine litter pollution to date.</p><p>“Litter detections with a non-specialised satellite allowed us to identify the most polluted areas and their major changes over weeks and years,” comments Andrés Cózar. “Litter is injected into the Mediterranean Sea as the rainstorms rage.”</p>	</div>

		<p>A key element of this work has been in understanding the significance of the litter windrow structures in the context of marine monitoring, being mainly associated with land-based litter emissions in the preceding days.</p><p>This makes them especially useful for surveillance and management of the problem. In the paper the team assess the effectiveness of action plans against marine litter around Rome, identify a pollution hotspot related to shipping through the Egypt’s Suez Canal and put forward satellite data for guiding cleanup operations in Spain’s Bay of Biscay.</p><p>Manuel Arias explains: “The tool is ready to be used in other world regions, which I am convinced will teach us much about the littering phenomenon, including identification of sources and the pathways to the ocean.”&nbsp;</p>	</div>

		<p>Andrés Cózar adds: “There is still room for improvement. The sensor used in our proof was not designed to detect plastic. Detection capability would be enormously improved if we put observation technology into orbit tailored for ocean plastics.”</p><p>The ability to monitor marine litter pollution in this way also holds broader promise. The deployment of a sensor specifically dedicated to detect and identify floating objects one metre in size could also be useful for tasks such as oil spill monitoring, loss of cargo or even search and rescue at sea.</p><p>Paolo Corradi, overseeing the project for ESA Discovery, comments: “The importance of these results and the applicability of this methodology can indeed be extended in a wider sense to the monitoring and characterisation of generic floating matter accumulations. This could be the more general target of a dedicated small satellite mission, which would collect the interest of a large scientific community, while addressing the need for large scale monitoring of marine litter pollution.”</p><p>“ESA Discovery is our funding programme to ensure our Agency is ready for tomorrow, looking into future ways we might make use of space,” comments Dietmar Pilz, ESA Director of Technology, Engineering and Quality. “The potential detection of marine plastic litter has been a topic of interest for a number of years within ESA Discovery. I am pleased to see this work has resulted in such a landmark scientific paper, exploiting the incredible value of the data from Europe’s Copernicus satellites.”</p>	</div>

<h2>The End of the Privacy of Digital Correspondence</h2>



<p>The EU Commission proposes to oblige providers to search all private chats, messages, and emails automatically for suspicious content – generally and indiscriminately. The stated aim: To prosecute child sexual exploitation material (CSEM). The result: Mass surveillance by means of fully automated real-time surveillance of messaging and chats and the end of privacy of digital correspondence. </p>



<p>Other aspects of the proposal include ineffective network blocking, screening of personal cloud storage including private photos, mandatory age verification resulting in the end of anonymous communication, appstore censorship and excluding minors from the digital world. </p>



<h2 id="chatcontrol20"><strong>Chat control 2.0 on every smartphone</strong></h2>



<p>On 11 May 2022<strong> <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/proposal-regulation-laying-down-rules-prevent-and-combat-child-sexual-abuse_en">the European Commission presented a proposal</a> which would make chat control searching <em>mandatory</em> for all e-mail and messenger providers</strong> and would even apply to so far securely end-to-end encrypted communication services. Prior to the proposal a public consultation had revealed that <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12726-Child-sexual-abuse-online-detection-removal-and-reporting-/public-consultation_en">a majority of respondents, both citizens and stakeholders, opposed imposing an obligation to use chat control.</a> Over 80% of respondents opposed its application to end-to-end encrypted communications.</p>



<p>Currently a <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/chatcontrol-european-parliament-approves-mass-surveillance-of-private-communications/">regulation</a> is in place <em>allowing</em> providers to scan communications voluntarily (so-called “Chat Control 1.0”). So far only some unencrypted US communications services such as GMail, Facebook/Instagram Messenger, Skype, Snapchat, iCloud email and X-Box apply chat control voluntarily (more details <a href="https://www.esafety.gov.au/sites/default/files/2022-12/BOSE%20transparency%20report%20Dec%202022.pdf">here</a>). As a result of the mandatory Chat Control 2.0 proposal, the Commission expects a 3.5-fold increase in scanning reports (by <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=SWD:2022:0209:FIN:EN:PDF">354%</a>).</p>



<p>Parliament has positioned itself almost unanimously against indiscriminate chat control. With supporters and opponents of mandatory chat control irreconcilably opposed in the EU Council and no common position in sight, the EU Commission <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/documents-register/detail?ref=COM(2023)777&amp;lang=en">proposed</a> a two-year extension of voluntary chat control 1.0 in November 2023 – see <a href="#timeline">timeline</a> and <a href="#documents-chatcontrol1">documents</a>. A victim of child sexual abuse and <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/meta-facebook-defends-error-prone-chat-control-csam-scanner-algorithms-in-court/">Pirate MEP Patrick Breyer have filed lawsuits</a> to stop the indiscriminate scanning by US big tech companies.</p>

<h3 id="epmandate">Changes proposed by the European Parliament</h3>



<p>In November 2023, the European Parliament nearly unanimously adopted a <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/CSAR_LIBE-Verhandlungsmandat.pdf">negotiating mandate</a> for the draft law. With the Pirate Party MEP Patrick Breyer, the most determined opponent of chat control sat at the negotiating table. The result: Parliament wants to pull the following fangs out of the EU Commission’s extreme draft:</p>



<ol>
<li>We want to safeguard the digital secrecy of correspondence and <strong>remove the plans for blanket chat control</strong>, which violate fundamental rights and stand no chance in court. The current voluntary chat control of private messages (not social networks) by US internet companies is being phased out. Targeted telecommunication surveillance and searches will only be permitted with a judicial warrant and only limited to persons or groups of persons suspected of being linked to child sexual abuse material.</li>



<li>We want to <strong>safeguard trust in secure end-to-end encryption</strong>. We clearly exclude so-called client-side scanning, i.e. the installation of surveillance functionalities and security vulnerabilities in our smartphones.</li>



<li>We want to <strong>guarantee the right to anonymous communication</strong> and remove mandatory age verification for users of communication services. Whistleblowers can thus continue to leak wrong-doings anonymously without having to show their identity card or face.</li>



<li><strong>Removing instead of blocking:</strong> Internet access blocking ist to be optional. Under no circumstances must legal content be collaterally blocked.</li>



<li>We prevent the digital house arrest: <strong>We don’t want to oblige app stores to prevent young people under 16 from installing messenger apps, social networking and gaming apps</strong> ‘for their own protection’ as proposed. The General Data Protection Regulation is maintained.</li>
</ol>



<p>Parliament wants to protect young people and victims of abuse much more effectively than the EU Commission’s extreme proposal:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Security by design:</strong> In order to protect young people from grooming, Parliament wants internet services and apps to be secure by design and default. It must be possible to block and report other users. Only at the request of the user should he or she be publicly addressable and see messages or pictures of other users. Users should be asked for confirmation before sending contact details or nude pictures. Potential perpetrators and victims should be warned where appropriate, for example if they try to search for abuse material using certain search words. Public chats at high risk of grooming are to be moderated.</li>



<li>In order to <strong>clean the net</strong> of child sexual abuse material, Parliament wants the new EU Child Protection Centre to proactively search publicly accessible internet content automatically for known CSAM. This crawling could also be used in the darknet and is thus more effective than private surveillance measures by providers.</li>



<li>Parliament wants to oblige providers who become aware of clearly illegal material to <strong>remove it</strong> – unlike in the EU Commission’s proposal. Law enforcement agencies who become aware of illegal material would be obliged to report it to the provider for removal. This is our reaction to the case of the darknet platform Boystown, where the worst abuse material was further disseminated for months with the knowledge of Europol.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Beware: This is only the Parliament’s negotiating mandate</strong>, which usually only partially prevails. Most EU governments continue to support the original chat control proposal of the EU Commission without significant compromises. However, many other governments prevent such a positioning (so-called blocking minority). As soon as the EU governments have reached an agreement in Council, Parliament, Council and Commission will start the so-called trilogue negotiations on the final version of the regulation. Patrick Breyer or his potential successor Anja Hirschel from the Pirate Party will again sit at the negotiating table to fight against chat control.</p>



<h2 id="councilpositions">Position of EU governments in Council</h2>



<p>Most EU governments continue to support the original extreme proposal of the EU Commission without making any significant improvements. Several other governments, however, prevent such a positioning (so-called blocking minority), so that proposed Council positions have already failed twice.</p>

<h3 id="timeline">The negotiations: A timeline</h3>



<p><strong>2020: The European Commission proposed “temporary” legislation allowing for chat control</strong></p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="538" src="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1600-840-max-d-1024x538.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1600-840-max-d-1024x538.png 1024w, https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1600-840-max-d-300x158.png 300w, https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1600-840-max-d-768x403.png 768w, https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1600-840-max-d-1536x806.png 1536w, https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1600-840-max-d-600x315.png 600w, https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1600-840-max-d.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<p>The <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/docs_autres_institutions/commission_europeenne/com/2020/0568/COM_COM(2020)0568_EN.pdf">proposed “temporary” legislation</a> allows the searching of all private chats, messages, and emails for illegal depictions of minors and attempted initiation of contacts with minors. This allows the providers of Facebook Messenger, Gmail, et al, to scan every message for suspicious text and images. This takes place in a fully automated process, in part using error-prone “artificial intelligence”. If an algorithm considers a message suspicious, its content and meta-data are disclosed (usually automatically and without human verification) to a private US-based organization and from there to national police authorities worldwide. The reported users are not notified.</p>



<p><strong>6 July 2021: The European Parliament <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/chatcontrol-european-parliament-approves-mass-surveillance-of-private-communications/" target="_blank">adopted the legislation allowing for chat control</a>.</strong></p>



<p>The European Parliament voted in favour for the ePrivacy Derogation, which allows for voluntary chat control for messaging and email providers. As a result of this some U.S. providers of services such as Gmail and Outlook.com are already performing such automated messaging and chat controls.</p>



<p><strong>9 May 2022: Member of the European Parliament Patrick Breyer has <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/destruction-of-digital-privacy-of-correspondence-lawsuit-filed-against-chat-control/">filed</a> a lawsuit against U.S. company Meta.</strong></p>



<p>According to the <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&amp;docid=232084&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=EN&amp;mode=req&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1">case-law of the European Court of Justice</a> the permanent and comprehensive automated analysis of private communications <strong>violates fundamental rights and is prohibited </strong>(paragraph 177). Former judge of the European Court of Justice Prof. Dr. Ninon Colneric has extensively analysed the plans and <strong>concludes in a <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Legal-Opinion-Screening-for-child-pornography-2021-03-04.pdf">legal assessment</a> that the EU legislative plans on chat control are not in line with the case law of the European Court of Justice and violate the fundamental rights of all EU citizens</strong> to respect for privacy, to data protection and to freedom of expression. On this basis the lawsuit was filed.</p>



<p><strong>11 Mai 2022: The Commission presented a proposal to make chat control mandatory for service providers.</strong></p>



<p>On 11 May 2022 the EU Commission made a second legislative proposal, in which <strong>the EU Commission obliges all providers of chat, messaging and e-mail services to deploy this mass surveillance technology in the absence of any suspicion. <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/poll-72-of-citizens-oppose-eu-plans-to-search-all-private-messages-for-allegedly-illegal-material-and-report-to-the-police/">However, a representative survey conducted in March 2021 clearly shows that a majority of Europeans oppose the use of chat control&nbsp;</a></strong><a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/poll-72-of-citizens-oppose-eu-plans-to-search-all-private-messages-for-allegedly-illegal-material-and-report-to-the-police/"> (</a><a href="https://nextcloud.pp-eu.eu/index.php/s/5bkdRGyxnAciNBz">Detailed poll results here)</a><strong><a href="https://nextcloud.pp-eu.eu/index.php/s/5bkdRGyxnAciNBz">.</a></strong></p>

<h2 id="how-does-this-affect-you">How does this affect you?</h2>



<p>Messaging and chat control scanning:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>All of your chat conversations and emails</strong> will be automatically searched for suspicious content. Nothing remains confidential or secret. There is no requirement of a court order or an initial suspicion for searching your messages. It occurs always and automatically.</li>



<li>If an algorithms classifies the content of a message as suspicious, <strong>your private or intimate photos</strong> may be viewed by staff and contractors of international corporations and police authorities. Also your private nude photos may be looked at by people not known to you, in whose hands your photos are not safe.</li>



<li><strong>Flirts and sexting may be read</strong> by staff and contractors of international corporations and police authorities, because text recognition filters looking for “child grooming” frequently falsely flag intimate chats.</li>



<li><strong>You can falsely be reported and investigated </strong>for allegedly disseminating child sexual exploitation material. Messaging and chat control algorithms are known to flag completely legal vacation photos of children on a beach, for example. According to Swiss federal police authorities, <a href="https://www.republik.ch/2022/12/08/die-dunklen-schatten-der-chatkontrolle">80%</a> of all machine-generated reports turn out to be without merit. Similarly in Ireland only <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/news/an-garda-siochana-unlawfully-retains-files-on-innocent-people-who-it-has-already-cleared-of-producing-or-sharing-of-child-sex-abuse-material/">20%</a> of NCMEC reports received in 2020 were confirmed as actual “child abuse material”. Nearly <a href="https://www.polizei-beratung.de/startseite-und-aktionen/aktuelles/detailansicht/polizeiliche-kriminalstatistik-2021/">40%</a> of all criminal investigation procedures initiated in Germany for “child pornography” target minors.</li>



<li>On your next <strong>trip overseas,</strong> you can expect big problems. Machine-generated reports on your communications may have been passed on to other countries, such as the USA, where there is no data privacy – with incalculable results.</li>



<li><strong>Intelligence services and hackers may be able to spy on your private chats and emails. </strong>The door will be open for anyone with the technical means to read your messages if secure encryption is removed in order to be able to screen messages.</li>



<li><strong>This is only the beginning</strong>. Once the technology for messaging and chat control has been established, it becomes very easy to use them for other purposes. And who guarantees that these incrimination machines will not be used in the future on our smart phones and laptops?</li>
</ul>



<p>Age verification:</p>



<ul>
<li>You can <strong>no longer set up anonymous e-mail or messenger accounts or chat anonymously</strong> without needing to present an ID or your face, making you identifiable and risking data leaks. This inhibits for instance sensitive chats related to sexuality, anonymous media communications with sources (e.g. whistleblowers) as well as political activity.</li>



<li><strong>If you are under 17, you will no longer be able to install the following apps from the app store</strong> (reason given: risk of grooming): Messenger apps such as Whatsapp, Snapchat, Telegram or Twitter, social media apps such as Instagram, TikTok or Facebook, games such as FIFA, Minecraft, GTA, Call of Duty, Roblox, dating apps, video conferencing apps such as Zoom, Skype, Facetime.</li>



<li>If you don’t use an appstore, compliance with the provider’s minimum age will still be verified and enforced. <strong>If you are under the minimum age of 16 years you can no longer use Whatsapp</strong> due to the proposed age verification requirements; the same applies to the online functions of the game FIFA 23. <strong>If you are under 13 years old you’ll no longer be able to use TikTok, Snapchat or Instagram.</strong></li>

<h2 id="WhatYouCanDo">What you can do</h2>



<p>Do you fear that this law would cause <strong>massive damage</strong> to fundamental rights and is the wrong approach?</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>What is important now is to <strong>increase pressure on the negotiators: </strong><br>Reach out to your government which is negotiating in Council. Contact your <a href="https://op.europa.eu/en/web/who-is-who/organization/-/organization/REPRES_PERM/REPRES_PERM">government’s permanent representation</a> or your Ministry of the interior. <br>Politely tell them your concerns about chat control (<a href="#AdditionalInformation" data-type="internal" data-id="#AdditionalInformation">arguments here</a>). Experience shows that phone calls are more effective than e-mails or letters. The official name of the planned mandatory chat control law is “Proposal for a Regulation laying down rules to prevent and combat child sexual abuse”.</td></tr><tr><td>Talk about it! Inform others about the dangers of chat control. <strong><a href="https://nextcloud.pp-eu.eu/index.php/s/cwyRic7cC5zcfHk">Here, you can find tweet templates, share pics and videos</a></strong>. Of course, you can also create your own images and videos.</td></tr><tr><td>Generate attention on social media! Use the hashtags <strong>#chatcontrol</strong> and <strong>#secrecyofcorrespondence</strong></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Generate media attention! </strong>So far very few media have covered the messaging and chat control plans of the EU. Get in touch with newspapers and ask them to cover the subject – online and offline.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ask your e-mail, messaging and chat service providers!</strong> Avoid Gmail, Facebook Messenger, outlook.com and the chat function of X-Box, where indiscriminate chat control is already taking place. Ask your email, messaging and chat providers if they generally monitor private messages for suspicious content, or if they plan to do so.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<h2 id="Myths">Debunking Myths</h2>



<p>When the draft law on chat control was first presented in May 2022, the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_22_2976" target="_blank">EU Commission promoted the controversial plan with various arguments.</a> In the following, various claims are questioned and debunked:</p>



<div data-initially-open="false" data-click-to-close="true" data-auto-close="true" data-scroll="false" data-scroll-offset="0"><h5 id="at-5999710" role="button"><strong>1. “Today, photos and videos depicting child sexual abuse are massively circulated on the Internet. In 2021, 29 million cases were reported to the U.S. National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children.”</strong></h5><p>To speak exclusively of depictions of child sexual abuse in the context of chat control is misleading. To be sure, child sexual exploitation material (CSEM) is often footage of sexual violence against minors (child sexual abuse material, CSAM). However, an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/TerminologyGuidelines_en.pdf" target="_blank">international working group of child protection institutions points out</a> that criminal material also includes recordings of sexual acts or of sexual organs of minors in which no violence is used or no other person is involved. Recordings made in everyday situations are also mentioned, such as a family picture of a girl in a bikini or naked in her mother’s boots. Recordings made or shared without the knowledge of the minor are also covered. Punishable CSEM also includes comics, drawings, manga/anime, and computer-generated depictions of fictional minors. Finally, criminal depictions also include self-made sexual recordings of minors, for example, for forwarding to partners of the same age (“sexting”). The study therefore proposes the term “depictions of sexual exploitation” of minors as a correct description. In this context, recordings of children (up to 14 years of age) and adolescents (up to 18 years of age) are equally punishable.</p></div>



<div data-initially-open="false" data-click-to-close="true" data-auto-close="true" data-scroll="false" data-scroll-offset="0"><h5 id="at-5999711" role="button"><strong>2. “In 2021 alone, 85 million images and videos of child sexual abuse were reported worldwide.”</strong></h5><div id="ac-5999711">
<p>There are many misleading claims circulating about how to quantify the extent of sexually exploitative images of minors (CSEM). The figure the EU Commission uses to defend its plans comes from the U.S. nongovernmental organization NCMEC (National Center for Missing and Exploited Children) and includes duplicates because CSEM is shared multiple times and often not deleted. Excluding duplicates, 22 million unique recordings remain of the 85 million reported.</p>



<p>75 percent of all NCMEC reports from 2021 came from Meta (FB, Instagram, Whatsapp). Facebook’s own internal analysis says that “more than 90 percent of [CSEM on Facebook in 2020] was identical or visually similar to previously reported content. And copies of just six videos were responsible for more than half of the child-exploitative content.” So the NCMEC’s much-cited numbers don’t really describe the extent of online recordings of sexual violence against children. Rather, they describe how often Facebook discovers copies of footage it already knows about. That, too, is relevant.</p>



<p>Not all unique recordings reported to NCMEC show violence against children. The 85 million depictions reported by NCMEC also include consensual sexting, for example. The number of depictions of abuse reported to NCMEC in 2021 was 1.4 million.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.missingkids.org/blog/2020/we-are-in-danger-of-losing-the-global-battle-for-child-safety" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">7% of NCMEC’s global SARs go to the European Union.</a></p>



<p>Moreover, even on Facebook, where chat control has long been used voluntarily, the numbers for the dissemination of abusive material continue to rise. Chat control is thus not a solution.</p>

The very configuration of the algorithms has a large impact on the number of SARs. Moreover, the increase shows that the circulation of CSEM cannot be controlled by means of chat control.</p></div>

To screen cloud storage, it is not necessary to mandate the monitoring of everyone’s communications. If you want to catch the perpetrators of online crimes related to child abuse material, you should use so-called honeypots and other methods that do not require monitoring the communications of the entire population.</p></div>

<h2 id="wrong-approach">Mass surveillance is the wrong approach to fighting “child pornography” and sexual exploitation</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Scanning private messages and chats does not contain the spread of CSEM.</strong> Facebook, for example, has been practicing chat control for years, and the number of automated reports has been increasing every year, most recently reaching 22 million in 2021. </li>



<li><strong>Mandatory chat control will not detect the perpetrators</strong> who record and share child sexual exploitation material. Abusers do not share their material via commercial email, messenger, or chat services, but organize themselves through self-run secret forums without control algorithms. Abusers also typically upload images and videos as encrypted archives and share only the links and passwords. Chat control algorithms do not recognize encrypted archives or links. </li>



<li><strong>The right approach would be to delete stored CSEM where it is hosted online.</strong> However, <a href="https://ipexl.europarl.europa.eu/IPEXL-WEB/download/file/082d2908811d46d301814771a13101cb">Europol does not report</a> known CSEM material. </li>



<li><strong>Chat control harms the prosecution of child abuse</strong> by flooding investigators will millions of automated reports, most of which are criminally irrelevant. </li>
</ul>



<h2 id="message-and-chat">Message and chat control harms everybody</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>All citizens are placed under suspicion, without cause, of possibly having committed a crime. </strong>Text and photo filters monitor all messages, without exception. <strong>No judge is required to order to such monitoring – contrary to the analog world which guarantees the privacy of correspondence and the confidentiality of written communications. </strong>According to a judgment by the European Court of Justice, the permanent and general automatic analysis of private communications violates fundamental rights (case C-511/18, Paragraph 192). Nevertheless, the EU now intends to adopt such legislation. For the court to annul it can take years. Therefore we need to prevent the adoption of the legislation in the first place.</li>



<li><strong>The confidentiality of private electronic correspondence is being sacrificed. </strong>Users of messenger, chat and e-mail services risk having their private messages read and analyzed. Sensitive photos and text content could be forwarded to unknown entities worldwide and can fall into the wrong hands. NSA staff have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/21/us/politics/edward-snowden-at-nsa-sexually-explicit-photos-often-shared.html?_r=0">reportedly</a> circulated nude photos of female and male citizens in the past. A Google engineer has been <a href="https://gawker.com/5637234/gcreep-google-engineer-stalked-teens-spied-on-chats">reported</a> to stalk minors.</li>



<li><strong>Indiscriminate messaging and chat control wrongfully incriminates hundreds of users every day.</strong> According the Swiss Federal Police, <a href="https://www.republik.ch/2022/12/08/die-dunklen-schatten-der-chatkontrolle">80%</a> of machine-reported content is not illegal, for example harmless holiday photos showing nude children playing at a beach. Similarly in Ireland only <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/news/an-garda-siochana-unlawfully-retains-files-on-innocent-people-who-it-has-already-cleared-of-producing-or-sharing-of-child-sex-abuse-material/">20%</a> of NCMEC reports received in 2020 were confirmed as actual “child abuse material”.</li>



<li><strong>Securely encrypted communication is at risk. </strong>Up to now, encrypted messages cannot be searched by the algorithms. To change that back doors would need to be built in to messaging software. As soon as that happens, this security loophole can be exploited by anyone with the technical means needed, for example by foreign intelligence services and criminals. Private communications, business secrets and sensitive government information would be exposed. Secure encryption is needed to protect minorities, LGBTQI people, democratic activists, journalists, etc.</li>



<li><strong>Criminal justice is being privatized. </strong>In the future the algorithms of corporations such as Facebook, Google, and Microsoft will decide which user is a suspect and which is not. The proposed legislation contains no transparency requirements for the algorithms used. Under the rule of law the investigation of criminal offences belongs in the hands of independent judges and civil servants under court supervision.</li>



<li><strong>Indiscriminate messaging and chat control creates a precedent and opens the floodgates to more intrusive technologies and legislation</strong>. Deploying technology for automatically monitoring all online communications is dangerous: It can very easily be used for other purposes in the future, for example copyright violations, drug abuse, or “harmful content”. In authoritarian states such technology is to identify and arrest government opponents and democracy activists. Once the technology is deployed comprehensively, there is no going back.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="why-messaging-and-chat-control-harms-children-and-abuse-victims"><strong>Messaging and chat control harms children and abuse victims</strong></h2>



<p>Proponents claim indiscriminate messaging and chat control facilitates the prosecution of child sexual exploitation. However, this argument is controversial, even among victims of child sexual abuse. In fact messaging and chat control can hurt victims and potential victims of sexual exploitation:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Safe spaces are destroyed. </strong>Victims of sexual violence are especially in need of the ability to communicate safely and confidentially to seek counseling and support, for example to safely exchange among each other, with their therapists or attorneys. The introduction of real-time monitoring takes these safe rooms away from them. This can discourage victims from seeking help and support.</li>



<li><strong>Self-recorded nude photos of minors (sexting) end up in the hands of company employees</strong> and police where they do not belong and are not safe.</li>



<li><strong>Minors are being criminalized. </strong>Especially young people often share intimate recordings with each other (sexting). With messaging and chat control in place, their photos and videos may end up in the hands of criminal investigators. German crime statistics demonstrate that nearly <a href="https://www.polizei-beratung.de/startseite-und-aktionen/aktuelles/detailansicht/polizeiliche-kriminalstatistik-2021/">40%</a> of all investigations for child pornography target minors.</li>



<li><strong>Indiscriminate messaging and chat control does not contain the circulation of illegal material but </strong><strong>actually makes it more difficult to prosecute child sexual exploitation. </strong>It encourages offenders to go underground and use private encrypted servers which can be impossible to detect and intercept. Even on open channels, indiscriminate messaging and chat control does not contain the volume of material circulated, as evidenced by the constantly rising number of machine reports.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h2>



<h3 id="Strengthening-the-capacity-of-law-enforcement"><strong>Strengthening the capacity of law enforcement</strong></h3>



<p>Currently, the capacity of law enforcement is so inadequate it often takes months and years to follow up on leads and analyse collected data. Known material is often neither analysed nor removed. Those behind the abuse do not share their material via Facebook or similar channels, but on the darknet. To track down perpetrators and producers, undercover police work must take place instead of wasting scarce capacities on checking often irrelevant machine reports. It is also essential to strengthen the responsible investigative units in terms of personnel and funding and financial resources, to ensure long-term, thorough and sustained investigations. Reliable standards/guidelines for the police handling of sexual abuse investgations need to be developed and adhered to.</p>



<h3 id="Addressing-not-only-symptoms"><strong>Addressing not only symptoms, but the root cause</strong></h3>



<p>Instead of ineffective technical attempts to contain the spread of exploitation material that has been released, all efforts must focus on preventing such recordings in the first place. Prevention concepts and training play a key role because the vast majority of abuse cases never even become known. Victim protection organisations often suffer from unstable funding.</p>



<h3 id="Fast-and-easily-available-support"><strong>Fast and easily available support for (potential) victims</strong></h3>



<ol>
<li><strong>Mandatory reporting mechanisms at online services: </strong>In order to achieve effective prevention of online abuse and especially grooming, online services should be required to prominently place reporting functions on the platforms. If the service is aimed at and/or used by young people or children, providers should also be required to inform them about the risks of online grooming. </li>



<li><strong>Hotlines and counseling centers:</strong> Many national hotlines dealing with cases of reported abuse are struggling with financial problems. It is essential to ensure there is sufficient capacity to follow up on reported cases.</li>
</ol>



<h3 id="Improving-media-literacy"><strong>Improving media literacy</strong></h3>



<p>Teaching digital literacy at an early age is an essential part of protecting for protecting children and young people online. The children themselves must have the knowledge and tools to navigate the Internet safely. They must be informed that dangers also lurk online and learn to recognise and question patterns of grooming. This could be achieved, for example, through targeted programs in schools and training centers, in which trained staff convey knowledge and lead discussions. Children need to learn to speak up, respond and report abuse, even if the abuse comes from within their sphere of trust (i.e., by people close to them or other people they know and trust), which is often the case. They also need to have access to safe, accessible, and age-appropriate channels to report abuse without fear.</p>

<p>“As with other types of content scanning (whether on platforms like YouTube or in private communications) scanning everything from everyone all the time creates huge risks of leading to mass surveillance by failing the necessity and proportionality test.

<blockquote>
<p>“In the course of the initiative “Fighting child sexual abuse: detection, removal, and reporting of illegal content”, the European Union plans to abolish the digital privacy of correspondence. In order to automatically detect illegal content, all private chat messages are to be screened in the future. This should also apply to content that has so far been protected with strong end-to-end encryption. If this initiative is implemented according to the current plan it would enormously damage our European ideals and the indisputable foundations of our democracy, namely freedom of expression and the protection of privacy […]. The initiative would also severely harm Europe’s strategic autonomy and thus EU-based companies.</p>

</ul>



<blockquote>
<p>Experts from the police and academia are rather critical of the EU’s plan: on the one hand, they fear many false reports by the scanners, and on the other hand, an alibi function of the law. Daniel Kretzschmar, spokesman for the Federal Board of the Association of German Criminal Investigators, says that the fight against child abuse depictions is “enormously important” to his association. Nevertheless, he is skeptical: unsuspected persons could easily become the focus of investigations. At the same time, he says, privatizing these initiative investigations means “making law enforcement dependent on these companies, which is actually a state and sovereign task. “</p>



<p>Thomas-Gabriel Rüdiger, head of the Institute for Cybercriminology at the Brandenburg Police University, is also rather critical of the EU project. “In the end, it will probably mainly hit minors again,” he told WELT. Rüdiger refers to figures from the crime statistics, according to which 43 percent of the recorded crimes in the area of child pornographic content would be traced back to children and adolescents themselves. This is the case, for example, with so-called “sexting” and “schoolyard pornography “, when 13- and 14-year-olds send each other lewd pictures.</p>



<p>Real perpetrators, who you actually want to catch, would probably rather not be caught. “They are aware of what they have done and use alternatives. Presumably, USB sticks and other data carriers will then be increasingly used again,” Rüdiger continues.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://exectos.eu.org/">https://exectos.eu.org/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40725451">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			       <h2 id="about">About</h2>
<p>ExectOS aims to be a stable and flexible, general purpose operating system written from scratch. It is designed to be
modular, maintainable and compatible with existing software. It implements a brand new XT architecture and features own
native application interface. On the backend, it contains a powerful driver model between device drivers and the kernel,
that enables kernel level components to be upgraded without a need to recompile all drivers.</p>
<h2 id="xt-architecture">XT Architecture</h2>
<p>ExectOS is a preemptive, reentrant multitasking operating system that implements the XT architecture which derives from
NT™ architecture. It is modular, and consists of two main layers: microkernel and user modes. Its’ kernel mode has
full access to the hardware and system resources and runs code in a protected memory area. It consists of executive
services, which is itself made up on many modules that do specific tasks, a kernel and drivers. Unlike the NT™, system
does not feature a separate Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) between the physical hardware and the rest of the OS. Instead,
XT architecture integrates a hardware specific code with the kernel. The user mode is made up of subsystems and it has been
designed to run applications written for many different types of operating systems. This allows us to implement any
environment subsystem to support applications that are strictly written to the corresponding standard (eg. DOS, or POSIX).
Thanks to that ExectOS will allow to run existing software, including Win32 applications.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Completely free, Open Source and community-driven modern Operating System.</li>
<li>Native multiple architecture support. It runs on x86 and x86_64 and is portable to other architectures.</li>
<li>Hardware layer API allows for a single unified kernel. There is no need to maintain a separate kernel forks.</li>
<li>Uses a couple of ideas from other open source projects, but it’s our own ideas that really sets us apart and defines
ExectOS. The majority of code is original, not forked.</li>
<li>Modular design for better compatibility with existing software and drivers, enabling binaries to remain compatible even
when the core system is updated.</li>
<li>Own, XT drivers for commonly used devices as well as NT™ drivers compatibility layer for better hardware support.</li>
<li>Technical support directly from the architects and developers of the system.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why">Why</h2>
<ul>
<li>We believe, there is no ideal Operating System on the market. During ExectOS development, we try to bring most useful
features known from existing solutions, while keeping compatibility with NT™ architecture at desired level.</li>
<li>Some of our ideas differ greatly from other projects and it is much easier if we do not have to fight legacy code and
ideas.</li>
<li>We need the freedom to break things when necessary.</li>
