<p><strong>OpenCiv3</strong> (formerly known by the codename “C7”) is an open-source, cross-platform, mod-oriented, modernized reimagining of <em>Civilization III</em> by the fan community built with the Godot Engine and C#, with capabilities inspired by the best of the 4X genre and lessons learned from modding Civ3. Our vision is to make Civ3 as it could have been, rebuilt for today’s modders and players: removing arbitary limits, fixing broken features, expanding mod capabilities, and supporting modern graphics and platforms. A game that can go beyond C3C but retain all of its gameplay and content.</p>

<p><strong><em>OpenCiv3 is under active development and currently in an early pre-alpha state.</em></strong> It is a rudimentary playable game but lacking many mechanics and late-game content, and errors are likely. Keep up with our development for the latest updates and opportunities to contribute!</p>

<h2 id="get-openciv3-dutch">Get OpenCiv3 “Dutch”</h2>

<h2 id="december-2025-v03-dutch-preview-1-has-been-released">December 2025: v0.3 Dutch Preview 1 Has Been Released!</h2>

<p>The OpenCiv3 team is pleased to announce the first preview release of the v0.3 “Dutch” milestone.  This is a major enhancement over the “Carthage” release, and our debut with standalone mode featuring placeholder graphics without the need for Civ3 media files. A local installation of Civ3 is still recommended for a more polished experience. See the <a href="https://github.com/C7-Game/Prototype/releases/">release notes</a> for a full list of new features in each version.</p>

<p><img src="https://openciv3.org/Dutch_standalone.png" alt="OpenCiv3 Dutch standalone mode" width="576" height="384"> 
<img src="https://openciv3.org/Dutch_imported.png" alt="OpenCiv3 Dutch Civ3 mode" width="576" height="384"></p>

<p><em>OpenCiv3 Dutch Preview 1 with the same game in Standalone mode (top) and with imported Civ3 graphics (bottom)</em></p>

<h2 id="download">Download</h2>

<p>Download the appropriate zip file for your OS from <strong><a href="https://github.com/C7-Game/Prototype/releases/tag/v0.3-dutch-preview-1">the Dutch Preview 1 release</a></strong></p>

<p>All official releases of OpenCiv3 along with more detailed release notes can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/C7-Game/Prototype/releases/">GitHub releases page.</a></p>

<h2 id="install">Install</h2>

<h3 id="system-requirements">System Requirements</h3>

<ul>
  <li>64-bit Windows, Linux, or Mac OS. Other platforms may be supported in future releases.</li>
  <li>Minimum hardware requirements have not yet been identified. Please let us know if OpenCiv3 does not perform well on your system.</li>
  <li>Recommended: A local copy of <em>Civilization III</em> files (the game itself does NOT have to run) from <em>Conquests</em> or the <em>Complete</em> edition. Standalone mode is available with placeholder graphics for those who do not have a copy.
    <ul>
      <li><em>Civilization III Complete</em> is available for a pittance from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3910/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_III_Complete/">Steam</a> or <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/sid_meiers_civilization_iii_complete">GOG</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="windows-installation">Windows Installation</h3>

<p>This is a Windows 64-bit executable. OpenCiv3 will look for a local installation of <em>Civilization III</em> in the Windows registry automatically, or you may use an environment variable to point to the files.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Download and extract the zip file</li>
  <li>Double-click <code>OpenCiv3.exe</code></li>
  <li>If it is blocked, you may need to unblock it by
    <ul>
      <li>Right click</li>
      <li>Click on Properties</li>
      <li>Check the “Unblock” checkbox near the bottom buttons in the “Security” section</li>
      <li>Click OK</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If your <em>Civilization III</em> installation is not detected, you can set the environment variable <code>CIV3_HOME</code> pointing to it and restart OpenCiv3</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="linux-installation">Linux Installation</h3>

<p>This is an x86-64 Linux executable. You may use an environment variable to point to the files from a <em>Civilization III</em> installation. You can just copy or mount the top-level “Sid Meier’s Civilization III Complete” (Sans “Complete” if your install was from pre-Complete CDs) folder and its contents to your Linux system, or install the game via Steam or GOG.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Download and extract the tgz file</li>
  <li>Set the <code>CIV3_HOME</code> environment variable to point to the Civ3 files, e.g. <code>export CIV3_HOME="/path/to/civ3"</code></li>
  <li>From that same terminal where you set <code>CIV3_HOME</code>, run <code>OpenCiv3.x86_64</code></li>
  <li>To make this variable permanent, add it to your <code>.profile</code> or equivalent.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="mac-installation">Mac Installation</h3>

<p>This is a universal 64-bit executable, so it should run on both Intel and M1 Macs. You may use an environment variable to point to the files from a <em>Civilization III</em> installation. You can just copy or mount the top-level “Sid Meier’s Civilization III Complete” (Sans “Complete” if your install was from pre-Complete CDs) folder and its contents to your Mac system, or install the game via Steam or GOG.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Download the zip; it may complain bitterly, and you may have to tell it to keep the download instead of trashing it</li>
  <li>Double click the zip file, and a folder with <code>OpenCiv3.app</code> and a json file will appear</li>
  <li>If you try to open <code>OpenCiv3.app</code> it will tell you it’s damaged and try to trash it; it is not damaged</li>
  <li>To unblock the downloaded app, from a terminal run <code>xattr -cr /path/to/OpenCiv3.app</code>; you can avoid typing the path out by typing <code>xattr -cr </code> and then dragging the <code>OpenCiv3.app</code> icon onto the terminal window</li>
  <li>Set the <code>CIV3_HOME</code> environment variable to point to the Civ3 files, e.g. <code>export CIV3_HOME="/path/to/civ3"</code></li>
  <li>From that same terminal where you set <code>CIV3_HOME</code>, run <code>OpenCiv3.app</code> with <code>open /path/to/OpenCiv3.app</code>, or again just type <code>open </code> and drag the OpenCiv3 icon onto the terminal window and press enter</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="known-issues">Known issues</h2>

<ul>
  <li>OpenCiv3 uses many primitive placeholder assets; loading files from a local <em>Civilization III</em> install is recommended (see platform specific setup instructions above)</li>
  <li>Support for playing Civ3 BIQ or SAV files is incomplete; some files will not load correctly and crashes may occur</li>
  <li>For Mac:
    <ul>
      <li>Mac will try hard not to let you run this; it will tell you the app is damaged and can’t be opened and helpfully offer to trash it for you. From a terminal you can <code>xattr -cr /path/to/OpenCiv3.app</code> to enable running it.</li>
      <li>Mac will crash if you hit buttons to start a new game (New Game, Quick Start, Tutorial, or Load Scenario) because it cant find our ‘new game’ save file we’re using as a stand-in for map generation. But you can Load Game and load <code>c7-static-map-save.json</code> or open a Civ3 SAV file to open that map</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Other specific bugs will be tracked on the <a href="https://github.com/C7-Game/Prototype/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Abug">GitHub issues page.</a></li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><h2 id="1-establish-a-clear-vision"><a href="#1-establish-a-clear-vision">1 Establish a Clear Vision</a></h2><p>You are a human, you know how this world behaves, how your team and colleagues behave, and what your users expect. You have experienced the world, and you want to work together with a system that has no experience in this world you live in. Every decision in your project that you don’t take and document will be taken for you by the AI.</p><p>Your responsibility of delivering quality code cannot be met if not even you know where long-lasting and difficult-to-change decisions are taken.<br>You must know what parts of your code need to be thought through and what must be vigorously tested.</p><p>Think about and discuss the architecture, interfaces, data structures, and algorithms you want to use.
Think about how to test and validate your code to these specifications.</p><h2 id="2-maintain-precise-documentation"><a href="#2-maintain-precise-documentation">2 Maintain Precise documentation</a></h2><p>You need to communicate to the AI in detail what you want to achieve, otherwise it will result in code that is unusable for your purpose.</p><p>Other developers also need to communicate this information to the AI. That makes it efficient to write as much documentation as practical in a standardized format and into the code repository itself.</p><p>Document the requirements, specifications, constraints, and architecture of your project in detail.<br>Document your coding standards, best practices, and design patterns.<br>Use flowcharts, UML diagrams, and other visual aids to communicate complex structures and workflows.<br>Write pseudocode for complex algorithms and logic to guide the AI in understanding your intentions.</p><h2 id="3-build-debug-systems-that-aid-the-ai"><a href="#3-build-debug-systems-that-aid-the-ai">3 Build debug systems that aid the AI</a></h2><p>Develop efficient debug systems for the AI to use, reducing the need for multiple expensive CLI commands or browsers to verify code functionality. This will save time and resources while simplifying the process for the AI to identify and resolve code issues.</p><p>For example: Build a system that collects logs from all nodes in a distributed system and provides abstracted information like “The Data was send to all nodes”, “The Data X is saved on Node 1 but not on Node 2”.</p><h2 id="4-mark-code-review-levels"><a href="#4-mark-code-review-levels">4 Mark code review levels</a></h2><p>Not all code is equally important. Some parts of your codebase are critical and need to be reviewed with extra care. Other parts are less important and can be generated with less oversight.</p><p>Use a system that allows you to mark how thoroughly each function has been reviewed.</p><p>For example you can use a prompt that will let the AI put the comment <code>//A</code> behind functions it wrote to indicate that the function has been written by an AI and is not yet reviewed by a human.</p><h2 id="5-write-high-level-specifications-and-test-by-yourself"><a href="#5-write-high-level-specifications-and-test-by-yourself">5 Write high level specifications and test by yourself</a></h2><p>AIs will cheat and use shortcuts eventually. They will write mocks, stubs, and hard coded values to make the code tests succeed while the code itself is not working and most of the time dangerous. Often AIs will adapt or outright delete test code to let the code pass tests.</p><p>You must discourage this behavior by writing property based high level specification tests yourself. Build them in a way that makes it hard for the AI to cheat without having big code segments dedicated to it.<br>For example, use property based testing, restart the server and check in between if the database has the correct values.</p><p>Separate these test so the AI cannot edit them and prompt the AI not to change them.</p><h2 id="6-write-interface-tests-in-a-separate-context"><a href="#6-write-interface-tests-in-a-separate-context">6 Write interface tests in a separate context</a></h2><p>Let an AI write property based interface tests for the expected behavior with as little context of the rest of the code as possible.<br>This will generate tests that are uninfluenced by the “implementation AI” which will prevent the tests from being adapted to the implementation in a way that makes them useless or less effective.</p><p>Separate these tests so the AI cannot edit them without approval and prompt the AI not to change them.</p><h2 id="7-use-strict-linting-and-formatting-rules"><a href="#7-use-strict-linting-and-formatting-rules">7 Use strict linting and formatting rules</a></h2><p>Use strict linting and formatting rules to ensure code quality and consistency. This will help you and your AI to find issues early.</p><h2 id="8-use-context-specific-coding-agent-prompts"><a href="#8-use-context-specific-coding-agent-prompts">8 Use context specific coding agent prompts</a></h2><p>Save time and money by utilizing path specific coding agent prompts like <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices#:~:text=Create%20CLAUDE.md%20files">CLAUDE.md</a>.</p><p>You can generate them automatically which will give your AI information it would otherwise as to create from scratch every time.</p><p>Try to provide as much high level information as practical, such as coding standards, best practices, design patterns, and specific requirements for the project. This will help the AI to generate code that is more aligned with your expectations and will reduce lookup time and cost.</p><h2 id="9-find-and-mark-functions-that-have-a-high-security-risk"><a href="#9-find-and-mark-functions-that-have-a-high-security-risk">9 Find and mark functions that have a high security risk</a></h2><p>Identify and mark functions that have a high security risk, such as authentication, authorization, and data handling. These functions should be reviewed and tested with extra care and in such a way that a human has comprehended the logic of the function in all its dimensions and is confident about its correctness and safety.</p><p>Make this explicit with a comment like <code>//HIGH-RISK-UNREVIEWED</code> and <code>//HIGH-RISK-REVIEWED</code> to make sure that other developers are aware of the importance of these functions and will review them with extra care.</p><p>Make sure that the AI is instructed to change the review state of these functions as soon as it changes a single character in the function.<br>Developers must make sure that the status of these functions is always correct.</p><h2 id="10-reduce-code-complexity-where-possible"><a href="#10-reduce-code-complexity-where-possible">10 Reduce code complexity where possible</a></h2><p>Aim to reduce the complexity of the generated code where possible. Each single line of code will eat up your context window and make it harder for the AI and You to keep track of the overall logic of your code.<br>Each avoidable line of code is costing energy, money and probability of future unsuccessful AI tasks.</p><h2 id="11-explore-problems-with-experiments-and-prototypes"><a href="#11-explore-problems-with-experiments-and-prototypes">11 Explore problems with experiments and prototypes</a></h2><p>AI written code is cheap, use this to your advantage by exploring different solutions to a problem with experiments and prototypes with minimal specifications.

Instead of asking the AI to generate the complete project or component at once, break it down into smaller tasks, such as generating individual functions or classes. This will help you to maintain control over the code and it’s logic.</p><p>You have to check each component or module for its adherence to the specifications and requirements.<br>If you have lost the overview of the complexity and inner workings of the code, you have lost control over your code and must restart from a state where you were in control of your code.</p></article></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>There was recently an attempt by an independent journalist to expose fraud in a Minnesota social program. It was deeply frustrating; the journalist had notably poor epistemic standards, which secondary media <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/12/31/nx-s1-5662600/nick-shirley-minnesota-daycare-fraud">seized upon</a> to dismiss their result.</p><p>The class-based sniffing almost invariably noted that prestige media had already <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/29/us/fraud-minnesota-somali.html">reported</a> stories which rhymed with the core allegation, while sometimes implying that makes the allegations less likely to be true, through a logical pathway which is mysterious to me.</p><p>The journalism went quite viral anyway, in part because of sensationalized framing, in part because of signal boosting by an aligned media ecosystem and aligned politicians, and in part because the journalism develops one bit of evidence that has a viscerality that paperwork dives often lack: these purported childcare operations routinely <em>have no children in them</em>.</p><p>Fraud has become quite politicized in the United States the last few years. We had a poorly-calibrated federal initiative led by a charismatic tech entrepreneur which believed it would unearth trillions of dollars of fraud that focused substantial effort on large programs which are comparatively fraud-resistant. Across the aisle, we have reflexive dismissal that fraud happens in social programs, which functions as air cover for <a href="https://www.startribune.com/federal-prosecutors-charge-six-more-people-in-staggering-social-services-fraud-scandal/601548801">scaled criminal operations</a> which loot many <a href="https://medium.com/@marginaliant/a-third-of-my-online-college-students-are-ai-powered-spambots-now-what-91c6e34b5d11">varied social programs</a> [0] and are sometimes <a href="https://www.sba.gov/document/report-22-17-covid-19-economic-injury-disaster-loan-applications-submitted-foreign-ip-addresses">run out of geopolitical adversaries</a> of the U.S. including by <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fraud-us-government-theft-60-minutes/">ambiguously-retired members of their clandestine services</a>.</p><p>I worked in the financial industry for a few years. We do not have the luxury of pretending that fraud is something invented by our rivals to besmirch our good name. It hits the P&amp;L every quarter and will eat you alive if you’re not at least minimally competent in dealing with it. Conversely, it is well-understood in industry that the <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/optimal-amount-of-fraud/">optimal amount of fraud is not zero</a>.</p><p>The financial industry has paid at least tens of billions of dollars in tuition here. Overwhelmingly, one learns about fraud in it through an apprenticeship model, with different firms having different internal levels of understanding on the shape of the elephant. The industrial organization presumes small numbers of people architecting anti-fraud systems and relatively larger numbers of investigators and analysts operating those systems on a day-to-day basis.</p><p>There does exist some informal knowledge sharing between firms. If you work in payments, try getting invited to the Chatham House rule sessions held by… oh yeah, can’t say. Despite that social technology being originally developed for the benefit of government and press actors, it is my general impression that U.S. benefits programs don’t yet see themselves as sufficiently yoked by adversarial attention to benefit from their own Chatham House series. Perhaps that should change.</p><p>And so, for the benefit of fraud investigators with badges, press cards, or GoPros, some observations from a community of practice with an extensive (and mostly nonpublic) body of work. But first a tiny bit of throat clearing.</p><h2 id="in-which-we-briefly-return-to-minnesota">In which we briefly return to Minnesota</h2><p>Minnesota has suffered a decade-long campaign of industrial-scale fraud against several social programs. This is beyond intellectually serious dispute. The <a href="https://www.auditor.leg.state.mn.us/sreview/ccap.pdf"><em>2019</em> report from the Office of the Legislative Auditor</a> (a non-partisan government body) makes for gripping reading. The scale of fraud documented and separately alleged in it staggers the imagination: the state’s own investigators believed that, over the past several years, <em>greater than fifty percent of all reimbursements to daycare centers</em> were fraudulent. (Separate officials took the… novel position that they were only required to recognize fraud had happened after securing a criminal conviction for it. Since they had only secured a few criminal convictions, there was <em>no way</em> that fraud was that high. Asked to put a number on it, repeatedly, they declined.)</p><p>The investigators allege repeatedly visiting daycare centers which did not, factually, have children physically present at the facility despite reimbursement paperwork identifying specific children being present at that specific time. The investigators demonstrated these lies on timestamped video, and perhaps in another life would have been YouTube stars.</p><p>Our social class is intensely averse to straightforwardly recounting these facts, partly due to political valence and partly due to this particular fraud being dominantly conducted within a community which codes as disadvantaged in the U.S. sociopolitical context.</p><p>Fraudsters are liars and will cheerfully mouth any words they believe will absolve them of their crimes. If an accusation of racism gets one a free pass to steal hundreds of millions of dollars, they will <a href="https://media.kalzumeus.com/bam/fraud-investigator/pacer-feeding-our-future.pdf">speciously sue you alleging racial discrimination</a>. That empirically <em>worked</em> in Minnesota. The OLA takes explicit notice of this multiple times, a coordinator for the fraud operation is <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/aimee-bock-minnesota-fraud-feeding-our-future-interview/">on record explicitly explaining the strategic logic of accusations of racism</a>, and a judge was even moved to make <a href="https://mncourts.gov/about-the-courts/newsandannouncements/feeding-our-future-v-minnesota-department-of-education-correcting-media-reports-and-statements-by-governor-tim-walz-concerning-orders-issued-by-the-court">an extraordinary statement</a> to clarify that the bad-faith lawsuit alleging racism did not achieve success<em> through the formal judicial process</em> but rather through the voluntary compliance of governmental actors shamed by its allegations.</p><p>(As a sidenote: one has to be able to hold two thoughts simultaneously about fraudulent operations. They can be sophisticated with respect to exploiting sociopolitical cleavages in their targets while also being comically inept at faking evidence elsewhere, such as having a single person write dozens of adjacent rows in a sign-in sheet. This routinely surprises observers and <em>it should not surprise them</em>. The financial industry <em>also</em> has a division of labor in it. The person architecting the fraud department’s standard processes is well-paid, well-educated, and routinely brings crossdisciplinary expertise to bear. A Fraud Analyst I, on the other hand, bears a lot of similarity to a call center employee in terms of compensation, education, and permitted amounts of agency.)</p><p>In the immediate wake of the independent journalist’s report, the great and the good rallied around the organizations he accused. Of course it was natural that journalists wouldn’t get immediate access to children if they asked. Of course there was a certain amount of informality in the sector. Of course, as the New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/us/nick-shirley-san-diego.html">very carefully wordsmithed recently</a>:</p><p><em>Minnesota officials said in early January that the state conducted compliance checks at nine child-care centers after Mr. Shirley posted his video and found them “operating as expected,” although it had “ongoing investigations” at four of them. One of the centers, which Mr. Shirley singled out because it misspelled the word “Learning” on its sign, has since voluntarily closed.</em></p><p>An inattentive reader might conclude from this paragraph that the Times disputes Shirley’s reporting.</p><p>To the extent that Bits about Money has an editorial line on that controversy, it is this: if you fish in a pond known to have 50% blue fish, and pull out nine fish, you will appear to be a savant-like catcher of blue fish, and people claiming that it is unlikely you have identified a blue fish will swiftly be made to look like fools. But the interesting bit of the observation is, almost entirely, the base rate of the pond. And I think journalism and civil society should do some genuine soul-searching on how we knew—<em>knew</em>—the state of that pond, but didn’t consider it particularly <em>important</em> or <em>newsworthy</em> until someone started fishing on camera.</p><p>But this is not a publication about particular ponds. It is a publication about getting better at fishing.</p><h2 id="common-signals-methods-and-epiphenomena-of-fraud">Common signals, methods, and epiphenomena of fraud</h2><h3 id="fraudsters-are-playing-an-iterated-game">Fraudsters are playing an iterated game</h3><p>The best non-fiction work on fraud is Dan Davies’ <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lying-Money-Legendary-Frauds-Working/dp/1982114932">Lying for Money</a>. In it, you’ll find replete examples of something well-known to fraud investigators: the dominant next adventure for a former fraudster is… opening up a new fraud. And therefore, if you want to identify a ridiculously-high-hit-rate list of frauds in round N+1 of a game, a so-easy-its-practically-cheating way to do so is to look at what known fraudsters from round N are doing today.</p><p>There is a genuine difference in the culture and epistemology of the financial industry versus the government of the United States here. In the financial industry, we keep <a href="https://developer.mastercard.com/product/match/">blacklists</a> and getting a second chance after obvious misbehavior is intentionally non-trivial. This runs against deeply felt values of civil servants. An accusation is not a conviction, and absent clear authority to impose consequences in a new program, an actor <em>convicted at enormous societal cost</em> emerges to a new program officer as tabula rasa, equal in moral worth to any randomly chosen citizen.</p><p>I will not argue that Mastercard has better moral intuitions than the Founding Fathers. I would, however, happily suggest that the government not assume that the Constitution contains emanating penumbras obligating it to be repeatedly taken advantage of by the same people in the same fashion.

That operation was owned by one Fowsiya Hassan. A separate childcare center owned by Fowsiya Hassan was featured on YouTube recently. This follows on<a href="http://startribune.com/day-care-fraud-minnesota-video/601554760"> $1.5 million of funds received through Feeding Our Future</a>, a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-mn/pr/federal-jury-finds-feeding-our-future-mastermind-and-co-defendant-guilty-250-million">scaled fraud operation</a> which has generated over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feeding_Our_Future">70 indictments, 5 criminal convictions, and 50 guilty pleas</a>. What a set of coincidences. Perhaps Hassan has, as she has <a href="https://media.kalzumeus.com/bam/fraud-investigator/hassan-complaint-vs-walz.pdf">alleged in a lawsuit</a>, been a frequent target of racially-motivated government investigations into a successful serial entrepreneur in the childcare field.</p><h3 id="the-fraud-supply-chain-is-detectable">The fraud supply chain is detectable</h3><p>Much of the intellectual energy in policy circles about fraud is aimed at retail-level fraud by individual beneficiaries. Most fraud, like most scaled property crime, is actually the result of a business process.</p><p>This is an elementary fact of capitalism. It is deeply disconcerting to find every benefits program independently rediscovers it a decade too late to do anything about it. Most bread is not baked by amateurs in their kitchens. It comes from <em>a bakery </em>which <em>exists to bake bread </em>and hires <em>specialists in baking bread</em> and then supports them with <em>capital-intensive built infrastructure</em>.</p><p>Fraud develops <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/the-fraud-supply-chain/">a supply chain</a>. Some elements in the supply chain are dual-use; the bad guys use Excel for the same reason every business uses Excel. Some elements in the supply chain, though, are specialized infrastructure with no or de minimis legitimate purpose. <em>Those elements can be profiled</em>.</p><p>I worked at Stripe for several years and am currently an advisor there. Stripe does not endorse what I write in my personal spaces. In its own spaces, Stripe has discussed being able to follow fraudulent operations in sufficient detail to determine <a href="https://stripe.com/annual-updates/2024">when the operators went to lunch</a>.</p><p>Fraudsters share specialists quite frequently. They use the same incorporation agents, the same mail services, the same CPAs, the same lawyers, etc.</p><p>You can make the same observation about many communities of practice. It is a non-coincidence that many tech startups are at 548 Market Street in San Francisco. 548 Market Street is not the world’s hippest coworking space. It is the address for <a href="https://www.earthclassmail.com/">EarthClassMail</a> in SF. There are many P.O. box providers in the world; many geeks with taste reach for ECM. (Bits about Money is <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/general/can-spam">legally required</a> to maintain a postal address and, if you were ever to send it a physical letter, that would also end up in the hands of an EarthClassMail employee.)</p><p>Elsewhere in the world, there exist P.O. box providers whose customers statistically include fewer AI labs and more frauds. One imagines the specialist-in-fraud at the storefront, picking up the day’s take from fifteen separate boxes.</p><p>Elementary work graphing supporting infrastructure, even on something as unsophisticated as <a href="https://x.com/patio11/status/1886922461918248987?s=20">butcher paper</a>, frequently unravels fraud networks. Data science has any number of more sophisticated approaches. Jetson Leder-Luis, an academic who now routinely works with the government, has <a href="https://www.complexsystemspodcast.com/episodes/defrauding-government-jetson-leder-luis/">previously discussed</a> some approaches which work based on widely commercially available data sources.</p><p>There is an emerging defender’s advantage here in the age of LLMs, since exploratory work in visualizing and walking network graphs is getting much cheaper. You no longer need to buy Palantir and engage a “forward-deployed engineer” to cluster IP addresses. A non-technical fraud investigator could get an LLM to do that while eating at Chipotle, and the lunch would cost more.</p><p>This democratization of capabilities is relevant to journalists, formal and otherwise, and also to governments. RFPs and software contracting once de facto mandated a multi-year lead time to do an automated network analysis if an analyst thought perhaps their program might need one. Now that is an afternoon’s work, if we allow ourselves to do it. We should.</p><h3 id="investigators-should-expect-to-find-ethnically-clustered-fraud">Investigators should expect to find ethnically-clustered fraud</h3><p>As mentioned, there is enormous visceral distaste for the conclusion that a particular fraud ring operates within a particular community. This is quite common. You should expect to find circumstances which rhyme with it when conducting effective fraud investigations. You should not abandon fraud investigation when you chance upon this.</p><p>People assume a level of ethical fraughtness here which is not warranted. You would, if doing ethnographic work on perfectly legitimate businesses across industries, routinely discover ethnic concentration rather than population-level representation everywhere you looked. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Life-Behind-Lobby-Indian-American/dp/0804778833">Patels run the motels</a>. One doesn’t need to adopt grand theories about how certain groups are predisposed to becoming pharmacists or startup employees or line cooks; simple microeconomic reasoning explains reality easily. Firms hire the people they already know, like, and trust. That will routinely include friends and family, who are going to be much more like the founding team than they are like randomly drawn members of the population. This is <em>the default outcome</em>.</p><p>Fraudsters do have one structural factor here. Everyone wants to trust their coworkers. Fraudsters need to trust their coworkers will be loyal <em>even upon threat of prison time</em>. That necessarily selects for tighter bonds than the typical workplace. Madoff was a family affair, SBF was in an on-again off-again romantic relationship with a chief lieutenant, and neither of those facts is accidental or incidental.</p><p>That’s the other ethical dimension of being other-than-blind to concentration: so-called <a href="https://www.sec.gov/about/reports-publications/investorpubsaffinity">affinity frauds</a> do not merely recruit <em>fraudsters</em> from affinity groups. They recruit <em>victims</em> from affinity groups. Madoff mobilized the social infrastructure of the Jewish community in New York and Palm Beach to find his marks. Community members certainly did not <em>intend</em> their charitable foundations to be looted by a fraudster. It was an emergent consequence of trust networks.</p><p>This also happens to “chosen” communities. FTX was, in material part, an affinity fraud against effective altruists, who are not a religion or ethnic group as traditionally construed.</p><p>And so when the great and the good turn a blind eye towards abuses because the perpetrators share an uncomfortable common factor, they are often simultaneously turning a blind eye towards abuses <em>of a community whose interests they purport to champion</em>.</p><h3 id="high-growth-rate-opportunities-attract-frauds">High growth rate opportunities attract frauds</h3><p>As covered extensively in Lying for Money, the necessary fundamental conceit of a fraud is growth in a business that doesn’t happen in the real world. “Every lie told incurs a debt to the truth, and one day, that debt will be paid”, to quote the excellent drama mini-series Chernobyl. Fraudsters forestall that day of reckoning by telling a bigger lie, increasing the debt, which (mostly as a side effect) alleges that they’re growing much faster than most of your legitimate portfolio. Happily, many businesses have figured out how to keep track of fast-growing customers. Tracking rocketships doesn’t require rocket science.</p><p>Sort-by-growth-rate-descending on new accounts will turn up a lot of interesting observations about the world. One is that Fortune 500 companies sometimes open new accounts, and you probably don’t need to open a fraud investigation file in that case. Another is that some people claim to be feeding millions of meals to a community of tens of thousands of people, beginning from a standing start, and growing local social services at a rate which an Uber Eats city manager would not expect to achieve in the wildest dreams of their go-to-market plan.</p><p>Feeding Our Future had a CAGR of 578% sustained for 2 years. Uber, during their meteoric growth period in core rideshare services, had an average CAGR of 226%. Their <em>best year </em>was 369%. But, if you asked in Minneapolis in 2021, you’d quickly find someone who had been in an Uber, but fail to find anyone who ate courtesy of Feeding Our Future. So curious, given that they were drubbing one of the fastest growing companies in history on growth rate.</p><p>Investigators in Minnesota were ringing the alarm bells for years about implausibly fast growth in Feeding Our Future’s reimbursement requests, including at new facilities. Feeding Our Future felt it was maxed out on the fraud it could conduct at existing sites, and expanded voraciously, including (most prominently) enrolling numerous restaurants as “feeding sites.” They then copy/pasted the usual playbook and requested reimbursement for implausible volumes at those sites, paying kickbacks to many participants. This then required growing the fraud, which… you get the general idea. We could have gotten off the bus at many points, and I suppose that is at some level a question of political will.</p><p>The highest growth rates in the economy generally are newer fields (you basically can’t sustain the alternative). This doesn’t imply that those fields are fraudulent, but they will tend to <em>disproportionately attract frauds</em>. The defenders in those fields have not yet paid their tuition to the School of Hard Knocks, and so attackers target the weaker systems. The higher growth rates of legitimate businesses function as protective cover for high stated growth rates of illegitimate businesses; a CAGR of 1,000% looks implausible for a restaurant but barely-meets-expectations for an AI software shop.</p><p>And, not to put too fine a point on it, many people are invested, literally and metaphorically, in whatever today’s new hotness is. People who could not secure an allocation in the more legitimate ends of it will sometimes find themselves adversarially selected by less salubrious actors. This will read to those people as a <em>justly earned success</em>. They might even have their marketing department <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221109025610/https:/www.sequoiacap.com/article/sam-bankman-fried-spotlight/">write up their victimization</a> as <a href="https://www.sba.gov/article/2020/jul/06/sba-treasury-announce-release-paycheck-protection-program-loan-data">an indisputable success</a>.</p><p>And so, if you’re a defender who has many different lines of business and has limited resources (or political will), where should you deploy those resources? Should you place your bets on e.g. Social Security, a multi-trillion dollar program whose primary source of growth is fun to conjure but then requires 70 years of seasoning? Or should you place them on the <a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-23-105331">Paycheck Protection Program</a>, or <a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-23-106696">pandemic-era unemployment insurance</a>, or <a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/newsroom/media-materials/media-materials-nationwide-genetic-testing-fraud/">genetic testing</a>, or <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-22-105447.pdf">non-emergency medical transportation</a>? Despite those being smaller line items, they probably have more juice worth squeezing, and the fraud is more easily detectable. Just <em>look</em>.</p><h3 id="fraudsters-find-the-weakest-links-in-the-financial-system">Fraudsters find the weakest links in the financial system</h3><p>Bits about Money has extensively covered <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/money-laundering-and-aml-compliance/">anti-moneylaundering</a> and <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/kyc-and-aml-beyond-the-acronyms/">Know Your Customer regulations</a> and I won’t rehash those regimes here. A bit of tacit knowledge in the financial industry: some actors in the set “broadly considered trustworthy” are more worthy of trust than others… and some are less.</p><p>We are generally discreet about writing this down in as many words. But, as an analogy, cross-national regulatory bodies require that financial institutions maintain a list of high-risk jurisdictions to do business in. You are generally required to do enhanced due diligence on customers/activities/etc touching the high-risk list.</p><p>If you are particularly competent, and there are plusses and minuses to being competent in detecting fraud (you will <em>not</em> be the most popular person in the firm at bonus time; that goes to the folks who sold the high-growth accounts), you might have the analogous list of U.S. financial institutions which are <em>not entirely fronts for the bad guys</em>.</p><p>If one hypothetically has that list, that’s one more signal you can use in evaluating any particular account, and a one-stop shop for developing a list of accounts to look into. It would be uncouth of me to name an extant bank that has poor controls, but for a general example of the flavor, see my (scathing) <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/debanking-and-debunking/#so-called-choke-point-20">commentary on Silvergate’s AML and KYC program</a>. Without using any proprietary information, I predict confidently that Silvergate banked many more multi-billion dollar frauds as a percentage of its customer base than almost any of the U.S.’s 4,500 banks. (Trivial substantiation: divide FTXes-banked by total-count-of-customers.)</p><p>One might, if one has never seen the list, wonder whether it is simply proxying for something the financial industry is <em>definitely not allowed to proxy for</em>. One of the first things you learn as a data analyst is zip codes are extremely probative and <em>you are absolutely not allowed to use them</em>. The American system remembers the experience of redlining and has forbidden the financial industry from ever doing it again; the industry mostly respects that. But good news: institutions with weak controls environments are not, in fact, simply a proxy for “Who banks socially disadvantaged people?” There are many financial institutions that have that as an explicit business model. Some of them are good at their jobs. Some, less so, <em>and the fraudsters know it</em>.</p><p>This sometimes happens with the knowing connivance of the financial institution and/or their staff. For much more on that, see <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Best-Way-Rob-Bank-Own/dp/0292754183">histories</a> of the savings and loan crisis, or the Lying for Money chapter on control frauds. But more commonly it is simply a community of practice developing organic knowledge about who is just <em>very easy to get an account with</em>. You need accounts, as a business. As a fraudulent business, which intends to cycle through accounts and identities at a much higher rate than baseline, you would prefer to do business with a bank which will not detect that malfeasance.</p><p>And so you will disproportionately end up banked, with many of your buddies, at the least attentive place still capable of getting a license. And so an agency, trying to find a fraudulent network, might want to look at fraud-cases-by-routing-number and then start making some judgment calls.</p><p>One of the reasons the government has deputized the financial industry is it is good at keeping spreadsheets and quickly responds to requests for them. Perhaps the government should call up a few of their deputies and say “So, not <em>alleging</em> anything here, but we think you might have <em>a list</em>, carefully maintained by your fraud department for your own purposes. We want to see the list. It would be pro-social of you to give us a copy of it.”</p><h3 id="frauds-openly-suborn-identities">Frauds openly suborn identities</h3><p>There is a thriving market in identities to be used in fraud. This is because bad actors prefer not putting their own names on paper trails certain to become evidence, because they frequently “burn” themselves early in their careers, and because institutions have cottoned onto the wisdom of collecting lists of ultimate beneficiaries.</p><p>Sometimes this is a social process, conducted at e.g. the dinner table. Sometimes the market is explicitly a market. <a href="https://www.complexsystemspodcast.com/episodes/defrauding-government-jetson-leder-luis/">Jetson recounted</a> that, having exhausted the supply of patients needing dialysis who could plausibly need ambulance services, frauds began bribing potential patients, first with donuts and then with cash. This is <em>extremely common</em>. In Minnesota, parents were recruited to childcare providers with the promise of cash kickbacks or (a detail we’ll return to in a moment) fictitious paperworked no-show jobs, sometimes at substantially fictitious companies.</p><p>Fraudsters <em>sometimes</em> exercise some level of operational discipline in their communications. The bad guys have also seen The Wire; they know Stringer Bell’s dictum on the wisdom of keeping notes on a criminal conspiracy. However, the population of people willing to be named in a federal indictment over $200 necessarily selects preferentially for individuals who are not experts at operational security. They will sometimes organize recruitment very openly, using the same channels you use for recruiting at any other time: open Facebook groups, Reddit threads, and similar. They will film TikTok videos flashing their ill-gotten gains, and explaining steps in order for how you, too, can get paid.</p><p>As a fraud investigator, you are allowed and encouraged to read Facebook at work.</p><p>Now, knowing that there exists the frequent epiphenomenon where fraudsters recruit strawmen to use their identities to qualify for payments: suppose that you have an entirely new enterprise whose first customers are individuals A, B, C, and D. You know, from past records, that A, B, C, and D have all been customers of an organization which you now know, positively, was a fraudulent actor. You might infer from this that A, B, C, and D <em>might have</em> sold their identities once, but you probably don’t have sufficient information to convict them in a court of law of that. (It is of course possible that they are simply unsophisticated, or that bad actors obtained their information without their knowledge, for example by misappropriating a client list from a previous corporate entity they happened to own/work for/etc.)</p><p>But do you have enough information to take a more-detailed-than-usual look at this totally new enterprise? <em>I think you do</em>.</p><h3 id="asymmetry-in-attacker-and-defender-burdens-of-proof">Asymmetry in attacker and defender burdens of proof</h3><p>We have choices, as the defender, in what levels of evidence we require to enter the circle of trust, what our epistemological standards are, and how much evidence we require to forcibly exit someone from the circle of trust.</p><p>A detail from the Minnesota cases is that these burdens are asymmetric, in a way which disadvantages the defender (all of us). That decision <em>is a choice</em> and we should make better choices.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, the primary evidence of a child attending a day-care was a handwritten sign-in sheet of minimal probative value. Prosecutors referred to them as “almost comical” and “useless.” They were routinely fraudulently filled out by a 17 year old “signing” for dozens of parents sequentially in the same handwriting, excepting cases where they were <em>simply empty</em>.</p><p>To refute this “evidence”, the state forced itself to do weeks of stakeouts, producing hundreds of hours of video recording, after which it laboriously reconstructed exact counts of children seen entering/exiting a facility, compared it with the billing records, and then invoiced the centers <em>only for proven overbilling</em>.</p><p>On general industry knowledge, if you are selected for examination in e.g. your credit card processing account, and your submission of evidence is “Oh yeah, those transactions are ones we customarily paperwork with a 17 year old committing obvious fraud”, your account <em>will be swiftly closed</em>. The financial institution doesn’t have to reach a conclusion about every dollar which has ever flowed through your account. What actual purpose would there be in shutting the barn door after the horse has left? The only interesting question is what you’ll be doing tomorrow, and clearly what you intend to do tomorrow <em>is fraud</em>.</p><p>We can architect the asymmetry in the other fashion: legitimate businesses will customarily, as a fact of their operations, put enormous effort into creating visible effects in the world which are trivial to check. In technologist circles this is sometimes called a “proof of work” function.</p><p>Once upon a time, a team of fraud analysts asked how they could possibly determine frauds from non-frauds without having extensive industry knowledge about every possible commercializable human activity. I suggested that a good first pass was “Just ask the correspondent for a quick video, shot on their cell phone, of their workspace.”</p><p>That is minimally invasive for the business owner, generates a huge amount of signal (including that which can be correlated across accounts), and can be usefully adjudicated by non-specialists in a minute. No multi-month stakeout of their storefront is required. Of course you can convincingly fake a video of working in, say, a machine shop, but fraudsters maintaining spreadsheet row 87 about the machine shop will find that difficult to juggle with all the other required lies in their backlog. Actual machine shops, meanwhile, include people, which means they include functional cell phone cameras at no additional cost to anyone.</p><p>You can also get some signal from who can trivially produce a video and who needs a week of advance notice to find a cell phone to record those machines that were absolutely milling aluminum last week.</p><p>Fundamentally, we have a choice about where we put our investments in defanging fraud, and we should stop choosing to lose.</p><p>So-called “pay-and-chase”, where we put the burden on the government to disallow payments for violations retrospectively, has been enormously expensive and ineffective. Civil liability bounces off of exists-only-to-defraud LLC. Criminal prosecutions, among the most expensive kinds of intervention the government is capable of doing short of kinetic war, result in only a ~20% reduction in fraudulent behavior. Rearchitecting the process to require prior authorization resulted in an “immediate and permanent” 68% reduction. (I commend to you <a href="https://marriner-wpmedia.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dialysis_Ambulance_Fraud.pdf">this research</a> on Medicare fraud regarding dialysis transport. And yes, the team did some interesting work to distinguish fraudulent from legitimate usage of the program. Non-emergency transport for dialysis specifically had exploded in reimbursements—see Figure 1— not because American kidneys suddenly got worse but because fraudsters adversarially targeted an identified weakness in Medicare.)</p><p>Attackers carefully respond to signals they think they are being sent from defenders. A lawyer for some of the Minnesota defendants, Ryan Pacyga, was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/29/us/fraud-minnesota-somali.html">quoted</a> by the New York Times as saying that his clients understood Minnesota to tacitly allow their actions.</p><p>&gt; No one was doing anything about the red flags. … It was like someone was stealing money from the cookie jar and they kept refilling it.</p><p>Don’t be the defender who sends that message. It will not work out well for you or your program.</p><h3 id="fraudsters-under-paperwork-their-epiphenomena">Fraudsters under-paperwork their epiphenomena</h3><p>Most frauds have rich external lives, with a soaring narrative of how deserving people are getting valuable services (and/or getting rich for being right and early regarding e.g. crypto asset cross-margining). They tend to be distinctly underpaperworked internally, partly because a synonym for “paperwork” is “evidence” and partly because… most frauds aren’t really that sophisticated, when it comes down to it. There is a true number; lie about it; <em>done</em>.</p><p>Like many time-pressed entrepreneurs busy talking to potential customers, fraudsters put the minimal amount of time necessary into bookkeeping and even less than that into paperworking epiphenomena of their frauds. One example of epiphenomena is sometimes the beneficiaries need <em>their own</em> paperwork. A legitimate mortgage company employs sales reps and a backoffice to help unsophisticated customers successfully get <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/mortgages-are-a-manufactured-product/">several hundred pages of paperwork together to sell a mortgage</a>. Frauds… mostly don’t do that.</p><p>And so, if you have e.g. a statutory requirement that a beneficiary be employed to access services, a fraudster might say “Don’t worry about it!” They’ll just assert that you are an employee at a cleaning company. Perhaps they might even go as far as <em>payrolling you</em> as an employee of a cleaning company. This kills two birds with one stone, paying you your kickback while also generating the paystub they need you to have to qualify for the government reimbursement. (This happened, per the OLA’s reports summarizing the results of many investigations, in Minnesota.)</p><p>But fraudsters <em>don’t actually operate cleaning companies </em>even in those cases where they <em>do operate daycares</em>.</p><p>Cleaning companies are legitimate businesses, in the main, and working for one is an honest occupation. And so a fraud investigator should feel no chagrin at calling a cleaning company in the phone book and asking for a quote. A cleaning company which expresses complete befuddlement that someone could ask for a quote is providing, ahem, evidence in a direction.</p><p>(I have to note, as someone who pays to send children to a private school, that there is replete evidence that the school is accepting new children, knocking on the door and asking will quickly result in being given a brochure, and there are scheduled open houses and similar. I can imagine a gratuitously mismanaged educational establishment which does none of these things, and I can imagine an educational establishment which makes a lot of money, but I have trouble holding both thoughts in my head at the same time.)</p><p>The core frauds are sometimes hardened, to an attenuated degree. The peripheral frauds collapse under even a glance. Architect processes to require more signals regarding the periphery, then architect a system which takes at least a cursory look at the periphery. You will trivially catch frauds.</p><p>If you’re worried about exposing the exact signal that you are using, costing utility of it in the future, you can use this as a “parallel construction” engine. Develop leads for investigation using the non-public signal, pull the core records as a matter of routine, find the discrepancies that all frauds leave in their core records, and then put <em>those</em> in the indictment. Ask your friendly neighborhood lawyer if that passes muster or if you need to add a sentence rhyming with “was selected for a routine audit on the basis of information available to the department.”</p><h3 id="machine-learning-can-adaptively-identify-fraud">Machine learning can adaptively identify fraud</h3><p>We have discussed some heuristics [1] for identifying fraud. The financial industry still makes material use of heuristics, but a heuristic is a compression of the real world. It will sometimes lose fidelity to the world. It will frequently, <em>by design</em>, be legible to the adversary.</p><p>The defender has one advantage the attacker cannot ever replicate: data at scale. It knows what legitimate use looks like because it has all the messy, contradictory, varying quality, typos-and-all data <em>which legitimate businesses in the real world constantly throw off</em>. You cannot duplicate all of the shadows on the wall of Plato’s cave without first duplicating the entire world. Fraudsters, even quite talented ones, can’t do that.</p><p>There are any number of techniques for machine learning in anti-fraud; <a href="https://www.complexsystemspodcast.com/episodes/the-past-present-and-future-of-ai-with-stripe/">Emily Sands has previously discussed some with me</a>. An important subset of the field can adapt in real-time or close to it to changes in adversary (or legitimate!) behavior. For example, covid surprised the fraudsters at the same time as it surprised every supermarket in the country, but the ex-post actions of the fraudsters and the supermarkets were <em>very different</em>. Revenue went up for both, but only one group <em>actually runs a supermarket</em>. And so by ingesting and constantly analyzing data from all users, including retrospective annotation of which users you’ve identified to be frauds, you get better <em>and earlier</em> signals on which users are likely fraudulent and which are likely not.</p><p>This can inform outright interdiction or the investigate-then-punish loop that we ordinarily expect from government. It can also inform less consequential, easier-to-reverse interventions. For example, rather than putting all users immediately through the highest-possible-ceremony process for application, you can let most users do a lower-burden process, saving the higher levels of scrutiny for those which signal greater likelihood of being fraudulent. Or you can default to approving more applicants and reserve more of your investigatory budget for post-approval review, with this being equivalently costly by using better tasking of those reviews versus random allocation. Pay-and-chase becomes more palatable if it is not pay-and-pay-and-pay-and-pay-and-chase and more pay-until-we-decide-to-chase-but-stop-payments-at-that-decision-not-after-the-catching.</p><p>Machine learning isn’t simply useful from a perspective of decreasing fraud. The history of regulation of benefits programs is the history of too-late, too-harsh overcorrection to notorious abuses. Much of what advocates find most maddening and Kafkaesque about eligibility criteria and application processes was voted on by a legislature but bears the signature of a fraudster with a novel idea.</p><p>With a good machine learning practice, you can increase data ingested but decrease the burdensome formal application/etc requirements. This is in no small part because those data points are less probative (they are under the direct control of the attacker and <em>announce</em> that they will be scrutinized). But it bears a dividend: if you better control fraud, and can successfully demonstrate that to the public and legislators, you can <em>decrease application burden</em> and perhaps even <em>widen eligibility criteria</em>. Those are both in the direct interests of potential marginal beneficiaries.</p><p>A political commentator might focus more on the optics here than on the substance, because that is so frequently where the point of actual leverage is in politics. But the substantive reality of fraud losses <em>matters</em>. It is much easier to tell the story of fraud in benefits programs being rare, opposed by all right-thinking people, and swiftly sanctioned when that story is not <em>an obvious lie</em>.</p><h3 id="frauds-have-a-lifecycle">Frauds have a lifecycle</h3><p>You can read Lying for Money or other histories of frauds for more detail on the texture, but in the main, a dedicated fraudulent enterprise is created, is seasoned for a while before crossing the rubicon, has a period of increasing brazenness, is detected, is closed, and then is resurrected when the fraudster gets the band back together from round N+1.</p><p>We can intervene against the lifecycle model if we understand it. This begins with not defaulting to the understanding of investigators that frauds are isolated incidents by disparate individual actors. Those have been known to happen, but frauds are, by total damage, dominated by repeatable business models perpetrated by professional specialized bad actors. We should study them like we study other successful entrepreneurs, and then <em>not</em> invest in them.</p><p>One actionable insight from the lifecycle model: because the fraudster intends to be in business multiple times in their life, we should track the person-to-business mapping much more closely than we have historically. As Lying for Money says, if you’re an accountant and willing to go to prison, and you do not get rich via fraud… well, you are very bad at your job. That’s on you. When we give you <em>repeated chances to do it</em>, that’s on us.</p><p>One might think that the simplest imaginable reform is passing some sort of beneficial ownership regulation to unroll complex corporate structures designed to obscure who is actually puppeting Totally Not A Fraud, LLC. But the simplest imaginable reform is probably just <em>actually reading</em> corporate filings that already exist and are public. Again, most fraudsters are not the hypersophisticated Moriarties of the popular imagination. The Minnesota fraudsters frequently did not even bother with fig leaves. While they did find some nominee directors in some cases, many of the convicted operated their companies in their own names, with no complicated structuring at all. Sometimes multiple times, consecutively, after the previous entities had worn out their welcome with Minnesota.</p><p>The Fed should not be <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/enf20230817a1.pdf">surprised when the bad guys buy a bank</a> when buying a bank requires an extended permission-seeking process and the bad guy’s corporate records, dutifully recorded <a href="https://egov.maryland.gov/BusinessExpress/EntitySearch/Business">by Maryland</a> (entity D20033544), are signed by a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-10-07/crypto-mystery-where-s-the-69-billion-backing-the-stablecoin-tether">notorious bagman</a>. In the Fed’s defense, the bagman <em>lied to them about his intentions</em>, which was outside of their world model. (Pip pip to the New York Times for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/23/business/ftx-cryptocurrency-bank.html">figuring that out</a> before the Fed did. That is, sadly, not the usual way it works in financial journalism.)</p><h2 id="should-we-care-about-fraud-investigation-anyway">Should we care about fraud investigation, anyway?</h2><p>Responsible actors in civil society have a mandate to aggressively detect and interdict fraud. If they do not, they cede the field to irresponsible demagogues. They will not be careful in their conclusions. They will not be gentle in their proposals. They will not carefully weigh consequences upon the innocent. But they will be telling a truth that the great and the good are not.</p><p>The public will believe them, because the public believes its lying eyes.</p><p>[0] In a thing you will see frequently in fraud investigations, early detection of anomalies does not necessarily imply successful identification of the underlying fraudulent enterprise. A teacher was scandalized that a third of their students are using AI to write papers. Those “<a href="https://abc30.com/post/ghost-students-digital-network-thieves-posing-major-threat-ca-community-colleges/18496090/">students</a>” are identities puppeted by a criminal organization to siphon federal funding out of community colleges towards accounts controlled by the criminals. (I award myself one cookie for <a href="https://x.com/patio11/status/1802036665503899781">correctly predicting this</a>.)</p><p>[1] A heuristic, in industry parlance, is a hard-coded rule or set of rules as opposed to a system which automatically adapts to changes in the underlying data. Compare the difference between “You are less likely to default on loans if you own versus renting”, which is absolutely demonstrable in aggregate data, versus “You are less likely to default on loans at 780 FICO versus 540 FICO.” For a variety of reasons, the culture that is legislators sees the problem with having one heuristic, which will obviously not come to the correct conclusion all of the time. It corrects for this issue by having several hundred pages of heuristics. Just one more heuristic, man, and we’ll have completely anticipated all the complexity of the world.</p><p>Heuristics are wonderful things! They’re cheap to adjudicate, easy to explain, and can be understood by lawyers, even the kind who have ascended from the practice of law to the writing of it. Happily, machine learning systems can have all of these properties if you make them priorities.</p>

What riders and local communities don’t see is our Driver navigating billions of miles in virtual worlds, mastering complex scenarios long before it encounters them on public roads. Today, we are excited to introduce the Waymo World Model, a frontier generative model that sets a new bar for large-scale, hyper-realistic autonomous driving simulation.&nbsp;</p><figure><w-autoplay-guard><video muted="" playsinline="" data-maybe-autoplay="" loop="" preload="auto"><source src="https://videos.ctfassets.net/7ijaobx36mtm/4WAFYsuPA964qm937ooAm0/bd1e232de236794e89f6daa89b594b93/topline_video_close_loop_sim_cropped.webm" type="video/webm"><source src="https://videos.ctfassets.net/7ijaobx36mtm/MYTRduQ4UI2H6368so4k7/b8229593baf95651606a39348516edd8/topline_video_closed_loop_sim_cropped.mp4" type="video/mp4"><p>Your web browser does not support this video.</p></video></w-autoplay-guard><figcaption><p>Simulation of the Waymo Driver evading a vehicle going in the wrong direction. The simulation initially follows a real event, and seamlessly transitions to using camera and lidar images automatically generated by an efficient real-time Waymo World Model.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Simulation is a critical component of Waymo’s AI ecosystem and one of the three key pillars of our approach to <a href="https://waymo.com/blog/2025/12/demonstrably-safe-ai-for-autonomous-driving"><u>demonstrably safe AI</u></a>. The Waymo World Model, which we detail below, is the component that is responsible for generating hyper-realistic simulated environments.</p><p>The Waymo World Model is built upon <a href="https://deepmind.google/blog/genie-3-a-new-frontier-for-world-models/"><u>Genie 3</u></a>—Google DeepMind's most advanced general-purpose world model that generates photorealistic and interactive 3D environments—and is adapted for the rigors of the driving domain. By leveraging Genie’s immense world knowledge, it can simulate exceedingly rare events—from a tornado to a casual encounter with an elephant—that are almost impossible to capture at scale in reality. The model’s architecture offers high controllability, allowing our engineers to modify simulations with simple language prompts, driving inputs, and scene layouts. Notably, the Waymo World Model generates high-fidelity, multi-sensor outputs that include both camera and lidar data.</p><p>This combination of broad world knowledge, fine-grained controllability, and multi-modal realism enhances Waymo’s ability to safely scale our service across more places and new driving environments. In the following sections we showcase the Waymo World Model in action, featuring simulations of the Waymo Driver navigating diverse rare edge-case scenarios.</p><h3 id="emergent-multimod">🌎 Emergent Multimodal World Knowledge</h3><p>Most simulation models in the autonomous driving industry are trained from scratch based on only the on-road data they collect. That approach means the system only learns from limited experience. Genie 3’s strong world knowledge, gained from its pre-training on an extremely large and diverse set of videos, allows us to explore situations that were never directly observed by our fleet.</p><p>Through our specialized post-training, we are transferring that vast world knowledge from 2D video into 3D lidar outputs unique to Waymo’s hardware suite. While cameras excel at depicting visual details, lidar sensors provide valuable complementary signals like precise depth. The Waymo World Model can generate virtually any scene—from regular, day-to-day driving to rare, long-tail scenarios—across multiple sensor modalities.</p><h5 id="extreme-weather"><b>🌪️ Extreme weather conditions and natural disasters</b></h5><div><w-equalize-heights><w-carousel loop="true"><ul data-slot="slides-container"><li id="P0-0-slide-0" data-index="0" aria-current="true"><w-media><figure><div><w-autoplay-guard><video muted="" playsinline="" data-maybe-autoplay="" loop="" preload="auto" tabindex="-1" data-equalize-heights="slide-asset"><source src="https://videos.ctfassets.net/7ijaobx36mtm/784EOrH0Jy8s702T8plcx5/3ce22b07dde57095d6e65364cda0a421/020_IP_Straight_Final_W12.webm" type="video/webm"><source src="https://videos.ctfassets.net/7ijaobx36mtm/sGRJJxaoSP2KoutDztOfV/bf02a3ebf193312d4b540973115d0484/world_knowledge_snowy_ggbridge_og_joint.mp4" type="video/mp4"><p>Your web browser does not support this video.</p></video></w-autoplay-guard></div><figcaption><p>Simulation: Driving on the Golden Gate Bridge, covered in light snow.

simulation controllability through three main mechanisms: driving action control, scene layout control, and language control.</p><p><b>Driving action control</b> allows us to have a responsive simulator that adheres to specific driving inputs. This enables us to simulate “what if” counterfactual events such as whether the Waymo Driver could have safely driven more confidently instead of yielding in a particular situation.</p><p><i>Counterfactual driving.</i><b> </b>We demonstrate simulations both under the original route in a past recorded drive, or a completely new route. While purely reconstructive simulation methods (e.g., 3D Gaussian Splats, or 3DGS) suffer from visual breakdowns due to missing observations when the simulated route is too different from the original driving, the fully learned Waymo World Model maintains good realism and consistency thanks to its strong generative capabilities.</p><div><w-equalize-heights><w-carousel loop="true"><ul data-slot="slides-container"><li id="P0-0-slide-0" data-index="0" aria-current="true"><w-media><figure><div><w-autoplay-guard><video muted="" playsinline="" data-maybe-autoplay="" loop="" preload="auto" tabindex="-1" data-equalize-heights="slide-asset"><source src="https://videos.ctfassets.net/7ijaobx36mtm/6OYJoJ78BN34vKwiLj4ajm/de0073fdaf96846ae6b1f25104ee6b01/final1_merged.webm" type="video/webm"><source src="https://videos.ctfassets.net/7ijaobx36mtm/3ZSSI5LY0g7MVMuiPrwmVR/2052051441f0cac184e8acc5f443cb3b/final1_merged.mp4" type="video/mp4"><p>Your web browser does not support this video.</p></video></w-autoplay-guard></div></figure></w-media></li><li id="P0-0-slide-1" data-index="1"><w-media><figure><div><w-autoplay-guard><video muted="" playsinline="" data-maybe-autoplay="" loop="" preload="none" tabindex="-1" data-equalize-heights="slide-asset"><source src="https://videos.ctfassets.net/7ijaobx36mtm/2zTZKR14w9qidRRQt5iSzR/ad61b7935bbc7734215fcd18bd1ddbf2/final2_merged.webm" type="video/webm"><source src="https://videos.ctfassets.net/7ijaobx36mtm/1Ei0koxxgQmnOutUZdyFzN/d062c892b66fa04e38770d27731b3263/final2_merged.mp4" type="video/mp4"><p>Your web browser does not support this video.</p></video></w-autoplay-guard></div></figure></w-media></li><li id="P0-0-slide-2" data-index="2"><w-media><figure><div><w-autoplay-guard><video muted="" playsinline="" data-maybe-autoplay="" loop="" preload="none" tabindex="-1" data-equalize-heights="slide-asset"><source src="https://videos.ctfassets.net/7ijaobx36mtm/3Q5jVioj0ra78XV2LLYIDl/d37a967c950f21a872cbde017597276d/final3_merged.webm" type="video/webm"><source src="https://videos.ctfassets.net/7ijaobx36mtm/3bpSzfPHEKNNfzDaMLIzCK/9028583da5df9bc09ba7de452e5b3a1a/final3_merged.mp4" type="video/mp4"><p>Your web browser does not support this video.</p></video></w-autoplay-guard></div></figure></w-media></li><li id="P0-0-slide-3" data-index="3"><w-media><figure><div><w-autoplay-guard><video muted="" playsinline="" data-maybe-autoplay="" loop="" preload="none" tabindex="-1" data-equalize-heights="slide-asset"><source src="https://videos.ctfassets.net/7ijaobx36mtm/5vDoSed8230fQZOPy9cyFA/db0e7acd7b83f51dd662cae4abeabe0d/final4_merged.webm" type="video/webm"><source src="https://videos.ctfassets.net/7ijaobx36mtm/6LPA0otikaS9vXwy7N3sae/2563894f6d6c69285f28b69ebbdd77be/final4_merged.mp4" type="video/mp4"><p>Your web browser does not support this video.</p></video></w-autoplay-guard></div></figure></w-media></li><li id="P0-0-slide-4" data-index="4"><w-media><figure><div><w-autoplay-guard><video muted="" playsinline="" data-maybe-autoplay="" loop="" preload="none" tabindex="-1" data-equalize-heights="slide-asset"><source src="https://videos.ctfassets.net/7ijaobx36mtm/7tynEJ9qQxAyTMged62Fr7/3471bf1df4d1357f46c795b4b31de4e0/final5_merged.webm" type="video/webm"><source src="https://videos.ctfassets.net/7ijaobx36mtm/5YdYLuoeuDkNoXBPZaSy7q/3012a3ab80c59fe9f7a1a3658bc9659f/final5_merged.mp4" type="video/mp4"><p>Your web browser does not support this video.</p></video></w-autoplay-guard></div></figure></w-media></li></ul></w-carousel></w-equalize-heights></div><p><b>Scene layout control</b> allows for customization of the road layouts, traffic signal states, and the behavior of other road users.

After finding out that the city council was considering a housing element that would have bowed to NIMBY pressure, we sent two letters to the city, reminding it of its legal obligations under state law to approve the upzoning — and that a failure to do so would open the city up to a lawsuit. Not only were we well within our rights to send those letters, we were right on the merits too.</p><p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JJTq_EmAmftTmmeWtEwLXbYBMoca1K5e/edit" rel="">As we wrote in the second letter</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>The options in front of you are to respect the efforts of your staff which led to a Housing Element and subsequent rezoning AND an application consistent with those measures, or to waste time and open yourselves to our lawsuit while crippling your ability to meet the statutory RHNA obligation.</p></blockquote><p><span>These letters, which we often send to cities, are frankly delightful to send. Thanks to our work and the work of our allies, city councils in California tempted to vote against fulfilling their housing obligations are hemmed in from three directions — either </span><a href="https://www.hcd.ca.gov/sites/default/files/docs/planning-and-community/sb-9-fact-sheet.pdf" rel="">approving the housing under SB 9</a><span>, facing the </span><a href="https://www.yimbylaw.org/buildersremedy" rel="">builder’s remedy</a><span>, or </span><a href="https://sfyimby.com/2023/03/twelve-years-after-proposal-terrace-of-lafayette-approval-upheld-by-court.html" rel="">a lawsuit under the Housing Accountability Act</a><span>. All roads lead to new housing. It’s delightful.</span></p><p><span>But NIMBYs in SoCal were less delighted. As you might have read in the </span><a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/realestate/article/sonja-trauss-yimby-21309436.php" rel="">San Francisco Chronicle</a><span>, one of them filed a complaint with the California State Bar, saying that I was practicing law without a license. They said because I’m not an attorney (which is true), I was offering “legal analysis,” which only licensed attorneys are allowed to do.</span></p><p>Here’s an excerpt of the letter that the state bar sent me (I’m leaving out the name of the person who filed the complaint, but keeping their typos).</p><blockquote><p>Our office has received a complaint [...] alleging that you are practicing law without a license in California. The complaint alleges that you [and] Yimby Law writes letters to CA cities threatening legal action and stating incorrect housing laws and city ordinance laws.</p><p>REDACTED includes with [their] complaint a copy of a letter you sent to the City of Rancho Palos Verdes/Citty [sic] Council on March 17, 2025. Your letter provides a legal analysis related to removal of certain sites from the “Housing Site Inventory.”</p></blockquote><p><span>This is, to put it mildly, preposterous. Not only am I not holding myself out as an attorney, but, </span><a href="https://ij.org/press-release/public-interest-law-firm-stands-with-california-yimby-advocacy-group-to-protect-first-amendment-rights/" rel="">as the Institute for Justice pointed out in their response to the state bar</a><span>, sending letters like these are protected under not one but two clauses of the First Amendment — the right to free speech and the right to petition the government.</span></p><p><span>As part of our work, YIMBY Law sends letters to cities in California that remind them of their obligations under state laws like </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Housing_Accountability_Act" rel="">the Housing Accountability Act</a><span>. Those letters say something different each time, but the general gist usually is: “Hey, we saw you are thinking about taking some action that seems like it would violate state law. You shouldn’t do that. And if you do, we might sue you, and if we do we tend to win.” Most of the time, our letters never turn into lawsuits. We send a letter and city officials realize that not only are we right, it’s not worth the hassle of fighting in court. So they do the right thing. This is the kind of thing that we and other YIMBY groups have done ever since </span><a href="https://sfyimby.com/2023/03/twelve-years-after-proposal-terrace-of-lafayette-approval-upheld-by-court.html" rel="">the lawsuit against the East Bay suburb of Lafayette</a><span>. (You can see the whole list of those cases </span><a href="https://www.yimbylaw.org/past-lawsuits" rel="">here</a><span>.) Most recently, we’re </span><a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-12-10/pro-housing-group-sues-newsom-over-duplex-ban-in-wildfire-zones" rel="">suing the state of California</a><span> over the governor’s executive order restricting duplexes in the areas affected by the Palisades fire.</span></p><p>I am confident that the state bar will agree with the Institute for Justice here, which cited case after case in which the courts have held that this kind of advocacy work is squarely protected no matter if a person is an attorney, not an attorney, offering legal analysis, not offering legal analysis, right on the merits, wrong on the merits, fighting for a good cause, or fighting for a bad one.  The First Amendment protects our right to lobby the government as much as it protects the rights of the AARP, the NRA, the American Heart Association, the California Nurses Association, Liveable California, the League of California Cities, the Group In Favor of That Thing You Love, and the Group in Favor of That Thing You Absolutely Hate.</p><p>It’s important to be really clear about this — not only do NIMBYs like the one who filed this complaint think that we are wrong about housing, they don’t even think we should be allowed to argue for more housing. They don’t think we are even entitled to a fair hearing. We should all recognize that silencing your political rivals is beyond the pale and that complaints like this one, even if they end up going nowhere, can have a chilling effect on activists and ordinary people who want to exercise their rights.</p><p><span>Speaking as an activist, this kind of delegitimization is a NIMBY tactic we have to put up with all the time. Not only do NIMBYs think we are wrong, a lot of them seem to think that we don’t even get to have a say. There’s a pretty consistent undercurrent to a lot of NIMBYism that can’t even imagine why somebody would be in favor of more housing and laws that make it easier to build it. Something about us breaks their brains. That’s frustrating. Democracy only works when we can have </span><a href="https://thepointmag.com/politics/a-republic-of-discussion-habermas-at-ninety/" rel="">free-ranging conversation with each other</a><span>. The only rules really are that you should give reasons for what you believe and that you shouldn’t force anybody else out of the discussion.</span></p><p><span>There are plenty more examples. One of the first times my colleague Laura Foote, the Executive Director of YIMBY Action sent a San Francisco Supervisor an email expressing her opinion on public policy, they wrote back asking “What’s that area code, where are you from?” The message being — it wasn’t 415 and therefore she didn’t count. One of the most common tropes in the early days of press coverage was journalists implying — or outright stating — that we were shills for the real-estate industry, as if they couldn’t believe someone would actually be in favor of more housing if they weren’t being paid to do it. We still get called shills sometimes, when we aren’t being called </span><a href="https://realprogressives.substack.com/p/yimbyism-is-code-for-gentrification" rel="">gentrifiers</a><span>, </span><a href="https://allaspectreport.com/2025/06/21/the-cruel-inhumanity-of-the-yimby-movement/" rel="">inhuman</a><span>, </span><a href="https://truthout.org/articles/yimbys-the-alt-right-darlings-of-the-real-estate-industry/" rel="">alt-right</a><span>, </span><a href="https://medium.com/@tdfischer_/the-progressive-disinformation-machine-7281184cac3f" rel="">white supremacists</a><span>, and — for some reason I cannot explain — </span><a href="https://www.citywatchla.com/voices/25290-yimbyism-there-s-a-whole-lot-of-shilling-going-on" rel="">Scientologists</a><span>. (Yes In Xenu’s Backyard, I guess.)</span></p><p>It’s not just online delegitimation. It’s distressingly common that when we show up at public meetings that NIMBYs will boo and hiss at us while we are talking. Laura was at a public meeting once in Cupertino where the NIMBYs in the crowd started shouting “Where are you from? Where are you from?” She started quoting Martin Luther King saying that an “injustice anywhere is an injustice everywhere,” when a woman who later got elected to the city council ran up and pulled the microphone from her hand.</p><p><span>NIMBYs in Santa Monica convinced the state Fair Political Practices Committee that the mayor pro tem had </span><a href="https://www.smdp.com/state-regulators-say-councilman-zwick-is-conflicted-on-housing-votes/" rel="">to recuse himself</a><span> from votes on housing because he worked for the Housing Action Committee. (If you think that makes sense, ask yourself if a mayor pro tem who also happened to work for a gun control group should have to recuse themselves from voting on a gun control measure? Or, more to the point, if a mayor pro tem who owned property and didn’t want the competition should recuse themselves from a zoning vote?)</span></p><p><span>More recently, a San Rafael </span><a href="https://www.cityofsanrafael.org/public-hearing-for-project-at-700-irwin/" rel="">planning commission</a><span> hearing on a proposal for mixed-income housing became so heated that an opponent spat on a commenter supporting it.</span></p><p>In a democracy, even an imperiled one like ours, one of the most important things we can do is to not spit on each other for having different opinions. That seems pretty minimal and something that we could all agree on, even if we don’t agree on housing.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://inpractice.yimbyaction.org/p/nimbys-arent-just-shutting-down-housing?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://inpractice.yimbyaction.org/p/nimbys-arent-just-shutting-down-housing?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p></div></article></div><div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div><div><h3>Ready for more?</h3></div></div></div>]]></description>

be prepared to adapt to updates along the way.</p>
</div>
<p dir="auto">LiteBox is a sandboxing library OS that drastically cuts down the interface to the host, thereby reducing attack surface.  It focuses on easy interop of various "North" shims and "South" platforms.  LiteBox is designed for usage in both kernel and non-kernel scenarios.</p>
<p dir="auto">LiteBox exposes a Rust-y <a href="https://docs.rs/nix" rel="nofollow"><code>nix</code></a>/<a href="https://docs.rs/rustix" rel="nofollow"><code>rustix</code></a>-inspired "North" interface when it is provided a <code>Platform</code> interface at its "South".  These interfaces allow for a wide variety of use-cases, easily allowing for connection between any of the North--South pairs.</p>
<p dir="auto">Example use cases include:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Running unmodified Linux programs on Windows</li>
<li>Sandboxing Linux applications on Linux</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
            <p>I’ve been going round and round in my mind about a particular discussion around LLMs: are they really similar to compilers? Are we headed toward a world where people don’t look at the underlying code for their programs?</p>
<p>People have been making versions of this argument since Andrej Karpathy’s “English is the hottest new programming language.” Computer science has been advancing language design by building higher and higher level languages; this is the latest iteration: maybe we no longer need a separate language to express ourselves to machines; we can just use our native tongues (let alone English).</p>
<p>My stance has been pretty rigid for some time: LLMs hallucinate, so they aren’t reliable building blocks. If you can’t rely on the translation step, you can’t treat it as a serious abstraction layer because it provides no stable guarantees about the underlying system.</p>
<p>As models get better, hallucinations become less central (even though models still make plenty of mistakes). Lately I’ve been thinking about a different question: imagine an LLM that never “hallucinates” in the usual sense, one that reliably produces some plausible implementation of what you asked. Would that make it the next generation of compiler? And what would that mean for programming and software engineering in general?</p>
<p>This post is my stab at that question. The core of my argument is simple:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifying systems is <em>hard</em>; and we are <em>lazy</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before getting to what that means in practice, I want to pin down something else: what does it mean for a language to be “higher level”?</p>
<p>Programming is, at a fundamental level, the act of making a computer do something. Computers
are very dumb from the point of view of a human. You need to tell the computer exactly what to do,
there's no inference. A computer fundamentally doesn't even have the notion of a value, type, concept; everything
is a series of bits, which are processed to generate other bits, we bring meaning to this whole ordeal.
Very early on, people have started by building arithmetic and logical instructions into computers,
you would have 2 different bit sequences each denoting a number, you could add, subtract, multiply them.
In order to make a computer do something, you could denote your data in terms of a bunch of numbers, map
your logical operations onto those ALU instructions, and interpret the result in your domain at the end.
Then, you can define a bunch of operations on your domain, which will be compiled down to those smaller ALU
instructions, and <em>voila</em>, you have a compiler at hand.</p>
<p>This compiler is, admittedly, kind of redundant. It doesn't do anything you would be able to do because you
essentially have a direct mapping between your two <em>languages</em>, your higher level language desugars into a
bunch of lower level ALU instructions, so anyone would be able to implement the same mapping very easily,
and even go further, perhaps just write the ALU instructions themselves.</p>
<p>What <em>real</em> higher level languages do is they give you an entirely new language that is eventually mapped
to the underlying instruction set in non-trivial mechanisms in order to reduce the mental complexity
on the side of the programmer. For instance, instruction sets do not have the concept of variables,
nor loops, nor data structures. You can definitely build a sequence of instructions that amount to a binary
search tree, but the mental burden of the process is orders of magnitude higher than any classic programming
language. Structs, Enums, Classes, Loops, Conditionals, Exceptions, Variables, Functions are all properties
that exist in higher level languages that are compiled away when going down the stack.</p>
<p>There's a crucial aspect of compilation, which is that the programmer gives away some control, that's essentially
what removes the mental burden. If a programming language doesn't give away any control, it arguably isn't a very
useful abstraction layer, because it did not absolve you of any responsibility that comes with that control. One
of the first examples of this type of control we gave away is code layout. If you are writing handwritten assembly, you control where the code lives in the program memory. When you go into a language with structured control flow with callable procedures,
you now don't have exact control over when the instructions for a particular piece of code is fetched, how basic
blocks are arranged in the memory. Other examples are more common, the <em>runtime</em> of a language works in the background
to absolve you of other responsibilities such as manual memory management, which itself was an abstraction
for automatically managing how your data is organized in memory in the first place.</p>
<p>This loss of control raises a question: how do we know the abstraction is implemented correctly? More importantly, <strong>what does it mean for an abstraction to be correct?</strong></p>
<p>There are a few layers to the answer. First, mature abstractions are defined against some semantics: what behaviors are allowed, what behaviors are forbidden, and what guarantees you’re meant to rely on. In C, <code>malloc</code> gives you a pointer to a block of memory of at least the requested size (or <code>NULL</code>), suitably aligned, which you may later <code>free</code>. It doesn’t give you “exclusive ownership” in the language-theoretic sense, but it does define a contract you can program against.</p>
<p>Second, we validate implementations with testing (and sometimes proofs), because these guarantees are at least in principle checkable. Third, in practice, guarantees are contextual: most programs care that allocation works; only some care deeply about allocator performance, fragmentation behavior, or contention, those are the cases where people swap allocators or drop down a level.</p>
<p>This highlights a critical point: abstraction guarantees aren’t uniform; they’re contextual. Most of the time, that contextuality is dominated by functional correctness: “does it do what it says?” Programming languages made enormous progress by giving us abstractions whose functional behavior can be specified precisely and tested relentlessly. We can act as if push/pop on a Python list has the same
semantics as a vector in C++ even when the underlying implementation differs wildly across languages and runtimes.</p>
<p>LLM-based programming challenges this domination because the “language” (natural language) doesn’t come with precise semantics. That makes it much harder to even state what functional correctness should mean without building a validation/verification suite around it (tests, types, contracts, formal specs).</p>
<p>This gets to my core point. What changes with LLMs isn’t primarily nondeterminism, unpredictability, or hallucination. It’s that the programming interface is functionally underspecified by default. Natural language leaves gaps; many distinct programs can satisfy the same prompt. The LLM must fill those gaps.</p>
<p>Just as a garbage-collected runtime takes control over how and when memory is reclaimed, “programming in English” relinquishes control over which exact program gets built to fulfill your requirements. The underspecification forces the model to guess the data model, edge cases, error behavior, security posture, performance tradeoffs in your program, analogous to how an allocator chooses an allocation strategy.</p>
<p><strong>This creates quite a novel danger in how we write programs.</strong></p>
<p>Humans have always written vague requirements; that part isn’t new. What’s new is how directly an LLM can turn vagueness into running code, inviting us to outsource functional precision itself. We can leave meaningful behavioral choices to a generator and only react to the outcome.</p>
<p>If you say “give me a note-taking app,” you’re not describing one program, you’re describing a huge space of programs. The LLM can return one of a billion “reasonable” implementations: something Notion-like, Evernote-like, Apple Notes-like, or something novel. The danger is that “reasonable” choices can still be wrong for your intent, and you won’t notice which commitments got made until later.</p>
<p>This pushes development toward an iterative refinement loop: write an imprecise spec, get one of the possible implementations, inspect it, refine the spec, repeat until you’re satisfied. In this mode, you become more like a consumer selecting from generated artifacts than a producer deliberately constructing one.</p>
<p>And you also lose something subtle: when you hand-build, the “space of possibilities” is explored through design decisions you’re forced to confront. With a magic genie, those decisions get made for you; you only see the surface of what you ended up with.</p>
<p>I don’t think this point is widely internalized yet: hallucinations aren’t the only problem. Even in a hallucination-free world, the ability to take the easy way out on specification plays into a dangerously lazy part of the mind. You can see it in the semi-conscious slips (I’m guilty too): accept-all-edits, “one more prompt and it’ll be fine,” and slow drifting into software you don’t really understand.</p>
<p>That’s why I think the will to specify is going to become increasingly important. We already see LLMs shine when they’re given concrete constraints: optimization, refactors, translations, migrations, tasks that used to be so labor-intensive we’d laugh at the timeline, become feasible when the target behavior is well specified and backed by robust test suites.</p>
<p>It’s been true for a long time that specifying a piece of software is often harder than building it. But we may be entering a world where: if you can specify, you can build. If that’s right, then <a href="https://alperenkeles.com/posts/verifiability-is-the-limit/">specification and verification become the bottleneck</a>, and therefore the core skill.</p>
<p>This isn’t my most polished post, but I wanted to get the idea out. I do think it’s possible to treat LLMs as compiler-like, in the loose sense that they translate a specification into an executable artifact. But the control we relinquish to that translation layer is larger than it has ever been.</p>
<p>Traditional compilers reduce the need to stare at lower layers by replacing low-level control with defined semantics and testable guarantees. LLMs also reduce the need to read source code in many contexts, but the control you lose isn’t naturally bounded by a formal language definition. You can lose control all the way into becoming a consumer of software you meant to produce, and it’s frighteningly easy to accept that drift without noticing.</p>
<p>So: I don’t think we should fully accept the compiler analogy without qualification. As LLMs become a central toolchain component, we’ll need ways to strengthen the will to specify, and to make specification and verification feel as “normal” as writing code used to.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			<p>In 2024, Apple signed a deal with Taboola to serve ads in its app, notably Apple News. John Gruber, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/07/apple_taboola_sitting_in_a_tree">writing in Daring Fireball</a> said at the time:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  If you told me that the ads in Apple News have been sold by Taboola for the last few years, I’d have said, “Oh, that makes sense.” Because the ads in Apple News — at least the ones I see1 — already look like chumbox Taboola ads. Even worse, they’re incredibly repetitious.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I use Apple News to keep up on topics that I don’t find in sources I pay for (The Guardian and The New York Times). But there’s no way I’m going to pay the exorbitant price Apple wants for Apple News+ – £13 – because, while you get more publications, you still get ads.</p>
<p>And those ads have gotten worse recently. Many if not most of them look like and probably are scams. Here are a few examples from Apple News today.</p>

<p>Here are three ads that are scammy; the first two were clearly generated by AI, and the third may have been created by AI.</p>

<p>This recent registration doesn’t necessarily mean they are scams, but they don’t inspire much confidence.</p>
<p>Here’s one example. This ad from Tidenox, whose website says I am retiring, showing a photo of an elderly woman, who says, “For 26 years, Tidenox has been port of your journey in creating earth and comfort at home.” The image of the retiring owner is probably made by AI.</p>

<p>These fake “going out of business ads” have been around for a few years, and even <a href="https://www.bbb.org/all/consumer/scam/fake-going-out-of-business-sales">the US Better Business Bureau warns about them</a>, as they take peoples’ money then shut down. Does Apple care? Does Taboola care? Does Apple care that Taboola serves ads like this? My guess: no, no, and no.</p>
<p>Note the registration date for the tidenox.com domain. It’s nowhere near 26 years old, and it’s registered in China:</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p data-block-key="t18jd">The power of artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced computing has made it possible to design genetic sequences encoding for diverse biological applications, such as proteins that form the building blocks of materials stronger than steel, or personalized cancer treatments. But the act of constructing DNA sequences to realize those designs has been a significant bottleneck. Due to technological limitations, chemical DNA synthesis has been limited only to creating short pieces of DNA. However, DNA molecules on the scale of genes or genomes can be tens to thousands of times longer than current capabilities allow. Without DNA construction, AI-powered biological designs cannot be verified or improved—meaning that the blueprints for futuristic new technologies cannot be realized.</p><p data-block-key="cvvii">Caltech researchers have invented a new technology to write long sequences of DNA with groundbreaking accuracy. The invention, a method called Sidewinder, utilizes the conceptual equivalent of page numbers for DNA, enabling researchers to stitch together any arbitrary number of short pieces of DNA, called synthetic oligonucleotides, or "oligos," in the correct order to create a much larger piece of DNA—up to the scale of a gene or potentially an entire genome (the entire genetic complement of an organism). Synthetic oligos, which are cheap and widely available, can now be combined into any design using Sidewinder. This innovation clears a major bottleneck for bioengineering new compounds and materials, and it could have a vast array of applications, including agriculture and therapeutics.</p><p data-block-key="32tc6">The invention and development of Sidewinder was conducted in the laboratory of <a href="https://www.bbe.caltech.edu/people/kaihang-wang">Kaihang Wang</a>, an assistant professor of biology and biological engineering. A paper describing the technique appears in the journal <i>Nature</i> on January 21.</p><p data-block-key="2h47k">"DNA is the source code of all earthly life and biological functions," Wang says. "As such, biomedical applications and the future bioeconomy depend on the ability to write DNA. Sidewinder provides a new path to the ancient and persisting desire of humankind to rewrite the very source code of life. We can now make long DNA, regardless of complexity and sequence, and do this faster, more easily, and more cheaply than has been possible."</p><p data-block-key="fm9o8">The diversity of life forms on Earth comes from evolution: As organisms replicate, their DNA is copied into their offspring. Over millions of years, mutations accumulate, giving rise to new organisms with new functions. However, this means that in nature, entirely new DNA sequences are never written from scratch—they are only iteratively copied and edited from a pre-existing template.</p><p data-block-key="5umi8">Humans have taken advantage of the evolutionary process for millennia; for example, over the course of about 9,000 years, humanity domesticated and selectively bred maize. With the advent of modern biology, researchers began to explore the possibility of synthesizing new DNA sequences from scratch for the first time in human history.</p><p data-block-key="5brfq">In the 1970s, researchers developed the ability to synthesize short pieces of DNA—the aforementioned oligos. These pieces are around 10 to 100 base pairs long. However, attempts to accurately synthesize oligos longer than a few hundred nucleotides were not successful. Genes that encode for many useful proteins are on the order of thousands to tens of thousands of nucleotides, far too long for current synthesizing methods.</p><p data-block-key="dsilt">In the past four decades, short synthetic oligos have been produced at scale to enable biotech advances, such as the recent messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines targeting COVID-19. But in order to create entire genes, and thus enable biotechnologies such as personalized cancer vaccines, these short oligos would need to be stitched together with perfect accuracy into longer, complex DNA sequences.</p><p data-block-key="1vtig">Enter Kaihang Wang's Sidewinder. With Sidewinder, synthetic biologists can write new genes and entire genomes within just a few days, if not hours.</p><p data-block-key="2f9tf">To explain Sidewinder's mechanism, Kaihang uses the analogy of assembling printed pages into books in the West. "In 1441, Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press, enabling the creation of individual printed pages," he says. "But Gutenberg's bibles never contained any page numbers. These books were painstakingly assembled by aligning the contexts at the beginning and end of each page, for hundreds of pages. Thus, the eventual invention of page numbers, which took about 50 years, was revolutionary. The seemingly simple concept of page numbers was actually non-trivial. We are fortunate to learn from this history, because we are facing a surprisingly identical challenge: how to guide the construction of long sequences from individually synthesized pieces. In this case, they are DNA oligos instead of printed pages. It has been 40 years since the invention of oligo synthesis, the equivalent of a Gutenberg press for DNA, and now it is high time that we invent the equivalent of 'DNA page numbers' to guide the assembly of these short oligos to construct long and functional DNA—the equivalent of books—for genes, gene clusters, and all the way to genomes to complete the book of life."</p><p data-block-key="2hu53">The Sidewinder process attaches DNA "page numbers" to each oligo, enabling each piece to match up with the right neighbors in the sequence—piece number 4, for example, follows piece number 3 and precedes piece number 5. It works by using a technique called a 3 Way Junction (3WJ), which causes the page number pieces to stick out of the side of the assembled DNA construct like little tags. In this way, the information guiding the construction of the DNA sequence can be separated from the information encoded in the DNA sequence. These little tags extending from the 3WJ are then smoothly removed, resulting in a perfectly assembled, uninterrupted DNA double helix for any desired applications. The ability to remove the third helices from the 3WJs in a single, seamless step after using them as "page numbers" to guide the DNA construction is a critical part of the Sidewinder invention. Guided by the removable DNA page numbers, Sidewinder achieves an incredibly high fidelity in DNA construction with a measured misconnection rate of just one in one million, a four to five magnitude improvement over all prior techniques whose misconnection rates range from 1-in-10 to 1-in-30.</p><p data-block-key="85or5">"Sidewinder is wonderfully creative, and a powerful step toward the goal of writing DNA of any complexity," says Caltech's <a href="https://cce.caltech.edu/people/frances-h-arnold?back_url=%2Fpeople">Frances Arnold</a>, the Linus Pauling Professor of Chemical Engineering, Bioengineering and Biochemistry, director of the Donna and Benjamin M. Rosen Bioengineering Center, and winner of the <a href="https://www.caltech.edu/about/news">2018 Nobel Prize in Chemistry</a>. Arnold invented a method called directed evolution—a technology to mimic natural selection in the laboratory—and is now using&nbsp;AI to facilitate protein design.&nbsp;"Sidewinder addresses a key bottleneck in translating computational design into reality, with applications across health and sustainability."</p><p data-block-key="d4ua8">"A cell is a complex computer, one we want to be able to engineer for our own applications," says the study's first author, Noah Robinson (PhD '25), who completed his graduate studies in Kaihang Wang's laboratory and is now continuing the work as a postdoctoral scholar. "To do that, we need to be able to design and construct in the language of life, DNA. With Sidewinder, our lab is developing tools to make this a reality."</p><p data-block-key="o37j">The team now plans to address additional bottlenecks in scaling up construction of sequences. Additionally, Kaihang emphasizes the importance of interfacing Sidewinder with AI.</p><p data-block-key="3dkrp">"Interfacing with AI will give us the freedom both to design and to construct," Kaihang says. "Whatever can be designed by AI as a biological function can be constructed through Sidewinder. The convergence of design through AI and construction through next-generation DNA writing technologies such as Sidewinder may enable an alternative to how life can come around, in addition to evolution. Now maybe it can be designed and made."</p><p data-block-key="8rgfo">A paper describing the research is titled <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-10006-0">"Construction of complex and diverse DNA sequences using DNA 3-Way Junctions."</a> In addition to Robinson and Wang, Caltech co-authors are graduate students Weilin Zhang, Bryan Gerber, Hanqiao Zhang, and Sixiang Wang; and research scientist Charles Sanfiorenzo (PhD '24). Additional co-authors are Rajesh Ghosh and Dino Di Carlo of UCLA. Funding was provided by the National Science Foundation, the Shurl and Kay Curci Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, and Caltech's Center for Environmental Microbial Interactions. Genyro, a biotechnology company&nbsp;co-founded by Kaihang Wang, has entered into an exclusive licensing&nbsp;agreement for Sidewinder to advance next-generation DNA construction.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2026/02/a-new-bill-in-new-york-would-require-disclaimers-on-ai-generated-news-content/">https://www.niemanlab.org/2026/02/a-new-bill-in-new-york-would-require-disclaimers-on-ai-generated-news-content/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46910963">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new bill in the New York state legislature would require news organizations to label AI-generated material and mandate that humans review any such content before publication. On Monday, Senator Patricia Fahy (D-Albany) and Assemblymember Nily Rozic (D-NYC) <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/A8962/amendment/A">introduced the bill</a>, called The New York Fundamental Artificial Intelligence Requirements in News Act — The NY FAIR News Act for short.</p>
<p>“At the center of the news industry, New York has a strong interest in preserving journalism and protecting the workers who produce it,” said Rozic in a <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2026/patricia-fahy/fahy-rozic-introduce-ny-fair-news-act-protect">statement announcing the bill</a>.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://legislation.nysenate.gov/pdf/bills/2025/S8451">closer look at the bill</a> shows a few regulations, mostly centered around AI transparency, both for the public and in the newsroom. For one, the law would demand that news organizations put disclaimers on any published content that is “substantially composed, authored, or created through the use of generative artificial intelligence.”</p>
<p>AI disclaimers for readers have been hotly <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2023/12/most-readers-want-publishers-to-label-ai-generated-articles-but-trust-outlets-less-when-they-do/">debated in the news industry</a>, with some critics arguing that such labels alienate audiences, even when generative AI is only used as an assistive tool. The bill contains a carve-out that would allow copyrightable material to be excluded from the law. (The <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/newsnet/2025/1060.html">U.S. Copyright Office has ruled</a> that works solely generated by AI systems are not eligible for copyright, but allows leeway for works that show signs of “human authorship.”)</p>
<p>The bill also requires that news organizations disclose to journalists and other media professionals in their newsrooms when AI is being used and how. Any news content created using generative AI must also be reviewed by a human employee “with editorial control” before publication. That goes not just for news articles but also for audio, images, and other visuals.</p>
<p>In addition, the bill contains language that requires news organizations to create safeguards that protect confidential material — mainly, information about sources — from being accessed by AI technologies.</p>
<p>State lawmakers highlighted two main reasons for proposing the NY FAIR News Act. First, they say, AI-generated content may be “false or misleading.” Second, they argue, AI-generated content “plagiarizes” by deriving content from original sources “without permission or proper citation.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps one of the industries at most risk from the use of artificial intelligence is journalism and as a result, the public’s trust and confidence in accurate news reporting,” said Sen. Fahy in a statement. “More than 76% of Americans are concerned about AI stealing or reproducing journalism and local news stories.”</p>
<p>The proposed bill was announced with broad endorsements from unions across the news industry, including WGA-East, SAG-AFTRA and the DGA.</p>
<p>Jennifer Sheehan, a spokesperson for the NewsGuild of New York, confirmed that the NewsGuild has been meeting with this labor coalition to discuss shared concerns around AI adoption and working to get the bill off the ground.</p>
<p>Notably, the bill would cement some labor protections for newsroom workers — including restrictions on firing journalists or reducing their work, pay, or benefits due to generative AI adoption. Similar language has been negotiated into individual newsroom union contracts across the country over the past couple of years.</p>
<p>In December, the NewsGuild launched a nationwide campaign called “<a href="https://www.newsnotslop.org/">News Not Slop</a>” to advocate for more guardrails on AI usage in newsrooms. In New York City, the Business Insider union held a rally in the Financial District to protest an editorial pilot that was publishing <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-pilot">AI-generated news stories</a> with an “AI byline.”</p>
<p>“Our union is deeply concerned about media companies implementing artificial intelligence in ways that damage the credibility of our members’ journalism,” Sheehan said, “as well as the impact such technology has had and will have on jobs.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<h2><a href="https://rcrowley.org/2010/01/06/things-unix-can-do-atomically.html">Things UNIX can do atomically</a> <small>2010/01/06</small></h2>
<p>This is a catalog of things UNIX-like/POSIX-compliant operating systems can do atomically, making them useful as building blocks for thread-safe and multi-process-safe programs without mutexes or read/write locks.&nbsp; The list is by no means exhaustive and I expect it to be updated frequently for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>The philosophy here is to let the kernel do as much work as possible.&nbsp; At my most pessimistic, I trust the kernel developers more than a trust myself.&nbsp; More practically, it’s stupid to spend CPU time locking around an operation that’s already atomic.&nbsp; <em>Added 2010-01-07.</em></p>

<h2>Operating on a pathname</h2>

<p>The operations below are best left to local filesystems.&nbsp; More than a few people have written in crying foul if any of these techniques are used on an NFS mount.&nbsp; True.&nbsp; When there are multiple kernels involved, the kernel can’t very well take care of all the locking for us.&nbsp; <em>Added 2010-01-06.</em></p>

<ul>
	<li id="mv"><code>mv -T &lt;oldsymlink&gt; &lt;newsymlink&gt;</code> atomically changes the target of <code>&lt;newsymlink&gt;</code> to the directory pointed to by <code>&lt;oldsymlink&gt;</code> and is indispensable when deploying new code.&nbsp; <em>Updated 2010-01-06: both operands are symlinks.</em>&nbsp; (So this isn’t a system call, it’s still useful.)&nbsp; <del>A reader pointed out that <code>ln -Tfs &lt;directory&gt; &lt;symlink&gt;</code> accomplishes the same thing without the second symlink.&nbsp; <em>Added 2010-01-06.</em></del>&nbsp; <em>Deleted 2010-01-06: <code>strace(1)</code> shows that <code>ln -Tfs &lt;directory&gt; &lt;symlink&gt;</code> actually calls <code>symlink(2)</code>, <code>unlink(2)</code>, and <code>symlink(2)</code> once more, disqualifying it from this page.&nbsp; <code>mv -T &lt;oldsymlink&gt; &lt;newsymlink&gt;</code> ends up calling <code>rename(2)</code> which can atomically replace <code>&lt;newsymlink&gt;</code>.</em>&nbsp; <em>Caveat 2013-01-07: this does not apply to Mac OS X, whose <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Darwin/Reference/Manpages/man1/mv.1.html"><code>mv(1)</code></a> doesn’t call <code>rename(2)</code>.</em>&nbsp; <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/mv"><code>mv(1)</code></a>.</li>
	<li id="link"><code>link(oldpath, newpath)</code> creates a new hard link called <code>newpath</code> pointing to the same inode as <code>oldpath</code> and increases the link count by one.&nbsp; This will fail with the error code <code>EEXIST</code> if <code>newpath</code> already exists, making this a useful mechanism for locking a file amongst threads or processes that can all agree upon the name <code>newpath</code>.&nbsp; I prefer this technique for whole-file locking because the lock is visible to <code>ls(1)</code>.&nbsp; <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/2/link"><code>link(2)</code></a>.</li>
	<li id="symlink"><code>symlink(oldpath, newpath)</code> operates very much like <code>link(2)</code> but creates a symbolic link at a new inode rather than a hard link to the same inode.&nbsp; Symbolic links can point to directories, which hard links cannot, making them a perfect analogy to <code>link(2)</code> when locking entire directories.&nbsp; This will fail with the error code <code>EEXIST</code> if <code>newpath</code> already exists, making this a perfect analogy to <code>link(2)</code> that works for directories, too.&nbsp; Be careful of symbolic links whose target inode has been removed ("dangling" symbolic links) — <code>open(2)</code> will fail with the error code <code>ENOENT</code>.&nbsp; It should be mentioned that inodes are a finite resource (this particular machine has 1,245,184 inodes).&nbsp; <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/2/symlink"><code>symlink(2)</code></a>.&nbsp; <em>Added 2010-01-07</em></li>
	<li id="rename"><code>rename(oldpath, newpath)</code> can change a pathname atomically, provided <code>oldpath</code> and <code>newpath</code> are on the same filesystem.&nbsp; This will fail with the error code <code>ENOENT</code> if <code>oldpath</code> does not exist, enabling interprocess locking much like <code>link(oldpath, newpath)</code> above.&nbsp; I find this technique more natural when the files in question will be <code>unlink</code>ed later.&nbsp; <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/2/rename"><code>rename(2)</code></a>.</li>
	<li id="open"><code>open(pathname, O_CREAT | O_EXCL, 0644)</code> creates and opens a new file.&nbsp; (Don’t forget to set the mode in the third argument!)&nbsp; <code>O_EXCL</code> instructs this to fail with the error code <code>EEXIST</code> if <code>pathname</code> exists.&nbsp; This is a useful way to decide which process should handle a task: whoever successfully creates the file.&nbsp; <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/2/open"><code>open(2)</code></a>.</li>
	<li id="mkdir"><code>mkdir(dirname, 0755)</code> creates a new directory but fails with the error code <code>EEXIST</code> if <code>dirname</code> exists.&nbsp; This provides for directories the same mechanism <del><code>link(2)</code></del> <code>open(2)</code> with <code>O_EXCL</code> provides for files.&nbsp; <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/2/mkdir"><code>mkdir(2)</code></a>.&nbsp; <em>Added 2010-01-06; edited 2013-01-07.</em></li>
</ul>

<h2>Operating on a file descriptor</h2>

<ul>
	<li id="fcntl-lock"><code>fcntl(fd, F_GETLK, &amp;lock)</code>, <code>fcntl(fd, F_SETLK, &amp;lock)</code>, and <code>fcntl(fd, F_SETLKW, &amp;lock)</code> allow cooperating processes to lock regions of a file to serialize their access.&nbsp; <code>lock</code> is of type <code>struct flock</code> and describes the type of lock and the region being locked.&nbsp; <code>F_SETLKW</code> is particularly useful as it blocks the calling process until the lock is acquired.&nbsp; There is a “mandatory locking” mode but Linux’s implementation is unreliable as it’s subject to a race condition.&nbsp; <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/2/fcntl"><code>fcntl(2)</code></a>.</li>
	<li id="fcntl-lease"><code>fcntl(fd, F_GETLEASE)</code> and <code>fcntl(fd, F_SETLEASE, lease)</code> ask the kernel to notify the calling process with <code>SIGIO</code> when another process <code>open</code>s or <code>truncate</code>s the file referred to by <code>fd</code>.&nbsp; When that signals arrives, the lease needs to be removed by <code>fcntl(fd, F_SETLEASE, F_UNLCK)</code>.&nbsp; <code>fcntl(fd, F_NOTIFY, arg)</code> is similar but doesn’t block other processes, so it isn’t useful for synchronization.&nbsp; <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/2/fcntl"><code>fcntl(2)</code></a>.</li>
	<li id="mmap"><code>mmap(0, length, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, fd, 0)</code> returns a pointer from which a file’s contents can be read and written by normal memory operations.&nbsp; By making frequent use of <code>msync(addr, length, MS_INVALIDATE)</code>, data written in this manner can be shared between processes that both map the same file.&nbsp; <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/2/mmap"><code>mmap(2)</code></a>, <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/2/msync"><code>msync(2)</code></a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Operating on virtual memory</h2>

<ul>
	<li id="gcc-atomic-builtins"><code>__sync_fetch_and_add</code>, <code>__sync_add_and_fetch</code>, <code>__sync_val_compare_and_swap</code>, and friends provide a full barrier so “no memory operand will be moved across the operation, either forward or backward.” These operations are the basis for most (all?) lock-free algorithms.&nbsp; <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.1.2/gcc/Atomic-Builtins.html">GCC Atomic Builtins</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Something I should add to my repertoire?&nbsp; Race condition?&nbsp; Let me know at <a href="mailto:r@rcrowley.org">r@rcrowley.org</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/rcrowley">@rcrowley</a> and I’ll fix it.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-6220633398737666659" itemprop="description articleBody"><p>
There are two main schools of thought in software development about how to build really big, complicated stuff.</p><p>The most prevalent one, these days, is that you gradually evolve the complexity over time. You start small and keep adding to it. </p><p>The other school is that you lay out a huge specification that would fully work through all of the complexity in advance, then build it.</p><p>In a sense, it is the difference between the way an entrepreneur might approach doing a startup versus how we build modern skyscrapers. Evolution versus Engineering.</p><p>I was working in a large company a while ago, and I stumbled on the fact that they had well over 3000 active systems that were covering dozens of lines of business and all of the internal departments. It had evolved this way over fifty years, and included lots of different tech stacks, as well as countless vendors. Viewed as ‘one’ thing it was a pretty shaky house of cards.</p><p>It’s not hard to see that if they had a few really big systems, then a great number of their problems would disappear. The inconsistencies between data, security, operations, quality, and access were huge across all of those disconnected projects. Some systems were up-to-date, some were ancient. Some worked well, some were barely functional. With way fewer systems, a lot of these self-inflicted problems would just go away.</p><p>It’s not that you could cut the combined complexity in half, but more likely that you could bring it down to at least one-tenth of what it is today, if not even better. It would function better, be more reliable, and would be far more resilient to change. It would likely cost far less and require fewer employees as well. All sorts of ugly problems that they have now would just not exist.</p><p>The core difference between the different schools really centers around how to deal with dependencies. </p><p>If you had thousands of little blobs of complexity that were all entirely independent, then getting finished is just a matter of banging out each one by itself until they are all completed. That’s the dream. </p><p>But in practice, very few things in a big ecosystem are actually independent. That’s the problem.</p><p>If you are going to evolve a system, then you ignore these dependencies. Sort them out afterwards, as the complexity grows. It’s faster, and you can get started right away.</p><p>If you were going to design a big system, then these dependencies dictate that design. You have to go through each one and understand them all right away. They change everything from the architecture all the way down to the idioms and style in the code. </p><p>But that means that all of the people working to build up this big system have to interact with each other. Coordinate and communicate. That is a lot of friction that management and the programmers don’t want. They tend to feel like it would all get done faster if they could just go off on their own. And it will, in the short-term.</p><p>If you ignore a dependency and try to fix it later, it will be more expensive. More time, more effort, more thinking. And it will require the same level of coordination that you tried to avoid initially. Slightly worse, in that the time pressures of doing it correctly generally give way to just getting it done quickly, which pumps up the overall artificial complexity. The more hacks you throw at it, the more hacks you will need to hold it together. It spirals out of control. You lose big in the long-term.</p><p>One of the big speed bumps preventing big up-front designs is a general lack of knowledge. Since the foundations like tech stacks, frameworks, and libraries are always changing rapidly these days, there are few accepted best practices, and most issues are incorrectly believed to be subjective. They’re not, of course, but it takes a lot of repeated experience to see that. </p><p>The career path of most application programmers is fairly short. In most enterprises, the majority have five years or less of real in-depth experience, and battle-scared twenty-year+ vets are rare. Mostly, these novices are struggling through early career experiences, not ready yet to deal with the unbounded, massive complexity present in a big design. </p><p>Also, the other side of it is that evolutionary projects are just more fun. I’ve preferred them. You’re not loaded down with all those messy dependencies. Way fewer meetings, so you can just get into the work and see how it goes. Endlessly arguing about fiddly details in a giant spec is draining, made worse if the experience around you is weak. </p><p>Evolutionary projects go very badly sometimes. The larger they grow, the more likely they will derail. And the fun gives way to really bad stress. That severe last-minute panic that comes from knowing that the code doesn't really work as it should, and probably never will. And the longer-term dissatisfaction of having done all that work to ultimately just contribute to the problem, not actually fix it.</p><p>Big up-front designs are often better from a stress perspective. A little slow to start and sometimes slow in the middle, they mostly smooth out the overall development process. You’ve got a lot of work to do, but you’ve also got enough time to do it correctly. So you grind through it, piece by piece, being as attentive to the details as possible. Along the way, you actively look for smarter approaches to compress the work. Reuse, for instance, can shave a ton of code off the table, cut down on testing, and provide stronger certainty that the code will do the right thing in production. </p><p>The fear that big projects will end up producing the wrong thing is often overstated. It’s true for a startup, but entirely untrue for some large business application for a market that’s been around forever. You don’t need to burn a lot of extra time, breaking the work up into tiny fragments, unless you really don’t have a clue what you are building. If you're replacing some other existing system, not only do you have a clue, you usually have a really solid long-term roadmap. Replace the original work and fix its deficiencies.  </p><p>There should be some balanced path in the middle somewhere, but I haven’t stumbled across a formal version of it after all these decades. </p><p>We could go first to the dependencies, then come up with reasons why they can be temporarily ignored. You can evolve the next release, but still have a vague big design as a long-term plan. You can refactor the design as you come across new, unexpected dependencies. Change your mind, over and over again, to try to get the evolved works to converge on a solid grand design. Start fast, slow right down, speed up, slow down again, and so forth. The goal is one big giant system to rule them all, but it may just take a while to get there. </p><p>The other point is that the size of the iterations matters, a whole lot. If they are tiny, it is because you are blindly stumbling forward. If you are not blindly stumbling forward, they should be longer, as it is more effective. They don’t have to all be the same size. And you really should stop and take stock after each iteration. The faster people code, the more cleanup that is required. The longer you avoid cleaning it up, the worse it gets, on basically an exponential scale. If you run forward like crazy and never stop, the working environment will be such a swamp that it will all grind to an abrupt stop. This is true in building anything, or even cooking in a restaurant. Speed is a tradeoff.</p><p>Evolution is the way to avoid getting bogged down in engineering, but engineering is the way to ensure that the thing you build really does what it is supposed to do. Engineering is slow, but spinning way out of control is a heck of a lot slower. Evolution is obviously more dynamic, but it is also more chaotic, and you have to continually accept that you’ve gone down a bad path and need to backtrack. That is hard to admit sometimes. For most systems, there are parts that really need to be engineered, and parts that can just be allowed to evolve. The more random the evolutionary path, the more stuff you need to throw away and redo. Wobbling is always expensive. Nature gets away with this by having millions of species, but we really only have one development project, so it isn’t particularly convenient.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>   <p>I was an early employee at CircleCI. I have used, in anger, nearly every CI system that has ever existed. Jenkins, Travis, CircleCI, Semaphore, Drone, Concourse, Wercker (remember Wercker?), TeamCity, Bamboo, GitLab CI, CodeBuild, and probably a half dozen others I’ve mercifully forgotten. I have mass-tested these systems so that you don’t have to, and I have the scars to show for it, and I am here to tell you: GitHub Actions is not good. It’s not even fine. It has market share because it’s <em>right there</em> in your repo, and that’s about the nicest thing I can say about it.</p>
<p>Buildkite is what CI should feel like. But first, let me tell you what CI should <em>not</em> feel like.</p>
<h2 id="if-youre-a-nix-shop-you-can-leave-early">If You’re a Nix Shop, You Can Leave Early</h2>
<p>Before I get into it: if you’re a Nix shop, take a look at <a href="https://garnix.io/">Garnix</a>. It evaluates your flake, figures out what needs building, and builds it. No YAML. No pipeline configuration. It just looks at your <code>flake.nix</code> and does the right thing. Sometimes the best CI configuration is no CI configuration.</p>
<p>Most shops are not Nix shops. This post is for the rest of you. I’m sorry.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="part-i-the-descent">Part I: The Descent</h2>
<h2 id="the-log-viewer-or-where-your-afternoon-goes-to-die">The Log Viewer, or: Where Your Afternoon Goes to Die</h2>
<p>Let me start with the most visceral thing, the thing that will sound like I’m exaggerating but I am not.</p>
<p>Your build fails. You get a red X on your pull request. You click through to see what happened. This is where the ordeal begins.</p>
<p>First you land on the checks summary page, which shows you a list of workflow runs. Maybe one failed. Maybe three failed. You click the one that looks relevant. Now you’re on the workflow run page, which shows you a list of jobs. You click the failed job. Now you’re on the job page, which shows you a list of steps, all collapsed. You click the step that failed. The page hitches. You scroll. There is a pause, a held breath, and then the logs appear, slowly, like a manuscript being revealed one line at a time to a supplicant who has not yet proven worthy.</p>
<p>That’s three or four clicks just to see the error, and every one of them loads a new page with its own loading spinner, and none of them are fast. You are navigating a bureaucracy. You are filling out forms at the DMV of CI.</p>
<p>And then the log viewer itself. I have used every CI system known to man, and the GitHub Actions log viewer is the only one that has <em>crashed my browser</em>. Not once. Repeatedly. Reliably. Open a long build log, try to search for an error, and Chrome will look you in the eye and die. This is the log viewer for the most popular CI system in the world. This is the tool you are expected to use to understand why your build failed. It cannot survive contact with its own output.</p>
<p>With large logs (and if you have a real build system, you have large logs) you often can’t even scroll to the bottom. The page just gives up. The scrollbar is there, technically, but it’s decorative. It’s a suggestion. You drag it down and the page chokes and stutters and eventually you realize you’re not going to get there this way. So you download the raw log artifact and open it in a text editor like it’s 2003 and you’re reading Apache access logs on a shared hosting box. Except it’s 2025 and this is a product made by one of the richest companies on earth.</p>
<p>And when you’re done, when you’ve finally found the error, processed your grief, and want to go back to the pull request that started this whole ordeal, you hit the back button. Does it take you to the PR? No. It takes you to some other page in the GitHub Actions UI. A summary page, maybe. Or a different run. Or a page you don’t recognize. The back button in the GitHub Actions UI is a roulette wheel. You will land somewhere. It will not be where you wanted to go. You will click the back button again. You will land somewhere else. Eventually you give up and type the PR URL from memory or go find it in your browser history, which is now 80% GitHub Actions URLs, a fact that will haunt you when you look at it later.</p>
<p>So the logs have betrayed you, or perhaps they simply could not be made to appear at all. Now begins the second ritual: the debugging.</p>
<p>You push a commit. You wait. A runner picks it up. You watch logs scroll. Something fails. The error looks like someone fed a stack trace through a paper shredder and then set the shredder on fire. You add a <code>run: env</code> step to see what’s going on. You push again. You wait again. A twenty-minute feedback loop for a one-line change. You do this fourteen times. This is your afternoon now. You had plans. You were going to go outside. The afternoon belongs to the CI now. It has always belonged to the CI. You are only now perceiving this truth.</p>
<p>There is something devotional about the experience. You approach the logs. You make your offering of clicks and patience. The page considers your request. Sometimes it grants you the knowledge you seek. Sometimes it takes your browser tab instead, a small sacrifice, consumed, gone. You open a new tab. You try again. This is the ritual. You did not choose it. The work continues.</p>
<h2 id="the-yaml-trap">The YAML Trap</h2>
<p>Every CI system eventually becomes “a bunch of YAML.” I’ve been through the five stages of grief about it and emerged on the other side, diminished but functional. But GitHub Actions YAML is a special breed. It’s YAML with its own expression language bolted on, its own context object model, its own string interpolation rules, and a scattering of gotchas that will slowly hollow you out as a person. Each gotcha leaves a mark. The marks do not fade.</p>
<p>Have you ever tried to conditionally set an environment variable based on which branch you’re on? Have you done the <code>${{ }}</code> expression dance, misquoted something, and then waited four minutes for a runner to spin up just to discover your string got eaten? Of course you have. We all have. We have all stared at a diff that changes one character in a YAML expression and thought “I went to college for this.”</p>
<p>The expression syntax has the quality of a language that grew in the dark, unsupervised. It began as a convenience. It accreted features. Somewhere along the way it crossed a threshold, and now it exists in a liminal space- too complex to be configuration, too constrained to be a proper language. You learn its grammar not from documentation but from failure, each error message a koan that points toward understanding but does not provide it.</p>
<h2 id="but-the-marketplace">”But the Marketplace!”</h2>
<p>Ah yes, the GitHub Actions Marketplace. The npm of CI. A bazaar of community-maintained actions of varying quality, most of which are shell scripts with a <code>Dockerfile</code> and a dream.</p>
<p>Every time you type <code>uses: some-stranger/cool-action@v2</code>, you’re handing a stranger access to your repo, your secrets, and your build environment. Yes, you can pin to a SHA. Nobody does. And even if you do, you’re still running opaque code you didn’t write and probably haven’t read, in a context where it has access to your <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> and whatever else you’ve stuffed in there. Every action you add is another set of house keys you’re handing to someone you’ve never met and hoping for the best.</p>
<p>The Marketplace has the energy of a night market in a city you don’t know, where every stall sells something that claims to solve your problem. Some of them do. Some of them have other intentions. You cannot tell which is which from the outside. You can only install them and see what happens. This is called “dependency management.” We have normalized it. The normalization does not make it safe.</p>
<h2 id="you-dont-own-your-compute">You Don’t Own Your Compute</h2>
<p>With GitHub Actions, you’re renting Microsoft’s runners. They’re slow, they’re resource-constrained, you can’t customize them in any meaningful way, and you’re at the mercy of GitHub’s capacity planning. Need a beefy machine for a big build? You can pay for a larger runner, at prices that will get you a calendar invite from finance titled “we need to talk,” and you still don’t control the environment.</p>
<p>You know how I know GitHub’s runners are bad? Because there’s an entire cottage industry of companies whose sole product is “GitHub Actions, but the runners don’t suck.” Namespace, Blacksmith, Actuated, Runs-on, BuildJet. There are at least half a dozen startups that exist purely to solve the problem of GitHub Actions being slow. Their pitch is, essentially, “keep your workflows, we’ll just make them not take forever.” The fact that this is a viable business model, that multiple companies can sustain themselves on the premise that the default compute for the world’s most popular CI system is inadequate, tells you everything you need to know.</p>
<p>Now, to be fair, you <em>can</em> bring your own runners to GitHub Actions. Self-hosted runners exist. You can set up your own machines, install Nix, configure your environment exactly how you want it. And this does solve the compute problem. Your builds will be faster. Your caches will be warm. But you’ll still be writing GitHub Actions YAML. You’ll still be fighting the expression syntax and the permissions model and the marketplace and the log viewer that crashes your browser. You’ve upgraded the engine but you’re still driving the car that catches fire when you turn on the radio.</p>
<p>I think the people who originally built GitHub Actions were probably well-intentioned. They probably cared about developer experience. But this is a Microsoft product now, and Microsoft is where ambitious developer tools go to become enterprise SKUs. The original engineers have long since been reorged into other divisions or ground down into product managers. The vision, if there was one, is entombed now. But if you press your ear to the floor during a particularly slow build, you can still hear its heart beating, faintly, beneath the floorboards.</p>
<h2 id="the-little-things">The Little Things</h2>
<p>Things that seem small but accumulate. Each one is survivable. Together they form a compelling case for simply walking into the sea. The sea does not have YAML. The sea does not require a <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>actions/cache</code> action is an exercise in futility. Cache keys are confusing, cache misses are silent, and cache eviction is opaque. You will spend more time debugging caching than you save by having a cache.</p>
<p>Reusable workflows can’t be nested beyond a certain depth, can’t access the calling workflow’s context cleanly, and live in YAML files that are impossible to test in isolation. At some point you realize you’re writing a distributed system in YAML and you have to sit down and think about the choices that led you here. The thinking changes you. You do not get the old version of yourself back. That person didn’t know what a <code>workflow_call</code> trigger was. That person was happy.</p>
<p>The <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> permissions model is a maze. <code>permissions: write-all</code> is a hammer, fine-grained permissions are a puzzle, and the interaction between repository settings, workflow settings, and job-level settings will make you want to lie down on the floor. I once spent an entire day on token permissions. I will never get that day back. It’s gone. I could have learned to paint. I could have called my mother. I could have mass-tested a new CI system. Anything.</p>
<p>Concurrency controls are blunt. Cancel in-progress runs on the same branch? Sure, one line. Anything more nuanced? No. The system does not wish to discuss nuance. The system has other concerns.</p>
<p>Secrets can’t be used in <code>if</code> conditions. This means you can’t do things like <code>if: secrets.DEPLOY_KEY != ''</code> to conditionally run a step based on whether a secret is configured. GitHub doesn’t want secret values leaking into logs via expression evaluation, which is a reasonable security concern. But the practical result is that you can’t write workflows that gracefully degrade when optional secrets aren’t present. Instead you need awkward workarounds like setting a non-secret environment variable that flags whether the real secret exists. It’s one of those decisions that makes perfect sense in a security review and makes you want to scream when you’re actually trying to write a workflow that works in both forks and the main repo.</p>
<h2 id="just-write-bash-scripts">”Just Write Bash Scripts”</h2>
<p>At some point in every engineer’s CI journey, a temptation presents itself.</p>
<p>“What if I just wrote bash scripts?” the voice whispers. “What if I stopped fighting the CI system and just <code>run:</code>’d a big shell script that does everything? I could run it locally. I could test it. I’d be free.”</p>
<p>I understand the appeal. I have felt it myself, late at night, after the fourth failed workflow run in a row. The desire to burn down the YAML temple and return to the simple honest earth of <code>#!/bin/bash</code> and <code>set -euo pipefail</code>. To cast off the chains of marketplace actions and reusable workflows and just <em>write the damn commands</em>. It feels like liberation. It is not.</p>
<p>Here’s what actually happens. Your bash script works. You feel clever. You tell your coworkers about it. Then the script grows. It acquires conditionals. It acquires functions. It acquires argument parsing. It acquires a second script that it sources. Someone adds error handling. Someone else adds logging. Someone (and this person should be stopped, but never is) adds “just a little bit of parallelism.”</p>
<p>Three months later you have 800 lines of bash that reimplements job parallelism with <code>wait</code> and PID files, has its own retry logic built on a <code>for</code> loop and <code>sleep</code>, and parses its own output to determine success or failure. The script has become self-aware. There’s a race condition in the cleanup trap that only manifests on Linux kernel 6.x, and you are the only person who understands the script, and you are on vacation, and your phone is ringing.</p>
<p>You have not escaped CI. You have built a CI system. It’s just worse than every other CI system, because it’s written in bash, and nobody can follow it, and it has no test framework, and <code>shellcheck</code> is screaming into the void, and the void is also written in bash.</p>
<p>Bash is fine for glue. Bash is fine for “run these four commands in order.” Bash is not a build system. Bash is not a test harness. The fact that it can be coerced into impersonating both is not a recommendation. It’s a warning sign. You are not simplifying. You are moving complexity from a place with guardrails to a place with none. The complexity will not be grateful for its new freedom. The complexity will use its freedom to make your life worse.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="part-ii-the-emergence">Part II: The Emergence</h2>
<p>There are other ways to live. Buildkite is what CI should feel like. Not joyful, nothing about CI is joyful, but <em>tolerable</em>. A tool that understands its purpose and does not fight you. Let me tell you how the other half lives.</p>
<h2 id="a-log-viewer-that-does-not-consume-your-browser">A Log Viewer That Does Not Consume Your Browser</h2>
<p>Buildkite’s log viewer is just a web page that shows you logs and doesn’t crash. I realize that’s a low bar. It’s a bar that GitHub Actions trips over and falls face-first into the mud, gets up, slips again, and somehow sets the mud on fire.</p>
<p>The terminal output rendering is excellent. Build logs look like terminal output, because they are terminal output. ANSI colors work. Your test framework’s fancy formatting comes through intact. You’re not squinting at a web UI that has eaten your escape codes and rendered them as mojibake. This sounds minor. It is not minor. You are reading build logs dozens of times a day. The experience of reading them matters in the way that a comfortable chair matters. You only notice how much it matters after you’ve been sitting in a bad one for six hours and your back has filed a formal complaint.</p>
<p>Annotations let your build steps write rich Markdown output (test failure summaries, coverage reports, deploy links,) right into the build page. You don’t have to dig through log output to find the thing you care about. The information comes to you. After years of fighting GitHub Actions’ collapsible log groups and wondering which of the seventeen nested folds contains the actual error message, this feels like stepping out of a cave into sunlight.</p>
<p>And debugging? Buildkite doesn’t make CI debugging fun. Nothing does. Nothing can. It is one of the irreducible sufferings of our craft. But because the agent runs on your infrastructure, you can SSH into the box. You can look at what’s actually happening. You can reproduce the environment locally because <em>you built the environment</em>. You are still mortal, but at least you have tools.</p>
<h2 id="yaml-that-knows-its-place">YAML That Knows Its Place</h2>
<p>Buildkite has YAML too, but the difference is that Buildkite’s YAML is <em>just describing a pipeline</em>. Steps, commands, plugins. It’s a data structure, not a programming language cosplaying as a config format. When you need actual logic? You write a script. In a real language. That you can run locally. Like a human being with dignity and a will to live.</p>
<p>This is the boundary the bash zealots were actually looking for: not “put everything in bash,” but “put the orchestration in config and the logic in code.” Buildkite respects this boundary. GitHub Actions blurs it until you can no longer tell where configuration ends and programming begins, and then the programming happens in a language that can’t do basic arithmetic without <code>${{ }}</code> and a prayer.</p>
<h2 id="you-own-your-compute">You Own Your Compute</h2>
<p>With Buildkite, the agent is a single binary that runs on <em>your</em> machines. Your cloud, your on-prem boxes, your weird custom hardware. You control the instance types, the caching, the local storage, the network. Run agents on a fleet of massive EC2 instances with NVMe drives and 20 gigs of Docker layer cache. Run them on a Raspberry Pi. It doesn’t care. The fastest CI is the one with a warm cache on a big machine that you control.</p>
<p>You don’t see a cottage industry of “Buildkite, but faster.” You don’t need one. You just run bigger machines.</p>
<p>GitHub Actions will never give you this. GitHub Actions will give you a mass-produced Ubuntu VM with the emotional warmth of a hospital waiting room.</p>
<h3 id="a-note-on-running-your-own-infrastructure">A Note on Running Your Own Infrastructure</h3>
<p>I can hear the objection forming: “But I don’t want to run my own CI infrastructure. I just want to push code and have tests run.”</p>
<p>Fair. Running your own agents is not for everyone. If you’re maintaining a small open source library in your spare time, you shouldn’t have to spin up EC2 instances and manage autoscaling groups. GitHub Actions’ free tier for public repos is genuinely valuable for the OSS ecosystem, and I’m not here to tell a solo maintainer they need to set up Terraform to run their unit tests.</p>
<p>This post is mostly aimed at teams running production systems at businesses, places where you’re already managing infrastructure, where CI time is measured in engineering hours lost per week, where the build that takes 45 minutes is costing you real money in both compute and salary. If that’s you, the overhead of running Buildkite agents pays for itself quickly. If you’re publishing a 200-line npm package on your weekends, the calculus is different and that’s fine.</p>
<h2 id="dynamic-pipelines">Dynamic Pipelines</h2>
<p>In Buildkite, pipeline steps are just data. You can <em>generate them</em>.</p>
<p>Your pipeline YAML can contain a step that runs a script, and that script can emit more pipeline steps. Dynamically. At runtime. Based on whatever logic you want: which files changed, what day of the week it is, the phase of the moon, whether the build gods are feeling merciful.</p>
<p>So you write a script that looks at your monorepo, figures out what changed, and uploads exactly the right set of steps for the things that need building and testing. No hardcoded matrix. No <code>if: contains(github.event.pull_request...)</code> spaghetti. Just a program that outputs steps.</p>
<p>GitHub Actions has <code>matrix</code> strategies and <code>if</code> conditions and reusable workflows and all sorts of mechanisms that try to approximate this. They’re all worse. They’re declarative in the worst sense: you’re declaring things in a language that isn’t powerful enough to express what you mean, so you end up building a Rube Goldberg machine out of YAML and regret. The machine grows. You feed it. It does not thank you.</p>
<h2 id="on-the-matter-of-plugins">On the Matter of Plugins</h2>
<p>I’ll be honest: Buildkite’s plugin system is structurally pretty similar to the GitHub Actions Marketplace. You’re still pulling in third-party code from a repo. You’re still trusting someone else’s work. I won’t pretend there’s some magic architectural difference that makes this safe.</p>
<p>The real difference is narrower than I’d like: Buildkite plugins tend to be thin shell hooks rather than entire Docker images with their own runtime, so there’s less surface area to hide things in, and you can usually read the whole plugin in a few minutes. More importantly, they run on <em>your</em> infrastructure, so at least the blast radius is something you control. It’s not a solved problem. It’s a smaller problem.</p>
<h2 id="the-small-delights">The Small Delights</h2>
<p>Buildkite has custom emoji. You can put a little <code>:parrot:</code> or <code>:docker:</code> or your team’s custom emoji next to your pipeline steps. This is, objectively, a frivolous feature. It is also one of my favorite things about Buildkite, because it tells you something about the people who built it. They thought about what it <em>feels like</em> to use their product. They knew that CI is a slog and that a small dumb thing like a custom emoji next to your deploy step can make the slog a fraction more bearable.</p>
<p>GitHub Actions would never do this. GitHub Actions is a product designed by a committee that has never once asked “but is it delightful?” and it shows.</p>
<p>Buildkite is built by people who clearly use CI every day and have thought hard about what makes it tolerable. The result is a tool that, if not exactly joyful, at least does not make you want to lie down on the floor. In this industry, that’s high praise.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="but-everyone-uses-it">But Everyone Uses It!</h2>
<p>Yeah. GitHub Actions won by being the default, not by being good. It’s free for public repos, it’s built into the platform everyone already uses, and it’s Good Enough. It’s the Internet Explorer of CI. It ships with the thing. People use it because switching costs are real and life is finite and we’re all just trying to ship code and go home.</p>
<p>If you’re a small team with a simple app and straightforward tests, it’s probably fine. I’m not going to tell you to rip it out.</p>
<p>But if you’re running a real production system, if you have a monorepo, if your builds take more than five minutes, if you care about supply chain security, if you want to actually <em>own</em> your CI: look at Buildkite.</p>
<p>I’ve been doing this for a long time. I’ve watched CI systems come and go. I’ve helped build one. The pattern is always the same: the CI system that wins market share is never the one that’s best at being a CI system. It’s the one that’s easiest to start using.</p>
<p>GitHub Actions is the easiest CI to start using. Buildkite is the best CI to keep using. And in the long run (assuming your CI hasn’t already ground you into a fine paste, assuming the YAML hasn’t hollowed you out entirely, assuming there’s still someone left who remembers what it was like before,) that’s what matters.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>If your CI works and you’re happy, great, keep going. But if you’ve got that nagging feeling that it’s fighting you more than helping you: you’re not the problem. The tooling is. There are other ways to live.</em></p>   </div></div>]]></description>

    <h2>C Isn't A Programming Language Anymore</h2>
    <header>
    
    <p>March 16th, 2022</p>
</header>
<p>Phantomderp and I have both recently been very aligned on a particular subject: <a href="https://thephd.dev/to-save-c-we-must-save-abi-fixing-c-function-abi">being extremely angry about C ABIs</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/54341">trying to fix them</a>. Where we’re not aligned is <em>why</em> we’re mad about them.</p>
<p>He’s trying to materially improve the conditions of using C itself as a programming language.</p>
<p>I’m trying to materially improve the conditions of using literally any language other than C.</p>
<p>Now you might reasonably ask: “what the fuck does your problem have to do with C?”</p>
<p>It wouldn’t if C was actually a programming language. Unfortunately, it’s not, and it hasn’t been for a long time. This isn’t about the fact that C is actually horribly ill-defined <a href="https://thephd.dev/your-c-compiler-and-standard-library-will-not-help-you">due to a billion implementations</a> or its <a href="https://thephd.dev/intmax_t-hell-c++-c">completely failed</a> <a href="https://gankra.github.io/blah/rust-layouts-and-abis/#the-c-integer-hierarchy">integer hierarchy</a>.</p>
<p>That stuff sucks, but on its own that wouldn’t be <em>my</em> problem.</p>
<p><em>My</em> problem is that C was elevated to a role of prestige and power, its reign so absolute and eternal that it has completely distorted the way we speak to each other. Rust and Swift cannot simply speak their native and comfortable tongues – they must instead wrap themselves in a grotesque simulacra of C’s skin and make their flesh undulate in the same ways it does.</p>
<p>C is the <em>lingua franca</em> of programming. We must all speak C, and therefore C is not just a programming language anymore – it’s a protocol that every general-purpose programming language needs to speak. </p>
<p>So actually this kinda <em>is</em> about the whole “C is an inscrutable implementation-defined mess” thing. But only insofar as it makes this protocol we all have to use an even bigger nightmare!</p>
<h2 id="foreign-function-interfaces"><a href="#foreign-function-interfaces">§</a>Foreign Function Interfaces</h2>
<p>Ok let’s get technical. You’ve finished designing your new language, Bappyscript, with first class support for Bappy Paws/Hooves/Fins. An amazing language that’s going to completely revolutionize the way that cats, sheep, and sharks program!</p>
<p>But now you need to actually make it do something useful. You know like, take user input, or write output, or literally anything observable? If you want programs written in your language to be good little citizens that work well with the major operating systems, you need to interact with the operating system’s interface. I hear that everything on Linux is “just a file”, so let’s open a file on Linux!</p>
<p><em>googles</em></p>
<div><pre><code>OPEN(2)

</code></pre></div>
<p>Um sorry what? This is Bappyscript, not <em>C</em>. Where’s the Bappyscript interface for Linux?</p>
<p><em>googles</em></p>
<p>What do you <em>mean</em> there’s no Bappyscript interface for Linux!? Ok well sure it’s a brand-new language, but you’re going to add one, right? Right…?</p>
<p>Fuck ok, I guess we have to use what they’ve given us.</p>
<p>We’re going to need some kind of Interface that lets our language call Functions that are Foreign to it. A Foreign Function Interface… FFI… yeah! I like the sound of that!</p>
<p>Oh hey there Rust, you have C FFI too? And you too Swift? Even Python?!</p>
<img src="https://faultlore.com/blah/c-isnt-a-language/abi-kiss.png" alt="&quot;What if we kissed 😳 and we were both C&quot; over a page of the AMD64 SysV ABI, detailing how the calling convention is defined in terms of C types.">
<p>Everyone had to learn to speak C to talk to the major operating systems, and then when it came time to talk to <em>eachother</em> we suddenly all already spoke C so… why not talk to eachother in terms of C too?</p>
<p>Oops! Now C is the <em>lingua franca</em> of programming.</p>
<p>Oops! Now C isn’t just a programming language, it’s a <em>protocol</em>.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-talking-to-c-involve"><a href="#what-does-talking-to-c-involve">§</a>What Does Talking To C Involve?</h2>
<p>Ok so apparently basically every language has to learn to talk C. A language that is definitely very well-defined and not a mass hallucination.</p>
<p>What does “talking” C mean? It means getting descriptions of an interface’s types and functions in the form of a C header and somehow:</p>
<ul>
<li>matching the layouts of those types</li>
<li>doing some stuff with linkers to resolve the function’s symbols as pointers</li>
<li>calling those functions with the appropriate ABI (like putting args in the right registers)</li>
</ul>
<p>Well we’ve got a few problems here:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can’t actually write a C parser.</li>
<li>C doesn’t actually have an ABI. Or even defined type layouts.</li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, I am genuinely asserting that <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01633123/document">parsing C is basically impossible</a>.</p>
<p>“But wait! There are lots of tools that read in C headers! Like <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen/">rust-bindgen</a>!”</p>
<p>Nope:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>bindgen uses libclang to parse C and C++ header files. To modify how bindgen searches for libclang, see the clang-sys documentation. For more details on how bindgen uses libclang, see the bindgen users guide.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anyone who spends much time trying to parse C(++) headers very quickly says “ah, actually, fuck that” and asks a C(++) compiler to do it. Keep in mind that <em>meaningfully</em> parsing a C header is more than <em>just</em> parsing: you need to resolve #includes, typedefs, and macros too! So now you need to implement all of the platform’s header resolution logic <em>and</em> somehow figure out what things are DEFINED in the environment you care about! Yikes!</p>
<p>Like let’s take the really extreme example of Swift. It has basically everything going for it in terms of C interop and resources:</p>
<p>It’s a language developed by Apple to effectively replace Objective-C as the primary language for defining and using system APIs on its own platforms. In doing so, it has (imo) <a href="https://gankra.github.io/blah/swift-abi/">taken the notion of ABI-stability and design further than anyone else</a>.</p>
<p>It’s also one of the most hardcore FFI-supporting languages I’ve ever seen! It can natively import (Objective-)C(++) headers and will produce a nice and native Swift interface with types getting automagically “bridged” to their Swift equivalents at the boundary (often transparently due to the types having identical ABIs)!</p>
<p>Swift was also developed by many of the same people at Apple who built and maintain Clang and LLVM. Straight-up world-leading experts in C and its spawn. One of those people is Doug Gregor, let’s see what his opinion on C FFI is: </p>
<img src="https://faultlore.com/blah/c-isnt-a-language/doug-tweet.png" alt="A tweet from Doug Gregor: All of this is the reason that Swift uses Clang internally to handle the (C)++ ABI. That way, we’re not chasing every new ABI-impacting attribute Clang adds.">
<p>Ah, well fuck. Not even Swift has the stomach for this stuff.</p>
<p>(See also Jordan Rose’s and John McCall’s <a href="https://llvm.org/devmtg/2014-10/Slides/Skip%20the%20FFI.pdf">llvm presentation on why Swift went with this approach</a>)</p>
<p>So what do you do if you Absolutely Positively do not want to have a C compiler parsing and resolving headers at compile time?</p>
<p>You hand-translate those bad boys! <code>int64_t</code>? Write <code>i64</code>. <code>long</code>? Write… uhhhh… oh no.</p>
<p>What’s a long?</p>
<h2 id="c-doesnt-actually-have-an-abi"><a href="#c-doesnt-actually-have-an-abi">§</a>C Doesn’t Actually Have An ABI</h2>
<p>Ok well no big surprise here: the integer types in C that were designed to be wobbly-sized for “portability” are in fact wobbly-sized! Like ok we can punt on <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/climits">CHAR_BIT</a> being weird, but that still doesn’t help us know the size and align of <code>long</code>!</p>
<p>“But wait! There are standardized calling conventions and ABIs for each platform!”</p>
<p>There are! And they usually define the layouts of key primitives in C! (And some of them don’t just define the calling conventions in terms of C types! <em>side-eyes AMD64 SysV</em>)</p>
<p>Ok but here’s a nasty problem: the architecture doesn’t define the ABI. No not the OS either. We’ve gotta go all in on a specific <em>target triple</em> like “x86_64-pc-windows-gnu” (not to be mistaken with “x86_64-pc-windows-msvc”). </p>
<p>Ok how many of those could there be?</p>
<div><pre><code>&gt; rustc --print target-list

aarch64-apple-darwin
aarch64-apple-ios
aarch64-apple-ios-macabi
aarch64-apple-ios-sim
aarch64-apple-tvos
...
</code></pre></div>
<p>Wow ok that’s a lo-</p>
<div><pre><code>...
armv7-unknown-linux-musleabi

x86_64-uwp-windows-gnu
x86_64-uwp-windows-msvc
x86_64-wrs-vxworks

&gt;_
</code></pre></div>
<p>176 triples. I was originally going to include them all for the visual gag/impact but it’s literally too many for even that.</p>
<p>That’s too many fucking ABIs.</p>
<p>And we haven’t even gotten into all the different calling conventions like stdcall vs fastcall or aapcs vs aapcs-vfp!</p>
<p>Well at least all of these ABIs and calling conventions and what not are definitely available in a nice machine-readable format that everyone can use: PDFs full of human prose.</p>
<p>Ok well at least the major C compilers agree on the ABIs for a particular target triple! Like ok sure there’s weird jank C compilers but clang and gcc–</p>

<p>That’s my <a href="https://github.com/Gankra/abi-checker">FFI abi-checker</a> running on x64 Ubuntu 20.04. A pretty dang major and well-behaved platform! All it’s testing here is some very boring situations where some integer arguments get passed by-value between two static libs compiled by clang and gcc… and it fails!</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>clang and gcc can’t even agree on the ABI of <code>__int128</code> on x64 linux. That type <em>is</em> a gcc extension but it’s also explicitly defined and specified by the AMD64 SysV ABI in one of those nice human-readable PDFs!</p>
<p>I wrote this dang thing to check for <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/54341">mistakes in <em>rustc</em></a>, I didn’t expect to find inconsistencies between the two major C compilers on one of the most important and well-trodden ABIs!</p>
<p>ABIS ARE LIES</p>
<h2 id="trying-to-tame-c"><a href="#trying-to-tame-c">§</a>Trying To Tame C</h2>
<p>So actually <em>semantically</em> parsing a C header is a horrible nightmare that can only really be done by “the” C compiler for that platform, and even if you get the C compiler to tell you the types and and how to make sense of the annotations that <em>still</em> doesn’t actually tell you the size/align/convention for everything.</p>
<p>How do you interoperate with that mess?</p>
<p>Your first option is to completely surrender and soulbond your language with C, which can be any of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write your compiler/runtime in C(++) so it speaks C natively anyway.</li>
<li>Have your “codegen” just emit C(++) so the user needs a C compiler anyway.</li>
<li>Build your compiler on top of an established major C compiler (gcc or clang).</li>
</ul>
<p>But even these only take you so far, because unless your language is <em>literally</em> exposing <code>unsigned long long</code> you’re going to inherit C’s big portability mess.</p>
<p>This brings us to the second option: Lie, Cheat, And Steal.</p>
<p>If it’s all gonna be a dumpster fire anyway, you may as well just start hand-translating the type and interface definitions into your language. That’s basically what we do in Rust all day every day! Like yeah people use rust-bindgen and friends to automate some of this stuff, but a lot of the time the definitions get checked in or hand-tweaked because life is too short to try to get someone’s weird bespoke C build system working portably.</p>
<p>Hey Rust, what’s <a href="https://docs.rs/libc/0.2.120/libc/type.intmax_t.html"><code>intmax_t</code> on x64 linux</a>?</p>


<p>Cool! End of story!</p>
<p>Hey Nim, what’s <a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/system.html#clonglong"><code>long long</code> on x64 linux</a>?</p>
<div><pre><code>clonglong {.importc: "long long", nodecl.} = int64
</code></pre></div>
<p>Cool! End of story!</p>
<p>A lot of code has completely given up on keeping C in the loop and has started hardcoding the definitions of core types. After all, they’re clearly just part of the platform’s ABI! What are they going to do, change the size of <code>intmax_t</code>!? That’s obviously an ABI-breaking change!</p>
<p>Oh yeah what was that thing phantomderp <a href="https://thephd.dev/to-save-c-we-must-save-abi-fixing-c-function-abi">was working on again</a>?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We talked about how <code>intmax_t</code> can’t be changed because some binary, somewhere, would lose its mind and use the wrong calling convention / return convention if we changed from e.g. <code>long long</code> (64-bit integer) to <code>__int128_t</code> (128-bit integer). But is there a way that - if the code opted into it or something - we could upgrade the function calls for newer applications while leaving the older applications intact? Let’s craft some code that test the idea that Transparent Aliases can help with ABI.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fuuuuuuuucccccccckkkkkkkkkk Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck FUUUUUCK</p>
<p>So like, yeah their article is really good and working on some very real and very important problems but… how would programming languages even deal with this change? How would you specify which version of <code>intmax_t</code> you interoperate with? If some C header you have refers to <code>intmax_t</code>, which definition is it using?</p>
<p>The primary mechanism we have for talking about platforms with different ABIs are target triples. You know what’s one target triple? <code>x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu</code>. You know what that covers? Basically every major desktop/server linux distro from <em>the last 20 years</em>. Right now you can ostensibly compile for that target and get a binary that “just works” on all those platforms. I do not believe this would be the case if some programs were compiled believing <code>intmax_t</code> was larger than <code>int64_t</code>.</p>
<p>Would any platform that tries to make this change become a new target triple? <code>x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu2</code>? Would that even be enough if anything compiled against <code>x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu</code> was allowed to run on it?</p>
<h2 id="changing-signatures-without-breaking-abis"><a href="#changing-signatures-without-breaking-abis">§</a>Changing Signatures Without Breaking ABIs</h2>
<p>“So what, does C never get to improve anymore?”</p>
<p>No! But also, Yes! Because they shipped bad designs.</p>
<p>Making ABI-compatible changes is, honestly, a bit of an art form. Part of that art is <em>preparedness</em>. Specifically it’s much easier to make changes that don’t break ABI if you’re <em>prepared</em> for them.</p>
<p>As phantomderp’s article notes, things like glibc (the <code>g</code> is the <code>gnu</code> in <code>x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu</code>) have long understood this and use mechanisms like symbol versioning to update signatures and APIs while keeping the old versions around for anyone compiled against older versions of itself.</p>
<p>So if you have <code>int32_t my_rad_symbol(int32_t)</code>, you tell the compiler to export this as <code>my_rad_symbol_v1</code>, and anyone who compiles against your headers will <em>write</em> <code>my_rad_symbol</code> in their code but <em>link</em> against <code>my_rad_symbol_v1</code>.</p>
<p>Then when you decide Actually It Should Use <code>int64_t</code> then you can make <code>int64_t my_rad_symbol(int64_t)</code> as <code>my_rad_symbol_v2</code> <em>but keep around the old definition</em> as <code>my_rad_symbol_v1</code>. Anyone who compiles against newer versions of your header will happily use the v2 symbol, while anyone compiled against the older version will continue to use v1!</p>
<p>Except you still have a compatibility hazard: anyone who compiles against your new header can’t link against the old version of your library! The v1 version of your library simply <em>doesn’t</em> have the v2 symbol! So if you want the Hot New Features you need to accept incompatibility with older outdated systems.</p>
<p>This isn’t a deal breaker though, it just makes platform vendors <em>sad</em> that no one gets to use the thing they spent so much time working on right away. You have to ship a shiny new feature and then sit on your hands for several years while everyone waits for it to be common/mature enough that people are willing to depend on it and break support for older platforms (or are willing to implement dynamic checking and fallback for it).</p>
<p>If you get really serious about letting people upgrade right away, then you’re talking about <em>forward</em> compatability. This lets older versions of things somehow work with newer features that they have no conception of.</p>
<h2 id="changing-types-without-breaking-abis"><a href="#changing-types-without-breaking-abis">§</a>Changing Types Without Breaking ABIs</h2>
<p>Ok so we can change the signature of a function, what else can we change? Can we change type layouts?</p>
<p>Yes! But also, No! It depends on how you expose the type.</p>
<p>One of the genuinely fantastic features of C is that it lets you distinguish between a type which has a known layout and one that doesn’t. If you <em>only</em> forward-declare a type in a C header, then any user code that interacts with that type isn’t “allowed” to know the layout of that type and has to handle it opaquely behind a pointer at all times.</p>
<p>So you can make an API like <code>MyRadType* make_val()</code> and <code>use_val(MyRadType*)</code> and then do the same symbol versioning trick to expose <code>make_val_v1</code> and <code>use_val_v1</code> symbols, and any time you want to change that layout you bump the version on everything that interacts with that type. Similarly you keep around <code>MyRadTypeV1</code>, <code>MyRadTypeV2</code> and some typedefs to make sure people use the “right” one.</p>
<p>Nice, we can change type layouts between versions! …Right? Well, mostly.</p>
<p>If multiple things build on top of your library and then start talking to eachother in terms of your opaque types, bad things can start to happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>lib1: makes an API that takes <code>MyRadType*</code> and calls <code>use_val</code> with it</li>
<li>lib2: calls <code>make_val</code> and passed the result to lib1</li>
</ul>
<p>If lib1 and lib2 are <em>ever</em> compiled against different versions of your library, then <code>make_val_v1</code> can get fed into <code>use_val_v2</code>! Yikes! You have two options for dealing with this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Say that this is forbidden, chastise anyone who does it anyway, be sad.</li>
<li>Design <code>MyRadType</code> in a <em>forward-compatible</em> way so that mixing is fine.</li>
</ol>
<p>Common forward-compatible tricks include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reserving unused fields for future versions’ use.</li>
<li>Having a common prefix to all version of MyRadType that lets you “check” what version you’re working with.</li>
<li>Having self-size fields so older versions can “skip over” the new parts</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="case-study-minidump_handle_data"><a href="#case-study-minidump_handle_data">§</a>Case Study: MINIDUMP_HANDLE_DATA</h2>
<p>Microsoft is genuinely a master of this forward-compatability fuckery, to the extent that they even keep stuff they really care about layout-compatible <em>between architectures</em>. An example I’ve recently been working with is <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/minidumpapiset/ns-minidumpapiset-minidump_handle_data_stream">MINIDUMP_HANDLE_DATA_STREAM</a> in <code>Minidumpapiset.h</code>.</p>
<p>This API describes a versioned list of values. The list starts with this type:</p>
<div><pre><code>typedef struct _MINIDUMP_HANDLE_DATA_STREAM {
    ULONG32 SizeOfHeader;
    ULONG32 SizeOfDescriptor;
    ULONG32 NumberOfDescriptors;
    ULONG32 Reserved;
} MINIDUMP_HANDLE_DATA_STREAM, *PMINIDUMP_HANDLE_DATA_STREAM;
</code></pre></div>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>SizeOfHeader</code> is the size of MINIDUMP_HANDLE_DATA_STREAM itself. If they ever need to add more fields to the end, that’s fine, because older versions can use this value to detect the “version” of the header and also skip over any fields they don’t know about.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>SizeOfDescriptor</code> is the size of each element in the array. Once again this lets you know what “version” of the element you have and skip over any fields you don’t know about.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>NumberOfDescriptors</code> is array length</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Reserved</code> is some extra memory they decided to reserve in the header <em>anyway</em> (Minidumpapiset.h is extremely meticulous about never having padding anywhere because padding bytes have unspecified values and it’s a serialized binary file format. I expect they added this field to make the struct have a size that’s a multiple of 8 so that there wouldn’t be any question about whether the elements of the array needed padding after the header. Wow that’s taking compatibility serious!)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And indeed, Microsoft actually had a reason to use this versioning scheme, and defines two versions of the array element:</p>
<div><pre><code>typedef struct _MINIDUMP_HANDLE_DESCRIPTOR {
    ULONG64 Handle;
    RVA TypeNameRva;
    RVA ObjectNameRva;
    ULONG32 Attributes;
    ULONG32 GrantedAccess;
    ULONG32 HandleCount;
    ULONG32 PointerCount;
} MINIDUMP_HANDLE_DESCRIPTOR, *PMINIDUMP_HANDLE_DESCRIPTOR;

typedef struct _MINIDUMP_HANDLE_DESCRIPTOR_2 {
    ULONG64 Handle;
    RVA TypeNameRva;
    RVA ObjectNameRva;
    ULONG32 Attributes;
    ULONG32 GrantedAccess;
    ULONG32 HandleCount;
    ULONG32 PointerCount;
    RVA ObjectInfoRva;
    ULONG32 Reserved0;
} MINIDUMP_HANDLE_DESCRIPTOR_2, *PMINIDUMP_HANDLE_DESCRIPTOR_2;

// The latest MINIDUMP_HANDLE_DESCRIPTOR definition.
typedef MINIDUMP_HANDLE_DESCRIPTOR_2 MINIDUMP_HANDLE_DESCRIPTOR_N;
typedef MINIDUMP_HANDLE_DESCRIPTOR_N *PMINIDUMP_HANDLE_DESCRIPTOR_N;

</code></pre></div>
<p>The actual details of these structs isn’t terribly interesting other than:</p>
<ul>
<li>They only changed it by adding fields to the end</li>
<li>Have a typedef for “the latest one”</li>
<li>Reserved some Maybe Padding again (RVA is a ULONG32)</li>
</ul>
<p>This thing is an absolutely indestructible forward-compat <em>behemoth</em>. Hell, because they’re so careful with padding it even has the same layout between 32-bit and 64-bit! (Which is actually really important because you want a minidump processor on one architecture to be able to handle minidumps from <em>every</em> architecture.)</p>
<p>Well, at least it’s really robust if you play along with its game and actually manipulate things by-reference and use the size fields.</p>
<p>But hey, at least it’s very clear that there’s a game to play! At <em>some</em> point you do just have to say “you’re using this wrong”. Well ok no Microsoft probably wouldn’t say that, they’d just <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20040115-00/?p=41043">do something horrible instead</a>.</p>
<h2 id="case-study-jmp_buf"><a href="#case-study-jmp_buf">§</a>Case Study: jmp_buf</h2>
<p>I’m not terribly familiar with this situation, but while looking into historical glibc breaks I came across this great article in lwn: <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/605607/">The glibc s390 ABI break</a>. I’ll be assuming it’s accurate.</p>
<p>As it turns out, glibc <em>has</em> broken the ABI of types before, at least on s390. Based on the description of this article it was <em>chaos</em>.</p>
<p>Specifically they changed the layout of the save-state type used by setjmp/longjmp, <code>jmp_buf</code>. Now, they weren’t <em>complete</em> fools. They understood this was an ABI-breaking change, so they did the responsible symbol versioning thing.</p>
<p>But <code>jmp_buf</code> wasn’t an opaque type. Other things were storing instances of this type <em>inline</em>. Like oh you know, Perl’s runtime. Needless to say this <em>relatively obscure</em> type had wormed itself into many binaries and the ultimate conclusion was that everything in Debian needed to be recompiled!</p>
<p>Ouch!</p>
<p>The article even discusses the possibility of version-bumping libc to cope with this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The SO name bump in a mixed-ABI environment like debian results in two libc’s being loaded and competing for effectively the same namespace of symbols with resolution (and therefore selection of the ABI) being determined by ELF interposition and scope rules. It’s a nightmare. It’s possible a worse solution than just telling everyone to rebuild and get on with their lives.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Double Ouch!</p>
<p>(The article is full of lots more great details, I highly recommend it.)</p>
<h2 id="can-you-really-change-intmax_t"><a href="#can-you-really-change-intmax_t">§</a>Can You Really Change intmax_t?</h2>
<p>As far as I’m concerned, not really. It’s just like <code>jmp_buf</code> – it’s not an opaque type, and that means it’s inlined into a ton of random structs, assumed to have a specific representation by tons of other languages and compilers, and probably part of tons of public interfaces that aren’t under the control of libc, linux, or even the distro maintainers.</p>
<p>Sure, libc can properly do symbol versioning tricks to make <em>its</em> APIs work with the new definition, but changing the size of a really basic datatype like <code>intmax_t</code> is begging for chaos in the larger ecosystem for a platform.</p>
<p>I’m happy to be proven wrong, but as far as I can tell making this change would necessitate a new target triple <em>and</em> to not allow any binary/library built for the old ABI to run on this new triple. You can certainly do that work, but I don’t envy any distro which does.</p>
<p>And even <em>then</em> you have the x64 int problem: it’s such a fundamental type, and has been that size for <em>so long</em>, that countless applications may have weird undetectable assumptions about it. This is why int is 32-bit on x64 even though it was “supposed” to be 64-bit: int was 32-bit for <em>so long</em> that it was completely hopeless to update software to the new size even though it was a whole new architecture and target triple!</p>
<p>Again I hope I’m wrong but… sometimes you make a mistake so bad that you just <em>don’t</em> get to undo it. If C was a self-contained programming language? Sure, go for it.</p>
<p>But it’s not, it’s a protocol. A bad protocol certainly, but the protocol we have to use nonetheless!</p>
<p>Sorry C, you conquered the world, maybe you don’t get to have nice things anymore.</p>
<p>You don’t see England trying to improve itself, do you?</p>
