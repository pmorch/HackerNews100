<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="BodyComponentRenderer"><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>For much of the 21st century, software engineering has been seen as one of the safest havens in the tenuous and ever-changing American job market.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>But there are a growing number of signs that the field is starting to become a little less secure and comfortable, due to an industry-wide downturn and the <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7zxn7/learn-to-write-ai-advancements-mean-code-will-be-written-in-natural-english">looming threat of artificial intelligence</a> that is spurring growing competition for software jobs.&nbsp;</p></span></p><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“The amount of competition is insane,” said Joe Forzano, an unemployed software engineer who has worked at the mental health startup Alma and private equity giant Blackstone.&nbsp;</p></span></p><blockquote data-component="QuoteBlock"><p><em><strong>Has AI affected your job? We want to hear from you. From a non-work device, contact our reporter at maxwell.strachan@vice.com or via Signal at 310-614-3752 for extra security.</strong></em></p></blockquote><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Since he lost his job in March, Forzano has applied to over 250 jobs. In six cases, he went through the “full interview gauntlet,” which included between six and eight interviews each, before learning he had been passed over. “It has been very, very rough,” he told Motherboard.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Forzano is not alone in his pessimism, according to a December survey of 9,338 software engineers performed on behalf of Motherboard by Blind, an online anonymous platform for verified employees. In the poll, nearly nine in 10 surveyed software engineers said it is more difficult to get a job now than it was before the pandemic, with 66 percent saying it was “much harder.”&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Nearly 80 percent of respondents said the job market has even become more competitive over the last year. Only 6 percent of the software engineers were “extremely confident” they could find another job with the same total compensation if they lost their job today while 32 percent said they were “not at all confident.”&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Over 2022 and 2023, the tech sector incurred <a href="https://layoffs.fyi/" target="_blank">more than 400,000 layoffs</a>, according to the tracking site Layoffs.fyi. But up until recently, it seemed software engineers were more often spared compared to their co-workers in <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/3akddn/i-got-to-break-free-laid-off-tech-workers-search-for-new-purpose-outside-silicon-valley">non-technical fields</a>. One <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/silicon-valleys-talent-spotters-are-now-looking-for-jobs-11669725577" target="_blank">analysis found tech companies cut their recruiting teams</a> by 50 percent, compared to only 10 percent of their engineering departments. At Salesforce, engineers were four times less likely to lose their jobs than those in marketing and sales, which <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/these-tech-workers-say-they-were-hired-to-do-nothing-762ff158" target="_blank">Bloomberg has said</a> is a trend replicated at other tech companies such as Dell and Zoom.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span><span></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>But signs of dread among software engineers have started to become more common online. In December, one Amazon employee wrote a long post on the anonymous employee platform Blind saying that the “<a href="https://www.teamblind.com/post/Job-Market-is-Terrible-7anaSof8" target="_blank">job market is terrible</a>” and that he was struggling to get interviews of any sort.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The situation is a stark shift from much of the past two decades, when <a href="https://www.princetonreview.com/college-advice/top-ten-college-majors" target="_blank">computer science degrees and coding bootcamps exploded in popularity</a> due to the financial security they both promised. <a href="https://archive.is/jjBty" target="_blank">Entry-level Google software engineers reportedly</a> earned almost $200,000 a year and lived a life full of splashy perks, and engineers always seemed in high demand, meaning the next job was never hard to find.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>As an undergraduate at the University of Pennsylvania in the early 2010s, Forzano had decided to major in computer science. The degree had put him in $180,000 of debt, but he saw it as a calculated bet on a sturdy field of work. “The whole concept was [that] it was a good investment to have that ‘Ivy League degree’ in an engineering field,” he said. He thought he’d be set for life.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Early in his career, that seemed to be true. Recruiters spammed him with opportunities, and he was easily able to jump from job to job and became a manager. The field felt so secure that the phrase “learn to code” became a mocking rejoinder whenever people in other fields expressed concern about their own job prospects online.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span><span></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>But the messages from recruiters have largely dried up since the pandemic, and getting the sort of jobs software engineers took for granted has become much harder. “There's just so much fucking competition,” he said. “It's a completely different landscape.” Thinking back to his decision to major in computer science as an undergraduate, he said he now feels “very naive.”</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>With the entrance of artificial intelligence into the conversation recently, there have been signs of a sea change in the coding world. AI programs that allow users to write code using natural language or auto-complete code were among the first wave of AI tools to take off. <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7zxn7/learn-to-write-ai-advancements-mean-code-will-be-written-in-natural-english">Google CEO Sundar Pichai said last year</a> that AI-powered coding tools had reduced the time it takes workers to complete code by 6 percent.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“In the age of AI, computer science is no longer the safe major,” <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/09/computer-science-degree-value-generative-ai-age/675452/" target="_blank">Kelli María Korducki wrote in </a><em><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/09/computer-science-degree-value-generative-ai-age/675452/" target="_blank">The Atlantic</a></em> in September. Matt Welsh, an entrepreneur who used to serve as a computer science professor at Harvard, told the magazine that the ability of AI to perform software engineering functions could lead to less job security and lower compensation for all but the very best in the software trade.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>As of December, software engineers were not expressing much concern about AI making their jobs redundant. Only 28 percent saying they were “very” or “slightly” concerned in the Blind poll, and 72 percent saying they were “not really” or “not at all” concerned.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>But when not considering their own situation, the software engineering world’s views on AI became markedly less optimistic. More than 60 percent of those surveyed said they believed their company would hire fewer people because of AI moving forward. &nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Forzano has not been shy about his trouble, sharing his pursuit for a new job on social media. The decision has led him to feel less alone, he said, as other tech workers expressed similar frustration about not being able to get interviews for jobs they felt overqualified for.&nbsp;</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“We're all kind of like, ‘What the fuck is happening?’” he said.</p></span></p></div><div><p><h3>ORIGINAL REPORTING ON EVERYTHING THAT MATTERS IN YOUR INBOX.</h3></p><p>By signing up, you agree to the<!-- --> <a href="https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/privacy-policy/en_us/page/terms-of-use.html">Terms of Use</a> <!-- -->and<!-- --> <a href="https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/privacy-policy/en_us/page/privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a> <!-- -->&amp; to receive electronic communications from Vice Media Group, which may include marketing promotions, advertisements and sponsored content.</p></div></div>]]></description>

I retired a year and a half ago, and many of the people I worked with have also left. Justin Garrison hasn’t even left yet, and he just wrote a critical blog post “<a href="https://justingarrison.com/blog/2023-12-30-amazons-silent-sacking/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Amazon’s Silent Sacking</a>” about the way they are pushing people out. What changed?</p><p id="d3de">Growth slowed. When companies transition from high growth to slow growth or begin shrinking it isn’t just a small change, it needs a fundamentally different approach to management and the culture of the company. I saw this play out while I was at Sun Microsystems as the dot com bubble burst in 2001–2004. Adding headcount and budget every year covers up all kind of problems, it brings a flexibility to operations that becomes part of the culture. When growth is flat to shrinking companies freeze like deer in the headlights, and to make it worse managers start to hoard headcount and play politics to preserve their products. Innovation goes away, micromanagement appears and everyone gets less useful work done. I haven’t seen a good way to gradually manage this situation. The most successful approaches I’ve seen (which Sun didn’t do) are to cut deeply and early by shutting down entire product lines and removing layers of management, so that the company can grow back by opening headcount again. It’s like pruning a sickly tree. If you cut off the dead leaves one by one, you end up with too many branches and shriveled fruit. If you cut back hard, and remove whole branches, the roots provide enough energy for the tree to grow back. This does mean that you have to shut down or sell off entire product lines, and shrink the business. It’s very hard to contemplate and navigate this, which is why most companies don’t do it agressively enough. As an employee, it’s usually best to leave in the first wave of cuts.</p><p id="a158">In the unlikely event that a deep pruning and grow back strategy is happening at your company, and you are still there, the product teams that are left after pruning should try to keep the most experienced employees, lay off the junior ones, and return managers to individual contributor positions where possible. Experienced employees have been through this before, make better judgement calls under stress, and communicate better. There is a tendency to micromanage and add process overhead that needs to be resisted. Simplify processes to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Delicate-Art-Bureaucracy-Transformation-Wrestler/dp/1950508153" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">reduce bureaucracy</a> and management overhead, speed up time-to-value, and take advantage of the gaps in the market that appear as competitors fail.</p><p id="c50c">Founder led companies often have problems maintaining their innovation culture when the founder moves on. I think this is part of the problem at Amazon, and I was happy to be leaving as Andy Jassy took over from Jeff Bezos and Adam Selipsky took over AWS. Jeff Bezos was always focused on keeping the “Day 1” culture at Amazon, and everyone I talk to there is clear that it’s now “Day 2”. Politics and micromanagement have taken over, and HR processes take up far too much of everyone’s time.</p><p id="977f">There’s another red flag for me when large real estate construction projects take up too much management attention. The plans for Amazon HQ2, and the building of ever larger and fancier office tower blocks in Seattle by Amazon collided with Covid, lockdown and an accelerated work from home movement. The right thing to do coming out of lockdown would have been to write down the real estate investment in one go, re-negotiate the tax incentives that cities provide, embrace remote working, and continue the policy Amazon had at the time, where each director level leader could decide what was best for their teams. Instead, we now have the situation that Amazon management care more about real estate than product. Where is the customer obsession in that? Customers don’t care what the companies buildings are like. As Justin says, they are using Return To Office (RTO) to drive people out of the company without needing to fire them. By analogy, pruning by cutting off the best remaining leaves and fruit buds one at a time, leaving the dead wood behind.</p><p id="674e">[Update] Since posting this I’ve had private messages from people at Amazon thanking me for saying what they aren’t allowed to say internally. “Disagree and commit” has been weaponized to force the RTO policy on everyone. In a group making a decision, it’s usually a majority that agree with the decision, and the people that don’t agree see that they are outnumbered and commit to it. However with RTO I think it is a minority imposing an unpopular policy on everyone else, without supporting data or discussion. Disagreeing is career-limiting, so what we are seeing is “Disagree and quit”. People are interviewing while waiting for their next RSU grant. Someone also said that it’s not “Day 2” it’s “Day 3”, and did I know anywhere that is hiring?.</p><p id="76f2">In summary, I don’t think the situation for Amazon is as bad as it was for Sun in 2002, and in the short term they are going to continue to grow the business slowly. However I do think there’s lessons to be learned, and that the delusion that they can roll back work from home and enforce RTO without killing off innovation is a big problem that will increasingly hurt them over time. I personally hired a bunch of people into AWS, in my own team and by encouraging people to join elsewhere. Nowadays I’d say a hard no to anyone thinking of working there, they have shown that you can’t trust whatever they say during the interview process. Local management gets overruled to relocate people hired to be remote, and to move to locations that they can change arbitrarily. Try and get a job at somewhere growing rapidly with a sensible work location policy like NVIDIA instead.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  
  <p><span>&nbsp;Published on 15 Dec 2023 ·
    &nbsp;Filed in <a href="https://blog.scottlowe.org/categories/explanation">Explanation</a> ·
    &nbsp;304 words (estimated 2 minutes to read)</span></p><p>Building on the earlier article on <a href="https://blog.scottlowe.org/2023/12/11/automatically-transforming-git-urls/">automatically transforming Git URLs</a>, I’m back with another article on a (potentially powerful) feature of <a href="https://www.git-scm.com/">Git</a>—the ability to conditionally include Git configuration files. This means you can configure Git to be configured (and behave) differently based on certain conditions, simply by including or not including Git configuration files. Let’s look at a pretty straightforward example taken from my own workflow.</p>
<p>Here’s a configuration stanza from my own system-wide Git configuration:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="toml"><span><span>[<span>includeIf</span> <span>"gitdir:~/Work/Code/Repos/"</span>]
</span></span><span><span>    <span>path</span> = <span>~/</span><span>Work</span><span>/</span><span>Code</span><span>/</span><span>Repos</span><span>/</span>.<span>gitconfig</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The key here is the <code>includeIf</code> keyword. In this case, Git will include the referenced configuration file specified by <code>path</code>, <em>if</em> the location of the Git repository matches the path specification after <code>gitdir</code>. Basically, what this means is that <em>all</em> repositories under <code>~/Work/Code/Repos</code> will trigger the inclusion of the additional configuration file.</p>
<p>Here’s the additional configuration file:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="toml"><span><span>[<span>user</span>]
</span></span><span><span>    <span>email</span> = <span>name</span><span>@</span><span>work-domain</span>.<span>com</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>name</span> = <span>Scott</span> <span>Lowe</span>
</span></span><span><span>[<span>commit</span>]
</span></span><span><span>    <span>gpgsign</span> = <span>false</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>As long as I group all work-relatd repositories in the specified directory path, these values override the system-wide values. This means I can specify my work e-mail address as the e-mail address to be associated with commits to work-related repositories while all others use a different e-mail address. This configuration also allows me to disable GPG signing of commits for work-related repositories (i.e., repositories in the specified path), since I don’t have a GPG key associated with my work e-mail address.</p>
<p>Could you do this with per-repository configuration settings? <em>Absolutely.</em> This configuration mechanism allows you to apply configuration settings to groups of repositories based on their filesystem location, instead of having to do the same thing on a per-repository basis.</p>

Today, it serves the US and Canada, Latin America, the Caribbean, and, as of January this year, the <a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/netflix-arrives-in-the-uk-at-5-99-per-month-launches-with-one-month-free-trial" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UK and Ireland</a>, where it finally arrived to exchange blows with LoveFilm.</p>
<p>Cast your mind back to when the company launched the <a href="http://www.netflixprize.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Netflix Prize</a>. Announced in 2006, the prize sought to reward clever people for developing a recommendation algorithm. The company offered $1 million to whoever could improve the accuracy of its existing system, Cinematch, by 10%.</p>
<p>On September 21, 2009 <a href="http://www.netflixprize.com/community/viewtopic.php?id=1537" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">the mammoth prize was given</a> to team <em>BellKor’s Pragmatic Chaos</em>, who produced an algorithm which apparently <a href="http://www.netflixprize.com//leaderboard" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">improved the search by 10.06%</a>.</p>

<h3>Whatever happened to that $1m algorithm?</h3>

Indeed, by the time the algorithm was good to go, Netflix as a business had moved on.</p>
<p>Whilst they acknowledge that the work that went into the final product was immense, Xavier Amatriain and Justin Basilico, Personalization Science and Engineering at Netflix, say that the engineering effort required to achieve the accuracy gains they measured, wasn’t entirely justified.</p>
<p>“This is a truly impressive compilation and culmination of years of work, blending hundreds of predictive models to finally cross the finish line,” they say. “We evaluated some of the new methods offline but the additional accuracy gains that we measured did not seem to justify the engineering effort needed to bring them into a production environment. Also, our focus on improving Netflix personalization had shifted to the next level by then.”</p>
<p>Basically, streaming changed the way its members interacted with Netflix, as well as the type of data available in its algorithms. “For DVDs our goal is to help people fill their queue with titles to receive in the mail over the coming days and weeks; selection is distant in time from viewing, people select carefully because exchanging a DVD for another takes more than a day, and we get no feedback during viewing,” they say. “For streaming members who are looking for something great to watch right now; they can sample a few videos before settling on one, they can consume several in one session, and we can observe viewing statistics such as whether a video was watched fully or only partially.”</p>
<p>But this is an interesting point, in that it highlights the differences between ‘watch now’ and ‘watch later’ behaviours. As TechDirt’s Masnick <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/blog/innovation/articles/20120409/03412518422/why-netflix-never-implemented-algorithm-that-won-netflix-1-million-challenge.shtml" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">says</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I also find it interesting that there’s a clear distinction in the kinds of recommendations people that work if people are going to ‘watch now’ vs. ‘watch in the future’.</p>
<p>I think this is an issue that Netflix probably has faced on the DVD side for years: when people rent a movie that won’t arrive for a few days, they’re making a bet on what they want at some future point. And, people tend to have a more… optimistic viewpoint of their future selves. That is, they may be willing to rent, say, an “artsy” movie that won’t show up for a few days, feeling that they’ll be in the mood to watch it a few days (weeks?) in the future, knowing they’re not in the mood immediately.</p>
<p>But when the choice is immediate, they deal with their present selves, and that choice can be quite different. It would be great if Netflix revealed a bit more about those differences, but it is already interesting to see that the shift from delayed gratification to instant gratification clearly makes a difference in the kinds of recommendations that work for people.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Netflix also says that another big change to come about was the move from a single platform onto hundreds of devices, for example when it integrated with Roku and Xbox in 2008, which was already a couple of years into the competition. Then Netflix streaming made it to the iPhone, before hitting Android and range of other connected devices. In short, a one-algorithm approach clearly won’t work across such a wide range of platforms.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting the global availability of Netflix. It’s now extended beyond the US and in to Canada, 43 Latin-American countries plus the UK and Ireland. It has 23 million subscribers in 47 countries, who streamed 2 billion hours from multiple devices in Q4 2011 alone. Every day 2 million movies and TV shows are queued, and 4 million ratings are generated. So how does personalization cope with such a massive multifaceted jump in usage?</p>
<p>“We have adapted our personalization algorithms to this new scenario in such a way that now 75% of what people watch is from some sort of recommendation,” says Netflix. “We reached this point by continuously optimizing the member experience and have measured significant gains in member satisfaction whenever we improved the personalization for our members.”</p>
<p>Well, $1m may sound like a lot of money for Netflix to pay for something that wasn’t really used, but we’re sure Bob Bell, Martin Chabbert, Michael Jahrer, Yehuda Koren, Martin Piotte, Andreas Töscher and Chris Volinsky from <em>BellKor’s Pragmatic Chaos</em> don’t mind too much.</p>

            <strong>TL;DR</strong> –&nbsp;we finally have a way to create
            <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/custom-elements.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">our own HTML elements</a>
            and use them in any framework we want!
          </p>
          <p>
            Thanks to the popularity of frameworks such as Angular, Vue, and React, component-driven development has
            become a part of our every day lives. Components help us encapsulate styles and behaviors into reusable
            building blocks. They make a lot of sense in terms of design, development, and testing.
          </p>
          <p>Unfortunately, <em>framework-specific</em> components fail us in a number of ways:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>You can only use them in the framework they’re designed for 🔒</li>
            <li>Their lifespan is limited to that of the framework’s ⏳</li>
            <li>
              New frameworks/versions can lead to breaking changes, requiring substantial effort to update components 😭
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Web components solve these problems. They’re
            <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=custom-elementsv1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">supported by all modern browsers</a>, they’re framework-agnostic, and they’re
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">part of the standard</a>, so we know they’ll be supported for many years to come.
          </p>
          <p>This is the technology that Shoelace is built on.</p>

            Shoelace provides a collection of professionally designed, highly customizable UI components built on a
            framework agnostic technology. Why spend hundreds of hours (or more) building a design system from scratch?
            Why make a component library that only works with one framework?
          </p>
          <p>With Shoelace, you can:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Start building things faster (no need to roll your own buttons)</li>
            <li>Build multiple apps with different frameworks that all share the same UI components</li>
            <li>Fully customize components to match your existing designs</li>
            <li>Incrementally adopt components as needed (no need to ditch your framework)</li>
            <li>Upgrade or switch frameworks without rebuilding foundational components</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If your organization is looking to build a design system,
            <a href="https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/and-you-thought-buttons-were-easy-26eb5b5c1871" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Shoelace will save you thousands of dollars</a>. All the foundational components you need are right here, ready to be customized for your brand. And since
            it’s built on web standards, browsers will continue to support it for many years to come.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether you use Shoelace as a starting point for your organization’s design system or for a fun personal
            project, there’s no limit to what you can do with it.

            If you need to support IE11 or pre-Chromium Edge, this library isn’t for you. Although web components can
            (to some degree) be polyfilled for legacy browsers, supporting them is outside the scope of this project. If
            you’re using Shoelace in such a browser, you’re gonna have a bad time. ⛷

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-storage/a-huge-battery-has-replaced-hawaiis-last-coal-plant">https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-storage/a-huge-battery-has-replaced-hawaiis-last-coal-plant</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38941747">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p dir="ltr">Hawaiian Electric’s modeling suggests it can reduce curtailment of renewables by an estimated <span>69</span>% for the first five years thanks to Kapolei Energy Storage, allowing surplus clean electricity that would otherwise go to waste to get onto the&nbsp;grid.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The utility also requested <span></span>​<span>“</span>black-start capability.” If a&nbsp;disaster, like a&nbsp;cyclone or earthquake, knocks out the grid completely, Hawaiian Electric needs a&nbsp;power source to restart it. The Kapolei batteries are programmed to hold some energy in reserve for that purpose. Plus Power located the project near a&nbsp;substation connected to three other power plants so the battery <span></span>​<span>“</span>can be <span>AAA</span> to jump-start those other plants,” Keefe&nbsp;said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The combination of all these abilities in one site — capacity, grid services, black start — leads Keefe to call Kapolei <span></span>​<span>“</span>the most advanced battery energy storage facility on the planet.”</p>
<h2><strong>Model for a&nbsp;reliable clean-energy grid</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">The new battery is just the latest dispatch from Hawaii’s long-held spot at the vanguard of the energy transition. This is the state that hit mass rooftop solar adoption first and crafted the <a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/kauai-is-a-clean-energy-leader-its-secret-a-publicly-owned-grid">first utility-scale solar-battery plant</a> in Kauai (not coincidentally, Plus Power <span>CCO</span> Bob Rudd had a&nbsp;hand in that project during his tenure at&nbsp;Tesla).</p>
<p dir="ltr">But when renewables growth and fossil-plant retirements pass a&nbsp;certain threshold, as they have in Hawaii, simply adding more wind, solar or batteries isn’t sufficient. The clean technologies, which run on digitally controlled inverters, have to start maintaining the grid, not just feeding it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Plenty of other batteries provide frequency services to other grids, and a&nbsp;few of them are larger than Kapolei. But this is the only large-scale battery that we’ve seen capable of combining the basic peak capacity, frequency response, synthetic inertia and grid-rebooting tasks. That’s because Kapolei plays a&nbsp;more central role in its grid than battery plants do elsewhere.</p>
<p dir="ltr">After years of construction, California’s grid battery fleet <a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/batteries/chart-the-remarkable-rise-of-californias-grid-battery-capacity#">surpassed <span>5</span>,<span>000</span>&nbsp;megawatts installed</a> last year, but that only equates to <span>7</span>.<span>6</span>% of the mammoth nameplate capacity of the state’s grid. Kapolei alone constitutes about <span>17</span>% of Oahu’s peak capacity. Hawaiian Electric needed it to take on more responsibility than batteries elsewhere have ever had&nbsp;to.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Take <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/news/program/2020/inertia-and-the-power-grid-a-guide-without-the-spin.html">inertia</a>, which stabilizes grid frequency, as one example. Old plants provide this passively, through the spinning mass of their turbines; inertia didn’t need to be defined and compensated for separately in bygone decades because it was part of the package of running a&nbsp;power plant.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Now, across the country, the grid is moving to a&nbsp;model of maximizing cheap renewables when they are available and burning fuel when renewables aren’t. But the thermal plants need to be spinning to provide inertia — sometimes, on the mainland, renewables get curtailed to keep old coal plants running so they can deliver these grid services, Keefe said. This can be a&nbsp;bad deal for electricity customers, not to mention the climate.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Advanced batteries provide a&nbsp;synthetic version of this inertia through savvy programming of their inverters. This offers a&nbsp;more economic alternative while avoiding unnecessary carbon emissions. They also are faster and more precise — Keefe likened the Kapolei battery to a&nbsp;zippy electric sports car compared to the lumbering diesel bus of old thermal plants. That makes batteries a&nbsp;good technical fit for grids that are becoming increasingly volatile due to the fluctuations of renewable production.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Longer-term, U.S. climate goals require a&nbsp;phaseout of fossil fuels from the electric grid. Hydropower and nuclear plants help deliver valuable grid inertia without carbon emissions, but they aren’t on track to&nbsp;grow.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That’s why this project matters to the clean energy shift everywhere: It’s one of the first real-life examples of how to shift critical grid functions from fossil-fueled plants to clean energy plants. And eventually, the kind of grid services Kapolei has pioneered will have to scale nationwide.<br></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
    
<p><span>A small group</span> of volunteers from Israel’s tech sector is working tirelessly to remove content it says doesn’t belong on platforms like Facebook and TikTok, tapping personal connections at those and other Big Tech companies to have posts deleted outside official channels, the project’s founder told The Intercept.</p>



<p>The project’s moniker, “Iron Truth,” echoes the Israeli military’s vaunted Iron Dome rocket interception system. The brainchild of Dani Kaganovitch, a Tel Aviv-based software engineer at Google, Iron Truth claims its tech industry back channels have led to the removal of roughly 1,000 posts tagged by its members as false, antisemitic, or “pro-terrorist” across platforms such as X, YouTube, and TikTok.</p>



<p>In an interview, Kaganovitch said he launched the project after the October 7 Hamas attack, when he saw a Facebook video that cast doubt on alleged Hamas atrocities. “It had some elements of disinformation,” he told The Intercept. “The person who made the video said there were no beheaded babies, no women were raped, 200 bodies is a fake. As I saw this video, I was very pissed off. I copied the URL of the video and sent it to a team in [Facebook parent company] Meta, some Israelis that work for Meta, and I told them that this video needs to be removed and actually they removed it after a few days.”</p>



<p>Billed as both a fight against falsehood and a “fight for public opinion,” according to a post announcing the project on Kaganovitch’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231209002510/https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dannykg_israel-hamas-hamasisis-activity-7119952867225985024-nzuV/">LinkedIn profile</a>, Iron Truth vividly illustrates the perils and pitfalls of terms like “misinformation” and “disinformation” in wartime, as well as the mission creep they enable. The project’s public face is <a href="https://t.me/IronTruthBot">a Telegram bot</a> that crowdsources reports of “inflammatory” posts, which Iron Truth’s organizers then forward to sympathetic insiders. “We have direct channels with Israelis who work in the big companies,” Kaganovitch said in an October 13 message to the Iron Truth Telegram group. “There are compassionate ones who take care of a quick removal.” The Intercept used Telegram’s built-in translation feature to review the Hebrew-language chat transcripts.</p>



<!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[0](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PULLQUOTE%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22center%22%7D) --><blockquote data-shortcode-type="pullquote" data-pull="center"><!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[0] -->Iron Truth vividly illustrates the perils and pitfalls of terms like “misinformation” and “disinformation” in wartime.<!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[0] --></blockquote><!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[0] -->



<p>So far, nearly 2,000 participants have flagged a wide variety of posts for removal, from content that’s clearly racist or false to posts that are merely critical of Israel or sympathetic to Palestinians, according to chat logs reviewed by The Intercept. “In the U.S. there is free speech,” Kaganovitch explained. “Anyone can say anything with disinformation. This is very dangerous, we can see now.”</p>



<p>“The interests of a fact checking or counter-disinformation group working in the context of a war belongs to one belligerent or another. Their job is to look out for the interests of their side,” explained Emerson Brooking, a fellow with the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab. “They’re not trying to ensure an open, secure, accessible online space for all, free from disinformation. They’re trying to target and remove information and disinformation that they see as harmful or dangerous to Israelis.”</p>



<p>While Iron Truth appears to have frequently conflated criticism or even mere discussion of Israeli state violence with misinformation or antisemitism, Kaganovitch says his views on this are evolving. “In the beginning of the war, it was anger, most of the reporting was anger,” he told The Intercept. “Anti-Israel, anti-Zionist, anything related to this was received as fake, even if it was not.”</p>



<p>The Intercept was unable to independently confirm that sympathetic workers at Big Tech firms are responding to the group’s complaints or verify that the group was behind the removal of the content it has taken credit for having deleted. Iron Truth’s founder declined to share the names of its “insiders,” stating that they did not want to discuss their respective back channels with the press. In general, “they are not from the policy team but they have connections to the policy team,” Kaganovitch told The Intercept, referring to the personnel at social media firms who set rules for permissible speech. “Most of them are product managers, software developers. … They work with the policy teams with an internal set of tools to forward links and explanations about why they need to be removed.” While companies like Meta routinely engage with various civil society groups and NGOs to discuss and remove content, these discussions are typically run through their official content policy teams, not rank-and-file employees.</p>



<p>The Iron Truth Telegram account regularly credits these supposed insiders. “Thanks to the TikTok Israel team who fight for us and for the truth,” read an October 28 post on the group’s Telegram channel. “We work closely with Facebook, today we spoke with more senior managers,” according to another post on October 17. Soon after a Telegram chat member complained that something they’d posted to LinkedIn had attracted “inflammatory commenters,” the Iron Truth account replied, “Kudos to the social network LinkedIn who recruited a special team and have so far removed 60% of the content we reported on.”</p>


<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[1](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) -->

<!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[1] -->



<p>Kaganovitch said the project has allies outside Israel’s Silicon Valley annexes as well. Iron Truth’s organizers met with the director of a controversial Israeli government cyber unit, he said, and its core team of more than 50 volunteers and 10 programmers includes a former member of the Israeli Parliament.</p>



<p>“Eventually our main goal is to get the tech companies to differentiate between freedom of speech and posts that their only goal is to harm Israel and to interfere with the relationship between Israel and Palestine to make the war even worse,” Inbar Bezek, the former Knesset member working with Iron Truth, told The Intercept in a WhatsApp message.</p>



<p>“Across our products, we have policies in place to mitigate abuse, prevent harmful content and help keep users safe. We enforce them consistently and without bias,” Google spokesperson Christa Muldoon told The Intercept. “If a user or employee believes they’ve found content that violates these policies, we encourage them to report it through the dedicated online channels.” Muldoon added that Google “encourages employees to use their time and skills to volunteer for causes they care about.” In interviews with The Intercept, Kaganovitch emphasized that he works on Iron Truth only in his free time, and said the project is entirely distinct from his day job at Google.</p>



<p>Meta spokesperson Ryan Daniels pushed back on the notion that Iron Truth was able to get content taken down outside the platform’s official processes, but declined to comment on Iron Truth’s underlying claim of a back channel to company employees. “Multiple pieces of content this group claims to have gotten removed from Facebook and Instagram are still live and visible today because they don’t violate our policies,” Daniels told The Intercept in an emailed statement. “The idea that we remove content based on someone’s personal beliefs, religion, or ethnicity is simply inaccurate.” Daniels added, “We receive feedback about potentially violating content from a variety of people, including employees, and we encourage anyone who sees this type of content to report it so we can investigate and take action according to our policies,” noting that Meta employees have access to internal content reporting tools, but that this system can only be used to remove posts that violate the company’s public Community Standards.</p>



<p>Neither TikTok nor LinkedIn responded to questions about Iron Truth. X could not be reached for comment.</p>

<h2 id="h-keep-bombing">“Keep Bombing!”</h2>



<p>Though confusion and recrimination are natural byproducts of any armed conflict, Iron Truth has routinely used the fog of war as evidence of anti-Israeli disinformation.</p>



<p>At the start of the project in the week after Hamas’s attack, for example, Iron Truth volunteers were encouraged to find and report posts expressing skepticism about claims of the mass decapitation of babies in an Israeli kibbutz. They quickly surfaced posts casting doubt on reports of “40 beheaded babies” during the Hamas attack, tagging them “fake news” and “disinformation” and sending them to platforms for removal. Among a list of LinkedIn content that Iron Truth told its Telegram followers it had passed along to the company was a post demanding evidence for the beheaded baby claim, categorized by the project as “Terror/Fake.”</p>



<p>But the skepticism they were attacking proved warranted. While many of Hamas’s atrocities against Israelis on October 7 are indisputable, the Israeli government itself ultimately said it <a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/10/11/israel-hamas-disinformation/">couldn’t verify</a> the horrific claim about<a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/12/14/israel-biden-beheaded-babies-false/"> beheaded babies</a>. Similarly, Iron Truth’s early efforts to take down “disinformation” about Israel bombing hospitals now contrast with weeks of well-documented airstrikes against multiple hospitals and the deaths of <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/11/16/1213307710/gaza-doctors-al-shifa-hospital">hundreds of doctors</a> from Israeli bombs.</p>



<p>On October 16, Iron Truth shared a list of Facebook and Instagram posts it claimed responsibility for removing, writing on Telegram, “Significant things reported today and deleted. Good job! Keep bombing! 💪”</p>



<p>While most of the links no longer work, several are still active. One is a video of grievously wounded Palestinians in a hospital, including young children, with a caption accusing Israel of crimes against humanity. Another is a video from Mohamed El-Attar, a Canadian social media personality who posts under the name “That Muslim Guy.” In the post, shared the day after the Hamas attack, El-Attar argued the October 7 assault was not an act of terror, but of armed resistance to Israeli occupation. While this statement is no doubt inflammatory to many, particularly in Israel, Meta is supposed to allow for this sort of discussion, according to internal policy guidance previously reported by The Intercept. The <a href="https://theintercept.com/document/facebook-praise-support-and-representation-moderation-guidelines-reproduced-snapshot/">internal language</a>, which detailed the company’s Dangerous Individuals and Organizations policy, lists this sentence among examples of permitted speech: “The IRA were pushed towards violence by the brutal practices of the British government in Ireland.”</p>



<!-- BLOCK(promote-post)[3](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PROMOTE_POST%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22slug%22%3A%22israel-palestine%22%2C%22crop%22%3A%22promo%22%7D) -->  
<!-- END-BLOCK(promote-post)[3] -->



<p>While it’s possible for Meta posts to be deleted by moderators and later reinstated, Daniels, the spokesperson, disputed Iron Truth’s claim, saying links from the list that remain active had never been taken down in the first place. Daniels added that other links on the list had indeed been removed because they violated Meta policy but declined to comment on specific posts.</p>



<p>Under their own rules, the major social platforms aren’t supposed to remove content simply because it is controversial. While content moderation trigger-happiness around mere mentions of designated terror organizations has led to <a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/09/21/facebook-censorship-palestine-israel-algorithm/">undue censorship </a>of Palestinian and other Middle Eastern users, Big Tech policies on misinformation are, on paper, much more conservative. Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube, for example, only prohibit misinformation when it might cause physical harm, like snake oil cures for Covid-19, or posts meant to interfere with civic functions such as elections. None of the platforms targeted by Iron Truth prohibit merely “inflammatory” speech; indeed, such a policy would likely be the end of social media as we know it.</p>



<p>Still, content moderation rules are known to be vaguely conceived and erratically enforced. Meta for instance, says it categorically prohibits violent incitement, and touts various machine learning-based technologies to detect and remove such speech. Last month, however, The Intercept reported that the company had approved <a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/11/21/facebook-ad-israel-palestine-violence/">Facebook ads calling for the assassination</a> of a prominent Palestinian rights advocate, along with explicit calls for the murder of civilians in Gaza. On Instagram, users leaving comments with Palestinian flag emojis have seen these responses <a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/10/28/instagram-palestinian-flag-emoji/">inexplicably vanished</a>. 7amleh, a Palestinian digital rights organization that formally partners with Meta on speech issues, has documented over 800 reports of undue social media censorship since the war’s start, <a href="https://7or.7amleh.org/charts?start_date=10%2F07%2F2023&amp;end_date=12%2F12%2F2023&amp;type=14&amp;platform=&amp;platformIntegrate=&amp;gender=&amp;person_type=&amp;suspended_account=&amp;suspended_content=&amp;affiliation=&amp;affiliation=">according to its public database</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-disinformation-in-the-eye-of-the-beholder">Disinformation in the Eye of the Beholder</h2>



<p>“It’s really hard to identify disinformation,” Kaganovitch acknowledged in an interview, conceding that what’s considered a conspiracy today might be corroborated tomorrow, and pointing to a recent Haaretz report that an <a href="https://www.haaretz.co.il/news/politics/2023-11-18/ty-article/0000018b-e1a5-d168-a3ef-f5ff4d070000">Israel Defense Forces helicopter may have inadvertently killed Israelis</a> on October 7 in the course of firing at Hamas.</p>



<p>Throughout October, Iron Truth provided a list of suggested keywords for volunteers in the project’s Telegram group to use when searching for content to report to the bot. Some of these terms, like “Kill Jewish” and “Kill Israelis,” pertained to content flagrantly against the rules of major social media platforms, which uniformly ban explicit violent incitement. Others reflected stances that might understandably offend Israeli social media users still reeling from the Hamas attack, like “Nazi flag israel.”</p>



<p>But many other suggestions included terms commonly found in news coverage or general discussion of the war, particularly in reference to Israel’s brutal bombardment of Gaza. Some of those phrases — including “Israel bomb hospital”; “Israel bomb churches”; “Israel bomb humanitarian”; and “Israel committing genocide” — were suggested as disinformation keywords as the Israeli military was being credibly accused of doing those very things. While some allegations against both Hamas and the IDF were and continue to be bitterly disputed — notably who bombed the Al-Ahli Arab Hospital on October 17 — Iron Truth routinely treated contested claims as “fake news,” siding against the sort of <a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/12/20/gaza-israel-biden-netanyahu-war-strategy/">analysis</a> or<a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/11/21/al-shifa-hospital-hamas-israel/"> discussion </a>often necessary to reach the truth.</p>



<!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[4](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PULLQUOTE%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22right%22%7D) --><blockquote data-shortcode-type="pullquote" data-pull="right"><!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[4] -->“This post must be taken down, he is a really annoying liar and the amount of exposure he has is crazy.”<!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[4] --></blockquote><!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[4] -->



<p>Even the words “Israel lied” were suggested to Iron Truth volunteers on the grounds that they could be used in “false posts.” On October 16, two days after an Israeli airstrike killed 70 Palestinians <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/israel-hamas-war-live-updates-rcna120252">evacuating from northern Gaza</a>, one Telegram group member shared a TikTok containing imagery of one of the bombed convoys. “This post must be taken down, he is a really annoying liar and the amount of exposure he has is crazy,” the member added. A minute later, the Iron Truth administrator account encouraged this member to report the post to the Iron Truth bot.</p>



<p>Although The Intercept is unable to see which links have been submitted to the bot, Telegram transcripts show the group’s administrator frequently encouraged users to flag posts accusing Israel of genocide or other war crimes. When a chat member shared a link to an Instagram post arguing “It has BEEN a genocide since the Nakba in 1948 when Palestinians were forcibly removed from their land by Israel with Britain’s support and it has continued for the past 75 years with US tax payer dollars,” the group administrator encouraged them to report the post to the bot three minutes later. Links to similar allegations of Israeli war crimes from figures such as popular Twitch streamer Hasan Piker; Colombian President Gustavo Petro; psychologist Gabor Maté; and a variety of obscure, ordinary social media users have received the same treatment.</p>



<p>Iron Truth has acknowledged its alleged back channel has limits: “It’s not immediate unfortunately, things go through a chain of people on the way,” Kaganovitch explained to one Telegram group member who complained a post they’d reported was still online. “There are companies that implement faster and there are companies that work more slowly. There is internal pressure from the Israelis in the big companies to speed up the reports and removal of the content. We are in constant contact with them 24/7.”</p>

<!-- END-BLOCK(cta)[5] -->



<p>Since the war began, social media users in Gaza and beyond have complained that content has been censored without any clear violation of a given company’s policies, a well-documented phenomenon long before the current conflict. But Brooking, of the Atlantic Council, cautioned that it can be difficult to determine the process that led to the removal of&nbsp;a given social media post. “There are almost certainly people from tech companies who are receptive to and will work with a civil society organization like this,” he said. “But there’s a considerable gulf between claiming those tech company contacts and having a major influence on tech company decision making.”</p>



<p>Iron Truth has found targets outside social media too. On November 27, one volunteer shared a link to NoThanks, an Android app that helps users boycott companies related to Israel. The Iron Truth administrator account quickly noted that the complaint had been forwarded to Google. Days later, Google<a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20231205-google-removes-israel-boycott-app/"> pulled NoThanks from its app store</a>, though it was later reinstated. </p>



<p>The group has also gone after efforts to fundraise for Gaza. “These cuties are raising money,” said one volunteer, sharing a link to the Instagram account of Medical Aid for Palestinians. Again, the Iron Truth admin quickly followed up, saying the post had been “transferred” accordingly.</p>



<p>But Kaganovitch says his thinking around the topic of Israeli genocide has shifted. “I changed my thoughts a bit during the war,” he explained. Though he doesn’t agree that Israel is committing a genocide in Gaza, where the death toll has exceeded 20,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, he understands how others might. “The genocide, I stopped reporting it in about the third week [of the war].”</p>



<p>Several weeks after its launch, Iron Truth shared an infographic in its Telegram channel asking its followers not to pass along posts that were simply anti-Zionist. But OCT7, an Israeli group that “monitors the social web in real-time … and guides digital warriors,” lists Iron Truth as one of its partner organizations, alongside the Israeli Ministry for Diaspora Affairs, and cites “anti-Zionist bias” as part of the “challenge” it’s “battling against.”</p>



<p>Despite Iron Truth’s occasional attempts to rein in its volunteers and focus them on finding posts that might actually violate platform rules, getting everyone on board has proven difficult. Chat transcripts show many Iron Truth volunteers conflating Palestinian advocacy with material support for Hamas or characterizing news coverage as “misinformation” or “disinformation,” perennially vague terms whose meaning is further diluted in times of war and crisis.</p>



<p>“By the way, it would not be bad to go through the profiles of [United Nations] employees, the majority are local there and they are all supporters of terrorists,” recommended one follower in October. “Friends, report a profile of someone who is raising funds for Gaza!” said another Telegram group member, linking to the Instagram account of a New York-based beauty influencer. “Report this profile, it’s someone I met on a trip and it turns out she’s completely pro-Palestinian!” the same user added later that day. Social media accounts of Palestinian journalist Yara Eid; Palestinian photojournalist Motaz Azaiza; and many others involved in Palestinian human rights advocacy were similarly flagged by Iron Truth volunteers for allegedly spreading “false information.”</p>



<p>Iron Truth has at times struggled with its own followers. When one proposed reporting a link about <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/16/why-egypt-gaza-rafah-crossing-vital-for-supplying-aid-amid-israeli-strikes">Israeli airstrikes at the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt</a>, the administrator account pointed out that the IDF had indeed conducted the attacks, urging the group: “Let’s focus on disinformation, we are not fighting media organizations.” On another occasion, the administrator discouraged a user from reporting a page belonging to a news organization: “What’s the problem with that?” the administrator asked, noting that the outlet was “not pro-Israel, but is there fake news?”</p>



<p>But Iron Truth’s standards often seem muddled or contradictory. When one volunteer suggested going after B’Tselem, an Israeli human rights organization that advocates <a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/10/13/israel-settlers-gaza-palestinians-west-bank/">against the country’s military occupation</a> and <a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/11/29/intercepted-israel-palestine-prisoner-hostage/">broader repression of Palestinians</a>, the administrator account replied: “With all due respect, B’Tselem does publish pro-Palestinian content and this was also reported to us and passed on to the appropriate person. But B’Tselem is not Hamas bots or terrorist supporters, we have tens of thousands of posts to deal with.”</p>

<h2 id="h-friends-in-high-places"><strong>Friends in High Places</strong></h2>



<p>Though Iron Truth is largely a byproduct of Israel’s thriving tech economy — the country is home to many regional offices of American tech giants — it also claims support from the Israeli government.</p>



<p>The group’s founder says that Iron Truth leadership have met with Haim Wismonsky, director of the controversial Cyber Unit of the Israeli State Attorney’s Office. While the Cyber Unit purports to combat terrorism and miscellaneous cybercrime, critics say it’s used to censor unwanted criticism and Palestinian perspectives, relaying thousands upon thousands of content takedown demands. American Big Tech has proven largely willing to play ball with these demands: A 2018 report from the Israeli Ministry of Justice claimed a <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/10/08/israel/palestine-facebook-censors-discussion-rights-issues">90 percent compliance rate across social media platforms</a>.</p>



<p>Following an in-person presentation to the Cyber Unit, Iron Truth’s organizers have remained in contact, and sometimes forward the office links they need help removing, Kaganovitch said. “We showed them the presentation, they asked us also to monitor Reddit and Discord, but Reddit is not really popular here in Israel, so we focus on the big platforms right now.”</p>



<p>Wismonsky did not respond to a request for comment.</p>



<p>Kaganovitch noted that Bezek, the former Knesset member, “helps us with diplomatic and government&nbsp;relationships.” In an interview, Bezek confirmed her role and corroborated the group’s claims, saying that while Iron Truth had contacts with “many other employees” at social media firms, she is not involved in that aspect of the group’s work, adding, “I took on myself to be more like the legislation and legal connection.”</p>



<p>“What we’re doing on a daily basis is that we have a few groups of people who have social media profiles in different medias — LinkedIn, X, Meta, etc. — and if one of us is finding content that is antisemitic or content that is hate claims against Israel or against Jews, we are informing the other people in the group, and few people at the same time are reporting to the tech companies,” Bezek explained.</p>



<p>Bezek’s governmental outreach has so far included organizing meetings with Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and “European ambassadors in Israel.” Bezek declined to name the Israeli politicians or European diplomatic personnel involved because their communications are ongoing. These meetings have included allegations of foreign, state-sponsored “antisemitic campaigns and anti-Israeli campaigns,” which Bezek says Iron Truth is collecting evidence about in the hope of pressuring the United Nations to act.</p>



<p>Iron Truth has also collaborated with Digital Dome, a similar volunteer effort spearheaded by the Israeli anti-disinformation organization FakeReporter, which helps coordinate the mass reporting of unwanted social media content. Israeli American investment fund J-Ventures, which has reportedly worked directly with the IDF to advance Israeli military interests, has <a href="https://jackpoulson.substack.com/p/inside-the-pro-israel-information">promoted both Iron Truth and Digital Dome</a>.</p>



<p>FakeReporter did not respond to a request for comment.</p>



<p>While most counter-misinformation efforts betray some geopolitical loyalty, Iron Truth is openly nationalistic. An <a href="https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/sy0ojiig6">October 28 write-up</a> in the popular Israeli news website Ynet — “Want to Help With Public Diplomacy? This is How You Start”— cited the Telegram bot as an example of how ordinary Israelis could help their country, noting: “In the absence of a functioning Information Ministry, Israeli men and women hope to be able to influence even a little bit the sounding board on the net.” A <a href="https://www.bizportal.co.il/globalmarkets/news/article/820311">mention</a> in the Israeli financial news website BizPortal described Iron Truth as fighting “false and inciting content against Israel.”</p>



<p>Iron Truth is “a powerful reminder that it’s still people who run these companies at the end of the day,” said Brooking. “I think it’s natural to try to create these coordinated reporting groups when you feel that your country is at war in or in danger, and it’s natural to use every tool at your disposal, including the language of disinformation or fact checking, to try to remove as much content as possible if you think it’s harmful to you or people you love.”</p>



<p>The real risk, Brooking said, lies not in the back channel, but in the extent to which companies that control the speech of billions around the world are receptive to insiders arbitrarily policing expression. “If it’s elevating content for review that gets around trust and safety teams, standing policy, policy [into] which these companies put a lot of work,” he said, “then that’s a problem.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Humans have dreamed about traveling to other star systems and setting foot on alien worlds for generations. To put it mildly, interstellar exploration is a very daunting task.</p><p>As Universe Today explored in a <a href="https://www.universetoday.com/163132/tiny-swarming-spacecraft-could-establish-communications-with-proxima-centauri/">previous post</a>, it would take between 19,000 and 81,000 years for a spacecraft to reach Proxima Centauri using conventional propulsion (or those that are feasible using current technology). On top of that, there are numerous risks when traveling through the interstellar medium (ISM), not all of which are well-understood.</p><p>Under the circumstances, gram-scale spacecraft that rely on directed-energy propulsion (AKA lasers) appear to be the only viable option for reaching neighboring stars in this century.</p><p>Proposed concepts include the<span> </span><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/general/swarming-proxima-centauri/">Swarming Proxima Centauri</a>, a collaborative effort between<span> </span><a href="https://www.space-initiatives.com/">Space Initiatives Inc.</a><span> </span>and the<span> </span><a href="https://i4is.org/">Initiative for Interstellar Studies</a><span> </span>(i4is) led by Space Initiative's chief scientist<span> </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tmeubanks/">Marshall Eubanks</a>. The concept was recently selected for<span> </span><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/general/swarming-proxima-centauri/">Phase I development</a><span> </span>as part of this year's<span> </span><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/stmd-the-nasa-innovative-advanced-concepts-niac/">NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts</a><span> </span>(NIAC) program.</p><p>According to Eubanks, traveling through interstellar space is a question of distance, energy, and speed. At a distance of 4.25 light-years (40 trillion km; 25 trillion mi) from the Solar System, even Proxima Centauri is unfathomably far away.</p><p>To put it in perspective, the record for the farthest distance ever traveled by a spacecraft goes to the<span> </span><em><a href="https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/">Voyager 1</a></em><span> </span>space probe, which is currently more than 24 billion km (15 billion miles) from Earth. Using conventional methods, the probe accomplished a maximum speed of 61,500 km/h (38,215 mph) and has been traveling for more than 46 years straight.</p><p>In short, traveling at anything less than relativistic speed (a fraction of the speed of light) will make interstellar transits incredibly long and entirely impractical. Given the energy requirements this calls for, anything other than small spacecraft with a maximum mass of a few grams is feasible. As Eubanks told Universe Today via email:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>"Of course, rockets are a common way to go fast. Rockets work by throwing "stuff" (typically hot gas) out the back, the momentum in the stuff going backwards equaling that in the velocity increase of the vehicle in the forward direction. The essence of rocketry is that it is only really efficient if the velocity of the stuff going backwards is comparable to the velocity you want to gain going forward. If it isn't, if it is very much smaller, you just can't carry enough stuff to gain the velocity you want.</em></p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><em>"The trouble is that we have no technology – no energy source – that would enable us to throw out a lot of stuff at anything like 60,000 km/sec, and so rockets won't work. <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/antimatter" data-linkid="73014" data-postid="116276" rel="nofollow" target="_self">Antimatter</a> might conceivably enable this, but we just don't understand antimatter well enough – and can't make anywhere near enough of it – to make this a solution, probably for many decades to come."</em></p>
</blockquote><p>In contrast, concepts like Breakthrough Starshot and the Proxima Swarm consist of "inverting the rocket" – i.e., instead of throwing stuff out, stuff is thrown at the spacecraft. Instead of heavy propellant, which constitutes the majority of conventional rockets, the energy source for a lightsail is photons (which have no mass and move at the speed of light).</p><p>But as Eubanks indicated, this does not overcome the issue of energy, making it even more important that the spacecraft be as small as possible.</p><p>"Bouncing photons off of a laser sail thus solves the speed-of-stuff problem," he said.</p><p>"But the trouble is, there is not much momentum in a photon, so we need a<span> </span><em>lot<span> </span></em>of them. And given the power we are likely to have available, even a couple of decades from now, the thrust will be weak, so the mass of the probes needs to be very small – grams, not tons."</p><p>Their proposal calls for a 100-gigawatt (GW) laser beamer boosting thousands of gram-scale space probes with laser sails to relativistic speed (~10-20 percent of light). They also proposed a series of terrestrial light buckets measuring a square kilometer (0.386 mi<sup>2</sup>) in diameter to catch the light signals from the probes once they are well on their way to reaching Proxima Centauri (and communications become more difficult).</p><p>By their estimates, this mission concept could be ready for development around midcentury and could reach Proxima Centauri and its Earth-like exoplanet (<a href="https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exoplanet-catalog/7167/proxima-centauri-b/">Proxima b</a>) by the third quarter of this century (2075 or after).</p><figure id="attachment_116316" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-116316"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/01/swarming_proxima_centauri_nasa.webp" alt="diagram showing a swarm of probes approaching proxima centauri, improving their odds of arriving" width="1024" height="587" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/01/swarming_proxima_centauri_nasa.webp 1024w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/01/swarming_proxima_centauri_nasa-642x368.webp 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/01/swarming_proxima_centauri_nasa-724x415.webp 724w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/01/swarming_proxima_centauri_nasa-768x440.webp 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/01/swarming_proxima_centauri_nasa-600x344.webp 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-116316">A graphic depiction of the Swarming Proxima Centauri project. (<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/general/swarming-proxima-centauri/">Thomas Eubanks/NASA</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>In a<span> </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.07061.pdf">previous paper</a>, Eubanks and his colleagues demonstrated how a fleet of a thousand spacecraft could overcome the difficulties imposed by interstellar travel and maintaining communications with Earth through swarm dynamics.</p><p>"By raising the collecting area to a doable 1 km<sup>2</sup><span> </span>and having many probes coordinate their sending, we can get a reasonable (if smaller) bit rate," he added.</p><p>However, the eight-year round-trip lag on communications imposed by interstellar distances and <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/general-relativity" data-linkid="73026" data-postid="116276" rel="nofollow" target="_self">General Relativity</a> makes controlling the probes remotely from Earth impossible.</p><p>As such, the swarm must possess an extraordinary degree of autonomy when it comes to navigation (coordinating a thousand probes) and deciding what data is returned to Earth. While these strategies address distance, energy, and speed (at least for the time being), there is still the issue of how much it will cost to create the swarm and the associated infrastructure.</p><p>The single greatest expense will be the laser array itself, whereas the gram-scale craft will be reasonably cheap to produce. As Eubanks told Universe Today in a<span> </span><a href="https://www.universetoday.com/163132/tiny-swarming-spacecraft-could-establish-communications-with-proxima-centauri/">previous article</a>, their proposal can be developed with a budget of $100 billion.</p><p>But as Eubanks emphasized (then and now), the benefits of the mission architecture they've envisioned are legion, and the payoff of sending a swarm of probes to Proxima Centauri would be astronomical:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>"The simple fact is that the cost of a laser-propelled interstellar mission, with light-weight probes and a huge laser system to propel them to the stars, will be dominated by capital costs – the costs of the laser system."</em></p>
<p><em>"The probes themselves will be pretty cheap by comparison. So, if you can send one, you should send lots. Clearly, sending a lot of probes brings the advantage of redundancy." </em></p>
<p><em>"Space travel is risky, and interstellar travel is likely to be especially risky, so if we send a lot of probes, we can tolerate a high loss rate. But we can do a lot more."</em></p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><em>"We want to look for signs of biology and even technology, and so it would be good to get probes very close to the planet, to get good pictures and spectra of the surface and atmosphere." </em></p>
<p><em>"That will be tough for one probe, as we don't know very well where the planet will be 24-plus years in the future. By sending a bunch of probes in a spread, at least a few should get close to the planet, giving us the close-up view we want."</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Beyond that, Eubanks and his colleagues hope that the development of a coherent swarm of robotic probes will have applications closer to home. Swarm robotics is a hot field of research today and is being investigated as a possible means of<span> </span><a href="https://www.universetoday.com/156529/a-swarm-of-swimming-robots-to-search-for-life-under-the-ice-on-europa/">exploring Europa's interior ocean</a>,<span> </span><a href="https://www.universetoday.com/151244/swarms-of-robots-could-dig-underground-cities-on-mars/">digging underground cities on Mars</a>,<span> </span><a href="https://www.universetoday.com/143749/an-army-of-tiny-robots-could-assemble-huge-structures-in-space/">assembling</a><span> </span>large structures in space, and providing extreme weather tracking from Earth's orbit.</p><p>Beyond space exploration and Earth observation, swarm robotics also has applications in<span> </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780128174630000113">medicine</a>, additive manufacturing,<span> </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780081002490000136">environmental studies</a>,<span> </span><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6907374">global positioning and navigation</a>,<span> </span><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9244647">search and rescue</a>, and more.</p><p>While it could take many decades before an interstellar mission is ready to travel to Alpha Centauri, Eubanks, and his colleagues are honored and excited to be among NASA's selectees for the 2024 NIAC program. For them, the research took many years but is closer to realization than ever.</p><p>"It's been a long time – almost a decade – and we feel honored to be selected," said Eubanks.

																<p>AWS has notified customers of its Amazon Aurora Serverless v1 service that it will cease supporting the offering at the end of 2024. Replacing v1 in the Aurora Serverless range, which supports Postgres and MySQL databases, will be v2, which offers some advantages but also one big disadvantage: It doesn’t scale all the way down to zero.</p>
<p>Amazon Aurora is the hugely successful relational database service launched by <a href="http://www.aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a> in 2014. It debuted with MySQL compatibility, and support for Postgres was added in 2017. The database, which is part of AWS’s <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/">Relational Database Service</a> (RDS), has been so widely adopted that, a couple of years ago, AWS declared Aurora <a href="https://www.datanami.com/2021/12/03/aws-working-to-scale-aurora-db-writes-globally-like-spanner/">the fastest growing service</a> ever in the history of the company. Considering the continued momentum behind Postgres, it’s likely the AWS service has continued to grow at a breakneck speed.</p>
<p>In 2018, AWS rolled out a serverless version of Aurora, which enabled the database to scale up and down in response to application demand. Many customers appreciated that Aurora could scale all the way down to zero–essentially turning itself off–when there was no demand for the database, and automatically wake itself up when called into duty.</p>
<p>That function was a feature of Aurora Serverless v1.&nbsp; Last week, AWS began notifying customers that Aurora Serverless V1 would cease being offered as of December 31, 2024.</p>
<p>“We are only announcing the end of support for Serverless v1,” the note from AWS read, according to several customers who shared the note on the Internet. “Aurora Serverless v2 continues to be supported. We recommend that you proactively upgrade your databases running Amazon Aurora Serverless v1 to Amazon Aurora Serverless v2 at your convenience before December 31, 2024.”<a href="https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/PostgreSQL_logo.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/PostgreSQL_logo-300x193.png" alt="" width="300" height="193" srcset="https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/PostgreSQL_logo-300x193.png 300w, https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/PostgreSQL_logo-200x128.png 200w, https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/PostgreSQL_logo-100x64.png 100w, https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/PostgreSQL_logo-120x77.png 120w, https://www.datanami.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/PostgreSQL_logo.png 676w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p>
<p>Aurora Serverless v2, which AWS <a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/2022/4/aws-announces-general-availability-of-amazon-aurora-serverless-v2">unveiled in April 2022</a>, does have several features that v1 lacks, including support for replicas, logical replication, and–thanks to <a href="https://www.datanami.com/this-just-in/aws-announces-3-serverless-innovations-to-help-customers-analyze-and-manage-data-at-any-scale/">a major update</a> AWS delivered just over a month ago at re:Invent–global databases that can scale up to support million of writes per second.</p>
<p>Aurora Serverless v2 also sports <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/12/amazon-aurora-postgresql-rds-data-api/">the new RDS data API</a>, which AWS unveiled last week and which allows customers to connect to the Aurora database via REST (only Postgres is supported at the moment).</p>
<p>“You can now access these Aurora clusters via a secure HTTP endpoint and run SQL statements without the use of database drivers and without managing connections,” AWS says in its December 21, 2023 announcement.</p>
<p>However, Aurora Serverless v2 lacks one big feature that is a part of Aurora Serverless v1: The capability to scale all the way down to zero. That rubs some Aurora customers the wrong way.</p>
<p>“Goodbye to a relational database that could idle down to zero on its own,” wrote Ganesh Swaminathan, head of cloud solutions architecture at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, <a href="https://twitter.com/jeremy_daly/status/1740475761113604451">in a tweet</a> on X (formerly Twitter). “Hello to double the bill (or more)…”</p>
<p>“I’m pretty disappointed that Aurora Serverless V2 cannot seem to scale to 0 ACU,” writes <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/18sx0i6/aurora_serverless_v1_eol_december_31_2024/">a Reddit user</a> known as zmose. “Ya know, what ‘serverless’ is supposed to mean? I think it ends up being around like $50/month at minimum.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="post-content">
                            <p>One of Karl Marx’s most penetrating insights was that a network of mechanisms embedded in the logic of capitalism not only fuel the system’s transformative dynamism but also undermine its cohesion. These internal contradictions operate across every dimension of the socioeconomic landscape, including its ideological characteristics and political institutions. In their relentless pursuit of profits, capitalist enterprises constantly strive to reduce their labor costs through wage suppression and mechanization. But reductions in the buying power of workers erode the primary source of demand for the products those enterprises must sell in order to realize profits.</p>
<p>Capitalism gave rise to a value system that teaches us to find meaning in our work; yet millions are employed in low-paying, soul-crushing jobs. And while modern capitalism promises — and is indeed fully capable of providing — broad-based prosperity, the system, via the state, routinely promotes and enforces austerity policies aimed at compelling people to work harder for lower pay and less job security. Output per worker increases year by year because of improvements in technology, but the austerity evangelists insist that if we want capitalism to continue to bestow its blessings on humanity, workers must accept lower living standards and the social safety net needs to be dismantled.</p>
<p>In <em><a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/C/bo181707138.html">The Capital Order</a></em>, Clara Mattei brings to light the fascinating story of how austerity became a crucial weapon of class warfare. In this major contribution to the political and intellectual history of modern capitalism, Mattei traces the roots of neoliberalism to the political reaction against the militant working-class movements that emerged in Europe after World War I.</p>
<p>Modern warfare requires the mobilization of labor and capital on an enormous scale. During the Great War, national governments took control of their economies to ensure that the material requirements of the war would be met. Wages, work hours, and prices were regulated; production targets were imposed on manufacturers; strikes were criminalized, and shirking was penalized by conscription and deployment to the front; private property was requisitioned; key industries were nationalized. The aim of these policies was to ensure maximum production for the war effort without triggering a disruptive backlash from either the working class or the owners of capital.</p>
<p>But these massive wartime interventions exposed an inconvenient fact. Economic forces never operate independently of society’s political dynamics. If the state could mold the economy to serve the needs of war, in peacetime it could mold it to promote the well-being of those whose sweat, muscles, and brains are the basis of national prosperity. The war had demonstrated “the profoundly political nature of the capitalist economy.” When the war ended, workers, who had toiled and bled for their country, wanted a fairer share of the income their labor was generating; they wanted the right to unionize; and they wanted better working conditions, decent housing, and an effective social safety net.</p>
<p>In Britain and Italy, workers were organized, had suffrage rights, and, by 1919, were making demands on employers and the state for a revision of the social contract. This threat to the prerogatives of capital, Mattei argues, provoked a reaction in the form of a comprehensive set of state-imposed austerity policies aimed at pounding the working class into a state of docility. In addition to repelling the existential menace of working-class militancy, these policies would establish lasting mechanisms for channeling income and wealth upward from workers to capitalists.</p>
<p>Mattei describes these developments splendidly in the early chapters of her book. She has done an impressive amount of archival research and has skillfully mined the published literature of the interwar period. The fruit of these labors is a rich and insightful account of a pivotal moment in capitalism’s history.</p>
<p>She calls our attention to a pair of international conferences that were convened shortly after the end of the Great War to discuss the financial and economic challenges that confronted the combatant European nations. The League of Nations sponsored a conference in Brussels in 1920; another conference took place in Genoa in 1922 under the auspices of the Supreme Council of the Allies. Historians have generally regarded these conferences as failures because the participating delegates were unable to arrive at a concrete agreement for managing the problems posed by war debt and globally disordered balance of payments accounts. Mattei argues instead that the two conferences established the framework of the austerity agenda adopted throughout the capitalist world in subsequent decades: “The two conferences reunited the European establishment under the flag of technocracy to construct and implement austerity. Technocrats were rising as the new protectors of capitalism — and their sermon was heard loud and clear across the continent.”</p>
<p>The austerity gospel held that economic growth was driven not by the productive activity and spending of workers but by the virtuous abstinence of capitalists, whose savings were transformed into capital accumulation by the invisible hand of the market. National prosperity therefore required the redistribution of income away from workers and toward capitalists. Workers’ demands for higher wages and fewer hours had to be resisted. Public spending on health care, education, and social services had to be sharply curtailed because it drew financial resources away from capital accumulation. Government budgets needed to be balanced, and monetary policy needed to be tightened. The rhetoric adopted to support this agenda was at times alarmist; one of the documents issued by the Brussels conference contains this dire warning: “Any country which does not contrive as soon as possible to attain the execution of these principles is doomed beyond hope of recovery.”</p>
<p>Mattei identifies three kinds of austerity policies: fiscal austerity, monetary austerity, and industrial austerity — the “austerity trinity.” Fiscal austerity involves reducing government spending, particularly on programs aimed at providing social services and income support to working-class people; regressive taxation, aimed at buttressing the after-tax incomes of the propertied classes, is also part of the fiscal austerity mix. Monetary austerity entails restricting access to liquidity and credit when labor markets get tight and wages start to rise. Instead of letting the market adjust the price of labor in response to worker-friendly market conditions, the austerity credo requires that workers get knocked back into line by a state-generated recession.</p>
<p>Fiscal discipline and monetary restraint are what normally come to mind when we think of austerity. But Mattei reminds us that industrial austerity is an important part of the arsenal of the capitalist state. Industrial austerity is the weakening or abolition of laws and institutions that protect the interests of workers: right-to-work laws, lax enforcement of fair hiring rules, legislative impediments to the formation of labor unions, tolerance of noncompete clauses in labor contracts, and so forth. Cuts to unemployment benefits weaken the bargaining position of unemployed people relative to employers by reducing the amount of time an unemployed person can take to find a good job; such cuts would fall under the headings of both fiscal and industrial austerity. In the jargon of modern economics, industrial austerity is often characterized as enhancing “labor market flexibility.” A major aim of all austerity regimes is to break the back of organized labor, to neuter it and render it incapable of protecting workers.</p>
<p>A substantial portion of the book is devoted to detailed examinations of how austerity was implemented in Britain and Italy. Mattei shows that in both countries the enforcement of austerity was achieved by removing economic policymaking from democratic control. But the precise method by which democracy was sabotaged differed. In Britain, responsibility for economic decision-making was transferred to the Treasury and the Bank of England, institutions that were insulated from electoral accountability. The two institutions coordinated their activity closely to advance the austerity agenda.</p>
<p>In Italy, the Fascist government that came to power in 1922 imposed austerity largely by decree, and eliminated resistance through electoral fraud, disenfranchisement of the electorate, the imprisonment of political opponents, the suppression of press freedoms, and physical brutality — including political assassinations. Mattei’s point is that, notwithstanding their radical differences in approach, both countries relied upon antidemocratic strategies to execute their austerity agendas in the interwar period. She paints a vivid picture of the policies that were implemented and of the human wreckage they caused.</p>
<p>Mattei has unearthed a great deal of disturbing evidence regarding the state of mind of the advocates of austerity during the interwar period. One of the key players, the Italian economist Maffeo Pantaleoni, denounced workers as “violent, dishonest, and blackmailers of government” (in Mattei’s words) for threatening to strike; he contended that “wages were much higher than [workers’] marginal productivity”; and he endorsed the violent suppression of dissent, including the execution of communist leaders. The casualness with which British monetary economist Ralph G. Hawtrey and Treasury officials Basil Blackett and Otto Niemeyer — the three main architects of Britain’s austerity regime — discussed the suffering that austerity would inflict on working people is shocking in its callousness.</p>
<p>The Italian liberal economist and statesman Luigi Einaudi was never a Fascist and never held any position in a Fascist government; he was opposed to the political authoritarianism of Mussolini’s regime. But he was supportive of the austerity policies that the regime imposed, and he was willing to make his peace with authoritarianism for the sake of what he believed to be sound economic policy. British commentators expressed perfunctory disapproval of Mussolini’s brutality, but for the most part they were prepared to tolerate it as long as he put Italy’s economic affairs in order.</p>
<p>Austerity removes economic policymaking from democratic control and places it in the hands of technocrats or experts. A recurring theme in <em>The Capital Order</em> is the pernicious role of technocrats in the austerity project. “Austerity,” Mattei writes, “found its primary ally in technocracy — a belief in the power of economists as guardians of an indisputable science.” (She is, for example, highly critical of central bank independence, a principle that originated in Britain’s austerity initiative of the 1920s.) Her wariness appears to owe something to the liberatory philosophy of Antonio Gramsci, whose <em>Ordine Nuovo</em> movement</p>
<blockquote><p>stood fast on the idea that any approach to knowledge was inherently, deeply political, since the lens through which one looks at the world may foreclose or open spaces for imagination and thus establish if and what alternatives . . . are viable. While the predominant lens to interpret the world foreclosed imagination and nurtured acceptance of the capitalist order, the emancipatory lens opened up possibilities to envisage a different society.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mattei’s discussion of Gramsci and his circle is one of the highlights of the book. From a Gramscian perspective, technocrats and experts enforce a top-down conception of knowledge that, Mattei contends, inevitably serves the interests of the prevailing power structure.</p>
<p>There is no doubt a good deal of truth in this. Expertise is, in a certain sense, a bourgeois concept, a by-product of the ideological imperative to organize our lives and activities in a rational way. But it is difficult to see how any complex industrial society, including a socialist society, could do without technocrats. Think of the multitude of issues that the modern state must address: housing policy, trash removal, public health and sanitation, education, policing, the administration of justice, national defense, public transportation, airline safety, disaster relief. The list is endless. None of these issues can be managed effectively without experts who have reasonable latitude to exercise their judgment in the service of the common good. Admittedly, the common good is a slippery concept, but well-functioning polities manage to settle on some version of it that most of their inhabitants find acceptable. A well-functioning polity can also design institutions that ensure the democratic accountability of its technocrats.</p>
<p>In one respect, Mattei’s account could have done with a bit more nuance. Mainstream economics is not intrinsically reactionary. Some of the economists and officials discussed in her book merit scorn. Pantaleoni in particular comes across as an ideologue — and a nasty piece of work to boot. The Treasury officials Blackett and Niemeyer were middling economic thinkers at best, and they embraced their roles as “hired prizefighters of the bourgeoisie,” as Marx would put it. Others like Hawtrey, Einaudi, A. C. Pigou, and Gustav Cassel, whatever their ideological commitments (Pigou was a Fabian socialist), were trying to cope with an unprecedentedly difficult set of policy problems.</p>
<p>The Great War left the economies of Europe damaged and heavily indebted. The global financial system was one national default away from Armageddon. Austerity wasn’t the answer, but the economists can be forgiven for thinking the cataclysmic dissolution of capitalism would be disastrous for everyone. Cassel recognized the need for debt forgiveness in some cases, a view hardly consistent with a rigid commitment to austerity. Hawtrey urged the Federal Reserve to intervene aggressively to counteract the deflation that accompanied the Great Depression; a technocrat he may have been, but he was not an austerity ideologue.</p>
<p>John Maynard Keynes takes some lumps from Mattei because he paid little analytical attention to the exploitative nature of the wage relation — and perhaps also because his vision of the good society assigned a central role to technocrats. But he was no champion of austerity. Aside from mentioning it briefly in a footnote, Mattei doesn’t say anything about the famous Macmillan Committee, whose 1931 report, largely written by Keynes, was in effect an argument against full-on austerity.</p>
<p>There is more work to be done on the origins of modern austerity policy. But that work will certainly have to take as its starting point Clara Mattei’s illuminating and provocative book.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/10/water_nanoplastic_pollution/">https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/10/water_nanoplastic_pollution/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38938017">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>The average store-bought bottle of water contains somewhere in the neighborhood of 10 to 100 times more minute plastic particles than previously believed, judging from a study published this week.</p>
<p>We've long known about the presence of microplastic particles in bottled water and proliferating through nature, while nanoplastics (pieces less than a micron, or 0.001 mm) have been difficult to accurately measure. This is where boffins at the Columbia and Rutgers universities in the US come in with a newly developed microscopy technique to image some of the smallest plastic particles yet spotted in our water.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using a technique dubbed stimulated Raman scattering (SRS), the academics discovered an average of 240,000 plastic particles per litre of bottled water across three of the brands tested, with measurements ranging from 110,000 to 370,000 fragments per litre. This is, we're told, 10 to 100 times greater than earlier estimates. Around 90 percent of the particles detected using SRS qualified as nanoplastics, the rest being microplastics.</p>

    

<p>"It is not totally unexpected to find so much of this stuff," Columbia graduate student Naixin Qian, lead author of a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2300582121">PNAS-published paper</a> describing this study, <a href="https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2024/01/08/bottled-water-can-contain-hundreds-of-thousands-of-previously-uncounted-tiny-plastic-bits-study-finds/" rel="nofollow">explained</a>. "The idea is that the smaller things get, the more of them there are."</p>

        


        

<p>Previous studies of micro and nanoplastics in the water and food supply have <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/ftox.2023.1193386/full#:~:text=Laboratory%20studies%20have%20found%20that,al.%2C%202020)%2C%20growth" rel="nofollow">linked</a> them to reproductive abnormalities, increased mortality, oxidative stress and other biological harms to humans and other animals.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Taking a page from the AI training playbook</h3>
<p>The team developed SRS to overcome three hurdles found with other techniques used to measure plastic particles in water: Poor instrument resolution, poor detection sensitivity, and an inability to distinguish different types of plastic. According to the team, they've cleared all three hurdles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SRS works by shooting lasers at water samples to make specific molecules resonate and using software to identify plastic particles from those results. The team said they were able to train their SRS system to detect seven types of plastics with an identification rate of more than 96 percent and a false positive rate of just one percent, the team said. Speed of recognition was also not a problem.</p>
<p>"Compared to the traditional Raman technique which may need days to map a filter surface, SRS only needs several hours for a sample," Beizhan Yan, associate research professor at Columbia and one of the study's authors, told <em>The Register</em>.</p>
<h3>Plastics, plastics and more plastics</h3>
<p>While SRS has allowed the team to say with confidence that they've determined there are orders of magnitude more plastic in bottled water than previously believed, there's still a lot the study's method isn't able to detect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the paper, the software was only able to account for about 10 percent of the total particles imaged using SRS. The rest, said Yan, could be organic, or inorganic particles including plastics that weren't among the seven types the algorithm was trained to identify.&nbsp;</p>

</ul>
<p>For Yan, the biggest find by the study was "the variety of the plastic types and different size distributions" found in water samples.</p>
<p>"Previous studies found the major chemical composition to be PET, which is expected since the bottle is made of PET," Yan told us. "Therefore, for a long time, we had the impression that the majority of plastic particles inside bottled water would be Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) particles of a few hundred nanometers in size."</p>

        

<p>"That was incorrect," Yan said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ironically enough, the most commonly detected plastic was polyamide, a material commonly used in water filtration systems and "the most popular membrane material used in reverse osmosis … a common water purification method shared by all three brands [of water tested]," the team wrote in the paper.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The boffins hope that their ability to identify specific types of plastic particles present in water can help find sources of microplastic contamination. PET and PE, both commonly used in the plastic bottles used to hold water, were, as noted, found in the samples. Other polymers were also found in the bottles, but aren't part of the packaging process, hence a likely contamination source "before or during water production," the team said.&nbsp;</p>

        

<p>SRS could be tuned to similarly detect non-plastic particles in water, which Yan told us the team is working on. They also plan to use their SRS technique to analyze tap water for nanoplastic contamination, as well as air samples and biological tissues. ®</p>

<p>Does DNA have anything like IF-statements, GOTO-jumps, or WHILE loops?</p>

<p>In software development, these constructs have the following functions:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>IF-statements:</strong> An IF statement executes the code in a subsequent code block if some specific condition is met.</li>
<li><strong>WHILE-loops:</strong> The code in a subsequent code block is executes as many times as specified, or as long as a specific condition is met.</li>
<li><strong>Function calls:</strong> The code temporarily bypasses the subsequent code block, executing instead some other code block. After execution of the other code block the code returns (sometimes with some value) and continues the execution of the subsequent block.</li>
<li><strong>GOTO-statements:</strong> The code bypasses the subsequent code block, jumping instead directly to some other block.</li>
</ul>

<p>Are constructs similar to these present in DNA? If yes, how are they implemented and what are they called?</p>

<p>Biological examples similar to programming statements:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>IF</code> : Transcriptional activator; when present a gene will be transcribed. In general there is no termination of events unless the signal is gone; the program ends only with the death of the cell. So the <code>IF</code> statement is always a part of a loop.</li>
<li><code>WHILE</code> : Transcriptional repressor; gene will be transcribed until repressor is not present.</li>
<li>There are no equivalents of <code>function</code> calls. All events happen is the
same space and there is always a likelihood of interference. One can
argue that organelles can act as a compartment that may have a
<code>function</code> like properties but they are highly complex and are
not just some kind of input-output devices.</li>
<li><code>GOTO</code> is always dependent on a condition. This can happen in case of certain network connections such as feedforward loops and branched pathways. For example if there is a signalling pathway like this: <br> <strong>A → B → C</strong> and there is another connection <strong>D → C</strong> then if somehow <strong>D</strong> is activated it will directly affect <strong>C</strong>, making <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> dispensable. </li>
</ul>

<p>Logic gates have been constructed using synthetic biological circuits. See <a href="http://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v16/n3/abs/nrg3885.html" rel="noreferrer">this</a> review for more information. </p>

<hr>

<h2>Note</h2>

<p>Molecular biological processes cannot be directly compared to a computer code. It is the underlying logic that is important and not the statement construct itself and these examples should not be taken as absolute analogies. It is also to be noted that DNA is just a set of instructions and not really a fully functional entity (it is functional to some extent). However, even being just a code it is comparable to a HLL code that has to be compiled to execute its functions. See <a href="https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/29663/can-dna-rna-be-considered-as-natures-programming-language">this</a> post too.</p>

<p>It is also important to note that the cell, like many other physical systems, is analog in nature. Therefore, in most situations there is no 0/1 (binary) value of variables. Consider gene expression. If a transcriptional activator is present, the gene will be transcribed. However, if you keep increasing the concentration of the activator, the expression of that gene will increase until it reaches a saturation point. So there is no digital logic here. Having said that, I would add that switching behaviour is possible in biological systems (including gene expression) and is also used in many cases. Certain kinds of regulatory network structures can give rise to such dynamics. Co-operativity with or without positive feedback is one of the mechanisms that can implement switching behaviour.

<p>DNA is not analogous to computer code which renders your search for similar constructs in it meaningless. To give a couple of simple examples why this is:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Computer code has a sequential order of execution; DNA acts in
parallel and out of sequence, it is not "executed".</p></li>
<li><p>Computer code has a strict and consistent meaning so the line <code>if x==4 : x=7</code> always does the same thing; coding DNA
translates to amino acids and it's the complex chemical interactions
between these acids which give proteins their function thus no piece
of coding DNA can be understood outside of its protein.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Biological systems do have some pathways that operate in a similar way to computers, but you should be looking for these at the protein level not the DNA level and, even then, you need to be extremely careful that your analogy does not impair your understanding of what is really happening.</p>

<p>There are certainly some comparisons that could be made between the way genes are expressed from DNA and logic functions, but they aren't great.</p>

<p>But synthetic Biology is really a blossoming new field that is attempting to integrate logic functions into biology, see e.g. <a href="http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v31/n5/abs/nbt.2510.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer" title="Siuti et al. 2013. Synthetic circuits integrating logic and memory in living cells. Nature Biotechnology 31, 448–452. doi:10.1038/nbt.2510">Siuti et al (2013)</a>.</p>

<p>The above paper is a brilliant example of a group using bacteria to store information and assembling into biological circuits that can then be used to process logic functions. So its being done but not exactly in the way that you propose.</p>

<p>Just to add to previous answers, but <strong>transcriptional interference</strong> (see e.g. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2941638/">Shearwin et al., 2005</a>) can be seen as a form of IF-statement (or WHILE) in the sense that:</p>

<pre><code>if(x transcribed){not y transcribed}
</code></pre>

<p>The interference does not have to be binary though, and more common are graded responses. Transcriptional interference can also take place at the RNA stage (see e.g. <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v514/n7524/full/nature13671.html">Xue et al, 2014</a>), using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisense_RNA"><em>antisense RNA</em></a> and often providing a negative feedback loop, but the interference is then removed from the DNA, and does not represent a direct IF-statement analog at the DNA stage.</p>

<p>To me, GOTO mainly makes sense for sequential code execution, and this is not the case for DNA (lots of transcription is happening all the time in parallel). More generally, the parallel "execution" of DNA along with the continuous interactions and feedback loops between DNA, transcripts and proteins (among other things) also means that cellular processes are far less clear-cut and traceable than computer code, which means that computer code is a very poor metaphor for cellular processes and the functioning of DNA.</p>

<p>As WYSIWYG said there is no equivalent for function calls, as there will always be some interference. However one could argue that some modular pathways (eg. apoptosis signalling) can be seen as a "code block" where a certain input will (almost) certainly lead to a certain effect. The analogy with function calls is that, in describing many different mechanisms, it makes for shorter and more efficient "code" to consider everything between eg. caspase activation and cytochrome leakage as one block. Also, marking a protein with ubiquitin can maybe be seen as a function call for degradation.</p>

<p>I think that nuclear receptors are great examples of function calls. They hang out in the cytosol allowing normal programming to function in a normative fashion. Upon activation with their ligand, they translocate to the nucleus to activate subroutines of gene repression/activation and subsequent downstream processes. </p>

<p>In this fashion one could even argue that most initial ligand interactions that kick off cellular signaling are function calls. </p>

<p>In addition to the excellent WYSIWYG answer, there are some programming-like constructs at the lower level:</p>

<ul>
<li>FUNCTION CALL - replacing a single sub-unit inside a complex protein, assembled from multiple sub-units, each encoded by separate genes. This can also be seen as COMPOSITION, another programming concept.</li>

<p>The <b>British Post Office scandal</b> is a widespread and long-lasting series of individual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriages_of_justice" title="Miscarriages of justice">miscarriages of justice</a> which, between 1999 and 2015, involved over 700 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Office_Ltd#Services" title="Post Office Ltd">subpostmasters</a> being wrongly convicted of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft" title="Theft">theft</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_accounting" title="False accounting">false accounting</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud" title="Fraud">fraud</a> when shortfalls at their branches were in fact due to errors of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Office_Limited" title="Post Office Limited">Post Office</a>'s Horizon accounting software. In 2019, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Justice" title="High Court of Justice">High Court</a> ruled that the Horizon system was faulty and in 2020 the government established a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_inquiry" title="Public inquiry">public inquiry</a>. Courts began to quash convictions from 2010. As of January 2024, some victims are still fighting to have their convictions overturned and receive compensation, the public inquiry is ongoing, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Police" title="Metropolitan Police">Metropolitan Police</a> is investigating the Post Office for potential fraud offences.
</p><p>The Horizon accounting system was developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Computers_Limited" title="International Computers Limited">ICL Pathway</a>, owned by the Japanese company <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujitsu" title="Fujitsu">Fujitsu</a>. In 1999, the Post Office started to roll out the new software to its branch and sub-offices, the latter managed by subpostmasters on a self-employed basis under contracts with the Post Office. Almost immediately, some subpostmasters noticed the new system reporting false shortfalls, sometimes for thousands of pounds. The Post Office insisted that the system was robust and, when shortfalls occurred, prosecuted the subpostmasters or forced them to make up the amount. The impact of court cases, criminal convictions, imprisonment, loss of livelihood and homes, debt and bankruptcy took a heavy toll on victims and their families, leading to stress, illness, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce" title="Divorce">divorce</a> and, in at least four cases, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide" title="Suicide">suicide</a>. In May 2009, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Weekly" title="Computer Weekly">Computer Weekly</a> broke the story about problems with Horizon software and in September 2009 subpostmaster Alan Bates set up the Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance (JFSA). In 2012, as a result of pressure from campaigners and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members_of_Parliament_(United_Kingdom)" title="Members of Parliament (United Kingdom)">Members of Parliament</a>, the Post Office appointed forensic accountants Second Sight to conduct an investigation into Horizon. The investigators concluded that Horizon contained faults that could result in accounting discrepancies, but the Post Office insisted that there were no system-wide problems with the software.
</p><p>In 2019 a group of 555 subpostmasters led by Bates won a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_action#England_and_the_United_Kingdom" title="Class action">group action</a> brought in court against the Post Office, with the judge ruling that Horizon contained bugs, errors and defects. The Post Office agreed to settle out of court for £58 million. The subpostmasters' legal costs amounted to £47 million, leaving them with only about £20,000 each. The government later agreed to supplement the settlement, as they were excluded from the compensation scheme set up by the Post Office for other victims of the scandal. The first convictions to be quashed were those of six subpostmasters who had been convicted in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magistrates%27_court_(England_and_Wales)" title="Magistrates' court (England and Wales)">magistrates' courts</a> and whose appeals were heard at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwark_Crown_Court" title="Southwark Crown Court">Southwark Crown Court</a> in December 2020. In allowing the appeal by 39 subpostmasters in April 2021, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_of_Appeal_(England_and_Wales)" title="Court of Appeal (England and Wales)">Court of Appeal</a> judges ruled that in cases that relied on Horizon data a fair trial was not possible. Further appeal cases followed.
</p><p>In September 2020, the government established the <i>Post Office Horizon IT Inquiry</i>, chaired by retired judge <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyn_Williams" title="Wyn Williams">Sir Wyn Williams</a>, to look into the implementation and failings of the Horizon system that led to the prosecution of subpostmasters and termination of their contracts. Evidence was due to be heard from subpostmasters, the Post Office, UK Government Investment, the Department for Business and Trade, and others.
</p><p>A four-part television drama, <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Bates_vs_The_Post_Office" title="Mr Bates vs The Post Office">Mr Bates vs the Post Office</a></i>, was broadcast on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_(TV_network)" title="ITV (TV network)">ITV</a> in January 2024, after which the scandal became a major news story and political issue.

<p>Horizon is the outcome of the Pathway project, whose procurement process commenced in August 1994,<sup id="cite_ref-Beer-11Oct22_1-0"><a href="#cite_note-Beer-11Oct22-1">[1]</a></sup> and was announced by social security minister <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Lilley" title="Peter Lilley">Peter Lilley</a> at the 1995 Conservative Party conference.<sup id="cite_ref-Indie-1999-05-10_2-0"><a href="#cite_note-Indie-1999-05-10-2">[2]</a></sup> The goal was to computerise the payment of benefits at post offices, replacing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girocheque" title="Girocheque">Girocheques</a> and paper benefit books with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swipe_card" title="Swipe card">swipe cards</a>. It was thought this would reduce benefit fraud by £150<span>&nbsp;</span>million per year,<sup id="cite_ref-Indie-1999-05-10_2-1"><a href="#cite_note-Indie-1999-05-10-2">[2]</a></sup> at the same time as improving efficiency at post office counters, increasing footfall at small branches and enabling them to offer new services. The £1.5<span>&nbsp;</span>billion project was funded by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_finance_initiative" title="Private finance initiative">private finance initiative</a>; the successful bidder would develop the system and train some 70,000 Post Office staff to use it, and recover its costs from transaction-based charges.<sup id="cite_ref-Indie-1999-05-10_2-2"><a href="#cite_note-Indie-1999-05-10-2">[2]</a></sup>
</p><p>The contract to create the system for Post Office Counters Limited and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benefits_Agency" title="Benefits Agency">Benefits Agency</a> was awarded in May 1996 to ICL Pathway Limited,<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> a subsidiary created for the purpose in 1995 by British computer company <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Computers_Limited" title="International Computers Limited">ICL</a>, which was itself majority-owned by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujitsu" title="Fujitsu">Fujitsu</a> of Japan.<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>
</p><p>By 1998, the Pathway project was two years behind schedule, costs had increased, and there were concerns that magnetic swipe cards were becoming obsolete. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Blair_ministry" title="First Blair ministry">Labour</a> had come into power in 1997 and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Byers" title="Stephen Byers">Stephen Byers</a>, one of the responsible government ministers, later called the working relationships between the contracted parties "dysfunctional".<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> The government considered cancellation, but Fujitsu pressured the UK government to sign off on the IT system<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> and after lengthy negotiation it was agreed in May 1999 that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Social_Security_(United_Kingdom)" title="Department of Social Security (United Kingdom)">Department of Social Security</a> would withdraw and the benefit payment card would be abandoned.<sup id="cite_ref-Beer-11Oct22_1-1"><a href="#cite_note-Beer-11Oct22-1">[1]</a></sup> The project would continue with a reduced scope under the Horizon name at a cost of up to £900M, in order to replace the paper-based system used in post offices.<sup id="cite_ref-CW-Nov00_7-0"><a href="#cite_note-CW-Nov00-7">[7]</a></sup>
</p><p>In 1999, the Post Office commenced the roll-out of Horizon.<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> The roll-out reached 10,000 branches by August 2000,<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> and deployment to over 13,000 offices took place in 2000 and 2001.<sup id="cite_ref-CW-Nov00_7-1"><a href="#cite_note-CW-Nov00-7">[7]</a></sup> A precursor of the Horizon system had been rolled out to 300 post offices in 1995. At least two subpostmasters using the system were accused of fraud, but protests that the accounting problems were a "glitch in the system" were ignored.<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> By 2013, Horizon was used by at least 11,500 branches and was processing some six million transactions every day.<sup id="cite_ref-bugfound_11-0"><a href="#cite_note-bugfound-11">[11]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-B20210511_12-0"><a href="#cite_note-B20210511-12">[12]</a></sup> It cost over £1 billion to install and eventually affected 18,000 post offices throughout the UK.<sup id="cite_ref-Hansard_13-0"><a href="#cite_note-Hansard-13">[13]</a></sup>
</p><p>On 8 April 2021, after the problems had caused scandal, Post Office chief executive Nick Read announced that the Horizon system would be replaced by a new IT system that would be "more user-friendly, easier to adapt for new products and services, and cloud-based to ensure easy maintenance and ready interoperability with other systems". He said: "This will not be easy – it will after all be among the biggest, if not the biggest, IT roll-out in the country when the time comes. But the change is both necessary and overdue."<sup id="cite_ref-Read_14-0"><a href="#cite_note-Read-14">[14]</a></sup>
</p><p>It was a condition of the original settlement agreement in the group action that the Post Office would set up a historical shortfall scheme, to compensate subpostmasters who did not take part in the group action. The Post Office did so and it went on to attract more than 2,400 claims.<sup id="cite_ref-Slingo_15-0"><a href="#cite_note-Slingo-15">[15]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-independent.co.uk_16-0"><a href="#cite_note-independent.co.uk-16">[16]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-x23_17-0"><a href="#cite_note-x23-17">[17]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-x24_18-0"><a href="#cite_note-x24-18">[18]</a></sup> The scheme excluded the 555 subpostmasters who had successfully sued the post office.<sup id="cite_ref-x25_19-0"><a href="#cite_note-x25-19">[19]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Slingo_15-1"><a href="#cite_note-Slingo-15">[15]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-independent.co.uk_16-1"><a href="#cite_note-independent.co.uk-16">[16]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-x23_17-1"><a href="#cite_note-x23-17">[17]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-x24_18-1"><a href="#cite_note-x24-18">[18]</a></sup> As of February&nbsp;2022, no commitment to compensate those 555 subpostmasters existed.<sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-x25_19-1"><a href="#cite_note-x25-19">[19]</a></sup> On 22 March 2022, a government scheme was launched to compensate the 555 subpostmasters at the same level of compensation as other subpostmasters.<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup>

<p>Subpostmasters, who are self-employed and run branch post offices under contract to the Post Office,<sup id="cite_ref-:4_22-0"><a href="#cite_note-:4-22">[22]</a></sup> began to report balancing errors to the Post Office within weeks of the Horizon system being installed, via the helpline the subpostmasters were instructed to use.

<p>Second Sight issued an Interim Report dated 8 July 2013;<sup id="cite_ref-interimreport_31-0"><a href="#cite_note-interimreport-31">[31]</a></sup> a Briefing Report Part One dated 25 July 2014; a Briefing Report Part Two version 1 dated 21 August 2014; and a Briefing Report Part Two version 2 dated 9 April 2015.<sup id="cite_ref-briefingreport2_32-0"><a href="#cite_note-briefingreport2-32">[32]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-J6_33-0"><a href="#cite_note-J6-33">[33]</a></sup>
</p><p>In 2020, Vennells, who stood down from her Post Office role in 2019, said of the 2013 report that "it concluded, while it had not found evidence of system-wide problems with the Horizon software, there were specific areas where Post Office should consider its procedures and operational support for sub-postmasters".<sup id="cite_ref-vennells_letter_30-1"><a href="#cite_note-vennells_letter-30">[30]</a></sup> Ron Warmington of Second Sight had said in 2019 "if the Post Office Board had believed ... and acted on ... what Second Sight reported ... instead of being led by the nose by its own middle management and in-house and external legal advisors, huge amounts of money, and human suffering, would have been avoided".<sup id="cite_ref-breakshissilence_34-0"><a href="#cite_note-breakshissilence-34">[34]</a></sup> In July 2013, Second Sight issued an interim report and Post Office Ltd admitted that software defects with <i>Horizon</i> had indeed occurred, but said that the system was effective.

</p>
<blockquote><p>the Post Office has improperly enriched itself, through the decades, with funds that have passed through its own suspense accounts. Had its own staff more diligently investigated in order to establish who were the rightful owners of those funds, they would have been returned to them, whether they were Post Office's customers or its Subpostmasters. When is the Post Office going to return the funds that, in effect, belonged to its Subpostmasters? ... It also seems to be clear now that some of those funds could have been generated by Horizon itself, or by errors made by the Post Office's own staff, or by those of Fujitsu. They weren't "real" losses at all. They were phantom discrepancies.</p></blockquote>
<p>Second Sight's report of 9 April 2015, titled <i>Initial Complaint Review and Mediation Scheme</i> and marked as confidential, states that it was first appointed by Post Office at the request of members of parliament in July 2012.

It acted as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_prosecution#England_and_Wales" title="Private prosecution">private prosecutor</a> in England and Wales. In Scotland, it reported allegations of crime to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procurator_fiscal" title="Procurator fiscal">procurator fiscal</a>, and in Northern Ireland to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Prosecution_Service_for_Northern_Ireland" title="Public Prosecution Service for Northern Ireland">Public Prosecution Service</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-60"><a href="#cite_note-60">[60]</a></sup> The Post Office's unique position, with a history as a prosecutor going back to 1683, gave the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_Cases_Review_Commission" title="Criminal Cases Review Commission">Criminal Cases Review Commission</a> (CCRC) the greatest cause for concern upon its referral to the Court of Appeal.

</p><p>The Post Office is not a typical private prosecutor. The Private Prosecutors' Association questioned whether the Post Office was conducting private prosecutions at all and was in fact a "publicly-owned entity and a public prosecutor" during the relevant period. The CCRC, in its written submission to the Commons Select Committee, questioned whether any organisation with the Post Office's combined status, as victim, investigator and prosecutor, would be able to take decisions on investigations and disclosure "appropriately free from conflict of interest and conscious or unconscious bias".<sup id="cite_ref-62"><a href="#cite_note-62">[62]</a></sup> Counsel for the defence in the case of Misra <a href="#disclosure">raised the issues of insufficient disclosure</a>, conflict of interest, etc.

As the mediation process broke down, the affected subpostmasters began to consult and combine their efforts into legal action. The action taken against the Post Office took the form first of the group litigation in the name of <i>Bates and others</i>, a civil action in the High Court by some 600 people, and the linked appeal cases, first of <i>R v Christoper Trousdale &amp; Others</i> in the Crown Court, and then of <i>Hamilton and Others</i> in the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division). In the <i>Trousdale</i> and <i>Hamilton</i> appeals, the findings in the civil case (<i>Bates</i>) were used to support the appeals against convictions. In <i>Bates</i>, six 'lead claimants' and 23 'Common Issues' were identified and agreed to enable the court to examine the 600 cases. The court of appeal judgment,<sup id="cite_ref-EWCA_Crim_577_63-2"><a href="#cite_note-EWCA_Crim_577-63">[63]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 72, 127 &amp;137">: 72, 127 &amp;137 </span></sup> that all of the successful appeals had suffered a prosecution that was "an affront to the conscience of the court", has important implications for any future civil cases against the Post Office.<sup id="cite_ref-fiona1_76-0"><a href="#cite_note-fiona1-76">[76]</a></sup>

<blockquote><p>The recusal application was issued the day after Mr Godeseth's cross-examination had made it clear, not only that this remote access existed, but after he was taken in careful cross-examination through specific examples of Fujitsu personnel manipulating branch accounts, and leading to discrepancies in branch accounts. I am aware that criticism of the Post Office and Fujitsu in this respect may prove to be controversial, as earlier criticism of certain aspects of the Post Office's case in Judgment (No. 3) was not well received by it. However, if criticism is justified, I consider it would be detrimental to proper resolution of the group litigation if that criticism were to be withheld simply because it might lead to a further negative reaction by the Post Office. It is also an inherent part of the judicial function in any litigation to make findings, which may include criticisms where justified, that may be contrary to a litigant's own view of the merits of their case. Some litigants are so convinced of the righteousness of their own position that they consistently refuse to accept any possible view of the litigation other than their own. Such a blinkered view is rarely helpful, and would be particularly unhelpful from a publicly owned institution.</p></blockquote>

Kevin Jones MP replied, "If I had been the Minister, I would have had that person in and scrutinised what was going on ... That would certainly have applied in the past few months, given the hundreds of millions of pounds that have been spent defending the indefensible."

The Post Office is an arm's length organisation, but there seems to be no accountability ..."

<p>Of the evidence of one Post Office witness, the judge said, "The Post Office appears, at least at times, to conduct itself as though it is answerable only to itself. The statement that it is prepared to preserve documents – as though that were a concession – and the obdurate to accept the relevance of plainly important documents, and to refuse to produce them, is extremely worrying."<sup id="cite_ref-J3_96-3"><a href="#cite_note-J3-96">[96]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 523">: 523 </span></sup> Fraser said in the Horizon Issues trial,<sup id="cite_ref-J6_33-3"><a href="#cite_note-J6-33">[33]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 64.2">: 64.2 </span></sup>

<blockquote><p>the possibility of future (as opposed to current) criminal prosecutions, or the potentially criminal impact upon individual subpostmasters, did more than hover in the background to the Horizon Issues trial.

<p>The issuing by the Post Office of the recusal application on 21 March 2019 caused significant disruption to the Horizon Issues trial which had started on 11 March 2019, and to the Group Litigation as a whole. The subpostmasters applied for the costs of that application; the Post Office sought that the judge reserve costs, in the following terms:<sup id="cite_ref-J5_106-1"><a href="#cite_note-J5-106">[106]</a></sup>
</p>
<blockquote><p>the court can't be sure that things will happen in the future that will affect and alter its view about incidence of costs. It simply cannot do so.

<p>The judge was troubled by this submission. Inherent was a veiled or implied threat that the Post Office will say that the overall outcome of the litigation, or other future issues, has been decided. The Post Office was attempting to put the court <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_terrorem" title="In terrorem">in terrorem</a></i> again. After asserting no predecision he said, "I do nonetheless consider that it is appropriate that I consider whether to make a costs order now ..." After considering cases cited, the application by the Post Office to reserve costs was dismissed. "The claimants would not be on an equal footing with the Post Office, a publicly funded body, if I reserved the costs of the Common Issues trial until the very end of the litigation ... I do not however consider that the presence of litigation funding should sway this decision one way or the other. I agree with Mr Cavender that the presence of such funding should not put a claimant in a better position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the correct stage in litigation at which costs should be addressed, compared to a non-funded party. However, regardless of who is funding litigation, a funder or an individual litigant, cash flow is a relevant consideration for most litigants. It is a consideration that might weigh less heavily upon publicly funded bodies such as the Post Office, but even such entities are likely to be concerned to some extent with cash flow."<sup id="cite_ref-J5_106-2"><a href="#cite_note-J5-106">[106]</a></sup> Of the subpostmasters' submissions that their award of costs should not be reduced, the court rejected them.<sup id="cite_ref-J4_113-7"><a href="#cite_note-J4-113">[113]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-J5_106-3"><a href="#cite_note-J5-106">[106]</a></sup>

<p>This judgment concerns the operation and functionality of the Horizon system itself. The hearings took place in March, April, June and July 2019. The hearings were interrupted by the Post Office's application for the judge to recuse, to appeal his refusal to recuse (<a href="#Permission_to_appeal_Judgment_No_4_–_May_2019">judgment 4</a>), and his <a href="#Permission_to_appeal_Judgment_No_3_–_November_2019">judgment 3</a>.

</p><p>The important judgment was about whether the Horizon computer system worked and was "robust", which the Post Office said it was.

<p>Lord Justice Coulson refused permission to appeal judgment No 3 and handed down his written reasons on 22 November.<sup id="cite_ref-coulson2_117-0"><a href="#cite_note-coulson2-117">[117]</a></sup> Before dealing with the 26 grounds that formed the basis of the application the judge set out a number of reasons that he felt militated against granting the Post Office permission to appeal. In short, the judge said:
</p>
<ul><li>The trial was long and complex – 6 weeks – 60 lever arch files – 20 witnesses of fact. The judgment is 320 pages and 1,122 paragraphs long. No judge will ever know more about this case generally, and the Common Issues specifically, than Fraser J.</li>
<li>The oral hearing of the permission-to-appeal application had demonstrated the danger that consideration of one issue opened up another, and another until the trial is re-fought. That is manifestly not in the interests of justice.</li>
<li>Many of the Post Office's challenges are challenges to the findings of fact made by Fraser J. Challenges to such findings of fact are not open to an appellant in the position of the Post Office.<sup id="cite_ref-Fage_118-0"><a href="#cite_note-Fage-118">[118]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-119"><a href="#cite_note-119">[119]</a></sup> Fraser J's conclusions of law were so entangled with his findings of fact that Coulson LJ considered it neither just, nor practicable to endeavour to separate them out.</li>
<li>The Post Office made sweeping statements of the judgment which were demonstrably wrong. The Post Office takes findings "either wholly out of context, misstated, or otherwise not correctly summarised".</li>
<li>Fraser J dealt comprehensively with why he refused permission to appeal in his separate judgment of 17 June 2019 which itself runs to 91 paragraphs, and Coulson LJ said that he agreed with Fraser J's detailed reasons for refusing the application to appeal.</li>
<li>The Post Office's approach in this application was, as Fraser J correctly labelled it "attritional". The most obvious example is the Post Office's anxiety to state what they do not like about a particular proposal from the subpostmasters or the consequential finding by Fraser J, without providing any practical alternative. None of this engenders any confidence in the underlying merits or prospects of success of the Post Office's application for permission to appeal.</li>
<li>There is no greater or wider right to permission to appeal just because this is group litigation; indeed, from the point of view of practical justice the opposite may well be the case. In any event, the subpostmasters' contract was no longer in use.</li>
<li>This application is founded on the premise that the nation's most trusted brand was not obliged to treat their subpostmasters with good faith, and instead entitled to treat them in capricious or arbitrary ways which would not be unfamiliar to a mid-Victorian factory-owner (the Post Office's right to terminate contracts arbitrarily and the subpostmasters alleged strict liability to the Post Office for errors made by the Post Office's own computer system, being just two of many examples). Given the unique relationship that the Post Office has with its subpostmasters, that position was a startling starting point for any consideration of these grounds of appeal.<sup id="cite_ref-coulson2_117-1"><a href="#cite_note-coulson2-117">[117]</a></sup></li></ul>

"The CCRC referred the cases because it considered that two cogent lines of argument in relation to abuse of process were available to each appellant: first, that the reliability of Horizon data was essential to the prosecution and conviction, and it was not possible for the trial process to be fair; and secondly, that it was an affront to the public conscience for the appellant to face criminal proceedings."<sup id="cite_ref-EWCA_Crim_577_63-4"><a href="#cite_note-EWCA_Crim_577-63">[63]</a></sup> Each of the forty-two cases was considered individually. Of the forty-two, just two had previously appealed, unsuccessfully.
</p><p>The Post Office accepted Fraser's findings of the unreliability of the Horizon systems and, in some cases, of inadequate investigation, and/or of insufficient disclosure. In these cases, the Post Office did not resist the appeal on Ground 1 but it would oppose Ground 2. The Post Office divided the appellants into three groups; A, 4 cases where it asserted that both categories 1 and 2 abuse of process applied, group B, 35 cases where category 1 applied, but not category 2, and group C, where neither category applied. The Post Office would not seek a retrial of any appellant whose appeal is allowed.

That hearing led to further hearings in November, December, and January. The court addressed three issues:
</p>
<ul><li>information from Brian Altman QC, counsel for Post Office, alleging potential contempt of court by Ms Page, junior counsel for three appellants (all in group B), by improper disclosure of the 'Clarke advice';</li>
<li>"the issue of whether an appellant whose appeal was not resisted by POL on Ground 1 was entitled to argue Ground 2;"<sup id="cite_ref-EWCA_Crim_577_63-6"><a href="#cite_note-EWCA_Crim_577-63">[63]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 79">: 79 </span></sup></li>
<li>an application by journalist Nick Wallis for the release of the 'Clarke advice'. Mr Wallis' application failed.</li></ul>
<p>Mr Altman's information to the court on 19 November led to hearings on 3 December 10 December and 15 January before the present court, and to Marshall and Page resigning from the case. On 3 December, Altman said, "I am confident that the court understands why we brought these matters to the court's attention. ... For the avoidance of any doubt, I should like to make clear that the Post Office has not made application for anyone's committal for contempt. ... We have sought to assist the court as we were invited to do," referring to signed undertakings, "... the court suggested that all legal representatives sign an express undertaking not to use disclosed material other than for the proper conduct of these proceedings." Lord Justice Holroyde interjected, "I thought you suggested that," and Altman replied, "Ultimately, my Lord, I think it was at the suggestion of the court but that is what has happened and that is what has been done."<sup id="cite_ref-auto_128-0"><a href="#cite_note-auto-128">[128]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 137–141">: 137–141 </span></sup>

By 4 December, barristers Paul Marshall and Fiona Page had resigned from the Hamilton case. Mr Marshall had written two letters to the court. Of the second, Nick Wallis said, "It makes for troubling reading."<sup id="cite_ref-x258_126-1"><a href="#cite_note-x258-126">[126]</a></sup> In April 2021, the matter came before <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Fulford" title="Adrian Fulford">Lord Justice Fulford</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_High_Court_judges_of_England_and_Wales" title="List of High Court judges of England and Wales">Mrs Justice Cutts</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_High_Court_judges_of_England_and_Wales" title="List of High Court judges of England and Wales">Mr Justice Saini</a> when it was declared no further action to be taken.

It would be wrong in principle for the court to permit the respondent (the Post Office) effectively to preclude argument on Ground 2 by its concession that Ground 1 is not opposed. ... The appellants have suffered very severely as a consequence of their prosecutions, and a finding in their favour on Ground 1 alone would not fully vindicate them. ...

In the event, each appellant did wish to do so."<sup id="cite_ref-EWCA_Crim_577_63-8"><a href="#cite_note-EWCA_Crim_577-63">[63]</a></sup> The court set out its reasoning and highlighted four factors of particular importance:<sup id="cite_ref-can_we_judgement_64-3"><a href="#cite_note-can_we_judgement-64">[64]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-4_WLR_115_65-3"><a href="#cite_note-4_WLR_115-65">[65]</a></sup>
</p>
<ol><li>abuse of court process is an important matter to the parties and the public, notwithstanding that the appellants had not previously applied for leave to appeal.</li>
<li>Ground 1 presupposes that there should be a prosecution.

<li>Fourthly, we do not accept the submissions that consideration of Ground 2 will cause undue delay in the determination of these appeals.</li></ol>
<p>At the April hearings, after considering the submissions of the subpostmasters and the Post Office, the court stated, "In those circumstances, we are satisfied that a fair trial was not possible in any of the 'Horizon cases' and that Ground 1 accordingly succeeds in each of those cases."<sup id="cite_ref-EWCA_Crim_577_63-9"><a href="#cite_note-EWCA_Crim_577-63">[63]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 126">: 126 </span></sup> The court then set out its reasoning in respect of Ground 2.

The first public hearing session took place on 15 January 2021.<sup id="cite_ref-146"><a href="#cite_note-146">[146]</a></sup> The Justice For subpostmasters Alliance (JFSA) refused to take part in the inquiry, described it as a whitewash and called for a full public inquiry.<sup id="cite_ref-147"><a href="#cite_note-147">[147]</a></sup>
</p><p>Dr Neil Hudgell, of solicitors for subpostmasters said, "Now Post Office officials must face criminal investigation for maliciously ruining lives by prosecuting innocent people in pursuit of profits," and called for the prime minister to convene a judge-led inquiry.<sup id="cite_ref-148"><a href="#cite_note-148">[148]</a></sup> After the subpostmasters' successful appeals on both grounds 1 and 2 abuse of process, in an article headed "Calls grow for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solicitors_Regulation_Authority" title="Solicitors Regulation Authority">SRA</a> and police to investigate Post Office lawyers", Hudgell is quoted as saying the Post Office engaged in "legal gymnastics to seek to persuade the court away from finding a clear systematic abuse of process of the criminal law." In the same article, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Moorhead" title="Richard Moorhead">Richard Moorhead</a>, professor of law and professional ethics at Exeter Law School, said "the SRA and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_Standards_Board" title="Bar Standards Board">BSB</a> should investigate whether anyone should be held to account amid professional concerns about who was responsible for disclosure issues."<sup id="cite_ref-lg26Apr_71-1"><a href="#cite_note-lg26Apr-71">[71]</a></sup> Solicitors for subpostmasters wrote to the government (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Business,_Energy_%26_Industrial_Strategy" title="Department for Business, Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy">DBEIS</a>) asking it to re-establish the inquiry on a statutory footing and to consult again on the terms of reference. "The department should be called as witnesses under oath, not have effective control of the inquiry," ... "The Post Office wrongly prosecuted so many upstanding pillars of the community and its owners want to mark (their) own homework – that is unconscionable."<sup id="cite_ref-149"><a href="#cite_note-149">[149]</a></sup>
</p><p>On 19 May 2021, the government announced that an extended, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquiries_Act_2005" title="Inquiries Act 2005">statutory inquiry</a> into the computer scandal would deliver its conclusions in autumn 2022. Witnesses could now be compelled to give evidence. Mr Scully said he and Sir Wyn had agreed that the context of the events had changed after convictions were quashed and hundreds more were expected to follow. Boris Johnson said:<sup id="cite_ref-wyn_statut_150-0"><a href="#cite_note-wyn_statut-150">[150]</a></sup>
</p>
<blockquote><p>We must stand with postmasters to get to the bottom of what went wrong in the Post Office Horizon IT dispute. I heard first-hand the irreparable impact it has had on their lives. That's why, in light of the recent Court of Appeal judgment, we're stepping up our independent inquiry by putting it on a statutory footing, so we can get the answers they deserve.</p></blockquote>

<p>On 19 May 2021, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyn_Williams" title="Wyn Williams">Wyn Williams</a> said that in the following weeks, the inquiry would produce a statement of approach and that, in September 2021, a further statement of approach would set out all relevant details.<sup id="cite_ref-wyn1_151-0"><a href="#cite_note-wyn1-151">[151]</a></sup>
</p><p>On 28 July, the government (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Business,_Energy_%26_Industrial_Strategy" title="Department for Business, Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy">DBEIS</a>) issued its fourth statement of approach, which included the inquiry terms of reference. After setting out preliminary and organisational matters – the appointment of solicitors and counsel to the inquiry – establishment of a website and of premises, etc., the statement set out terms of reference, in essence:
</p>
<dl><dd>A: Understand and acknowledge what went wrong and key lessons that must be learned.</dd>
<dd>B: Obtain all available relevant evidence from the Post Office, Fujitsu, BEIS and UKGI to establish the failings of Horizon and the Post Office's use of information from Horizon.</dd>
<dd>C: Assess whether the Post Office has learned and has delivered or made good progress on the changes necessary.</dd>
<dd>D: Assess whether the commitments made by Post Office Ltd have been properly delivered.</dd>
<dd>E: Assess whether processes and information provided by the Post Office to postmasters are sufficient.</dd>
<dd>F: Examine the historical and current governance and whistleblowing controls are now sufficient to ensure that these failures do not happen again.</dd></dl>
<blockquote><p>"The Inquiry will consider only those matters set out in the preceding sections A-F. The Inquiry will not consider any issue which is outside the scope of the powers conferred upon the Inquiry by the Inquiries Act 2005. The Horizon group damages settlement (albeit the Inquiry may examine the events leading to the settlement), and/or the engagement or findings of any other supervisory or complaints mechanisms, including in the public sector, are outside the Inquiry's scope."<sup id="cite_ref-152"><a href="#cite_note-152">[152]</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p>During the non-statutory inquiry, two public hearings were held in early 2021. A preliminary hearing on the provisional List of Issues was held on 8 November 2021. The Human Impact Hearings opened on 14 February 2022, at Juxon House, in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_London" title="City of London">City of London</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-153"><a href="#cite_note-153">[153]</a></sup> The Phase Two hearings, covering the Horizon IT System procurement, design, pilot, roll out and modifications, started in October 2022.<sup id="cite_ref-154"><a href="#cite_note-154">[154]</a></sup> They were streamed online, as are the later phases of the inquiry.<sup id="cite_ref-155"><a href="#cite_note-155">[155]</a></sup>
</p><p>
Richard Moorhead, professor of law and professional ethics, University of Exeter, made written and oral submissions to the Williams inquiry. Moorhead, in an oral submission to the Williams inquiry, said:<sup id="cite_ref-Moohead_oral_156-0"><a href="#cite_note-Moohead_oral-156">[156]</a></sup></p><blockquote><p>If I can end by putting the case metaphorically for a moment. Considering the Horizon saga without considering the lawyering, and without lifting professional privilege, would be a bit like considering Watergate without considering the White House Tapes. Essential, telling, [and] perhaps vital information will be missing. The abuse of power, the injustice, who did it and why, will not be properly understood. Sir, you must, to discharge the Inquiry's remit, you must do the equivalent of listening to the tapes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Immediately after the November hearing, Williams said he would ask Post Office Limited, IT supplier Fujitsu, the Department for Business, Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy and the UK government to waive privilege in respect of material relevant to the inquiry's terms of reference, and he set a deadline for response.<sup id="cite_ref-157"><a href="#cite_note-157">[157]</a></sup> On 16 November, Wyn Williams reported that all four parties had responded within the timescale specified and added "The response of POL, on any view, goes a very long way towards meeting the request I made of them. It is clear to me that in respect of many of the most crucial lines of investigation for the Inquiry POL has waived legal professional privilege."<sup id="cite_ref-158"><a href="#cite_note-158">[158]</a></sup> The Post Office published its response to the request on 15 November 2021.<sup id="cite_ref-159"><a href="#cite_note-159">[159]</a></sup> Government (BEIS) said that it was its "firm position that the inquiry should not be obstructed by the assertion of legal privilege", but the government-owned Post Office was more cautious. It agreed to a limited waiver over relevant material but would maintain privilege over documents relevant to ongoing litigation/remediation activities. The Post Office maintained privilege over documents relevant to the ongoing group litigation claim in the Employment Tribunal. It maintained privilege over legal advice related to the Historical Shortfall Scheme and to current and anticipated claims from individuals whose criminal convictions have been or will be quashed. This could have wide-reaching ramifications for the inquiry; if advice is withheld on the basis that it is relevant to current and anticipated claims from those who have had their convictions quashed, this may lead to gaps in the inquiry.<sup id="cite_ref-160"><a href="#cite_note-160">[160]</a></sup>
</p><p>On 13 February 2022, in a report prior to the start of the Wyn Williams hearings, the BBC quoted a prosecuted, jailed and subsequently cleared subpostmaster: "I want someone else to be charged and jailed like I was." This request was later repeated by several other subpostmasters.<sup id="cite_ref-161"><a href="#cite_note-161">[161]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-162"><a href="#cite_note-162">[162]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-163"><a href="#cite_note-163">[163]</a></sup>
</p><p>The inquiry issued an interim report on 17 July 2023. The recommendations were as follows:<sup id="cite_ref-164"><a href="#cite_note-164">[164]</a></sup>
</p>
<ul><li>The Horizon Compensation Advisory Board (HCAB) should not be prevented from monitoring individual cases</li>
<li>HCAB shall produce written reports in respect of each of their meetings</li>
<li>Membership of HCAB should be increased to ensure that it has sufficient capacity</li>
<li>The Government should within 28 days seek directions under section 306 of the Insolvency Act 1986 to ensure that compensation payable to bankrupt claimants is not diverted to insolvency practitioners</li>
<li>The government should publish proposals for ensuring that applicants to all schemes are treated equally and fairly</li>
<li>The government should ensure that legislation is enacted to allow compensation under group litigation orders to be made to applicants after midnight on 7 August 2024</li>
<li>No applications for compensation to the Horizon Shortfall Scheme should be entertained after such date as agreed by the minister</li></ul>
<p>The government accepted the recommendations in full or in part on 26 October 2023.<sup id="cite_ref-165"><a href="#cite_note-165">[165]</a></sup>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><h2 id="intro">
  Intro
  <a href="#intro">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Vcc - the Vulkan Clang Compiler, is a proof-of-concept C and C++ compiler for Vulkan leveraging Clang as a front-end, and <a href="https://github.com/Hugobros3/shady">Shady</a> our own research IR and compiler. Unlike other shading languages, Vcc aims to stick closely to standard C/C++ languages and merely adds a few new intrinsics to cover GPU features. Vcc is similar to CUDA or Metal in this regard, and aims to bring the advantages of standard host languages to Vulkan shaders<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p><img src="https://shady-gang.github.io/vcc/vcc.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="key-features">
  Key Features
  <a href="#key-features">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Vcc supports advanced C/C++ features usually left out of shading languages such as HLSL or GLSL, in particular raising the bar when it comes to pointer support and control-flow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unrestricted pointers
<ul>
<li>Arithmetic is legal, they can be bitcasted to and from integers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Generic pointers
<ul>
<li>Generic pointers do not have an address space in their type, rather they carry the address space as a tag in the upper bits.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>True function calls
<ul>
<li>Including recursion, a stack is implemented to handle this in the general case</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Function pointers
<ul>
<li>Lets you write code in a functional style on the GPU without limitations</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Arbitrary <code>goto</code> statements - code does not need to be strictly structured !</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of these capabilities are present in compute APIs, but are not supported in most graphics APIs such as DirectX or Vulkan. We aim to address this gap by proving these features can and should implemented. <a href="https://shady-gang.github.io/vcc/why">More on why we think that’s important</a></p>
<h2 id="status-and-caveats">
  Status and Caveats
  <a href="#status-and-caveats">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Vcc is still a work-in-progress. While we do commit to making all the previously mentioned features work reliably, and generally attempt to bring the entirety of C and C++ to the GPU without sub-setting, there are still limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Certain functions, such as <code>malloc</code>/<code>free</code> require communicating with the host kernel which we currently do not implement.</li>
<li>Non header-only libraries, including parts of the C and C++ standard libraries, will not work on the GPU without additional work, because of the way Vcc works.
<ul>
<li>While addressable, this would massively increase the scope of the project.</li>
<li>For now it’s best to think of Vcc as only supporting a <code>-ffreestanding</code> dialect of C/C++</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>C++ exceptions and their corresponding LLVM instructions (<code>landingpad</code> etc) are not supported.</li>
<li>Function and data pointers are not portable between host and device. Taking addresses and passing them across in either direction is UB - since Vulkan lacks a unified addressing extension this is a limitation we cannot address at this time.</li>
</ul>

                            <p>[update] I'm on some list now that I have written an article about some kind of "bomb", ain't I?</p>
<hr>
<p>If you have ever hosted a website or even administrated a server you'll be very well aware of bad people <em>trying</em> bad things with your stuff.</p>
<p>When I first hosted my own little linux box with SSH access at age 13 I read through the logs daily and report the IPs (mostly from China and Russia) who tried to connect to my sweet little box (which was actually an old ThinkPad T21 with a broken display running under my bed) to their ISPs.</p>
<p>Actually if you have a linux server with SSH exposed you can see how many connection attempts are made every day:</p>
<pre><code>grep 'authentication failures' /var/log/auth.log</code></pre>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.pictshare.net/u1ath9io4n.jpg"><figcaption>Hundreds of failed login attempts even though this server has disabled password authentication and runs on a non-standard port</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Wordpress has doomed us all</h2>
<p>Ok to be honest, web vulnerability scanners have existed before Wordpress but since WP is so widely deployed most web vuln scanners include scans for some misconfigured wp-admin folders or unpatched plugins.</p>
<p>So if a small, new hacking group wants to gain some hot cred they'll download <a href="https://wpscan.org/">one</a> of <a href="https://github.com/sullo/nikto">these</a> scanner <a href="http://rgaucher.info/beta/grabber/">things</a> and start testing against many websites in hopes of gaining access to a site and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website_defacement">defacing</a> it.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.pictshare.net/8c7cbrxql5.jpg"><figcaption>Sample of a log file during a scan using the tool Nikto</figcaption></figure>
<p>This is why all server or website admins have to deal with gigabytes of logs full with scanning attempts. So I was wondering..</p>
<h2>Is there a way to strike back?</h2>
<p>After going through some potential implementations with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrusion_detection_system">IDS</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail2ban">Fail2ban</a> I remembered the old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_bomb">ZIP bombs</a> from the old days.</p>
<h2>WTH is a ZIP bomb?</h2>
<p>So it turns out ZIP compression is really good with repetitive data so if you have a really huge text file which consists of repetitive data like all zeroes, it will compress it really good. Like REALLY good.</p>
<p>As <a href="http://www.unforgettable.dk/">42.zip</a> shows us it can compress a 4.5 peta byte (4.500.000  giga bytes) file down to 42 kilo bytes. When you try to actually look at the content (extract or decompress it) then you'll most likely run out of disk space or RAM.</p>
<h2>How can I ZIP bomb a vuln scanner?</h2>
<p>Sadly, web browsers don't understand ZIP, but they do understand GZIP.</p>
<p>So firstly we'll have to create the 10 giga byte GZIP file filled with zeroes. We could make multiple compressions but let's keep it simple for now.</p>
<pre><code>dd if=/dev/zero bs=1M count=10240 | gzip &gt; 10G.gzip</code></pre>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.pictshare.net/es8b6god0j.jpg"><figcaption>Creating the bomb and checking its size</figcaption></figure>
<p>As you can see it's 10 MB large. We could do better but good enough for now.</p>
<p>Now that we have created this thing, let's set up a PHP script that will deliver it to a client.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php
//prepare the client to recieve GZIP data. This will not be suspicious
//since most web servers use GZIP by default
header("Content-Encoding: gzip");
header("Content-Length: ".filesize('10G.gzip'));
//Turn off output buffering
if (ob_get_level()) ob_end_clean();
//send the gzipped file to the client
readfile('10G.gzip');</code></pre>
<p>That's it!</p>
<p>So we could use this as a simple defense like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php
$agent = filter_input(INPUT_SERVER, 'HTTP_USER_AGENT');

//check for nikto, sql map or "bad" subfolders which only exist on wordpress
if (strpos($agent, 'nikto') !== false || strpos($agent, 'sqlmap') !== false || startswith($url,'wp-') || startswith($url,'wordpress') || startswith($url,'wp/'))
{
      sendBomb();
      exit();
}

function sendBomb(){
        //prepare the client to recieve GZIP data. This will not be suspicious
        //since most web servers use GZIP by default
        header("Content-Encoding: gzip");
        header("Content-Length: ".filesize('10G.gzip'));
        //Turn off output buffering
        if (ob_get_level()) ob_end_clean();
        //send the gzipped file to the client
        readfile('10G.gzip');
}

function startsWith($a, $b) { 
    return strpos($a, $b) === 0;
}</code></pre>
<p>This script obviously is not - as we say in Austria - the yellow of the egg, but it can defend from script kiddies I mentioned earlier who have no idea that all these tools have parameters to change the user agent.</p>
<h3>Sooo. What happens when the script is called?</h3>
