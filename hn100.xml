                                        <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court">Supreme Court</a></span> is allowing a multibillion-dollar class action investors’ lawsuit to proceed against Facebook parent <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/meta-platforms-inc">Meta</a></span>, stemming from the privacy scandal involving the <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-steve-bannon-technology-lawsuits-campaigns-9a8b7633eb11d08d0a58a45b7dab1770">Cambridge Analytica</a></span> political consulting firm.</p><p>The justices heard arguments in November in Meta’s bid to shut down the lawsuit.

<p>Meta spokesman Andy Stone said the company was disappointed by the court’s action. “The plaintiff’s claims are baseless and we will continue to defend ourselves as this case is considered by the District Court,” Stone said in an emailed statement.</p>



<p> Meta already has paid a $5.1 billion fine and reached a $725 million privacy settlement with users.</p><div data-module="" data-gtm-region="What to know about Trump's second term: Staffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked for key positions so far.

<p>Cambridge Analytica had ties to Trump political strategist <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/steve-bannon">Steve Bannon</a></span>. It had paid a Facebook app developer for access to the personal information of about 87 million Facebook users. That data was then used to target U.S. voters during the 2016 campaign.</p>
    
    
    
<p>The lawsuit is one of two high court cases involving class-action lawsuits against tech companies. The justices also are wrestling with whether to shut down a class action against <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/nvidia-market-value-stock-price-revenue-chips-fe1d0d081191d5168332bf1c9ea3b85f">Nvidia</a></span>. Investors say the company misled them about its dependence on selling computer chips for the mining of volatile cryptocurrency. </p>

Many guides stop here, but there's room for improvement! Right now, our glass looks flat and boring. Real glass has an interesting visual character around its edges that we're missing. Let's bring that to life.</p><h4>Edges</h4><p>First we'll add edges to our glass. Others, like<!-- --> <a href="https://css.glass/">css.glass</a>, do this using<!-- --> <span><span>border</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>px</span><span> solid</span></span>. Borders affect the element's size and how it interacts with children. I prefer using<!-- --> <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow"><span><span>box-shadow</span><span>:</span><span> inset</span></span></a>. By using <span><span>box-shadow</span><span>:</span><span> inset</span></span> the children seamlessly fill the content area of the glass without negative<!-- --> <span><span>margin</span></span>s or other magic. This allows them to behave like decals applied to the glass surface.</p><p><span><span>box-shadow</span></span> requires at least two size values and supports up to four. The first two define the shadow's x and y offsets. To mimic the edges of glass, we use two translucent white<!-- --> <span><span>box-shadow</span></span>s.</p><p>The first shadow represents the edge of the glass as seen from outside. In our example this appears along the bottom and left edges. The second shadow represents the edge as seen through the glass. In our example this appears along the top and right edges.</p><p>Since light diminishes when viewing the edge through the glass, the top and left edges are softer and more translucent compared to the bottom and right edges. This subtle difference creates the illusion that the glass is slightly elevated at the bottom-right corner.</p><div><pre>1

Subsurface scattering refers to the way light disperses within a translucent surface. For glass, this is most noticable around the edges.</p><p>We will use <span><span>box-shadow</span><span>:</span><span> inset</span></span> to simulate this effect.

But another key characteristic of glass is its ability to <i>reflect</i> light off its surface. This reflective quality is the secret sauce to give our glass a distinctive look from other HTML glass examples.</p><h4>Rays of Light</h4><p>We'll blend in a image of light rays to create this effect. If you're interested in creating a similar image yourself, there are plenty of tutorials online. Here's one from<!-- --> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwgkK6PUkQ4">YouTube</a>, and here's<!-- --> <a href="https://phlearn.com/tutorial/light-rays-levels-photoshop/">a detailed textual walkthrough</a> <!-- -->if you prefer that approach. Alternatively, you can use download and use these light rays I created:</p><p><img src="https://www.tyleo.com/img/light-f71eeaec.png"></p><p>We'll explore a few ways to blend this image into the background. The first is to set it as the <span><span>background-image</span></span> of our glass element. Doing this directly on the element causes the<!-- --> <span><span>box-filter</span></span> to blur the<!-- --> <span><span>background-image</span></span>—we don't want that. Instead, we can apply the <span><span>background-image</span></span> to a pseudo child element using<!-- --> <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::before"><span><span>:</span><span>:</span><span>before</span></span></a>.</p><div><pre>1

In reality, moving glass through light creates dynamic reflections as the light shifts across the glass surface. Unfortunately, replicating this effect across all browsers is challenging. To address this, we'll explore two solutions: a pure CSS approach that works on most platforms except mobile, and a CSS + JavaScript solution which works everywhere.</p><p>The CSS solution is satisfyingly simple. We just add<!-- --> <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-attachment"><span><span>background-attachement</span><span>:</span><span> fixed</span></span></a> <!-- -->to our <span><span>:</span><span>:</span><span>before</span></span> element.</p><div><pre>1

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-section="cdc_news_body" id="content">
	<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed a human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) (H5N1 bird flu) in a child in California. This is the first reported avian influenza H5 virus infection in a child in the United States. Consistent with previously identified human cases in the United States, the child reportedly experienced mild symptoms and received flu antivirals. There were low levels of viral material detected in the initial specimen collected, and follow-up testing of the child several days later was negative for H5 bird flu but was positive for other common respiratory viruses. The child is recovering from their illness. An investigation by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) into the child's possible H5N1 exposure source is ongoing. </p>
<p>During CDPH's investigation, all household members reported having symptoms and specimens were collected from those people. All test results from members of the household were negative for H5 bird flu, and some family members were positive for the same common respiratory viruses as the child. Contact tracing continues, but there is currently no evidence of person-to-person spread of H5N1 bird flu from this child to others. To date, there has been no person-to-person spread identified associated with any of the H5N1 bird flu cases reported in the United States.</p>
<p>This case was detected through influenza testing and reported to CDPH through influenza surveillance. This is the second U.S. case identified through national surveillance. CDC continues to closely monitor available data from <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/">influenza surveillance systems</a>, particularly in states affected by outbreaks in animals, including California, where widespread outbreaks of H5N1 bird flu have been detected in wild birds and domestic poultry since 2022 and dairy herds since August 2024 in that state.</p>
<p>Limited and sporadic human infections with avian influenza H5N1 virus, where animal exposure was not identified, are very uncommon but have occurred, primarily in countries other than the United States. These instances underscore the importance of ongoing surveillance and investigations at the local, state, and Federal levels. Including this most recent case, 55 human cases of H5 bird flu have now been reported in the United States during 2024, with 29 in California. </p>
<p>CDC's risk assessment for the general public is low. However, people with exposure to infected or potentially infected animals, such as birds, dairy cattle, or other animals (including livestock), or to environments contaminated by infected birds or other animals, are at higher risk of infection. CDC recommends avoiding unprotected exposures to sick or dead animals, including wild birds, poultry, other domesticated birds, and other wild or domesticated animals (including cows).</p>
<p>CDC will continue to provide updates as additional information becomes available. For more information, read California's statement <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR24-037.aspx" rel="noreferrer" data-domain-ext="gov">State Reports Single, Possible Case of Bird Flu Virus in Child with Mild Symptoms<span aria-label=" external icon" role="img"></span></a></p>

<p dir="auto">The following packages are needed to run bocker.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>btrfs-progs</li>
<li>curl</li>
<li>iproute2</li>
<li>iptables</li>
<li>libcgroup-tools</li>
<li>util-linux &gt;= 2.25.2</li>
<li>coreutils &gt;= 7.5</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Because most distributions do not ship a new enough version of util-linux you will probably need to grab the sources from <a href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/v2.25/" rel="nofollow">here</a> and compile it yourself.</p>
<p dir="auto">Additionally your system will need to be configured with the following:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>A btrfs filesystem mounted under <code>/var/bocker</code></li>
<li>A network bridge called <code>bridge0</code> and an IP of 10.0.0.1/24</li>
<li>IP forwarding enabled in <code>/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward</code></li>
<li>A firewall routing traffic from <code>bridge0</code> to a physical interface.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">For ease of use a Vagrantfile is included which will build the needed environment.</p>
<p dir="auto">Even if you meet the above prerequisites you probably still want to <strong>run bocker in a virtual machine</strong>. Bocker runs as root and among other things needs to make changes to your network interfaces, routing table, and firewall rules. <strong>I can make no guarantees that it won't trash your system</strong>.</p>

              <p>What appears to be evidence of some of the oldest alphabetic writing in human history is etched onto finger-length, clay cylinders excavated from a tomb in Syria by a team of Johns Hopkins University researchers.</p>

<p>The writing, which is dated to around 2400 BCE, precedes other known alphabetic scripts by roughly 500 years, upending what archaeologists know about where alphabets came from, how they are shared across societies, and what that could mean for early urban civilizations, according to the researchers.</p>

<p>"Alphabets revolutionized writing by making it accessible to people beyond royalty and the socially elite. Alphabetic writing changed the way people lived, how they thought, how they communicated," said <a href="https://neareast.jhu.edu/directory/glenn-m-schwartz/">Glenn Schwartz</a>, a professor of archaeology at Johns Hopkins University who discovered the clay cylinders. "And this new discovery shows that people were experimenting with new communication technologies much earlier and in a different location than we had imagined before now."</p>

<p>Schwartz will share details of his discovery on Thursday, Nov. 21, at the <a href="https://www.asor.org/am/">American Society of Overseas Research's Annual Meeting</a>.</p>

<p>A Near Eastern archaeologist, Schwartz studies how early urban areas developed throughout Syria and how smaller cities emerged in the region. With colleagues from the University of Amsterdam, he co-directed a 16-year-long archaeological dig at Tell Umm-el Marra, one of the first medium-size urban centers that popped up in western Syria.</p>

<p>At Umm-el Marra, the archaeologists uncovered tombs dating back to the Early Bronze Age. One of the best-preserved tombs contained six skeletons, gold and silver jewelry, cookware, a spearhead, and intact pottery vessels. Next to the pottery, the researchers found four lightly baked clay cylinders with what seems to be alphabetic writing on them.</p>

<p>"The cylinders were perforated, so I'm imagining a string tethering them to another object to act as a label. Maybe they detail the contents of a vessel, or maybe where the vessel came from, or who it belonged to," Schwartz said. "Without a means to translate the writing, we can only speculate."</p>

<p>Using carbon-14 dating techniques, researchers confirmed the ages of the tombs, the artifacts, and the writing.</p>

<p>"Previously, scholars thought the alphabet was invented in or around Egypt sometime after 1900 BCE," Schwartz said. "But our artifacts are older and from a different area on the map, suggesting the alphabet may have an entirely different origin story than we thought."</p>

<p>I was studying the silicon die of the Pentium processor and noticed some puzzling structures where
signal lines were connected to the silicon substrate for no apparent reason.
Two examples are in the photo below, where the metal wiring (orange) connects to small square regions of doped silicon (gray), isolated from the rest of the circuitry.
I did some investigation and learned that these structures are
"antenna diodes," special diodes that protect the circuitry from damage during manufacturing.
In this blog post, I discuss the construction of the Pentium and explain how these antenna diodes work.</p>

<p>Intel released the Pentium processor in 1993,
starting a long-running brand of high-performance processors: the Pentium Pro, Pentium II, and so on.
In this post, I'm studying the original Pentium, which has 3.1 million transistors.<span id="fnref:versions"><a href="#fn:versions">1</a></span>
The die photo below shows the Pentium's fingernail-sized silicon die under a microscope. 
The chip has three layers of metal wiring on top of the silicon so the underlying silicon is almost entirely obscured.</p>
<!--
The tiny white squares around the edges of the chip are bond pads. Bond wires attached to these pads provide the
connections between the chip and its grid of 273 external pins.

<p>Modern processors are built from CMOS circuitry, which uses two types of transistors: NMOS and PMOS.
The diagram below shows how an NMOS transistor is constructed.
A transistor can be considered a switch between the source and drain, controlled by the gate.
The source and drain regions (green) consist of silicon doped with impurities to change its semiconductor properties, forming N+ silicon.
The gate consists of a layer of polysilicon (red), separated from the silicon by an absurdly thin insulating oxide layer.
Since the oxide layer is just a few hundred atoms thick,<span id="fnref:gate"><a href="#fn:gate">2</a></span> it is very fragile and easily damaged by excess voltage.
(This is why CMOS chips are sensitive to static electricity.) 
As we will see, the oxide layer can also be damaged by voltage during manufacturing.</p>

<p>The Pentium processor is constructed from multiple layers.
Starting at the bottom, the Pentium has millions of transistors similar to the diagram above.
Polysilicon wiring on top of the silicon not only forms the transistor gates but also provides short-range wiring.
Above that, three layers of metal wiring connect the parts of the chip.
Roughly speaking, the bottom layer of metal connects to the silicon and polysilicon to construct logic gates from the transistors, while the upper layers of wiring
travel longer distances, with one layer for signals traveling horizontally and the other layer for signals traveling vertically.
Tiny tungsten plugs called vias provide connections between the different layers of wiring.
A key challenge of chip design is routing, directing signals through the multiple layers of wiring while packing the circuitry as densely as possible.</p>
<p>The photo below shows a small region of the Pentium die with the three metal layers visible.
The golden vertical lines are the top metal layer, formed from aluminum and copper.
Underneath, you can see the horizontal wiring of the middle metal layer.
The more complex wiring of the bottom metal layer can be seen, along with the silicon and polysilicon that form transistors.
The small black dots are the tungsten vias that connect metal layers, while the larger dark circles are contacts with the
underlying silicon or polysilicon.
Near the bottom of the photo, the vertical gray bands are polysilicon lines, forming transistor gates.
Although the chip appears flat, it has a three-dimensional structure with multiple layers of metal
separated by insulating layers of silicon dioxide. This three-dimensional structure will be important in the discussion below.
(The metal wiring is much denser over most of the chip; this region is one of the rare spots where all the layers are visible.)</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/pentium-antenna/metal-layers.jpg"><img alt="Closeup of the Pentium die showing the metal layers.

This photo shows a tiny part of the floating point unit. To show all the layers in focus, I combined multiple images with focus stacking.</p>
<p>The manufacturing process for an integrated circuit is extraordinarily complicated but
I'll skip over most of the details and focus on how each metal layer is constructed, layer by layer.
First, a uniform metal layer is constructed over the silicon wafer.
Next, the desired pattern is produced on the surface using a process called photolithography:
a light-sensitive chemical called "resist"
is applied to the wafer and exposed to light through a patterned mask. 
The light hardens the resist, creating a protective coating with the pattern of the desired wiring.
Finally, the unprotected metal is etched away, leaving the wiring.</p>
<p>In the early days of integrated circuits, the metal was removed with liquid acids, a process called wet etching.
Inconveniently, wet etching tended to eat away metal underneath the edges of the mask, which became a problem as integrated circuits
became denser and the wires needed to be thinner.
The solution was dry etch, using a plasma to remove the metal.
By applying a large voltage to plates above and below the chip, a gas such as HCl is ionized into a highly reactive plasma.
This plasma attacks the surface (unless it is protected by the resist), removing the unwanted metal.
The advantage of dry etching is that it can act vertically (anisotropically), providing more control over the line width.</p>
<p>Although plasma etching improved the etching process, it caused another problem: plasma-induced oxide damage, also
called the "antenna effect."<span id="fnref:antenna"><a href="#fn:antenna">3</a></span>
The problem is that long metal wires on the chip could pick up an electrical charge from the plasma, producing a large voltage.
As described earlier, the thin oxide layer under a transistor's gate is sensitive to voltage damage.
The voltage induced by the plasma can destroy the transistor by blowing a hole through the gate oxide or
it can degrade the transistor's performance by embedding charges inside the oxide layer.<span id="fnref:damage"><a href="#fn:damage">4</a></span></p>
<p>Several factors affect the risk of damage from the antenna effect.
First, only the transistor's gate is sensitive to the induced voltage, due to the oxide layer.
If the wire is also connected to a transistor's source or drain, the wire is "safe" since the source and drain provide
connections to the chip's substrate, allowing the charge to dissipate harmlessly.
Note that when the chip is completed, every transistor gate is connected to another transistor's source or drain (which provides
the signal to the gate), so there is no risk of damage. 
Thus, the problem can only occur during manufacturing, with a metal line that is connected to a gate on one end but isn't
connected on the other end.
Moreover, the highest layer of metal is "safe" since everything is connected at that point.
Another factor is that the induced voltage is proportional to the length of the metal wire, so short wires don't pose a risk.
Finally, only the metal layer currently being etched poses a risk; since the lower layers are
insulated by the thick oxide between layers, they won't pick up charge.</p>
<p>These factors motivate several ways to prevent antenna problems.<span id="fnref:papers"><a href="#fn:papers">5</a></span>
First, a long wire can be broken into shorter segments, connected by jumpers on a higher layer.
Second, moving long wires to the top metal layer eliminates problems.<span id="fnref:top-metal"><a href="#fn:top-metal">6</a></span>
Third, diodes can be added to drain the charge from the wire; these are called "antenna diodes".
When the chip is in use, the antenna diodes are reverse-biased so they have no electrical effect.
But during manufacturing, the antenna diodes let charge flow to the substrate before it
causes problems.</p>
<p>The third solution, the antenna diodes, explains the mysterious connections that I saw in the Pentium.
In the diagram below, these diodes are visible on the die as square regions of doped silicon.
The larger regions of doped silicon form PMOS transistors (upper) and NMOS transistors (lower). 
The polysilicon lines are faintly visible; they form transistor gates where they cross the doped silicon.
(For this photo, I removed all the metal wiring.)</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/pentium-antenna/silicon-diagram.jpg"><img alt="Closeup of the Pentium die showing transistors. The metal and polysilicon layers have been removed to show the silicon." height="574" src="https://static.righto.com/images/pentium-antenna/silicon-diagram-w450.jpg" title="Closeup of the Pentium die showing transistors. The metal and polysilicon layers have been removed to show the silicon." width="450"></a></p><p>Closeup of the Pentium die showing transistors. The metal and polysilicon layers have been removed to show the silicon.</p>
<p>Confusingly, the antenna diodes look almost identical to "well taps", connections from the substrate to the chip's positive voltage supply,
but have a completely different purpose.
In the Pentium, the PMOS transistors are 
constructed in "wells" of N-type silicon.
These wells must be raised to the chip's positive voltage, so there are numerous well tap connections
from the positive supply to
the wells.
The well taps consist of squares of N+ doped silicon in the the N-type silicon well, providing an electrical connection.
On the other hand, the antenna diodes also consist of N+ doped silicon, but embedded in P-type silicon.
This forms a P-N junction that creates the diode.</p>
<p>In the Pentium, antenna diodes are used for only a small fraction of the wiring. The diodes require extra area on the
die, so they are used only when necessary. Most of the antenna problems on the Pentium were apparently resolved through
routing.
Although the antenna diodes are relatively rare, they are still frequent enough that they caught my attention.</p>
<p>Antenna effects are still an issue in modern integrated circuits.
Integrated circuit fabricators provide rules on the maximum allowable size of antenna wires for a particular manufacturing process.<span id="fnref:rules"><a href="#fn:rules">7</a></span>
Software checks the design to ensure that the antenna rules are not violated, modifying the routing and inserting diodes as
necessary.
Violating the antenna rules can result in damaged chips and a very low yield, so it's more than just a theoretical issue.</p>

I believe most people do not share their rationale enough.</p><p>Don’t just make a high-level, hand-waving statement. </p><p><span>Instead, share examples of what worked well in the past because it helps your feedback land. </span><a href="https://newsletter.weskao.com/p/rigorous-thinking" rel="">Supporting your claims</a><span> makes you more persuasive and objective--and increases the chances your senior leader will </span><a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/how-to-get-an-enthusiastic-yes" rel="">take your recommendation</a><span>.</span></p><p><strong>Example 1: Guidance during projects</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><blockquote><p><strong>🚫</strong><span> “We need to give more feedback during projects.”</span></p><p><strong>✅ </strong><span>“I noticed when we reviewed the design mockups weekly with the client, they loved the final result. For this project, early check-ins could help us make sure we’re aligned before going too far down a certain direction and could prevent rework.”</span></p></blockquote><p><strong>Example 2: Setting priorities</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><blockquote><p><strong>🚫</strong><span> “The team needs clearer priorities.”</span></p><p><strong>✅</strong><span> “The team made amazing progress when we all focused on the website update last month. It might help to have one or two clear priorities for the team this month that everyone can rally behind.”</span></p></blockquote><p><strong>Example 3: Training new hires</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><blockquote><p><strong>🚫 </strong><span>“We should spend more time training new people.”</span></p><p><strong>✅ </strong><span>“When we were able to dedicate that first week to training Steve, he got up to speed pretty quickly.

I’m thrilled to see the testimonials from alumni continue to roll in too. Here’s what students are saying:</p><blockquote><p>“I decided to join Wes’ course because I've been a huge fan of her newsletter for a long time. It's always easy to get stuck in your own head or to be verbose in your writing when people are constantly asking for something from you and there's no time to think about your audience. I found the frameworks and perspective Wes shared really valuable, especially in a world where concise and clear written communication is critical. I would recommend this class for anyone who needs to align a large group of stakeholders or bring a valuable recommendation to executives.” </p></blockquote><p><span>- Angela Santurbano, </span><strong>Principal Product Manager, Square</strong></p><blockquote><p>“Highly, highly recommended. This is the rare communication course I’ve taken that focuses on how I actually get things done at work: Slacks, emails, last minute cross-functional meetings, and constantly managing up. It’s also the rare virtual course where the activities are challenging, actually mirror real life scenarios, and provide a valuable opportunity to practice skills. On top of all that, Wes is giving real-time constructive feedback to her students. Sign up!” </p></blockquote><p><span>- Fred Geyer, </span><strong>Manager, Employee Onboarding Experience, HelloFresh</strong></p><blockquote><p>“This course was filled with clear, actionable insights to improve communication habits and practices in my everyday work. I'm excited to implement the strategies Wes covered.” </p></blockquote><p><span>- Jess Mordo, Senior Manager, </span><strong>Senior Manager (Acquisition Marketing),</strong><span> </span><strong>Grammarly</strong></p><blockquote><p>“This course provides a practical set of tools and tactics to apply immediately to your writing. It sparked valuable discussions within my team, who also attended, and I highly recommend it to anyone frequently operating in a ‘debate and commit’ environment. Wes’s approach to clear, kind, and persuasive writing is especially relevant if you rely on channels like Slack or Teams.”</p></blockquote><p><span>- Morgan King, </span><strong>Director of Client Support, Stitch Fix</strong></p><blockquote><p>“This was an excellent course. I appreciated the real-world examples, appropriate level and complexity of coursework, and the ask-me-anything Q&amp;A sessions. Very well done!” </p></blockquote><p><span>- Eric Livingston, </span><strong>Senior Director of Product Management, Salesforce</strong></p><p><span>In the past week, operators from Adobe, Meta, Shopify, Autodesk, Grammarly, Klayvio, Chick-fil-A, eBay, Square, Equifax, Roblox, etc have signed up.

<h2>Reverse engineers bust sleazy gig work platform (<a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/11/23/hack-the-class-war/#robo-boss">permalink</a>)</h2>
<blockquote><p>
  A COMPUTER CAN NEVER BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE</p>
<p>  THEREFORE A COMPUTER MUST NEVER MAKE A MANAGEMENT DECISION
</p></blockquote>
<p>Supposedly, these lines were included in a 1979 internal presentation at IBM; screenshots of them routinely go viral:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/SwiftOnSecurity/status/1385565737167724545?lang=en">https://twitter.com/SwiftOnSecurity/status/1385565737167724545?lang=en</a></p>
<p>The reason for their newfound popularity is obvious: the rise and rise of algorithmic management tools, in which your boss is an app. That IBM slide is right: turning an app into your boss allows your <em>actual</em> boss to create an "accountability sink" in which there is no obvious way to blame a human or even a company for your maltreatment:</p>
<p><a href="https://profilebooks.com/work/the-unaccountability-machine/">https://profilebooks.com/work/the-unaccountability-machine/</a></p>
<p>App-based management-by-bossware treats the bug identified by the unknown author of that IBM slide into a feature. When an app is your boss, it can force you to scab:</p>

<p>Or it can steal your wages:</p>

<p>But tech giveth and tech taketh away. Digital technology is infinitely flexible: the program that spies on you can be defeated by another program that defeats spying. Every time your algorithmic boss hacks you, you can hack your boss back:</p>

<p>Technologists and labor organizers need one another. Even the most precarious and abused workers can team up with hackers to disenshittify their robo-bosses:</p>

<p>For every abuse technology brings to the workplace, there is a liberating use of technology that workers unleash by seizing the means of computation:</p>

<p>One tech-savvy group on the cutting edge of dismantling the Torment Nexus is Algorithms Exposed, a tiny, scrappy group of EU hacker/academics who recruit volunteers to reverse engineer and modify the algorithms that rule our lives as workers and as customers:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/10/e2e/#the-censors-pen">https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/10/e2e/#the-censors-pen</a></p>
<p>Algorithms Exposed have an admirable supply of seemingly boundless energy. Every time I check in with them, I learn that they've spun out yet another special-purpose subgroup. Today, I learned about Reversing Works, a hacking team that reverse engineers gig work apps, revealing corporate wrongdoing that leads to multimillion euro fines for especially sleazy companies.</p>
<p>One such company is Foodinho, an Italian subsidiary of the Spanish food delivery company Glovo. Foodinho/Glovo has been in the crosshairs of Italian labor enforcers since before the pandemic, racking up millions in fines – first for failing to file the proper privacy paperwork disclosing the nature of the data processing in the app that Foodinho riders use to book jobs. Then, after the Italian data commission investigated Foodinho, the company attracted new, much larger fines for its out-of-control surveillance conduct.</p>
<p>As all of this was underway, Reversing Works was conducting its own research into Glovo/Foodinho's app, running it on a simulated Android handset inside a PC so they could peer into app's data collection and processing. They discovered a nightmarish world of pervasive, illegal worker surveillance, and published their findings a year ago in November, 2023:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.etui.org/sites/default/files/2023-10/Exercising%20workers%20rights%20in%20algorithmic%20management%20systems_Lessons%20learned%20from%20the%20Glovo-Foodinho%20digital%20labour%20platform%20case_2023.pdf">https://www.etui.org/sites/default/files/2023-10/Exercising%20workers%20rights%20in%20algorithmic%20management%20systems_Lessons%20learned%20from%20the%20Glovo-Foodinho%20digital%20labour%20platform%20case_2023.pdf</a></p>
<p>That report reveals all kinds of extremely illegal behavior. Glovo/Foodinho makes its riders' data accessible across national borders, so Glovo managers outside of Italy can access fine-grained surveillance information and sensitive personal information – a major data protection no-no.</p>
<p>Worse, Glovo's app embeds trackers from a huge number of other tech platforms (for chat, analytics, and more), making it impossible for the company to account for all the ways that its riders' data is collected – again, a requirement under Italian and EU data protection law.</p>
<p>All this data collection continues even when riders have clocked out for the day – it's as though your boss followed you home after quitting time and spied on you.</p>
<p>The research also revealed evidence of a secretive worker scoring system that ranked workers based on undisclosed criteria and reserved the best jobs for workers with high scores. This kind of thing is pervasive in algorithmic management, from gig work to Youtube and Tiktok, where performers' videos are routinely suppressed because they crossed some undisclosed line. When an app is your boss, your every paycheck is docked because you violated a policy you're not allowed to know about, because if you knew why your boss was giving you shitty jobs, or refusing to show the video you spent thousands of dollars making to the subscribers who asked to see it, then maybe you could figure out how to keep your boss from detecting your rulebreaking next time.</p>
<p>All this data-collection and processing is bad enough, but what makes it all a thousand times worse is Glovo's data <em>retention</em> policy – they're storing this data on their workers for <em>four years</em> after the worker leaves their employ. That means that mountains of sensitive, potentially ruinous data on gig workers is just lying around, waiting to be stolen by the next hacker that breaks into the company's servers.</p>
<p>Reversing Works's report made quite a splash. A year after its publication, the Italian data protection agency fined Glovo <em>another</em> 5 million euros and ordered them to <em>cut this shit out</em>:</p>
<p><a href="https://reversing.works/posts/2024/11/press-release-reversing.works-investigation-exposes-glovos-data-privacy-violations-marking-a-milestone-for-worker-rights-and-technology-accountability/">https://reversing.works/posts/2024/11/press-release-reversing.works-investigation-exposes-glovos-data-privacy-violations-marking-a-milestone-for-worker-rights-and-technology-accountability/</a></p>
<p>As the report points out, Italy is extremely well set up to defend workers' rights from this kind of bossware abuse. Not only do Italian enforcers have all the privacy tools created by the GDPR, the EU's flagship privacy regulation – they also have the benefit of Italy's 1970 Workers' Statute. The Workers Statute is a visionary piece of legislation that protects workers from automated management practices. Combined with later privacy regulation, it gave Italy's data regulators sweeping powers to defend Italian workers, like Glovo's riders.</p>
<p>Italy is also a leader in recognizing gig workers as de facto employees, despite the tissue-thin pretense that adding an app to your employment means that you aren't entitled to any labor protections. In the case of Glovo, the fine-grained surveillance and reputation scoring were deemed proof that Glovo <em>was</em> employer to its riders.</p>
<p>Reversing Works' report is a fascinating read, especially the sections detailing how the researchers recruited a Glovo rider who allowed them to log in to Glovo's platform on their account.</p>
<p>As Reversing Works points out, this bottom-up approach – where apps are subjected to technical analysis – has real potential for labor organizations seeking to protect workers. Their report established multiple grounds on which a union could seek to hold an abusive employer to account.</p>
<p>But this bottom-up approach also holds out the potential for developing direct-action tools that let workers flex their power, by modifying apps, or coordinating their actions to wring concessions out of their bosses.</p>
<p>After all, the whole reason for the gig economy is to slash wage-bills, by transforming workers into contractors, and by eliminating managers in favor of algorithms. This leaves companies extremely vulnerable, because when workers come together to exercise power, their employer can't rely on middle managers to pressure workers, deal with irate customers, or step in to fill the gap themselves:</p>

<p>Only by seizing the means of computation, workers and organized labor can turn the tables on bossware – both by directly altering the conditions of their employment, and by producing the evidence and tools that regulators can use to force employers to make those alterations permanent.</p>
