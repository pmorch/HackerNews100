<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>TL;DR:</p><p><em>We've been on the Cloudflare Business plan ($250/month) for years. They suddenly contacted us and asked us to either pay them $120k up front for one year of Enterprise within 24 hours or they would take down all of our domains. While this escalated up our business we had 3 sales calls with them, trying to figure out what was happening and how to reach a reasonable contract in a week. When we told them we were also in talks with Fastly, they suddenly "purged" all our domains, causing huge downtime in our core business, sleepless nights migrating away from CF, irreparable loss in customer trust and weeks of ongoing downtime in our internal systems.</em></p><p>I'm a SysOps engineer at a fairly large online casino. We have around 4 million monthly active users. We had been happy Cloudflare customers since 2018 on the "Business" plan which has some neat features and costs $250/month for "unlimited" traffic.</p><p>Now admittedly, $250 is probably fairly low for the amount of traffic we were pushing through Cloudflare. We mainly use CF for the CDN (caching all our static content) and DDOS protection, for which it works pretty well. It’s easy to use and you don’t usually have to think about it much.</p><p>I had read a few articles on Hacker News about how at some point Cloudflare contacts you, asking you aggressively to move to "Enterprise" with custom pricing. But I wasn't expecting it to go this horribly.</p><p>In April, we received this email from Cloudflare:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74bcf245-b6da-4e0d-93b5-eedf42e7ff51_897x407.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74bcf245-b6da-4e0d-93b5-eedf42e7ff51_897x407.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74bcf245-b6da-4e0d-93b5-eedf42e7ff51_897x407.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74bcf245-b6da-4e0d-93b5-eedf42e7ff51_897x407.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74bcf245-b6da-4e0d-93b5-eedf42e7ff51_897x407.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74bcf245-b6da-4e0d-93b5-eedf42e7ff51_897x407.png" width="897" height="407" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/74bcf245-b6da-4e0d-93b5-eedf42e7ff51_897x407.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:407,&quot;width&quot;:897,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74bcf245-b6da-4e0d-93b5-eedf42e7ff51_897x407.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74bcf245-b6da-4e0d-93b5-eedf42e7ff51_897x407.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74bcf245-b6da-4e0d-93b5-eedf42e7ff51_897x407.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74bcf245-b6da-4e0d-93b5-eedf42e7ff51_897x407.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>This sounds like there's some issue with our website.

We do have multiple domains that </span><em>mostly</em><span> act as mirrors to our main domain. We have these for a few reasons. One is that since we are a casino, we have different regulatory requirements we need to comply with in many countries. For example, many games are only available in some countries. Some countries we block completely. Then we have a few different domains that remove certain game groups or site features - for example our social features (chat, user tipping / interaction) or our sportsbook. Another is that we use them to target different global user groups and affiliates and track conversions long-term. This also means that if a country DNS-blocks our main domain, a secondary domain may still be available. This could arguably be seen as a violation of the Cloudflare TOS, as they wrote above.</span></p><p><span>In any case, </span><strong>we receive &gt;95% of our traffic through the main domain</strong><span> that’s been unchanged since our founding, and were happy to resolve this issue in whatever way, including by removing any affected secondary domains from Cloudflare.</span></p><p>We sent them info about our domains and tried to get more information from them about the issue and who from our team we should get involved, but they refused to give us anything apart from a date for a call.</p><p><span>So we scheduled another call, now with their "Trust and Safety" team. But it turns out, </span><strong>we were actually talking to Sales again</strong><span>.</span></p><p>They said they could offer us an amazing contract for $10k per month with all kinds of great features. We tried figuring out how exactly this was related to the TOS problem and how to resolve the situation. We asked them which domains were affected by their “rotation” concerns. They didn't give us an answer. We asked which of the Enterprise features we actually had to get.</p><p><span>They would not offer us anything apart from a full deal </span><strong>for $10k per month</strong><span>, which would magically resolve the issue. They were not interested in any other resolution.</span></p><p><span>They said we had 24h to sign their contract because they had to “get back to Trust &amp; Safety". We asked to pay monthly. They said we </span><em>need</em><span> to sign a yearly commitment and pay the full year up front. It felt like extortion. Pay us $120k until tomorrow or we destroy your business.</span></p><p>After the call, they sent us this:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a0103e0-2c3d-4ba2-94f8-554297592188_1280x856.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a0103e0-2c3d-4ba2-94f8-554297592188_1280x856.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a0103e0-2c3d-4ba2-94f8-554297592188_1280x856.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a0103e0-2c3d-4ba2-94f8-554297592188_1280x856.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a0103e0-2c3d-4ba2-94f8-554297592188_1280x856.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a0103e0-2c3d-4ba2-94f8-554297592188_1280x856.jpeg" width="1280" height="856" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0a0103e0-2c3d-4ba2-94f8-554297592188_1280x856.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:856,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:153184,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a0103e0-2c3d-4ba2-94f8-554297592188_1280x856.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a0103e0-2c3d-4ba2-94f8-554297592188_1280x856.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a0103e0-2c3d-4ba2-94f8-554297592188_1280x856.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0a0103e0-2c3d-4ba2-94f8-554297592188_1280x856.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Note the email implies a monthly payment might be possible.

Luckily we only had our NS pointed to CF and thus could move away with ~3-24h of downtime for most users.</span></p></li><li><p>Don't use any custom caching rules on CF. CF by default ignores most / all standard HTTP cache headers except for an arbitrary set of extensions and encourages you to create custom rules on CF. Instead, set CF to "Cache: Always" (this does not actually mean always) and "Respect Origin Headers". That way the rules will work for other caching proxies.</p></li><li><p>Don't use any proprietary Cloudflare products like Zero Access or Workers. We heavily used Zero Access for authentication in internal products, and now we have to rebuild all this infrastructure from scratch with massive downtimes. Only use their technology where it is compatible with third-party standards.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Make backups of your configuration on Cloudflare. It's an unexpectedly large pain to recreate all those configurations, including various sending email services (SPF, DKIM, …), site verification DNS entries, ip lists, rate limiting rules, etc.</p></li><li><p>Make sure you understand the impact of CF’s business model on you: Either you’re leeching off Cloudflare (customers on the free/business plan), or Cloudflare is leeching off you (intransparent Enterprise pricing). There is no in-between, and at some point the time comes to switch.</p></li><li><p>And: Consider whether you need Cloudflare at all.</p><ul><li><p>CF only managed (for us) pretty large DDOS attacks. If you have some a bit more vulnerable attack surfaces (for example, an uncached unauthenticated API request that eats up 100ms of CPU time, and can thus use up your cores with just 10-100 requests per second), Cloudflare is not even going to detect it. Especially since all semi-professional “DDOS attack as a service” groups seem specifically specialized for Cloudflare-backed services, including “Under Attack Mode” workarounds etc.</p></li></ul></li></ul></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="text-block"><p><b>Sara needed some chocolate - she had had one of those days - so wandered into a Home Bargains store.</b></p><p>"Within less than a minute, I'm approached by a store worker who comes up to me and says, 'You're a thief, you need to leave the store'."</p><p>Sara - who wants to remain anonymous - was wrongly accused after being flagged by a facial-recognition system called Facewatch. </p><p>She says after her bag was searched she was led out of the shop, and told she was banned from all stores using the technology. </p><p>"I was just crying and crying the entire journey home… I thought, 'Oh, will my life be the same? I'm going to be looked at as a shoplifter when I've never stolen'."</p><p>Facewatch later wrote to Sara and acknowledged it had made an error. </p><p>Facewatch is used in numerous stores in the UK - including Budgens, Sports Direct and Costcutter - to identify shoplifters.</p><p>The company declined to comment on Sara's case to the BBC, but did say its technology helped to prevent crime and protect frontline workers. Home Bargains, too, declined to comment.</p><p>It's not just retailers who are turning to the technology. </p><p>On a humid day in Bethnal Green, in east London, we joined the police as they positioned a modified white van on the high street. </p><p>Cameras attached to its roof captured thousands of images of people's faces. </p><p>If they matched people on a police watchlist, officers would speak to them and potentially arrest them. </p><p>Unflattering references to the technology liken the process to a supermarket checkout - where your face becomes a bar code. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>On the day we were filming, the Metropolitan Police said they made six arrests with the assistance of the tech. </p><p>That included two people who breached the terms of their sexual-harm prevention orders, a man wanted for grievous bodily harm and a person wanted for the assault of a police officer. </p><p>Lindsey Chiswick, director of intelligence for the Met, told the BBC the tech's speed was extremely helpful.</p><p>"It takes less than a second for the technology to create a biometric image of a person's face, assess it against the bespoke watchlist and automatically delete it when there is no match."</p><p>The BBC spoke to several people approached by the police who confirmed that they had been correctly identified by the system - 192 arrests have been made so far this year as a result of it.</p><p>But civil liberty groups are worried that its accuracy is yet to be fully established, and point to cases such as Shaun Thompson's.</p><p>Mr Thompson, who works for youth-advocacy group Streetfathers, didn't think much of it when he walked by a white van near London Bridge in February. </p><p>Within a few seconds, though, he was approached by police and told he was a wanted man. </p><p>"That's when I got a nudge on the shoulder, saying at that time I'm wanted".</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>He was asked to give fingerprints and held for 20 minutes. He says he was let go only after handing over a copy of his passport. </p><p>But it was a case of mistaken identity. </p><p>"It felt intrusive… I was treated guilty until proven innocent," he says. </p><p>The BBC understands the mistake might have been due to a family resemblance. The Metropolitan Police declined to comment.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Silkie Carlo, director of Big Brother Watch, has filmed the police on numerous facial-recognition deployments. She was there the night Shaun Thompson was picked up by police. </p><p>"My experience, observing live facial recognition for many years, [is that] most members of the public don't really know what live facial recognition is," she says.</p><p>She says that anyone's face who is scanned is effectively part of a digital police line-up. </p><p>"If they trigger a match alert, then the police will come in, possibly detain them and question them and ask them to prove their innocence."</p><p>The use of facial recognition by the police is ramping up.</p><p>Between 2020 and 2022 the Metropolitan Police used live facial recognition nine times. The following year the figure was 23.</p><p>Already in 2024 it has been used 67 times, so the direction of travel is clear. </p><p>Champions say that misidentifications are rare. </p><p>The Metropolitan Police say that around one in every 33,000 people who walk by its cameras is misidentified. </p><p>But the error count is much higher once an someone is actually flagged. One in 40 alerts so far this year has been a false positive. </p><p>Michael Birtwhistle, head of research at the Ada Lovelace Institute research group, believes the technology is so new that the laws have not yet caught up. </p><p>"I think it absolutely is a Wild West at the moment. That's what creates this legal uncertainty as to whether current uses are unlawful or not," he says. </p><p>In Bethnal Green, although some people the BBC spoke to were worried about the use of the tech, a majority were supportive - if it helped to tackle crime. </p><p>That leads to another question about the technology: will it help in the long run? </p><p>As people get more used to seeing white vans parked on busy high streets, will people who know they are wanted by police simply get wise to the cameras and avoid them? Will shoplifters hide their faces? </p><p>Ms Carlo says society needs to guard against facial recognition becoming normalised.</p><p>"Once the police can say this is OK, this is something that we can do routinely, why not put it into the fixed-camera networks?"</p><p>This is the dystopian future that civil-liberty campaigners are most afraid of - a China-style mass-surveillance state. </p><p>Advocates dismiss such dire predictions as overblown.</p><p>And it is also clear there are plenty among the public who are willing to put up with having their faces scanned - if it means safer streets. </p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Hurl is a language created for one purpose: to explore a language based around exception handling as the only control flow.
It was sparked from conversations between <a href="https://ntietz.com/">Nicole Tietz-Sokolskaya</a> and friends from <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a> whose identities will be withheld for their dignity.</p>
<p>This site contains documentation around how to use Hurl.
It also provides some examples and guidance for debugging and answers questions.</p>
<h2 id="praise-for-hurl"><a href="#praise-for-hurl">Praise for Hurl</a></h2>
<p>It comes highly endorsed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I, uh, have changed my mind about ever implementing a language based on Hurl.

<p>In 2022, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War">Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine</a>, waging a genocidal war against my country. Ukraine is being hit by all types of weapons (except nuclear) daily. Home Assistant helps me stay safe and notifies me about incoming threats.</p>
<p>We hear the siren a few times a day. Life would completely stop if we went to the shelter every time the siren goes off. So, people adapt.</p>
<p>In Ukraine, we tend to differentiate the levels of danger. When the siren goes off, practically everyone starts checking their phones: "What is going on?"</p>
<p>We have <a href="https://alerts.in.ua/">various applications</a> and <a href="https://t.me/s/war_monitor">Telegram channels</a> for monitoring the type of danger, missile paths, and understanding whether we are in direct danger or can continue with our lives for another minute.</p>
<p>This is what war in the 21st century looks like: you can practically monitor a missile or a drone that is trying to kill you right from your phone. This is like a Black Mirror episode in real life. 😅</p>
<p>There are different kinds of air alarms with varying levels of danger:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MiG-31K take off</strong> – This can happen multiple times during the day. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikoyan_MiG-31">MiG-31K</a> can carry a very dangerous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kh-47M2_Kinzhal">Kh-47M2 Kinzhal hypersonic missile</a>. Although it happens rarely, you can't predict when the missile is attached and when it is not, so most people tolerate this level of danger.</li>
<li><strong>Suicide drones attack</strong> – Usually carried out by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HESA_Shahed_136">Iranian Shahed 136 drones</a>. Most of them get shot down, but they are still dangerous and scary. We call them "mopeds" or "lawn-mowers" because of the sound of their engine.</li>
<li><strong>Ballistic missile attack</strong> – This can happen multiple times a day. Ballistic missiles, like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9K720_Iskander">9K720 Iskander</a>, are extremely fast (2 km/s). You have only up to 10 minutes to hide somewhere. Usually, the fastest way is to hide behind two walls (corridor or a bathroom).</li>
<li><strong>Cruise missile attack</strong> – Cruise missiles, like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalibr_(missile_family)">Kalibr</a>, are relatively slow and fly like a plane. Nevertheless, they can fly a long distance and easily reach any point in the country.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, the most dangerous type of attack is a combined one. This means all of the above are raining down on Ukrainian cities simultaneously. These usually happen overnight at 4:00 in the morning. The drones and cruise missiles are used to exhaust air defenses, followed by ballistic and/or hypersonic strikes.</p>
<h2 id="monitoring-air-alerts">Monitoring Air Alerts<a href="#monitoring-air-alerts" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Home Assistant has a built-in <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/ukraine_alarm/">Ukraine Alarm</a> integration. It monitors the nation-wide system of air alarms and toggles safety sensors in HA.</p>
<p>When there is any type of danger, I send a critical notification and announce the message on my smart speakers.</p>
<p>Of course, the air siren goes off on the streets, roaring across the city, so everyone hears the danger is approaching. But I made an automation to send a critical notification and speak at home speakers, so I certainly wake up to check what is going on.</p>

<h2 id="scraping-monitoring-channels">Scraping Monitoring Channels<a href="#scraping-monitoring-channels" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>I already mentioned we have various Telegram channels for monitoring the situation during an attack. Those channels provide live updates on dangers, flight paths, and the type of attack.</p>
<p>So often I found myself constantly checking my phone to understand whether I am in direct danger or can sleep for a few hours. <em>I know it sounds crazy, and normal people would go straight to the nearby shelter, but this is life in Ukraine. You don't have to follow my reckless example. If you are in Ukraine, GO TO THE SHELTER!</em></p>
<p>I decided to automate it. Instead of reading these channels myself, I delegate this task to HA.</p>
<p>I use the <a href="https://github.com/danieldotnl/ha-multiscrape">HA Multiscrape</a> custom integration for that. You may ask, "why do you need a custom component when <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/scrape/">HA has a built-in scraping component</a>?" Yes, it does, but I need multiple sensors from a single scrape, and I need to work with lists of data. The built-in component has some limitations with that.</p>
<h2 id="monitoring-imminent-danger">Monitoring Imminent Danger<a href="#monitoring-imminent-danger" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Cruise missiles are usually carried and launched by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupolev_Tu-95">Tu-95 bombers</a>.</p>
<p>They fly to the missile launch sites for about 3 hours, launch their missiles, then it takes about 1-2 hours for missiles to fly to Kyiv. So there's some time to prepare a hideout (in my case, it's the bathroom), gather documents, and sleep for a few hours before the "show" begins.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="Tu-95 takes off notification" src="https://github.com/denysdovhan/home-assistant-config/assets/3459374/eb24f547-8ef6-47b4-a60c-97995dfaf02c">
<figcaption>Notification about Tu-95 bombers taking off</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Usually, it happens in the evening and means tonight will be a massive missile attack.</p>
<p>I have a sensor that checks the Telegram channels, scrapes the list of messages every 5 seconds, and checks if the latest message contains a specific set of words, like <em>"take off" <strong>and</strong> "plane" <strong>and</strong> "tu-95"</em>. It also stores the latest message as an attribute.</p>

<h2 id="direct-danger-alert">Direct Danger Alert<a href="#direct-danger-alert" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>This is the most interesting sensor, which notifies me right when there's a direct threat to my location.</p>

<img alt="Direct danger notification" src="https://github.com/denysdovhan/home-assistant-config/assets/3459374/05f1821c-89f5-474e-bf95-fffb3ea459d8">
<figcaption>Notification about direct danger</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When an attack happens at night, you need to decide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you going to the shelter to get a sleepless night somewhere in a basement or in the subway?</li>
<li>Or are you going to stay in bed as long as possible to get some sleep, because you need to go to work tomorrow?</li>
</ul>
<p>Every normal person would go to the shelter. But when you live in these conditions for some time, you try to calculate the risk:</p>
<ul>
<li>You need to get proper sleep to be able to work.</li>
<li>The air defenses are titans; they do their job excellently. Flying threats are getting shot down regularly.</li>
<li>In Kyiv, the risk of a direct hit or hit by debris is relatively tolerable: I guess like being hit by a car (this estimate is completely unscientific!).</li>
<li>If you are unlucky to catch a direct hit – you are dead anyway. There's very little chance to survive that.</li>
<li>If the missile/drone gets shot down nearby, the shockwave will blow your windows.</li>
</ul>
<p>So what do you do? It's up to you, but most of the time, I decide to sleep in bed. When things get hot, I hide in a bathroom so that when something blows up nearby, <a href="https://visitukraine.today/blog/990/list-of-things-to-put-in-an-emergency-suitcase-and-basic-rules-that-will-save-lives-during-missile-strikes">I will be behind two walls</a> from glass shards and shockwaves.</p>
<p>I have a sensor that watches for specific keywords like <em>"Kyiv"</em> or a neighborhood name, for <em>"warning" <strong>or</strong> "be in a safe place" <strong>or</strong> "fast target"</em>.</p>

<p><a href="https://aerominetechnologies.com/">Aeromine Technologies</a> just closed a $9 million funding round, and it’s ready to scale up production of its bladeless rooftop wind turbines. </p>



<p>Energy research, investing, and strategy firm Veriten is the lead investor in Aeromine Technologies’ Series A funding round. </p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="1920" height="1439" src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/Aeromine_2.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024" alt="" srcset="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/Aeromine_2.jpg 1920w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/Aeromine_2.jpg?resize=150,112 150w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/Aeromine_2.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/Aeromine_2.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/Aeromine_2.jpg?resize=1024,767 1024w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/Aeromine_2.jpg?resize=1536,1151 1536w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/Aeromine_2.jpg?resize=350,262 350w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/Aeromine_2.jpg?resize=140,105 140w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/Aeromine_2.jpg?resize=1334,1000 1334w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"></figure>



<p>Aeromine, launched in 2022, makes compact 50 kW or larger “wind harvesting platforms” that it mounts on the edge of a building’s roof. The rooftop wind units, which have no external moving parts or blades, capture wind flowing up and over the building and convert it into onsite electricity. Its generator system is a rotor-stator system with a highly efficient 5 kW permanent magnet generator. (<a href="https://26011849.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/26011849/Aeromine%20Website/downloads/Aeromine%20cut%20sheet%20231004.pdf">Specs are here</a>.) </p>



<p>The noiseless technology leverages aerodynamics like airfoils on a race car to capture and amplify each building’s airflow to generate energy. Aeromine says its systems typically consist of 20-40 units installed on the edge of a building facing the predominant wind direction.</p>



<p>Each 1,000-pound unit can withstand winds of between 120 and 158 mph depending on specification.</p>



<p>Aeromine’s units can operate independently or be integrated with existing rooftop solar arrays. Onsite power generation eliminates grid supply disruptions.</p>



<p>Maynard Holt, founder &amp; CEO of Veriten, said: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>We believe that distributed power innovation will play a vital role in helping companies fulfill their need for reliable, reasonably priced electricity and desire for low-impact power. We’re excited to partner with Aeromine, as its ability to quickly and affordably help a wide variety of companies meet their energy needs with wind resources is unique among distributed energy solutions.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The bladeless wind turbines are designed to power apartment buildings, warehouses, manufacturing facilities, offices, hospitals, retail centers – basically any big box building with a flat, unobstructed roof. </p>




	<p>The company says it has 400 qualified projects in its pipeline and expects to roll out commercially in Europe and North America in 2025.&nbsp;</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p><a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki">tmux</a>
(short for “terminal mux” (short for “multiplexer”))
is
<a href="https://i3wm.org/">i3</a>
for your terminal.
Oh, it’s so much more than that, and I recently discovered with
some joy that it is installed by default on
<a href="https://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a>,
but its fundamental value add to any programmer who has to
SSH into servers more than once a week is it allows you to
split your screen up into multiple independent shells
<em>without needing a graphical environment at all</em>.
If you want to walk the path of true digital minimalism,
<a href="https://www.vim.org/">vanilla Vim</a>
and tmux or its spiritual grandfather
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/">screen</a>
are all you need.</p><p>So it’s always been interesting to me that a developer as
seasoned as
<a href="https://kovidgoyal.net/">Kovid Goyal</a>,
developer of the ePub powerhouse calibre and
my current teminal emulator of choice
<a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/">Kitty</a>,
has gone on record a number of times saying he is not a fan
of tmux. He has
<a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/faq/#i-am-using-tmux-and-have-a-problem">a whole section in his FAQ about it</a>:</p><blockquote><p>[T]erminal multiplexers are <a href="https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/391#issuecomment-638320745">a bad idea</a>, do not use them, if at all possible. kitty contains features that do all of what tmux does, but better, with the exception of remote persistence.</p></blockquote><p>(I don’t use remote persistence. I’m aware I’m a
caveman.)</p><p>And from the linked Git comment:</p><blockquote><p>[Terminal m]ultiplexers add unnecessary overhead, suffer from a complexity cascade, because they actually have to <em>translate</em> escape codes, modifying them in hackish ways to get them to work with their concepts of windows/sessions. […] Energy/performance wise they are poison, every byte has to be parsed twice, once by the middleman and once by the terminal. And they act as a drag on the ecosystem as a whole, making it very hard to get any new features. […] Terminals [themselves] are fine, certainly better than any other interface paradigm I have ever seen.</p></blockquote><p>I’m not here to incur Goyal’s wrath. He knows way more
about this space than I do, and I’m clearly a very
satisfied user of kitty at home, where I have the
ability to tweak my environment to be exactly what
I want it to be.</p><p>Therein lies the rub. At home, I run UNIX on my metal.
At work, I use Windows. And so, the multiple times a
day I find myself SSHing into one of our many, many
quasi-embedded Linux boxes, I find myself typing out
“tmux” as the first command I run. Because it’s always
going to be there, and it does the one thing I actually
need it to no matter what: Let me run multiple shells
at once, without SSHing in multiple times, regardless
of whatever funky terminal emulator I’m actually using
to get the job done. Alacritty, Windows Terminal,
whatever.</p><p>kitty has to run on what I’m remoting <em>from</em>.
tmux can work on what I’m remoting <em>into</em>.
And that makes
all the difference.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better#New_Jerseay_style">Worse is better</a>
is more of a product managment philosophy than a
software philosophy, IMO, but it basically underlines
the idea that whatever your software’s killer app is,
you want to get that <em>really</em> right for the most common
use cases, even if it means living with a suboptimal
approach.
<a href="https://hiandrewquinn.github.io/til-site/posts/the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-vms-in-hacker-pedagogy/">I love VMs for a lot of reasons</a>,
and I even maintain
<a href="https://github.com/hiAndrewQuinn/shell-bling-ubuntu">a set of 3 shell scripts</a>
which turns a vanilla Ubuntu VM into my personal software
development workhorse, complete with LazyVim, ripgrep,
tmux, and - yes - Kitty as the default terminal.
But even with that it’s
rare these days that I am doing such prolonged development
work that I feel it’s worth actually working in
such a VM. The perils of becoming a middle manager, alas.</p><p>So, for the most part, I remote in directly
from Windows. Which means I’m going to use tmux on
my servers. Which is why I have <code>C-b %</code> and <code>C-b "</code>
memorized and not … <em>checks kitty docs</em> … wait,
is it really <code>C-S-Enter</code>?</p><p>That’s so <em>nice</em>. Man. We are missing out.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Social media is abuzz with examples of Google’s new AI Overview product saying weird stuff, from telling users to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/23/24162896/google-ai-overview-hallucinations-glue-in-pizza">put glue on their pizza</a> to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/google/comments/1cziil6/a_rock_a_day_keeps_the_doctor_away/">suggesting they eat rocks</a>. The messy rollout means Google is racing to manually disable AI Overviews for specific searches as various memes get posted, which is why users are seeing <a href="https://www.threads.net/@reckless1280/post/C7VVgb9Ik--">so many of them disappear</a> shortly after being posted to social networks.</p><p>It’s an odd situation, since Google has been testing AI Overviews for a year now — the feature launched in beta <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/10/23717120/google-search-ai-results-generated-experience-io">in May 2023 as the Search Generative Experience</a> — and CEO Sundar Pichai has said the company served over a billion queries in that time.</p><p>But Pichai has also said that Google’s brought the cost of delivering AI answers down by 80 percent over that same time, “driven by hardware, engineering and technical breakthroughs.” It appears that kind of optimization might have happened too early, before the tech was ready.</p><p>“A company once known for being at the cutting edge and shipping high-quality stuff is now known for low-quality output that’s getting meme’d,” one AI founder, who wished to remain anonymous, told <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>Google continues to say that its AI Overview product largely outputs “high quality information” to users. “Many of the examples we’ve seen have been uncommon queries, and we’ve also seen examples that were doctored or that we couldn’t reproduce,” Google spokesperson Meghann Farnsworth said in an email to <em>The Verge</em>. Farnsworth also confirmed that the company is “taking swift action” to remove AI Overviews on certain queries “where appropriate under our content policies, and using these examples to develop broader improvements to our systems, some of which have already started to roll out.”</p><p>Gary Marcus, an AI expert and an emeritus professor of neural science at New York University, told <em>The Verge</em> that a lot of AI companies are “selling dreams” that this tech will go from 80 percent correct to 100 percent. Achieving the initial 80 percent is relatively straightforward since it involves approximating a large amount of human data, Marcus said, but the final 20 percent is extremely challenging. In fact, Marcus thinks that last 20 percent might be the hardest thing of all.</p><p>“You actually need to do some reasoning to decide: is this thing plausible? Is this source legitimate? You have to do things like a human fact checker might do, that actually might require artificial general intelligence,” Marcus said. And Marcus and Meta’s AI chief Yann LeCun <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/23fab126-f1d3-4add-a457-207a25730ad9">both agree</a> that the large language models that power current AI systems like Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s GPT-4 will not be what creates AGI. </p><p>Look, it’s a tough spot for Google to be in. Bing went big on AI before Google did with Satya Nadella’s famous “<a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DKSixVG8Z5rQ">we made them dance</a>” quote, OpenAI is <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-develops-web-search-product-in-challenge-to-google?rc=mshudk">reportedly</a> working on its own search engine, a fresh AI search startup is already <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-23/ai-search-startup-perplexity-valued-at-1-billion-in-funding-round?embedded-checkout=true">worth $1 billion</a>, and a younger generation of users who just want the best experience are switching to TikTok<em>. </em>The company is clearly feeling the pressure to compete, and pressure is what makes for messy AI releases. Marcus points out that in 2022, Meta released an AI system called Galactica that had to be taken down shortly after its launch because, among other things, <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/metas-galactica-bot-is-the-most-dangerous-thing-it-has-made-yet">it told people to eat glass</a>. Sounds familiar.</p><p>Google has grand plans for AI Overviews — the feature as it exists today is just a tiny slice of  what the company announced last week. Multistep reasoning for complex queries, the ability to generate an AI-organized results page, video search in Google Lens — there’s a lot of ambition here. But right now, the company’s reputation hinges on just getting the basics right, and it’s not looking great.</p><p>“[These models] are constitutionally incapable of doing sanity checking on their own work, and that’s what’s come to bite this industry in the behind,” Marcus said.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://arunmani.in/articles/highest-two-power-to-divide-a-number/">https://arunmani.in/articles/highest-two-power-to-divide-a-number/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40475355">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>25 May 2024</p><figure><img src="https://arunmani.in/articles/highest-two-power-to-divide-a-number/cover.webp" alt="cover.webp"></figure><p>I recently read in a book that <code>x &amp; -x</code> equals to the largest power of <code>2</code> that
divides <code>x</code>. For example, <code>13 &amp; -13</code> is <code>1</code> (<code>2^0</code>), <code>24 &amp; -24</code> is <code>8</code> (<code>2^3</code>),
<code>14 &amp; -14</code> is <code>2</code> (<code>2^1</code>). Here <code>&amp;</code> means <em>bitwise <code>AND</code></em>. May be this is just
me, but after reading it, I was not able to understand the <em>reasoning</em>.
Obviously, <code>&amp;</code> is a bitwise operator and <code>2</code> is the base, so there is a
connection. But what is the connection <em>actually</em>?</p><h2 id="representation-of-negative-numbers-in-binary">Representation of Negative Numbers in Binary</h2><p>We should actually start with how numbers are represented in binary. In binary,
we have only two digits; <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>. To represent a number, we break it up into
a sum of powers of <code>2</code>. But each power should occur only once. So <code>13</code> is
written as <code>13 = 8 + 4 + 1</code>. If we include all the <em>missing</em> powers, then it
will be written as <code>13 = 1*8 + 1*4 + 0*2 + 1</code>. Now pick out all those <code>0</code>s and
<code>1</code>s before every power and write them in the decreasing orders of their power.
Hence <code>13 = 1101</code> in base <code>2</code>. I agree, this is a terrible explanation, but if
you contrast with how we represent in base <code>10</code>, that is, decimal, then it
should make sense. For example, <code>13 = 1*10 + 3*1</code>. Or better, prefer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number">Binary
number - Wikipedia</a>. Remember that
<code>2^0 = 10^0 = 1</code>.</p><p>Coming back to negative numbers, we have two ways to represent them, one’s
complement and two’s complement. Let us assume that all our numbers are going to
represented in size of <code>6</code> bits. So <code>13 = 001 101</code> (space for readability).</p><p>Generally, for negative numbers, you reserve the first bit for sign. So, if the
first bit is <code>0</code>, it means the number is positive, else, if it is <code>1</code>, then the
number is negative. Effectively, by this reservation, you are left with only
five bits for the magnitude of the number, so we can only represent numbers from
<code>-32</code> to <code>+31</code> (inclusive).</p><h3 id="ones-complement">One’s Complement</h3><p>In one’s complement, to store a negative number, you invert all the bits in the
positive representation of the number.</p><p>Take <code>-13</code>. With six bits, binary-form of <code>13</code> is <code>001 101</code>. Inverting the bits
gives <code>110 010</code>.</p><h3 id="twos-complement">Two’s Complement</h3><p>In two’s complement, we invert all the bits of the number and then add <code>1</code>.</p><p>So for <code>13</code>, inverting all the bits gives <code>110 010</code>. Now add <code>1</code> to it.
Therefore <code>-13</code> in two’s complement is <code>110 011</code>.</p><p>Or in other words, we find the one’s complement and add <code>1</code> to it.</p><p>Coming back to our original concern, <code>x &amp; -x</code> gives you the largest power of <code>2</code>
that divides <code>x</code> only when <code>-x</code> is represented in two’s complement.</p><p>Thankfully, two’s complement is the most used format, at least in computers, as
per <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signed_number_representations">Signed number representations -
Wikipedia</a>.</p><blockquote><p>There is no definitive criterion by which any of the representations is
universally superior. <em>For integers, the representation used in most current
computing devices is two’s complement</em>, although the Unisys ClearPath Dorado
series mainframes use ones’ complement.</p></blockquote><h2 id="largest-power-of-2">Largest Power of 2</h2><p>We have a nice <em>mathemagical</em> property involving the largest power of <code>b</code> in
base <code>b</code> format.</p><p>In decimal, if a number is followed by <code>k</code> zeroes, then it is divisible by
<code>10^k</code>. For example, <code>1305200</code> is divisible by <code>100</code>, that is, <code>10^2</code>.</p><p>The same happens in binary too. <code>110 000</code> (<code>48</code>) is divisible by <code>10 000</code> (<code>16</code>),
that is, <code>2^4</code>.</p><h2 id="decoding-x---x">Decoding <code>x &amp; -x</code></h2><p>Having understood the above sections (you did right 😿?), we can now decode <code>x &amp; -x</code>.</p><p>From the previous section, we can say <code>x &amp; -x</code> gives you a number <code>y</code> whose
binary representation ends with <code>k</code> number of consecutive zeroes such that <code>y = 2^k</code> divides <code>x</code>.</p><p>Now we can rephrase our question as <em>why does <code>x &amp; -x</code> give you a number whose
binary representation ends with <code>k</code> number of consecutive zeroes?</em></p><p>Or more directly, we can say, <code>x</code> ends with <code>k</code> number of consecutive zeroes. So
we need to do some operation, which can give us a number whose binary form is
<code>100...{k number of zeroes}</code>.</p><p>The above statement is our ultimate clue and <code>-x</code> is the crux of the operation.</p><p>Say <code>x</code> ends with <code>k</code> zeroes. This means in binary, the number is like the
following.</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>x = VARIABLE_PART 1 CONSTANT_PART
</code></pre><p>Here <code>VARIABLE_PART</code> means a stream of <code>0</code>s and <code>1</code>s, we don’t care about
actually. <code>CONSTANT_PART</code> is a group of <code>k</code> number of zeroes. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p><p>Now take <code>-x</code>. Remember how <code>-x</code> in two’s complement is equal to one’s
complement of <code>x</code> plus <code>1</code>?</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>-x = INVERT(VARIABLE_PART) INVERT(1) INVERT(CONSTANT_PART) + 1
</code></pre><p>Ignore <code>INVERT(VARIABLE_PART)</code>. It can be anything and is none of our concern.
But look at <code>INVERT(CONSTANT_PART)</code>. We know <code>CONSTANT_PART</code> is a collection of
<code>k</code> zeroes. So what happens when you invert them? They become a collection of
<code>k</code> ones!</p><p>Okay, so what happens when you add <code>1</code> to a collection of <code>k</code> ones? You will get
a number whose binary form has <code>1</code> followed by <code>k</code> zeroes.</p><pre tabindex="0"><code> 111...k 1s...111 
 +              1
-----------------
1000...k 0s...000
</code></pre><p>But in our case, as we have <code>INVERT(VARIABLE_PART) INVERT(1)</code> as the prefix, the
<em>carry</em> <code>1</code> generated by adding <code>1</code> to a <code>k</code> number of ones, will be added to
<code>INVERT(1)</code>.</p><p><code>INVERT(1)</code> is <code>0</code>, so <code>0 + 1</code> equals <code>1</code>. Effectively this means, <code>-x</code> is like
the following.</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>-x =
     INVERT(VARIABLE_PART) INVERT(1) INVERT(CONSTANT_PART) 
     +                                                   1
     -----------------------------------------------------

     +                                                   1
     -----------------------------------------------------
   = INVERT(VARIABLE_PART) INVERT(1) 000000...k 0s...00000
     +                            1 (from carry)
     -----------------------------------------------------

     -----------------------------------------------------
   = INVERT(VARIABLE_PART)        1  000000...k 0s...00000
</code></pre><p>Phew that was quite long (at least to type out). Now we just need to bitwise
<code>AND</code> the result with <code>x</code>. So <code>x &amp; -x</code> is like the following.</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>x  = VARIABLE_PART                1         CONSTANT_PART
   = VARIABLE_PART                1  000000...k 0s...00000

-x = INVERT(VARIABLE_PART) INVERT(1) INVERT(CONSTANT_PART) + 1 
   = INVERT(VARIABLE_PART)        1  000000...k 0s...00000

 x = VARIABLE_PART         1 000000...k 0s...00000

</code></pre><p>Observe how <code>VARIABLE_PART &amp; INVERT(VARIABLE_PART)</code> neatly cancels to a bunch of
zeroes. The remaining number we have got is a <code>1</code> followed by <code>k</code> number of
zeroes. That is, we got <code>2^k</code> 😎.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>There are <em>numerous numeric</em> properties we take for granted but there are a few
which are like <em>wait, what?!</em>. I don’t know about you, but when I first read
about <code>x &amp; -x</code>, my brain went through an infinite loop, wondering why. I was
able to understand the reasoning only after thinking about how two’s complement
forms the base of logic.</p><p>Do you know that two’s complement of <code>x</code> equals <code>2^N - x</code>, where <code>N</code> is the
number of bits for storage? Can you guess why <code>2^N - x</code> equals one’s complement
plus <code>1</code>?</p><p>Hope you enjoyed reading. Please let me know of your thoughts and my mistakes
via the links in the footer. Sorry if I went a bit off.</p><h2 id="notes">Notes</h2></article></div>]]></description>
