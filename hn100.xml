<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Google has been gradually rolling out Chrome's "Enhanced Ad Privacy." That's the technology that, unless switched off, allows websites to target the user with adverts tuned to their online activities and interests based on their browser histories.</p>
<p>A popup announcing this functionality has been appearing for some folks since the July release of Chrome 115, which <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/27/google_tweaks_topics_api_ahead/">included support</a> for Google's Topics API, which is part of the tech titan's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/20/google_privacy_sandbox_july/">Privacy Sandbox project</a>.</p>
<p>It would appear more and more people are now seeing this popup as those not keen on Chrome mining their browsing histories to support Google's advertising profits have been speaking up. We understand a small percentage of Chrome's users are being pulled into the Topics API regime at a time, so you may not have noticed or been offered or alerted to anything. And how the Chocolate Factory asks you to agree to or accept the ad targeting depends on where you live, or rather, the laws of where you live.</p>

    

<p>Google next year aims to drop support for third-party cookies, which store browser data that ad companies use for tracking and analytics – to the frequent detriment of user privacy. The US mega-corp has developed a variety of replacement technologies, such as the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/privacy-sandbox/topics/">Topics API</a> that will allow ad targeting to continue without cookie-based tracking and – it's claimed – no privacy consequences.</p>

        


        

<p>Topics essentially works like this: rather than using cookies to track people around the web and figure out their interests from the sites they visit and the apps they use, websites can ask Chrome directly, via its Topics JavaScript API, what sort of things the user is interested in, and then display ads based on that. Chrome picks these topics of interest from studying the user's browser history.</p>
<p>So if you visit lots of financial websites, one of your Chrome-selected topics may be "investing." If a site you visit queries the Topics API, it may learn of this interest from Chrome and decide to serve you an advert about bonds or retirement funds. It also means websites can fetch your online interests straight from your browser.</p>

        

<p>Some people presented with the notification of the new regime complain it's a dark pattern –&nbsp;a term Googlers consider unfairly provocative – as Chrome users may think they're accepting or enabling "enhanced" privacy from ads when in actual fact the Topics API is already enabled, and will remain enabled, and has to be disabled in the browser's settings. That is to say: the popup is a notice that you've been opted in with a little link to your settings to disable the tech if you so wish.</p>

</div>
<p>Will Dormann, a software vulnerability analyst with the Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute's CERT Coordination Center, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/wdormann/status/1695843146842664997">noted</a> last week that Google's popup provides a default "Got It" button that dismisses the popup pane and does "the exact opposite of what the title text describes" – it leaves Chrome's ad targeting based on browsing history active.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that this popup does explicitly say, "you can make changes in Chrome settings," and that you can switch off the Topics API support using those linked controls. It otherwise doesn't change the status quo. Where third-party cookies were previously used to deliver targeted ads, Chrome users also had to take steps to disable them.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there's more push back now against the norms preferred by Google and other ad industry firms.</p>
<p>Matthew Green, a cryptography professor at Johns Hopkins University in the US, just encountered the popup and <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/matthew_d_green/status/1698813531062185996">expressed his dismay</a>.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>I definitely don’t want my browser sharing any function of my browsing history with every random website I visit</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"I don’t want my browser keeping track of my browsing history to help serve me ads, and I definitely don’t want my browser sharing any function of my browsing history with every random website I visit," he said <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/matthew_d_green/status/1699020653196661144?s=20">via Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>And VC Paul Graham has derided ad targeting tech <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1699021936573940154?s=20">as spyware</a>.</p>

        

<p>Google has offered repeated reassurances that its <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/patcg-individual-drafts/topics">Topics API</a> does not allow companies to identify those whose interests inform its ad API. But some developers <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/patcg-individual-drafts/topics/issues/74">claim</a> Topics may be useful for browser fingerprinting and both <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/WebKit/standards-positions/issues/111#issuecomment-1359609317">Apple</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/issues/622">Mozilla</a> have said they won't adopt Topics due to privacy concerns.</p>
<p>Google's popup appears to have regional variations that make the call to action and the button labels clearer and more consistent. One version that's been <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/supersat/status/1698826450567323754">reported</a> is titled "Turn on an ad privacy feature" and there's a button that says, "Turn it on."</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/20/google_privacy_sandbox_july/">Privacy Sandbox, Google's answer to third-party cookies, promised within months</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/02/01/google_cookie_sandbox/">Google ready to kick the cookie habit by Q3 2024, for real this time</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/27/google_tweaks_topics_api_ahead/">Google asks websites to kindly not break its shiny new targeted-advertising API</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/11/chrome_extension_developer_pressure/">Maker of Chrome extension with 300,000+ users tells of constant pressure to sell out</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike the highlighted "Got It" button cited by Dormann and its unadorned "Settings" companion that defers any decision until the linked menu is loaded, "Turn it on" in this variant menu is the same color as the "No thanks" alternative and performs the action suggested by the popup title.</p>
<p>This variation reflects different legal regimes. Unlike America, where opt-out is acceptable and opt-in requirements are broadly opposed by marketers, EU data privacy rules are more demanding in the way data choices are presented.</p>
<p>So if you see a pop-up with "Got It," you've probably been opted-in, based on where you are, and you need to turn off the Topics API support in your Chrome settings if you don't like it; and if you have the option to "Turn it on," you're being asked to opt in or out as you're in a region that requires it.</p>
<p>Depending on what Chrome version you're using, and whether you've been selected to start using Topics API, you can switch this functionality off and on by visiting <code>chrome://settings/adPrivacy</code> and/or <code>chrome://settings/privacySandbox</code> – cut'n'paste these URLs into your address bar to jump straight to the controls.</p>

</div>
<p>"Users in the UK, EEA, and Switzerland who have not already opted out of the Chrome trials will be presented with an invitation to participate in Topics, and manage their participation in Measurement and Protected Audience (formerly FLEDGE)," Google explained to <em>The Register</em>.</p>
<p>"All users will have robust controls, and can make individual choices, per API, at any point. Chrome will continue to evolve the user controls carefully and in consultation with regulators, and will have more to share once they've evaluated this initial rollout to a small percentage of users. All users will have robust controls, and can opt out of eligibility for the trials at any point." ®</p>

<h3>Droidnote</h3>

<p>Meanwhile, Android 14, which is set to be released later this month, is separating <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA">CA certificates</a> from the operating system image so they can be updated remotely without an OS update.</p>

<p>As noted by Tim Perry, creator of the open source HTTP Toolkit, in a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://httptoolkit.com/blog/android-14-breaks-system-certificate-installation/">blog post</a>, while this is a worthwhile defense against untrustworthy Certificate Authorities, its design will make life more difficult for developers and security researchers.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately though, despite those sensible goals, the reality of the implementation has serious consequences: system CA certificates are no longer loaded from /system, and when using root access to either directly modify or mount over the new location on disk, all changes are ignored by all apps on the device," wrote Perry. "Uh oh."</p>

<p><em>The Register</em> asked Perry to elaborate and he explained that this doesn't mean much for alternative Android distributions like LineageOS and GrapheneOS because they can disable this feature if necessary.</p>

<p>"This will most seriously affect security &amp; privacy researchers and reverse engineers, who all need to be able to inspect traffic from third-party apps to fully understand the apps' behavior," he said. "[It] will also cause daily practical problems for the many Android developers &amp; testers who use HTTP debugging tools like HTTP Toolkit and others with their own applications. In the development case, it adds significant friction, but it's possible to work around this for your own single app with more complex setup work."</p>

<p>Perry said the change will be a huge problem for security researchers who will have to rely on alternative versions of Android that don't have this change and which may not behave in the same way. And many apps won't run in these alternative Android builds due to protections like Google's <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity">Play Integrity API</a>.</p>

<p>Perry said that mobile devices have become increasingly locked down, and even on Linux, restrictions to tools like Flatpak and Snap are moving toward the sandbox model inspired by phones.</p>

<p>"The underlying reasons for locking down like this aren't bad – both desktop computers and mobile phones are huge targets for attackers, and this restriction and others like it will help to protect day to day users from serious risks," he said. "The issue though is that the needs of security and privacy researchers and developers are completely ignored. While it's important to protect devices by default, there need to be practical and officially supported mechanisms for advanced users who know what they're doing to override these protections."</p>

<p>
To mark the 10-year anniversary of the start of the Snowden revelations I will look back at some of the most notable disclosures and how they developed, based upon the most recent books and the numerous blog posts I have written here. Still, it should be noted that this overview is not a complete coverage of this wide-ranging topic.</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiyhZ8oMTZBwed-5n7dMj4FYGxNBxrR8NfDPbzx9Te6eeni5ePQDuNKSVPKfGm1TYMJTToHO19ZFzFVvLPJrgJ_yXPPbT06cJrAE7Nr2F5B_NoWy7aHGgdxlD6xqDPf4yy19JIbBk2TfBVZPPoiojdk039bRHMtNCmkzUuznUDeE24c_tEwqEhFaFH7/s800/10yearsnowden-header.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" width="620" data-original-height="420" data-original-width="800" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiyhZ8oMTZBwed-5n7dMj4FYGxNBxrR8NfDPbzx9Te6eeni5ePQDuNKSVPKfGm1TYMJTToHO19ZFzFVvLPJrgJ_yXPPbT06cJrAE7Nr2F5B_NoWy7aHGgdxlD6xqDPf4yy19JIbBk2TfBVZPPoiojdk039bRHMtNCmkzUuznUDeE24c_tEwqEhFaFH7/s600/10yearsnowden-header.jpg"></a></p>








<p><span size="+2"><b>Books and archives</b></span></p><p>

Between June 2013 and May 2019, the Snowden revelations resulted in over 200 press reports and more than 1200 classified documents published in full or in part. Additionally, The Intercept published 2148 editions of the NSA's internal newsletter <a href="https://theintercept.com/snowden-sidtoday/" target="_blank">SIDtoday</a>. In total, that may be well over 5000 pages.</p><p>

A collection that allows a useful visual recognition of the documents was found on the private website <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230220194734/https://nsa.gov1.info/dni/2020/index.html" target="_blank">IC Off the Record</a>, while text searches are possible at the <a href="https://grid.glendon.yorku.ca/exhibits/show/welcome-to-the-snowden-digital" target="_blank">Snowden Archive</a> which is a collaboration between Canadian Journalists for Free Expression (CJFE) and the University of Toronto. A private collection of the documents is also available at <a href="https://github.com/iamcryptoki/snowden-archive" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p><p>

There are also at least 12 <a href="https://www.electrospaces.net/p/books.html#snowden">books about the Snowden revelations</a>. Glenn Greenwald's <i>No Place To Hide</i> from 2014 reads like a pamphlet against perceived mass surveillance. A much more factual overview can be found in <i>Der NSA Komplex</i>, which is also published in 2014 and written by two journalists from Der Spiegel, but unfortunately only available in German.</p><p>

Detailed insights into the political and legal background of the NSA's collection programs are provided in Timothy Edgar's <i>Beyond Snowden</i> from 2017, which is in contrast to Snowden's own memoir <i>Permanent Record</i> from 2019, which leaves more questions than answers.</p><p>

Finally, there's also the long-awaited book <i>Dark Mirror</i> by Washington Post journalist Barton Gellman, which was published in 2020 and offers some important new angles to the initial stories told by Snowden and Greenwald.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhhtqJPTdbbQy4xiU_ry0G6brToakH7JMt1iDp1_smof7c6BOkXQ17WfJKTCTbT8H9FiCny4qPwqaior9yBUbj0RuI_QiBH0fqdy8cHuKD7IocRbpLR9tpstHvsNxtThbA5kyEhJUJjMeOpqxFQP7OqMLkf2MndGaJFBVEuKdRcCUisXuIJEe47c0Eb=s800" imageanchor="1" target="_blank"><img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhhtqJPTdbbQy4xiU_ry0G6brToakH7JMt1iDp1_smof7c6BOkXQ17WfJKTCTbT8H9FiCny4qPwqaior9yBUbj0RuI_QiBH0fqdy8cHuKD7IocRbpLR9tpstHvsNxtThbA5kyEhJUJjMeOpqxFQP7OqMLkf2MndGaJFBVEuKdRcCUisXuIJEe47c0Eb=s800" width="500"></a></p>


<p><span size="+2"><b>Incentives</b></span></p><p>

Some people assume that Snowden is a spy who worked for Russian intelligence, but nowadays, requests for information come from transparency activists as well. Wikileaks' wiki-page titled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090619014040/https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Draft:The_Most_Wanted_Leaks_of_2009" target="_blank">The Most Wanted Leaks of 2009</a> may have inspired Manning to search for information on SIPRNet and to download hundreds of thousands of military and diplomatic reports.</p><p>

Likewise, the incentive for Snowden may have come from the news program <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Now!" target="_blank">Democracy Now!</a>, in which on April 20, 2012, former NSA crypto-mathematician Bill Binney, documentary filmmaker Laura Poitras and hacktivist Jacob Appelbaum were interviewed by Amy Goodman (a full transcript can be found <a href="https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/sociopol_nsa05.htm" target="_blank">here</a>).</p><p>

In the program, Binney claimed that after 9/11 "all the wraps came off for NSA, and they decided to eliminate the protections on U.S. citizens and collect on domestically". </p><p>

Appelbaum <a href="https://www.democracynow.org/2012/4/20/we_do_not_live_in_a?autostart=true" target="_blank">repeated</a> what he said at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers_on_Planet_Earth" target="_blank">HOPE</a> conference in 2010: "I feel that people like Bill need to come forward to talk about what the U.S. government is doing, so that we can make informed choices as a democracy" - which is exactly what Snowden would do: leaking documents because "<i>the public</i> needs to <a href="https://youtu.be/0hLjuVyIIrs?t=300" target="_blank">decide</a> whether these programs and policies are right or wrong."</p><p>

Later that day, Binney and Appelbaum spoke at a "Surveillance Teach-In" in the Whitney Museum, where Appelbaum emphasized that disclosing secret information is also important for privacy and civil liberties organizations: because of a lack of hard evidence and concrete harm it was almost impossible for them to fight NSA surveillance in court.</p><div>

<p>

Just a month earlier, Snowden had started a <a href="https://www.electrospaces.net/2019/12/review-of-snowdens-book-permanent.html#sysadmin">new job</a> as a SharePoint systems administrator at the NSA's <a href="https://www.electrospaces.net/2019/06/the-nsas-regional-cryptologic-centers.html">regional cryptologic center</a> in the Kunia Tunnel complex in Hawaii. There, he began automating his tasks to free up time for something more interesting, which he describes in <i>Permanent Record</i>:</p><p>
"I want to emphasize this: my active searching out of NSA abuses began not with the copying of documents, but with the reading of them. My initial intention was just to confirm the suspicions that I'd first had back in 2009 in Tokyo. Three years later I was determined to find out if an American system of mass surveillance existed and, if it did, how it functioned." <a nohref="" title="Edward Snowden, Permanent Record, p. 214-215">*</a><br>
</p>
<p>
With this, Snowden basically admits that he isn't a whistleblower: he wasn't confronted with illegal activities or significant abuses and subsequently secured evidence of that, but acted the other way around, by first gathering as much information he could get and then look whether there was something incriminating in it.</p><p>

In his memoir, Snowden doesn't come up with concrete misconducts or other things that could have triggered his decision to hand the files over to journalists. He even omits almost all the disclosures made by the press, which makes that<i> Permanent Record</i> contains hardly anything that justifies his unprecedented data theft.</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WJHs31cb8nw/Xcu8fWiZdJI/AAAAAAAAENY/DVGBGU0tU94MYT-y5TJtdWekkmJmbgc9wCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/nsa-kunia-pict86.jpg" imageanchor="1" target="_blank"><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WJHs31cb8nw/Xcu8fWiZdJI/AAAAAAAAENY/DVGBGU0tU94MYT-y5TJtdWekkmJmbgc9wCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/nsa-kunia-pict86.jpg" width="500"></a><br>

</p>

<p><span size="+2"><b>The documents</b></span></p><p>

The actual number of documents which Snowden eventually exfiltrated from the NSA has never been clarified. According to the 2016 <a href="https://fas.org/irp/congress/2016_rpt/hpsci-snowden.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> from the US House Intelligence Committee, Snowden removed more than 1.5 million documents from NSANet and the JWICS intelligence network.</p><p>

Glenn Greenwald repeatedly <a href="https://theintercept.com/2014/05/08/keith-alexander-unplugged-bushobama-matters/" target="_blank">said</a> that number was "pure fabrication" and he could probably agree with former NSA director Keith Alexander who in November 2013 estimated that Snowden had <a href="https://technical.ly/baltimore/2013/11/01/surveillance-necessary-hornets-nest-nsa-director-keith-alexander/" target="_blank">exposed</a> only between 50,000 and 200,000 documents.<a href="https://rumble.com/v2sgyx2-snowden-revelations-10-year-anniversary-glenn-greenwald-speaks-with-snowden.html" target="_blank" title="As of 10:55 Greenwald speaks about hundreds of thousands of documents">*</a></p><p>

According to Barton Gellman, Snowden provided him and Laura Poitras with an encrypted archive of documents called "Pandora" on May 21, 2013. This archive was 8 gigabytes and contained over 50,000 separate documents, all neatly organized in folders.<a nohref="" title="Barton Gellman, Dark Mirror, p. 22-27">*</a></p><p>

Poitras gave Greenwald a copy of the Pandora archive just before they boarded their flight to Hong Kong on June 1. There, Snowden <a href="https://archive.is/Evmoi" target="_blank">gave</a> Ewen MacAskill from The Guardian some 50,000 documents about GCHQ and handed over all the remaining files to Greenwald and Poitras, who are the <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/snowden-and-greenwald-the-men-who-leaked-the-secrets-104970/" target="_blank">only ones</a> with a complete set. Other media outlets only got partial sets of documents.</p><p>

Greenwald's cache eventually ended up at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Intercept" target="_blank">The Intercept</a>, the online news outlet he co-founded with Jeremy Scahill and Laura Poitras in 2014 to report about the Snowden documents. In March 2019, however, The Intercept closed its Snowden archive and <a href="https://mmm.verdi.de/beruf/snowden-und-die-grosse-datenmisshandlung-89797" target="_blank">reportedly</a> destroyed it. </p>

In a message to Gellman, Snowden said that "he was not resigned to life in prison or worse. He wanted to show other whistleblowers that there could be a happy ending".<a nohref="" title="Barton Gellman, Dark Mirror, p. 129">*</a> Later, whistleblower attorney Jesselyn Radack <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2013/10/more-nsa-leakers-followed-snowdens-footsteps-whistleblower-lawyer-says" target="_blank">hoped</a> that "courage is contagious, and we see more and more people from the NSA coming through our door after Snowden made these revelations."</p><p>

Indeed, other sources started to leak documents to the press. The first one was a so-called tasking record showing that the NSA had targeted the non-secure cell phone of German chancellor Angela Merkel. This was <a href="https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/nsa-merkel-beschwert-sich-bei-obama-a-929636.html" target="_blank">revealed</a> by Der Spiegel on October 23, 2013, which is less than five months after the start of Snowden's revelations. </p>
<p>
The second leaked document that wasn't attributed to Snowden was just as spectacular: the <a href="https://nsa.gov1.info/dni/nsa-ant-catalog/index.html" target="_blank">ANT product catalog</a> with a range of sophisticated spying gadgets from the NSA's hacking division TAO. This catalog was also published by Der Spiegel and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy3-QZLTpbQ" target="_blank">discussed</a> by Jacob Appelbaum during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_Communication_Congress" target="_blank">CCC</a> on December 30, 2013.</p><p> 

Initially, hardly anyone noticed that these documents didn't come from Snowden, and so a mysterious "second source" was able to publish files that were sometimes even more embarrassing and damaging than those from the Snowden trove, like intercepted conversations from foreign government leaders.</p><p>

Later, other piggybackers who called themselves <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shadow_Brokers" target="_blank">The Shadow Brokers</a> leaked highly sensitive information about NSA hacking tools. The sources of these leaks have never been identified, although it's often <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2023/06/snowden-ten-years-later.html" target="_blank">assume</a>d that Russian intelligence was behind it. Snowden never addressed these other leaks, nor distanced himself from them.</p>

<p><span size="+2"><b>The Section 215 program</b></span></p><p>

The very first disclosure of a document that did come from Snowden was the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/jun/06/verizon-telephone-data-court-order" target="_blank">Verizon order</a> of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC). This court convenes behind closed doors and is often, but <a href="https://www.emptywheel.net/2017/06/28/confirmed-the-fisa-court-is-less-of-a-rubber-stamp-than-title-iii-courts/" target="_blank">injustly</a> referred to as a "rubber stamp". The order was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order" target="_blank">published</a> by The Guardian on June 6, 2013.</p><p>

The Verizon order showed that the NSA was collecting domestic telephone metadata under the so-called <a href="https://www.electrospaces.net/2015/09/nsas-legal-authorities.html#215">Section 215</a> program. In the US, this became the most controversial issue and initially it seemed to confirm cryptic public warnings by US senators Ron Wyden and Mark Udall, as well as the aforementioned claims by Bill Binney about domestic mass surveillance.</p><p>

In reaction, Director of National Intelligence (DNI) James Clapper started an unprecedented declassification effort and released numerous FISC and NSA documents about the Section 215 program on a newly created Tumblr site called <a href="https://icontherecord.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">IC On the Record</a>. </p><p>

This was meant to clarify a central misunderstanding: the fact that the NSA collects data inside the US doesn't mean they are spying on Americans. The NSA is still focused on foreign targets, but because they are using American internet services, it proved to be fruitful to intercept their data not only abroad, but at telecoms and internet companies inside the US as well (the "home field advantage").</p><p>

Accordingly, the purpose of the Section 215 program was to find out whether foreign terrorists were in contact with unknown conspirators inside the US, which was one of the failures that could have prevented the attacks of 9/11.</p><p>

Therefore, the only thing the domestic telephone records were used for was simple contact chaining: NSA started with a phone number of a foreign terrorist and then the MAINWAY system presented the (foreign and domestic) phone numbers with which that initial number had been in contact with, as well as the numbers they, in their turn had been in contact with, the so-called "second hop":</p><p><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FK7jUtlV9IM/VrrfHYPnSjI/AAAAAAAADCg/ji4VHF0HNVw/s1600/contact-chaining-federated2.jpg" width="500" title="Federated contact chaining queries including domestic and foreign phone call records"></p>

<p>

In 2012, the NSA used 288 phone numbers as a "seed" for such a contact chaining query, <a href="https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=261079074?storyId=261079074" target="_blank">resulting</a> in 6000 phone numbers that analysts actually looked at. When this led to a suspicious American phone number, the NSA passed it on to the FBI for further investigation.</p><p>

This true purpose of the domestic metadata collection was clearly laid out in a <a href="https://documents.pclob.gov/prod/Documents/OversightReport/cf0ce183-7935-4b06-bb41-007d1f437412/215-Report_on_the_Telephone_Records_Program%20-%20Completed%20508%20-%2011292022.pdf" target="_blank">public report</a> which the independent Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB) published in January 2014. The PCLOB found "no instance in which the program directly contributed to the discovery of a previously unknown terrorist plot", but the program was of some value as it offered additional leads and could show that foreign terrorist plots had <i>no</i> US nexus.</p><p> 

Although these domestic telephone records were not used to spy on Americans, and the FISC limited their retention to 5 years and prohibited the collection of location data, many people would not like to have them in an NSA database because of what Binney and Snowden called the possibility of a "turnkey tyranny".<a nohref="" title="Barton Gellman, Dark Mirror, p. 143">*</a></p><p>

The publication of the Verizon order did not only make the general public aware of the Section 215 program, but also gave civil liberty organizations standing in court, which fulfilled Jacob Appelbaum's wish from the 2012 Surveillance Teach-In.</p><p>

Meanwhile there have been two cases in which a Circuit Court of Appeals ruled about the Section 215 program. They both found that the bulk collection of metadata exceeded the scope of Section 215 of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act" target="_blank">Patriot Act</a> (because the actual practice hadn't been foreseen by lawmakers, although they had been briefed about it later). The courts didn't decide on whether the program was constitutional or not.</p>

<p><span size="+2"><b>The PRISM program</b></span></p><p>

One day after the publication of the Verizon order, The Guardian and The Washington Post revealed the PRISM program, which became 
synonymous for an all encompassing NSA spying system, just like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECHELON" target="_blank">ECHELON</a> was before.</p><p>

In his book <i>Dark Mirror</i>, Barton Gellman tells a different story than Greenwald did in <i>No Place to Hide</i>. Greenwald presented himself as the one who was chosen by Snowden to lead the revelations and claimed that he and Laura Poitras were working with Snowden since February 2013, while Gellman only got "some documents" and that Snowden was angry about the fear-driven approach of The Washington Post.<a nohref="" title="Glenn Greenwald, No Place to Hide, p. 54-57">*</a></p><p>

According to Gellman, the opposite was the case: on January 31, 2013, Laura Poitras already asked him for advice and on May 7, they agreed to work together. She introduced Gellman to her source, who still called himself Verax, and they started encrypted chat conversations. On May 20, Snowden sent them the full PRISM presentation, after which they signed a contract with The Washington Post on May 24.<a nohref="" title="Barton Gellman, Dark Mirror, p. 8-11 &amp; 138-139">*</a></p><p>

But Snowden was under severe time pressure and urged Gellman to rapidly publish the full PRISM presentation, which he had signed with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature" target="_blank">digital signature</a> associated with his Verax alter ego. Only gradually did Gellman realize the implications of this. Snowden's plan was to ask political asylum at a foreign <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consular_missions_in_Hong_Kong" target="_blank">diplomatic mission</a> in Hong Kong, where he wanted to use the cryptographic signature to identify himself as the source of the PRISM document (and didn't rule out to "provide raw source material to a foreign government").<a nohref="" title="Barton Gellman, Dark Mirror, p. 129">*</a></p><p>

As a journalist, Gellman protected the identity of his source, but publishing the digitally signed PRISM presentation would make him and The Washington Post complicit in Snowden's flight from American law. After consulting Poitras, Gellman decided not to do so. On May 27, Snowden withdrew the exclusive right for the Washington Post and turned to Greenwald, who until that moment didn't know who Snowden was, nor had seen any of the documents.<a nohref="" title="Barton Gellman, Dark Mirror, p. 128-139">*</a></p><p><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-KVB97E3pnWc/U1SNOMrZqSI/AAAAAAAABj4/hXu1tKvOJm8/s1600/prism-01-combined.jpg" imageanchor="1" target="_blank"><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-KVB97E3pnWc/U1SNOMrZqSI/AAAAAAAABj4/hXu1tKvOJm8/s1600/prism-01-combined.jpg" width="450"></a></p>
<p>

When Greenwald finally managed to get <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy" target="_blank">PGP</a> working, Snowden sent him a zip-file with some 25 documents, including the 41-slide PRISM presentation. Greenwald started writing his own story about PRISM, which was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data" target="_blank">published</a> by The Guardian on June 6, 2013.<a nohref="" title="Glenn Greenwald, No Place To Hide, p. 18-20 &amp; 75-76">*</a> Just an hour earlier, The Washington Post had <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/us-intelligence-mining-data-from-nine-us-internet-companies-in-broad-secret-program/2013/06/06/3a0c0da8-cebf-11e2-8845-d970ccb04497_story.html" target="_blank">released</a> its own PRISM story.</p><p>

The most controversial part of these stories was the claim that "the National Security Agency has obtained direct access to the systems of Google, Facebook, Apple and other US internet giants", which those companies vigorously denied.</p><p>

That "direct access" was taken from one of the slides, but it's unclear why both Gellman and Greenwald stuck to the most simple interpretation of it. Fact is that they had access to the extensive accompanying speaker's notes, which said: "PRISM access is 100% dependent on ISP provisioning".<a nohref="" title="Barton Gellman, Dark Mirror, p. 119 &amp; 124">*</a></p><p>

They also had all the other PRISM slides, including two that were published later on, which clearly show that the FBI is in between the NSA and the internet companies:
</p><p><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Ejp2lgqoEok/U3ksoG-pZ1I/AAAAAAAABnA/P2RTtvxQvKA/s1600/prism-14a.jpg" imageanchor="1" target="_blank"><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Ejp2lgqoEok/U3ksoG-pZ1I/AAAAAAAABnA/P2RTtvxQvKA/s1600/prism-14a.jpg" width="450"></a></p>

  </span>
</p>
<p>

In July 2014, the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board report (PCLOB) published an extensive <a href="https://documents.pclob.gov/prod/Documents/OversightReport/ba65702c-3541-4125-a67d-92a7f974fc4c/702-Report-2%20-%20Complete%20-%20Nov%2014%202022%201548.pdf" target="_blank">public report</a> about PRISM as well, which confirms that individual selectors (like a target's e-mail address) are sent to internet companies, which are "compelled to give the communications sent to or from that selector to the government." According to the PCLOB, PRISM "has proven valuable in the government’s efforts to combat terrorism as well as in other areas of foreign intelligence."</p>
<p>
In <i>Dark Mirror</i>, Gellman admits: "In retrospect, I do not love the way I wrote the [PRISM] story. I knew a lot less then than I learned later, with more time in the documents and many more interviews". A well-informed source told him that the systems of a company like Facebook are too complex to let the NSA plug in a cable. Only Facebook knows how to pull things out, which they can hand over upon a valid request.<a nohref="" title="Barton Gellman, Dark Mirror, p. 124 &amp; 148">*</a> Google <a href="https://eu.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/06/12/google-nsa-servers-secure-ftp/2416181/" target="_blank">did</a> that through secure <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol" target="_blank">FTP</a> transfers and in person.</p><p>

Another interesting addition provided by Gellman is about the date of the PRISM presentation, April 2013, which is less than one and a half months before Snowden left the NSA:</p><p>
  "Nothing Snowden had seen until now better suited his plan. He had been talking to Poitras for three months, but he still did not feel confident that his disclosures would seize attention from a public that had seldom responded strongly to privacy warnings. Most of the NSA programs that worried him were legally and technically intricate, not easy to explain. He needed examples that ordinary people would recognize. Along came [the PRISM] presentation, festooned at the top of every slide with iconic logos from the best-known Internet companies in the world. "PRISM hits close to people's hearts", he told me."<a nohref="" title="Barton Gellman, Dark Mirror, p. 120">*</a><br>
  </p>


<p><span size="+2"><b>Overcollection</b></span></p><p>

While PRISM is no mass surveillance, but targeted collection against individual foreign targets, it still has a problematic aspect: overcollection. Snowden was eager to draw public attention to this issue and, according to Greenwald, took his last job at NSA Hawaii only in order to get access to the NSA's raw data repositories.<a nohref="" title="Glenn Greenwald, No Place To Hide, p. 48">*</a> Snowden declined to repeat or explain that to Gellman though.<a nohref="" title="Barton Gellman, Dark Mirror, p. 84">*</a></p><p>

He succeeded and was able to exfiltrate a cache of ca. 22,000 collection reports, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/your-questions-answered-about-the-posts-recent-investigation-of-nsa-surveillance/2014/07/11/43d743e6-0908-11e4-8a6a-19355c7e870a_story.html?utm_term=.e6244eb277df" target="_blank">containing</a> 160,000 individual conversations (75% of which instant messages), which the NSA collected via the PRISM program between 2009 and 2012.<a nohref="" title="Barton Gellman, Dark Mirror, p. 340">*</a></p><p>

Snowden handed them over to Barton Gellman who <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/in-nsa-intercepted-data-those-not-targeted-far-outnumber-the-foreigners-who-are/2014/07/05/8139adf8-045a-11e4-8572-4b1b969b6322_story.html?utm_term=.676dfdc9ca3a" target="_blank">reported</a> about these files in July 2014. Researchers at The Washington Post found that the intercepted communications contained valuable foreign intelligence information, but also that over 9 out of 10 accountholders were not the intended surveillance targets and that nearly half of the files contained US person identifiers.</p><p>

It's probably technically impossible to prevent such overcollection, but instead of deleting irrelevant personal content, the NSA only "minimizes" it, which means that names of Americans are redacted before they are distributed. Gellman saw that NSA personnel takes these procedures seriously, but when he confronted former NSA deputy director Rick Ledgett with his unease, Ledgett's only reply was that the NSA really doesn't care about ordinary people.<a nohref="" title="Barton Gellman, Dark Mirror, p. 341-345">*</a></p>


<p><span size="+2"><b>The Mission List</b></span></p><p>

Ledgett's answer is confirmed by a comprehensive listing of the tasks of the NSA in the <a href="http://cryptome.org/2014/09/nsa-strategic-mission-list.pdf" target="_blank">Strategic Mission List</a> from January 2007. It was published by The New York Times in November 2013, but got hardly any attention, despite the fact that it clearly contradicts the claims by Snowden and Greenwald that the NSA has just one single goal: collect all digital communications from all over the world.</p><p>

Equally less traction <a href="https://archive.is/KnUS7" target="_blank">gained</a> reports by Ewen MacAskill from The Guardian and Scott Shane from The New York Times, who tried to provide balance and nuance by showing that NSA and GCHQ also did many good things, like monitoring terrorists, the Taliban, hostage takers, human traffickers, and drug cartels.</p><p>

The Mission List says that China, North-Korea, Iraq, Iran, Russia and Venezuela were "Enduring Targets", which means they are of long-term strategic importance and therefore require a holistic approach. Next there were 16 "Topical Missions", which are subject to some change, but can be considered legitimate targets for any large intelligence agency:</p><p>
- Winning the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT)<br>
- Protecting the US homeland<br>
- Combating proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD)<br>
- Protecting US military forces deployed overseas<br>
- Providing warning of impending state instability<br>
- Providing warning of a strategic nuclear missile attack<br>
- Monitoring regional tensions that could escalate<br>
- Preventing an attack on US critical information systems<br>
- Early detection of critical foreign military developments<br>
- Preventing technological surprise<br>
- Ensuring diplomatic advantage for the US<br>
- Ensuring a steady and reliable energy supply for the US<br>
- Countering foreign intelligence threats<br>
- Countering narcotics and transnational criminal networks<br>
- Mapping foreign military and civil communications infrastructure<br>

In 2013, terrorism was <a href="https://odnigov.tumblr.com/post/138558113835/dni-clapper-visits-us-naval-academy" target="_blank">replaced</a> by cyber attacks as top threat to American national security. Since then, cyber threats are increasing in frequency, scale, sophistication and severity of impact.</p>

<p><span size="+2"><b>Spying among friends</b></span></p><p>

For its mission of "Ensuring Diplomatic Advantage for the U.S.", the NSA intercepts the communications of numerous foreign governments and government leaders. Based upon documents from the Snowden trove, media reported about eavesdropping operations against the Mexican candidate for the presidency, Enrique Peña Nieto, Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff, the <a href="https://www.electrospaces.net/2015/12/how-nsa-targeted-venezuelan-oil-company.html" target="_blank">Venezuelan oil company PdVSA</a> and many others.</p>
<p>
The NSA's interest in Germany's chancellor Angela Merkel had the most far-reaching consequences. Merkel herself made clear to president Obama that "spying on friends is not acceptable" (<i>Ausspähen unter Freunden, das geht gar nicht</i>) and the German parliament started an official investigation into the spying activities of the NSA (<a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/1._Untersuchungsausschuss_der_18._Wahlperiode_des_Deutschen_Bundestages" target="_blank"><i>NSA-Untersuchungsausschuss</i></a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NSAUA?src=hashtag_click" target="_blank">#NSAUA</a>). This inquiry lasted from March 2014 to June 2017, but soon shifted its focus to Germany's own foreign intelligence agency BND.</p><p>

Extensive hearings of BND employees resulted in unprecedented insights into the details of the cable tapping and satellite interception operations which the BND conducted in cooperation with the NSA. Eventually it became clear that the NSA wasn't spying on German citizens, but did try to collect communications from European governments and companies of interest - just like the BND itself, which was also <a href="http://www.dw.com/en/germany-spies-among-friends-controversy-grows-over-espionage-activities/a-18844401" target="_blank">targeting</a> American and French foreign ministers, the interior departments of EU member states, and many others.</p>

<p><span size="+2"><b>Backdoor tapping Google</b></span></p><p>

A disclosure that caused outrage in Silicon Valley was about MUSCULAR, a collection program in which the NSA cooperates with its British counterpart GCHQ. In October 2013, The Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-infiltrates-links-to-yahoo-google-data-centers-worldwide-snowden-documents-say/2013/10/30/e51d661e-4166-11e3-8b74-d89d714ca4dd_story.html" target="_blank">reported</a> that under this program, the NSA had secretly broken into the main communications links between Yahoo and Google data centers around the world.</p><p>

A big question was: why would the NSA do that, given that they already had "front door" access to Google and Yahoo via the PRISM program? Gellman asked Snowden, but his only answer was: "Because it could" and: "I'm speculating, but NSA doesn't ignore low-hanging fruit". Eventually Gellman realized that inside the US, the NSA had to specify individual targets, but abroad it was possible to acquire such data in bulk and to search and analyse it with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XKeyscore" target="_blank">XKEYSCORE</a>.<a nohref="" title="Barton Gellman, Dark Mirror, p. 285-286">*</a></p><p>

The Post didn't mention the XKEYSCORE system by name and it's also not explained in Gellman's book <i>Dark Mirror</i>. That's unfortunate, because while Greenwald and Snowden presented XKEYSCORE as a global mass surveillance tool, it's actually a smart system to find targets who are communicating anonymously and therefore cannot be traced in the traditional way, via identifiers like phone numbers and e-mail addresses.</p>

<p><span size="+2"><b>BOUNDLESSINFORMANT</b></span></p><p>

Where Section 215 was most controversial in the United States, but lesser-known in Europe, the opposite was the case with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundless_Informant" target="_blank">BOUNDLESSINFORMANT</a>, which caused fury in Europe, but is hardly known across the ocean. BOUNDLESSINFORMANT isn't a system to collect data, but an internal visualization tool that counts metadata records to provide insights into the NSA's worldwide data collection.</p><p>

The results are shown in heat maps and charts, for example for countries and collection programs. Such charts for Germany and a few other countries were published on July 29, 2013 by Der Spiegel, but on August 5, the German foreign intelligence agency BND said that they collected these data during military operations abroad and subsequently <a href="https://www.spiegel.de/international/world/german-intelligence-sends-massive-amounts-of-data-to-the-nsa-a-914821.html" target="_blank">shared</a> them with the NSA. </p><p>

Despite this statement, Glenn Greenwald interpreted these charts as evidence of American mass surveillance on European citizens and started publishing them in major European newspapers.</p>

On October 21, for example, the French paper Le Monde published a <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/technologies/article/2013/10/21/france-in-the-nsa-s-crosshair-phone-networks-under-surveillance_3499741_651865.html" target="_blank">story</a> saying that "telephone communications of French citizens are intercepted on a massive scale." After a similar story appeared in Spain, NSA director Keith Alexander came with a remarkable clarification, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-security-nsa-idUSBRE99S03N20131029" target="_blank">saying</a>: "This is not information that we collected on European citizens. It represents information that we and our NATO allies have collected in defense of our countries and in support of military operations."</p><p>

Greenwald continued his framing in Norwegian and Italian papers. Only in The Netherlands it was <a href="https://tweakers.net/nieuws/92067/nsa-onderschepte-in-maand-metadata-1-komma-8-miljoen-telefoontjes-in-nederland.html" target="_blank">found out</a> that the BOUNDLESSINFORMANT charts were not about content, but about metadata. Dutch interior minister Ronald Plasterk, however, still followed Greenwald's interpretation and assumed the Americans were spying on Dutch citizens. A court case forced the government to admit that Dutch military intelligence had collected the data during operations abroad.</p>
<p>
It was only in May 2019 that <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/05/29/nsa-data-afghanistan-iraq-mexico-border/" target="_blank">The Intercept</a> put the pieces together and set the record straight: the various BOUNDLESSINFORMANT charts showed cellphone metadata that had been collected by members of the Afghanistan SIGINT Coalition (AFSC, also known as the 9 Eyes) and fed them into the NSA's Real-Time Regional Gateway (RT-RG) big data analysis platform.</p><p>

When The Intercept confronted Greenwald with this new research, he still <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/05/29/nsa-data-afghanistan-iraq-mexico-border/" target="_blank">tried</a> to blame the NSA: "At the time, Der Spiegel had already reported this interpretation, the NSA wouldn’t answer our questions, and they wouldn’t give us any additional information. I am totally in favor of correcting the record if the reporting was inaccurate."</p><p>

While Greenwald ignored the declaration by general Alexander, he was right when he said that the NSA's internal <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/jun/08/boundless-informant-nsa-full-text" target="_blank">documentation</a> about BOUNDLESSINFORMANT was somewhat confusing. Apparently, Greenwald had to rely on that documentation because Snowden was of little help, just like he was for various other programs that journalists did not fully understand.</p>

<p><span size="+2"><b>Truth</b></span></p><p>

Many of the documents that Snowden provided to the press have been misinterpreted or exaggerated, sometimes unintentional, but in other cases maybe deliberately. In <i>Dark Mirror</i>, Barton Gellman writes:</p><div><p>
"There were signs that Snowden was capable of an instrumental approach to truth. In conversations about my work, when I got stuck on a hard reporting problem, he sometimes suggested that I provoke fresh disclosures from government officials by pretending to know more than I did."</p><p>

"Another time he went further, proposing that I actually publish informed speculation as fact. If my story outran the evidence, he said, the government would be forced to respond and thereby reveal more. There would be a net gain for public information either way." </p><p>
  
  "He said misinformation from people like Mike Hayden, supporters of the intelligence establishment, pushed the terms of debate so far off center that only rhetorical counterforce could set the record straight."<a nohref="" title="Barton Gellman, Dark Mirror, p. 324-326">*</a></p></div>
  <p>
Gellman declined this approach because it would make his reporting unreliable and it undermines confidence in the press if it would turn out that certain things weren't true. However, claims made by Greenwald and Snowden himself showed that his "counterforce" method sometimes did work: the government came up with new facts - but those never got the same attention as the original story, which was already stuck in people's minds.</p><p><span size="+1"><b>Conclusion</b></span></p><p>

There's no doubt that the Snowden revelations provided unprecedented insight into modern-day signals intelligence as conducted by the NSA and its Five Eyes partners. </p><p>

In part this was much needed to understand how the legal framework is implemented and where safeguards need improvement. That, however, requires a close examination of the documents, which shows the problems are smaller and more complex than the mythical "global mass surveillance" which Snowden and Greenwald tried to proof.</p><p>

On the other hand, many things have been published that were merely sensational and weakened the US and its signals intelligence system. By revealing its workings and capacity, the Snowden revelations unintentionally set a new standard which other countries <a href="https://blog.erratasec.com/2014/12/snowden-made-things-worse.html" target="_blank">hurried</a> to catch up with.</p><p>

<blockquote>
<p>Summary: recently while fine-tuning a large language model (LLM) on multiple-choice science exam questions, we observed some highly unusual training loss curves. In particular, it appeared the model was able to rapidly memorize examples from the dataset after seeing them just once. This astonishing feat contradicts most prior wisdom about neural network sample efficiency. Intrigued by this result, we conducted a series of experiments to validate and better understand this phenomenon. It’s early days, but the experiments support the hypothesis that the models are able to rapidly remember inputs. This might mean we have to re-think how we train and use LLMs.</p>

<section id="how-neural-networks-learn">
<h2 data-anchor-id="how-neural-networks-learn">How neural networks learn</h2>
<p>We train neural network classifiers by showing them examples of inputs and outputs, and they learn to predict outputs based on inputs. For example, we show examples of pictures of dogs and cats, along with the breed of each, and they learn to guess the breed from the image. To be more precise, for a list of possible breeds, they output their guess as to the probability of each breed. If it’s unsure, it will guess a roughly equal probability of each possible breed, and if it’s highly confident, it will guess a nearly 1.0 probability of its predicted breed.</p>
<p>The training process consists of every image in a <em>training set</em> being shown to the network, along with the correct label. A pass through all the input data is called an “epoch”. We have to provide many examples of the training data for the model to learn effectively.</p>
<p>During training the neural network attempts to reduce the <em>loss</em>, which is (roughly speaking) a measure of how often the model is wrong, with highly confident wrong predictions penalised the most, and vise versa. We calculate the loss after each batch for the training set, and from time to time (often at the end of each epoch) we also calculated the loss for a bunch of inputs the model does <em>not</em> get to learn from – this is the “validation set”. Here’s what that looks like in practice when we train for 11 epochs:</p>
<div>
<figure>
<p><img src="https://www.fast.ai/posts/2023-09-04-learning-jumps/2023-09-04-09-00-35.png" width="350"></p>
<figcaption>Loss chart from training on pet breeds</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>As you see, the training loss gradually (and bumpily) improves relatively quickly, slowing down over time, and the validation loss improves more slowly (and would eventually flatten out entirely, and then eventually get worse, if trained for longer).</p>
<p>You can’t see from the chart where epochs start and stop, because it takes many epochs before a model learns what any particular image looks like. This has been a fundamental constraint of neural networks throughout the decades they’ve been developed – they take an awfully long time to learn anything! It’s actually an <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661323002036">area of active research</a> about why neural nets are so “sample inefficient”, especially compared to how children learn.</p>

<section id="a-very-odd-loss-curve">
<h2 data-anchor-id="a-very-odd-loss-curve">A very odd loss curve</h2>
<p>We have recently been working on the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/kaggle-llm-science-exam">Kaggle LLM Science Exam</a> competition, which “challenges participants to answer difficult science-based questions written by a Large Language Model”. For instance, here’s the first question:</p>
<div>
<p><em>Which of the following statements accurately describes the impact of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) on the observed “missing baryonic mass” discrepancy in galaxy clusters?</em></p>
<ol type="A">
<li>MOND is a theory that reduces the observed missing baryonic mass in galaxy clusters by postulating the existence of a new form of matter called “fuzzy dark matter.”</li>
<li>MOND is a theory that increases the discrepancy between the observed missing baryonic mass in galaxy clusters and the measured velocity dispersions from a factor of around 10 to a factor of about 20.</li>
<li>MOND is a theory that explains the missing baryonic mass in galaxy clusters that was previously considered dark matter by demonstrating that the mass is in the form of neutrinos and axions.</li>
<li>MOND is a theory that reduces the discrepancy between the observed missing baryonic mass in galaxy clusters and the measured velocity dispersions from a factor of around 10 to a factor of about 2.</li>
<li>MOND is a theory that eliminates the observed missing baryonic mass in galaxy clusters by imposing a new mathematical formulation of gravity that does not require the existence of dark matter.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>For those playing along at home, the correct answer, apparently, is D.</p>
<p>Thankfully, we don’t have to rely on our knowledge of Modified Newtonian Dynamics to answer these questions – instead, we are tasked to train a model to answer these questions. When we submit our model to Kaggle, it will be tested against thousands of “held out” questions that we don’t get to see.</p>
<p>We trained our model for 3 epochs on a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/radek1/new-dataset-deberta-v3-large-training">big dataset of questions</a> created by our friend Radek Osmulski, and saw the following most unexpected training loss curve:</p>
<div>
<figure>
<p><img src="https://www.fast.ai/posts/2023-09-04-learning-jumps/2023-09-04-09-33-39.png" width="500"></p>
<figcaption>Loss chart from 3 epoch training on Kaggle comp</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The problem here is that you can clearly see the end of each epoch - there’s a sudden downwards jump in loss. We’ve seen similar loss curves before, and they’ve always been due to a bug. For instance, it’s easy to accidentally have the model continue to learn when evaluating the validation set – such that after validation the model suddenly appears much better. So we set out to look for the bug in our training process. We were using Hugging Face’s <code>Trainer</code>, so we guessed there must be a bug in that.</p>
<p>Whilst we began stepping through the code, we also asked fellow open source developers on the <a href="https://discord.gg/k36qjUxyJC">Alignment Lab AI Discord</a> if they’ve seen similar odd training curves, and pretty much everyone said “yes”. But everyone who responded was using Trainer as well, which seemed to support our theory of a bug in that library.</p>
<p>But then <span data-cites="anton">@anton</span> on Discord told us he was seeing this curve with his own simple custom training loop:</p>
<div>
<figure>
<p><img src="https://www.fast.ai/posts/2023-09-04-learning-jumps/2023-09-04-09-39-06.png" width="500"></p>
<figcaption>Anton’s custom loop training loss chart</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>…and he also showed us this accompanying extremely surprising validation loss curve:</p>
<div>
<figure>
<p><img src="https://www.fast.ai/posts/2023-09-04-learning-jumps/2023-09-04-09-41-02.png" width="500"></p>
<figcaption>Anton’s custom loop validation loss chart</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Then we started hearing from more and more Discord friends that they had seen similar strange behavior, including when not using Trainer. We wondered if it was some oddity specific to the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685v2">LoRA</a> approach we were using, but we heard from folks seeing the same pattern when doing full fine-tuning too. In fact, it was basically common knowledge in the LLM fine-tuning community that this is just how things go when you’re doing this kind of work!…</p>
</section>
<section id="digging-deeper">
<h2 data-anchor-id="digging-deeper">Digging deeper</h2>
<p>The hypothesis that we kept hearing from open source colleagues is that that these training curves were actually showing overfitting. This seemed, at first, quite impossible. It would imply that the model was learning to recognise inputs from just one or two examples. If you look back at that first curve we showed, you can see the loss diving from 0.8 to 0.5 after the first epoch, and then from 0.5 to under 0.2 after the second. Furthermore, <em>during</em> each of the second and third epochs it wasn’t really learning anything new at all. So, other than its initial learning during the beginning of the first epoch, nearly all the apparent learning was (according to this theory) memorization of the training set occurring with only 3 examples per row! Furthermore, for each question, it only gets a tiny amount of signal: how its guess as to the answer compared to the true label.</p>
<p>We tried out an experiment – we trained our Kaggle model for two epochs, using the following learning rate schedule:</p>
<div>
<figure>
<p><img src="https://www.fast.ai/posts/2023-09-04-learning-jumps/2023-09-04-10-05-56.png" width="500"></p>
<figcaption>Learning rate schedule</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Nowadays this kind of schedule is not that common, but it’s an approach that saw a lot of success after it was created by Leslie Smith, who discussed it in his 2015 paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01186">Cyclical Learning Rates for Training Neural Networks</a>.</p>
<p>And here’s the crazy-looking training and validation loss curves we saw as a result:</p>
<div>
<figure>
<p><img src="https://www.fast.ai/posts/2023-09-04-learning-jumps/2023-09-04-10-09-29.png" width="500"></p>
<figcaption>Result of 2-epoch CLR experiment</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The only thing that we have come up with (so far!) that fully explains this picture is that the hypothesis is correct: the model is rapidly learning to recognise examples even just seeing them once. Let’s work through each part of the loss curve in turn…</p>
<p>Looking at the first epoch, this looks like a very standard loss curve. We have the learning rate warming up over the first 10% of the epoch, and then gradually decreasing following a cosine schedule. Once the LR comes up to temperature, the training and validation loss rapidly decrease, and then they both slow down as the LR decreases and the “quick wins” are captured.</p>
<p>The second epoch is where it gets interested. We’re not re-shuffling the dataset at the start of the epoch, so those first batches of the second epoch are when the learning rate was still warming up. That’s why we don’t see an immediate step-change like we did from epoch 2 to 3 in the very first loss curve we showed – these batches were only seen when the LR was low, so it couldn’t learn much.</p>
<p>Towards the end of that first 10% of the epoch, the training loss plummets, because the LR was high when these batches were seen during the first epoch, and the model has learned what they look like. The model quickly learns that it can very confidentally guess the correct answer.</p>
<p>But during this time, validation loss suffers. That’s because although the model is getting very confident, it’s not actually getting any better at making predictions. It has simply memorised the dataset, but isn’t improving at generalizing. Over-confident predictions cause validation loss to get worse, because the loss function penalizes more confident errors higher.</p>
<p>The end of the curve is where things get particularly interesting. The training loss starts getting worse – and that really never ought to happen! In fact, neither of us remember ever seeing such a thing before when using a reasonable LR.</p>
<p>But actually, this makes perfect sense under the memorization hypothesis: these are the batches that the model saw at a time when the LR had come back down again, so it wasn’t able to memorize them as effectively. But the model is still over-confident, because it has just got a whole bunch of batches nearly perfectly correct, and hasn’t yet adjusted to the fact that it’s now seeing batches that it didn’t have a chance to learn so well.</p>
<p>It gradually recalibrates to a more reasonable level of confidence, but it takes a while, because the LR is getting lower and lower. As it recalibrates, the validation loss comes back down again.</p>
<p>For our next experiment, we tried <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09820">1cycle training</a> over 3 epochs, instead of CLR – that is, we did a single LR warmup for 10% of batches at the start of training, and then decayed the LR over the remaining batches following a cosine schedule. Previously, we did a separate warmup and decay cycle for each epoch. Also, we increased the LoRA rank, resulting in slower learning. Here’s the resulting loss curve:</p>
<div>
<figure>
<p><img src="https://www.fast.ai/posts/2023-09-04-learning-jumps/2023-09-06-06-32-18.png" width="500"></p>
<figcaption>1cycle training over 3 epochs</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The shape largely follows what we’d expect, based on the previous discussion, except for one thing: the validation loss does not jump up at epoch 2 – it’s not until epoch 3 that we see that jump. However previously the training loss was around 0.2 by the 2nd epoch, which is only possible when it’s making highly confident predictions. In the 1cycle example it doesn’t make such confident predictions until the third epoch, and we don’t see the jump in validation loss until that happens.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that the validation <em>loss</em> getting worse doesn’t mean that we’re over-fitting in practice. What we generally care about is <em>accuracy</em>, and it’s fine if the model is over-confident. In the Kaggle competition the metric used for the leaderboard is <a href="https://www.fast.ai/posts/2023-09-04-learning-jumps/www.kaggle.com/competitions/kaggle-llm-science-exam/overview/evaluation">Mean Average Precision @ 3 (MAP@3)</a>, which is the accuracy of the ranked top-3 multiple-choice predictions made my the model. Here’s the validation <em>accuracy</em> per batch of the 1cycle training run shown in the previous chart – as you see, it keeps improving, even although the validation <em>loss</em> got worse in the last epoch:</p>

<h2 data-anchor-id="how-could-the-memorization-hypothesis-be-true">How could the memorization hypothesis be true?</h2>
<p>There is no fundamental law that says that neural networks can’t learn to recognise inputs from a single example. It’s just what researchers and practitioners have generally found to be the case in practice. It takes a lot of examples because the loss surfaces that we’re trying to navigate using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) are too bumpy to be able to jump far at once. We do know, however, that some things can make loss surfaces smoother, such as using residual connections, as shown in the classic <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.09913">Visualizing the Loss Landscape of Neural Nets</a> paper (Li et al, 2018).</p>

<figcaption>Loss surfaces of a ResNet-56 (Li et al, 2018)</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>It could well be the case that pre-trained large language models have extremely smooth loss surfaces in areas close to the minimal loss, and that a lot of the fine-tuning work done in the open source community is in this area. This is based on the underlying premise surrounding the original development of fine-tuned universal language models. These models were first documented in the <a href="https://aclanthology.org/P18-1031/">ULMFiT paper</a> back in 2018 by one of us (Jeremy) and Sebastian Ruder. The reason Jeremy originally built the ULMFiT algorithm is because it seemed necessary that any model that could do a good job of language modeling (that is, predicting the next word of a sentence) would have to build a rich hierarchy of abstractions and capabilities internally. Furthermore, Jeremy believed that this hierarchy could then be easily adapted to solve other tasks requiring similar capabilities using a small amount of fine-tuning. The ULMFiT paper demonstrated for the first time that this is indeed exactly what happens.</p>
<p>Large language models, which today are orders of magnitude bigger than those studied in ULMFiT, must have an even richer hierarchy of abstractions. So fine-tuning one of these models to, for instance, answer multiple-choice questions about science, can largely harness capabilities and knowledge that is already available in the model. It’s just a case of surfacing the right pieces in the right way. These should not require many weights to be adjusted very much.</p>
<p>Based on this, it’s perhaps not surprising to think that a pre-trained language model with a small random classification head could be in a part of the weight space where the loss surface smoothly and clearly points exactly in the direction of a good weight configuration. And when using the Adam optimiser (as we did), having a consistent and smooth gradient results in effective dynamic learning rate going up and up, such that steps can get very big.</p>

<p>Having a model that learns really fast sounds great – but actually it means that a lot of basic ideas around how to train models may be turned on their head! When models train very slowly, we can train them for a long time, using a wide variety of data, for multiple epochs, and we can expect that our model will gradually pull out generalisable information from the data we give it.</p>
<p>But when models learn this fast, the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6211">catastrophic forgetting</a> problem may suddenly become far more pronounced. For instance, if a model sees ten examples of a very common relationship, and then one example of a less common counter-example, it may well remember the counter-example instead of just slightly downweighting its memory of the original ten examples.</p>
<p>It may also be the case now that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.12848">data augmentation</a> is now less useful for avoiding over-fitting. Since LLMs are so effective at pulling out representations of the information they’re given, mixing things up by paraphrasing and back-translation may now not make much of a difference. The model would be effectively getting the same information either way.</p>
<p>Perhaps we can mitigate these challenges by greatly increasing our use of techniques such as <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/2627435.2670313">dropout</a> (which is already used a little in fine-tuning techniques such as LoRA) or <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09382">stochastic depth</a> (which does not seem to have been used in NLP to any significant extent yet).</p>
<p>Alternatively, maybe we just need to be careful to use rich mixtures of datasets throughout training, so that our models never have a chance to forget. Although Llama Code, for instance, did suffer from catastrophic forgetting (as it got better at code, it got much worse at everything else), it was fine-tuned with only 10% of non-code data. Perhaps with something closer to a 50/50 mix it would have been possible to get just as good at coding, without losing its existing capabilities.</p>
<p>If you come up with any alternative hypotheses, and are able to test them, or if you find any empirical evidence that the memorization hypothesis is wrong, please do let us know! We’re also keen to hear about other work in this space (and apologies if we failed to reference any prior work here), and any ideas about how (if at all) we should adjust how we train and use these models based on these observations. We’ll be keeping an eye on replies to <a href="https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward/status/1699216721473880425">this twitter thread</a>, so please respond there if you have any thoughts or questions.</p>

While the dominance of Internet platforms like <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/twitter">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/facebook">Facebook</a>, Instagram, or <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/amazon">Amazon</a> is often taken for granted, Doctorow argues that these walled gardens are fenced in by legal structures, not feats of engineering.

Sometimes it was tech platforms or companies and sometimes it wasn’t. Sometimes it was governments and sometimes it wasn’t. Having started off defending tech companies that really did have their users’ backs from entertainment companies, I realized that the distinction between them was not that one industry was made up of entertainment executives whose commitment to human rights was very thin and the other was made up of tech executives who had a more good-faith commitment. When a sector is extremely concentrated, the people who are willing to trade the public good and foundational democratic values for incremental increases in their employer’s profitability get a hearing within the company and take over the company’s decision making. When a business doesn’t have to worry about losing its customers due to abusing them, then the people arguing, “We shouldn’t do this because it’s wrong and <em>also</em> it’s bad for business” can only argue, “We shouldn’t do this because it’s wrong.” They have to grudgingly admit that it might be good for business. Any firm in that state eventually becomes a serious hazard to human rights. It’s this “curse of bigness,” as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Brandeis" target="_blank">Brandeis</a> called it, that we should really be attuned to and is really pernicious.</p><p><strong>That leads to the main proposal of the book, which is that reaffirming interoperability between systems and platforms can break apart these very large companies. Can you define interoperability?</strong></p><p><strong>Doctorow:</strong> At its root, it’s just the ability to use one thing with something else. Use any ink in your printer with any paper, use any socks with your shoes, anyone’s gasoline in your car, put any lightbulb in your light socket. There’s voluntary, mandatory interoperability, where a group of stakeholders get together and they say, “This is the goal we want all of our products to achieve, and we are going to design a framework so that we can make sure that every lightbulb lights up when you stick it in a light socket.” Then there’s the stuff where they’re indifferent: Car companies don’t stop you from putting a little cigarette-lighter-to-USB adapter into your car. </p><p>Companies can grow very quickly because tech has got these great network effects, but they also have, because of interoperability, really low switching costs.<strong>—Cory Doctorow</strong></p><p>Then there’s the third kind of interop, the kind of chewy, interesting, lots-of-rich-Internet-history interop, which is adversarial interoperability, which in the book we call “comcom,” short for competitive compatibility. It’s the interop that’s done against the wishes of the original equipment manufacturer: scraping, reverse engineering, bots, all of that gnarly stuff done in the face of active hostility. This would be like Apple reverse-engineering <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/microsoft">Microsoft</a> Office and making the iWork suite—Pages, Numbers, and Keynote—so that anyone with a Mac could read any Windows-based office file without having to buy any software from Microsoft. </p><p>There are so many examples of this from technology’s history. It’s really the engine of technology. It’s the reason we’ve had this incredible boom-and-bust cycle within tech companies. Companies can grow very quickly because tech has got these great network effects, but they also have, because of interoperability, really low switching costs. Anytime a platform isn’t suited to you or someone has a better idea for it, they can just make a tool [that] kind of greases the skids for you to leave the last one and to jump to the new one. Because of that interoperability, the companies that grow really big become irresistible targets for other companies that want to come in, tempt their users away, and offer them a very easy path to get from the old place to the new one. I think interoperability being interrupted explains “Why are tech companies bad when they used to be good?” It’s because the users can’t leave. If you can’t leave, they don’t have to treat you well.</p><p><strong>So how has tech interoperability become interrupted?</strong></p><p><strong>Doctorow:</strong> There are lots of platforms that have become, effectively, walled gardens. The argument is that the reason that these businesses are so sturdy, that no one has disrupted them or displaced them is that they have such good engineers. I get this from people about iOS all the time, saying “iOS is an impregnable vault, they’ve figured out how to stop people from doing it.” and I say, “wait a second—it’s a felony to try.” If I say I’m the world champion boxer, and no one has ever defeated me, but I can also send you to prison for five years for trying to take my title, how do we know how good a boxer I am? The question of why they use the lawyers and not the engineers, why their go-to is the lawyers and not the engineers, to me the answer is because the lawyers are much more effective at preventing a capitalized, motivated rival from figuring out how to bypass their technical countermeasures.</p><p><strong>So you’re saying it’s not technical dominance or business superiority or network effects that keep these platforms dominant; it’s instead the switching costs imposed by law. <strong>How could those laws be changed to make existing platforms more interoperable?</strong></strong></p><p><strong>Doctorow:</strong> One of the things I’m interested in is how to make a law you can’t cheat on. Facebook often proposes rules only they can follow. Rules for interoperability have two constraints: they have to be administrable and cannot constitute a capital barrier. For example, we can propose two different rules for Twitter [now X]. One would be an end-to-end principle, which is a rule that says: If I follow someone, and they post something, I can see it. That rule makes it really hard for Twitter to overweight content from its preferred suppliers. On top of that we add the Right to Exit. This is the right to leave Twitter without losing your followers and followees. This would be a mandate to stand up an API, and it would be, probably, an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/" target="_blank">ActivityPub API</a>. It’s a pretty good standard and its deficiencies can be remedied more easily than we can design a new standard. You put those two together, Twitter can’t keep anyone prisoner, and Twitter will have to treat the people who choose to stay well.</p><p><strong>You also argue that requiring interoperability will lead to something of a virtuous antitrust cycle. Is it that breaking down tech monopolies lessens their ability to reinforce the policies that have prevented interoperability in the first place?</strong></p><p><strong>Doctorow: </strong>That’s half of it. To understand the success of an industry in achieving its regulatory goals, you have to understand it needs two things. The first thing is power in the form of excess profits it can maneuver to lobbying. The second is unity.</p><p>Think back to the Napster wars. That was a sector of hundreds of small and medium-sized tech companies that in aggregate had more profit than the whole music industry and the whole movie industry. But the movie industry and the music industry had a smaller number of participants: music was five, movies were seven back then, now it’s three and four. As a result, they were able to agree on what to spend the money on. The tech industry was all over the place. They were knifing each other in the back. The reason the tech industry treats people like the music industry treated them 20 years ago is that unity.</p><p>The two benefits of competition are that it breaks the cash reserves that are used to enact public policy and it introduces the collective action problem that makes the remaining reserves harder to spend.</p><p><strong>How does that virtuous cycle then extend from tech into other sectors?</strong></p><p><strong>Doctorow:</strong> Think about what happened with the breakup of Standard Oil in the first part of the 20th century. Standard Oil was not the only trust. There were trusts for everything: whiskey, railroads, iron, aluminum, cars. Standard Oil’s dominance made people so hopeless about whether or not they could have an accountable government that the toppling of Standard Oil opened up a floodgate of political will that saw all of those other trusts shattered.</p><p>I want to go after tech because it has this characteristic interoperability that makes it a soft target. We start with tech, and that gives us the momentum, the credibility, and the political will to go after everybody else.</p><p><em>Cory Doctorow is an author, activist, journalist, and blogger.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
												<p>In November 2022, the password manager service <strong>LastPass</strong> disclosed a breach in which hackers stole password vaults containing both encrypted and plaintext data for more than 25 million users. Since then, a steady trickle of six-figure cryptocurrency heists targeting security-conscious people throughout the tech industry has led some security experts to conclude that crooks likely have succeeded at cracking open some of the stolen LastPass vaults.</p>
<p><strong>Taylor Monahan</strong> is founder and CEO of <strong>MetaMask</strong>, a popular software cryptocurrency wallet used to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. Since late December 2022, Monahan and other researchers have identified a highly reliable set of clues that they say connect recent thefts targeting more than 150 people, Collectively, these individuals have been robbed of more than $35 million worth of crypto.</p>
<p>Monahan said virtually all of the victims she has assisted were longtime cryptocurrency investors, and security-minded individuals. Importantly, none appeared to have suffered the sorts of attacks that typically preface a high-dollar crypto heist, such as the compromise of one’s email and/or mobile phone accounts.</p>
<p>“The victim profile remains the most striking thing,” Monahan wrote. “They truly all are reasonably secure. They are also deeply integrated into this ecosystem, [including] employees of reputable crypto orgs, VCs [venture capitalists], people who built DeFi protocols, deploy contracts, run full nodes.”</p>
<p>Monahan has been <a href="https://twitter.com/tayvano_/status/1648187031468781568" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documenting the crypto thefts via Twitter/X</a> since March 2023, frequently expressing frustration in the search for a common cause among the victims. Then on Aug. 28, Monahan said she’d concluded that the common thread among nearly every victim was that they’d previously used LastPass to store their “seed phrase,” the private key needed to unlock access to their cryptocurrency investments.</p>
<div id="attachment_64831"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-64831" decoding="async" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tayaug28.png" alt="" width="582" height="844"></p><p id="caption-attachment-64831">MetaMask owner Taylor Monahan on Twitter. Image: twitter.com/tayvano</p></div>
<p>Armed with your secret seed phrase, anyone can instantly access all of the cryptocurrency holdings tied to that cryptographic key, and move the funds to anywhere they like.</p>
<p>Which is why the best practice for many cybersecurity enthusiasts has long been to store their seed phrases either in some type of encrypted container — such as a password manager — or else inside an offline, special-purpose hardware encryption device, such as a Trezor or Ledger wallet.</p>
<p>“The seed phrase is literally the money,” said <strong>Nick Bax</strong>, director of analytics at <a href="https://www.unciphered.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unciphered</a>, a cryptocurrency wallet recovery company. “If you have my seed phrase, you can copy and paste that into your wallet, and then you can see all my accounts. And you can transfer my funds.”</p>
<p>Bax said he closely reviewed the massive trove of cryptocurrency theft data that Taylor Monahan and others have collected and linked together.</p>
<p>“It’s one of the broadest and most complex cryptocurrency investigations I’ve ever seen,” Bax said. “I ran my own analysis on top of their data and reached the same conclusion that Taylor reported. The threat actor moved stolen funds from multiple victims to the same blockchain addresses, making it possible to strongly link those victims.”</p>
<p>Bax, Monahan and others interviewed for this story say they’ve identified a unique signature that links the theft of more than $35 million in crypto from more than 150 confirmed victims, with roughly two to five high-dollar heists happening each month since December 2022.</p>
<p>KrebsOnSecurity has reviewed this signature but is not publishing it at the request of Monahan and other researchers, who say doing so could cause the attackers to alter their operations in ways that make their criminal activity more difficult to track.</p>
<p>But the researchers have published findings about the dramatic similarities in the ways that victim funds were stolen and laundered through specific cryptocurrency exchanges. They also learned the attackers frequently grouped together victims by sending their cryptocurrencies to the same destination crypto wallet.</p>
<div id="attachment_64829"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-64829" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/taygraph.png" alt="" width="250" height="653"></p><p id="caption-attachment-64829">A graphic published by @tayvano on Twitter depicting the movement of stolen cryptocurrencies from victims who used LastPass to store their crypto seed phrases.</p></div>
<p>By identifying points of overlap in these destination addresses, the researchers were then able to track down and interview new victims. For example, the researchers said their methodology identified a recent multi-million dollar crypto heist victim as an employee at <strong>Chainalysis</strong>, a blockchain analysis firm that works closely with law enforcement agencies to help track down cybercriminals and money launderers.</p>
<p>Chainalysis confirmed that the employee had suffered a high-dollar cryptocurrency heist late last month, but otherwise declined to comment for this story.</p>
<p>Bax said the only obvious commonality between the victims who agreed to be interviewed was that they had stored the seed phrases for their cryptocurrency wallets in LastPass.</p>
<p>“On top of the overlapping indicators of compromise, there are more circumstantial behavioral patterns and tradecraft which are also consistent between different thefts and support the conclusion,” Bax told KrebsOnSecuirty. “I’m confident enough that this is a real problem that I’ve been urging my friends and family who use LastPass to change all of their passwords and migrate any crypto that may have been exposed, despite knowing full well how tedious that is.”</p>
<p>LastPass declined to answer questions about the research highlighted in this story, citing an ongoing law enforcement investigation and pending litigation against the company in response to its 2022 data breach.</p>
<p>“Last year’s incident remains the subject of an ongoing investigation by law enforcement and is also the subject of pending litigation,” LastPass said in a written statement provided to KrebsOnSecurity. “Since last year’s attack on LastPass, we have remained in contact with law enforcement and continue to do so.”</p>
<p>Their statement continues:</p>
<p>“We have shared various technical information, Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), and threat actor tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) with our law enforcement contacts as well as our internal and external threat intelligence and forensic partners in an effort to try and help identify the parties responsible. In the meantime, we encourage any security researchers to share any useful information they believe they may have with our Threat Intelligence team by contacting securitydisclosure@lastpass.com.”<span id="more-64785"></span></p>
<h2>THE LASTPASS BREACH(ES)</h2>
<p>On August 25, 2022, <strong>LastPass CEO Karim Toubba</strong> wrote to users that the company had detected unusual activity in its software development environment, and that the intruders stole some source code and proprietary LastPass technical information. On Sept. 15, 2022, LastPass said an investigation into the August breach determined the attacker did not access any customer data or password vaults.</p>
<p>But on Nov. 30, 2022, LastPass notified customers about another, far more serious security incident that the company said leveraged data stolen in the August breach. LastPass disclosed that criminal hackers had compromised encrypted copies of some password vaults, as well as other personal information.</p>
<p>In February 2023, LastPass disclosed that the intrusion involved a highly complex, targeted attack against a DevOps engineer who was one of only four LastPass employees with access to the corporate vault.</p>
<p>“This was accomplished by targeting the DevOps engineer’s home computer and exploiting a vulnerable third-party media software package, which enabled remote code execution capability and allowed the threat actor to implant keylogger malware,” LastPass officials wrote. “The threat actor was able to capture the employee’s master password as it was entered, after the employee authenticated with MFA, and gain access to the DevOps engineer’s LastPass corporate vault.”</p>
<p><strong>Dan Goodin </strong>at Ars Technica&nbsp;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/lastpass-hackers-infected-employees-home-computer-and-stole-corporate-vault/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> and then <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@dangoodin/109950447675626971" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that the attackers exploited a known vulnerability in a <strong>Plex</strong> media server that the employee was running on his home network, and succeeded in installing malicious software that stole passwords and other authentication credentials. The vulnerability exploited by the intruders was patched back in 2020, but the employee never updated his Plex software.</p>
<p>As it happens, Plex announced its own data breach one day before LastPass disclosed its initial August intrusion. On August 24, 2022, Plex’s security team urged users to reset their passwords, saying an intruder had accessed customer emails, usernames and encrypted passwords.</p>
<h2>OFFLINE ATTACKS</h2>
<p>A basic functionality of LastPass is that it will pick and remember lengthy, complex passwords for each of your websites or online services. To automatically populate the appropriate credentials at any website going forward, you simply authenticate to LastPass using your master password.</p>
<p>LastPass has always emphasized that if you lose this master password, that’s too bad because they don’t store it and their encryption is so strong that even they can’t help you recover it.</p>
<p>But experts say all bets are off when cybercrooks can get their hands on the encrypted vault data itself — as opposed to having to interact with LastPass via its website. These so-called “offline” attacks allow the bad guys to conduct unlimited and unfettered “brute force” password cracking attempts against the encrypted data using powerful computers that can each try millions of password guesses per second.</p>
<p>“It does leave things vulnerable to brute force when the vaults are stolen en masse, especially if info about the vault HOLDER is available,” said <strong>Nicholas Weaver</strong>, a researcher at University of California, Berkeley’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/icsi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Computer Science Institute</a> (ICSI) and lecturer at UC Davis. “So you just crunch and crunch and crunch with GPUs, with a priority list of vaults you target.”</p>
<p>How hard would it be for well-resourced criminals to crack the master passwords securing LastPass user vaults? Perhaps the best answer to this question comes from <strong>Wladimir Palant</strong>, a security researcher and the original developer behind the <strong>Adblock Plus</strong> browser plugin.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://palant.info/2022/12/28/lastpass-breach-the-significance-of-these-password-iterations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a December 2022 blog post</a>, Palant explained that the crackability of the LastPass master passwords depends largely on two things: The complexity of the master password, and the default settings for LastPass users, which appear to have varied quite a bit based on when those users began patronizing the service.</p>
<p>LastPass says that since 2018 it has required a twelve-character minimum for master passwords, which the company said “greatly minimizes the ability for successful brute force password guessing.”</p>
<p>But Palant said while LastPass indeed improved its master password defaults in 2018, it did not force all existing customers who had master passwords of lesser lengths to pick new credentials that would satisfy the 12-character minimum.</p>
<p>“If you are a LastPass customer, chances are that you are completely unaware of this requirement,” Palant wrote. “That’s because LastPass didn’t ask existing customers to change their master password. I had my test account since 2018, and even today I can log in with my eight-character password without any warnings or prompts to change it.”</p>
<p>Palant believes LastPass also failed to upgrade many older, original customers to more secure encryption protections that were offered to newer customers over the years. One important setting in LastPass is the number of “iterations,” or how many times your master password is run through the company’s encryption routines. The more iterations, the longer it takes an offline attacker to crack your master password.</p>
<p>Palant noted last year that for many older LastPass users, the initial default setting for iterations was anywhere from “1” to “500.” By 2013, new LastPass customers were given 5,000 iterations by default. In February 2018, LastPass changed the default to 100,100 iterations. And very recently, it upped that again to 600,000.</p>
<p>Palant said the 2018 change was in response to a security bug report he filed about some users having dangerously low iterations in their LastPass settings.</p>
<p>“Worse yet, for reasons that are beyond me, LastPass didn’t complete this migration,” Palant wrote. “My test account is still at 5,000 iterations, as are the accounts of many other users who checked their LastPass settings. LastPass would know how many users are affected, but they aren’t telling that. In fact, it’s painfully obvious that LastPass never bothered updating users’ security settings. Not when they changed the default from 1 to 500 iterations. Not when they changed it from 500 to 5,000. Only my persistence made them consider it for their latest change. And they still failed implementing it consistently.”</p>
<p>A chart on Palant’s blog post offers an idea of how increasing password iterations dramatically increases the costs and time needed by the attackers to crack someone’s master password. Palant said it would take a single GPU about a year to crack a password of average complexity with 500 iterations, and about 10 years to crack the same password run through 5,000 iterations.</p>

<p>However, these numbers radically come down when a determined adversary also has other large-scale computational assets at their disposal, such as a bitcoin mining operation that can coordinate the password-cracking activity across multiple powerful systems simultaneously.</p>
<p>Weaver said a password or passphrase with average complexity — such as “Correct Horse Battery Staple” is only secure against online attacks, and that its roughly 40 bits of randomness or “<a href="https://www.omnicalculator.com/other/password-entropy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entropy</a>” means a graphics card can blow through it in no time.</p>
<p>“An Nvidia 3090 can do roughly 4 million [password guesses] per second with 1000 iterations, but that would go down to 8 thousand per second with 500,000 iterations, which is why iteration count matters so much,” Weaver said. “So a combination of ‘not THAT strong of a password’ and ‘old vault’ and ‘low iteration count’ would make it theoretically crackable but real work, but the work is worth it given the targets.”</p>
<p>Reached by KrebsOnSecurity, Palant said he never received a response from LastPass about why the company apparently failed to migrate some number of customers to more secure account settings.</p>
<p>“I know exactly as much as everyone else,” Palant wrote in reply. “LastPass published <a href="https://palant.info/2023/02/28/lastpass-breach-update-the-few-additional-bits-of-information/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some additional information in March</a>. This finally answered the questions about the timeline of their breach – meaning which users are affected. It also made obvious that business customers are very much at risk here, Federated Login Services being highly compromised in this breach (LastPass downplaying as usual of course).”</p>
<p>Palant said upon logging into his LastPass account a few days ago, he found his master password was still set at 5,000 iterations.</p>
<h2>INTERVIEW WITH A VICTIM</h2>
<p>KrebsOnSecurity interviewed one of the victims tracked down by Monahan, a software engineer and startup founder who recently was robbed of approximately $3.4 million worth of different cryptocurrencies. The victim agreed to tell his story in exchange for anonymity because he is still trying to claw back his losses. We’ll refer to him here as “Connor” (not his real name).</p>
<p>Connor said he began using LastPass roughly a decade ago, and that he also stored the seed phrase for his primary cryptocurrency wallet inside of LastPass. Connor chose to protect his LastPass password vault with an eight character master password that included numbers and symbols (~50 bits of entropy).</p>
<p>“I thought at the time that the bigger risk was losing a piece of paper with my seed phrase on it,” Connor said. “I had it in a bank security deposit box before that, but then I started thinking, ‘Hey, the bank might close or burn down and I could lose my seed phrase.'”</p>
<p>Those seed phrases sat in his LastPass vault for years. Then, early on the morning of Sunday, Aug. 27, 2023, Connor was awoken by a service he’d set up to monitor his cryptocurrency addresses for any unusual activity: Someone was draining funds from his accounts, and fast.</p>
<p>Like other victims interviewed for this story, Connor didn’t suffer the usual indignities that typically presage a cryptocurrency robbery, such as account takeovers of his email inbox or mobile phone number.</p>
<p>Connor said he doesn’t know the number of iterations his master password was given originally, or what it was set at when the LastPass user vault data was stolen last year. But he said he recently logged into his LastPass account and the system forced him to upgrade to the new 600,000 iterations setting.</p>
<p>“Because I set up my LastPass account so early, I’m pretty sure I had whatever weak settings or iterations it originally had,” he said.</p>
<p>Connor said he’s kicking himself because he recently started the process of migrating his cryptocurrency to a new wallet protected by a new seed phrase. But he never finished that migration process. And then he got hacked.</p>
<p>“I’d set up a brand new wallet with new keys,” he said. “I had that ready to go two months ago, but have been procrastinating moving things to the new wallet.”</p>
<p>Connor has been exceedingly lucky in regaining access to some of his stolen millions in cryptocurrency. The Internet is swimming with con artists masquerading as legitimate cryptocurrency recovery experts. To make matters worse, because time is so critical in these crypto heists, many victims turn to the first quasi-believable expert who offers help.</p>
<p>Instead, several friends steered Connor to <a href="https://noteforms.com/forms/flashbots-whitehat-intake-form?notionforms=1&amp;utm_source=notionforms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flashbots.net</a>, a cryptocurrency recovery firm that employs several custom techniques to help clients claw back stolen funds — particularly those on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p>According to Connor, Flashbots helped rescue approximately $1.5 million worth of the $3.4 million in cryptocurrency value that was suddenly swept out of his account roughly a week ago. Lucky for him, Connor had some of his assets tied up in a type of digital loan that allowed him to borrow against his various cryptocurrency assets.</p>
<p>Without giving away too many details about how they clawed back the funds, here’s a high level summary: When the crooks who stole Connor’s seed phrase sought to extract value from these loans, they were borrowing the maximum amount of credit that he hadn’t already used. But Connor said that left open an avenue for some of that value to be recaptured, basically by repaying the loan in many small, rapid chunks.</p>
<h2>WHAT SHOULD LASTPASS USERS DO?</h2>
<p>According to MetaMask’s Monahan, users who stored any important passwords with LastPass — particularly those related to cryptocurrency accounts — should change those credentials immediately, and migrate any crypto holdings to new offline hardware wallets.</p>
<p>“Really the ONLY thing you need to read is this,” Monahan pleaded to her 70,000 followers on Twitter/X: “PLEASE DON’T KEEP ALL YOUR ASSETS IN A SINGLE KEY OR SECRET PHRASE FOR YEARS. THE END. Split up your assets. Get a hw [hardware] wallet. Migrate. Now.”</p>
<p>If you also had passwords tied to banking or retirement accounts, or even just important email accounts — now would be a good time to change those credentials as well.</p>
<p>I’ve never been comfortable recommending password managers, because I’ve never seriously used them myself. Something about putting all your eggs in one basket. Heck, I’m so old-fashioned that most of my important passwords are written down and tucked away in safe places.</p>
<p>But I recognize this antiquated approach to password management is not for everyone.&nbsp;Connor says he now uses 1Password, a competing password manager that recently earned the best overall marks from <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/best-password-managers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wired</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/1password-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New York Times</a>.</p>
<p>1Password says that three things are needed to decrypt your information: The encrypted data itself, your account password, and your Secret Key. Only you know your account password, and your Secret Key is generated locally during setup.</p>
<p>“The two are combined on-device to encrypt your vault data and are never sent to 1Password,” explains a 1Password blog post ‘<a href="https://blog.1password.com/what-if-1password-gets-hacked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What If 1Password Gets Hacked?</a>‘ “Only the encrypted vault data lives on our servers, so neither 1Password nor an attacker who somehow manages to guess or steal your account password would be able to access your vaults – or what’s inside them.</p>
<p>Weaver said that Secret Key adds an extra level of randomness to all user master passwords that LastPass didn’t have.</p>
<p>“With LastPass, the idea is the user’s password vault is encrypted with a cryptographic hash (H) of the user’s passphrase,” Weaver said. “The problem is a hash of the user’s passphrase is remarkably weak on older LastPass vaults with master passwords that do not have many iterations. 1Password uses H(random-key||password) to generate the password, and it is why you have the QR code business when adding a new device.”</p>
<p>Weaver said LastPass deserves blame for not having upgraded iteration counts for all users a long time ago, and called the latest forced upgrades “a stunning indictment of the negligence on the part of LastPass.”</p>
<p>“That they never even notified all those with iteration counts of less than 100,000 — who are really vulnerable to brute force even with 8-character random passwords or ‘correct horse battery staple’ type passphrases — is outright negligence,” Weaver said. “I would personally advocate that nobody ever uses LastPass again: Not because they were hacked. Not because they had an architecture (unlike 1Password) that makes such hacking a problem. But because of their consistent refusal to address how they screwed up and take proactive efforts to protect their customers.”</p>
<p>Bax and Monahan both acknowledged that their research alone can probably never conclusively tie dozens of high-dollar crypto heists over the past year to the LastPass breach. But Bax says at this point he doesn’t see any other possible explanation.</p>
<p>“Some might say it’s dangerous to assert a strong connection here, but I’d say it’s dangerous to assert there isn’t one,” he said. “I was arguing with my fiance about this last night. She’s waiting for LastPass to tell her to change everything. Meanwhile, I’m telling her to do it now.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-body-content"><p data-label="Paragraph"><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rayleney/" title="null" target="_blank">Raylene Yung</a></strong> likes to say that her path into engineering management was in some ways gradual, and in others, a wild ride full of challenges at every twist and turn. Her first taste of life as an engineering manager came at Facebook in 2011, on what she describes as a tiny team. “It was three people — including myself,” says Yung. “The day-to-day wasn’t all that different. I was still diving into code, but balancing that with learning how to recruit and hold 1:1s.”</p><p data-label="Paragraph">Then the wild ride began. Yung had to strap in as her team took on more in scope, growing from three to thirty, and beyond. “I moved on from reviewing code to owning company metrics and building teams in multiple offices,” she says. By the time Yung left Facebook in 2015, she was the youngest engineering director at a public company with over 10,000 employees — several rungs up from where she had started, as a new grad at the then 700-person startup.</p><p data-label="Paragraph">Yung then took on a challenge of a different sort when she joined Stripe. “I wanted to see if I had what it takes to be a great leader in a completely different environment,” she says. (Spoiler alert: she did.) In her nearly four years at Stripe as it scaled up from 200 to over 1500 people, Yung built the product management team, defined career growth and recruiting frameworks, ran the core Payments business, and spun up the company’s global engineering hub in Singapore.</p><p data-label="Paragraph">Taking a front-row seat on two very different startup rides left her with a clear takeaway. “<strong>Personal growth is compounded by company growth</strong>. At Facebook, I focused on learning as much as I could from the experienced leaders who were joining as we grew. At Stripe, <em>I</em> was one of those leaders, tasked with figuring it out and teaching others,” Yung says. “I had to learn from piloting new internal programs, reaching out to peers and former managers for advice, and seeking out coaching and training.”</p><p data-label="Paragraph">She translated this crash course into a lot of heads down writing time, producing <a href="https://stripe.com/atlas/guides/scaling-eng" title="null" target="_blank">Stripe’s Atlas guide to scaling engineering teams</a>, as well as her own <a href="https://github.com/raylene/eng-handbook" title="null" target="_blank">handbook for eng teams</a> (which covers everything from 1:1s to performance reviews). After a decade of working at explosive growth startups, Yung left Stripe to take some much needed time off and carve out white space to continue sharing what she’s learned.</p><p data-label="Paragraph">And she’d like to train her focus on one subject in particular: <strong>career growth for engineers</strong>. “Most of the advice you hear is about advancing quickly, not stopping to soak up all you can,” she says. In this exclusive interview, Yung shares a collection of counterintuitive career lessons, the ones she learned the hard way. She also dives into why the IC and management tracks aren’t parallel ladders, but rather intertwined steps. Finally, she covers more specific roadblocks that can appear at every stage of your engineering career, as well as guiding questions that can serve as a gut-check as you seek to push them aside.</p><p data-label="Paragraph">With both broad lessons and targeted advice for different career phases, there’s plenty of wisdom to mine here. Whether it’s the young engineer peering around the corner to get a sense of what lies ahead or a seasoned leader trying to wrap their arms around increasingly thorny technical and managerial obstacles, Yung challenges <strong>every engineer to ask themselves the </strong><strong><em>right</em></strong><strong> questions as they plot out their careers</strong>.</p><h2 id="looking-for-advice-specific-to-your-situation-jump-ahead-to-yungs-career-tips-for-new-engineers-technical-leads-domain-experts-early-engineering-managers-more-seasoned-managers-and-engineering-org-leaders-and-get-a-helpful-rundown-of-her-advice-here"><em>Looking for advice specific to your situation? Jump ahead to Yung’s career tips for new engineers, technical leads, domain experts, early engineering managers, more seasoned managers, and engineering org leaders. And get a helpful rundown of her advice here.</em></h2><h2 id="three-critical-lessons-for-building-a-career-as-an-engineer">THREE CRITICAL LESSONS FOR BUILDING A CAREER AS AN ENGINEER:</h2><p data-label="Paragraph">There are some underlying themes that can carry you throughout your career — and these three lessons have been the foundation of Yung’s at every stage:</p><h2 id="1-strive-to-be-the-most-valuable-but-least-critical">1. Strive to be the most valuable, but least critical.</h2><p data-label="Paragraph">Most of us would probably be thrilled to be described as “critical” to a project’s success. But in Yung’s experience, that’s dangerous territory for an engineer to be in. Take this example from her time at Facebook. Yung had cemented herself as a company expert on posting permissions, but she was quickly about to discover the drawbacks of being the lynchpin.</p><p data-label="Paragraph">“I was training for my first marathon and had just finished a 20-mile run — only to discover that I was being paged for a live incident. I remember sitting in my bathtub fully clothed, somewhat delirious, with giant bottles of Gatorade in each hand and my laptop open, trying to figure out what had happened,” she says. “It was a high and a low point at the same time. I felt so important and needed, but all I wanted to do was rest and get out of the way. I vowed to immediately start transferring as much knowledge to my teammates as I could so they would have the tools to solve problems without me.”</p><p data-label="Paragraph"><strong>While you’ve probably heard the common working adage to “manage yourself out of a job,” Yung finds that phrasing too simplistic</strong>. For her, it’s less about making yourself obsolete, and more about making yourself less critical.</p><p data-label="Pullquote">When you’re critical to a project, you’re playing a decisive or crucial role in the success, failure or existence of something. As leaders and engineers, we’re all in this position at some point. But you can’t stay there. </p><p data-label="Paragraph">“When you’re valuable, you’re extremely useful or important — but not a failure point," says Yung. "The best engineers and managers are great at adding value, getting the most out of the people around them, and helping the team see around corners even when they’re not there.”</p><h2 id="2-want-to-succeed-as-a-manager-establish-an-emotional-equilibrium">2. Want to succeed as a manager? Establish an emotional equilibrium.</h2><p data-label="Paragraph">By now, it’s clear to most that <a href="https://firstround.com/review/this-is-what-impactful-engineering-leadership-looks-like/" title="null" target="_blank">forcing engineers to move into management is a mistake</a>. The challenge for most engineers is deciding if it’s a mantle they want to take on. “Although transitions into management sometimes happen quickly, think about it deeply and prepare as best as you can. Too many engineers plunge in, without exploring lightweight ways to try the manager’s hat on first,” says Yung.</p><p data-label="Paragraph">“I started by taking on more team responsibilities and onboarding new hires as a Facebook bootcamp mentor. I led a large technical project and got a feel for balancing engineering work against people leadership. By the time the project launched, I knew I wanted to invest time in becoming a good manager.”</p><p data-label="Pullquote">Management is not for the faint of heart. While being a great manager is really hard, it’s incredibly rewarding — and something I’ve chosen to spend many of my waking hours trying to get better at.</p><p data-label="Paragraph">Still, all the prep work in the world won’t ready you for the emotional challenge that lies ahead. “Most of the time, this is what I end up coaching new managers through,” says Yung. “As an IC, you don’t see the full picture of all the ups and downs managers have to deal with, so it’s easy to fall into the trap of thinking you’re ready — and then freaking out once you realize you’re not.” </p><p data-label="Paragraph">To help would-be managers get a better sense of what’s to come, Yung sketches out this chart on a whiteboard to give them a visual metaphor (<a href="https://medium.com/@emdashry/modern-portfolio-theory-for-management-variance-maximization-in-engineering-7dde7269e8a4" title="null" target="_blank">which she explains in more detail here</a>):</p><figure><img src="https://assets.proof.pub/2056/firstround/Z2caX5TlTY9P2TWpuMKg_The%20productivity%20journey%20of%20engineering%20life,%20IC%20vs.%20EM.jpeg"><figcaption>The productivity journey of engineering life, contrasting individual contributors and engineering managers</figcaption></figure><p data-label="Paragraph">“As an individual contributor, your job often looks like a local hill-climbing exercise. For most projects, you steadily make progress until you don’t. You’re either done and can move on, or maybe something went awry and your project was canceled or simply failed. Either way you get to start over from zero the next time,” says Yung.</p><p data-label="Paragraph">But engineering managers <strong>unlock the negative zone of this chart</strong>. “As an IC, I was a bit of a perfectionist. I thought in black and white, in designing systems, in exhaustively listing out all the edge cases,” she says. “As a manager, it took me a lot of time to realize you can't solve problems that way. People are not optimization problems — you have to accept there's a range of solutions and there isn't one true great answer.”</p><p data-label="Paragraph">Another observation: <strong>progress and feelings are no longer tightly correlated</strong>. “As an individual contributor, generally when you were doing well on a project you were making visible progress. As an engineering manager, you can work hard on something for over a year, only to see no progress in the short-term and <em>maybe</em> experience a big payoff in the much longer-term,” says Yung.</p><p data-label="Paragraph">All of that combined can bring your emotions down in ways you can’t predict or control. “Your mood will swing wildly. The larger your teams get, the greater the probability something is going off the rails at any given time. The crests and dips grow bigger and bigger,” she says. “The first step is being aware that <a href="https://firstround.com/review/give-away-your-legos-and-other-commandments-for-scaling-startups/" title="null" target="_blank">this is completely normal</a>. The second step is trying to establish more of an equilibrium so you don’t get knocked off course so easily.”</p><p data-label="Pullquote">Part of what makes experienced managers great is their ability to weather storms and normalize their own emotions to somewhere closer to zero.</p><p data-label="Paragraph">Yung cautions that engineering managers are also liable to develop what she calls split-brain syndrome. “You put on a mask. To your teammates or coworkers you feel this need to maintain an even, steady zero, but on the inside you’re going through these wild swings,” she says. “Don’t make the mistake of trying to handle this on your own. Some of my closest friends and mentors from work are the people I’ve been the most vulnerable with, and who have helped me become a much better leader.”</p><h2 id="3-focus-on-growth-and-learning-at-every-step-not-on-climbing-the-ladder-as-quickly-as-possible">3. Focus on growth and learning at every step — not on climbing the ladder as quickly as possible.</h2><p data-label="Paragraph">Even though there’s a lot of industry emphasis on ladders and levels, Yung’s no longer sure that’s the best way for engineers to think about their careers. “While companies have developed ‘parallel’ ladders between IC and engineering management tracks — and I helped with this very task at Stripe — I’ve since come to think of these engineering roles more as <strong>progressing along a pair of joint and often intertwined steps</strong>,” she says.</p><p data-label="Paragraph">Here are those steps as Yung sees them:</p><figure><img src="https://assets.proof.pub/2056/firstround/GXfYljTbTb69aOtPbUIM_Eng%20career%20guide%20-%20Raylene.jpg"></figure><p data-label="Paragraph">“We’re incredibly lucky that in engineering, unlike many industries, management is not the only path to growth. <strong>Despite that,</strong> <strong>too many believe that it’s a binary choice, that you’re locked into a path once you’ve started on it. In reality, the skills required to succeed as a technical lead or manager are much more connected than you think.</strong> I’ve seen first-hand that many people switch between these roles throughout their careers or even at the same company,” she says.</p><p data-label="Paragraph">“At Stripe and Facebook, I hired several ICs who were formerly managers and looking for a break from that role. The thing they all had in common was the ability to break down large problems and deliver on technical projects — everyone saw that in them, no matter what ladder they were on at the moment. That career flexibility is only possible if you’ve nailed the skills of being a great team <em>and</em> technical leader.”</p><p data-label="Pullquote">Management and IC careers aren’t strictly parallel paths — in practice, they criss-cross all over the place. But it’s only possible to toggle back and forth later on in your career if you put in the work early on. Push for the manager track prematurely and your technical lead chops may not be sharp enough to pull it off.</p><p data-label="Paragraph">In Yung’s experience, many engineers are focused on moving up the ranks as quickly as possible, asking questions such as, “How can I become a people manager?’ or “I’ve been here for a year, what’s next?” or “How can I get more headcount on my team?” to skip ahead.</p><p data-label="Paragraph">“Those are all questions centered around a desire to climb that ladder even faster. But that can be a rigid path to set yourself on, one that limits your options and flexibility in the future,” she says. Instead, Yung recommends engineers engage in serious introspection to deeply understand what motivates and excites them before moving on to the next step. </p><p data-label="Paragraph">“<strong>It’s about asking the </strong><strong><em>right</em></strong><strong> questions, the ones that keep you focused on growth and learning, not on moving up</strong>. My best teammates have been the ones who constantly pushed themselves to identify their weaknesses, systematically learn from their mistakes and get better,” she says.</p><p data-label="Pullquote">The best career advice I have for young engineers is to focus on learning instead of worrying about tracks and career ladders. That way, no matter what path you take as an IC, domain expert, engineering manager or even PM, you’ll only get better over time.</p><p data-label="Paragraph">In the sections that follow, Yung walks us through each of these career steps to provide tailored advice, outlining common mistakes that are all too easy to make, as well as the more productive questions engineers should be asking instead. Drawing on examples from her own journey, she guides us along the path from early engineer to the transition into management to the most complex and senior roles an engineer can hold.</p><figure><img src="https://assets.proof.pub/2056/firstround/SaOhxGjNQTqlcZ1Kh2sf_Raylene-Yung_189RT.jpg" alt="Raylene Yung, former engineering and product leader at Stripe and Facebook"><figcaption>Raylene Yung, former engineering and product leader at Stripe and Facebook</figcaption></figure><h2 id="advice-for-early-engineers-and-ics-how-to-set-yourself-on-the-right-path">ADVICE FOR EARLY ENGINEERS AND ICs: HOW TO SET YOURSELF ON THE RIGHT PATH</h2><p data-label="Paragraph">Many new grads (or those who came to software engineering later on) have eagerness, drive, hunger — and impatience — in spades. But that impatience can have unintentional consequences if it’s not channeled in the right direction, says Yung.</p><p data-label="Paragraph">In her experience, these three moves can knock early engineers off-course:</p><p data-label="Paragraph"><strong>Skipping engineering fundamentals to pivot into other roles prematurely:</strong> “I’ve seen people lose focus on their engineering work too soon, in hopes of becoming a manager or switching into another role like product management. Building a great foundation early on is critical in your career, no matter what function you ultimately want to end up in,” she says. “Don’t rush through the fundamentals at the beginning. There’s no real substitute for time spent with your hands on the keyboard.”</p><p data-label="Paragraph"><strong>Moving on from a team or company too quickly:</strong> “As a hiring manager, I’m skeptical of candidates who say some variation of ‘I’ve worked at X company for over a year, and I’ve learned everything I can so it’s time to move on.’” she says. “<strong>Sometimes the most interesting challenges only become tractable to you after a few years — you might be overlooking massive learning opportunities that come with staying in your current role</strong>. The best engineers are those who’ve taken the time to deeply understand a system or product and can apply their experience to a new problem.”</p><p data-label="Paragraph"><strong>Chasing the latest trend</strong>: “I get a lot of ‘How can I learn more about [insert cool technology here]?’ questions from early engineers,” says Yung. “Technology continuously evolves, and while it’s important to be informed about the latest frameworks and best practices, learning this at the cost of developing fundamental skills is a bad tradeoff. At both Facebook and Stripe, you can interview in the language you feel most comfortable in, on the belief that if you’re a good engineer, your skills will help you pick things up as needed,” she says. “You also don’t need to over-index on the new and shiny because what’s old can become new again. For example, when the Android platform first came out, no one really knew how to be a ‘good Android developer.’ Product teams were actually bootstrapped from infrastructure Java developers who were recruited over,” she says. “As it turns out, experience with parallelism and multi-threaded applications was far more applicable to Android than the single-threaded, asynchronous request patterns being used in the main Facebook web app.”</p><p data-label="Pullquote">Frameworks come and go, but core programming fundamentals — thinking through edge cases, debugging, the ability to learn new languages — are what stand the test of time.</p><p data-label="Paragraph"><em>Ask these questions instead:</em></p><p data-label="Paragraph">Instead of plotting future functional pivots, jumping ship after a year, or spending too much time on the framework du jour, Yung recommends leaning on these two tactical, guiding questions:</p><p data-label="Paragraph"> <strong><em>How can I make every code change a great one? </em></strong>“This might seem super tactical, but every commit is a building block in software engineering, and if you build confidence with every code review, you’ll move more quickly and take on larger challenges,” she says. “Conversely, if every pull request is a chore and you continue to make common mistakes, it’s hard to build credibility with your team. One of the most common pieces of practical advice I give to new grad engineers is to always review your own code before you submit it to others. Catch your own mistakes and quickly learn to not make them again.”</p><p data-label="Paragraph"> <strong><em>How can I be as good at [X] as [this person] on my team? </em></strong>“<a href="https://firstround.com/review/how-to-be-a-career-changing-mentor-25-tips-from-the-best-mentors-we-know/" title="null" target="_blank">Mentors come in all shapes and sizes</a>, and are always around you — identify what they’re best at and try to absorb their superpowers,” says Yung. Take this example from her first year as a new grad engineer: “I had two teammates with a lot more experience than me. <a href="https://hupp.org/adam/" title="null" target="_blank">Adam</a> came from a graphics background and was quiet in meetings, but wrote amazing code and reviews. He always spotted the flaw in my designs. Mark came from a product and business focused background. He spent less time on design but was an incredibly fast coder and thought through every edge case. I wanted to be as good at design and code review as Adam, and as good at product as Mark, so I vowed to get as much code reviewed as I possibly could by the former and get all my user-facing changes reviewed by the latter.”</p><h2 id="technical-leads-soak-up-all-you-can-to-build-a-strong-foundation-regardless-of-your-future-path">Technical leads, soak up all you can to build a strong foundation regardless of your future path. </h2><p data-label="Paragraph">After a few years of mastering the fundamentals, engineers are ready to move on up, earning titles such as Senior Engineer or Technical Lead. But as she alluded to earlier, in Yung’s experience, often engineers rush to move to the next level or switch into management.</p><p data-label="Paragraph"><em>Instead, lean on these four growth-focused questions to make sure the technical lead well you’ve drilled is deep enough to support future moves:</em></p><p data-label="Paragraph"><strong><em>Do I deeply understand the systems I work on, and how they can break or be improved? </em></strong>“This goes beyond knowing the ins and outs of the systems or products you own,” says Yung. “Let’s say you're building some new infrastructure used to launch your product in one country today. Not only do you need to think about maintainability now, but you need to think about what’s next. What if we need to launch in ten new countries? A hundred countries? What would break? How would your current design change? Pushing yourself to think through a wide range of scenarios helps you not only deepen your understanding of the here and now, but also helps you strategically steer into the future.”</p><p data-label="Paragraph"><strong><em>How do I know we are working on the right things? </em></strong>“Being a technical lead is not just about seeing around corners and solving problems with well-designed, scalable and well-tested solutions. Some of the best technical leads I know are the ones who can also tell you <em>why</em> what they’re working on matters, and why it’s important to do <em>now</em>,” says Yung. “This doesn’t mean you’ll always get it right, and some of the best ones will stop themselves when they go down the wrong path.”</p><p data-label="Paragraph"><strong><em>How can I build better people leadership skills? </em></strong>Regardless of whether you want to become a manager in the future, there are many ways to build team and people skills that will help you in your engineering career. “Start to own projects more holistically, taking into account not only the technical challenges but also the people side — understand who’s working on what and why, and how people work together,” says Yung. “Help less experienced engineers grow by mentoring interns and new team members. Work cross-functionally and think of your PMs and partners as your teammates. If you do want to become a manager later, this will help give you a much stronger sense of whether you’ll enjoy making the switch.”</p><h2 id="domain-experts-double-check-to-make-sure-you-arent-getting-trapped">Domain experts, double check to make sure you aren’t getting trapped.</h2><p data-label="Paragraph">Some engineers relish the opportunity to become deep-domain experts, particularly by staying in one part of the company or technical system. But especially as the years go by, check in to make sure you’re still growing and learning. “If you stop learning, you can become complacent and rely on your deep background to solve problems the way you ‘just know’ is right because you’ve seen it before. <strong>Not only have you stopped growing, but even worse, you may have stopped building the best solutions</strong>,” says Yung.</p><p data-label="Pullquote">As you advance in your engineering career, you’ll become an expert in a particular domain and feel as though you’re the “only one” who can handle it. That may be true, but if you’re burning out, it’s really not worth it — and you’re probably selling your teammates short.</p><p data-label="Paragraph"><em>If you find yourself at this point in your engineering career, ask these questions to make sure your deep expertise isn’t holding you — or your teammates — back:</em></p><p data-label="Paragraph"><strong><em>How do I keep learning and stay challenged? </em></strong>Look out for signs that your growth is stalling and push yourself to find new sources of inspiration from other people, teams or systems. “After years of working on privacy at Facebook, I knew how to do precise surgery on the existing infrastructure, but didn’t have any big new ideas on how to make things better,” says Yung. “Looking back, that was a red flag. The feeling of being essential, of being needed for my expertise had masked that gap. It wasn’t until we merged with another team that was working on an entirely different approach that I felt like I was learning again. This led to a great renaissance and a complete re-invention of our entire system.”</p><p data-label="Paragraph"><strong><em>How do I continue to show value when I’m starting over in a new area? </em></strong>Another barrier to growth is the fear that you’ll never reach the same level of impact by doing something different. “It’s true that it will take time to transition, but if you’ve become an expert in one area you’re likely capable of doing it again <em>and</em> you’ll be able to go deeper faster next time using the skills you bring with you,” says Yung. One rule of thumb for onboarding very experienced hires is that for every year they spent in their last role, they need one month of slow initial onboarding time; once ramped up, their impact accelerates quickly.</p><p data-label="Paragraph"><strong><em>How can I transfer knowledge to the people around me and lay out a strategy for future generations? </em></strong>Think about how you can transfer knowledge to even more people, at a deeper level of complexity and a higher level of efficiency. “If you find yourself explaining something to one person at a time, find a better way to do it. Develop documentation, training programs, or reusable components and infrastructure to pass knowledge on at scale,” says Yung. “Stripe has a strong culture of information sharing and discovery, where anyone can search across shared emails and documents. But, even in such an information-rich environment, engineers who were deeply knowledgeable about a system were often less impactful than those who could also communicate about it in a usable and digestible way.”</p><figure><img src="https://assets.proof.pub/2056/firstround/7aBEVklHR9uvnvSFwXtG_Raylene-Yung_230RT.jpg"></figure><h2 id="advice-for-engineers-moving-along-the-management-track-how-to-better-support-your-team">ADVICE FOR ENGINEERS MOVING ALONG THE MANAGEMENT TRACK: HOW TO BETTER SUPPORT YOUR TEAM</h2><p data-label="Paragraph">First-time engineering <a href="https://books.firstround.com/management/" title="null" target="_blank">managers face a steep learning curve</a>, with added pressure to still set a good technical example for the team. To top it off, you can’t measure your new people responsibilities work in a way that’s as satisfyingly concrete or objective as writing code was. <strong>An easy mistake to make is to try and work around this by clinging on to your coding time, even if it means doing it at night after your “day job” as a manager is done.</strong></p><p data-label="Paragraph">Instead, Yung advises making peace with this shift. “Not feeling productive and overcompensating with technical work can be unbelievably stressful. It can make you wonder if transitioning to management was a mistake. These emotions can last for a while — but <a href="https://firstround.com/review/make-friends-with-the-monster-chewing-on-your-leg-and-other-tips-for-surviving-startups/" title="null" target="_blank">it’s a mistake to act on them</a>. Ride it out for at least six months to a year if you can, and then look back to evaluate how you feel,” she says.</p><p data-label="Paragraph"><em>Instead of worrying about your own contributions, ask these questions as a new engineering manager:</em></p><p data-label="Paragraph"><strong><em>How healthy is my team? How high-quality and high-impact is our work?</em></strong> As a new manager, it’s easy to get derailed by specific challenges or buoyed by big wins. Don’t lose sight of the overall output and health of your team. “Even if you write the best performance reviews, diligently hold your 1:1s every week and go to every new manager training session, if your team isn’t showing results your impact will be lower than it should be,” says Yung. But there’s also the risk of pushing <em>too hard</em> for results and compromising on quality and team health. “You could be working on all the right things and driving up the metrics, but your on-call rotation is on fire and causes engineers to burn out and switch teams. <strong>The key is to invest in all aspects of your team and keep them in balance</strong> — even if some changes may seem counterproductive in the short-term, like slowing down your roadmap to invest in developer efficiency and team happiness, they’ll increase your impact over time.”</p><p data-label="Paragraph"><strong><em>How well can my team operate without me?</em></strong> “An old manager once told me that he could roughly gauge his level of experience by how long he could be away without his team getting too far off course,” says Yung. “At first it was a few days, then maybe a week. Eventually he could stretch it to a month, and then several for paternity leave. Now he aspires to be able to go away for a full year. I suspect most companies won’t let you actually be away that long, but it’s a helpful litmus test to try for yourself. <strong>Growing as a manager is not just about transferring knowledge, it’s also about building the right team and filling in the gaps.</strong> Maybe you have a team of folks who, given the right tasks, can plow through them faster than you expect and ask for more. But if they’re still relying on you to tell them what’s next and break down the next project, you’ll need someone to step in if you try to go on vacation.”</p><h2 id="experienced-managers-dont-default-to-adding-more-engineers">Experienced managers, don’t default to adding more engineers. </h2><p data-label="Paragraph">After gaining experience as a manager, concerns start to shift. You’ve mastered the art of shipping projects, but at some point you might hit diminishing returns. In Yung’s experience, one trap many managers fall into is relying too much on team expansion. “It’s easy to get on the treadmill and only think about growth and headcount,” she says. “But while adding more people might give you the illusion of progress, it could be papering over real issues and making them harder to solve.”</p><p data-label="Pullquote">Adding more headcount isn’t always the cure. It often creates more problems than it solves.</p><p data-label="Paragraph"><em>To move beyond increasing headcount, ask these questions to get more out of your team:</em></p><p data-label="Paragraph"><strong><em>Why does my team exist, and why does what we work on matter? </em></strong>“Talk about your long-term goals and objectives, rather than only the projects on your plate today. Help your team think further ahead, and invite them to suggest different paths to your goals, or debate whether they are the right ones” says Yung. If you can’t explain why your goals and projects matter, maybe you’re working on the wrong things. Solicit feedback and don’t be afraid to change them.”</p><p data-label="Paragraph"><strong><em>How can I help my teammates grow, across all experience levels and scenarios?</em></strong><em> </em>Standout engineering managers can capably manage engineers of different experience levels. The telltale sign of a less experienced manager is when they’re great for new grads, but rarely have the most senior engineers on their team — often due to a mutual unwillingness to manage or be managed by them. Yung’s advice? Instead of trying to work around the problem, tackle it head on. “One of my first team members had been working for twelve more years than I had — I was intimidated, but decided to try and learn from the experience,” she says. “In our first 1:1, I shared areas I thought I could help him with (e.g. product domain knowledge, company context), and asked for his help in others (e.g. managing senior engineers, scaling complex systems). Over the next few years, we developed a strong working relationship and learned a lot from one another.”</p><h2 id="advice-for-leading-organizations-how-to-manage-in-uncharted-territory">ADVICE FOR LEADING ORGANIZATIONS: HOW TO MANAGE IN UNCHARTED TERRITORY</h2><p data-label="Paragraph">“Similar to the initial transition from individual contributor to engineering manager, moving to managing multiple teams or organizations can feel like an entirely new job,” says Yung. “It becomes even easier to fall into the headcount trap, as the need for growth compounds with the number of managers on your team. On top of that, <strong>once you start managing managers it can be tempting to spot new managers everywhere</strong>. And sometimes, you’ll be most tempted to select the reluctant, those incredible technical leaders who don’t really want to manage,” she says.</p><p data-label="Paragraph">Of course, there are “war times” when it’s all hands on deck and battlefield transitions might be necessary. But do it with care, Yung cautions. “Early at Stripe, I transitioned three engineers into management because we needed immediate support and were still spinning up our recruiting pipeline. Two of them grew to really enjoy the role; the third realized they were happiest when coding and providing technical leadership and switched back,” she says. “The key is to work closely to develop new managers — make sure they go into it with eyes wide open and have an opportunity to learn, but also give them the room to switch back. By keeping people in ill-suited management roles, you risk not only burning out some of your most productive team members, but are also preventing yourself from finding someone better.”</p><p data-label="Pullquote">Too many leaders convince the reluctant to become or stay managers, drafting them into duty. This might be necessary in crunchtime, but keeping unwilling managers in roles for too long is a costly mistake.</p><p data-label="Paragraph"><em>Organizational leaders</em> <em>should ask these questions to increase their effectiveness:</em></p><p data-label="Paragraph"><strong><em>What unites your teams and why are you supporting them together?</em></strong><em> </em>In high-growth companies, reorgs are constant and expected. There’s a perennial switch between horizontal, vertical, domain-specific, or user/product-specific matrixed team structures — which means org leads can often end up with a disparate set of groups under their wing. Done wrong, this can feel like whiplash, where new organizations feel arbitrarily grouped together and lack a broader purpose. “At one point at Stripe, I was leading teams that built applications using specific eng and product skills, such as frontend development, ML and understanding the SaaS business model. At first, it did feel almost like a grab bag of apps that were far from Stripe’s core business,” says Yung. “But after work and iteration, we tied the mission to two things: One, enhancing the core payments platform by building powerful features that might not be needed by every user, but were critical to those who did, and two, being the stewards of a new business model that could compound over time and be a meaningful company driver. This helped paint a more coherent vision and enabled people to explain what they were working on, both to themselves and to other teams.”</p><p data-label="Paragraph"><strong><em>Are your teams as healthy as they can be? Are they even the right teams?</em></strong> Don’t be afraid to take action if you can’t confidently answer why your teams fit together or if you’re working on the right things. “Think about bigger cross-team improvements to make. Maybe one team shouldn’t exist at all. Maybe other teams don’t have enough people for their most important projects. Enlist help from your manager, peers and other cross-functional partners to assess your teams and make changes,” says Yung. “I like to assess along the following axes: <strong><em>people</em></strong> (Do I have the right skill sets and leaders on the team? Are teams engaged and are people getting the development and growth opportunities they need?), <strong><em>projects and goals</em></strong> (Are we working on the highest impact things right now? Do people understand what they are and why we are working on them?) and <strong><em>progress</em></strong> (Are we moving at the right pace and investing time in a high-leverage way? What would speed us up the most, both for the short-term and long-term?)”</p><p data-label="Paragraph"><strong><em>Am I spending time with my teams in the right way?</em></strong> “In the same way that knowing the stack and technical work can help you be a good first-line manager, knowing how your managers and their teams operate day-to-day can help you grow as an org leader. Do what you can to support each team and don’t shy away from gathering first-hand knowledge. Attend team meetings as a guest observer, do skip-level 1:1s, and communicate transparently along the way,” says Yung. <strong>But don’t let gathering information take you too deeply into the weeds.</strong> “It’s easy to get caught in that awkward spot where you’re helping debug local team issues in lieu of making changes that help your org overall. You also might feel the impulse to step in and direct the groups that report to you. But now is when the ‘ask don’t tell’ approach is more important than ever. Look to your group leads to tell you what they need. Maximize your value by providing the external context they don’t have and contributing at a broader and higher level.”</p><p data-label="Pullquote">Org leadership is about supporting, listening and coaching, not actively directing. Your teammates at each layer below you know strictly more about their day-to-day challenges than you will, so your meddling is low ROI.</p><h2 id="tying-it-all-together">TYING IT ALL TOGETHER</h2><p data-label="Paragraph">If Yung had to distill all of this advice into a simple checklist for engineers pushing for career growth, here’s what she’d say:</p><p data-label="Paragraph">Strive to be the most valuable, but least critical. Think about how long you could be away from your team and how far off course they would get. Do everything you can to close that gap.</p><p data-label="Paragraph">Focus on growth and learning at every step — not on climbing the ladder as quickly as possible. Don’t move on from a role too quickly, and try not to get caught up in chasing the latest trends.</p><p data-label="Paragraph">The best engineers can toggle back and forth between manager and IC roles. Make sure your technical foundation and fundamental skills are solid enough to pull that off.</p><p data-label="Paragraph">Do your homework before signing on to become a manager, and try your best to prepare for the emotional ups and downs coming your way.</p><p data-label="Paragraph">If you’re a new manager, focus on the health and impact of your team, not on how much code you’re personally shipping.</p><p data-label="Paragraph">Before you request additional headcount, drill down into why your team exists and how you can help every engineer level up.</p><p data-label="Paragraph">Don’t lose the forest for the trees when you’re leading a large org. Dig in enough to understand what’s going on, but focus your contributions on where they’ll matter most.</p><p data-label="Paragraph"><em>Photography by </em><em><a href="http://www.bonnieraemillsphoto.com/" title="null" target="_blank">Bonnie Rae Mills</a></em><em>.

    </div>

    <div>
      <article>
        <p>The Google story begins in 1995 at Stanford University. Larry Page was considering Stanford for grad school and Sergey Brin, a student there, was assigned to show him around. </p>
<p>By some accounts, they disagreed about nearly everything during that first meeting, but by the following year they struck a partnership. Working from their dorm rooms, they built a search engine that used links to determine the importance of individual pages on the World Wide Web. They called this search engine Backrub.</p>
<p>Soon after, Backrub was renamed Google (phew). The name was a play on the mathematical expression for the number 1 followed by 100 zeros and aptly reflected Larry and Sergey's mission “to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.”</p>
<p>Over the next few years, Google caught the attention of not only the academic community, but Silicon Valley investors as well. In August 1998, Sun co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim wrote Larry and Sergey a check for $100,000, and Google Inc. was officially born. With this investment, the newly incorporated team made the upgrade from the dorms to their first office: a garage in suburban Menlo Park, California, owned by Susan Wojcicki (employee #16 and former CEO of YouTube). Clunky desktop computers, a ping pong table, and bright blue carpet set the scene for those early days and late nights. (The tradition of keeping things <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=google+office+locations&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=2560&amp;bih=1253&amp;site=webhp&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CAYQ_AUoAWoVChMIv-ih3J7exwIVx0qICh3-DQ-Q" target="_blank">colorful</a> continues to this day.)</p>
<p>Even in the beginning, things were unconventional: from Google’s initial server (made of Lego) to the <a href="https://www.google.com/doodles/burning-man-festival" target="_blank">first “Doodle”</a> in 1998: a stick figure in the logo announcing to site visitors that the entire staff was playing hooky at the Burning Man Festival. “Don't be evil” captured the spirit of our intentionally unconventional methods. In the years that followed, the company expanded rapidly — hiring engineers, building a sales team, and introducing the first company dog, <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2004/06/yoshkas-weekend-amble.html" target="_blank">Yoshka</a>. Google outgrew the garage and eventually moved to its current headquarters (a.k.a.“The Googleplex”) in Mountain View, California. The spirit of doing things differently made the move. So did Yoshka.</p>
<p>The relentless search for better answers continues to be at the core of everything we do. Today, Google makes hundreds of products used by billions of people across the globe, from YouTube and Android to Gmail and, of course, Google Search. Although we’ve ditched the Lego servers and added just a few more company dogs, our passion for building technology for everyone has stayed with us — from the dorm room, to the garage, and to this very day.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>The collapse of the UK’s social contract is leaving millions of low-income families “surviving not living” and forced to endure unacceptable levels of poverty, according to an independent cross-party report.</p><p>The <a href="https://povertystrategycommission.org.uk/" data-link-name="in body link">Poverty Strategy Commission</a>, which seeks to forge a new national political consensus on reducing poverty, and which includes former ministers from the three main parties, says poverty levels are too high and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/aug/18/uk-poorest-families-fall-in-living-standards" data-link-name="in body link">hardship is becoming more extreme</a>. It warns a “more of the same” approach to poverty in the future will fail.</p><p>It estimates the broad annual cost of significantly reducing poverty in the UK at £36bn – equivalent to £6,000 a year for 6 million families in poverty – a figure reached through a combination of benefits and wage increases, and investment to lower housing and energy costs, and improved health services.</p><p>The interim report of the commission, published on Tuesday, seeks to put poverty reduction back on the party political agenda before the next general election. It is concerned at the lack of urgency from the two main parties over the scale and nature of poverty, and society’s failure to offer adequate protection to its poorest.</p><p>The report says not only have overall relative poverty rates barely budged at between 21% and 24% over the past two decades, but even in areas where some progress was made – such as reducing pensioner and single-parent poverty – they have started to go into reverse.</p><p>It also highlights the rise in the proportion of people in poverty experiencing “deep poverty” – measured as at least 50% below the poverty line. It says nearly a third (31%) of those officially in hardship are in deep poverty and struggling to buy sufficient food, energy and clothes, pay rent and meet other everyday bills.</p><p>While the government often implies there is a “social contract” between state and citizen, the commission says in practice this does not exist, noting that the social security system routinely fails to protect people from poverty even when they are working, are unable to work through disability, or are pensioners.</p><p>Its interim recommendations include a 5% uplift in benefits and wages for people in poverty, outside any inflation increases, although it says poverty cannot be tackled by raising incomes alone, and highlights housing and childcare costs, the additional costs of disability, and energy and travel costs as areas to be addressed.</p><p>The chair of the commission, Lady Philippa Stroud, is a Tory peer and former political adviser to Iain Duncan Smith when he was welfare secretary between 2010 and 2016. She put the commission together to try to forge a new political momentum for tackling poverty, and attempt to engineer broad agreement over how it should be done.</p><p>She said: “Poverty in the UK is too high and the experiences of many people in poverty are now getting worse. Governments of all colours have worked hard to change that picture, but as a society, we have failed to make significant progress.”</p><figure id="cab65f60-5437-4c52-b253-5498a53c9ef9" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:10,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/sep/04/more-children-expected-to-arrive-at-uk-schools-with-dirty-clothes-and-hair&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;More children expected to arrive at UK schools with dirty clothes and hair&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;cab65f60-5437-4c52-b253-5498a53c9ef9&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:0,&quot;design&quot;:0}}"></gu-island></figure><p>The commission, which has been meeting for 18 months, includes the Conservative MP and former work and pensions secretary Stephen Crabb, the former Liberal Democrat MP and coalition minister David Laws, and the Labour MP and former Treasury minister Stephen Timms. Thinktanks from left and right, charities including the Trussell Trust food bank network, and academic experts are also members.</p><div><p>The commission member Miatta Fahnbulleh, the head of the New Economics Foundation, said: “Everyone in 21st-century Britain should be able to afford the basics they need to avoid poverty. It’s shameful that instead millions of families are on the edge of destitution.”</p><p>She added: “In recent years, we’ve made little progress in tackling the causes of poverty: low wages, an inadequate social security system and sky-rocketing housing costs. As the commission shows, the solutions are there to tackle these issues. What we need now is the collective will.”</p></div><p>The final report of the commission is expected to be published at the end of the year.</p><p>Mel Stride, the secretary of state for work and pensions said:<strong> </strong>“We have helped nearly two million people out of absolute poverty after housing costs since 2010, including 400,000 children, and it’s absolutely right we have a joined-up approach to ensure this downward trend continues.</p><p>“Our record financial support - benefits and pensions up by 10.1%, £900 in direct Cost of Living payments to some of the most financially vulnerable, and our boost to the National Living Wage – has cushioned those most in need from the worst of the cost of living pressures and we will continue to support them.</p><p>“I look forward to reading the commission’s full report next year, and continuing with a collaborative approach across government and society to reduce poverty and support the most vulnerable.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="middle-panel"><article aria-labelledby="question-title-Any Day Can Be Prime Day: How Amazon.com Search Uses Chaos Engineering to Handle Over 84K Requests Per Second"><div><h2>Read time: ~<!-- -->21 minutes</h2><h2>Discover how Amazon Search combines technology and culture to empower its builder teams, ensuring platform resilience through Chaos Engineering.</h2><div><a href="https://github.com/setheliot"><div><p><img src="https://github.com/setheliot.png" alt="Seth Eliot"></p></div></a></div></div><div><p><h2>Table of Contents</h2></p></div><div>
<p>This is a story about Chaos Engineering, and how the high scale distributed services that power Search on <a href="http://amazon.com/?sc_channel=el&amp;sc_campaign=resiliencewave&amp;sc_geo=mult&amp;sc_country=mult&amp;sc_outcome=acq&amp;sc_content=how-search-uses-chaos-engineering" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon.com</a> use it to ensure that all customers can search Amazon’s expansive catalog whenever they need to. Chaos Engineering enables teams to experiment with faults or load to better understand how their applications will react, and therefore improve resilience. And this is also a story about DevOps, and how a single team dedicated to resilience was able to create technologies and drive changes that made it easier for the multiple teams that are part of Search to run Chaos experiments on the many services powering Search.</p>
<p>If you are looking to implement Chaos Engineering to improve resilience, looking for how to create an effective model to empower builders, or both, then read on.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1"></h2>
<p>DevOps is a big topic and I cannot cover it all here. I do like the definition that my colleague Jacquie Grindrod wrote in her explanation of <a href="https://community.aws/concepts/what-is-devops?sc_channel=el&amp;sc_campaign=resiliencewave&amp;sc_geo=mult&amp;sc_country=mult&amp;sc_outcome=acq&amp;sc_content=how-search-uses-chaos-engineering" rel="noopener noreferrer">What is DevOps?</a></p>
<blockquote><p>DevOps is an approach to solving problems collaboratively. It values teamwork and communication, fast feedback and iteration, and removing friction or waste through automation.</p></blockquote>
<p>You may have heard about all the tools used in DevOps like Kubernetes, Terraform, and GitLab, but tools are not the right place to start. DevOps is about <em>culture.</em> See Jacquie’s definition above? <em>Collaboration</em>, <em>teamwork</em>, <em>communication</em> — these are all part of culture. The automation tools then enable the culture to get stuff done.</p>
<p>As I said, DevOps is big, so here I will only focus on the primary DevOps concepts that are illustrated in the story of how Search adopted Chaos Engineering:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Empowering teams</strong>: DevOps fosters a culture where teams are empowered to try new ideas and learn from both successes and failures.</li><li><strong>Ownership and responsibility</strong>: In DevOps, teams own the services they build and are responsible for ensuring the right outcomes. Empowerment is a pre-requisite to this, as the team needs to be able to understand how their services are used and be able to implement changes they see fit.</li><li><strong>Breaking down walls:</strong> The impulse behind "DevOps" is to <a href="https://community.aws/posts/devops-wrong-answers-only#walls" rel="noopener noreferrer">break down the traditional barriers that often exist between development and operations teams</a>. By promoting collaboration and shared goals, DevOps aims to eliminate silos and create a more streamlined and efficient workflow.</li><li><strong>Enabling teams to do more</strong>: This is where automation and tools can play a major role. But also organizational structure and responsibilities are crucial here. A team that takes a hand-off from the development team and operates the service <em>for</em> them is not ideal (see “breaking down walls” above). But a specialized team that works <em>with</em> development and reduces the <a href="https://community.aws/posts/devops-wrong-answers-only#undifferentiated-heavy-lifting" rel="noopener noreferrer">undifferentiated heavy lifting</a> of operating the service is better. <em>Undifferentiated heavy lifting</em> is all the hard work (“heavy lifting”) that is necessary to accomplish a task (say, deploy and operate a service) but does vary appreciably from service to service (“undifferentiated”). If every service team has to do this work themselves, then it is wasteful. Having one team to create tools and processes that do much of this heavy lifting removes the burden from the service teams is liberating!</li></ul>

<p>If you have shopped on Amazon.com or any of the Amazon sites worldwide you have probably used Search to find what you were looking for. Searching for a topic like Chaos Engineering returns over 1,000 results (Figure 1), and Amazon Search then lets you refine that search by many different parameters like language, book format, or release date.</p>

Amazon Search returns over 1,000 results for "chaos engineering"</figcaption></figure>
<p>Over 1,000 results is a lot, and Search is responsible for quickly serving results from a catalog of many millions of products to over 300 million active customers. On Prime day 2022, Amazon Search served 84,000 requests per second. That is massive scale. The principles I will share with you here work to enable resilience at that scale, but they also work at whatever scale your systems run too.</p>
<p>Amazon Search consists of over 40 backend services, owned by different teams of builders (also known as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/executive-insights/content/amazon-two-pizza-team?sc_channel=el&amp;sc_campaign=resiliencewave&amp;sc_geo=mult&amp;sc_country=mult&amp;sc_outcome=acq&amp;sc_content=how-search-uses-chaos-engineering" rel="noopener noreferrer">two-pizza teams</a>).  Each team has ownership of their service (or services), from design and implementation, to deployment and operation. So already we can see DevOps practices emerging in our story. When the team owns both development and operations, that is one way to adopt a culture of <strong>ownership and responsibility</strong>, and <strong>breaking down walls</strong> between development and operations. Amazon builder teams are able to own deployment and operation because there is an Amazon-wide builder tools team that creates tooling and processes, removing undifferentiated heavy lifting, and <strong>enabling teams to do more.</strong> A specialized team (Builder Tools) enables two-pizza teams to do more. We will see an echo of this approach later when we talk about how Search adopted Chaos Engineering.</p>

<blockquote><p>Chaos Engineering is the discipline of experimenting on a system in order to build confidence in the system’s capability to withstand turbulent conditions in production. – <a href="https://principlesofchaos.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Principles of Chaos Engineering</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Some folks are put off by the term “chaos”, but it is important to know that Chaos Engineering is <em>not</em> about creating chaos. Instead, it is about protecting your applications from the chaos that is already in production by exposing them to chaos in a controlled manner. You apply the scientific method, creating a hypothesis. The hypothesis is based on how you have designed your application to stay resilient to specific events such as faults or load scenarios. Then you run an experiment by simulating those events, and observing how your application performs, testing the hypothesis. This will show you were your application is doing well against those events, or where you can improve it.</p>

<p><strong>Empowering teams</strong> includes giving them the autonomy to create and run chaos experiments on their services.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1"></h2>
<p>The Search Resilience Team is a two-pizza team within the Search organization, on a mission to improve and drive the resilience of the Amazon Search service. They bring everything I have discussed above together: DevOps + Amazon Search + Chaos Engineering. That said, they would not necessarily describe themselves a DevOps team, preferring to call themselves an operational excellence and site reliability engineering organization. But just like the Amazon builder tools team operates as a specialized team <strong>enabling teams to do more</strong> across all of Amazon, the Search Resilience Team operates as a specialized team <em>within</em> Search <strong>enabling teams to do more</strong> across the 40+ two-pizza teams that own services in the Search org.</p>
<p>Remember that the DevOps model does not have Search Resilience team creating nor owning the chaos experiments for their service teams. Instead they needed to create a scalable process, and the tech behind it, to make it easier for those service teams to create, own, and run chaos experiments, even in production. To do this the Search Resilience team created the Amazon Search Chaos Orchestrator.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1"></h2>
<p>The Search Resilience team had many specific goals in creating this chaos orchestrator, which I will discuss a little later. But the overall goal was to create a system to make it easier for Search two-pizza teams to create and run chaos experiments with the services they own. Figure 2. shows an overview of the orchestrator.</p>

<p>Note I have made an annotation so you cannot miss <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fis/latest/userguide/what-is.html?sc_channel=el&amp;sc_campaign=resiliencewave&amp;sc_geo=mult&amp;sc_country=mult&amp;sc_outcome=acq&amp;sc_content=how-search-uses-chaos-engineering" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Fault Injection Simulator (AWS FIS)</a>. AWS FIS is a managed service that enables you to perform fault injection experiments on your AWS-hosted applications, and therefore is a natural choice when it came to creating and running chaos experiments on the Search services, which are all hosted on AWS using AWS services like Amazon S3, Amazon API Gateway, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon EC2, Amazon ECS, and more. FIS is something anyone running on AWS can use today. The Search Resilience team wanted to make it as easy as possible for Search teams to use FIS, without each of them having to build the same integrations and overhead.</p>
<p>There were Search-specific requirements they wanted to implement, so each team did not have to do it themselves. For example see in Figure 2 where it says “Chaos experiment execution workflow.”  By making the chaos experiment part of a workflow, they can add Search-specific steps before and after the experiment. For example the pre-experiment steps checks if tests have passed in pre-production environments before running them in production, and they also check that no customer-impacting events are in progress before running an experiment. After the experiment, the workflow checks if metrics were adversely impacted (see <a href="#consistent-guardrails-using-slos" rel="noopener noreferrer">Consistent Guardrails Using SLOs</a> below for more details on these metrics).</p>
<p>There were several other Search-specific requirements that are made easier for teams by using the chaos orchestrator. These goals are shown in Figure 3, and I will give you an explanation of each.</p>

<p>Just by removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting, the Search Orchestrator helps to achieve this goal. Also, the Search resilience team wanted to make it easy to use so they created graphical UX front-end. You can see API Gateway in Figure 2 above that presents two APIs. Teams are free to programmatically call these, or they can use the graphical UX that calls these APIs. You can see in Figure 4 it is not the “prettiest” UX ever, but it gives Search teams all the functionality they need to define and run chaos experiments. This is also in line with agile and DevOps where we spend effort only on things that matter.</p>

<p>AWS FIS documents <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fis/latest/userguide/fis-tutorial-recurring-experiment.html?sc_channel=el&amp;sc_campaign=resiliencewave&amp;sc_geo=mult&amp;sc_country=mult&amp;sc_outcome=acq&amp;sc_content=how-search-uses-chaos-engineering" rel="noopener noreferrer">instructions on how to schedule experiments using Amazon EventBridge Scheduler</a>. But remember, we want to eliminate the undifferentiated work. So this is just built in to the orchestrator, and Search teams can use it. Note in Figure 2 that the Search Resilience team went a somewhat different route, using Amazon DynamoDb to store schedules and EventBridge actually invokes a Lambda function to read the schedules and kick of the experiment runs.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1"></h3>
<p>Similar to scheduling, anyone using FIS can run it with their deployment pipelines. For example <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/chaos-testing-with-aws-fault-injection-simulator-and-aws-codepipeline?sc_channel=el&amp;sc_campaign=resiliencewave&amp;sc_geo=mult&amp;sc_country=mult&amp;sc_outcome=acq&amp;sc_content=how-search-uses-chaos-engineering" rel="noopener noreferrer">here is how to integrate it from AWS CodePipeline</a>. But again, to save work for the two-pizza teams, why not just make it work with the teams’ pipelines. Also, Search uses an internal Amazon tool for pipelines and deployment, so the orchestrator takes on the work of integrating with this.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1"></h3>
<p>OK, a lot to unpack here.  First guardrails — these are a MUST for chaos experiments. Guardrails are conditions you define that indicate the experiment will cause unwanted impact, so when these conditions happen, the experiment must be stopped and rolled back. Of course AWS FIS lets your define stop conditions as guardrails — you can see those on the right side of Figure 2. So what added benefit does the Search chaos Orchestrator provide here? That is where SLOs come in.</p>
<p>Service Level Objective, or SLOs, are simply goals that look something like this (this is just a fictional example): In a 28 day trailing window, we will serve 99.9% of requests with a latency of less than 1000 milliseconds. The Search Resilience team did not just build the chaos experiment orchestrator, but they also build an SLO definition tracking system too. This system lets teams define the SLOs for their service, and then it monitors those SLOs, tracking when services are out of compliance. The Search Chaos Orchestrator integrates with this, and uses these SLOs as guardrails for the experiments run by the service teams. In addition to stopping the experiment, the orchestrator notifies service owners and cuts a tracking ticket when a guardrail is breached.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1"></h3>
<p>See that big red button in Figure 4 that says “Halt All Search Chaos Experiments”?  That is the Andon cord. The <a href="https://mag.toyota.co.uk/andon-toyota-production-system/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Andon was created by Toyota manufacturing</a> in their factories where “each and every one is permitted to stop the production line if they spot something they perceive to be a threat to vehicle quality”. Here it allows anyone to stop all the experiments if there is any risk to customer experience. They can use the big red button or a CLI command. You can see in Figure 2 how the Andon functionality is implemented making use of the stop condition functionality built into FIS. In addition to stopping all running experiments, the Andon will cause the Search Resilience engineer who is on-call to be paged. Most two-pizza teams across Amazon have at least one member on-call to handle incidents 24/7, which is part of the DevOps practice of owning service operation.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1"></h2>
<p>Amazon Search, like many Amazon services, makes use of emergency levers as part of their resilience strategy. An <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/rel_mitigate_interaction_failure_emergency_levers.html?sc_channel=el&amp;sc_campaign=resiliencewave&amp;sc_geo=mult&amp;sc_country=mult&amp;sc_outcome=acq&amp;sc_content=how-search-uses-chaos-engineering" rel="noopener noreferrer">emergency lever</a> is a rapid process that allows systems to recover from stress or impact. So naturally Search wants to experiment to understand that the emergency levers work as intended. In this case, a simplified hypothesis might be as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>When the search load exceeds [some value] and errors and latency start to climb (specify which metrics and by how much), then activating the emergency lever to disable non-critical services will keep errors and latency within acceptable limits (define these), up to loads of [specified amount].</p></blockquote>
<p>This particular emergency lever disables all non-critical services, conserving resources when the system is under duress, so that critical services remain available. You can see this in Figure 5. On the left is the normal Search experience. On the right is after the emergency lever has been pulled. Critical functionality such as title, image, and price is shown, but nothing else. Search would rather show the experience on the right, than to fail to return any results at all. This is a resilience best practice called <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/rel_mitigate_interaction_failure_graceful_degradation.html?sc_channel=el&amp;sc_campaign=resiliencewave&amp;sc_geo=mult&amp;sc_country=mult&amp;sc_outcome=acq&amp;sc_content=how-search-uses-chaos-engineering" rel="noopener noreferrer">graceful degradation</a>.</p>

<p>For the chaos experiment, the events include a combination of adding synthetic load to the system and then pulling the emergency lever. This way Search can build confidence that in the case of a real high load event, the lever will enable Search to remain available.</p>

<p>Chaos Engineering is a great way to better understand the resilience of your services. And AWS FIS is a great service for creating and running chaos experiments on AWS. Two-pizza teams in Search could have each independently began using FIS and running experiments. But by adopting a DevOps culture that focused on <strong>enabling teams to do more</strong>, the Search Resilience team was able to make the process even easier for Search two-pizza teams, and add many valuable features that make chaos engineering more effective across all of Search.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As a technologist, hardware has always been my final frontier.</p>
<p>Things you can touch, things that create physical outcomes, these can have so much more power than software alone. But the cost of that power is complexity. Electrons don’t care about our ambitions. Circuits can be harder to debug than code. And even if everything works perfectly on the level of logic and voltage, you’re still managing the complexity of physical objects, their wiring, their position in space, and even their heat dissipation.</p>
<p>Building any product is hard, but building a hardware product is a superset of the basics of any product challenge, adding in the iron constraints of the physical world. It’s not enough to imagine how something looks: you have to also find a way to build it in a way that matches your imagination, while simultaneously accommodating all those physical constraints.</p>
<p>It’s work.</p>
<p>But also? It’s never been <em>easier</em> than it is today. I just built <a href="https://github.com/daniloc/ThermTerm" rel="nofollow">complete replacements for my heat pump controllers</a>. I hated those dinky remotes. You couldn’t read them in the dark at all, and programming them was about as bad as anything you remember from the bad old days of VCRs.</p>
<p>I imagined something that would solve their UI problems, <em>and</em> integrate my heat pumps into my home automation system. I’m not an electronics engineer, but my dreams are now real. I’ve got five of these across the house.</p>

<p><strong>Using open source code is a skill:</strong> knowing how to navigate repos and someone else’s code, understanding how to troubleshoot and navigate communities to get help, discerning between quality projects and junk… this experience is a hard-won component of being a modern software explorer. It can take you further than you might realize, past mere bits and into the land of electrons and atoms.</p>
<h2 id="of-course-microcontrollers">Of course: microcontrollers</h2>
<p>Arduino was a revolution in developer experience.</p>
<p>Beginners could write simple C code and and have a <em>physical computing experience</em> within the space of five minutes.</p>
<p>But since the advent of Arduino, the landscape of microcontroller boards—components that can be programmed to emit and receive complex electronic signals—has exploded.</p>
<p>Boards of every scale and configuration are available today, from the size of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich all the way down to a postage stamp. Microcontrollers are the foundation of the hardware adventure, allowing infinite iteration of custom logic on inexpensive components. Different designs sport different connectors and accessories. There are also different chip architectures out there, and boards built around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP32" rel="nofollow">ESP32</a>, or the new <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/5526" rel="nofollow">Pico W</a>, even include WiFi and Bluetooth capabilities.</p>
<p>Unifying all of this are software ecosystems. Open source Arduino code exists to solve so many kinds of problems, from networking to button handling. Regardless of your board’s architecture, there’s usually a port of the Arduino environment you can use, opening up all that code for your project. If you prefer Python, the <a href="https://micropython.org/" rel="nofollow">MicroPython</a> and <a href="https://circuitpython.org/" rel="nofollow">CircuitPython</a> projects even offer an alternative to C/C++.</p>
<p>But the ecosystem doesn’t stop at software.</p>
<h2 id="stemmaqt-and-qwiic-an-old-standard-with-new-strategy">StemmaQT and Qwiic: an old standard with new strategy</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C" rel="nofollow">I2C</a> is a two wire serial data standard that dates to 1982. In practice, it looks and works a lot like USB: two more wires add power and ground, and you can chain dozens of devices together on a single bus.</p>
<p>For the typical hobbyist hardware tinkerer, the hardest challenge comes down to <em>circuit design</em>. Electronics is arcane, governed by both the laws of physics and decades of component lore. Building circuits means understanding how to use all of these to channel electrons consistently, without letting the magic smoke out. It means understanding how to adjust voltages, manage resistance, <em>and do it all in a way that’s physically sturdy and manageable</em>.</p>
<p>This is a tall order. I’ve never had the time or motivation to learn enough circuit design to build anything more complex than arrays of blinking lights.</p>
<p>But now, I don’t need to.</p>
<p>If you build modern software, you’re well-versed in <em>composition</em>: grab a handful of existing projects—a database here, a UI framework there, an HTTP library to round it all out—and arrange them together. You write your custom logic—the stuff unique to your project—and let other people’s code do work that’s common across all projects.</p>
<p>Thanks to I2C and a convenient cable standard—branded <strong><a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-adafruit-stemma-qt/what-is-stemma-qt" rel="nofollow">StemmaQT</a></strong> by Adafruit, and <strong><a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic" rel="nofollow">Qwiic</a></strong> by Sparkfun, two leading hobbyist component vendors—the same approach to composition is possible in an electronics project. Decide your requirements, and you can probably find a few boards you can quickly wire together—without soldering!—that will address your problem.</p>
<p>In the case of my heat pump controller:</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/5691" rel="nofollow">ESP32-based microcontroller with a built-in screen</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4681" rel="nofollow">Light sensor</a>, so I can automatically dim the bright lights</li>
<li><a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4636" rel="nofollow">Temperature and humidity sensor</a>, so I can have real data about the actual temperature in the room</li>
<li><a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4991" rel="nofollow">Rotary encoder board</a>, to make a dial for setting temperature and toggling power</li></ul>
<p><em>All of that</em> just plugs in via I2C. Each board, like a well-made library, abstracts its gnarly implementation details under the hood. You don’t worry about power management, or the details of how to interpret signals as input from a rotary encoder.</p>
<p><img src="https://redeem-tomorrow.com/images/uploads/264531564-6f04c1c9-9900-47f6-958d-a4b7f66801d4.jpeg" alt="Prototype with various components affixed to cardboard"></p>
<p>Instead, after wiring things together, you look up <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-i2c-qt-rotary-encoder" rel="nofollow">the example code</a> for each component, and adapt it to your project. In the past, actually using these components could be something of a mystery. But now vendors go to great lengths to maintain supporting libraries and docs—developer experience sells!</p>
<p>Adafruit deserves special mention here: they have hundreds of <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/category/1018" rel="nofollow">useful, unique boards</a> that support this compositional approach, and their supporting materials are just exhaustive.</p>
<p>Again, if you know how to apply open source code, you can do this.</p>
<h2 id="from-imagination-to-physical-objects">From imagination to physical objects</h2>
<p>Once you create a working circuit, you can take it all a step further: design and manufacture your own custom enclosures.</p>
<p>It’s really kind of nuts: for $500, you can buy an <a href="https://www.prusa3d.com/category/original-prusa-mini/" rel="nofollow">incredible, reliable 3D printer from Prusa</a>. You can’t beat Prusa: the printers come out of the box working perfectly, they’re vertically integrated with Prusa’s excellent cross-platform <a href="https://www.prusa3d.com/page/prusaslicer_424/" rel="nofollow">slicer software</a>, and the user community is among the most active and helpful of anything on the internet. At that price, its build volume isn’t mammoth, but it doesn’t have to be for electronics projects.</p>
<p>Open hardware vendors often provide 3D models of their products you can bring into a CAD program. With these models, it’s possible to design plastic cases with perfect accuracy, allowing you to mount and arrange the various boards in your project.</p>
<p><img src="https://redeem-tomorrow.com/images/uploads/264529970-ef934ef7-89c7-4ac9-8dc7-f238c8ad32e6.jpeg" alt="CAD model of the device's internals"></p>
<p>Best of all, iteration is fast and cheap. Trying a new version of a design takes only a few cents of material and time to print it. You can figure out quickly if your approach is working. Remember heat dissipation? Waste heat from the microcontroller was biasing my temperature sensor. It only took a couple evenings to find an iteration of the case that solved the problem (I moved both sensors to the top side of the enclosure).</p>
<p>There is a learning curve to 3D printing. It might be the steepest factor here, in fact. Like electronics, 3D printing also has constraints to manage: you have to work with both heat and gravity, and design your models with that collaboration in mind. The physics of how layers are deposited impacts the strength and durability of your output, so the orientation at which you print can have consequences. Choice of materials also matters. I found <a href="https://all3dp.com/2/petg-filament-all-you-need-to-know/" rel="nofollow">PETG</a> to be the ideal material for this kind of work: it’s easy to work with and super durable. By contrast, the more common <a href="https://all3dp.com/2/what-is-pla-plastic-material-properties/" rel="nofollow">PLA</a> was too brittle.</p>
<p>You’ll also want to pick up some CAD skills, but this is less painful and more fun than you might imagine. CAD seems to be the fine art of sketching simple flat shapes, pulling and pushing them into 3D objects, and carving away at small details. I couldn’t stand most of the affordable desktop CAD software—it feels icky, like using a poorly-aged Flash app in IE6. Then I found <a href="https://www.shapr3d.com/" rel="nofollow">Shapr3D</a>, for iPad.</p>
<p>This is some futuristic shit. You tap away with your Apple Pencil, on a tablet computer, drawing things out of your imagination. You nudge your sketches into models, which turn into prints. There’s something far more intuitive about this process than using keyboard and mouse. The positive future shock makes me delirious if I dwell on it.</p>
<p>Community is everything to learning emerging skills. Hobbyists are deeply engaged with 3D printing, and you’ll find help for everything from planning your models to debugging thermal drama with your prints.</p>
<h2 id="i-think-you-should-try-it">I think you should try it</h2>
<p>I’ve been dreaming of building my own electronics since I was a kid. I spent so many afternoons at Radio Shack, and even tried my hand at the occasional kit, with limited success. Every few years in adulthood, I’ve given it another try, observing a steady downward trend in difficulty.</p>
<p>I’m telling you: we’re at a special moment here. The labor savings of open source, the composability, the fun: all of it has come to hardware. You can build things that solve real problems for yourself. I first imagined my heat pump devices over a year ago, and I have been frustrated they didn’t exist every day since.</p>
<p>Now my dreams are real, and the largest energy consumer in the house can be automated and remotely controlled.</p>
<p>That’s amazing.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <p><span>From 16:24-16:43 UTC, multiple GitHub services were down or degraded due to an outage in one of our primary databases. <p>The primary host for a shared datastore for GitHub experienced an underlying file system write error which affected availability for the majority of public-facing GitHub services. SAML login was affected, as was access to Actions, Issues, Pull Requests, Pages, API, Webhooks, Codespaces, and Packages. In this case, our automatic failover was unable to handle the partial file system failure mode. We mitigated by manually performing a forced failover, initiated 17 minutes after our first alert and completed 2 minutes later.</p><p>With the incident mitigated, we are working to assess more detailed impact and resilience improvements to each impacted service while also improving the automated failover mechanism to support this scenario.</p></span>

<p>Today, we’re excited to announce that <strong>Deno KV on Deno Deploy is now in open
beta</strong>. There’s no longer a waitlist so you can get access to Deno KV by simply
signing up for <a href="https://deno.com/deploy" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deno Deploy</a>. For those already using Deno Deploy, your
projects are automatically updated with KV access.</p>

<h2 id="connect-to-kv-from-outside-of-deno-deploy">Connect to KV from outside of Deno Deploy</h2><p>To make it easier to explore, import, migrate, and update your KV data on Deno
Deploy, you can now connect directly to your KV instance from the command line.
Simply set
<a href="https://dash.deno.com/account#access-tokens" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Deno Deploy personal access token</a>
as the local environmental variable <code>DENO_KV_ACCESS_TOKEN</code> and pass your
database URL to <code>Deno.openKv()</code>:</p>

<h2 id="pricing">Pricing</h2><p>We’re excited to announce transparent Deno KV pricing that scales with your
needs. Deno KV is billed along three dimensions: storage, read units, and write
units.</p>
<p>Storage is the amount of data you store in your Deno KV database over a month,
measured in gigabytes. Read and write units are the number of times you read and
write data from your Deno KV database, measured in 4 KiB read units and 1 KiB
write units respectively. If you perform 3 read transactions of 1 KiB each, you
will be billed for 3 read units. If you perform 1 write transaction of 4 KiB,
you will be billed for 4 write units.</p>
<p>Write unit usage is additionally multiplied by the number of regions you have
enabled for your database. If you have the primary region, and two read replicas
enabled, you will be billed for 3 write units for every 1 KiB of writes.</p>
<p>For every user, Deno Deploy’s free tier includes 1 GiB of storage, 15k read
units per day and 10k write units per day. Daily usage resets at UTC 00:00.</p>
<p>For those scaling with Deno KV and Deno Deploy, our Pro tier offers:</p>
<ul>
<li>5 GiB of monthly storage, with $0.75 per additional GiB</li>
<li>45k read units per day, with $1 per additional million reads</li>
<li>30k write units per day, with $2.5 per additional million writes</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is the complete pricing table for more details:</p>

<h2 id="more-read-regions-for-lower-latency">More read regions for lower latency</h2><p>By default, every Deno KV database comes with a single write region and a single
read region. If your users are all over the world, some may experience longer
latencies due to the single read region.</p>
<p>Now, you can enable more read regions to expand your database globally for even
lower latency:</p>
<figure>

<p><img src="https://deno.com/blog/kv-open-beta/selecting-read-regions.png" alt="Screenshot of selecting read regions" title=""></p>
<figcaption>Expand your database globally by enabling multiple read regions with a click.</figcaption>

</figure>

<h2 id="more-powerful-atomic-operations">More powerful atomic operations</h2><p>Atomic operations are a powerful feature of Deno KV that allow you to perform
multiple operations in a single transaction. If any of the operations fail, the
entire transaction is rolled back, ensuring that your data is always consistent.</p>
<p>Previously, you could only perform up to 10 mutation operations in a single
transaction. Many of you told us that this limit was too low, especially when
dealing with complex data that require many secondary indexes.</p>
<p>We’ve heard you! <strong>The limit has been increased to 1000 mutations per atomic
operation</strong>, or a total atomic operation size of 800 KiB, whichever is reached
first.</p>
<h2 id="oauth-made-easy">OAuth made easy</h2><p>User authentication is table stakes for any modern web app. To make it as simple
as possible to implement auth into your Deno Deploy projects, we’ve built
<a href="https://github.com/denoland/deno_kv_oauth" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deno KV OAuth</a>, a high-level OAuth
2.0 wrapper with Deno KV as a backend with a ton of pre-configured common OAuth
2.0 providers, such as GitHub, Google, Facebook, Slack, Discord, and more.</p>
<p>You can add OAuth functionality to your Fresh project using
<a href="https://github.com/denoland/deno_kv_oauth#getting-started-with-fresh" rel="noopener noreferrer">the new plugin</a>:</p>
<div><pre>
<span>import</span> <span><span>{</span> start <span>}</span></span> <span>from</span> <span>"$fresh/server.ts"</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span><span>{</span> createGitHubOAuth2Client <span>}</span></span> <span>from</span> <span>"https://deno.land/x/deno_kv_oauth/mod.ts"</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span><span>{</span> kvOAuthPlugin <span>}</span></span> <span>from</span> <span>"https://deno.land/x/deno_kv_oauth/fresh.ts"</span><span>;</span>

<span>}</span></pre></div><figcaption>This high level wrapper provides many helper functions to make it easy to add auth, login, and more to your app.</figcaption>

</figure>

<p>Projects are already using Deno KV OAuth for authentication, such as
<a href="https://deno.com/saaskit" rel="noopener noreferrer">SaaSKit</a>, <a href="https://hashrock-kv-sketchbook.deno.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer">KV Sketchbook</a>,
and <a href="https://github.com/denoland/deno_kv_oauth#in-the-wild" rel="noopener noreferrer">more</a>.</p>
<h2 id="coming-soon">Coming soon</h2><p>We’ve received your feedback and are working hard to add useful features to make
Deno KV on Deno Deploy the easiest, fastest way to add state to your globally
hosted project.</p>
<p>Here’s an incomplete list of previews of what’s to come.</p>
<h3 id="key-ttl-with-expirein">Key TTL with <code>expireIn</code></h3><p>Key time-to-live expiration is an important feature in Redis, which allows you
to easily manage user sessions or create your own caching system. Soon, you can
do the same in Deno KV with the <code>expireIn</code> option, which accepts a number in
milliseconds:</p>
<div><pre><span>const</span> db <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>Deno</span><span>.</span><span>openKv</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>await</span> db<span>.</span><span>set</span><span>(</span><span>[</span><span>"a"</span><span>]</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> expireIn<span>:</span> <span>1000</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></pre></div><p>The key will be deleted from the database after the specified number of
milliseconds in <code>expireIn</code> have elapsed. If the <code>expireIn</code> is not specified, the
key will not expire.</p>
<p>Note this feature is
<a href="https://deno.land/api@v1.36.4?s=Deno.Kv&amp;unstable=&amp;p=prototype.set" rel="noopener noreferrer">already available in the Deno runtime</a>.</p>
<h3 id="s3-backups">S3 backups</h3><p>Every production application demands data backups in case things go awry. Soon,
you’ll be able to enable backups of your Deno KV data to your own S3 bucket:</p>
<p><img src="https://deno.com/blog/kv-open-beta/enabling-s3-backups.png" alt="Enabling S3 backups for your Deno KV data" title=""></p>
<p>The backup is real-time, supporting point-in-time recovery for your data.
Initially you’ll be able to restore backups to a local Deno KV database, with
support for restoring to a hosted Deno KV database coming soon after.</p>
<h3 id="primary-region-selection">Primary region selection</h3><p>Deno KV uses a single primary region that processes writes and multiple read
regions handling reads. When a <code>write</code> transaction is sent, it’s first processed
at the primary region, then replicated to all read regions, providing eventual
data consistency across all regions. Thusly, your <code>write</code> latencies are impacted
by how far your users are from your primary region, while <code>read</code> latencies when
using when using <code>consistency: "eventual"</code> are impacted by how far your users
are from any of your read regions.</p>
<p>Soon, you’ll be able to optimize latency and performance for your users by
<strong>selecting your primary region</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="https://deno.com/blog/kv-open-beta/selecting-primary-region.png" alt="Selecting your primary region in Deno KV" title=""></p>
<p>Since there’s no one-size-fits-all configuration for every app or business, its
important to have full control over how and where your data is being stored and
retrieved to optimize performance for your users.</p>
<p>A primary region switch takes less than 5 seconds to take effect and causes no
downtime for your application. We’ll be rolling out this feature to Deno Deploy
users in the coming weeks.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2><p>Our vision for Deno Deploy is to make it the easiest place to host JavaScript
through built-in cloud primitives such as <a href="https://deno.com/kv" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deno KV</a> (and more — stay
tuned!). As we work towards a generally available release of Deno KV and Deno
Deploy, we’ll continue to add features to make it as simple as possible to build
and host production-ready JavaScript apps.</p>
<p>We’re always open to feedback and feature requests! Feel free to
<a href="https://discord.gg/deno" rel="noopener noreferrer">join our growing Discord</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/denoland/deploy_feedback/issues" rel="noopener noreferrer">create an issue here</a>.</p>

              <!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>“Howdy Joseph,” the July email I got from Zdravko Krivokapić, who was the Prime Minister of Montenegro until last year, read.</p><p>Obviously, this wasn’t actually Krivokapić emailing me. Instead, it was a hacker who had gained access to what seemed to be Krivokapić’s personal Gmail account. The hackers proceeded to send me a mass of alleged documents from the government of Montenegro, including some related to the country’s Ministry of Finance. Alongside those, the hacker also sent photos of cash, flashy watches, and weapons, which appear to be from the hacker’s own collection and not the former Prime Minister’s.</p><p>Beyond wanting to flex their access to Krivokapić’s account, the hacker said they might use the compromised email to then target other services, using the former Prime Minster’s identity as a cover. It’s unclear how successful that attempt may have been, but the brazenness of emailing a journalist from an official’s email account did highlight something gaining popularity in the digital underground. Hackers are compromising the email accounts of government and law enforcement officials, selling them on the open market, and in some cases using that access to trick social media giants and other legitimate companies to hand over their customers' data. Desired targets include TikTok, Discord, Snapchat, Facebook, and Instagram. The groups where these email accounts are often advertised include criminals who use personal information to target people for harassment, extortion, or physical violence.</p><p>The hacker’s initial email to me ended with “LOL.”</p><div><p>💡</p><p><strong>Do you know anything else about fraudulent use of EDRs? I would love to hear from you. Using a non-work device, you can message me securely on Signal at +44 20 8133 5190. Otherwise, send me an email at joseph@404media.co.</strong></p></div><p>Cybercriminals sell access to these compromised government accounts across a variety of forums and groups chats, especially on the messaging app Telegram. One person who is a reputable seller of personal information on Telegram also claims to be selling such email accounts. One screenshot they shared on Telegram shows an inbox allegedly belonging to a Brazilian municipality; the seller said they are offering accounts for $400 each. In another post and accompanying screenshot, they claimed to have access to an FBI email account.</p><p>A second apparent seller wrote in one popular Telegram group they are “SELLING INDIAN GOV MAILS, $100 A PIECE, CAN ACCESS FB LAW PANEL/EDR IG/FB ACCS.” The post adds they are selling “other third world gov mails” for $50 each.</p><p>Other messages viewed by 404 Media advertise emails belonging to the governments of Thailand, the UK, Germany, Bangladesh, and Nepal.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->  <div>

<!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Many of the adverts explicitly say that buyers can use these email accounts to then make Emergency Data Requests, or EDRs. EDRs are a common mechanism across social media or tech companies designed to provide user data to law enforcement in high stakes situations. This, for example, might include a child kidnapping, where authorities may need data quickly in an attempt to apprehend a suspect or locate a victim.</p><p>One Telegram group where government emails are being explicitly advertised as a way to gain access to sensitive user data <a href="https://www.404media.co/the-secret-weapon-hackers-can-use-to-dox-nearly-anyone-in-america-for-15-tlo-usinfosearch-transunion/">is focused on physical violence against targets</a>. Here, members can hire one another to perform shootings, stabbings, robberies, and more. </p><p>Companies each have their own way for handling EDRs, be that a locked-off web portal or a dedicated department to contact. But they typically require anyone requesting data to contact the company from an official government or law enforcement agency email address.</p><p>That’s why these compromised accounts are so valuable to criminals. They allow hackers to tap into a stream of data that is usually off limits, simply by pretending to be a law enforcement officer. In March last year <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/03/hackers-gaining-power-of-subpoena-via-fake-emergency-data-requests/?ref=404media.co">cybersecurity reporter Brian Krebs reported</a> on the rise of fraudulent EDR requests among cybercriminals and pointed to a specific case involving Discord. A day later, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-30/apple-meta-gave-user-data-to-hackers-who-forged-legal-requests?ref=404media.co#xj4y7vzkg">Bloomberg reported</a> that Apple and Meta had given up user data in response to such demands.</p><p>In more recent Telegram messages, 404 Media has seen criminals specifically discuss the ability to make fraudulent EDRs with TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, and GoDaddy. Others have shown interest in targeting Discord and Snapchat.</p><p>Meta told 404 Media it blocks known compromised accounts from making requests to its dedicated Law Enforcement Response Team (LERT).</p><p>TikTok confirmed to 404 Media it more commonly sees fraudulent requests from people impersonating law enforcement agencies in foreign countries. TikTok said it has successfully blocked some fraudulent requests, but declined to say whether any have managed to get through. TikTok added it has additional safeguards in place to vet EDRs and tools to protect those requests.</p><p>A Discord spokesperson told 404 Media in a statement that “Like any company, we are obligated to comply with law enforcement requests. To ensure the legitimacy of requests from law enforcement, we follow thorough guidelines to carefully evaluate them and ensure they come from a genuine source and that they are not overly broad or vague.”</p><p>Snapchat and GoDaddy did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Krivokapić, the former Prime Minister of Montenegro who a hacker appeared to have targeted, did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p><em>Update: this piece has been updated with a statement from Discord.</em></p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Using Wat2Wasm Directly ( Recommended )</h2>
<p dir="auto">For syntax highlighting and up-to-date builds, you can <strong>optionally</strong> use the official <strong><a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt">WebAssembly Binary Toolkit</a></strong> which will provide you with a <code>wat2wasm</code> CLI tool.</p>
<p dir="auto">If it is found on your path as <code>wat2wasm</code>, it will be used instead of <strong><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/wabt" rel="nofollow">NPM WABT</a></strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>While it is strictly optional, it can help with debugging.</em></p>
<br>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Recommended Editor</h2>
<p dir="auto">We recommend using <strong><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" rel="nofollow">VSCode</a></strong> with the <strong><a href="https://github.com/NateLevin1/wati">WATI</a></strong> extension.</p>
<p dir="auto">This should provide syntax highlighting, intellisense, and other helpful features as you work through the exercises.</p>
<br>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Motivations</h2>
<p dir="auto">I've found just diving in to be the best way to build experience with programming.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings">Rustlings</a></strong> &amp; <strong><a href="https://github.com/ratfactor/ziglings">Ziglings</a></strong> have both had tremendous returns to my journeys with both languages.</p>
<p dir="auto">WebAssembly (and by extension WAT) has a more sparse educational landscape than most and I was hoping to fill some of the gaps by building a project with the same sort of structure.</p>
<br>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Pedagogical Philosophy</h2>
<p dir="auto">Outlined here are some thoughts on what makes a good teaching experience.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Typing Over Reading</h3>
<p dir="auto">The goal is to learn by doing. Comments on each file outline a task and some background. However, a lot about a language can be gleaned by its syntax alone. We should be adding <strong>as little</strong> explanation as possible.</p>
<p dir="auto">Occasional gaps in knowledge can be filled by consistent exposure to the syntax within different contexts. Certain things can therefore be learned without any mention.</p>
<p dir="auto">Introduction text is superfluous. Words add visual noise, so we should be careful with our count. Coding itself should supplement ambiguities in the text.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you find a text confusing or too verbose, <strong>please create a discussion post</strong>!</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Create Struggle</h3>
<p dir="auto">Studies have shown that one cannot learn effectively without effort. This applies to practically every domain of knowledge. These projects should be educational, not easy.</p>
<p dir="auto">This does not mean we should make the education itself elusive. We should not make learning more difficult, but instead more intentional.</p>
<p dir="auto">When introducing a lot of new syntax, keep the problem scope small, but force the user to read a bit. If the syntax is not new, increase the problem scope. Maybe many variations of the same task.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>30. 08. 2023</p><p><strong>Researchers from the <a href="https://www.uochb.cz/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IOCB of the CAS</a>, the <a href="https://www.fzu.cz/en/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Institute of Physics of the CAS</a> and <a href="https://www.upol.cz/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Palacký University Olomouc</a> have made a groundbreaking discovery – using an advanced method of scanning electron microscopy, they’ve managed to image not only the inside of a molecule, but also the structure of the electron shell of the atom. Their experiment was the first in the world to confirm the non-uniform distribution of electron density in aromatic molecules and the existence of the so-called π-hole. </strong><strong>The significance of the results of this research at the submolecular level is comparable to that of the discovery of cosmic black holes. </strong><strong>The study was published in <em><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-40593-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nature Communications</a></em>.</strong></p><div>
			<p>The scientists focused their experiments on aromatic hydrocarbons. Anthracene, benzene, naphthalene, and other aromatic molecules have so-called pi electrons located above and below the carbon skeleton. “However, if we replace the peripheral hydrogens with more electronegative atoms or groups of atoms that pull electrons away, the originally negatively charged clouds turn into positively charged electron holes – π-holes [pi-holes],” explains Pavel Hobza from the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the CAS (IOCB Prague), who contributed significantly to the research in question.</p>
<p>The researcher likens the aromatic molecule to a volcano. When the volcano erupts, a huge crater appears underneath, and we can imagine this as the π-hole. Pavel Hobza explains more in the following video (English subtitles available):</p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="/system/modules/cz.osw.opencms.types/elements/cookies/content_is_blocked.html" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Tgiob7vePk?si=F9Od0r45OJS6myIN" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>The significance of the results of this research at the submolecular level is comparable to that of the discovery of cosmic black holes. In fact, black holes were theorized for decades as well before experiments proved and confirmed their existence. The same research team involved in the discovery of the π-hole had already achieved great success with their previous study, which was published in <em><a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abk1479" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Science</a></em> in 2021, in which they proved the existence of so-called sigma-holes (σ-holes).</p>
<p>“The confirmation of the existence of the π-hole, as well as the σ-hole before it, fully demonstrates the quality of the theoretical predictions of quantum chemistry, which have accounted for both phenomena for decades. It shows that they can be relied upon even in the absence of available experiments,” Hobza explains.</p>

<p><strong>Unique microscopes<br></strong>The above-mentioned discoveries have been made thanks to the unique scanning electron microscopy available at the Czech Advanced Technology and Research Institute (CATRIN). “Thanks to our previous experience with the Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (KPFM) technique, we have been able to refine our measurements and acquire very complete data sets that have helped us to deepen our understanding not only of how the charge is distributed in the molecules but also of what observables are obtained with the technique,” says Bruno de la Torre, head of the research group at CATRIN.</p>
<p>A better knowledge of the distribution of the electron charge will help scientists understand a number of chemical and biological processes. In practice, this will translate into the ability to build new supramolecules and subsequently develop advanced nanomaterials with improved properties.</p>

    <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Hi everyone, I’m FCC Commissioner Nathan Simington, and I’m here to discuss security updates for IoT devices and how you can make a difference by filing comments with the FCC.</p><p>As you know, serious vulnerabilities are common in IoT, and it often takes too long for these to be patched on end-user devices—if the manufacturer even bothers to release an update, and if the device was even designed to receive them. Companies may stop supporting a device well before consumers have stopped using it. The support period is often not communicated at the time of sale. And sometimes the end of support is not even announced, leaving even informed users unsure whether their devices are still safe.</p><p>I’ve advocated for the FCC to require device manufacturers to support their devices with security updates for a reasonable amount of time [1]. I can't bring such a proposal to a vote since I’m not the chairman of the agency. But I was able to convince my colleagues to tentatively support something a little more moderate addressing this problem.</p><p>The FCC recently issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking [2] for a cybersecurity labeling program for connected devices. If they meet certain criteria for the security of their product, manufacturers can put an FCC cybersecurity label on it. I fought hard for one of these criteria to be the disclosure of how long the product will receive security updates. I hope that, besides arming consumers with better information, the commitments on this label (including the support period) will be legally enforceable in contract and tort lawsuits and under other laws. You can see my full statement here [3].</p><p>But it’s too early to declare victory. Many manufacturers oppose making any commitments about security updates, even voluntary ones. These manufacturers are heavily engaged at the FCC and represented by sophisticated regulatory lawyers. The FCC and White House are not likely to take a strong stand if they only hear the device manufacturer's side of the story.</p><p>In short, they need to hear from you. You have experienced insecure protocols, exposed private keys, and other atrocious security. You have seen these problems persist despite ample warning. People ask, ‘why aren’t there rules about these things?’ This is your chance to get on the record and tell us what you think the rules should be. If infosec doesn’t make this an issue, the general public will continue falsely assuming that everything is fine. But if you get on the record and the government fails to act, the evidence of this failure will be all over the Internet forever.</p><p>If you want to influence the process, you have until September 25th, 2023 (midnight ET) to file comments in the rulemaking proceeding.[4] Filing is easy: go to <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/search/docket-detail/23-239" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/search/docket-detail/23-239</a> and click to file either an ‘express’ comment (type into a textbox) or a ‘standard’ comment (upload a PDF). Either way, the FCC is required to consider your arguments. All options are on the table, so don’t hold back, but do make your arguments as clear as possible, so even lawyers can understand them. If you have a qualification (line of work, special degree, years of experience, etc.) that would bolster the credibility of your official comment, be sure to mention that, but the only necessary qualification is being an interested member of the public.</p><p>I’m here to listen and learn. AMA. Feel free to ask any questions about this or related issues, and I’ll answer as many as I can. I just ask that we try to stay on the topic of security. My legal advisor, Marco Peraza, a security-focused software engineer turned cybersecurity lawyer, will be answering questions too.   
I’m open to incorporating your ideas (and even being convinced I’m wrong), and I hope that my colleagues at the FCC are as well. Thank you!</p><p>[1] <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/simington-calls-mandatory-security-updates" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.fcc.gov/document/simington-calls-mandatory-secur...</a></p><p>[2] <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-proposes-cybersecurity-labeling-program-smart-devices" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-proposes-cybersecurity-labe...</a></p><p>[3] <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-proposes-cybersecurity-labeling-program-smart-devices/simington-statement" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-proposes-cybersecurity-labe...</a></p><p>[4] If your comments are purely in response to arguments made in other comments, you have an extra 15 days, until October 10, 2023.</p></div></td></tr>        <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><form action="comment" method="post"></form></td></tr>  </tbody></table>

<p dir="auto">OpenTF is an OSS tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. OpenTF can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.</p>
<p dir="auto">The key features of OpenTF are:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Infrastructure as Code</strong>: Infrastructure is described using a high-level configuration syntax. This allows a blueprint of your datacenter to be versioned and treated as you would any other code. Additionally, infrastructure can be shared and re-used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Execution Plans</strong>: OpenTF has a "planning" step where it generates an execution plan. The execution plan shows what OpenTF will do when you call apply. This lets you avoid any surprises when OpenTF manipulates infrastructure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Resource Graph</strong>: OpenTF builds a graph of all your resources, and parallelizes the creation and modification of any non-dependent resources. Because of this, OpenTF builds infrastructure as efficiently as possible, and operators get insight into dependencies in their infrastructure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Change Automation</strong>: Complex changesets can be applied to your infrastructure with minimal human interaction. With the previously mentioned execution plan and resource graph, you know exactly what OpenTF will change and in what order, avoiding many possible human errors.</p>

<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="npm i @measured/puck --save"><pre><code>npm i @measured/puck --save
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Or generate a puck application using a recipe</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="npx create-puck-app my-app"><pre>npx create-puck-app my-app</pre></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Recipes</h2>
<p dir="auto">Puck is a React component that can be easily integrated into your existing application. We also provide helpful recipes for common use cases:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://github.com/measuredco/puck/tree/main/recipes/next"><strong>next</strong></a>: Next.js app example</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Plugins</h2>
<p dir="auto">Puck can be configured to work with plugins. Plugins can extend the functionality to support novel functionality.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Official plugins</h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://github.com/measuredco/puck/tree/main/packages/plugin-heading-analyzer"><code>heading-analyzer</code></a>: Analyze the heading outline of your page and be warned when you're not respecting WCAG 2 accessiblity standards.</li>
</ul>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Developing a plugin</h3>
<p dir="auto">The plugin API follows a React paradigm. Each plugin passed to the Puck editor can provide three functions:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>renderRoot</code> (<code>Component</code>): Render the root node of the preview content</li>
<li><code>renderRootFields</code> (<code>Component</code>): Render the root fields</li>
<li><code>renderFields</code> (<code>Component</code>): Render the fields for the currently selected component</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Each render function receives the <code>children</code> prop, which you must render, and the <code>data</code> prop, which can be used to read the data model.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Example</h4>
<p dir="auto">Here's a basic plugin that renders a "My plugin" heading in the root field area:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const myPlugin = {
  renderRootFields: (props) => (
    <div>
      {props.children}

      <h2>My plugin</h2>
    </div>
  ),
};"><pre><span>const</span> <span>myPlugin</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>renderRootFields</span>: <span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span>
      <span>{</span><span>props</span><span>.</span><span>children</span><span>}</span>

      <span>&lt;</span><span>h2</span><span>&gt;</span>My plugin<span>&lt;</span><span>/</span><span>h2</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>)</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></pre></div>

<p><strong>TEXAS</strong> - Today, the General Services Administration (GSA) announced the upcoming sale of the Federal Helium System assets, currently managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), as directed by Congress under the Helium Stewardship Act of 2013. In accordance with that law, BLM is required to sunset its management of the system and report any excess helium and helium assets to GSA to follow the statutory disposal process.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The sale process, planned to start July 12, 2023, will include the Cliffside Gas Plant, Federally owned Plant Equipment, Mineral Rights, Helium Storage Reservoir, Natural Gas Wells, and Federal Helium Pipeline. GSA expects the sales process will take between 8 and 9 months, and will engage with industry and stakeholders throughout to ensure an orderly and efficient transfer of assets.</p>

<p>The Cliffside Gas Plant, located at 13301 Brickplant Road, Amarillo, TX, is situated on two leased parcels of land totaling 8.108 acres near Amarillo, Texas. The property encompasses a range of primary and support buildings, including offices, warehouses, maintenance facilities, laboratories, and storage areas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Federal Helium System is also comprised of plant equipment, including a booster compressor, natural gas chiller skid, metering equipment, spare parts, emergency generators, storage tanks, and other machinery critical to the helium enrichment process. Some of the plant equipment is privately owned, with the BLM maintaining operational and minor maintenance responsibilities through a lease agreement.</p>

<div><p>In addition to the facilities, the sale encompasses Mineral Rights acquired by the Federal Government from 1930 to 1942. These subsurface ownership interests cover approximately 38,000 acres of gas and approximately 60 acres of oil resources, providing an opportunity for future exploration and development.</p><p>
&nbsp;
The Helium Storage Reservoir, known as the Bush Dome, is a natural geologic formation located approximately 3,000 feet below the surface. The reservoir has historically held up to 44 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of helium, which includes both federally owned stored helium and native helium commingled with natural gas. At the time of disposal, it is estimated that the storage reservoir will contain approximately 4 plus Bcf of proven and prospective federally owned helium (native and reserve), approximately 2 Bcf of privately owned helium, along with approximately 60 Bcf of federally owned natural gas (<a href="https://www.blm.gov/programs/energy-and-minerals/helium/helium-statistical-reports">according to BLM Helium Operations Statistical Report Issued June 2022</a>).</p><p>
&nbsp;
The Federal Helium System further encompasses a network of 23 natural gas wells some of which serve as high-pressure injection wells. These wells have been instrumental in supplying natural gas to the system, and they offer potential opportunities for ongoing production and utilization.</p><p>
&nbsp;
Crucial to the system's operation is the Federal Helium Pipeline, which spans approximately 423.24 miles, connecting the Cliffside Field to privately owned helium refineries across Northern Texas, the Oklahoma panhandle, and Southern Kansas. The pipeline facilitates the production, transmission, storage, and delivery of crude helium to refineries. The Federal Helium Pipeline works in conjunction with privately owned refineries and BLM and typically delivers more than 2 million cubic feet (MMcf) of crude helium per day to the refiners. It has been a reliable conduit, delivering millions of cubic feet of crude helium daily.</p><p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When Android was <a href="http://www.openhandsetalliance.com/press_110507.html">initially announced</a> in 2007 by the Open Handset Alliance (headed by Google) their flagship project was billed as an "open platform", "providing developers a new level of openness", and giving them "complete access to handset capabilities and tools".</p>
<p>We've come a long way since then, steadily retreating from openness &amp; user control of devices, and shifting towards a far more locked-down vendor-controlled world.</p>
<p>The next step of Android's evolution is Android 14 (API v34, codename Upside-Down Cake) and it takes more steps down that path. In this new release, the restrictions around certificate authority (CA) certificates become significantly tighter, and appear to make it impossible to modify the set of trusted certificates at all, even on fully rooted devices.</p>
<p>If you're an Android developer, tester, reverse engineer, or anybody else interested in directly controlling who your device trusts, this is going to create some new challenges.</p>
<p>Before we get into the finer details, first I want to talk a little about the context around Android CA management and how we got here, but if you want to jump to the latest details you can go straight to the <a href="#enter-android-14">Enter Android 14</a> section below.</p>
<h2 id="open-software-open-device-open-ecosystem"><a href="#open-software-open-device-open-ecosystem" aria-label="open software open device open ecosystem permalink"></a>"Open Software, Open Device, Open Ecosystem"</h2>
<p>While the initial principles of Android were very much focused on open software, controllable by users and developers, over more recent years Android has increasingly limited the control of users, developers &amp; researchers over their own devices.</p>
<p>The key turning point in this process was Android 7 (Nougat, released in 2016) in which the certificate authorities (CAs) on the device that were previously fully modifiable by the owner of the phone were <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2016/07/changes-to-trusted-certificate.html">split in two</a>: one fixed list of CAs provided by the OS vendor and used by default by every app on your phone, and another set of user-modifiable CAs that users could control, but which was used only for apps that specifically opted in (i.e. almost none).</p>
<p>The set of CAs on a device is a small configuration setting with big consequences, as your device's trusted CAs are the organizations guaranteeing the security of your encrypted network traffic. A CA can issue TLS certificates (as used in HTTPS to secure all communication on the web) for any domain name they like, and anybody who trusts that CA will trust those certificates as evidence of a secure &amp; legitimate connection to that domain.</p>
<p>That also means though that if you create your own CA and trust it then you can intercept your own HTTPS or other TLS traffic, to see exactly what your phone is sending &amp; receiving, and potentially modify or block it. Being able to configure your device's CAs is key to this.</p>
<p>That is a lot of power. Making this difficult to modify accidentally for non-technical users and impossible to modify without user knowledge is certainly reasonable. At the same time however, being able to control this is critical for privacy &amp; security research, reverse engineering, app debugging &amp; testing, for assorted enterprise internal network configurations, for anybody who doesn't trust one of the standard CAs provided by their vendor, and many other cases.</p>
<p>With that one change in Android Nougat in 2016, each of those use cases became significantly more challenging. It became impossible for users on normal devices to control who was trusted to secure the communication of apps on their own devices, and a substantial hurdle was created that directly transferred power from users to vendors &amp; third-party app developers.</p>
<h2 id="rooting-around-the-nougat-problem"><a href="#rooting-around-the-nougat-problem" aria-label="rooting around the nougat problem permalink"></a>Rooting around the Nougat problem</h2>
<p>Although this is very inconvenient, fortunately it's long been possible to root Android devices, allowing full administrative access over the device, and making it possible to work around these kinds of restrictions. This isn't officially encouraged by Google, but it's been sufficient as a workaround to allow researchers, developers &amp; reverse engineers to take control of their own devices for these advanced use cases.</p>
<p>By doing so, it was possible to deal with Android Nougat's restrictions on rooted devices, manually adding the trusted certificate to the system store via the filesystem, injecting them into the <code>/system/etc/security/cacerts/</code> directory.</p>
<p>This is a bit harder than it sounds, because <code>/system</code> is generally read-only, even on rooted devices. There are two main ways to solve that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make <code>/system</code> directory writable (requires a little reconfiguration &amp; a device reboot) and then manually modify the real system certificates directory.</li>
<li>Mount a temporary read-write filesystem over the top of the read-only directory, copy the existing CA certs into there, and then add your own additions on top too.</li>
</ul>
<p>In each case there are a few other steps required to ensure that the certificates have the appropriate naming, permissions, and SELinux labels to be accepted by the system (for more low-level details and discussion see <a href="https://httptoolkit.com/blog/intercepting-android-https/">this post</a>), but it's relatively simple and HTTP Toolkit has long automated the temporary mount-based process (see <a href="https://github.com/httptoolkit/httptoolkit-server/blob/aa453e9df98491c549aa4b97b90618f1cf808e17/src/interceptors/android/adb-commands.ts#L256-L308">the certificate injection script here</a>). In practice, this means it's possible to provide one-click automated interception setup for any rooted Android device or emulator.</p>
<p>These approaches have been effective not only on custom rooted devices and specialized Android distributions, but even in most of Google's own official emulator images (everything except the full 'Google Play' edition images, which are locked down to match a normal OEM device) not to mention other emulators from Genymotion to Bluestacks.</p>
<p>Easy &amp; effective CA setup has powered myriad tools that let you see what apps on your phone are sending &amp; receiving: helping developers to debug their networking issues, keeping app developers honest about the data they share, and shining a light on security vulnerabilities in both apps &amp; their APIs.</p>
<p>These techniques are used by HTTP Toolkit's automatic setup, but also referenced in the setup guides for similar tools like <a href="https://docs.mitmproxy.org/stable/howto-install-system-trusted-ca-android/#3-insert-certificate-into-system-certificate-store">mitmproxy</a>, in <a href="https://awakened1712.github.io/hacking/hacking-install-ca-android/">endless</a> <a href="https://binary-manu.github.io/binary-is-better/android/add-certificates-to-android-ca-store">blog</a> <a href="https://blog.ropnop.com/configuring-burp-suite-with-android-nougat#install-burp-ca-as-a-system-level-trusted-ca">posts</a>, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/46569793/68051">StackOverflow answers</a> and <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/tutorial-how-to-install-custom-ssl-certificates-root-etc-on-bluestacks-4-5.4513773/">forum threads</a>, widely used in tools including <a href="https://github.com/NVISOsecurity/MagiskTrustUserCerts">popular Magisk packages</a> and by organizations like the <a href="http://wiki.cacert.org/FAQ/ImportRootCert#CAcert_system_trusted_certificates_.28without_lockscreen.29">community-run CA cacert.org</a>.</p>
<p>These are widespread techniques that have worked for many years. Although the required root access has become more a little challenging more recently (due to first SafetyNet and later 'Play Integrity' using attestation to allow apps to block users who use rooted devices) this solution has generally been quite manageable, and a just-about-acceptable balance between "inconvenient enough to disuade users unaware of the implications" and "accessible to power users who know what they're doing".</p>
<h2 id="enter-android-14"><a href="#enter-android-14" aria-label="enter android 14 permalink"></a>Enter Android 14</h2>
<p>Right now, Android 14 is currently in its final stages of beta testing, slated for imminent release within a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>One of its headline new security features is <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-14-root-certificates-updatable/">remotely updatable CA certificates</a>, which extracts management of CA certificates from the core OS image entirely, and moves it into a separately updateable component, delivered &amp; updated via Google Play. This allows for faster CA updates for Google, allowing them to revoke trust of problematic or failing CAs on all Android 14+ devices with just a Google Play System Update, without waiting for each phone vendor to release an OTA update for the whole operating system.</p>
<p>Although I'm sure you can see what's coming, let me caveat first: at a very high level, the goal here is a Good Thing.</p>
<p>CAs trusted by default like this are in a powerful position, and there needs to be serious oversight &amp; consequences to ensure they stick to their responsibilities and continue to justify that trust. When they fail to do so, it's important that this power is taken away quickly, before it can be abused.</p>
<p>In the most notable recent case, in January 2023 TrustCor was untrusted as a CA by effectively everybody (<a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2023/01/sustaining-digital-certificate-security_13.html">including Google</a>), after close ties to a malware-distributing organization and associated US defence/intelligence contractor were <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/12/02/mozilla_microsoft_trustcor/">discovered</a>.</p>
<p>In the other direction, the inability to widely distribute &amp; trust new CA certificates has caused issues for new CAs on the block such as Let's Encrypt, who have had to <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2023/07/10/cross-sign-expiration.html">repeatedly delay the rollout</a> of improvements to their signing chain, because old Android devices missing recent CA root certificates would not have trusted them, and would thereby have been locked out of significant parts of the web.</p>
<p>Mechanisms to improve the responsiveness of this system are valuable. In addition to just speeding up removals &amp; additions, this should also widen access to those updates, since even devices for which vendors no longer offer official OS updates can continue to receive system component updates like this via Google Play for significantly longer.</p>
<p>Unfortunately though, despite those sensible goals, the reality of the implementation has serious consequences: system CA certificates are no longer loaded from <code>/system</code>, and when using root access to either directly modify or mount over the new location on disk, all changes are ignored by all apps on the device. Uh oh.</p>
<h2 id="the-mechanics"><a href="#the-mechanics" aria-label="the mechanics permalink"></a>The mechanics</h2>
<p>The key change to enable this is <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/8b192b19f264a8829eac2cfaf0b73f6fc188d933">here</a>. Instead of reading from the venerable <code>/system/etc/security/cacerts</code> directory, this new approach reads certificates from <code>/apex/com.android.conscrypt/cacerts</code>, when it exists.</p>
<p>That root <code>/apex</code> path is where Android Pony EXpress (APEX) containers are mounted. These APEX modules are independently updatable system components, delivered as signed &amp; immutable containers. In this case, the certificates form part of Android's <code>com.android.conscrypt</code> module - its core TLS/SSL library delivered as an independently updatable system module.</p>
<p>The exact mechanisms behind APEX are challenging to fully understand, as many low-level details seem undocumented, and <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/apex/+/master/docs/howto.md">what documentation there is</a> includes links to key details only available within Google's internal sites. Tessting the resulting behaviour though, it seems that this is using some kinds of containerization primitives to expose the mounted content directly to individual processes, resulting in surprising behaviour when trying to modify these files elsewhere. As a result, delivering content through an APEX module makes it much harder (seemingly impossible) to manually modify, even with full administrative control.</p>
<p>It's easy to test this for yourself, using the latest Android 14 beta official emulators. Both the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) and 'Play Services' images have always allowed root access (unlike the 'Google Play' images) and by creating an emulator using those you can easily open a root shell.</p>
<p>Follow either of the two existing techniques though, and the expected updates do nothing. Let's walk through a demo.</p>
<p>First, set up your device. You'll need the Android SDK installed, and you probably want <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio">Android Studio</a>, since it makes this much easier, although you can use the CLI directly if you like.</p>
<p>First, create an emulator:</p>
<ul>
<li>Through the Android Studio UI, select any device model, and the API 34 'Google APIs' image for your architecture.</li>
<li>Or, using the Android SDK tools on the CLI, run <code>avdmanager create avd -n TestAVD -k 'system-images;android-34;google_apis;x86_64'</code> (your architecture may vary)</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's try messing with temporary mounts and see what we can do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start your emulator, via the UI or <code>emulator -avd TestAVD</code></li>
<li>Open a root shell via <code>adb shell</code>, then <code>su</code></li>
<li>
<p>Try mounting an empty temporary filesystem over the various <code>cacerts</code> directories now present:</p>
<div data-language="bash">
      <pre><code><span>mount</span> -t tmpfs tmpfs /system/etc/security/cacerts
<span>mount</span> -t tmpfs tmpfs /system/etc/security/cacerts_google
<span>mount</span> -t tmpfs tmpfs /apex/com.android.conscrypt/cacerts
<span>mount</span> -t tmpfs tmpfs /apex/com.android.conscrypt@340818022/cacerts
<span># N.b. that last @id may vary in future updates</span></code></pre>
      </div>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the emulator, open Settings -&gt; Security &amp; Privacy -&gt; More -&gt; Encryption -&gt; Trusted Credentials</p>
<p>Under the 'System' tab, all the certificates you've just hidden from view on disk are there!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, where's this coming from?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We can try searching the entire filesystem to find the source of this data. For example, the top certificate shown is from 'ACCV'. You can also find that in Android's sources <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/ca-certificates/+/refs/heads/main/files/3c9a4d3b.0">here</a>, and it's present both there and in unmodified Android CA cert folders as <code>3c9a4d3b.0</code>. We can search for this with:</p>
<div data-language="bash">
      <pre><code><span>find</span> <span>.</span> -name 3c9a4d3b.0 <span>2</span><span>&amp;&gt;</span>/dev/null</code></pre>
      </div>
</li>
<li>It doesn't exist!</li>
</ul>
<p>But in fact, it does: remove your 4 mounts again (<code>umount &lt;path&gt;</code>), retry that <code>find</code> command, and you'll see that this is indeed present in the original <code>cacerts</code> directories.</p>
<p>Try the exact same steps with an Android 13 image, and you'll find that this modifies the certs just fine, and the Settings certificates list appears entirely empty, as expected:</p>
<p><span>
      <a href="https://httptoolkit.com/static/0d48251c38cb25f809eda5c6e1828673/54003/android-empty-system-certs.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
    <span></span>
  <img alt="An Android device showing an empty 'Trusted Credentials' list" title="An Android device showing an empty 'Trusted Credentials' list" src="https://httptoolkit.com/static/0d48251c38cb25f809eda5c6e1828673/54003/android-empty-system-certs.png" srcset="https://httptoolkit.com/static/0d48251c38cb25f809eda5c6e1828673/0a77b/android-empty-system-certs.png 256w,

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>Let's try another route and see if we can rewrite the system image filesystem directly to modify this list:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Stop your emulator, and restart it from the CLI with a writable system partition:</p>
<div data-language="bash">
      <pre><code>emulator -avd TestAVD -writable-system</code></pre>
      </div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make everything writable:</p>
<div data-language="text">
      <pre><code>adb root
adb remount
adb shell avbctl disable-verification
adb reboot
adb root
adb remount</code></pre>
      </div>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can delete all the normal certificates now (fair warning: this may create problems when using this emulator in future!) with:</p>
<div data-language="bash">
      <pre><code><span>rm</span> -rf /system/etc/security/cacerts/*
<span>rm</span> -rf /system/etc/security/cacerts_google/*</code></pre>
      </div>
</li>
<li>You'll find that you can't delete the certs from <code>/apex</code> though! Despite the remount, it's read-only, and <code>mount -o remount,rw ...</code> commands to do so manually will all fail.</li>
<li>The closest you can do, so far as I can tell, is to unmount the certificates entirely with <code>umount &lt;path&gt;</code> so that they don't appear in the output of <code>mount</code> at all.</li>
<li>Doesn't matter though: no matter how aggressive you get, seemingly no matter how much of the emulator's relevant internals you delete, AFAICT there's nothing you can do to stop these certs all happily loading up in the 'Trusted' list in the Settings.</li>
</ul>
<p>As in with the other method, those same steps will work just fine on every other version of Android, up until now.</p>
<p>Note that this isn't just a detail about the Settings app, where these are cached or stored elsewhere. The certificates as shown here are reloaded each time, and they're representative of every app's view of the certificate store.</p>
<p>No matter what you modify on the filesystem, every app will continue to see Google's list of CA certificates regardless. I've been playing with this for a while, and as far as I can tell there's no working method to modify the certs anybody sees.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-going-on-here"><a href="#what-is-going-on-here" aria-label="what is going on here permalink"></a>What is going on here?</h2>
<p>It's hard to tell precisely, so I'm guessing &amp; inferring here (but if anybody does have more information, I'd love to hear it! Get in touch <a href="https://toot.cafe/@pimterry">on Mastodon</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/pimterry">on Twitter</a> or <a href="https://httptoolkit.com/contact/">directly</a>).</p>
<p>I think the most likely case is that as part of the wider modularization of Android, these system files and components are now exposed to apps through an entirely different mechanism. It looks clear from the Android internals that they're still being <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/8b192b19f264a8829eac2cfaf0b73f6fc188d933/core/java/android/security/net/config/DirectoryCertificateSource.java#64">read from disk</a> and the code to do so hasn't changed in many years, so this implies not everybody is seeing the same filesystem. This is similar to how Docker and friends use chroot, overlay filesystems and mounts to run containers with an isolated view of system files and other devices.</p>
<p>Clearly, this has some serious consequences.</p>
<p>As touched on above: if you're configuring your own system CA certificates on Android right now for debugging, reverse engineering, testing or research, that option is going away in Android 14, and presumably all future versions too.</p>
<p>For now anybody interested in these use cases will just have to avoid updating, or use custom OS releases that don't use the APEX module to manage their CA certs. As time goes by though, this will likely become increasingly impractical, since it means either diverging strongly from Android mainline on a key internal component or running outdated software indefinitely.</p>
<p>Concerningly though, this also implies that APEX system modules are going to be a wider problem. If, as it appears, content within APEX modules is unmodifiable to users even with root access to the device, then every future system component that's moved into the remit of APEX is another part of Android that becomes completely removed from user control.</p>
<p>More investigation is required and it's hard to know the full implications of that now, but for the many forks of Android like GrapheneOS &amp; LineageOS, and for advanced device configuration tools like <a href="https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk#readme">Magisk</a> and its many modules, it probably spells trouble.</p>
<p>Personally, for now I'm investigating some other promising alternative solutions to allow interception of your own network traffic on Android, and I'll share details here as soon as I have something working, so watch this space.</p>
<p>In the meantime, if you want to debug your own HTTPS traffic, you'll need to stick to Android 13.</p>

<p>When a customer asked Pedro Júnior to bring the food he was delivering up to their apartment, he’d weigh his options: Take his bulky (and often heavy) bag up with him, or leave it behind and risk it being stolen? Júnior, who works for a food delivery app, has had his bag stolen twice already on the streets of Rio de Janeiro. One night, he told <em>Rest of World</em>, someone tried to steal his motorbike. “I came back to see someone had tampered with the chain with which I lock up my baby,” he said, using the pet name he has for his bike. That was the last straw. From then on, Júnior pledged that customers would either come down to get their food — or they’d go without it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Customers pushed back, often reacting rudely when Júnior told them they’d need to come down to collect their order. So he turned to TikTok, and a trend was born: Júnior posts videos of himself arguing with customers over the intercom, while eating the unretrieved meals and singing a song he’s made up. “Se não descer, eu como mesmo,” it goes. (“If you don’t come down, I’ll eat it”). In one video, Júnior dances to the song with a group of other delivery drivers.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@lgdastart/video/7220429469759098117">song’s debut went viral</a>, with 7.6 million views on TikTok and thousands of expressions of solidarity from customers and also workers who faced the same issue. Soon, other delivery drivers followed Júnior’s lead and began creating their own videos.</p>



<p>The social media trend showed how customers’ insistence on doorstep delivery is a common problem for Brazil’s almost 386,000 delivery app workers. It has since escalated into motorbike protests, with drivers honking and loudly revving up their bikes in front of apartment buildings. They have also taken their demands to local lawmakers. In two state capitals, Fortaleza and Porto Velho, delivery drivers have won the right to refuse requests to deliver inside apartment buildings.</p>



<p>According to Rappi and iFood, which control over 90% of Brazil’s app delivery market, drivers do not need to make doorstep deliveries. On paper, representatives from both companies told <em>Rest of World</em>, their rules already require delivery workers to only go as far as a street-level point of contact, from which customers are asked to collect their meals.</p>



<p>A common worry among drivers is that their cycles, motorbikes, or bags might be stolen if left unattended. Most buildings don’t allow them to park inside, workers told <em>Rest of World</em>, forcing them to leave their vehicles and delivery bags on the street. The bags frequently contain two or three orders as the apps assign them multiple deliveries along the same route. To avoid having the other orders stolen, the bags must also go up with the drivers.</p>

<p>But drivers also want to save time, as the process of getting through Brazil’s heavily guarded buildings can be time-consuming. It often involves checking in with a concierge and handing over an ID. Sometimes, biometric photo-registration may be required. The minutes spent delivering an order to the customer’s doorstep is time they could be using to complete other potential orders. “The more orders we deliver, the more money we make,” Júnior said.</p>



<p>When a customer refuses to come down, many now follow Júnior’s lead. They refuse, in turn, to deliver the order.&nbsp;Júnior said he tries to return undelivered meals when possible, but some restaurants, like McDonald’s — a frequent order in his videos — don’t accept returns and advise him to throw the food away. “When they tell me to toss [a meal], my understanding is that I’m free to do whatever I want with it,” he said. “I’m not going to throw it out, so either I give it to a homeless person, eat it myself, or take it home to my son.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Beyond TikTok, delivery workers also vent to colleagues in Telegram groups. Videos on gig worker chat groups and on social media often show drivers being verbally assaulted by customers for refusing to carry an order upstairs. Recently, a popular delivery driver-turned-YouTuber made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23bYAUEZpLI">video</a> reacting to the humiliation of fellow drivers by customers. In one scene, a customer walks away with the food and ignores the driver’s plea for the delivery code — which confirms to the app that an order has been completed — hampering his ability to take other orders.</p>



<p>Arguments with customers have often escalated and <a href="https://www.sbtnews.com.br/noticia/primeiro-impacto/233910-descontrolada-cliente-agride-entregador-em-predio-no-df">led to violence</a>. In December 2022, <a href="https://g1.globo.com/df/distrito-federal/noticia/2022/12/12/entregadores-fazem-mais-um-protesto-no-df-apos-nova-briga-entre-motoboy-e-cliente-veja-video.ghtml">media reports </a>highlighted altercations between app users and delivery workers across Brasília — a few of which <a href="https://www.sbtnews.com.br/noticia/primeiro-impacto/233910-descontrolada-cliente-agride-entregador-em-predio-no-df">got physical</a>.</p>



<p>Given how often customers react aggressively, many drivers end up agreeing to take orders upstairs. “If we don’t, we risk getting a bad review from the client or even having our accounts reported,” Wellington Lopes, a delivery worker in Rio de Janeiro, told <em>Rest of World.</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>As episodes of violence piled up in Brasília and surrounding cities, the Federal District Association for App Workers and Motorcyclists (ATAM-DF), an app workers’ organization, took legal action. They reached out to Fábio Félix, a local legislator from Brasília, who has been following app workers’ demands since 2019.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“IFood thinks we [falsely report food as undelivered] on purpose to eat the meals, but no, it really is tough being a delivery driver.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Abel Santos, vice president of the association, told <em>Rest of World</em> the workers created a draft bill and sent it over to Felix’s legal team for consideration. The draft, which establishes that workers should not be obligated to deliver within apartment buildings, is now being discussed in Brasília’s local legislature. Like Fortaleza’s existing doorstep delivery law, the Brasília draft provides exemptions for customers with reduced mobility or special needs.</p>



<p>According to Danilo Lopes, a councilman from Fortaleza, the widespread support for his city’s doorstep delivery law can also be attributed to its benefits for customers. “On the side of residents, there’s a fear of insecurity, as thieves have been passing themselves off as delivery drivers to gain access to apartments and commit robberies,” he told <em>Rest of World</em>.</p>



<p>Projects aiming to grant workers the right to refuse doorstep delivery have so far been approved in three Brazilian cities: Valadares, Porto Velho, and Fortaleza. At least two others — Brasília and Manaus — are currently considering implementing similar legislation, with Rio de Janeiro considering a statewide law.</p>



<p>In Brasília, workers haven’t been waiting idly by as lawmakers discuss their petitions. They’ve been organizing on messaging apps, and protesting in front of the buildings where violence between workers and customers has taken place, across the city’s many upper-class neighborhoods. The local delivery workers’ association has not publicly endorsed the protests because its members are already involved with the draft bill and in legal proceedings helping some workers.</p>



<p>Júnior claimed his iFood account was blocked without explanation after he began posting videos; he doesn’t dismiss the possibility of a connection between the two. He’s now looking to get back into deliveries. “I’ll keep making videos,” he said, but added that he’d stop recording himself eating orders to minimize the risk of being blocked again. “IFood thinks we [falsely report food as undelivered] on purpose to eat the meals, but no,” said Júnior. “It really is tough being a delivery driver.”</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/deadbeefsociety/sshfs">https://github.com/deadbeefsociety/sshfs</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37390184">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-target="readme-toc.content">
            <article itemprop="text"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">This is a currently maintained fork of SSHFS</h2>
<p dir="auto">SSHFS (original repo: <a href="https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs">https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs</a>) has been declared to be unmaintained and it breaks our heart. So me and some friends have decided to fork it and give it some love.</p>
<p dir="auto">There's a rust fork in progress by Greg Shuflin (<a href="https://github.com/neunenak/sshfs/tree/rust">https://github.com/neunenak/sshfs/tree/rust</a>). Rust is a modern and memory safe programming language, and in the long term, it's not a bad decision to port it to rust.</p>
<p dir="auto">However, there are some downsides to Rust, such as it being still a young language, unstable API changes, it not having a standard specification yet, and long and compute-intensive compilation process etc.</p>
<p dir="auto">So from a maintenance perspective, we are just here to fix issues, merge PRs, and give this project some love until the rust fork is ready (maybe even backport changes/features from there for a period of time).</p>
<p dir="auto">Everyone is welcome to create issues or PRs, please do contribute!</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">SSHFS</h2>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">About</h2>
<p dir="auto">SSHFS allows you to mount a remote filesystem using SFTP. Most SSH
servers support and enable this SFTP access by default, so SSHFS is
very simple to use - there's nothing to do on the server-side.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Development Status</h2>
<p dir="auto">SSHFS is shipped by all major Linux distributions and has been in
production use across a wide range of systems for many years. However,
at present SSHFS does not have any active, regular contributors, and
there are a number of known issues (see the <a href="https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs/issues">bugtracker</a>).  The current
maintainer continues to apply pull requests and makes regular
releases, but unfortunately has no capacity to do any development
beyond addressing high-impact issues. When reporting bugs, please
understand that unless you are including a pull request or are
reporting a critical issue, you will probably not get a response.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How to use</h2>
<p dir="auto">Once sshfs is installed (see next section) running it is very simple:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="sshfs [user@]hostname:[directory] mountpoint"><pre><code>sshfs [user@]hostname:[directory] mountpoint
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">It is recommended to run SSHFS as regular user (not as root).  For
this to work the mountpoint must be owned by the user.  If username is
omitted SSHFS will use the local username. If the directory is
omitted, SSHFS will mount the (remote) home directory.  If you need to
enter a password sshfs will ask for it (actually it just runs ssh
which asks for the password if needed).</p>
<p dir="auto">Also many ssh options can be specified (see the manual pages for
<em>sftp(1)</em> and <em>ssh_config(5)</em>), including the remote port number
(<code>-oport=PORT</code>)</p>
<p dir="auto">To unmount the filesystem:</p>

<p dir="auto">On BSD and macOS, to unmount the filesystem:</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation</h2>
<p dir="auto">First, download the latest SSHFS release from
<a href="https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs/releases">https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs/releases</a>. You also need <a href="http://github.com/libfuse/libfuse">libfuse</a> 3.1.0 or newer (or a
similar library that provides a libfuse3 compatible interface for your operating
system). Finally, you need the <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/" rel="nofollow">Glib</a> library with development headers (which should be
available from your operating system's package manager).</p>
<p dir="auto">To build and install, we recommend to use <a href="http://mesonbuild.com/" rel="nofollow">Meson</a> (version 0.38 or
newer) and <a href="https://ninja-build.org/" rel="nofollow">Ninja</a>.  After extracting the sshfs tarball, create a
(temporary) build directory and run Meson:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ mkdir build; cd build
$ meson .."><pre><code>$ mkdir build; cd build
$ meson ..
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Normally, the default build options will work fine. If you
nevertheless want to adjust them, you can do so with the <em>mesonconf</em>
command:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ mesonconf                  # list options
$ mesonconf -D strip=true    # set an option"><pre><code>$ mesonconf                  # list options
$ mesonconf -D strip=true    # set an option
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">To build, test and install SSHFS, you then use Ninja (running the
tests requires the <a href="http://www.pytest.org/" rel="nofollow">py.test</a> Python module):</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ ninja
$ python3 -m pytest test/    # optional, but recommended
$ sudo ninja install"><pre><code>$ ninja
$ python3 -m pytest test/    # optional, but recommended
$ sudo ninja install
</code></pre></div>

mailing list (subscribe at
<a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/fuse-sshfs" rel="nofollow">https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/fuse-sshfs</a>).</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p><span><span>F</span></span>ather’s Day is dangerous for Robert Nurden. Childless not through choice but, as he puts it, “complacency, bad luck, bad judgment”, he tries to stay indoors and ignore the family celebrations outside.</p><p>But one year, he went for a walk. “I met family after family. There were children everywhere,” he remembered. “It was terrible. Just so painful. So many ambushes and triggers for my anguish.”</p><p>There is very little research into men who have not had children, although that is beginning to change. Research by <a href="https://www.robinhadley.co.uk/" data-link-name="in body link">Dr Robin Hadley</a> has found that 25% of men over 42 do not have children – 5% more than women of the same age group.</p><p>Half of the men who are not fathers but wanted to be describe a huge grief and isolation from society. Almost 40% have experienced depression and a quarter feel a deep anger.</p><p>Now 72, Nurden had a sheltered upbringing. Reaching adulthood, there was a lot he wanted to experience. “Having children was a very low priority. I was complacent: I just assumed it would happen,” he said.</p><p>It was not until he was in his early 40s that Nurden started to get broody. But by that point, he discovered, women of a similar age had already had children, if they were able or wanted to.</p><p>“I went into this 15-year period of not going into relationships or ending relationships quickly because I knew that person wasn’t going to want or be able to have a child with me – or that the relationship wasn’t going to be strong enough to last if we did have a child,” said Nurden.</p><p>He said high-profile older fathers breed complacency in ordinary men. “If I’m honest, even when I was in my 50s I believed that it might happen for me. But in real life, the Mick Jagger and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/mar/18/jon-snow-channel-4-late-fatherhood" data-link-name="in body link">Jon Snow-age fathers</a> are actually very rare – and in any case, it’s medically not wise, as regards sperm quality.”</p><p>What compounded Nurden’s pain was that there was no public or private discussion about how men feel when circumstance leaves them unable to become fathers.</p><p>“There’s lots of publicity, quite rightly, about women and childlessness but men are very mute about this. Married men don’t want to hear it either: I’ve had men with children react with anger, as though they feel threatened, when I’ve tried to talk about my pain,” he said.</p><p>“I was mute too until recently, because as I aged, I found the regret grew into a great pain,” he added. “Unlike many other forms of grief, this compounds itself as it gets older: I wasn’t a father but now I’m not a grandfather. When I’m even older, I might find myself entirely alone.”</p><p>Nurden has published a book, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/195698230-i-always-wanted-to-be-a-dad" data-link-name="in body link">I Always Wanted to be a Dad: Men Without Children</a>, about his story and that of some other men. “It turns out that there is a lot of pain, regret and sadness out there,” he said.</p><p>Hadley, the researcher, is childless because although his wife had wanted children, by the time she and Hadley met, her age meant the risk of having one was too great. “I chose love but that doesn’t make the pain of not having children any less,” he said. “When a close colleague had his first child, I was so jealous that I couldn’t be in the same room as him.”</p><p>Being a father is a marker of status in many countries, said Hadley, but not in the west. “While there has recently been a lot more public discussion about how to be a good father, we still don’t have any narrative or celebration about how important it is for men to become a father in the first place,” he said.</p><p>Paul Goulden, the chair of <a href="https://www.awwoc.org/" data-link-name="in body link">Ageing Without Children,</a> said that, along with the lack of public dialogue about becoming a father, he was “not convinced that there’s this Game of Thrones genetic push felt by men to have children”.</p><p>Instead, he said: “There’s this mistaken belief that men are fertile across their lifespan, so there’s no imperative to get on with it.”</p><p>That complacency persists because men without children historically have not spoken about their grief. But, Goulden said: “I hope Robert’s book will trigger a change in public dialogue around this issue. I think there’s an overwhelming sense of loneliness and fear out there about who is going to be there for these men, when they’re old and all alone.”</p></div></div>]]></description>
