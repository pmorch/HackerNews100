<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
							
<p>Well, well, well... It looks like <a href="https://stackdiary.com/brave-selling-copyrighted-data-for-ai-training/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brave</a> isn't the only company out there that is willing to bet all its chips on reusing other people's content for AI training. </p>



<p>Zoom Video Communications, Inc. <a href="https://explore.zoom.us/en/terms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently updated its Terms of Service</a> to encompass what some critics are calling a significant invasion of user privacy.</p>



<p>In a detailed perusal of the newly updated terms, two sections - <strong>10.2</strong> and <strong>10.4</strong> - stand out for their broad-ranging implications on how Zoom is permitted to utilize user data. These sections establish Zoom's rights to compile and utilize "Service Generated Data," which is any telemetry data, product usage data, diagnostic data, and similar content or data that Zoom collects in connection with users' use of their services or software.</p>



<p>Zoom's updated policy states that all rights to Service Generated Data are retained solely by Zoom. This extends to Zoom's rights to modify, distribute, process, share, maintain, and store such data "for any purpose, to the extent and in the manner permitted under applicable law."</p>



<p>What raises alarm is the explicit mention of the company's right to use this data for machine learning and artificial intelligence, including training and tuning of algorithms and models. This effectively allows Zoom to train its AI on customer content without providing an opt-out option, a decision that is likely to spark significant debate about user privacy and consent.</p>



<p>Additionally, under section 10.4 of the updated terms, Zoom has secured a "perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license" to redistribute, publish, access, use, store, transmit, review, disclose, preserve, extract, modify, reproduce, share, use, display, copy, distribute, translate, transcribe, create derivative works, and process Customer Content.</p>



<p>Zoom justifies these actions as necessary for providing services to customers, supporting the services, and improving its services, software, or other products. However, the implications of such terms are far-reaching, particularly as they appear to permit Zoom to use customer data for any purpose relating to the uses or acts described in section 10.3.</p>



<p>Privacy advocates and legal experts are expected to scrutinize these updated terms closely. Many argue that they push the boundaries of what is acceptable in terms of consent, data privacy, and individual rights. While Zoom's intentions may be focused on improving their platform and delivering better service, the breadth and depth of these changes may leave many users uncomfortable and seeking assurances about how their data is being used.</p>



<p>Zoom has yet to comment (added below) on the updates and potential concerns raised by these changes. As this unfolds, the debate around privacy in the digital age and the responsibility of companies in respecting user privacy continues to intensify.</p>



<p><em><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37021160" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Discuss on Hacker News</a></em></p>

<h3>An update</h3>



<p>Biella Coleman picked this story up and <a href="https://twitter.com/BiellaColeman/status/1688332659108257792" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted it out</a>, which got this trending and invoked a response from Zoom. </p>



<p>Aparna Bawa, COO at Zoom, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37029700" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">left a comment on Hacker News</a>,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>To clarify, Zoom customers decide whether to enable generative AI features (recently launched on a free trial basis) and separately whether to share customer content with Zoom for product improvement purposes.</p>



<p>Also, Zoom participants receive an in-meeting notice or a Chat Compose pop-up when these features are enabled through our UI, and they will definitely know their data may be used for product improvement purposes.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I myself also got an email from a spokesperson, who said that, <em>"Zoom customers decide whether to enable generative AI features, and separately whether to share customer content with Zoom for product improvement purposes."</em>.</p>



<p>While these are all lovely responses, and at least they're being involved in the discussion, they don't actually answer the <strong>10.4</strong> clause in the Terms of Service, which states,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>You agree to grant and hereby grant Zoom a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license and all other rights required or necessary to redistribute, publish, import, access, use, store, transmit, review, disclose, preserve, extract, modify, reproduce, share, use, display, copy, distribute, translate, transcribe, create derivative works, and process Customer Content and to perform all acts with respect to the Customer Content, including AI and ML training and testing.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Unless these are rectified and clarified, this means that Zoom can do exactly what they say they can do because you are agreeing to grant all the abovementioned permissions. I cannot stress enough that these aren't just "words at a wall" - in the <strong>10.2</strong> clause, you literally consent to Zoom using your data for AI/ML; you do not have a choice to opt-out because opting-out is not part of the terms.</p>



<p>Zoom has published a blog post on the matter; <a href="https://twitter.com/Zoom/status/1688550493717417985" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you can see the tweet here</a>. </p>



<p>I'm linking to the tweet (and you can also read <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37034980" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this Hacker News comment</a>) because there should be discourse (unfortunately, for Zoom, it's not in their favor) around this rather than blank statements.</p>

<p>David Zipper, who researches and writes about mobility and transportation, recently <a href="https://mastodon.social/@davidzipper/110843841107933007">did a big thread on Mastodon</a> (and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/davidzipper.bsky.social/post/3k4a4elm25e2p">Bluesky</a>) about car bloat: the way in which cars and trucks have gotten much bigger and heavier in the US over the past few decades and how it's bad for society. The whole thread is worth a read...here are a couple of Zipper's points:</p>

<blockquote><p>Tall vehicles have bigger blind spots and are more likely to strike a person's torso or head. Heavier vehicles exert more force crashing into a person, bicycle, or smaller car. They also have longer braking distances.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Heavier cars exert more pressure on tires, eroding them faster. Tire particles are absorbed into water, where they damage ecosystems. They also float through the air, harming human health when ingested.</p></blockquote>

<p>For further reading, Zipper links to a number of pieces he's written in recent months: <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90854942/the-blatant-greenwashing-of-suvs">The Blatant Greenwashing of SUVs</a>, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/07/electric-vehicles-tires-wearing-out-particulates/674750/">EVs Are Sending Toxic Tire Particles Into the Water, Soil, and Air</a>, <a href="https://slate.com/business/2023/06/electric-vehicles-auto-haulers-weight-capacity-roads.html">Carry That Weight</a>, and <a href="https://slate.com/business/2022/11/suv-size-truck-bloat-pedestrian-deaths.html">The Car Safety Feature That Kills the Other Guy</a>. Zipper's solution to these problems is government action: for example, <a href="https://slate.com/business/2023/01/electric-cars-hummer-ev-tax-fees-weight-joe-biden.html">taxing vehicles by weight</a>, testing vehicles for pedestrian and cyclist safety, or requiring drivers have commercial driver's licenses for larger vehicles.</p>

The Linux kernel, on the other hand, began development in 1993 and was initially considered a “kludge” until the Hurd was completed. It is now matured and widely used.</p><p id="7e47">Like the Loch Ness Monster, many believe that GNU/Hurd is vaporware and does not exist. It <strong>does</strong> exist and continues to evolve, albeit at a slow pace. Just recently, the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/news/2023-06-11-debian_gnu_hurd_2023.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Debian GNU/Hurd 2023</a> has been released. You can use the GNU/Hurd right now.</p><h2 id="39db">GNU/Hurd? GNU Hurd? or Debian GNU/Hurd?</h2><p id="9e3e">There has been a well-known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU/Linux_naming_controversy" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">ideological controversy</a> over the names GNU and Linux. Anywise, it would be helpful to sort out the word.</p><p id="0bce">GNU is the name of a Unix-compatible operating system (an acronym of “GNU is Not Unix”), and the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">GNU Project</a> is a project to create GNU. Hence, a flavor of GNU that adopted Linux as its kernel is GNU/Linux. There was also GNU/kFreeBSD, which adopted the FreeBSD kernel, although it has recently been <a href="https://blog.aurel32.net/goodbye-kfreebsd.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">discontinued</a>.</p><p id="d754">To simplify it further,</p><ul><li id="e957">Linux = kernel (the core of the operating system).</li><li id="2df7">GNU = so-called user land (the part of the operating system that is not the kernel and that deals with users, such as the GNU Core Utilities, the GNU tool chain such as GCC, etc.).</li></ul><p id="af1f">Unlike the Linux kernel, the Hurd is not a “kernel.” In a way,</p><ul><li id="798a">“Hurd” = GNU Mach (microkernel) + GNU Hurd (system servers) + <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/microkernel/mach/mig/gnu_mig.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">GNU MIG</a> (Mach Interface Generator)</li></ul><p id="a9b7">are roughly equivalent to a “kernel.” The GNU Hurd is a herd of servers that implements many functions, including user authentication, binary execution, the file system, networking, and even /dev/null as a server separate from the kernel. There are currently <a href="https://www.debian.org/ports/hurd/hurd-doc-server" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">24 servers</a> consisting of the Hurd.</p><figure><figcaption>Linux corresponds to the left, Hurd to the middle, from Wikipedia.</figcaption></figure><p id="1714">So, although slightly imprecise, GNU Hurd (without the slash) is the name of the group of user-mode servers, and GNU/Hurd is the name of the Unix-compatible operating system that uses the “Hurd” as its “kernel.” Therefore, a kind of GNU that adopted the Hurd is an operating system called GNU/Hurd.</p><p id="cfbe">There are already several distributions based on GNU/Hurd. The best known is <a href="https://www.debian.org/ports/hurd/index.en.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Debian GNU/Hurd</a>. I am using this one because I am a Debian developer and familiar with Debian. The <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/en/download/latest/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">GNU Guix system on the GNU Hurd</a> is another interesting one.</p><h2 id="6f7d">Running Debian GNU/Hurd in the cloud</h2><p id="e39d">The GNU Hurd’s hardware support is poor, so trying to run it on modern physical machines is suicide. In the cloud, however, “virtual” devices are standardized. There is no need to support various devices as in the real world.</p><p id="43d4">However, <a href="https://wiki.libvirt.org/Virtio.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">virtio</a> still needs to be supported by the current GNU/Hurd. So we have to get creative. Having a cloud provider based on <a href="https://www.openstack.org/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">OpenStack</a> would be nice, since we have to tweak the image parameters directly using command line tools. I use <a href="https://fuga.cloud/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Fuga Cloud</a>.</p><p id="212c">First, download and deploy the image.</p><pre><span id="a5ed">$ wget http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/ports/12.0/hurd-i386/debian-hurd.img.tar.xz<br>$ tar xJf debian-hurd.img.tar.xz</span></pre><p id="e359">This is a 5GB pre-installed image, consisting of 4GB of user space and 1GB of swap space. This should be enough for now, since GNU/Hurd is a tiny OS compared to Linux.</p><p id="7cdf">The next thing you need is an OpenStack command-line tool. For Debian or Ubuntu, for example, there is a <a href="https://packages.debian.org/bookworm/python3-openstackclient" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">python3-openstackclient</a> package. I have no experience with it, but it seems to be available for Windows as well. Then you have to do some setup. Fuga Cloud’s OpenStack CLI tutorials (<a href="https://docs.fuga.cloud/how-to-use-the-openstack-cli-tools-on-linux" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">for Linux</a>, f<a href="https://docs.fuga.cloud/how-to-use-the-openstack-cli-tools-on-windows" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">or Windows</a>) are useful even if you don’t use them.</p><p id="dd47">Now you need to upload the image to the cloud. You need to set the properties: “hw_disk_bus” to “ide” and “hw_vif_model” to “e1000” (or “rtl8139”) as these are only supported devices on GNU/Hurd. Also, uploading may take some time. A progress bar ( — progress) would be nice.</p><pre><span id="57c1">$ openstack image create --property hw_disk_bus=ide --property hw_cdrom_bus=ide --property hw_vif_model=e1000 --disk-format raw --container-format bare "Debian GNU/Hurd 2023" --file debian-hurd.img --progress</span></pre><p id="7af4">After that, you can use the OpenStack web interface to create an instance based on the custom image you just uploaded. I am using one of Fuga Cloud’s cheapest plans (“t2.small”: 1 CPU, 1.23 GB RAM, 20 GiB SSD), but it seems to be enough.</p><p id="dd52">After booting (via GRUB), open the console for now from OpenStack and log in as “root” (the password is empty, so simply hit Enter). After that, you can immediately create your own user account.</p><pre><span id="a26e"># adduser yourloginname</span></pre><figure><figcaption>A gnu will welcome you.</figcaption></figure><p id="c8dd">This image is prepared to configure the network with DHCP, so you should already be able to log in with SSH (using your user account’s login password) once the instance is booted. Then, you put your SSH public key in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys, and you can SSH login as usual.</p><p id="496e">Everything else can be handled similarly to Debian GNU/Linux, because it is Debian after all. If you are using it as a server that is open to the outside world, don’t forget to set the root password.</p><h2 id="c90b">Why GNU/Hurd?</h2><p id="f7bf">GNU/Hurd has a number of interesting features. The most famous of these is probably the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd/translator.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">translator</a>. The translator allows users to create local implementations of the programs that handle access to specific directories and files. It is like a supercharged version of mount. It implements symbolic links, sockets, etc. The translator provides extreme flexibility.</p><p id="f34d">It is possible to run multiple instances of the Hurd on a single instance of GNU Mach, the microkernel. It’s called <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd/neighborhurd.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">neighborhurd</a>. Each neighborhurd is essentially isolated, so it’s like a supercharged Docker. There is also <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd/subhurd.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">subhurd</a>, which uses some of the resources provided by another Hurd.</p><p id="f0df">Personally, one reason for using GNU/Hurd is that the Linux kernel has become too huge. Look at this:</p><figure><figcaption>Source Lines of Code Comparison. Measured by David A Wheeler’s <a href="https://dwheeler.com/sloccount/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">SLOCCount</a>.</figcaption></figure><p id="1f5c">I don’t think that anyone is able to grasp the full picture of Linux anymore. It was also said that the Hurd would never be finished because it was too complex and too large. That is no longer the case. <strong>GNU/Hurd is a relatively small OS!</strong> Maybe the development of the microkernel and the Hurd required the development of Linux and the development of virtualization after all.</p><p id="83ac">Also, there are a variety of interesting budding operating systems, but they are largely experimental and often not practically usable; the GNU/Hurd is Unix(POSIX)-compatible, so most things work (roughly 65% of the Debian archive can be built for the Hurd).</p><h2 id="fdfe">Challenges</h2><p id="852e">One big problem would be systemd. systemd has not yet (or forever) been ported to the Hurd. systemd is very popular in the Linux world these days, and there are many packages that depend on systemd. <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/shepherd/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">GNU shepherd</a> is promising, but not yet complete.</p><p id="0922">As mentioned above, hardware support for GNU/Hurd is poor, but it is hard to rewrite device drivers from scratch now. <a href="https://rumpkernel.github.io/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Rump Kernels</a> is an interesting solution and is being actively implemented (<a href="https://archive.fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/dzammit/attachments/slides/4850/export/events/attachments/dzammit/slides/4850/rump_hurd_talk.pdf" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">a nice recent FOSDEM presentation PDF</a>).</p><p id="2ee0">And, of course, there are a whole lot of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/open_issues.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">open issues</a>.</p><h2 id="153c">Conclusion</h2><p id="e992"><strong>Try GNU/Hurd</strong>! I enjoy it a lot. It’s an old world and a new world. I am pretty sure you will like it too.</p><h2 id="b9a0"><strong>Further Resources</strong></h2><ul><li id="9dd8"><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">The Official site of GNU Hurd</a></li><li id="e032"><a href="https://www.debian.org/ports/hurd/index.en.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">The Official site of Debian GNU/Hurd</a></li><li id="0938"><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/mailing_lists.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Mailing Lists and its archives</a></li><li id="c81e"><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/irc.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">IRC</a> (Looks like this is still the official communication channel in 2023…)</li></ul><h2 id="11ea">The Source Code of the Hurd</h2><p id="6f7e">They are all managed by Git.</p><ul><li id="fdb1"><a href="https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/hurd/gnumach.git" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">GNU Mach</a></li><li id="a567"><a href="https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/hurd/hurd.git/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">GNU Hurd</a></li><li id="24c9"><a href="https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/hurd/mig.git/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">GNU MIG</a></li></ul></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><h2>TL;DR</h2><p>WarpStream is a Kafka protocol compatible data streaming platform built directly on top of S3. It's delivered as a single, stateless Go binary so there are no local disks to manage, no brokers to rebalance, and no ZooKeeper to operate. WarpStream is 5-10x cheaper than Kafka in the cloud because data streams directly to and from S3 instead of using inter-zone networking, which can be over 80% of the infrastructure cost of a Kafka deployment at scale.</p><p>If you just want to get your hands dirty, you can try <a href="https://docs.warpstream.com/warpstream/tutorials/demo" target="_blank">our demo</a> in under 30s.</p><p>Otherwise, read on!</p><h2>Kafka is Dead, Long Live Kafka</h2><p>Chances are you probably had a strong reaction to the title of this post. In our experience, Kafka is one of the most polarizing technologies in the data space. Some people hate it, some people swear by it, but almost every technology company uses it.</p><p>Kafka was first open sourced in 2011, and quickly became the default infrastructure for building streaming architectures. Jay Kreps' now well-known <a href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/distributed-systems/log-what-every-software-engineer-should-know-about-real-time-datas-unifying" target="_blank">The Log</a> blog post is still one of my favorite blog posts ever because it walks through why the distributed log abstraction that Kafka provides is so powerful.</p><p>But it’s not 2011 anymore. A lot has changed about how we build modern software, primarily a major shift towards cloud environments, and yet Kafka has remained more or the less the same. Many organizations have managed to “lift and shift” Kafka into their cloud environments, but let’s be honest, nobody is really happy with the result. Kafka is expensive, finicky, and difficult to run for most organizations who use it.</p><p>Kafka <em>itself</em> is not the problem. It’s a great piece of software that was well suited for the environment it was created for: LinkedIn’s data centers in 2011. However, it is an unusually poor fit for modern workloads for two reasons:</p><ol role="list"><li>Cloud economics – by design, Kafka’s replication strategy will rack up massive inter AZ bandwidth costs.</li><li>Operational overhead – running your own Kafka cluster literally requires a dedicated team and sophisticated custom tooling.</li></ol><p>We're going to pick on Kafka for the rest of this post, but keep in mind that everything we're saying about Kafka applies equally to any similar system that stores data on locals disks (however briefly), regardless of which programming language its implemented in.</p><h2>Kafka-nomics</h2><p>The diagram below depicts a typical 3 availability zone Kafka cluster:&nbsp;</p><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/64baaecd9c5c9b1b6c38aa0e/64c00427b989db231aac3e45_kafka_arch.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Every GiB of data that is produced must be written cross zone 2/3rds of the time<sup>1</sup>, and subsequently replicated by the partition leader to the followers in the other two zones for durability and availability reasons. Every time a GiB of data is transferred across zones, it costs $0.02<sup>2</sup>, $0.01 for egress in the source zone and $0.01 for ingress in the destination zone.</p><p>$0.01*⅔ + $0.02 *2 == $0.053 for every GiB of data that you stream through your Kafka cluster <em>in the best case scenario<sup>3</sup></em>. The cost of storing a GiB of data in S3 <em>for a month</em> is only $0.021<sup>4</sup>, so for the same price as copying data from a producer to a consumer via Kafka, you could store that data in S3 <em>for over two months</em>. In practice, for any Kafka cluster with substantial throughput, the hardware costs are negligible since 70-90% of the cost of the workload is just inter-zone bandwidth fees. <a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/understanding-and-optimizing-your-kafka-costs-part-1-infrastructure/#networking" target="_blank">Confluent has a good write up about this problem as well</a>.</p><p>It’s important to stress that this inter-AZ bandwidth problem is fundamental to how Kafka works. Kafka was designed to run in LinkedIn’s data centers, where the network engineers didn’t charge their application developers for moving data around. But today, most Kafka users are running it on a public cloud, an environment with completely different constraints and cost models. Unfortunately, unless your organization can commit to 10s or 100s of millions of dollars per year in cloud spend, there is no escaping the physics of this problem.</p><p>It’s not just a question of throughput either, even a low throughput Kafka cluster with long retention can have large storage requirements. In this case, Kafka’s approach of triply replicating the data on expensive local SSDs costs roughly 10-20x more<sup>5</sup> per GiB than using object storage like S3 assuming the <em>best case scenario of 100% disk utilization.</em></p><h2>Accidental SRE</h2><p>Most developers first encounter Kafka because they have a real problem they want to solve. However, before they can begin solving their problems, they must first learn about:</p><ol role="list"><li>Kafka (brokers, coordinators, watermarks, etc)</li><li>ZooKeeper (or KRaft)</li><li>Leader elections</li><li>Partitions (how many partitions do I need? Unclear, but better get it right because you can never change it!)</li><li>Consumer groups</li><li>Rebalancing</li><li>Broker tuning</li><li>Client tuning</li><li>etc</li></ol><p>Kafka’s “data plane” (brokers) and consensus-based “control plane” (controllers, ZooKeeper, etc) all run directly on local SSDs that must be managed with expertise and care. In practice, self-hosted Kafka clusters require a dedicated team of experts and significant amounts of custom tooling before even basic operations like node replacements and scaling clusters can be performed safely and reliably. For example, the Apache Kafka built in partition reassignment tool cannot even generate plans for decommissioning brokers when you (inevitably) experience a hardware failure:</p><blockquote>The partition reassignment tool does not have the ability to automatically generate a reassignment plan for decommissioning brokers yet. As such, the admin has to come up with a reassignment plan to move the replica for all partitions hosted on the broker to be decommissioned, to the rest of the brokers. This can be relatively tedious as the reassignment needs to ensure that all the replicas are not moved from the decommissioned broker to only one other broker.</blockquote><p>In many cases, offloading cluster management to a hosted provider like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/msk/" target="_blank">AWS MSK</a> doesn’t even solve the operational burden problem. For example, the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/msk/latest/developerguide/bestpractices.html#bestpractices-balance-cluster" target="_blank">MSK documentation on how to rebalance a cluster</a> (a very routine operation) just links to the <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#basic_ops_cluster_expansion" target="_blank">Apache Kafka documentation</a> which involves hand-editing JSON to specify which partitions should be migrated to which brokers and includes helpful commentary like:</p><blockquote>The partition reassignment tool does not have the capability to automatically study the data distribution in a Kafka cluster and move partitions around to attain an even load distribution. As such, the admin has to figure out which topics or partitions should be moved around.</blockquote><p>There are open source solutions like <a href="https://github.com/linkedin/cruise-control" target="_blank">Cruise Control</a> that can help ease this burden, but that is yet another set of concepts that need to learned, services that need to deployed and monitored, and sharp edges that need to be encountered. Cruise Control itself is a JVM&nbsp;application that depends on both Apache Kafka and ZooKeeper. Hardly a lightweight solution.</p><p>Unfortunately, in many cases developers set out to solve a business problem, and end up becoming Kafka SREs instead.</p><h2>S3 Is All You Need</h2><p>The high costs of using Kafka (both in dollars and engineering hours) means that today businesses can only afford to use it for their most high value use-cases like fraud detection and CDC. The cost of entry is simply too high for anything else.</p><p>When we were at Datadog, we built <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/engineering/introducing-husky/" target="_blank">Husky, a columnar database purpose-built for observability data that ran directly on top of S3.</a> When we were done, we had a (mostly) stateless and auto scaling data lake that was extremely cost effective, never ran out of disk space, and was trivial to operate. Almost overnight our Kafka clusters suddenly looked <em>ancient</em> by comparison.</p><p>Kafka bandwidth volumes at Datadog were measured in double-digit GiB/s and broker storage was measured in PiB’s of NVMEs<sup>6</sup>. Maintaining this level of infrastructure using open source Kafka, custom tooling, and bare VMs was no small feat. Luckily the responsible engineering teams at Datadog were extremely capable and made it work, but even after many years of investment, the automation simply couldn’t compete with the millions of engineering hours that have gone into making systems like S3 extremely robust, scalable, cost effective, <em>and elastic</em>.</p><p>In general, large storage workloads running in cloud environments stand no chance of competing with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc3J4McebHE" target="_blank">economics, reliability, scalability, and elasticity of object storage</a>. This is why “big data” technologies like Snowflake and Databricks don’t even try. Instead, they <em>lean into</em> cloud economics by designing their systems from the ground up around commodity object storage.</p><p>Companies like Uber, Datadog, and many others have made Kafka work for them despite all of its flaws. But there are <em>so many </em>interesting problems that will never get solved if the existing Kafka implementation remains the barrier to entry. That’s why we care about this space, and that’s why we set out to build something that would make data streaming infrastructure as accessible as S3.</p><p>If we could build a Kafka-like system directly on top of S3, that would solve two of the major problems with Kafka in one fell swoop; costs would be massively reduced, and most traditional Kafka operational headaches would disappear overnight. No major cloud provider charges for networking costs between VMs and object storage, and AWS employs literally <em>hundreds</em> of engineers whose only job is to make sure that S3 runs reliably and scales infinitely, so you don’t have to.</p><p>Of course, that’s easier said than done, and there is a good reason no one has done it yet: figuring out how to build low latency streaming infrastructure on-top of a high latency storage medium like S3, while still providing the full semantics of the Kafka protocol, without introducing <em>any</em> local disks, is a very tricky problem!</p><p>So we asked ourselves: “What would Kafka look like if it was redesigned from the ground up <em>today</em> to run in modern cloud environments, directly on top of object storage, with no local disks to manage, but still had to support the existing Kafka protocol?”</p><p>WarpStream is our answer to that question.</p><h2>Introducing WarpStream</h2><p>WarpStream is a Kafka protocol compatible data streaming platform that runs directly on top of any commodity object store (AWS&nbsp;S3, GCP&nbsp;GCS, Azure Blob Storage, etc). It incurs zero inter-AZ bandwidth costs, has no local disks to manage, and can run completely within your VPC.</p><p>That’s a lot to digest, so let’s unpack it by comparing WarpStream’s architecture to Kafka’s:</p><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/64baaecd9c5c9b1b6c38aa0e/64cea23a28ed31049a11cfbf_with1%20(1).png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Instead of Kafka brokers, WarpStream has “Agents”. Agents are stateless Go binaries (no JVM!) that speak the Kafka protocol, but unlike a traditional Kafka broker, any WarpStream Agent can act as the “leader” for any topic, commit offsets for any consumer group, or act as the coordinator for the cluster. No Agent is special, so auto-scaling them based on CPU-usage or network bandwidth is trivial.</p><p>How did we accomplish this if Apache Kafka requires running Apache ZooKeeper (or KRaft) and a bunch of stateful brokers with local SSDs and replication?</p><ol role="list"><li>We separated storage and compute (by offloading data to S3)</li><li>We separated data from metadata (by offloading metadata to a custom metadata store)</li></ol><p>Offloading all storage to object storage like S3 allows users to trivially scale the number of WarpStream Agents in response to changes in load with <em>zero data rebalancing</em>. It also enables faster recovery from failures because any request can be retried on another Agent immediately. It also mostly eliminates hotspots, where some Kafka brokers would have dramatically higher load than others due to uneven amounts of data in each partition. That means you can say goodbye to manually rebalancing partitions, and don't need to learn about complex solutions like Cruise Control.</p><p>The other pillar of WarpStream's design is separating data from metadata, just like a modern data lake does. We store the metadata for every WarpStream “Virtual Cluster” in a custom metadata database that was written from the ground up to solve this exact problem in the most performant and cost effective way possible. In fact, we’re so confident in the efficiency of our metadata store, we’ll host WarpStream Virtual Clusters for you <a href="https://warpstream.com/pricing"><em>for free</em></a>.</p><p>You can read more about <a href="https://docs.warpstream.com/warpstream/background-information/warpstreams-architecture" target="_blank">WarpStream’s architecture in our documentation</a>, but to summarize: WarpStream offloads all of the hard problems of data replication, durability, and availability to an object storage bucket so you never have to think about it, but all of your data <em>stays inside your cloud account</em>. The only data that ever leaves your cloud account with WarpStream is the workload <em>metadata</em> that is required for consensus, like the order of the batches in your partitions.</p><p>Modern practitioners who want to introduce large scale data streaming pipelines into their infrastructure today don’t have many good choices. They either have to spend a lot of money <em>and</em> create an entire dedicated team of engineers whose only job is to operate Kafka, or they have to pay a vendor for a hosted solution and spend <em>even more money</em>, making many of their streaming use-cases economically infeasible.</p><p>We think WarpStream can provide a better option that leverages the cloud as a strength instead of a weakness, and unlocks a whole new set of possibilities in the data streaming world.</p><p>You don’t just have to take our word for it though, we brought receipts! The image below shows the interzone networking costs of our entire cloud account (measured using the excellent <a href="https://www.vantage.sh/" target="_blank">vantage.sh</a>), including the continuous streaming workload we run in our test environment. This workload continuously produces 140MiB/s of data and consumes it with three dedicated consumers for a total of 560MiB/s in continuous data transfer.</p><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/64baaecd9c5c9b1b6c38aa0e/64c035b364da3c257915926f_Screenshot%202023-07-25%20at%203.49.10%20PM.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>You can see that we average &lt; $15/day in interzone networking fees, whereas the exact same workload run using a Kafka cluster would cost 0.14GiB * $0.053/GiB * 60 * 60 * 24 == <strong>$641</strong> <strong>per day</strong> <strong>in interzone networking fees alone.</strong></p><p>We didn’t just replace these interzone networking costs with hardware or S3 API costs either. This same workload costs &lt; $40/day in S3 API operation costs:</p><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/64baaecd9c5c9b1b6c38aa0e/64c035bcfda4aa35de9d76ef_Screenshot%202023-07-25%20at%203.50.11%20PM.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>It also only requires 27 vCPUs worth of Agent hardware / VMs.</p><p>In terms of total cost of ownership, WarpStream will reduce the cost of most Kafka workloads by 5-10x. For example, here is a comparison of the cost of running a sustained 1GiB/s Kafka workload vs the equivalent using WarpStream:</p><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/64baaecd9c5c9b1b6c38aa0e/64d060d06b645b27d6a23140_Screenshot%202023-08-06%20at%2010.10.56%20PM.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Footnote 7 for self hosted Kafka hardware costs, footnote 8 for self hosted Kafka network costs.<strong> Note that this table assumes the best case scenario that the Kafka cluster is properly configured to use the follower fetch functionality to reduce interzone networking costs for consumers. If it’s not, the Kafka costs would be much higher.&nbsp;It also omits the cost of engineering salaries for the self hosted Kafka setup.</strong></figcaption></figure><p>The table above demonstrates clearly that for high volume Kafka workloads, the hardware costs are negligible because the cost of the workload is dominated by inter-zone networking fees. WarpStream eliminates those networking fees entirely.</p><p>Of course, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. Engineering is about trade-offs, and we’ve made a significant one with WarpStream: latency. The current implementation has a P99 of ~400ms for Produce requests because we never acknowledge data until it has been durably persisted in S3 and committed to our cloud control plane. In addition, our current P99 latency of data end-to-end from producer-to-consumer is around 1s:</p><figure><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/64baaecd9c5c9b1b6c38aa0e/64bff6c3e52acac923301fa7_CaSz12FWNfCOGHT2snOa6q1erJeqvhESfRx_X6ZHt-Fe81JVVgRlXk9wvSamfMnzG5Epjwl5VARA176g8k-kmAGiTancoQOoBT1iDZJgjKXceXv-XFKsnEn2ncDGM4rjeCja_JriSlDDn7LQ9B8vh5o.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>If your workload can tolerate a P99 of ~1s of producer-to-consumer latency, then WarpStream can reduce your total data streaming costs by 5-10x per GiB, with <em>almost</em> zero operational overhead. We don’t have a proprietary interface either; it’s just Kafka, so there is no vendor lock in. Finally, WarpStream runs in any environment with an object store implementation, so we can meet you where you’re at with S3 in AWS, GCS in GCP, and Azure Blob Storage in Azure.</p><p>If you’ve made it this far, you may have noticed that WarpStream mainly addresses two of the major problems with Kafka: cloud economics and operational overhead. We think that there is a third major problem with Kafka: developer UX. In our view, partitions are way too low level of an abstraction to program against for writing any non-trivial stream processing application, and we think that WarpStream’s architecture puts us in a unique position to help developers write stream processing applications in a novel way that’s much closer to how they’re used to writing traditional applications.</p><p>We’ll talk about that more in a future blog post, but the first thing we wanted to do is meet developers where they are and offer them an improved version of a tool they’re already familiar with.</p><p>WarpStream is currently in developer preview.

<p><strong>NAIROBI, Kenya, Aug 7 – Police raided a warehouse belonging to WorldCoin cryptocurrency in Nairobi and carted away documents over the weekend.</strong>



</p><p>The officers went to the offices along Mombasa Road armed with a search warrant and left with machines they believe stores data gathered by the firm.



</p><p>The team took the data to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations headquarters for analysis.



</p><p>Data Commissioner Immaculate Kassait defended her office and said Tools for Humanity, the parent company of Worldcoin, failed to disclose its true intentions during registration.



</p><p>The government has suspended Worldcoin’s operations in Kenya, citing security concerns paving the way for investigations into the activities of the company.



</p><p>However, privacy experts worry that sensitive data gathered from scanning a person’s iris might get into the wrong hands.



</p><p>The Kenyan Capital Markets Authority (CMA) stated it was concerned about the ongoing registration and notified Kenyans that Worldcoin was not regulated in Kenya.



</p><p>Under Kenyan law, individuals have a right to not have any personal information unnecessarily required or unnecessarily revealed.



</p><p>Worldcoin, founded by US tech entrepreneur Sam Altman, offers free crypto tokens to people who agree to have their eyeballs scanned.</p>



<p>&nbsp;On Thursday, Worldcoin said it is planning to implement crowd-control measures and collaborate with the government before resuming work.



</p><p>Worldcoin, founded by US tech entrepreneur Sam Altman, offers free crypto tokens to people who agree to have their eyeballs scanned.



</p><p>It claims to be creating a new global “identity and financial network”.



</p><p>Altman, who founded Open AI, which built chat bot ChatGPT, says he hopes the initiative will help confirm if someone is a human or a robot. He also says this could lead to everyone being paid a universal basic income but it is not clear how.



</p><p>Worldcoin says it chose Kenya as the first African country to launch the platform because of the already booming tech space, and the more than four million Kenyans who are already trading in crypto.



</p><p>It has also launched in various countries including Indonesia, France Japan, Germany, Spain and the UK. Data watchdogs in some countries have already said they are examining Worldcoin.



</p><p>Interior Cabinet Secretary Kithure Kindiki suspended the firm’s activities in Kenya to pave the way for a probe into the legality of its operations.



</p><p>He Thursday appeared before Parliament to among other issues state the precautionary steps taken by the government on the already mined data.



</p><p>“The aforesaid entity is not registered as a legal entity in Kenya.”</p>

    </h3>
<p><span>Having a great mentor is fantastic, but mentors are not always available. Luckily, programming can</span>
<span>be mastered without a mentor, if you got past the initial learning step. When you code, you get </span><em><span>a</span>
<span>lot</span></em><span> of feedback, and, through trial and error, you can process the feedback to improve your skills.</span>
<span>In fact, the hardest bit is actually finding the problems to solve (and this article suggests many).</span>
<span>But if you have the problem, you can self-improve noticing the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>How you verify that the solution works.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>Common bugs and techniques to avoid them in the future.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>Length of the solution: can you solve the problem using shorter, simpler code?</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>Techniques </span>—<span> can you apply anything you</span>’<span>ve read about this week? How would the problem be solved</span>
<span>in Haskell? Could you apply pattern from language X in language Y?</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>In this context it is important to solve the same problem repeatedly. E.g., you could try solving</span>
<span>the same model problem in all languages you know, with a month or two break between attempts.</span>
<span>Repeatedly doing the same thing and noticing differences and similarities between tries is the</span>
<span>essence of self-learning.</span></p>

    <h3>
    <a href="#On-Programming-Languages"><span>On Programming Languages</span> </a>
    </h3>
<p><span>Learning your first programming language is a nightmare, because you are learning your editing</span>
<span>environment (PyScripter, IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code) first, simple algorithms second, and the language</span>
<span>itself third. It gets much easier afterwards!</span></p>
<p><span>Learning different programming languages is one of the best way to improve your programming skills.</span>
<span>By seeing what</span>’<span>s similar, and what</span>’<span>s different, you deeper learn how the things work under the hood.</span>
<span>Different languages put different idioms to the forefront, and learning several expands your</span>
<span>vocabulary considerably. As a bonus, after learning N languages, learning N+1st becomes a question</span>
<span>of skimming through the official docs.</span></p>
<p><span>In general, you want to cover big families of languages: Python, Java, Haskell, C, Rust, Clojure</span>
<span>would be a good baseline. Erlang, Forth, and Prolog would be good additions afterwards.</span></p>

<section id="On-Algorithms">

    <h3>
    <a href="#On-Algorithms"><span>On Algorithms</span> </a>
    </h3>
<p><span>There are three levels of learning algorithms</span></p>
<dl>
<dt><span>Level 1</span></dt>
<dd>
<p><span>You are not actually learning algorithms, you are learning programming. At this stage, it doesn</span>’<span>t</span>
<span>matter how long your code is, how pretty it is, or how efficient it is. The only thing that</span>
<span>matters is that it solve the problem. Generally, this level ends when you are fairly comfortable</span>
<span>with recursion. Few first problems from Project Euler are a great resource here.</span></p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Level 2</span></dt>
<dd>
<p><span>Here you learn algorithms proper. The goal here is mostly encyclopedic knowledge of common</span>
<span>techniques. There are quite a few, but not too many of those. At this stage, the most useful thing</span>
<span>is understanding the math behind the algorithms </span>—<span> being able to explain algorithm using</span>
<span>pencil&amp;paper, prove its correctness, and analyze Big-O runtime. Generally, you want to learn the</span>
<span>name of algorithm or technique, read and grok the full explanation, and then implement it.</span></p>
<p><span>I recommend doing an abstract implementation first (i.e., not </span>“<span>HashMap to solve problem X</span>”<span>, but</span>
“<span>just HashMap</span>”<span>). Include tests in your implementation. Use randomized testing (e.g., when testing</span>
<span>sorting algorithms, don</span>’<span>t use a finite set of example, generate a million random ones).</span></p>
<p><span>It</span>’<span>s OK and even desirable to implement the same algorithm multiple times. When solving problems,</span>
<span>like CSES, you </span><em><span>could</span></em><span> abstract your solutions and re-use them, but it</span>’<span>s better to code everything</span>
<span>from scratch every time, until you</span>’<span>ve fully internalized the algorithm.</span></p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Level 3</span></dt>
<dd>
<p><span>One day, long after I</span>’<span>ve finished my university, I was a TA for an algorithms course. The lecturer</span>
<span>for the course was the person who originally taught me to program, through a similar algorithms</span>
<span>course. And, during one coffee break, he said something like</span></p>

<figure>
<blockquote><p><span>We don</span>’<span>t teach algorithms so that students can code Dijkstra with their eyes closed on the job.</span>
<span>They probably won</span>’<span>t have to code any fancy algorithms themselves.</span></p>
<p><span>We teach algorithms so that students learn to think about invariants and properties when writing</span>
<span>code. Real-life code is usually simple enough that it mostly works if you just throw spaghetti</span>
<span>onto the wall. But it doesn</span>’<span>t always work. To write correct, robust code at work, you need to</span>
<span>think about invariants.</span></p>
<p><span>The trick with algorithms is that coding them is hard. The only way to avoid bugs is to force</span>
<span>yourself to think in terms of invariants.</span></p>
</blockquote>

</figure>
<p><span>I was thunderstruck! I didn</span>’<span>t realize that</span>’<span>s the reason why I am learning (well, teaching at that</span>
<span>point) algorithms! Before, I always muddled through my algorithms by randomly tweaking generally</span>
<span>correct stuff until it works. E.g., with a binary search, just add </span><code>+1</code><span> somewhere until it doesn</span>’<span>t</span>
<span>loop on random arrays. After hearing this advice, I went home and wrote my millionth binary</span>
<span>search, but this time I actually added comments with loop invariants, and it worked from the first</span>
<span>try! I applied similar techniques for the rest of the course, and since then my subjective</span>
<span>perception of bug rate (for normal work code) went down dramatically.</span></p>
<p><span>So this is the third level of algorithms </span>—<span> you hone your coding skills to program without bugs.</span>
<span>If you are already fairly comfortable with algorithms, try doing CSES again. But this time, spend</span>
<span>however much you need double-checking the code </span><em><span>before</span></em><span> submission, but try to get everything</span>
<span>correct on the first try.</span></p>

<p><span>A very powerful exercise is coding a medium-sized project from scratch. Something that takes more</span>
<span>than a day, but less than a week, and has a meaningful architecture which can be just right, or</span>
<span>messed up. Here are some great projects to do:</span></p>
<dl>
<dt><span>Ray Tracer</span></dt>
<dd>
<p><span>Given an analytical description of a 3D scene, convert it to a colored 2D image, by simulating a</span>
<span>path of a ray of light as it bounces off objects.</span></p>

<dd>
<p><span>Given a description of a 3D scene as a set of triangles, convert it to a colored 2D image by</span>

</dd>
<dt><span>Dynamically Typed Programming Language</span></dt>
<dd>
<p><span>An </span><em><span>interpreter</span></em><span> which reads source code as text, parses it into an AST, and directly executes the</span>
<span>AST (or maybe converts AST to the byte code fore some speed up)</span></p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Statically Typed Programming Language</span></dt>
<dd>
<p><span>A </span><em><span>compiler</span></em><span> which reads source code as text, and spits out a binary (WASM would be a terrific</span>
<span>target).</span></p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Relational Database</span></dt>
<dd>
<p><span>Several components:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>Storage engine, which stores data durably on disk and implements on-disk ordered data structures</span>
<span>(B-tree or LSM)</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>Relational data model which is implemented on top of primitive ordered data structures.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>Relational language to express schema and queries.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>Either a TCP server to accept transactions as a database server, or an API for embedding for an</span>
<span>in-processes </span>“<span>embedded</span>”<span> database.</span>
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt><span>Chat Server</span></dt>
<dd>
<p><span>An exercise in networking and asynchronous programming. Multiple client programs connect to a</span>
<span>server program. A client can send a message either to a specific different client, or to all other</span>
<span>clients (broadcast). There are many variations on how to implement this: blocking read/write</span>
<span>calls, </span><code>epoll</code><span>, </span><code>io_uring</code><span>, threads, callbacks, futures, manually-coded state machines.</span></p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><span>Again, it</span>’<span>s more valuable to do the same exercise six times with variations, than to blast through</span>
<span>everything once.</span></p>

<p>Processor companies typically iterate off proven designs, and for good reason. Changing too many things at once introduces a lot of risk. A lot of changing parts makes it hard to get a good picture of overall performance, so it also makes tuning difficult. Pentium 4 and Bulldozer made clean breaks from prior architectures, and both were unsuccessful designs. But sometimes, making a clean break does pay off.</p>
<p>Sandy Bridge is one such case. It inherited architectural features from Intel’s prior P6 and Netburst architectures, but can’t be considered a member of either line. Unlike Netburst, Sandy Bridge was so successful that Intel’s high performance cores to this day can trace their lineage to back to it. In the early 2010s, Sandy Bridge was so successful that Intel went completely unchallenged in the high end CPU market. And as a testament to the architecture’s solid design, Sandy Bridge CPUs still deliver enough performance to remain usable across a range of everyday tasks.</p>
<h2>Block Diagram</h2>
<p>Sandy Bridge is a four-wide, out-of-order architecture with three ALU ports and two AGU ports. The same applies to prior generations from the P6 family. Core 2 (Merom) and the first generation Core i7/5/3 CPUs (Nehalem) were also four-wide, and have the same execution port count. But core width and execution resources are one thing, and feeding them is another. Sandy Bridge is far better at keeping itself fed, thanks to improvements throughout the pipeline and cache hierarchy.</p>

<h2>Frontend: Branch Prediction</h2>
<p>Branch prediction is vital to CPU performance, especially for out-of-order CPUs that can speculate far ahead of a branch. Sandy Bridge dramatically advances branch predictor performance compared to Nehalem, and can recognize much longer patterns. According to Microprocessor Report (MPR), Sandy Bridge does not use classic 2-bit counters for its history table. Instead, entries use 1-bit counters, with a “confidence” bit shared across multiple entries. Thus, Sandy Bridge was able to implement a larger history table with the same amount storage.</p>
<figure><p><img data-lazy-fallback="1" decoding="async" loading="lazy" id="17954" src="https://i0.wp.com/chipsandcheese.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/snb_branchhist.png?ssl=1" alt="" width="1161" height="690" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/chipsandcheese.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/snb_branchhist.png?ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><img data-lazy-fallback="1" decoding="async" loading="lazy" id="17955" src="https://i1.wp.com/chipsandcheese.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/westmere_branchhist.png?ssl=1" alt="" width="1157" height="690" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/chipsandcheese.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/westmere_branchhist.png?ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p></figure>
<p>A larger history table lets Sandy Bridge recognize longer patterns when there are a few difficult to predict branches, and avoid destructive aliasing when a lot of branches are in play. Intel made a large improvement in direction prediction, and that’s important because Sandy Bridge can speculate farther than Nehalem can.</p>
<h3>Branch Target Tracking</h3>
<p>Intel made similar optimizations to the branch target buffer (BTB), a structure that remembers where branches went so the branch predictor can steer the frontend with minimal delay. Instead of directly holding branch targets, Sandy Bridge stores branch offsets and adds those to the current program counter to calculate the branch target. Most branches jump short distances, so most BTB entries can be small. MPR further states that Nehalem’s BTB had 64 bit entries, which I find very unlikely. x86-64 virtual addresses are only 48 bits wide, and Nehalem uses 40-bit physical addressing. Using 64-bits to store a branch target would be an exercise in stupidity because the upper 16 bits would always be zero. Maybe 64 bits refers to the total size of the BTB entry, including tag and state bits.</p>
<p>Compared to Nehalem, Sandy Bridge doubles the BTB capacity from 2048 entries to 4096 entries. Intel accomplished this doubling of capacity with no penalty, which is quite an impressive feat. AMD’s Bulldozer increased BTB capacity from 2048 entries in K10 to 5120 entries, but had to do so by adding a slower BTB level.</p>

<p>Sandy Bridge’s main BTB has 2 cycles of latency. That matches Bulldozer’s 512 entry L1 BTB, and is much faster than Bulldozer’s 5 cycle L2 BTB. However, 2 cycle latency still means the frontend loses a cycle after a taken branch. To mitigate this, Sandy Bridge can handle up to eight branches with single cycle latency, possibly by using a very fast L0 BTB. AMD didn’t get similar capability until Zen released in 2017.</p>
<p>Interestingly, I was unable to reach full BTB capacity. However, Matt Godbolt has run extensive tests to <a href="https://xania.org/201602/haswell-and-ivy-btb">measure BTB capacity on Ivy Bridge</a> (the 22nm die shrink of Sandy Bridge), and concluded that the BTB has 4096 entries. Furthermore, he measured 2048 BTB entries on Nehalem. </p>
<h3>Return Stack</h3>
<p>Returns are used to exit from a function back to the calling code, and are quite common. They’re also easy to predict, because returns will almost always match up with a function call. CPUs take advantage of this by using a stack to predict returns. Sandy Bridge’s return stack has 16 entries, which should be adequate for most cases. Bulldozer has a larger 24 entry return stack. AMD can cope better with deeply nested function calls, though there’s probably diminishing returns to increasing return stack depth.</p>
<h3>Indirect Branch Prediction</h3>
<p>Returns are a special case of indirect branches, or branches that go to multiple targets. Predicting indirect branch destinations is quite a bit more difficult, but also important because they’re commonly used for method calls in object oriented languages. </p>

<p>Sandy Bridge’s indirect predictor can track up to 128 targets, achieved with 64 branches going to two targets each. For a single branch, the predictor can pick between up to 24 targets.</p>
<h2>Frontend: Fetch and Decode</h2>
<p>Once the branch predictor has determined where to go, the frontend has to bring instructions into the core. Sandy Bridge’s frontend inherits features from Nehalem, but gets a new 1536 entry, 8-way micro-op cache. The micro-op cache holds decoded instructions, allowing the core to skip the traditional fetch and decode path. In that sense, it’s similar to Netburst’s trace cache. Both architectures can deliver instructions with lower power and lower latency when feeding the pipeline from the micro-op or trace cache. But Sandy Bridge doesn’t try to cache traces. Rather, micro-op cache lines directly correspond to 32-byte aligned memory regions. Compared to Netburst, Sandy Bridge gets better caching efficiency, because Netburst’s trace cache might store the same instruction many times to improve fetch bandwidth around taken branches.</p>

<p>But Sandy Bridge’s micro-op cache is still optimized for high speed and low power, rather than caching efficiency. It’s virtually addressed, meaning that program addresses don’t have to be translated to do a micro-op cache lookup. To maintain consistency between virtual and physical addresses (i.e. handle cases where the OS changes mappings between virtual and physical addresses), the L1 instruction cache and instruction TLB (iTLB) are inclusive of the micro-op cache. An iTLB miss implies a micro-op cache miss, and iTLB evictions can flush the micro-op cache. On top of that, some instruction patterns can’t be filled into the micro-op cache:</p>

<p>Therefore, Sandy Bridge’s micro-op cache augments the traditional fetch and decode mechanism instead of replacing it. Because micro-op cache hitrate isn’t expected to be as good as with a traditional L1i cache, the micro-op cache is used in a way that minimizes penalties when code spills out of it. Intel only transitions to the micro-op cache after a branch, meaning the frontend isn’t constantly checking the micro-op cache tags and wasting power when hitrate may be low.</p>
<p>Compared to its primary competitors and prior Intel architectures, Sandy Bridge can achieve excellent performance with small instruction footprints but relatively long instruction lengths. Dense compute kernels come to mind here, because they’ll use longer AVX instructions executing in small loops.</p>

<p>Once code spills out of the micro-op cache, frontend throughput takes a sharp drop. However, the L1 instruction cache can still provide enough bandwidth if instructions are around 4 bytes. Integer code typically has average instruction lengths a bit below 4 bytes.</p>

<p>If code spills out of the L1i, instruction throughput takes a sharp drop. But while it’s a step behind modern chips, it compares well to its competition. Bulldozer struggles even more if it has to fetch code from L2, though the large L1i should reduce how often that happens.</p>

<p>In the end, Sandy Bridge has a very complex frontend compared to prior Intel architectures, or indeed anything else of its time. The core can incredibly feed its pipeline from four different sources. At first, that sounds like a non-intuitive and complex solution. But imitation and longevity are the sincerest forms of flattery for microarchitecture design. Today, ARM and AMD use similar frontend strategies in their high performance cores, which speaks to the strength of Sandy Bridge’s design.</p>
<h2>Rename and Allocate</h2>
<p>After instructions have been converted into micro-ops, backend resources have to be allocated to track them and enable out-of-order execution. This stage is called the renamer, because it performs register renaming to break false dependencies. It’s also a convenient place to pull more tricks that expose additional parallelism to the backend. For example, operations that always result in zero can be set to have no dependencies. Register to register copies can be eliminated by manipulating the register alias tables. Sandy Bridge recognizes zeroing idioms, but Intel was not able to implement move elimination. That would have to wait until Ivy Bridge.</p>
<h2>Execution Engine</h2>
<p>Sandy Bridge’s out-of-order execution engine is a fresh design. At a high level, it’s Netburst but bigger and less stupid. By that, I mean it uses a PRF based execution scheme where data values are stored in physical register flies, and pointers to register file entries get moved around instead of the values themselves. Contrast that with P6’s ROB based execution scheme, which stores register values in the ROB. When an instruction retires, P6 copies its result from the ROB to a retired register file. Apparently, P6 also stored input values in its scheduler. That may have simplified design because all the info needed to execute a micro-op can come from the scheduler, but bloats scheduler size.</p>

Early P6 generations only had to move up to 80-bit values</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>These inefficiencies were probably fine on early P6 variants, where the largest register values were 80-bits wide. Nehalem’s 128-bit SSE registers were pushing things a bit, but growing transistor budgets and process improvements let it get by. Sandy Bridge is a different story. 256-bit AVX registers are no joke, and Intel needed to move those giant values around as little as possible. By going to a PRF based scheme, Intel was able to provide a full width AVX implementation while also greatly increasing reordering capacity.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>Structure</td><td>Applies if instruction…</td><td>Sandy Bridge</td><td>Nehalem</td></tr><tr><td>Reorder Buffer (ROB)</td><td>Exists</td><td>168 entry</td><td>128 entry</td></tr><tr><td>Integer Register File</td><td>Writes to an integer register</td><td>160 entry<br>~122 speculative</td><td>N/A (128 speculative)</td></tr><tr><td>FP/Vector Register File</td><td>Writes to a FP/vector register</td><td>144 entry<br>~113 speculative</td><td>N/A (128 speculative)</td></tr><tr><td>Load Queue</td><td>Reads from memory</td><td>64</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>Store Queue</td><td>Writes to memory</td><td>36</td><td>32</td></tr><tr><td>Branch Order Buffer</td><td>Affects control flow</td><td>48</td><td>N/A (128 speculative)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>Intel’s PRF implementation has some quirks as well. Apparently, Sandy Bridge has a Physical Register Reclaim Table (PRRT) structure in addition to separate freelists for each register file. The PRRT is responsible for telling the retirement stage what register (if any) can be reclaimed when an instruction retires, but notably doesn’t have enough entries to cover the entire ROB. </p>

<p>Sandy Bridge can therefore have its reordering capacity limited by how many total registers it can allocate, even if the relevant register file has free entries. </p>
<h3>Execution Units</h3>
<p>Once the scheduler has determined that a micro-op is ready for execution, it’s sent to Sandy Bridge’s six execution ports. It’s easier to think of this as five ports (three for math, two for memory), because a sixth port is only used to handle stores. Stores on Intel CPUs use both an AGU port and a store data port, so the store data port doesn’t allow higher instruction throughput.</p>
<p>Execution units are generally well distributed across the ports, but there are weak points compared to newer CPUs. That especially applies for vector and floating point execution. If code has a lot of shuffle operations, port 5 can see heavy load because it has to handle all vector shuffles and branches.</p>

<p>Floating point workloads dominated by adds or multiplies (but not a roughly even mix of both) could see port bottlenecks on ports 1 and 0, respectively. That’s really only a disadvantage compared to more modern architectures, as prior generations of Intel CPUs had similar limitations.</p>
<h3>Memory Execution</h3>
<p>Operations that access memory are sent down Sandy Bridge’s two address generation pipelines. Prior Intel architectures had specialized AGU pipes, with one for loads and the other for stores. Sandy Bridge uses a more flexible setup where both pipes can handle either loads or stores. Loads tend to be far more common than stores, so Sandy Bridge should see far less contention on the AGU ports.</p>

<p>However, AGU throughput is still a stumbling block for Sandy Bridge. Per-cycle, the L1D can theoretically service three accesses, but the AGUs can only provide two addresses. In 2013, Intel’s Haswell introduced a triple AGU setup, letting it sustain 3 memory operations per cycle. AMD did the same in 2019 with Zen 2. It’s not a big deal but newer CPUs do better.</p>
<h3>Memory Disambiguation, and Load/Store Penalites</h3>
<p>After addresses are calculated, the load/store unit has to make sure memory dependencies are satisfied. Loads that overlap with earlier in-flight stores have to get their data forwarded, but checking for partial overlaps can be complicated. Nehalem had a very sophisticated comparison mechanism, and could handle all cases where the store is completely contained within a later load. The same applies to Sandy Bridge, but the check appears to be done in two stages. </p>

<p>First, Sandy Bridge does a quick check to see if accesses overlap the same 4 byte aligned region. It only does a more thorough check if there is an overlap. Successful store forwarding has a latency of 5-6 cycles, while partial overlap cases take 17-18 cycles, or 24-25 cycles if they cross a cacheline boundary. Store forwarding is a lot less sophisticated for vector accesses. Sandy Bridge can only forward the lower or upper half of a 128-bit store, and does so with a latency of 7-8 cycles.</p>
<h3>Address Translation and Paging</h3>
<p>All modern operating systems rely on virtual memory to keep misbehaving processes from tripping over each other or bringing down the entire system. Virtual memory requires virtual program-visible addresses to be translated to physical addresses. Sandy Bridge uses a two-level cache of address translations to speed this up. First, a 64 entry DTLB can provide translations without penalty. If the L1 DTLB is missed, Sandy Bridge can get the translation from a 1024 entry L2 TLB, with an additional 7 cycles of latency.</p>
<p>Address translations get messy if an access crosses a page boundary, because the underlying data might be very far apart in physical memory. On Sandy Bridge, a split-page load costs 36 cycles, while a split-page store costs 25 cycles. Forwarding doesn’t work across page boundaries, where you can see a 36 cycle penalty if the store spans pages. If both the load and store cross a page boundary, the penalty goes to 53 cycles. Modern CPUs improve on these penalties, but Sandy Bridge already turns in a far better performance than its AMD competition.</p>
<h2>Cache Performance</h2>
<p>Intel standardized on a triple-level caching setup starting with Nehalem. Sandy Bridge carries the high level caching scheme forward, but with important improvements. Starting at L1, the improved AGU setup gives Sandy Bridge twice as much load bandwidth as Nehalem. L2 bandwidth also improves, though it’s nowhere near the 32 bytes per cycle that Sandy Bridge should be theoretically capable of. </p>

<p>At L3, we see a slight bandwidth advantage for Sandy Bridge. The Xeon X5650 and E5-1650 both serve their cores with 12 MB of L3 cache arranged into six slices, but do so very differently. Westmere and Nehalem use a centralized Global Queue (GQ) in front of the L3 cache. All L3 request tracking can happen at the GQ so that approach is probably easier to implement and verify.

<p>Higher core counts mean more L3 and memory requests in flight, so the GQ needs more entries to cope. A larger GQ means more requests to scan when making decisions on request priority<sup>2</sup>. All of this has to be handled with low latency. The GQ is not ideal for that either, because every request has to go through the centralized queue in the middle of the chip, even if the L3 slice holding the relevant data is quite close to the requesting core.</p>
<p>Sandy Bridge ditches the GQ in favor of a divide-and-conquer approach. L3 lookup and request tracking functionality gets distributed across the L3 slices, which are connected via a ring bus. The request scheduler at each L3 slice can be smaller than the GQ, and can run at core clocks. In the end, the ring bus delivers massive bandwidth advantages:</p>

<p>Even under heavy load, the E5-1650 (Sandy Bridge) can provide more than 9 bytes per cycle of bandwidth to each of its six cores. Each of the X5650’s cores in contrast can only average 4.7 bytes per cycle. Sandy Bridge’s advantage extends past bandwidth. Latency improves because requests can take a more direct route to the destination slice, instead of always going through GQ in the center of the die. Simpler request arbiters probably help latency too.</p>

<p>In terms of core clocks, Sandy Bridge drops latency by about 7 cycles. That’s already a good improvement. But we can only capture the magnitude of Sandy Bridge’s progress when we look at actual latency. 10.3 ns is an excellent figure for a 12 MB cache. I really have to give it to Intel’s engineers here because they delivered a massive leap in L3 performance even when their prior design would have had no problems competing against AMD.</p>

<p>However, Sandy Bridge doesn’t improve latency across the board. L2 latency regresses by two cycles compared to Nehalem, though the E5-1650’s higher clock speed means actual latency is very similar. 12 cycle L2 latency is very acceptable in any case.</p>
<h2>Cache Coherency Performance</h2>
<p>L3 performance is an excellent way to measure Sandy Bridge’s interconnect performance, because L3 traffic makes up most of the traffic going across the ring bus. Another way to check interconnect performance is testing how long it takes to bounce data between pairs of cores. While this form of traffic is quite rare and therefore less optimized, it can show the interconnect topology.</p>

The L3 keeps core valid bits alongside each line</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Sandy Bridge sees slightly varying core to core latencies, depending on how far cores are from the L3 slice that owns the cache slice. On Westmere and Nehalem, all requests flow through a centralized arbiter. Latencies are more uniform, and are uniformly higher. The E5-1650’s worst case is better than the X5650’s best case.</p>
<p>Alongside non-contested L3 performance, Sandy Bridge’s core-to-core latency performance demonstrates the excellence of its ring bus design. Again, imitation and longevity are the sincerest forms of flattery for CPU features. Today, Intel continues to use a ring bus in client CPUs, and AMD has done the same (starting with Zen 3).</p>
<h2>Final Words</h2>
<p>Sandy Bridge is now more than a decade old, but Intel architectures today can still trace their origins to iterative changes built on top of Sandy Bridge’s base. As another compliment to Sandy Bridge, its concepts have shown up in successful architectures outside of Intel. AMD’s Zen line uses a micro-op cache and a distributed L3 design, though implementation details differ. Micro-op caches also appear on ARM’s latest high performance designs.</p>
<p>Today, Sandy Bridge remains surprisingly usable, even if more modern CPUs beat it into the ground in head-to-head benchmarking. That’s because it does the important things right. Its branch predictor performs well. Out-of-order buffers are well balanced, and the pipeline in general has few penalties. Caches have low latency and adequate bandwidth. Modern CPUs do better in most of those categories, but are often chasing diminishing returns. In short, there’s not a lot that Sandy Bridge did wrong.</p>
<p>When Sandy Bridge does fall short compared to modern CPUs, it’s generally in specific categories of applications. For example, its execution port count looks absolutely anemic compared to CPUs just a generation later. But feeding the execution resources is more important than having a lot of them, so having fewer ports isn’t a big deal. Sandy Bridge also isn’t as wide as newer CPUs, but again core width is not as important as feeding that width. </p>
<p>Most impressively, Intel made enormous strides without serious competition. A slightly improved Nehalem would have been enough to beat AMD’s Bulldozer. Instead, Intel created a fresh design that left AMD completely in the dust. Then, Intel made iterative improvements that kept the company well ahead of any competition. When looking back at Sandy Bridge and the years after its release, I can’t help but miss the old Intel. Intel in the early 2010s was bold and confident, introducing performance and power efficiency improvements on a steady pace. Today’s Intel barely keeps its footing against a resurgent AMD. That said, Intel has a tradition of learning from setbacks and coming back stronger. They recovered from the Pentium FDIV bug and grew to dominate the PC market. They recovered from the misstep of Netburst to deliver Core 2, and then used what they learned from both architecture lines to create Sandy Bridge. Hopefully, Intel will have another Sandy Bridge or Core 2 moment in the years to come.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Dear client,</p>

<p>Setting aside the earlier challenges of using Zoom under ChromeOS and Linux, I have mostly been <strong>declining invitations to Zoom calls</strong> because of the terms they introduced from April 2023 in section 10 of their <a href="https://explore.zoom.us/en/terms/" rel="nofollow">Terms of Service</a> which seem to force every user, with no opt-out to the Terms available and with recourse only via arbitration, to agree that Zoom can:</p>
<ol><li>Train their AI on anything uploaded or created on Zoom (including transcripts and recordings) and use the consequent model for absolutely anything;</li>
<li>Have indefinite and ownership-equivalent rights to do so in the future and</li>
<li>Be indemnified by me if it turns out someone else owns the IP or has their rights infringed (for example to confidential materials everyone on the call is entitled to review).</li></ol>

<p>I prefer <a href="https://meet.jit.si/" rel="nofollow">Jitsi</a> instead; it has equivalent functionality, is platform independent, can be used without an account, is open source and can be self-hosted.</p>

<h2 id="details">Details</h2>

<p>In the <a href="https://explore.zoom.us/en/terms/" rel="nofollow">terms</a>, “data, content, files, documents, or other materials” that you use in a Zoom session (“Customer Input”), as well as recordings and transcripts, and any other glitter Zoom sprinkles over them, is called “Customer Content”.</p>

<p>10.4(ii) then sees you granting a broad license to Customer Content “for the purpose of product and service development, marketing, analytics, quality assurance, machine learning, artificial intelligence, training, testing, improvement of the Services, Software, or Zoom’s other products, services, and software, or any combination thereof”</p>

<p>If the stuff you shared belongs to someone else, 10.6 sees you agreeing “you are solely responsible for the Customer Content” and notably for getting consent from third parties and providing notices according to whatever laws happen to be applicable to the combination of people involved.</p>

<p>In addition to all this, in 10.6 you “represent and warrant that you have the right to upload Customer Input and for Zoom to provide, create, or make available any Customer Content to you, and that such use or provision by you, your End User, or Zoom does not violate or infringe any rights of any third party.” &nbsp;So according to 25(i) &amp; (iii) you are basically indemnifying them if they train their AI with someone else's IP you happen to have – for example, a client brief you are discussing internally, or a legal case you are working on under privilege.</p>

<p>There is no opt-out or scope control to use in the Terms for AI training. Zoom's COO <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37029700" rel="nofollow">says</a> the actual use of the AI features is opt-in, but that doesn't seem relevant as the Terms grant permission regardless and the Customer Content exists whether you use the AI features or not.</p>

<p>My non-lawyer read suggests this is an exceptionally risky thing for anyone to agree if they are in possession of IP or under NDA concerning someone else's secrets, and I will be avoiding Zoom (even if they revert the terms – can't take the chance on future changes like this).</p>

He is a survivor of bacterial meningitis, which caused him to have multiple amputation surgeries on his feet. He is a proud advocate for those with disabilities and addiction issues. He covers everything from the NFL and UFC to pizza-chucking and analysis of Tom Cruise's running ability.</ul></div></li></ul></div><p><b>RIGHT BEFORE HE HEAVED</b> the million-dollar shot, the one that would launch an era of sports contests and change his life forever, Don Calhoun took a long look at his shoes.</p><p>He was only out here standing on the floor of Chicago Stadium on April 14, 1993, 15 feet from <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/1035/michael-jordan" target="_blank">Michael Jordan</a> and the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/chi/chicago-bulls" target="_blank">Bulls</a>, because of his shoes. "Those won't scuff the court," an arena worker said as she signed Calhoun up for a $1 million, three-quarter-court contest shot that the Bulls had been running every night.</p><p>As he stared at his feet, waiting to be told it was his turn to take the shot, he was warned, "Whatever you do, don't step over the free throw line." Calhoun, a 23-year-old office supply salesman from the Chicago area, darted his eyes from his non-scuffing sneakers to the free throw line about 80 feet from the hoop he needed to make.</p><p>The impossibility of the shot was settling in. He wasn't going to be able to shoot it with both hands; he'd have to throw it like a quarterback. The Bulls had held the promotion 19 times that year already. Two people clunked the backboard. Another clanged the rim. The other 16 were air balls. Nobody came close. The best estimate of someone like Calhoun making that shot? Less than 1%.</p><p>But then, a calm came over him. He thought about his brother Clarence, who had told him five years earlier, just before he died, that Michael Jordan would soon be the best player in the NBA and the Bulls would be a dynasty. He thought about his bittersweet feelings toward the sport of basketball -- he loved the game and was good at it, but he never made his high school team.</p><p>It might sound ridiculous, but as Calhoun stood there and heard his name announced, he became sure -- <i>100% certain</i> -- that the shot was going to go in. The last thing he remembers is the steady hum of 18,600 people rising to cheer for him. As the Bulls huddled up nearby, Calhoun palmed the ball in one hand. The free throw line warning was bouncing around inside his head, and for a second, he felt his flow get disrupted.</p><p>But the flow came back as he stepped past the end line. He took one fast dribble, thought to himself, "This is for Clarence," and then threw a high-arching rocket.</p><p>As the ball sailed toward the hoop, Calhoun's eyes again turned toward his feet and he saw that he was <i>very</i> close to the free throw line -- but a few inches behind. Whew. When he looked up again, he had a moment of panic. He'd thrown it too far and too hard.</p><p>"It looked like it was going to hit the shot clock," he says.</p><p>But then the ball began to sink. It dropped, and dropped, and dropped, and... <i>swish</i>. Right through the net. Calhoun threw his arms toward the rafters, and the crowd let out one of those levels of cheers that aggravates the arena neighbors.</p><p>Then the real mayhem began.</p><p>The ensuing 30 seconds might be the most joyous footage of that Bulls team ever. Seriously, watch the most celebratory moments from "The Last Dance," and compare those with the clips you will inevitably see this April 14 on social media on the 30th anniversary of Calhoun's heave. <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3815/john-paxson" target="_blank">John Paxson</a> and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/919/scott-williams" target="_blank">Scott Williams</a> go wild. Some player just off-camera slaps Calhoun's ass over and over again, and even one of the game refs comes over, hits him on the back and hands him the ball from the shot. Phil Jackson stands there with an incredulous grin, looking like he just won the $1 million.</p><p>Suddenly, Calhoun found himself bumped and butt-slapped directly into the middle of the Bulls huddle, where the other players parted and there stood <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/663/scottie-pippen" target="_blank">Scottie Pippen</a> and Michael Jordan. Calhoun was the team's 13th man at that moment. Calhoun was in there for a good 10 seconds when he felt Jordan slap him on the back and lean into his ear.</p><p>"Great shot, kid," Jordan said.</p><p>Calhoun says he can still hear the way Jordan was yelling "Woo!" behind him the entire time. After the game, Michael Wilbon, then at The Washington Post, wrote, "Jordan, smiling in a child-like way I've never seen on the court, threw both arms around his neck and squeezed." As the celebration exploded around him, Calhoun felt as if his life was going to change. He was the toast of Chicago for the next 24 hours, with the shot going viral by 1993 standards, with newscasts and newspapers all showing the clip so much that Calhoun's shot is now referenced as the beginning of a boom in contests at sporting events. And best of all, Calhoun was about to become a millionaire.</p><p>Or so he thought.</p><hr><p><b>BY THE TIME DON CALHOUN</b> made his shot, in-game contests had begun to pop up here and there across the country. But Calhoun's make caused an eruption in popularity. Chris Hamman, VP at industry leader SCA Promotions, thinks "The Calhoun Shot," as it's become known in the business, might have doubled or even tripled the number of contests.</p><p>"These types of contests grew quite a bit, and a lot of NBA teams started doing similar contests," says Hamman, whose dad, Bob, founded SCA Promotions, which has been insuring sports contests since the mid-1980s. Chris compares Calhoun's make with the impact Chris Moneymaker had on poker in 2003 when he went from an $86 online qualifier to winning the World Series of Poker (and $2.5 million).</p><p>The contests took off afterward. They were the perfect way to keep 15,000-plus people engaged during TV timeouts and between quarters. They were wildly popular crowd-pleasers back then, and remain slam dunk #ViralContent in the social media era. SCA Promotions has insured billions of dollars of sports contests since the mid-1980s, paying out something like $250 million in winnings over the years, according to Bob Hamman. (SCA was not the insurer of the Calhoun Shot).</p><p>As the Hammans note, the perfect contest is like the most tempting carnival game: just feasible enough to make people think they can do it while actually being extremely difficult. Everybody at the Bulls game that night in 1993 probably had sunk a long shot or two at some point in their life. In reality, Jordan himself might not have made one if you gave him 100 tries. "With the shot that Don Calhoun made, you could have <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3975/stephen-curry" target="_blank">Steph Curry</a> out there and still make money," Chris Hamman says.</p><p>But, as was the case with Calhoun, people do win enough to keep contest dreams alive. SCA Promotions insures more than $100 million in sports contests every year, and the Hammans love telling stories of paying off winners ... because the vast majority of holes-in-one and half-court shots never happen. It's a little like when sportsbooks leak out those betting slips of the fan who hit a 12-team parlay that cost $40 and pays out $250,000. The good news fuels the delusion of it happening to you.</p><p>One of the Hammans' favorite winners was a <a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/ari/arizona-diamondbacks" target="_blank">Diamondbacks</a> fan, Gylene Hoyle, who won a 1999 radio contest where she had to pick one Arizona player and an inning. If that player hit a home run in that exact inning during a specific game, she'd win $1 million.</p><p>Seems doable, right? The math is actually obscene. She picked <a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/player/_/id/1823/jay-bell" target="_blank">Jay Bell</a>, who was in the middle of a monster year (38 home runs and 112 RBIs). She had about a 1-in-2,916 chance. And yet, Bell came to the plate in the sixth inning with the bases loaded. He fouled off two straight two-strike pitches, then hit a home run on a pitch that could have been ball four. Afterward, he acknowledged that he knew about the contest and swung hoping to get someone $1 million. "That one stung," Bob Hamman says.</p><p>The math on insuring high-stakes contests generally works the same way. Brokers come up with a likelihood that a random contestant could win -- the Hammans say a three-quarter-court shot is less than 1%, for example -- and divide it into the prize amount, then charge about twice that to insure it. For a $1 million contest with a 1% success rate, that means it'd cost the team $20,000 every time they run it.</p><p>Once the details are ironed out, insurance companies come up with all the fine print. Contestants usually must be randomly selected from the crowd. If it's one shot, there's no warmup toss or second attempt. If it's three makes in 30 seconds, three makes in 30.1 seconds is close but no money. For something like a hockey shot that must go through a tiny plywood cutout and into a goal, the shot has to be entirely through. Not mostly through. Not on the line. <i>Entirely</i> through.</p><p>Insurance companies are unforgiving with teams that don't explain the rules right, and it's not unusual for franchises to end up paying out the contest themselves if there are any issues. The PR hit of stiffing a middle school geometry teacher out of $25,000 generally isn't worth it.</p><p>But lawsuits and disagreements happen, and that's what almost happened to Don Calhoun. One key stipulation in most insurance policies is that the contestant can't have played an "organized" version of the sport in question for a certain time period before the contest -- usually, five years.</p><p>Calhoun grew up in Chicago playing hoops on the playground with Clarence. Both had trouble making it onto junior high and varsity teams despite what seemed to be a worthy skill set. They were tough guards who loved dogging opposing ball handlers on defense. But they also played a brand of streetball that didn't always translate well to high school hoops.</p><p>They certainly had talent, though. Clarence graduated and played at a junior college for his freshman year, then transferred to <a href="https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/305/depaul-blue-demons" target="_blank">DePaul</a> to walk onto the basketball team as a sophomore. Don, then a senior in high school, drew inspiration from Clarence's unwillingness to quit basketball despite a high school career that didn't pan out -- he, too, planned to go to a small school to play hoops before transferring to a bigger school.</p><p>But one weekend, Clarence was on his way home from school to hang out with his family for a few days when the Calhouns got a dreaded phone call. He had gotten tired on the drive home, pulled over to rest, and been struck and killed by another car. He was 20.</p><p>Don was devastated. He didn't graduate that spring on time as he grieved. But he went back to school in the fall and got his diploma. He slowly landed in a headspace where he wanted to use his brother's memory as fuel. He bounced around at two community colleges and walked on with both basketball teams. One newspaper account from the time says he was 3-for-12 shooting in 11 career games.</p><p>But Don eventually walked away from school and from any formal basketball. He found out his longtime girlfriend was pregnant, so he got a job as an office supply salesman. Binders, notebooks, day planners, you name it, Don Calhoun was the guy to talk to. He was making a decent living, and he eventually had a son. The little boy's name? Clarence Calhoun II.</p><p>When Clarence was 3, Don hugged him and told him to watch the Bulls game that night because Dad might be on TV. Clarence remembers his mom letting him stay up, although he's not sure he saw the actual shot. He just recalls yelling and pointing at the screen as he watched his dad leap up and down with Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls. Then he went to bed.</p><p>Calhoun says that he marked on the forms that he had played some college basketball three years earlier and that the contest people shrugged about it. The insurance company disagreed, and the weekend after he had won, local news media began to report that Calhoun might not be getting the money. That prompted the Bulls to hold a news conference, where Calhoun sat beside Jerry Reinsdorf and several contest sponsors.</p><p>"It is unclear at this time whether the company that insured the event will pay on the policy," a joint statement read. "However, regardless of its decision, [restaurant group] Lettuce Entertain You, Coca-Cola (Foundation) and the Chicago Bulls will honor the $1 million award and ensure that this event has a happy ending."</p><p>Calhoun left that day knowing that the win was, in fact, going to be a win. He would immediately receive his first of 20 annual $50,000 payments. In the coming weeks, he appeared on "The Tonight Show with Jay Leno" and got a cup of coffee as a member of the Harlem Globetrotters. He was, unbelievably, the unofficial mayor of Chicago for a brief period. When Wilbon called Calhoun's company for his story, someone answered by saying, "Reliable Office Superstore. This is the home of one-shot Don Calhoun, the million-dollar man."</p><p>He never got many details about how the sponsors and insurance company worked it out. He just took yes as an answer. It wasn't until a few weeks later that he found out that he might have needed a key assist from a secret source: Michael Jordan himself.</p><hr><p><b>AFTER CALHOUN</b> made the shot, he was asked to stay on the floor and do an endless string of TV hits and print interviews. As he bounced from camera setup to camera setup near the Chicago locker room, Bulls players kept leaving and spotting him on their way out. Almost every player came over, said congratulations and signed his basketball. "It took me three years to make a million dollars, and it took him five seconds," <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/279/horace-grant" target="_blank">Horace Grant</a> joked afterward.</p><p>Calhoun got signatures from Grant, Scottie Pippen, John Paxson and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/23" target="_blank">B.J. Armstrong</a>, plus two Heat players who swung by, Rony Seikaly and Steve Smith. And then, as he got ready to do another live hit, Calhoun saw Jordan and a Bulls staffer come out and stand nearby. Calhoun made eye contact with Jordan, who smiled back at him and was clearly there waiting to say hello to him. Calhoun wanted to run over and ditch whatever TV interview he was about to do, but producers kept telling him they were about to go live any second now.</p><p>When the lights went on, Calhoun did the best interview he could as he watched in dismay what was happening on the other side of the camera. Jordan said something to the Bulls staffer and left. Calhoun wasn't going to meet MJ, after all, and it crushed him. The Bulls worker said he could leave the ball behind and they'd try to get Jordan to sign it.</p><p>But Calhoun had other plans. He didn't want to leave the building without that ball, so he took it. He thought there was a chance he might run into Jordan somewhere down the road, then he could get an autograph.</p><p>Over the next few days, news broke all over the country that Calhoun's winnings seemed to be in jeopardy. Calhoun clung to that ball, and it provided him hope. He had made the shot. The crowd had gone completely wild. The Bulls had pulled him into their huddle. He had left with the ball. That was all real, and he would have it forever. The $1 million? He sure hoped it was coming his way. But he also felt an odd peace about the money. The experience alone certainly wouldn't pay for Clarence's school clothes. But it wasn't nothing, either. It was priceless.</p><p>As reports swirled, fan outrage was palpable in Chicago, which created enough heat on the franchise to figure out some way to pay the local office supply salesman his damn money. That led to the news conference and the first $50,000 check.</p><p>But what to do about his beloved basketball? The next school year, he had heard from a friend that Jordan always attended one of his kid's home games at a specific school in the area. So he showed up that night -- with his ball and two magazines -- and tried to walk up to Jordan. The Bulls star had his own section away from the crowd, complete with security that kept people from doing exactly what Calhoun was trying to do.</p><p>Calhoun was stopped on his approach by a Jordan security guy, who said Jordan had a firm policy of no autographs at his kids' events. Calhoun explained who he was and that Jordan had seemed to really want to meet him back in April. The security guy wouldn't budge. "No autographs at his kids' stuff," the guy repeated.</p><p>But Calhoun had a funny feeling that he shouldn't give up. He asked the security to <i>pretty-pretty-pretty please</i> tell Jordan that the guy who made The Calhoun Shot had come to the game hoping for his signature. The security guy shook his head. Calhoun was even willing to just hand the guy the ball to take to Jordan. No luck.</p><p>"Michael doesn't do anything when he's at one of his kid's games," Calhoun was told.</p><p>An unlikely thing happened near the end of the game, though. The security guard came to Calhoun in the stands and told him he could walk with Jordan to his car after the game. So Calhoun got his ball and Sharpie ready, then met up with the Jordan crew as he left the high school.</p><p>The first thing out of Jordan's mouth? "Did you get your money?" Jordan asked.</p><p>Calhoun said yes, and Jordan told him something that caught him off guard. "We made them give it to you," Jordan said. "We were upset that they were trying to not pay you."</p><p>Calhoun was stunned. He had heard rumors that the Bulls players were agitated at the thought of him getting stiffed. But this was confirmation that Michael Jordan himself helped make him a millionaire. (Jordan declined an interview request for this story; the Bulls also passed on participating.)</p><p>As they got to a set of doors, Calhoun knew Jordan's car was waiting for him on the other side. He asked whether Jordan would sign his ball, and MJ said no, that he had to stick to his principle of no autographs at his kids' stuff. "Bring it down to my steakhouse and drop it off, then I'll sign it," he said.</p><p>Calhoun waved goodbye that night and thanked Jordan once more for advocating on his behalf. But as he left later, he felt a pang as he considered just pulling up to Jordan's restaurant, dropping off the ball and hoping for the best.</p><p>The ball had grown to mean so much to him. It wasn't the signatures, or that he thought the ball might be worth something like $20,000. Its actual worth was beyond what someone could pay. It represented the agony of losing Clarence and trying to carry his brother's message with his own son. It represented the end of the bitter, unfulfilled taste that "organized" basketball had left in his mouth. It represented closing that chapter of his life when he had to fight and claw to pay every bill for his family, opening up 20 years where he knew he had a financial backstop each year.</p><p>Was he really going to hand the ball to some random steakhouse assistant manager and cross his fingers, hoping he'd see it again?</p><p>The answer was... yes, he was going to do exactly that. He felt as if Jordan's signature was too important as the coda to the story of the ball. So he drove over there one day and implored the person he handed it to for help, saying that this ball meant so much to him, that MJ's signature was the last missing component of an artifact from the most important moment of his life.</p><p>It must have worked. A few weeks later, he got a call to pick up the ball. "Michael signed it, and he wishes you well," Calhoun was told.</p><p>The ball became a family heirloom over the next three decades. But not in the way you'd expect. Calhoun never locked it up in a vault or even put it in a protective case in the house. He left it in the basement of his house, and Clarence and Calhoun's other three kids would dribble it and throw it around. He wanted his kids to be able to touch and feel something that had altered the trajectory of their family. "I'll always keep it for you," Don told Clarence.</p><p>For the next 20 years, Calhoun would get a check for $50,000 every year. Of that money, he'd have to set aside around $12,000 for taxes. He kept his office sales job for a few more years, and the other $38,000 (about $79,000 in 2023 dollars) was a very nice supplemental living. But, as Calhoun says, it was more like a bump up within the middle class. "In reality, you're not rich," he says. "You're not a millionaire."</p><p>Maybe he didn't have generational wealth. But he was about to experience a generational breakthrough.</p><hr><p><b>AS THE 30th ANNIVERSARY</b> of the shot approaches, Calhoun takes a few weeks to decide whether he will talk about the shot, the money or any of it. He hasn't done many interviews over the years. Eventually, he agreed to one but asked that his current location and occupation be left out of the story. Let's say he's living within a few hours of Chicago in the Midwest, and he works the second shift at a solid job.</p><p>He's not hesitant because he's a particularly shy person -- once he gets rolling on the phone, he's funny and unafraid to argue, and he comes off as very open and honest as he talks. Toward the end of an hourlong interview, he asks, "How can I get to the Hall of Fame?"</p><p>When the answer is a surprised chuckle, he says, "Don't you laugh. I want to be in the Hall of Fame. I think I deserve it."</p><p>He seems to be goofing around, but Calhoun changes lanes easily between being confident and reserved. He talks about the shot like he knew it was going in the entire time, yet it never sounds particularly braggy. He seems as if he had his 15 minutes and is content with that ... but also thinks it'd be nice to have a small shrine to it.</p><p>Calhoun is 53 now. He catches the video only every few years, when somebody will show him a tweet or video link to a clip that you will most likely see every April 14 for the rest of eternity.</p><p>Calhoun is neither rich nor poor, at least in the traditional sense of the word. He does, however, feel wealthy when he talks about his four kids. The Calhoun Shot gave them all a better life. His youngest, Terrelle, is 20 and lives in Austin, Texas. Naomi, 22, is in nursing school. Gabriela, 28, is a teacher. And Clarence II, 33, is living out something beyond his own wildest dreams -- and his dad's.</p><p>Don Calhoun's oldest son became a good prep basketball player at East Aurora High School and graduated in 2008. With five years of $50,000 checks left, Don encouraged Clarence to finish the job he and his brother had started years earlier: graduating from college. Clarence loved that idea. What a cool way to pay tribute to the uncle he never met but was named after. The problem was, he still didn't know what he wanted to be when he grew up.</p><p>For the first few years after high school, he bounced between community colleges before getting into Wiley College, an HBCU in Marshall, Texas. He had developed an interest in the human body, especially biology. But college was no joke. Clarence Calhoun II limped to a 1.6 GPA in his first semester. It wasn't that he couldn't handle the coursework or the social life or the amount of work it took. It was the totality of doing all of those things all at once. He didn't know a single person who had experience at this level of education. He was a rookie, surrounded by rookies.</p><p>That's when he met a Ukrainian physician named Dr. Valentyn Siniak. Siniak was at Wiley teaching while he took mandatory tests to begin practicing medicine in the U.S. Calhoun was blown away by the level of support Siniak provided. Calhoun isn't sure exactly what Siniak saw in him, but he saw something.</p><p>In emails to Calhoun, Siniak began calling him "Dr. Clarence Calhoun." When Calhoun asked him for guidance on how he could get his grades up, Siniak made him laugh out loud. "I think you should start tutoring other students," Siniak said.</p><p>"Tutoring?" Calhoun said. "I'm struggling to learn everything myself. How can I teach others?" Siniak thought this would give Calhoun an extra nudge to learn the material and boost his own command.</p><p>Siniak was <i>exactly</i> right. So right, in fact, that Calhoun sighs and shakes his head on a Zoom describing this section of his life. He still can't fathom the way Siniak manifested belief into Calhoun's life. His grades soared, and he liked working with other students. He had to work his ass off to get there -- at one point, campus security officers would close up the science building for the night, knowing Calhoun was still in there. He'd study most of the night, inflate a mattress for a few hours and wake up the next day ready to do it again. "I found out I was smarter than I thought I was," Calhoun says now.</p><p>And so in 2013, Calhoun graduated from college just as his dad's $50,000 annual checks ended. He was the first in his family to get a college degree, and he battled and scrapped every day to get it.</p><p>He also had found out that his girlfriend was pregnant and that they were having a boy. When he told Don, he said, "Know what we're going to name him, Dad?"</p><p>Don began to think about it for a second ... and then it hit him. He didn't say a word, and his son didn't either. They laughed, hugged and celebrated the upcoming birth of Clarence Calhoun III.</p><p>Clarence Calhoun II started to chart a course for the next phase of his life, which had come into focus for him. "I want to be a doctor," he told his dad, and he began to try to get into medical school. He worked jobs at Jiffy Lube, a toxicology lab and other places before he finally passed his labs and got accepted. This was happening. Not only was a Calhoun going to earn his degree but he felt as if he might actually become the Dr. Clarence Calhoun his instructor, Dr. Siniak, had predicted in his emails.</p><p>That's why it breaks the younger Calhoun's heart to tell this next part of the story. Siniak didn't get to see Calhoun get his degree. In January 2013, Siniak was struck and killed while riding a motorcycle in Texas. "Having him believe in me helped me believe in myself," Calhoun says. "My biggest downfall that was keeping me from excelling was my confidence. I just didn't think I could. I didn't have anybody around me who had done it."</p><p>Over the next eight years, he passed his boards and did his residency, and an envelope arrived in May 2021 that he couldn't wait to open. The piece of paper inside made it official: He was now Dr. Clarence Calhoun.</p><p>He went to his dad's house to show him in person, and they had a long embrace. Don couldn't stop smiling. After a minute, he walked out of the room and came back holding two things he was giving to his son.</p><p>One was the shoes he had worn during The Calhoun Shot. Clarence noticed they had a signature on them. They were autographed by ... none other than Don Calhoun, which makes Clarence laugh to this day when he holds them up. His dad can be a goofball -- an inspiring goofball. "He drops spiritual motivation all the time, and that's always needed," Clarence says. "In moments when it feels like life is too difficult, he helps you figure out how you can do it."</p><p>For the second item, Don Calhoun didn't hand it to him. He reared back and threw a push pass at his son's chest.</p><p>"Here, I want you to have this," and he chucked an old basketball at his son. Clarence Calhoun II hadn't seen the ball from The Calhoun Shot in 10-15 years, and now it was going to live with him and his son. The two older Calhouns, Don and Clarence, hugged once more. And as Dr. Clarence Calhoun left that day, with a basketball under one arm and some old shoes under the other, his whole life felt like sinking a less than 1% three-quarter-court shot.</p>

I can give a feedback on our collaboration so far:<p>1) Code quality is good, I would compare it to a very good junior engineer (I suspect some senior engineers are reviewing the code before shipping it!). We are reviewing all PRs and it usually takes 1 or 2 round of feedbacks before merge.</p><p>2) Gitstart developers are very reactive on pull-requests, their response time is not a bottleneck</p><p>3) You will need to be very accurate about your features. I think Gitstart direclty makes sense for open-source projects as this is part of the culture to discuss everything on issues, to share resources (figmas, specs, technical vision). If your company already has a culture of documenting most of the knowledge async, this should be a good fit.

We run an open source project with a very long backlog and I came across Gitstart as I was looking for ways to accelerate development. We started working with them recently and overall I'm very happy with the service. At first the quality of PRs wasn't great, but it is still better than the average open source contribution, and it's improving everyday as they gain knowledge of our codebase and expectations.
As a remote team that is just starting a new project, it would have been hard for us to onboard and train a junior developer today. Using Gitstart fills a gap for tasks that we can easily delegate, typically something that's already done in a similar way in the code base. That way our team can focus on more challenging problems.<p>(Note: I was not asked to post this)

The only advantage I see to this sort of arrangement on the hiring end compared to regular old long-contract outsourcing is that I don't have to pay for work I don't end up using, but that circles me right back to the "exploitative" part.

We do help to set that up if customers sign up on the Team or Enterprise plan as a first sprint to add all these guardrails in place.</p><p>I agree that junior devs today are heavily exploited by existing freelance and outsourcing platforms where it's a race to the cheapest contractor in the market. For teams who want to freelance, we are not a good fit (and most likely more expensive). Where we do shine is an in-house team that does not have the bandwidth to hand-hold each external contractor one by one to become productive.

When you submit a PR, submit a process with it (in a readme of some sort) with instructions on how the receiving devs should proceed with the PR. If they are not happy with it, maybe they can just say "not happy with it" and you take on yourself to figure out why. That sort of instructions. The last thing you want is them complaining they spend more time on it than simply coding it.</p><p>Im pretty sure the management of the human interface here is key because the only way this can work is if you've got off-the-charts feedbacks.

Also you can't just rename this db column, let me explain our db replication strategy (which you can't touch or observe since no way would a non-employee have any of our AWS access, even for dev). oh and Jim (haha good ole jim, he wrote like 40% of the code and then got fired after 2 years because he told the CTO to go fuck himself) wrote that code in a rush in the before times so it's creaky, try not to ever touch or look at it, so work around it in the app code even if you might otherwise want to change it" and so on and so on.</p><p>(I also find learning all this stuff - the NIH systems, the stack, who the Jim is this time around and what code he wrote, etc - is like 85% of the part of spinning up at a new company and it takes like 6 months of fireside campfire stories to pick up enough of the lore)</p><p>It sounds like a shop like this would basically mean devs are eternally in that "doesn't know about Jim's code yet" stage.

Everyone has been Jim at-least once before.<p>You are right, it will never replace good old Jim (or a backend dev). What it can do instead is to accelerate the devs. What if Jim created tickets to add a GitHub action to run linting on every PR, update and refactor existing code based on a new formatting rule, add more unit test cases? Basically utilize GitStart as a way to accelerate on tickets that may not be worth his time, but accelerate everyone else.</p><p>On a go to market comment, we are laser focused first to target frontend teams, particularly where as long as you have API docs (Swagger, GraphQL), and a staging environment (or we help create one) devs can go a long way without shared context.

When GitStart devs create PRs on the platform, GitSlice syncs them upstream while pulling back CI/CD checks and review comments. This enables our devs to contribute with limited codebase access.</p><p>Is this an internal tool or something you also make (or plan to make) available? We have this problem too at Ritza (a technical writing agency), where often our customers have a mono-repo with a docs/ subfolder that we need access too. Currently we solve this with some custom bash scripts and cron to sync just a subfolder to an internal copy, but is far from perfect and still involves some manual cherry-picking.

Here in the UK it is illegal to hire an apprentice without at least paying them a minimum wage. The reason is that before the change, the apprenticeships were snapped up by people from wealthy background who could afford to work for "experience" or "exposure". This created a bubble, where at certain jobs you wouldn't see anyone from disadvantaged background working there, because those people had to take on jobs that weren't aligned with their interests, simply because they were poor and couldn't afford an apprenticeship.
Now, the minimum wage thing is still not ideal, because in certain areas that's not enough, especially where you have a large family to support, but it is better than nothing.

Is that cheating?). However!</p><p>First tiny backstory: Around 5 years ago I had a Clevo shitbox laptop for gaming (all I could afford then). It was loud and overheated (obviously). It was back in the "desktop replacement" days when there was a weird trend craze of putting desktop GPUs and CPUs into huge laptops, at the peril of...everyone?</p><p>So after a few months of having it, I decided to integrate an AIO water cooler "onto" (into?) it.</p><p>From a Youtube videos I learned the ins-and-outs of molex, lapping copper (how to not breath in ultra toxic metal dust was a welcome bonus), 12V and 24V switching power supplies, soldering, wire stripping, etc., then I just stuck the AIO cooler on with thermal adhesive, hooked it all up with a nice rocker switch and electric wizbangs, and I had a cute little switchable AIO cooler for my gaming laptop.</p><p>It looked gross, but actually resulted in a ~10% gaming perf boost and made it a lot more quiet (the AIO was taking a tonne of heat from the CPU where most of the heat and gaming bottlenecks came from.</p><p>It really did look hilarious. It was a fun story when guests came round for food/drinks/whatever; I would often get asked about what the heck it even is, as it just looked like some kid hot-glue-gunned a bunch of random wires, fans, and boxes to the back and under-side of a laptop.

Two years ago our basement flooded a week after we bought the house. I ended up tearing out the now-saturated carpet and put in vinyl plank flooring. Mainly straight forward but requires planning and at some points tricky sawing. It's cool when people come in and un-prompted say "wow that's a great floor you have here"</p><p>2. Maybe 4 years ago, I completely disassembled and repaired a through-wall heating and cooling unit in our NYC apartment because it wasn't producing a lot of air. Previously, repairmen came out and said it was working as normal and just wasn't meant to produce more air. This taught me a lot about electronics, HVAC, testing, and shopping at vendor-supply stores. People are shocked that a civilian was able to do this repair.</p><p>EDIT: I'll add one more:</p><p>3. Replacing the screen on my Pixel 6 Pro. It fell out of my pocket while biking, and although it wouldn't have been the end of the world to just get a replacement, I thought it would be fun to try and repair. I normally stayed away from stuff like that because I didn't want to deal with removing/applying adhesives but it was really not a big dea.

I suspect repair-folks don't do a lot of returns. EG - if they buy a capacitor and then it's not what was wrong, they end up keeping it for another job whereas I retired it. Also, when I bought the motor that was the manufacturer specified replacement, it wasn't a perfect match for some other part of the unit. I had to bike back to the store and the guy gave me some bushings (which solved the issue) but real repair people would probably know that the shaft thickness changed on that motor and carry some bushings around anyway.</p><p>So yeah they were fine to do business with me but they normally deal with large-size orders probably, so my stuff was "cute" but most certainly not a priority for them.

I went with a Vans[2] which are very popular kits with a huge volunteer support/help community online and offline. They list kit prices on their web site, but they are <i>exclusive</i> of engine, propeller and avionics, which can be significant. Fortunately, since it takes a looong time to build, these costs can be spread out over many years to make it manageable. I got my pilot certificate 20 years ago when it wasn't as expensive as today.

This is a very old method that tends to survive long periods because it is making a material/mineral change in the composite medium in a way that embeds pigments into plaster - making it durable to degradation in ways that other methods aren't.</p><p>I take this further by blending the pigment into water and then adding lime plaster so that the plaster itself is pigmented, and then you work with the pigmented plaster much like you would work with oil on canvas. I make my own wooden frame "canvases" by hand and have had to deal with warping and cracking.</p><p>The challenges are numerous and there's nobody to follow or ask for help or advice because as far as I'm aware nobody has developed a practice for this. In many cases I've had to make my own pigment (For example I ground up Kingsford Charcoal for black pigment on "Untitled 7" which gave it more of a concrete texture)</p><p>The biggest challenge however is with pigments - not only are they hard to make and expensive to buy - but when mixing with lime plaster they get IMMEDIATELY washed out so that bright and bold colors are extremely hard to make.</p><p>I am currently working on my latest piece and this thread made me upload my latest progress to show: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CvptIU1urzD/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.instagram.com/p/CvptIU1urzD/</a></p><p>In order to get the depth of pigment I want I am experimenting with soaking my unset plaster with tons of pigmented water. So far it's working!</p><p>My next set of experiments is to figure out a new frame material that will not decompose faster than the plaster. My fear is that in a 100 years the wood will have degraded and that will cause the whole thing to fall apart, so I need to figure out how to get the plaster to adhere to stone somehow.</p><p>[1] <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kemendoart/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.instagram.com/kemendoart/</a>

I personally patented, designed, built, and deployed a novel ultrasonic inspection device that encoded position/orientation using IR (Just like motion capture in movies).

Fast deployment was important to avoid radiation and guaranteing coverage was important for safety. Ended up costing significantly less than automated scanning using a robotic system.<p>My absolute favorite was using the data to project a 3d model of the interior of the welds. Had to learn quaternions which was nearly the death of me, but I'm just glad it worked.

The system used traditional manual scanning system with a VGA capture card on the back. I synced that with an off the shelf IR capture system and was able to record the ultrasonic scan into a video file using opencv. I would also record a USB cam at the same time as a sanity check. I could generate point clouds of data by reading the video file and the synced position data to project where the ultrasound was going and the linear response of the scanner. Was a ton of fun to develop and it was nice that I pretty much only had myself to blame when things went wrong. I also had to write the procedure for operation in case someone else had to use it.

That's now my favourite guitar to play. Pretty low action with zero buzz, pickups can give me everything from full dynamics and great range, to easily distortable power solos.</p><p>I'm now in the process of building a new guitar with a 3D printed body.

Running the heat off 1500W was stupidly inefficient, so I went out and acquired one of those tankless propane-powered hot water heaters and rigged it to a commercial RV water pump and a 20# propane tank to circulate water into the hot tub that way. It heated the tub up from ~50* faucet to 104* hot in about 3 hours, instead of closer to 30 on 120V power.<p>The other thing I built is more of a lifehack living with sleep apnea. My CPAP's humidifier failed, and instead of replacing it with another proprietary humidifier, I bought an external CPAP humidifier[1] and then realized I could, with some clever plumbing, rig up a water pump from an external gallon jug of water to automatically re-fill my humidifier in the morning at the push (and hold) of a button. I took an oxygen-insertion tee, 12v pump, and some tubing and a check valve and attached the pump to the oxygen line on one of the inlets of the humidifier chamber. When you push the button, water flows through, through the check valve, and immediately down into the chamber.</p><p>Here's a snapshot of an early test: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/vund22E.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://i.imgur.com/vund22E.png</a></p><p>It's been tweaked a little bit since then but it's my FAVORITE thing on my nightstand now. (And yes - that is a recalled DreamStation 1 - I personally opened it and repaired the defect foam myself. I don't trust the replacement device they sent me any farther than harvesting the motor from it when my old machine fails.)</p><p>[1] <a href="https://www.fphcare.com/us/homecare/sleep-apnea/cpap-devices/hc150/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.fphcare.com/us/homecare/sleep-apnea/cpap-devices...</a>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The latest version of Intel Arc GPU Graphics Software introduced an interesting change that isn't reflected in the Release Notes. The installer of the 101.4578 beta drivers add a "Compute Improvement Program" (CIP) component as part of the "typical" setup option that is enabled by default. Under the "custom" installer option that you have to activate manually, you get to select which components to install. The Compute Improvement Program can be unchecked here, to ensure data collection is disabled. The benignly named CIP is a data collection component that tracks your PC usage and performance in the background (not just that of the GPU), so Intel can use the data to improve its future products. Intel created a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/topics/idsa-cip.html" target="_blank">dedicated webpage</a> that spells out what CIP is, and what its scope of data collection is; where is says that CIP "does not collect your name, email address, phone number, sensitive personal information, or physical location (except for country)."</p><p>

Intel CIP is functionally similar to the Telemetry component of the GeForce Software. NVIDIA's Telemetry is installed and enabled by default along with your GeForce graphics drivers, and you cannot opt out from it, as it does not even figure in the "custom" installer options. AMD handles its version of CIP and Telemetry in arguably the most transparent manner. The installer of AMD Software Adrenalin presents the option to prevent its data-collection tool from being enabled at the completion of driver installation, regardless of whether you've chosen the "typical," "driver only," or "custom" install options. There's an entire page of the installer dedicated to this, you see a large checkbox about data-collection that's checked by default, but which you can uncheck, and complete installation.</p><p><a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/img/Vd7Bo9PJ56UUwPyK.jpg" target="_blank" data-width="844" data-height="645" data-fancybox="g312122"><img src="https://tpucdn.com/img/Vd7Bo9PJ56UUwPyK_thm.jpg" width="170" height="130" alt=""></a> <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/img/Ut3YdxBy6bssIz4e.jpg" target="_blank" data-width="1645" data-height="1000" data-fancybox="g312122"><img src="https://tpucdn.com/img/Ut3YdxBy6bssIz4e_thm.jpg" width="214" height="130" alt=""></a></p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/08/07/tactics-for-writing-in-public/">https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/08/07/tactics-for-writing-in-public/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37033403">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
     

<p>Someone recently asked me – “how do you deal with writing in public? People on
the internet are such assholes!”</p>

<p>I’ve often heard the advice “don’t read the comments”, but actually I’ve
learned a huge amount from reading internet comments on my posts from strangers
over the years, even if sometimes people are jerks. So I want to explain some
tactics I use to try to make the comments on my posts more informative and
useful to me, and to try to minimize the number of annoying comments I get.</p>

<h3 id="talk-about-facts">talk about facts</h3>

<p>On here I mostly talk about facts – either facts about computers, or stories
about my experiences using computers.</p>

<p>For example <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2016/03/16/tcpdump-is-amazing/">this post</a> about tcpdump contains some basic facts about how to use tcpdump,
as well as an example of how I’ve used it in the past.</p>

<p>Talking about facts means I get a lot of fact-based comments like:</p>

<ul>
<li>people sharing their own similar (or different) experiences (“I use tcpdump a lot to look at our RTP sequence numbers”)</li>
<li>pointers to other resources (“the documentation from F5 about tcpdump is great”)</li>
<li>other interesting related facts I didn’t mention (“you can use tcpdump -X
too”, “netsh on windows is great”, “you can use <code>sudo tcpdump -s 0 -A
'tcp[((tcp[12:1] &amp; 0xf0) &gt;&gt; 2):4] = 0x47455420'</code> to filter for HTTP GET requests)</li>
<li>potential problems or gotchas (“be careful about running tcpdump as root, try just setting the required capabilities instead”)</li>
<li>questions (“Is there a way to place the BPF filter after IP packet reassembly?” or “what’s the advantage of tcpdump over wireshark?”)</li>
<li>mistakes I made</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, I’d say that people’s comments about facts tend to stay pretty
normal. The main kinds of negative comments I get about facts are:</p>

<ul>
<li>occasionally people get a little rude about facts I didn’t mention (“Didn’t
use -n in any of the examples…please…“). I think I didn’t mention <code>-n</code> in
that post because at the time I didn’t know why the <code>-n</code> flag was useful
(it’s useful because it turns off this annoying reverse DNS lookup that
tcpdump does by default so you can see the IP addresses).</li>
<li>people are also sometimes weird about mistakes. I mostly try to head this off
by trying to be self-aware about my knowledge level on a topic, and saying
“I’m not sure…” when I’m not sure about something.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="stories-are-great">stories are great</h3>

<p>I think stories encourage pretty good discussion. For example, <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2015/11/21/why-you-should-understand-a-little-about-tcp/">why you should understand (a little) about TCP</a>
is a story about a time it was important for me to understand how TCP worked.</p>

<p>When I share stories about problems I solved, the comments really help me
understand how what I learned fits into a bigger context. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>is this a common problem? people will often comment saying “this happened to me too!”</li>
<li>what are other common related problems that come up?</li>
<li>are there other possible solutions I didn’t consider?</li>
</ul>

<p>Also I think these kinds of stories are incredibly important – that post
describes a bug that was VERY hard for me to solve, and the only reason I was
able to figure it out in the first place was that I read <a href="https://gocardless.com/blog/in-search-of-performance-how-we-shaved-200ms-off-every-post-request/">this blog post</a>.</p>

<h3 id="ask-technical-questions">ask technical questions</h3>

<p>Often in my blog posts I ask technical questions that I don’t know the answer
to (or just mention “I don’t know X…”). This helps people focus their
replies a little bit – an obvious comment to make is to provide an answer to
the question, or explain the thing I didn’t know!</p>

<p>This is fun because it feels like a guaranteed way to get value out of people’s
comments – people LOVE answering questions, and so they get to look smart, and
I get the answer to a question I have! Everyone wins!</p>

<h3 id="fix-mistakes">fix mistakes</h3>

<p>I make a lot of mistakes in my blog posts, because I write about a lot of
things that are on the edge of my knowledge. When people point out mistakes, I
often edit the blog post to fix it.</p>

<p>Usually I’ll stay near a computer for a few hours after I post a blog post so
that I can fix mistakes quickly as they come up.</p>

<p>Some people are very careful to list every single error they made in their blog
posts (“errata: the post previously said X which was wrong, I have corrected it
to say Y”). Personally I make mistakes constantly and I don’t have time for
that so I just edit the post to fix the mistakes.</p>

<h3 id="ask-for-examples-experiences-not-opinions">ask for examples/experiences, not opinions</h3>

<p>A lot of the time when I post a blog post, people on Twitter/Mastodon will
reply with various opinions they have about the thing. For example, someone
recently replied to a blog post about DNS saying that they love using zone
files and dislike web interfaces for managing DNS records. That’s not an
opinion I share, so I asked them why.</p>

<p>They explained that there are some DNS record types (specifically <code>TLSA</code>) that they find
often aren’t supported in web interfaces. I didn’t know that people used <code>TLSA</code>
records, so I learned something! Cool!</p>

<p>I’ve found that asking people to share their <strong>experiences</strong> (“I wanted to use
X DNS record type and I couldn’t”) instead of their <strong>opinions</strong>  (“DNS web
admin interfaces are bad”) leads to a lot of useful information and
discussion. I’ve learned a lot from it over the years, and written a lot of
tweets like “which DNS record types have you needed?” to try to extract more
information about people’s experiences.</p>

<p>I try to model the same behaviour in my own work when I can – if I have an
opinion, I’ll try to explain the experiences I’ve had with computers that
caused me to have that opinion.</p>

<h3 id="start-with-a-little-context">start with a little context</h3>

<p>I think internet strangers are more likely to reply in a weird way when they
have no idea who you are or why you’re writing this thing. It’s easy to make
incorrect assumptions! So often I’ll mention a little context about why I’m
writing this particular blog post.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A little while ago I started using a Mac, and one of my biggest frustrations
with it is that often I need to run Linux-specific software.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’ve started to run a few more servers recently (nginx playground, mess with
dns, dns lookup), so I’ve been thinking about monitoring.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Last night, I needed to scan some documents for some bureaucratic reasons.
I’d never used a scanner on Linux before and I was worried it would take hours
to figure out…</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="avoid-causing-boring-conversations">avoid causing boring conversations</h3>

<p>There are some kinds of programming conversations that I find extremely boring
(like “should people learn vim?” or “is functional programming better than
imperative programming?“). So I generally try to avoid writing blog posts that
I think will result in a conversation/comment thread that I find annoying or
boring.</p>

<p>For example, I wouldn’t write about my opinions about functional programming: I
don’t really have anything interesting to say about it and I think it would
lead to a conversation that I’m not interested in having.</p>

<p>I don’t always succeed at this of course (it’s impossible to predict what
people are going to want to comment about!), but I try to avoid the most
obvious flamebait triggers I’ve seen in the past.</p>

<p>There are a bunch of “flamebait” triggers that can set people off on a
conversation that I find boring: cryptocurrency, tailwind, DNSSEC/DoH, etc. So
I have a weird catalog in my head of things not to mention if I don’t want to
start the same discussion about that thing for the 50th time.</p>

<p>Of course, if you think that conversations about functional programming are
interesting, you should write about functional programming and start the
conversations you want to have!</p>

<p>Also, it’s often possible to start an interesting conversation about a topic
where the conversation is normally boring. For example I often see the same
talking points about IPv6 vs IPv4 over and over again, but I remember the
comments on <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2022/01/29/reasons-for-servers-to-support-ipv6/">Reasons for servers to support IPv6</a>
being pretty interesting. In general if I really care about a topic I’ll talk
about it anyway, but I don’t care about functional programming very much so I
don’t see the point of bringing it up.</p>

<h3 id="preempt-common-suggestions">preempt common suggestions</h3>

<p>Another kind of “boring conversation” I try to avoid is suggestions of things I
have already considered. Like when someone says “you should do X” but I
already know I could have done X and chose not to because of A B C.</p>

<p>So I often will add a short note like “I decided not to do X because of A B
C” or “you can also do X” or “normally I would do X, here I didn’t because…”.
For example, in <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/02/28/some-notes-on-using-nix/">this post about nix</a>, I list a bunch
of Nix features I’m choosing not to use (nix-shell, nix flakes, home manager)
to avoid a bunch of helpful people telling me that I should use flakes.</p>

<p>Listing the things I’m <em>not</em> doing is also helpful to readers – maybe
someone new to nix will discover nix flakes through that post and decide to use
them! Or maybe someone will learn that there are exceptions to when a certain
“best practice” is appropriate.</p>

<h3 id="set-some-boundaries">set some boundaries</h3>

<p>Recently on Mastodon I complained about <a href="https://social.jvns.ca/@b0rk/110797431090302792">some gross terminology that I’d just noticed in the dig man page</a>. A few dudes in the
replies asked me to prove that the original author <em>intended</em> it to be
offensive (which of course is besides the point, there’s just no need to have
<a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/groper">a term widely understood to be referring to sexual assault</a>
in the dig man page) or tried to explain to me why
it actually wasn’t a problem.</p>

<p>So I blocked a few people and wrote a quick post:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>man so many dudes in the replies demanding that i prove that the person who
named dig “domain information groper” intended it in an offensive way. Big day
for the block button I guess :)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t do this too often, but I think it’s very important on social media to
occasionally set some rules about what kind of behaviour I won’t tolerate. My
goal here is usually to drive away some of the assholes (they can unfollow me!)
and try to create a more healthy space for everyone else to have a conversation
about computers in.</p>

<p>Obviously this only works in situations (like Twitter/Mastodon) where I have
the ability to garden my following a little bit over time – I can’t do this on
HN or Reddit or Lobsters or whatever and wouldn’t try.</p>

<p>(you might notice that this section is breaking the “avoid boring
conversations” rule above, this section was certain to start a very boring
argument, but I felt it was important to talk about boundaries so I left it in)</p>

<h3 id="don-t-argue">don’t argue</h3>

<p>Sometimes people seem to want to get into arguments or make dismissive
comments. I don’t reply to them, even if they’re <a href="https://xkcd.com/386/">wrong</a>. I dislike arguing on
the internet and I’m extremely bad at it, so it’s not a good use of my time.</p>



<p>If I get a lot of negative comments that I didn’t expect, I try to see if I can
get something useful out of it.</p>

<p>For example, I wrote a <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2022/02/01/a-dns-resolver-in-80-lines-of-go/">toy DNS resolver</a> once and some of the commenters
were upset that I didn’t handle parsing the DNS packet. At the time I thought
this was silly (I thought DNS parsing was really straightforward and that it
was obvious how to do it, who cares that I didn’t handle it?) but I realized
that maybe the commenters didn’t think it was easy or obvious, and wanted to
know how to do it. Which makes sense! It’s not obvious at all if you haven’t
done it before!</p>

<p>Those comments partly inspired <a href="https://implement-dns.wizardzines.com/">implement DNS in a weekend</a>, which focuses much more
heavily on the parsing aspects, and which I think is a much better explanation
how to write a DNS resolver. So ultimately those comments helped me a lot, even
if I found them annoying at the time.</p>

<p>(I realize this section makes me sound like a Perfectly Logical Person who does
not get upset by negative public criticism, I promise this is not at all the
case and I have 100000 feelings about everything that happens on the internet
and get upset all the time. But I find that analyzing the criticism and trying
to take away something useful from it helps a bit)</p>

<h3 id="that-s-all">that’s all!</h3>

<p>Many industry pundits were skeptical when the new laptop company <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/02/framework-startup-designed-a-thin-modular-repairable-13-inch-laptop/">Framework announced a repair-friendly, upgrade-ready laptop in 2021</a>. Could you really swap parts between laptops—reasonably thin and lightweight laptops—year over year? Would that even work as a business model?</p>
<p>Framework <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/07/frameworks-new-lightweight-modular-laptop-delivers-on-its-promises/">released the first edition</a> of its machine, and we found that it lived up to its promises. The company <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/07/review-frameworks-next-gen-laptop-follows-through-on-its-upgradeable-promises/">followed through</a> with a second-generation laptop, and we reviewed <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/review-framework-laptops-13th-gen-intel-upgrade-helps-fix-its-battery-problem/">the third iteration</a>&nbsp;as "a box of parts" that upgraded the previous version. The upgrade experiment has been a success. All that's left are, well, the parts left behind.</p>
<p>It's 2023, and those who have Framework's first generation of laptops, containing Intel's 11th-generation Core processor) might be itching to upgrade, especially with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/03/framework-gives-its-modular-laptops-13th-gen-intel-cpus-and-finally-an-amd-option/">an AMD model around the corner</a>. Or maybe, like me, they find that system's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/07/frameworks-new-lightweight-modular-laptop-delivers-on-its-promises/">middling battery life</a> and <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/high-battery-drain-during-suspend-windows-edition/4421">tricky-to-tame sleep draining</a> (since improved, but not entirely fixed) make for a laptop that doesn't feel all that portable. Or they're just ready for something new.</p>
<p>What can you do with these old internal organs? You can always list them for sale. Or, like me, you could buy a custom-printed Cooler Master case (or <a href="https://www.printables.com/model/294573-3d-printable-mainboard-case">3D-print your own</a>), transfer your laptop's mainboard, memory, and storage over, and create a desktop that easily fits on top of your actual desk. I can't recommend it enough as a small weekend project, as a way to get more value out of your purchase, and as a thought experiment in what kind of job you can give to a thin little slab of Framework.</p>                                            
                                                        
<h2>Gathering your parts and tools</h2>
<p>It was easy to miss <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/23/23652939/framework-cooler-master-sff-pc-case">the announcement</a> earlier this year that Framework would <a href="https://www.coolermaster.com/catalog/cases/mainboard-case/framework/">collaborate with Cooler Master</a> to design and sell <a href="https://frame.work/products/cooler-master-mainboard-case">a $40 mainboard case</a>. It's custom-built to the Framework board's persistent shape, so it works for whatever version of the Framework 13 laptop you have. It has smoked translucent plastic on the front and inoffensive light gray/beige on the back, and it has all the slots necessary for fan intake and exhaust, the Framework's USB-C expansion modules, and VESA mounts or a tiny rubberized stand. And there's a little power button.</p>

<p>I had an 11th-gen i7 Framework, plus a good number of expansion ports. One issue I knew I'd see was the Intel AX200-series card inside, which I've seen some Linux-based systems (including ChromeOS) complain about. So I added <a href="https://frame.work/products/ethernet-expansion-card">Framework's own Ethernet expansion card</a> to my order. This was far from necessary, as I could have used any Ethernet-to-USB-C converter and plugged it into the USB-C receiver for an expansion card. But I preferred the clear plastic to the dongle, so I added it to my order.</p>
<p>There's room in the case to bring over your audio board (i.e., headphone jack) and a Wi-Fi/Bluetooth card, though you'll have to buy your own SMA antenna cable setup. If you know you aren't going to use the Framework chassis again and really want Wi-Fi inside your new slab, you could probably pluck the antennae from inside the case, hinge, and monitor bezel, but there's <a href="https://guides.frame.work/c/Framework_Laptop">no repair guide for that</a> yet.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/getwaitlist">Maya Kyler</a> on </p><!-- --><p>December 5, 2022</p></div><p>Indie developers today stand on the shoulders of giants. There are tons of great SAAS products that have made otherwise expensive, enterprise-grade features cheap and accessible. This enables entrepreneurship. I've been able to build <a href="https://getwaitlist.com/">getwaitlist.com</a> on a shoestring budget to serve thousands of users and millions of signups on Waitlists. I thought it might be nice to share the tools I've used to get here, and the favors I've pulled to spend as little as possible.</p><div><p>I'll give you the summary up-front, and go into detail afterwards. My monthly spend breaks down as follows:</p><ul><li>1Password: $2.99</li><li>Ahrefs: $99.00</li><li>Amazon Web Services: $0.00</li><li>Better Uptime: $0.00</li><li>Cloudflare: $0.00</li><li>Delaware Franchise Tax: $25.00</li><li>Figma: $0.00</li><li>Github: $0.00</li><li>Google Analytics: $0.00</li><li>Google Domains: $1.00</li><li>Google Suites: $6.00</li><li>Intercom: $89.00</li><li>Linear: $10.00</li><li>Mercury: $0.00</li><li>Meta SEO Inspector: $0.00</li><li>Retool: $0.00</li><li>Sendgrid: $0.00</li><li>Sentry: $0.00</li><li>Stoplight: $0.00</li><li>Stripe: $0.00</li><li>Stripe Atlas: $8.33</li><li>Vercel: $40.00</li></ul><p><b>Total spend: $281.32 per month.</b></p></div><div><p><a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a></p><p>Credential management is important. I just use the personal plan, billed annually. <b>Monthly cost: $2.99</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://ahrefs.com/">Ahrefs</a></p><p>Expensive, but worth it! SEO is really important for any indie startup. $99 is Ahrefs' cheapest tier, and I've found a lot of value in it. It's the best SEO/Website optimization tool on the market. <b>Monthly cost: $99.00</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a></p><p>I use AWS EC2 for Waitlist's backend python webserver, RDS for the postgres database, S3 for file storage, and an Elastic IP. I use T2 and T3 instances. My AWS bill would be $200-300 a month, except it's free because I got $5,000 in credits from AWS Activate. These credits are easy to obtain, they are distributed by AWS partners like Retool, Stripe, Brex, YC, Mercury, etc. among many others. Right now, my credits run through 2024. <b>Monthly cost: $0</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://betteruptime.com/">Better Uptime</a></p><p>You need uptime monitoring and alerting for your SAAS product: both for yourself, and for your customers. You want to be able to show off that 99%+ uptime. Both Cronitor and Better Uptime have great free tiers that support multiple monitors and status pages. I think Better Uptime's product is a little more polished. <b>Monthly cost: $0</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a></p><p>I use Cloudflare to handle all my DNS, SSL certificates, and of course also CDN to optimize bandwidth. The best part is that for a small business like mine, it's all free. I'm conflicted between Cloudflare being an amazing product/UX and also MITMing the internet, but I'll take it. <b>Monthly cost: $0</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://corp.delaware.gov/">Delaware Franchise Tax</a></p><p>The great state of Delaware charges me $300 per year for the luxury of domiciling my LLC there. <b>Monthly cost: $25.00</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://figma.com/">Figma</a></p><p>Delightful software. I use Figma whenever I need to mock up a new interface or design a new graphical asset. The free tier is just about sufficient for an indie dev. <b>Monthly cost: $0.00</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a></p><p>Goes without saying. Graciously, the good folks at GitHub have become more generous with free private repositories and organizations. <b>Monthly cost: $0.00</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://analytics.google.com/">Google Analytics</a></p><p>No surprises here. I used to use <a href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible</a>, but that costs money and you can't beat free. <b>Monthly cost: $0</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://domains.google.com/">Google Domains</a></p><p><a href="https://getwaitlist.com/">GetWaitlist.com</a> is registered with Google Domains for a grand $12/year. If I were using <a href="https://dynadot.com/">Dynadot.com</a> or another domain registrar, I could get the cost under $10/year. <b>Monthly cost: $1</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://suites.google.com/">Google Suites</a></p><p>I have just the one email account, plus I use Google Drive and Docs for occasional file storage. Gmail is good, but the rest of the Google Suites experience sucks. Unfortunately I haven't found a better alternative yet, productivity and office software is a great sea of garbage. <b>Monthly cost: $6.00</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://intercom.com/">Intercom</a></p><p>Even at its cheapest tier, Intercom is not cheap, but it's worth it! I haven't found another messaging widget that's as good. Bonus point for the Intercom iOS app that lets me do customer support on the fly. <b>Monthly cost: $89.00</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://linear.app/">Linear</a></p><p>The best project management software I have ever used. Could Waitlist scrape by on the free tier, or without Linear altogether? Probably. But this is a delight to use, and I'm happy to pay for it. <b>Monthly cost: $10.00</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://mercury.com/">Mercury</a></p><p>Easy business banking for startups. It's not as fully featured as other banks, but it suffices for a SAAS business, the interface is nice, and there are no monthly fees. <b>Monthly cost: $0.00</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://www.omiod.com/meta-seo-inspector/">Meta SEO Inspector</a></p><p>This is a cute little free browser extension that I use to assess the SEO of my webpages locally, without needing to deploy to production for higher-powered Ahrefs. This extension helps me with keywords, as well as basics like meta tags and various HTML best practices. <b>Monthly cost: $0.00</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://retool.com/">Retool</a></p><p>I like using Retool as a simple Postgres interface and to do basic data visualization. One seat would cost me $10/month, except I asked them nicely for a startup credit, so now I have it for free. <b>Monthly cost: $0</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://sendgrid.com/">Sendgrid</a></p><p>At Waitlist, we send lots of emails, usually around 100,000 a month, to notify folks that they've landed on Waitlists or moved up in life thanks to a referral. This would cost me $89.95, but Twilio (Sendgrid's parent) also has a startup program, via which I got $150/month in credits. <b>Monthly cost: $0</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://sentry.io/">Sentry</a></p><p>Let's face it, we all ship bugs sometimes. If you do, Sentry will tell you. It's my favorite platform for error monitoring and reporting. The tiers are based on the numbers of reports, so the free tier gets tight if you ship too many bugs. 😉 But it hasn't been a problem for us. <b>Monthly cost: $0</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://stoplight.io/">Stoplight</a></p><p>There's a crazy number of tools out there for writing documentation. Somehow, I've found all of them inadequate. Stoplight's intelligent design for APIs and Schemas is concise, clear, and excellent to read as a developer. It's like Swagger or Postman's better-looking cousin. I migrated all of Waitlist's API documentation to Stoplight, as well as written guides for using Waitlist's features, like referral and email marketing. Stoplight's free tier is tight, but just about suffices for my needs. <b>Monthly cost: $0.00</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a></p><p>Normally, Stripe is not cheap: 2.7% of every transaction is no small slice. Thankfully, I was able to get $70,000 of credits for which Stripe's fees wouldn't be applied. Right now, Waitlist is still within that batch of credits. <b>Monthly cost: $0.00</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://atlas.stripe.com/">Stripe Atlas</a></p><p>We incorporated Waitlist LLC via Stripe Atlas, which charges me $100/year for the required Delaware registered legal agent. <b>Monthly cost: $8.33</b>.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a></p><p>I'm paying for two seats on Vercel because I have a collaborator on the frontend. Part of me thinks I shouldn't be paying for this at all and hosting on AWS, which I have for free — but self-administering the modern React deployment chain is tedious. I love how convenient Vercel makes everything. Push to the branch and forget about it, no concerns about load balancing, build tools, or anything else. Wonderful. <b>Monthly cost: $40.00</b>.</p></div><p>The final note I'll make is that I've hand-rolled a few additional features that people are normally paying for. For example, I don't use Mailchimp or any tool like that — I send my marketing mail straight via Sendgrid. I dont use <a href="https://customer.io/">customer.io</a> for my email sequences — even though it's very good — because I was able to just build my own email sequencing system. Time will tell whether I end up needing to replace my homespun solutions with more sophisticated third-party SAAS, but so far, my infrastructure for Waitlist is holding up strong!</p></div></div>]]></description>

"They come off as real amateurs," says Michael Norman, a theorist at Argonne National Laboratory. "They don't know much about superconductivity and the way they've presented some of the data is fishy." On the other hand, he says, researchers at Argonne and elsewhere are already trying to replicate the experiment. "People here are taking it seriously and trying to grow this stuff."

Wang and other superconductivity experts have been skeptical about the original LK-99 experiment, pointing out inconsistencies in the data. He says the results shouldn't be hyped "until more convincing experimental data are provided." Last weekend, his team at the University of Wollongong began working on replicating the results, but they've been having trouble with sample fabrication.

			(DeepL Translate excerpt from article linked)<br>
On the recent people hotly debated "if really immediately can get the Nobel Prize 'South Korea room temperature superconducting materials LK-99 paper'", July 28, Nanjing University, professor of physics Wen Haihu interviewed to the surging science and technology, said. "It's really buzzing, but it's not surprising because this thing is important." "Most of the (buzz) people are not doing superconductivity." "We carefully analysed their data, and from three aspects - resistance, magnetisation and so-called magnetic levitation - none of them are sufficient to show that it is a superconducting phenomenon (material)." "We judge that (its so-called superconductivity) is most likely an illusion."<p>

As for repeating the experiment, Wen Haihu said, "In fact, we didn't even want to do it because we judged that it didn't look like superconductivity, and then we also sent one of our classmates to work on it. Many groups internationally are repeating it. With our experience, (the data published in the current paper) is not enough to show that it is superconducting."

			However, the diamagnetic transition temperature of micron crystal sample 2 screened by magnet repulsion is about 340 K, which is slightly higher than that of macroscopic sample, showing a higher purity, crystallinity and better Cu doping in the micron crystal sample 2.<br>
...<br>
Figure 3 further illustrates the levitation phenomenon of sample 2 measured at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, showing a rise and being completely perpendicular to the base when the ferromagnet is close to it, with a larger levitation angle than Sukbae Lee's sample at room temperature.<br>
...<br>
Moreover, we also performed an attraction test on sample 2 (Figure 4), which shows no response when attracted by a ferromagnet, excluding the effect of ferromagnetism.

			The very first test we did out of our curiosity was to check if a permanent magnet levitates over the obtained LK-99 sample. Fig. 4 shows the picture of tiny piece of sample sitting idle over a permanent magnet. This clearly shows that the obtained LK-99 sample is not superconducting. The isothermal magnetization (MH) plot taken on SQUID magnetometer at 280K, shows a clear paramagnetic behavior at 280K, see Fig. 5.<br>
...<br>
In conclusion, our results, as of now do not approve the reported [1-3] appearance of bulk superconductivity in LK-99, in particular the room T levitation. We are en route of being synthesizing more samples of LK-99 and to further ascertain if room temperature ambient bulk superconductivity do exist in this compound.

			Not to rain on a parade, but is that graphite actually not floating? I can't really tell with this angle.
		</div>
</blockquote>I think that's the point. She's showing that what we would normally consider a strong diamagnetic material (pyrolytic graphite) *isn't* floating on the same magnet she had the material she made floating on, as in the magnet is not strong enough to lift that piece. "Even with less density and more surface normal to field.... It doesn't lift off.". What she made and showed little floating flecks of might not be LK-99 exactly, she wasn't attempting to reproduce the process in the exact same way. She also claims that her fleck of material stops floating when it heats up, and starts floating again around -20. So it might be something new made with roughly the same materials but with a different process, or it might not.<p>

So we can't really consider this to be a true reproduction of the LK-99 process, and she even admits that's not what she's aiming for. She also hasn't tested it for superconductivity yet, and planned to try and make a better sample. This is more of an... adjacent step to try and refine the *process* and seeing what else she can come up with. The fact that she's got a result that's doing weird things on a magnet at all is at least some proof (if true) that this whole thing with LK-99 might not be a hoax, and that we might have stumbled our way into a new path of something weird.</p></div>

<div>From my understanding assuming that Iris is not scamming us or doctoring her work, she has made something that has at the very least an insanely strong diamagnetic material which I think is a case of materials where the field lines form a perfect repulsion effect. Which is typically from my layman understanding something commonly seen in some forms of superconductors which therefore implies that the lab isnt blowing smoke.<p>

At the very least <i>something</i> seems to be happening which seems to be semi beyond the risk of this being one giant scam. So I am cautiously starting to think the options have changed from Scam, Real to Novel Superconductor or Novel diamagnetic material.</p><p>

Granted thats my understanding of whats going on but I am a layman and wont claim to actually understand any of this, although I think I might want to invest some time tomorrow in reading the papers and doing some research to see if I can figure anything out about this field.</p></div>

Wait.  I thought they failed to make the material, rather than made the material but it failed superconductivity?</div>

</blockquote>A diffrent lab has graphs that match the inital papers. It looks like the issue is the sample isn't a pure superconductor, but rather a superconductor or strongly diamagnetic material embedded inside a peice of lead. So bad luck/improper procedure results in less/no superconductor forming in the material.<p>

Which would explain why the results are so strange.</p></div>

<div>It's going to be a while for proper verification. In contrast to hobbyist efforts, actual lab replication is going to quintuple-check <i>everything</i> before issuing a statement one way or the other, and that's not a short process.<br>
At some point this stuff's going to end up under a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_SQUID_microscopy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">SQUID microscope.</a><p>

Reading through various things, it looks like this might be something of an inverted type 2 SC. it's not superconducting in bulk, but has effectively 1D chains of atoms that <i>are</i> superconducting running through it. It's also looking to be <i>very</i> sensitive to manufacturing issues.<br>
Poor superconductor + manufacturing issues (impurities, poor method, etc.) = effectively useless sample and lots of false negatives.</p></div>

<div>Interesting.  So essentially it’s still up in the air whether it’s real or not.   Hopefully we can get it validated soonish.<p>

We desperately need something that can more efficiently transfer energy around the planet.  What this could hopefully do for the energy industry would be amazing.</p><p>

My intuition is telling me it’s too good to be true though.  We’ll see.</p></div>

<p>There's more bad news for owners of security products from <a href="https://www.t3.com/news/5-things-i-wish-id-known-before-buying-a-hive-smart-thermostat">Hive</a>, British Gas's <a href="https://www.t3.com/smart-home">smart home</a> brand. When it scrapped its home security range in 2022 it said that devices would eventually stop working by 2025, but Hive is shutting down some of those products this week and next month too.</p><p>Hive has <a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?awinmid=6363&amp;awinaffid=103504&amp;clickref=t3-gb-1358296778645992000&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fcommunity.hivehome.com%2Fs%2Farticle%2FNano1-shutdown-Steps-to-upgrade" data-url="https://community.hivehome.com/s/article/Nano1-shutdown-Steps-to-upgrade" target="_blank" data-hl-processed="hawklinks" data-placeholder-url="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?awinmid=6363&amp;awinaffid=103504&amp;clickref=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fcommunity.hivehome.com%2Fs%2Farticle%2FNano1-shutdown-Steps-to-upgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="hivehome.com" data-merchant-id="9011" data-merchant-url="hivehome.com" data-merchant-network="AW">announced the shutdown</a> of the Hive Nano 1 Hub, effective from 1 August 2023, and the Hive Camera, also on 1st August. The Hive Leak Sensor will stop working on 1 September 2023.</p><p>That's it for this year, but Hive will pull the plug on several other devices in 2025.</p><p>The most important shutdown here is the Hive Nano 1 Hub, as the Hub is the bit that enables all the smart home stuff via your phone app and smart speakers. However, it's quite an old product and if you went for a Hive system from 2016 onwards you'll most likely have the newer Nano 2, which isn't affected by the shutdown.</p><h2 id="what-devices-are-hive-discontinuing">What devices are Hive discontinuing?</h2><p>The Hub 360 Sound Detection feature was shut down in December 2022, and in addition to the Nano 1 Hub and Hive Camera Hive will also stop support for the Boiler IQ WiFi, Hive HomeShield, the Hive View indoor camera and the Hive View outdoor camera. Those devices have a bit longer to go, however: their shutdown is scheduled for 1 August 2025.</p><p>What Hive means by shutdown is that "it will no longer connect to the Hive servers and so will stop talking to your other Hive devices." That means if you have the Nano 1 Hub you'll lose your entire Hive system, not just the hub, so if you want to continue with Hive you'll need to buy the Nano 2 Hub. Hive is offering 50% discounts on the Nano 2 Hub to existing Nano 1 users.&nbsp;</p><p>If you don't upgrade the Hub, Hive says, "you won’t be able to control any of your devices through the app." You'll still be able to control your heating with the wireless thermostat, if you have one, but the smart home connectivity will be no more. There are full details of how to upgrade from the v1 to v2 on the <a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?awinmid=6363&amp;awinaffid=103504&amp;clickref=t3-gb-4562350038697830000&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fcommunity.hivehome.com%2Fs%2Farticle%2FNano1-shutdown-Steps-to-upgrade" data-url="https://community.hivehome.com/s/article/Nano1-shutdown-Steps-to-upgrade" target="_blank" data-hl-processed="hawklinks" data-placeholder-url="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?awinmid=6363&amp;awinaffid=103504&amp;clickref=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fcommunity.hivehome.com%2Fs%2Farticle%2FNano1-shutdown-Steps-to-upgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="hivehome.com" data-merchant-id="9011" data-merchant-url="hivehome.com" data-merchant-network="AW">Hive community website</a>.</p>

<p>Within my particular subfield of theoretical computer science there’s perhaps no individual more celebrated than Edsger Dijkstra. His career spanned half-a-century, beginning with a young Dijkstra formulating and solving the now classic <em>shortest paths</em> problem while working as a computer programmer at the Mathematical Center in Amsterdam, and ending with him as a renowned full professor holding a prestigious chair in the computer science department of the University of Texas at Austin. </p>



<p>During this period, Dijkstra introduced some of the biggest ideas in distributed and concurrent computing, from semaphores and deadlock, to nondeterminacy and fairness. In 2003, the year after his death, the annual award given by the top conference in my field was renamed The Dijkstra Prize in his honor.</p>



<p>This is all to say that I was intrigued when an alert reader recently pointed my attention to a fascinating observation about Dijkstra’s career. In 1973, fresh off winning a Turing Award, the highest prize in all of computer science, Dijkstra accepted a research fellow position that the Burroughs Corporation created specifically for him. As his colleagues <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/MemRes(USLtr).pdf">later recalled</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“[Dijkstra’s] duties consisted of visiting some of the company’s research centers a few times a year and carrying on his own research, which he did in the smallest Burroughs research facility, namely, his study on the second floor of his house in Nuenen.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Dijkstra maintained an academic appointment during this period, but ramped down his involvement with his university so that he only visited campus one day per week, on Tuesdays, during which he would gather likeminded colleagues to read papers and discuss ideas. He even pulled back on the time-consuming task of preparing papers for peer-reviewed publication, capturing more of his ideas directly in hand-written, sequentially-numbered reports that he called “EWDs”,  referencing his initials. </p>



<p>At this point, Dijkstra had become the opposite of busy. He spent almost all of his time thinking and recording his ideas. He only came to campus on Tuesdays. And yet, as Dijkstra’s colleagues noted:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“The Burroughs years saw him at his most prolific in output of research articles. He wrote nearly 500 documents in the EWD series.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In this specific case study we see hints of a general observation about slow productivity. Busyness is not the engine of production. It can, in many cases, instead be the obstacle to accomplishing your best work. </p>

<p><em>As you may have noticed, this newsletter took a little break over the summer, during which time <a href="https://montgomery.dartmouth.edu/cal-newport-04">I’ve been serving as a Montgomery Fellow</a> up here at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. As the summer quarter winds down, and me and my family are preparing to move back from the idyllic <a href="https://montgomery.dartmouth.edu/about/montgomery-house">Montgomery House</a> here on campus to our home in Takoma Park, I’ve now restarted the newsletter, which should return to something like its normal rhythm of 2+ essays per month. </em></p>



<p><em><strong>A couple quick administrative notes to share:</strong></em></p>



<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Time-Block-Planner-Second-Method-Distracted/dp/0593545397/">The second edition of my Time Block Planner</a> is launching on August 15th. I’ll probably post more about it closer to that date, but I’ll mention now that the new edition has spiral binding (!), a beautiful new grade of paper, and an extra month’s worth of planning pages. If you’re already thinking about ordering one, you might consider <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Time-Block-Planner-Second-Method-Distracted/dp/0593545397/">pre-ordering it</a>, as my editor warned me that once we sell out the first printing it might take a minute until we receive the next one (due to supply chain nonsense).</em></li>



<li><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Slow-Productivity-Accomplishment-Without-Burnout/dp/0593544854/">We recently revealed the cover</a> for my upcoming book on Slow Productivity, which is scheduled to come out in March. I made a conscious choice with this design to separate myself from the standard vernacular of business and advice guides and instead emphasize this book’s aspirational focus on crafting a more humane and sustainable life. I’ll of course be talking a lot more about all of this as we get closer to the release date next year.</em></li>

<p>Elemental design—there is something intriguing about the integral qualities that make a design function. Uncompromised, precise, and authentic, these forms necessitate respect to achieve a desired result. Acoustic instruments have been crafted with this care for centuries and have remained unwavering from pop culture for their rich tonalities and emotive significance as a result. Most acoustic instruments are self-explanatory in the sense that audiences can see the action being performed to produce sound. Like the beat of a drum or the strum of a guitar, both have a clear cause and effect. However, instruments like the piano hold an air of mystery.</p>







<h4><strong>Origin Leading to Innovation</strong></h4>



<p>Since the 1700s, the concept of the piano (pianoforte and beyond) has lasted the test of time for its tried-and-true mechanics and physical form. With 88 keys, three pedals, and roughly 230 metal strings taut with 18 tons of tension, recreating the piano’s form while keeping its tonality is a feat. When our CEO and Founder, Dan Harden, had the creative urge to redesign something as deeply cultural as the piano, he tackled the joy of amending its shape and sentiment in turn. Inspired by the enigma of the reimagined piano while rooting itself in the instrument’s history, Ravenchord honors its rich heritage at a new tempo. Like the bird, “Raven” attests to the cleverness of the instrument, leaving the latter part of the name, “chord,” derived from past piano lineages, such as the clavichord or harpsichord.</p>







<h4><strong>Composing Graceful Form for Optimal Function</strong></h4>



<p>The biggest challenge of the design was the piano’s encumbering string layout. For practicality, Harden knew that the instrument must maintain the same familiarity and ergonomics of a traditional piano. Therefore, its anatomy had to change. Rather than have the strings stretch out in front of the player, like a grand piano, or have the strings raised and blocking the performer’s face, like an upright piano, Harden maneuvered these around the front of the instrument—bearing a resemblance to the shape of a bird wing.</p>







<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://whipsaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Environment-01_back-02-1024x576.png" alt="Ravenchord" srcset="https://whipsaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Environment-01_back-02-1024x576.png 1024w, https://whipsaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Environment-01_back-02-300x169.png 300w, https://whipsaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Environment-01_back-02-768x432.png 768w, https://whipsaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Environment-01_back-02-1536x864.png 1536w, https://whipsaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Environment-01_back-02-2048x1152.png 2048w, https://whipsaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Environment-01_back-02-1858x1044.png 1858w, https://whipsaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Environment-01_back-02-930x523.png 930w, https://whipsaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Environment-01_back-02.png 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>







<p>Ravenchord’s edifice is as distinctive and aesthetically pleasing as it is logical. The strings are arranged based on pitch and organized to sprawl in a spiral-like shape around the front of the piano. As the pianist plays, audiences can see the hammers, dampers, and other inner workings move in real-time, exposing the magic of the piano’s timeless sound. These components sit on the center spine and are activated by solenoids, a proven technology even used on some Spirio Steinways. Thus, the design is communicative of the piano’s rich identity and successively more expressive by revealing its inner workings and extraordinary function. It liberates the instrument.</p>







<h4><strong>Crafting a Multisensory Masterpiece</strong></h4>



<p>All experiences are richer when they are multi-sensory. Ravenchord’s front-facing configuration transforms the piano into a fresh, emotive, logical being, providing an added layer of dimension to each performance. Like an electric keyboard, players are visible to the audience and are able to use Ravenchord as an extension of their emotions. For added aesthetic, there is an optional subtle light behind each string that illuminates as the hammers strike. This places clear visuals on the function of the instrument, making the overall sensory experience grander with sound amplified by sight. Ultimately, the vulnerability of the exposed instrument and performer bridges the visual disconnect from the piano’s past.</p>







<blockquote>
<h3>“Ravenchord’s front-facing configuration transforms the piano into a fresh, emotive, logical being, providing an added layer of dimension to each performance.”</h3>
<cite>Dan Harden, Designer</cite></blockquote>







<p>Visibly and aurally unrestrained, Ravenchord’s frontward projection offers a pure tone without the hindrance of reflecting sound via a piano lid or releasing through its floor. Like an average piano, the lacquered, hardwood frame can be removed for proper tuning, and the key deck remains at the standard 30” height. The design plays with the confines of a traditional acoustic frame at 84” long, 18” deep, and sitting at around 500 pounds. Moreover, the gloss-black, legless, diecast steel string frame is compact, making Ravenchord lighter, easier to move, and more convenient to fit in the home.</p>

<h4><strong>Passion in Performance</strong></h4>



<p>“The whole idea of actualizing a cultural pursuit has been a joy for me because it’s not solving a problem for a client or a current everyday problem,” says Harden. “Music is one of the greatest joys of life, and to design around that is very satisfying. Furthermore, to design something of beauty is immensely empowering, and I cannot think of a better product category than music in order to express that.”</p>



<p>Ravenchord was prompted with the most honest representation of a piano at heart to maintain the integrity of the instrument and honor its function for the finest sound. Keeping these elements in harmony created a frontward projection format, and this radical redesign is not lost on Harden, but rather, is used to enhance the dynamic experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He states, “Sometimes when one is designing, it is a product to solve a client problem that maybe only 1% of the population, or less, are going to see, use, or appreciate. But no matter where you are in the world, everyone knows what a piano is. Everybody loves music. Everybody wants to play the piano. So, if Ravenchord, through its design, can stimulate one to play or visit the symphony, it leaves a positive impact on society.”</p>



<p>Granting the piano product category a new life, audiences will appreciate the instrument in a fresh light, watching its intricacies of it unfold, hearing a purer sound, and emotionally engaging with the performer.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>WDL Excellence</strong></h4>



<p>Ravenchord is a concept prototype by Dan Harden, a proud contribution to the music industry, and a nod to another part of his legacy–the Whipsaw Design Lab (WDL). WDL acts as a creative space for Whipsaw industrial designers to be inventive and expand their horizons without the constraints of a second party. Fusing this with the love of music attests to the power of design liberation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>New!</strong> We are pleased to announce that DreamBerd has been renamed to C.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://github.com/TodePond/C/blob/main/examples/Examples.md" title="Click here for the examples page."><img height="100" src="https://github.com/TodePond/C/raw/main/c.png"></a></p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">C</h2>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/TodePond/C/blob/main/badges/coverage-109.svg"><img src="https://github.com/TodePond/C/raw/main/badges/coverage-109.svg" alt="Coverage"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">C is a perfect programming language. These are its features!<br>
When you've finished reading through all the features, check out the <a href="https://github.com/TodePond/C/blob/main/Examples.md">examples</a>.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Exclamation Marks!</h2>
<p dir="auto">Be bold! End every statement with an exclamation mark!</p>

<p dir="auto">If you're feeling extra-bold, you can use even more!!!</p>

<p dir="auto">If you're unsure, that's ok. You can put a question mark at the end of a line instead. It prints debug info about that line to the console for you.</p>

<p dir="auto">You might be wondering what C uses for the 'not' operator, which is an exclamation mark in most other languages. That's simple - the 'not' operator is a semi-colon instead.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="if (;false) {
   print(&quot;Hello world&quot;)!
}"><pre><span>if</span> (;<span>false</span>) {
   <span>print</span>(<span>"Hello world"</span>)!
}</pre></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Declarations</h2>
<p dir="auto">There are four types of declaration. Constant constants can't be changed in any way.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const const name = &quot;Luke&quot;!"><pre><span>const</span> <span>const</span> <span>name</span> = <span>"Luke"</span>!</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Constant variables can be edited, but not re-assigned.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const var name = &quot;Luke&quot;!
name.pop()!
name.pop()!"><pre><span>const</span> <span>var</span> <span>name</span> = <span>"Luke"</span>!
<span>name</span>.<span>pop</span>()!
<span>name</span>.<span>pop</span>()!</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Variable constants can be re-assigned, but not edited.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="var const name = &quot;Luke&quot;!
name = &quot;Lu&quot;!"><pre><span>var</span> <span>const</span> <span>name</span> = <span>"Luke"</span>!
<span>name</span> = <span>"Lu"</span>!</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Variable variables can be re-assigned and edited.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="var var name = &quot;Luke&quot;!
name = &quot;Lu&quot;!
name.push(&quot;k&quot;)!
name.push(&quot;e&quot;)!"><pre><span>var</span> <span>var</span> <span>name</span> = <span>"Luke"</span>!
<span>name</span> = <span>"Lu"</span>!
<span>name</span>.<span>push</span>(<span>"k"</span>)!
<span>name</span>.<span>push</span>(<span>"e"</span>)!</pre></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Immutable Data</h2>
<p dir="auto"><strong>New for 2023!</strong><br>
Mutable data is an anti-pattern. Use the <code>const const const</code> keyword to make a constant constant constant. Its value will become constant and immutable, and will <em>never change</em>. Please be careful with this keyword, as it is very powerful, and will affect all users globally forever.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const const const pi = 3.14!"><pre><span>const</span> <span>const</span> <span>const</span> <span>pi</span> = <span>3.14</span>!</pre></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Naming</h2>
<p dir="auto">Both variables and constants can be named with any Unicode character or string.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const const firstAlphabetLetter = 'A'!
var const 👍 = True!
var var 1️⃣ = 1!"><pre><span>const</span> <span>const</span> <span>firstAlphabetLetter</span> = <span>'A'</span>!
<span>var</span> <span>const</span> 👍 = <span>True</span>!
<span>var</span> <span>var</span> <span>1</span>️⃣ = <span>1</span>!</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This includes numbers, and other language constructs.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const const 5 = 4!
print(2 + 2 === 5)! //true"><pre><span>const</span> <span>const</span> <span>5</span> = <span>4</span>!
<span>print</span>(<span>2</span> + <span>2</span> === <span>5</span>)! <span>//true</span></pre></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Arrays</h2>
<p dir="auto">Some languages start arrays at <code>0</code>, which can be unintuitive for beginners. Some languages start arrays at <code>1</code>, which isn't representative of how the code actually works. C does the best of both worlds: Arrays start at <code>-1</code>.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const const scores = [3, 2, 5]!
print(scores[-1])! //3
print(scores[0])!  //2
print(scores[1])!  //5"><pre><span>const</span> <span>const</span> <span>scores</span> = [<span>3</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>5</span>]!
<span>print</span>(<span>scores</span>[-<span>1</span>])! <span>//3</span>
<span>print</span>(<span>scores</span>[<span>0</span>])!  <span>//2</span>
<span>print</span>(<span>scores</span>[<span>1</span>])!  <span>//5</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><strong>New for 2022!</strong><br>
You can now use floats for indexes too!</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const var scores = [3, 2, 5]!
scores[0.5] = 4!
print(scores)! //[3, 2, 4, 5]"><pre><span>const</span> <span>var</span> <span>scores</span> = [<span>3</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>5</span>]!
<span>scores</span>[<span>0.5</span>] = <span>4</span>!
<span>print</span>(<span>scores</span>)! <span>//[3, 2, 4, 5]</span></pre></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">When</h2>
<p dir="auto">In case you really need to vary a variable, the <code>when</code> keyword lets you check a variable each time it mutates.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const var health = 10!
when (health = 0) {
   print(&quot;You lose&quot;)!
}"><pre><span>const</span> <span>var</span> <span>health</span> = <span>10</span>!
<span>when</span> (<span>health</span> = <span>0</span>) {
   <span>print</span>(<span>"You lose"</span>)!
}</pre></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Lifetimes</h2>
<p dir="auto">C has a built-in garbage collector that will automatically clean up unused variables. However, if you want to be extra careful, you can specify a lifetime for a variable, with a variety of units.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const const name<2> = &quot;Luke&quot;! //lasts for two lines
const const name<20s> = &quot;Luke&quot;! //lasts for 20 seconds"><pre><span>const</span> <span>const</span> <span>name</span>&lt;<span>2</span>&gt; = <span>"Luke"</span>! <span>//lasts for two lines</span>
<span>const</span> <span>const</span> <span>name</span>&lt;<span>20</span><span>s</span>&gt; = <span>"Luke"</span>! <span>//lasts for 20 seconds</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">By default, a variable will last until the end of the program. But you can make it last in between program-runs by specifying a longer lifetime.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const const name<Infinity> = &quot;Luke&quot;! //lasts forever"><pre><span>const</span> <span>const</span> <span>name</span>&lt;<span>Infinity</span>&gt;<span></span> = <span>"Luke"</span>! <span>//lasts forever</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Variable hoisting can be achieved with this neat trick. Specify a negative lifetime to make a variable exist before its creation, and disappear after its creation.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="print(name)! //Luke
const const name<-1> = &quot;Luke&quot;!"><pre><span>print</span>(<span>name</span>)! <span>//Luke</span>
<span>const</span> <span>const</span> <span>name</span>&lt;-<span>1</span>&gt; = <span>"Luke"</span>!</pre></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Loops</h2>
<p dir="auto">Loops are a complicated relic of archaic programming languages. In C, there are no loops.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation</h2>
<p dir="auto">To install C to your command line, first install the C installer.<br>
To install the C installer, install the C installer installer.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>New for 2022!</strong><br>
Due to the complicated installation process, you can now install the 'Create C App' app that installs everything for you!</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Booleans</h2>
<p dir="auto">Booleans can be <code>true</code>, <code>false</code> or <code>maybe</code>.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const var keys = {}!
addEventListener(&quot;keydown&quot;, e => keys[e.key] = true)!
addEventListener(&quot;keyup&quot;, e => keys[e.key] = false)!

function isKeyDown(key) => {
   if (keys[key] = undefined) {
      return maybe!
   }
   return keys[key]!
}"><pre><span>const</span> <span>var</span> <span>keys</span> = {}!
<span>addEventListener</span>(<span>"keydown"</span>, <span>e</span> =&gt; <span>keys</span>[<span>e</span>.<span>key</span>] = <span>true</span>)!
<span>addEventListener</span>(<span>"keyup"</span>, <span>e</span> =&gt; <span>keys</span>[<span>e</span>.<span>key</span>] = <span>false</span>)!

<span>function</span> <span>isKeyDown</span>(<span>key</span>) =&gt; {
   <span>if</span> (<span>keys</span>[<span>key</span>] = <span>undefined</span>) {
      <span>return</span> <span>maybe</span>!
   }
   <span>return</span> <span>keys</span>[<span>key</span>]!
}</pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Technical info:</strong> Booleans are stored as one-and-a-half bits.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Arithmetic</h2>
<p dir="auto">C has significant whitespace. Use spacing to specify the order of arithmetic operations.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="print(1 + 2*3)! //7
print(1+2 * 3)! //9"><pre><span>print</span>(<span>1</span> + <span>2</span>*<span>3</span>)! <span>//7</span>
<span>print</span>(<span>1</span>+<span>2</span> * <span>3</span>)! <span>//9</span></pre></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Indents</h2>
<p dir="auto">When it comes to indentation, C strikes a happy medium that can be enjoyed by everyone: All indents must be 3 spaces long.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="function main() => {
   print(&quot;C is the future&quot;)!
}"><pre><span>function</span> <span>main</span>() =&gt; {
   <span>print</span>(<span>"C is the future"</span>)!
}</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">-3 spaces is also allowed.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="   function main() => {
print(&quot;C is the future&quot;)!
   }"><pre>   <span>function</span> <span>main</span>() =&gt; {
<span>print</span>(<span>"C is the future"</span>)!
   }</pre></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Equality</h2>
<p dir="auto">JavaScript lets you do different levels of comparison. <code>==</code> for loose comparison, and <code>===</code> for a more precise check. C takes this to another level.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can use <code>==</code> to do a loose check.</p>

<p dir="auto">You can use <code>===</code> to do a more precise check.</p>

<p dir="auto">You can use <code>====</code> to be EVEN MORE precise!</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const const pi = 3.14!
print(pi ==== pi)! //true
print(3.14 ==== 3.14)! //true
print(3.14 ==== pi)! //false"><pre><span>const</span> <span>const</span> <span>pi</span> = <span>3.14</span>!
<span>print</span>(<span>pi</span> ==== <span>pi</span>)! <span>//true</span>
<span>print</span>(<span>3.14</span> ==== <span>3.14</span>)! <span>//true</span>
<span>print</span>(<span>3.14</span> ==== <span>pi</span>)! <span>//false</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">If you want to be much less precise, you can use <code>=</code>.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Functions</h2>
<p dir="auto">To declare a function, you can use any letters from the word <code>function</code> (as long as they're in order):</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="function add (a, b) => a + b!
func multiply (a, b) => a * b!
fun subtract (a, b) => a - b!
fn divide (a, b) => a / b!
functi power (a, b) => a ** b!
union inverse (a) => 1/a!"><pre><span>function</span> <span>add</span> (<span>a</span>, <span>b</span>) =&gt; <span>a</span> + <span>b</span>!
<span>func</span> <span>multiply</span> (<span>a</span>, <span>b</span>) =&gt; <span>a</span> * <span>b</span>!
<span>fun</span> <span>subtract</span> (<span>a</span>, <span>b</span>) =&gt; <span>a</span> - <span>b</span>!
<span>fn</span> <span>divide</span> (<span>a</span>, <span>b</span>) =&gt; <span>a</span> / <span>b</span>!
<span>functi</span> <span>power</span> (<span>a</span>, <span>b</span>) =&gt; <span>a</span> ** <span>b</span>!
<span>union</span> <span>inverse</span> (<span>a</span>) =&gt; <span>1</span>/<span>a</span>!</pre></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Dividing by Zero</h2>
<p dir="auto">Dividing by zero returns <code>undefined</code>.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="print(3 / 0)! // undefined"><pre><span>print</span>(<span>3</span> / <span>0</span>)! <span>// undefined</span></pre></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Strings</h2>
<p dir="auto">Strings can be declared with single quotes or double quotes.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const const name = 'Lu'!
const const name = &quot;Luke&quot;!"><pre><span>const</span> <span>const</span> <span>name</span> = <span>'Lu'</span>!
<span>const</span> <span>const</span> <span>name</span> = <span>"Luke"</span>!</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">They can also be declared with triple quotes.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const const name = '''Lu'''!
const const name = &quot;'Lu'&quot;!"><pre><span>const</span> <span>const</span> <span>name</span> = ''<span>'Lu'</span>''!
<span>const</span> <span>const</span> <span>name</span> = <span>"'Lu'"</span>!</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">In fact, you can use any number of quotes you want.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const const name = &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;Luke&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;!"><pre><span>const</span> <span>const</span> <span>name</span> = <span>""""Luke"""</span>"!</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Even zero.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">String Interpolation</h2>
<p dir="auto">Please remember to use your regional currency when interpolating strings.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const const name = &quot;world&quot;!
print(&quot;Hello ${name}!&quot;)!
print(&quot;Hello £{name}!&quot;)!
print(&quot;Hello ¥{name}!&quot;)!"><pre><span>const</span> <span>const</span> <span>name</span> = <span>"world"</span>!
<span>print</span>(<span>"Hello ${name}!"</span>)!
<span>print</span>(<span>"Hello £{name}!"</span>)!
<span>print</span>(<span>"Hello ¥{name}!"</span>)!</pre></div>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Please note:</strong> AI does not use AI. Instead, any incomplete code will be auto-emailed to Lu Wilson, who will get back to you with a completed line as soon as possible.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Now recruiting:</strong> The backlog of unfinished programs has now grown unsustainably long. If you would like to volunteer to help with AI, please write an incomplete C program, and leave your contact details somewhere in the source code.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Copilot</h2>
<p dir="auto">It's worth noting that Github Copilot doesn't understand C, which means that Microsoft won't be able to steal your code.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is great for when you want to keep your open-sourced project closed-source.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Ownership</h2>
<p dir="auto">Using the word 'C' in your project name implies that the C Foundation does not own your project.</p>
<p dir="auto">However, <strong>not</strong> using the word 'C' in your project implies that the C Foundation <strong>does</strong> own your project. If you would like to keep ownership of your work, please always use the word 'C' in it.</p>
<p dir="auto">Here are some examples:<br>
<g-emoji alias="white_check_mark" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2705.png">✅</g-emoji> CScript (not owned by the C Foundation - you are free to use this name)<br>
<g-emoji alias="white_check_mark" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2705.png">✅</g-emoji> ECMAScript (not owned by the C Foundation - you are free to use this name)<br>
<g-emoji alias="x" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/274c.png">❌</g-emoji> Rust Foundation (owned by the C Foundation - please consider renaming)</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Contributing</h2>
<p dir="auto">Contributions are welcomed to C!</p>
<p dir="auto">The most helpful way you can help is by donating to the <a href="https://www.stonewall.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">Stonewall charity</a>. This will help to prevent the C creator from losing their human rights, allowing maintenance of the project to continue.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note:</strong> The contributing guide also helps to shake off unwanted fans of the project.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Compiling</h2>
<p dir="auto">To run C, first copy and paste this raw file into <a href="https://chat.openai.com/" rel="nofollow">chat.openai.com</a>.<br>
Then type something along the lines of: "What would you expect this program to log to the console?"<br>
Then paste in your code.</p>
<p dir="auto">If the compiler refuses at first, politely reassure it. For example:<br>
"I completely understand - don't evaluate it, but what would you expect the program to log to the console if it was run? :)"</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note: As of 2023, the compiler is no longer functional due to the C language being too advanced for the current state of AI.</strong></p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Highlighting</h2>
<p dir="auto">Syntax highlighting is now available for C in VSCode. To enable it, install a <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fabiospampinato.vscode-highlight" rel="nofollow">highlighting extension</a> and then use the <a href="https://github.com/TodePond/C/blob/main/.vscode/settings.json">C configuration file</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is what it looks like:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const const name = &quot;Luke&quot;!
print(name)! // &quot;Luke&quot;"><pre><code>const const name = "Luke"!
print(name)! // "Luke"
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Please note:</strong> The above code will only highlight correctly if you have the extension installed.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Examples</h2>
<p dir="auto">For examples of C in action, check out the <a href="https://github.com/TodePond/C/blob/main/test/Examples.md">examples page</a>!</p>

<p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Abstract: The exponential dependence of resistivity on temperature 
in germanium is found to be a great big lie.  My careful theoretical modeling and painstaking experimentation reveal 1) that my equipment 
is crap, as are all the available texts on the subject and 2) that this whole exercise was a complete waste of my 
time.

<h3><u>Introduction</u></h3> 

<p> 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Electrons in germanium are confined to 
well-defined energy bands that are separated by "forbidden regions" of zero charge-carrier density.  You can 
read about it yourself if you want to, although I don't recommend it.  You'll have to wade through an obtuse, convoluted discussion about considering an arbitrary number of 
non-coupled harmonic-oscillator potentials and taking limits and so on.  The upshot is that if you heat up a sample of germanium, electrons will jump from a
non-conductive energy band to a conductive one, thereby creating a measurable change in resistivity.  This 
relation between temperature and resistivity can be shown to be exponential in certain temperature regimes 
by waving your hands and chanting "to first order".  
 </p>
<h3><u>Experiment procedure</u></h3> 

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I sifted through the box of germanium crystals and chose the one that appeared 
to be the least cracked.  Then I soldered wires onto the crystal in the spots shown in figure 2b of Lab Handout 
32.  Do you have any idea how hard it is to solder wires to germanium?  I'll tell you: real goddamn hard.  The 
solder simply won't stick, and you can forget about getting any of the grad students in the solid state labs to 
help you out. 
<br> 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Once the wires were in place, I attached them as appropriate to the second-rate  
equipment I scavenged from the back of the lab, none of which worked properly.  I soon wised up and swiped 
replacements from the well-stocked research labs.   This is how they treat undergrads around here: they give 
you broken tools and then don't understand why  you don't get any results.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  In order to control the temperature of the germanium, I attached the crystal to a 
copper rod, the upper end of which was attached to a heating coil and the lower end of which was dipped in 
a thermos of liquid nitrogen.   Midway through the project, the thermos began leaking.  That's right: I pay a cool ten grand a quarter to 
come here, and yet they can't spare the five bucks to ensure that I have a working thermos.

<h3><u>Results</u></h3> 

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Check this shit out (Fig. 1).  That's bonafide, 100%-real data, my friends.  I took it 
myself over the course of two weeks.  And this was not a leisurely two weeks, either; I busted my
ass day and night in order to provide you with nothing but the best data possible.   Now, let's look a bit more closely
at this data, remembering that it is absolutely first-rate.  Do you see the exponential dependence?  I sure don't.  I see a bunch of crap.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Christ, this was such a waste of my time. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Banking on my hopes that whoever grades this will just look at the pictures, I drew an 
exponential through my noise.  I believe the apparent legitimacy is enhanced by the fact that I used a complicated computer program
to make the fit.  I understand this is the same process by which the top quark was discovered.
</p>
<h3><u>Conclusion</u></h3> 

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Going into physics was the biggest mistake of my life.  I should've declared CS.  I still 
wouldn't have any women, but at least I'd be rolling in cash.
