            <pubDate>Sun, 24 Nov 2024 15:56:34 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://bitfieldconsulting.com/posts/career">https://bitfieldconsulting.com/posts/career</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42228538">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1667929911209_9668"><p>This isn’t about the time I inadvertently shut down one of Britain’s nuclear power stations, an entirely true story for which the world is nevertheless not yet prepared. Nor is it about the poor junior developer who <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6ez8ag/accidentally_destroyed_production_database_on/">accidentally destroyed the production database</a> on their first day (they’ll be fine, bless them).</p>
<p>Instead, I want to talk about another kind of career ending mistake, one that affects more than just the unlucky few. Indeed, it’s a mistake we’re probably all making right now. And that’s <em>not planning the end of our careers</em>.</p>
<h3 id="the-end">The end</h3>
<p>By “the end”, I don’t necessarily mean picking your retirement date. This is really about the aim or goal of your career. Where will you be when you realise that this is where you’ve always wanted to be?</p>
<p>If you love what you’re doing now and don’t ever want to change jobs, great: you’ve reached the end of your career, even if it plays out over many decades. If you don’t love it, though, and that’s much more likely, then it’s worth asking what job you <em>would</em> love, and how you’re going to get it.</p>
<p>So, where do you want to end up? And is that where you’re currently heading? If not, what should you do about it?</p>
<h3 id="out-of-control">Out of control</h3>
<p>The word “career” means, among other things, “to rush about wildly”, or, of a vehicle, “to move fast and in a way that is out of control”. Isn’t that apt? And doesn’t it describe the career experience of most of us pretty well?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The indispensable first step to getting what you want is this: decide what you want.</em><br>
 —Saying</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most of us, in fact, don’t really know what we want to do with our working lives until we’re more or less doing it. By the time we’ve made our minds up where we want to go, we may already be a long way down the wrong track.</p>
<p>It’s not surprising, then, that many of us find ourselves in less than fully satisfying jobs, with doubtful or non-existent prospects for advancement. In all honesty, if we <em>are</em> happy in our jobs, it’s probably more often a matter of luck than of design.</p>
<p>Maybe rather than rushing around wildly, we should give a little thought to what we want to achieve in our careers. Rather than just sit back and hope we get the career we want, maybe we should actively plan and take steps to bring it about.</p>
<p>As software engineers, we’re constantly making detailed, elaborate plans for computers to execute; that’s what software is, after all. Isn’t it kind of weird that we rarely give a moment’s thought to the program we want to write for ourselves?</p>
<h3 id="choose-your-destination">Choose your destination</h3>
<p>The best time to start a pension is always twenty years ago, and career planning is a bit like that, too. By the time you realise you need it, you usually wish you’d started a lot earlier. On the other hand, it would be foolish to let that prevent you from starting at all. Even a late, sketchy, and uncertain plan is way better than no plan.</p>
<p>So what would a career plan look like? And when should we start making it?</p>
<p>The first phase of your career is probably too early to make serious plans, and any decisions you make at this stage are rarely critical: there’s plenty of room to experiment and make mistakes.</p>
<p>In the final phase, by contrast, you have fewer options, and there’s not much time to pull off a significant change of direction. The autopilot tends to lock in and steer you further down the glide path you’re already on.</p>
<p>You should be planning, in other words, to enter the final phase of your career in the right position, at the right level, and at the right time to land where you want to. So where is that, exactly?</p>
<h3 id="three-kinds-of-careers">Three kinds of careers</h3>
<p>Your career is likely to encompass lots of different things. Over the years, you’ll do all sorts of different jobs at different companies, and the perfect career destination for you may end up being something you can’t even imagine right now.</p>
<p>To help us think about it, though, let’s divide the possibilities, very broadly, into three groups:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Seniority</li>
<li>Management</li>
<li>Independence</li>
</ol>
<p>In the rest of this article, we’ll take a closer look at each of these destination airports, check out the local weather conditions, and ask what kind of flight plan would get us there.</p>
<p>So, what kind of career do you want to have?</p>
</div><div data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1667929911209_12674"><h2 id="seniority">Seniority</h2>
<p>The first kind of career destination we’ll consider is <em>senior
individual contributor</em> (IC), which usually means something like
“high-level engineer”. A senior IC doesn’t run their own firm, or work
independently. They’re at the top of their game technically, and may be
a technical leader for others, but they spend the majority of their time
<em>doing</em> the work, not managing other people who do.</p>
<h3 id="what-does-a-senior-ic-do">What does a senior IC do?</h3>
<p>The exact ranks and job titles for senior engineers vary from one
company to the next, and there may be many levels for you to achieve
within a given company. But in terms of your <em>eventual</em> career
goal, let’s say we’re talking about the top level you can reach while
still being primarily an engineer.</p>
<p>In a small company, that might simply be something like “senior
developer”, or even team leader. In larger companies, the pinnacle of
engineering pay and responsibilities might be called something like
“principal engineer” or even “distinguished engineer” (sounds good,
doesn’t it?).</p>
<p>This isn’t an executive position: you won’t have your own washroom,
or a seat on the board. On the other hand, you’ll have plenty of money,
status, and authority, and unlike your colleagues in management, you
won’t spend all day in meetings. You’ll be at the highest level of your
profession, and getting well paid to excel at the work you love.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the
only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work.
And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.</em><br>
—Steve Jobs, <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2005/06/14/jobs-061505/">Stanford
commencement address</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="what-they-dont-do">What they don’t do</h3>
<p>There are a few limitations, though. You probably won’t get to choose
<em>what</em> to work on, and you may not agree with all the decisions
of the powers that be. In fact, it’s practically certain you won’t.
After all, you know more about the subject matter than they do. If, in
the end, you can’t live with those decisions, you can go work for
another company, but of course you’ll find the same dynamic there.</p>
<p>A senior IC role appeals to those who want to stay technical and keep
their hands on the keyboard, or at least the mouse. You don’t have the
time-consuming, cross-disciplinary responsibilities of a business owner,
or the political challenges of a manager. You get to do all the fun
stuff: the building and making. And you can do it until you choose to
retire—hopefully in financial comfort.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-get-there">How to get there</h3>
<p>Find out what the situation is where you work. If senior ICs are a
thing in your company, talk to them. Ask them for advice. How did they
get where they are? What were the steps along the way? And is it what
they thought it would be?</p>
<p>Talk to your boss. Do they know this is what you want? What are they
prepared to do to help you get it? And what will they expect from you in
return? Establishing this dialogue is important, but it’s not enough:
you need to keep it open throughout your employment. Check in with them
often on how you’re doing, and what more you can do to help them help
<em>you</em>.</p>
<p>Don’t wait for annual reviews. A year is too long to wait to find out
that you’ve made no progress towards your career goal. Some people
blithely assume that if they keep doing what they’re doing for long
enough and don’t screw up, they’ll eventually make senior IC.</p>
<p>Well, maybe. But a more reliable strategy is to take personal control
of your skills development, and start taking it seriously.</p>
<h3 id="seniority-means-mastery">Seniority means mastery</h3>
<p>The most senior engineers in any company are the most accomplished,
the most experienced, and those who have the most to teach others. If
you want to reach this level, you’ll need to become a master of your
chosen craft.</p>
<p>Don’t wait for the company to train you. They prefer to promote
people who don’t need training. Instead, once you’ve found the craft you
love, you’ll need to dedicate yourself to mastering it.</p>
<p>Start seeing your current work not as a simple exchange of your time
for their money, but rather as an opportunity to find out what you’re
good at, and to get better at it. A professional coach can help you
figure this out, support your learning, and keep your eye on the
ball.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Manhood is patience. Mastery is nine times patience.</em><br>
—Ursula K. Le Guin, <a href="https://amzn.to/3o7CwKW">“A Wizard of
Earthsea”</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="management">Management</h2>
<p>While very senior engineers can be well-compensated, their roles are
usually not the most senior in the <em>company</em>. If you want to rise
even higher in pay and responsibility while staying within the firm, you
may need to think about leaving your technical work behind and switching
to <em>management</em>.</p>
<p>Management is perhaps the default destination for many tech careers.
Provided you can stay in a company long enough, the natural path to
further advancement may be for you to become a manager.</p>
<p>If you don’t change direction, in other words, you may end up where
you’re heading. But <em>is</em> that where you want to go?</p>
<h3 id="what-does-a-manager-do">What does a manager do?</h3>
<p>Engineering managers need a solid foundation of technical competence,
to be sure, but the work itself is primarily about leading, supervising,
hiring, and developing the skills of other technical people. It turns
out those are all skills, too, and relatively rare ones.</p>
<p>Managing people is hard; much harder than programming. Computers just
do what you tell them, whether that’s right or wrong (usually wrong).
Anyone can get good at programming, if they’re willing to put in enough
time and effort. I’m not sure anyone can get good at managing, and most
don’t. Most managers are <em>terrible</em>.</p>
<p>That’s quite a sweeping statement, I know. (Prove me wrong, managers,
prove me wrong.) But, really, would a car mechanic last long in the job
if they couldn’t fit a tyre, or change a spark plug? Would a doctor
succeed if they regularly amputated the wrong leg? We would hope not.
But many managers are just as incompetent, in their own field, and yet
they seem to get away with it.</p>
<h3 id="being-a-great-manager">Being a great manager</h3>
<p>Good managers, then, like good teachers, are rare, but all the more
precious for it. If you’ve ever had a really good boss, you’ll remember
them all your life, and, if you’re lucky, emulate them. (You’ll remember
the really bad ones, too.) And just because managers don’t cut code or
solder chips, it doesn’t mean they don’t have a big influence on the
success of projects and companies.</p>
<p>Indeed, managers can have an outsize influence on events. I’m sure we
can all cite examples of promising projects that sank without trace
because of a disastrous manager. I’m less sure that there are many
examples of inspirational managers rescuing doomed projects from the
brink, though it does happen.</p>
<p>If you want to become a great manager, which I think is the only kind
worth being, start practising now. Learn people skills, communication,
collaboration, psychology. Work on understanding the things that make
different kinds of people tick. Manage <em>yourself</em> excellently. If
you can’t organise yourself, how do you expect to be responsible for a
team?</p>
<h3 id="getting-started">Getting started</h3>
<p>Study your own manager. If they do the job well, figure out why (and
talk to them about it). If they’re a shambles, figure out what they’re
doing wrong, and decide how you’d do better.</p>
<p>A great manager understands what’s happening with each person in
their team, and can be there to eliminate problems and roadblocks almost
before they happen. Why shouldn’t you start doing this kind of thing
right now, rather than waiting to be told? Sometimes the de facto leader
of a team is simply the person that everyone turns to when they have a
problem they can’t solve on their own. If that’s you, you may already be
on the road to becoming a memorable manager—for the right reasons.</p>
<h2 id="independence">Independence</h2>
<p>Being independent means working for yourself, most likely in your own
company, and maybe with others working for you, but also maybe not. Just
being a one-person company doesn’t necessarily make you truly
independent, though. For example, are you a consultant or a
contractor?</p>
<p>While the client tells a contractor what to do, a consultant tells
the <em>client</em> what to do. The difference matters. A consultant is
independent; a contractor is not.</p>
<h3 id="the-pros-and-cons-of-independent-working">The pros and cons of
independent working</h3>
<p>Running your own business, or otherwise being an independent worker,
is great for those who like it. I do, and I was never really happy
working for someone else. I couldn’t wait to strike out on my own. I was
probably a pretty mediocre employee for that reason, among others. And
there was the little <em>nuclear</em> incident, of course.</p>
<p>On the other hand, not everyone wants the hassle of figuring out how
to market their business and pitch clients, or the headache of handling
accounts and taxes. And not everyone can manage on an irregular,
unpredictable income, especially if they have a family to support. You
don’t get vacations, insurance, or sick pay. On the plus side, you own a
business.</p>
<h3 id="when-its-time-to-leave">When it’s time to leave</h3>
<p>If you do want to swap your stable job and decent salary for the joys
of career independence, the transition needs a little careful planning.
It would be unwise, for example, to just quit one day in a fit of pique,
<em>then</em> start wondering how you’re going to make rent the first
few months. Timing is important.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DENPOK: <em>Lao Tzu teaches: the best fighter is never angry. More
important than the blow is knowing <strong>when</strong> to strike.
Like, perhaps, after we experience the executive whitewater rafting trip
in Coeur d’Alene.</em><br>
—<a href="https://amzn.to/3uVthBs">“Silicon Valley”</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And to make money on your own, you’ll need to be <em>excellent</em>
at what you do. There’s no one else to pick up the slack. In a big
company, you can learn on the job. When you run your own company, you’d
better already know your trade.</p>
<h3 id="testing-the-waters">Testing the waters</h3>
<p>If you can make the time, it’s a good idea to dip your toe into
independent working by doing a few small, one-off side gigs. You’ll gain
experience and some satisfied clients, making it easier to go fully
independent when you want to. And if it turns out that you don’t enjoy
the experience of working for yourself, it’s better to find that out
<em>before</em> you rage-quit your job, isn’t it?</p>
<p>Of course, we don’t always leave our jobs through choice. Layoffs are
a fact of life in a volatile industry. You may not see the rocks coming;
companies tend to fail gradually, then suddenly. But an unexpected
transition to “funemployment” needn’t be a disaster. If you’ve always
dreamed of being independent but somehow never quite worked up the
courage to jump ship voluntarily, then being made to walk the plank
could be just the spur you need.</p>
<h2 id="making-the-choice">Making the choice</h2>
<p>I hope I’ve encouraged you to think about where your career is going,
where you <em>want</em> to go, and what you can do to get there. Of
course, you may not yet know how you want to spend the bulk of your
career. That’s okay, and completely normal.</p>
<p>But you can <em>think</em> about it, even if it’s too early to come
to any firm decisions. And you’re not limited to just <em>one</em> of
these potential destinations: many successful careers combine seniority,
management, and independence in some way.</p>
<p>For example, you could be a full-time or part-time manager, and also
run your own business on the side. Or you could achieve independence by
being a roving consultant within a large organisation, while still
technically being a senior engineer. Or you could combine all three by
being the chief executive <em>and</em> the director of engineering in
your own firm. There are many possibilities.</p>
<h3 id="figuring-out-who-you-are">Figuring out who you are</h3>
<p>You can inquire of yourself what things you value, and how your
working life could contribute to them. As your experience and knowledge
of the world grows, ideas may start to slot into place for you about
what you want to do and be.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Tell me, what is it you plan to do</em><br>
<em>With your one wild and precious life?</em><br>
—Mary Oliver, <a href="https://amzn.to/3uVsUGY">“The Summer Day”</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your future may not, in fact, lie in the tech industry. That’s all
right, too. I have more than one friend who, despite achieving
considerable success as an engineer, has decided that this isn’t really
what they want to do in the long term.</p>
<p>If you want to quit and be a doctor instead, or a schoolteacher, a <a href="https://xkcd.com/2124/">spaaaaaace</a> engineer, a woodworker, or
simply wander the world like a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7YDcLP2DeY">badass</a> righting
wrongs, go to it. <a href="https://bitfieldconsulting.com/posts/time-lords">Don’t waste any more of
your one wild and precious life</a> careering down a blind alley.</p>
<h3 id="making-small-course-corrections">Making small course
corrections</h3>
<p>Once you do have a sense of where you want to go, it can help guide
your choices. Even if you don’t know exactly what your perfect job looks
like, you may start to feel that you won’t be truly happy until you’re
independent, or a senior IC, or a manager. You can steer away from
things that would limit your options in those areas, and instead seek
out companies, fields, or sectors where you’ll have the best chance of
achieving the career you want.</p>
<p>That’s not to say you should have a detailed map of every step that
you plan to take (“make junior VP by Q4 2035”). As engineers, we already
know that a too-rigid plan rarely survives contact with reality.
Instead, assume life will throw all kinds of crazy and unexpected things
at you. Plan to be flexible, and to change your plans.</p>
<h3 id="its-about-the-planning-not-the-plan">It’s about the planning,
not the plan</h3>
<p>You can’t stop the waves, as the saying goes, but you can <a href="https://bitfieldconsulting.com/posts/tao-of-go">learn to surf</a>. Chance favours the prepared
mind. Never underestimate the role of serendipity. The perfect
opportunity may show up just when you least expect it, but if you’ve
never thought about what you want, how will you recognise it?</p>
<p>The time to start planning for the end of your career is now. It’s
never too early, and it’s also never too late, provided, of course, that
you don’t have your own little <em>incident</em>. <a href="https://bitfieldconsulting.com/books/code">Let’s be careful out there</a>.</p>

On Friday, they decided that they were wrong to take up the case in the first place.</p><p>The high court dismissed the company’s appeal, leaving in place an appellate ruling allowing the case to go forward.</p><p>Investors allege that Meta did not fully disclose the risks that <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/c8f615be9523421998b4fcc16374ff37">Facebook users’ personal information would be misused</a></span> by Cambridge Analytica, a firm that supported <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a></span> ’s first successful Republican presidential campaign in 2016.</p><p>Inadequacy of the disclosures led to two significant price drops in the price of the company’s shares in 2018, after the public learned about the extent of the privacy scandal, the investors say.</p>
    

<p>Meta spokesman Andy Stone said the company was disappointed by the court’s action. “The plaintiff’s claims are baseless and we will continue to defend ourselves as this case is considered by the District Court,” Stone said in an emailed statement.</p>



<p> Meta already has paid a $5.1 billion fine and reached a $725 million privacy settlement with users.</p><div data-module="" data-gtm-region="What to know about Trump's second term: Staffing the administration: Here are the people Trump has picked for key positions so far.

<p>Cambridge Analytica had ties to Trump political strategist <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/steve-bannon">Steve Bannon</a></span>. It had paid a Facebook app developer for access to the personal information of about 87 million Facebook users. That data was then used to target U.S. voters during the 2016 campaign.</p>
    
    
    
<p>The lawsuit is one of two high court cases involving class-action lawsuits against tech companies. The justices also are wrestling with whether to shut down a class action against <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/nvidia-market-value-stock-price-revenue-chips-fe1d0d081191d5168332bf1c9ea3b85f">Nvidia</a></span>. Investors say the company misled them about its dependence on selling computer chips for the mining of volatile cryptocurrency. </p>

Here's an example from <b>Horizon 3</b>:</p><p><img src="https://www.tyleo.com/img/forza-horizon-3-de4ab5d4.webp"></p><p>Inspired by this design, I've always wanted to create a similar effect using HTML. On this page, I share my attempt at achieving a beautiful glass effect, along with sample code and assets for anyone who wants to explore this technique themselves.

Many guides stop here, but there's room for improvement! Right now, our glass looks flat and boring. Real glass has an interesting visual character around its edges that we're missing. Let's bring that to life.</p><h4>Edges</h4><p>First we'll add edges to our glass. Others, like<!-- --> <a href="https://css.glass/">css.glass</a>, do this using<!-- --> <span><span>border</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>px</span><span> solid</span></span>. Borders affect the element's size and how it interacts with children. I prefer using<!-- --> <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow"><span><span>box-shadow</span><span>:</span><span> inset</span></span></a>. By using <span><span>box-shadow</span><span>:</span><span> inset</span></span> the children seamlessly fill the content area of the glass without negative<!-- --> <span><span>margin</span></span>s or other magic. This allows them to behave like decals applied to the glass surface.</p><p><span><span>box-shadow</span></span> requires at least two size values and supports up to four. The first two define the shadow's x and y offsets. To mimic the edges of glass, we use two translucent white<!-- --> <span><span>box-shadow</span></span>s.</p><p>The first shadow represents the edge of the glass as seen from outside. In our example this appears along the bottom and left edges. The second shadow represents the edge as seen through the glass. In our example this appears along the top and right edges.</p><p>Since light diminishes when viewing the edge through the glass, the top and left edges are softer and more translucent compared to the bottom and right edges. This subtle difference creates the illusion that the glass is slightly elevated at the bottom-right corner.</p><div><pre>1

But another key characteristic of glass is its ability to <i>reflect</i> light off its surface. This reflective quality is the secret sauce to give our glass a distinctive look from other HTML glass examples.</p><h4>Rays of Light</h4><p>We'll blend in a image of light rays to create this effect. If you're interested in creating a similar image yourself, there are plenty of tutorials online. Here's one from<!-- --> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwgkK6PUkQ4">YouTube</a>, and here's<!-- --> <a href="https://phlearn.com/tutorial/light-rays-levels-photoshop/">a detailed textual walkthrough</a> <!-- -->if you prefer that approach. Alternatively, you can use download and use these light rays I created:</p><p><img src="https://www.tyleo.com/img/light-f71eeaec.png"></p><p>We'll explore a few ways to blend this image into the background. The first is to set it as the <span><span>background-image</span></span> of our glass element. Doing this directly on the element causes the<!-- --> <span><span>box-filter</span></span> to blur the<!-- --> <span><span>background-image</span></span>—we don't want that. Instead, we can apply the <span><span>background-image</span></span> to a pseudo child element using<!-- --> <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::before"><span><span>:</span><span>:</span><span>before</span></span></a>.</p><div><pre>1

In reality, moving glass through light creates dynamic reflections as the light shifts across the glass surface. Unfortunately, replicating this effect across all browsers is challenging.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-section="cdc_news_body" id="content">
	<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed a human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) (H5N1 bird flu) in a child in California. This is the first reported avian influenza H5 virus infection in a child in the United States. Consistent with previously identified human cases in the United States, the child reportedly experienced mild symptoms and received flu antivirals. There were low levels of viral material detected in the initial specimen collected, and follow-up testing of the child several days later was negative for H5 bird flu but was positive for other common respiratory viruses. The child is recovering from their illness. An investigation by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) into the child's possible H5N1 exposure source is ongoing. </p>
<p>During CDPH's investigation, all household members reported having symptoms and specimens were collected from those people. All test results from members of the household were negative for H5 bird flu, and some family members were positive for the same common respiratory viruses as the child. Contact tracing continues, but there is currently no evidence of person-to-person spread of H5N1 bird flu from this child to others. To date, there has been no person-to-person spread identified associated with any of the H5N1 bird flu cases reported in the United States.</p>
<p>This case was detected through influenza testing and reported to CDPH through influenza surveillance. This is the second U.S. case identified through national surveillance. CDC continues to closely monitor available data from <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/">influenza surveillance systems</a>, particularly in states affected by outbreaks in animals, including California, where widespread outbreaks of H5N1 bird flu have been detected in wild birds and domestic poultry since 2022 and dairy herds since August 2024 in that state.</p>
<p>Limited and sporadic human infections with avian influenza H5N1 virus, where animal exposure was not identified, are very uncommon but have occurred, primarily in countries other than the United States. These instances underscore the importance of ongoing surveillance and investigations at the local, state, and Federal levels. Including this most recent case, 55 human cases of H5 bird flu have now been reported in the United States during 2024, with 29 in California. </p>
<p>CDC's risk assessment for the general public is low. However, people with exposure to infected or potentially infected animals, such as birds, dairy cattle, or other animals (including livestock), or to environments contaminated by infected birds or other animals, are at higher risk of infection. CDC recommends avoiding unprotected exposures to sick or dead animals, including wild birds, poultry, other domesticated birds, and other wild or domesticated animals (including cows).</p>
<p>CDC will continue to provide updates as additional information becomes available. For more information, read California's statement <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR24-037.aspx" rel="noreferrer" data-domain-ext="gov">State Reports Single, Possible Case of Bird Flu Virus in Child with Mild Symptoms<span aria-label=" external icon" role="img"></span></a></p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Prerequisites</h2><a id="user-content-prerequisites" aria-label="Permalink: Prerequisites" href="#prerequisites"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The following packages are needed to run bocker.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>btrfs-progs</li>
<li>curl</li>
<li>iproute2</li>
<li>iptables</li>
<li>libcgroup-tools</li>
<li>util-linux &gt;= 2.25.2</li>
<li>coreutils &gt;= 7.5</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Because most distributions do not ship a new enough version of util-linux you will probably need to grab the sources from <a href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/v2.25/" rel="nofollow">here</a> and compile it yourself.</p>
<p dir="auto">Additionally your system will need to be configured with the following:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>A btrfs filesystem mounted under <code>/var/bocker</code></li>
<li>A network bridge called <code>bridge0</code> and an IP of 10.0.0.1/24</li>
<li>IP forwarding enabled in <code>/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward</code></li>
<li>A firewall routing traffic from <code>bridge0</code> to a physical interface.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">For ease of use a Vagrantfile is included which will build the needed environment.</p>
<p dir="auto">Even if you meet the above prerequisites you probably still want to <strong>run bocker in a virtual machine</strong>. Bocker runs as root and among other things needs to make changes to your network interfaces, routing table, and firewall rules. <strong>I can make no guarantees that it won't trash your system</strong>.</p>

              <p>What appears to be evidence of some of the oldest alphabetic writing in human history is etched onto finger-length, clay cylinders excavated from a tomb in Syria by a team of Johns Hopkins University researchers.</p>

<p>The writing, which is dated to around 2400 BCE, precedes other known alphabetic scripts by roughly 500 years, upending what archaeologists know about where alphabets came from, how they are shared across societies, and what that could mean for early urban civilizations, according to the researchers.</p>

<p>"Alphabets revolutionized writing by making it accessible to people beyond royalty and the socially elite. Alphabetic writing changed the way people lived, how they thought, how they communicated," said <a href="https://neareast.jhu.edu/directory/glenn-m-schwartz/">Glenn Schwartz</a>, a professor of archaeology at Johns Hopkins University who discovered the clay cylinders. "And this new discovery shows that people were experimenting with new communication technologies much earlier and in a different location than we had imagined before now."</p>

<p>Schwartz will share details of his discovery on Thursday, Nov. 21, at the <a href="https://www.asor.org/am/">American Society of Overseas Research's Annual Meeting</a>.</p>

<p>A Near Eastern archaeologist, Schwartz studies how early urban areas developed throughout Syria and how smaller cities emerged in the region. With colleagues from the University of Amsterdam, he co-directed a 16-year-long archaeological dig at Tell Umm-el Marra, one of the first medium-size urban centers that popped up in western Syria.</p>

<p>At Umm-el Marra, the archaeologists uncovered tombs dating back to the Early Bronze Age. One of the best-preserved tombs contained six skeletons, gold and silver jewelry, cookware, a spearhead, and intact pottery vessels. Next to the pottery, the researchers found four lightly baked clay cylinders with what seems to be alphabetic writing on them.</p>

<p>"The cylinders were perforated, so I'm imagining a string tethering them to another object to act as a label. Maybe they detail the contents of a vessel, or maybe where the vessel came from, or who it belonged to," Schwartz said. "Without a means to translate the writing, we can only speculate."</p>

<p>Using carbon-14 dating techniques, researchers confirmed the ages of the tombs, the artifacts, and the writing.</p>

<p>"Previously, scholars thought the alphabet was invented in or around Egypt sometime after 1900 BCE," Schwartz said. "But our artifacts are older and from a different area on the map, suggesting the alphabet may have an entirely different origin story than we thought."</p>
