    <p>Back in the day, advertising legend Bill Bernbach said, “The most powerful element in advertising is the truth.”</p>
<p>Let’s tell the truth, then: Nobody reads your blog.</p>
<p>At least, not as many as you’d like. Maybe a handful, maybe none. You pour your thoughts into it, craft each sentence, pick the right image — then silence. No likes, no shares, no engagement.</p>
<p>So what’s the point?</p>
<p>There’s two lies we tell ourselves:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>If I write it, they will come.</em> They won’t. There are billions of blog posts out there. The internet is an infinite void, and your blog is a whisper in a hurricane.</li>
<li>If nobody reads it, it’s a waste of time.</li>
</ol>
<p>Is it, though?</p>
<p>There is a hidden value in blogging.
There’s an old Zen saying: “Chop wood, carry water.” You do it not for the applause but because it needs doing.</p>
<p>Blogging forces clarity. It makes you structure your thoughts, sharpen your perspective. You stop writing fluff because — let’s be honest — you’re writing for yourself. And if you can’t keep yourself interested, nobody else stands a chance.</p>
<p>When you write, you think better. When you think better, you create better.</p>
<p>So, who’s there real audience?</p>
<p>You’re not just writing for today’s invisible audience. You’re writing for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Future you. Your posts become a time capsule of your evolving mind.</li>
<li>One right person. Maybe one day, someone stumbles across your words at exactly the right moment. And that changes something for them.</li>
<li>The work itself. Consistency beats virality. A hundred posts with depth will outlast a single viral hit.</li>
</ul>
<p>And there’s another thing. My other passion is street photography. Which is a bit like blogging.</p>
<p>You walk through the city, camera in hand. You see a scene — a moment of light, shadow, humanity. You capture it.</p>
<p>Nobody cares.</p>
<p>But that’s not why you did it. You did it because you saw something.</p>
<p>Like blogging. You write because you think, because you observe, because you need to put it somewhere.</p>
<p>If someone reads it? Bonus. If not? The work still got done.</p>
<p>And that’s the real point.</p>

<p>Two months after UnitedHealthcare's CEO was murdered, the insurer is moving to protect its image    </p>
	</div><div><p>
	Two months after the <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/unitedhealthcare-ceo-shooting-details-emerge-everything-to-know-1235193146/">killing</a> of <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/unitedhealthcare/">UnitedHealthcare</a> CEO Brian Thompson sent shockwaves through the <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/political-commentary/luigi-mangione-unitedhealthcare-health-care-scam-1235214858/">much-reviled U.S. health insurance industry</a>, the company’s parent, UnitedHealth Group, is making aggressive moves to protect its image.</p>



<p>
	Responding to a slew of attacks online, often coupled with the glorification of <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/luigi-mangione/">Luigi Mangione</a> (who was charged with Thompson’s murder outside a Midtown Manhattan hotel in December, and allegedly wrote a short manifesto calling health insurers “parasites”), the company has hired a law firm that specializes in defamation cases. Clare Locke, the Virginia-based practice, previously represented Dominion Voting Systems in a bombshell defamation suit that saw Fox News pay a settlement of <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/foxs-primetime-hosts-dominion-settlement-1234717513/">$787.5 million</a> for airing false allegations about the company’s supposed role in voter fraud during the 2020 election.</p>



<p>
	UnitedHealth appears eager to make a similar example of Elisabeth Potter, an Austin, Texas, plastic surgeon, and is accusing the doctor of “using her social media following to perpetuate inaccuracies, which is irresponsible, unethical and dangerous.” On Jan. 7, Potter posted a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DEid-1npNbA/?hl=en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">video</a> on <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/instagram/">Instagram</a> sharing her frustration with the U.S. insurance system, explaining in a text caption that during a procedure, “I was interrupted by a call from United Healthcare — while the patient was already asleep on the operating table. They demanded information about her diagnosis and inpatient stay justification. I had to scrub out mid-surgery to call United, only to find that the person on the line didn’t even have access to the patient’s full medical information, despite the procedure already being pre-approved.” 

	</p>




<p>
	“It’s beyond frustrating and, frankly, unacceptable,” Potter continued. “We should be focused on care, not bureaucracy.” The comments were rife with fury at UniteHealthcare and for-profit health insurance more broadly. “Luigi for President,” wrote one person, while another put in, “One day these health insurance companies will be dead.”

<p>
	Days later, according to reporting from <em><a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/unitedhealth-hires-defamation-firm-to-counter-social-media-posts" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a></em>, Potter’s attorney received a letter from Clare Locke instructing her to amend the post, apologize, and disavow threats of violence that UnitedHealth claimed had stemmed from the video. But Potter’s legal counsel, Jessica Underwood, has said that there is nothing inaccurate in the video that needs correcting. “Dr. Potter will not be silenced by UnitedHealthcare’s attempts to threaten and harass her,” Underwood has said. The company, meanwhile, has argued that “Dr. Potter’s claims that she was called out of surgery are false.” Potter’s Instagram video remains up on the platform, where it has received more than 350,000 likes.

	</p>




<p>
	Elsewhere, UnitedHealth took measures to prevent the dissemination of internal data about its denials of customer claims. (UnitedHealth Group’s individual market plans are known to have one of the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.startribune.com/unitedhealth-group-two-blues-plans-had-highest-denial-rates-for-aca-health-plans-in-2023/601212605" target="_blank">highest denial rates</a> among all U.S. insurers, a fact that received much media attention in the wake of Thompson’s death.) As <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.levernews.com/amazon-and-unitedhealths-inaugural-demands-post/" target="_blank">The Lever reported</a>, a day after <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/donald-trump/">President Donald Trump</a>‘s inauguration in January, UnitedHealth submitted a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.sec.gov/files/corpfin/no-action/14a-8/muellerunitedhealth12125-14a8inc.pdf" target="_blank">letter</a> to the Securities and Exchange Commission asking for approval to block a shareholder proposal that it use a third-party auditor to assess “previous customer denial claims, particularly where a death was involved, to determine if denial letters included factually incorrect and insensitive information.” In cases where this outside analyst determined that a coverage claim should not have been denied, the proposal says, those individuals and family members affected are to be sent an apology letter hand-signed by both a UnitedHealth executive and a member of the company’s board of directors.</p>



<p>
	UnitedHealth’s rationale for refusing a vote on such a policy, as its legal team wrote in the letter, is that the proposal was not submitted before “the applicable deadline.”</p>



<p>
	Then, on Jan. 31, the insurer sent a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.sec.gov/files/corpfin/no-action/14a-8/durocherunitedhealth13125-14a8inc.pdf" target="_blank">second letter</a> to the SEC, seeking to prevent a shareholder vote on another proposal related to its claim denials. This proposal, if passed by investors, would recommend that UnitedHealth “evaluate how company practices impact access to <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/health-care/" id="auto-tag_health-care" data-tag="health-care">health care</a> and patient outcomes, including analyses of how often prior authorization requirements or denials of coverage lead to delay or abandonment of medical treatment and serious adverse events for patients.” The report produced through this review is also intended to encompass “the public health-related costs and macroeconomic risks created by the company’s practices that limit or delay access to health care.”

<p>
	In their letter, UniteHealth rejected the notion of putting this proposal to a shareholder vote because it is “vague and indefinite,” and, it argued, an attempt to “impermissibly micromanage” the company.</p>



<p>
	The insurance giant’s attempts to police social media chatter about its business practices and its overtures to Trump’s SEC dovetailed earlier this week when hedge fund billionaire <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/bill-ackman-wife-guy-harvard-claudine-gay-1234943020/">Bill Ackman</a> shared his opinion of the company’s future. “If I still shorted stocks, I would short United Healthcare,” he posted to X on Tuesday, adding that the SEC “should do a thorough investigation of the company.” He further mused, “I would not be surprised to find that the company’s profitability is massively overstated due to its denial of medically necessary procedures and patient care.” 

</p>



<p>
	Ackman later deleted the speculation, but UnitedHealth <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ae98e904-748b-4012-b36f-b5c323de4317" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">flagged his comments to the SEC</a> for potential investigation. The company’s stock price dipped the following day, and ended the week about 2.7 percent lower than it was on Tuesday. “Health insurance has long been subject to significant regulatory oversight and earnings caps,” UnitedHealth said in a statement responding to the outspoken investor, one of many ultra-wealthy figures to back Trump in 2024 and post prolifically on social media about how only the MAGA movement could save the country. “Any claims that health insurers, which typically have low- to mid-single digit margins, can somehow over-earn are grossly uninformed about the structure and strong regulatory oversight of the sector,” the company noted.

	</p>




<p>
	All told, UnitedHealth is mounting a far stronger defense of its reputation than it two months ago, when Thompson’s slaying unleashed a flood of hostility that caught it somewhat off-guard. Now, the company looks like it’s prepared to grind it out as Mangione’s parallel state and federal trials get underway, with heated rhetoric likely to flare up once again.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>We present a fundamental discovery that challenges our understanding of how complex reasoning emerges in large language models. While conventional wisdom suggests that sophisticated reasoning tasks demand extensive training data (&gt;100,000 examples), we demonstrate that complex mathematical reasoning abilities can be effectively elicited with surprisingly few examples. Through comprehensive experiments, our proposed model LIMO demonstrates unprecedented performance in mathematical reasoning. With merely 817 curated training samples, LIMO achieves 57.1% accuracy on AIME and 94.8% on MATH, improving from previous SFT-based models' 6.5% and 59.2% respectively, while only using 1% of the training data required by previous approaches. LIMO demonstrates exceptional out-of-distribution generalization, achieving 40.5% absolute improvement across 10 diverse benchmarks, outperforming models trained on 100x more data, challenging the notion that SFT leads to memorization rather than generalization. Based on these results, we propose the Less-Is-More Reasoning Hypothesis (LIMO Hypothesis): In foundation models where domain knowledge has been comprehensively encoded during pre-training, sophisticated reasoning capabilities can emerge through minimal but precisely orchestrated demonstrations of cognitive processes. This hypothesis posits that the elicitation threshold for complex reasoning is determined by two key factors: (1) the completeness of the model's encoded knowledge foundation during pre-training, and (2) the effectiveness of post-training examples as "cognitive templates" that show the model how to utilize its knowledge base to solve complex reasoning tasks. To facilitate reproducibility and future research in data-efficient reasoning, we release LIMO as a comprehensive open-source suite at <a href="https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/LIMO" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.

          <!-- RSPEAK_START -->

        <p>Recently, many online retailers have sent out Seagate hard disks as new that have already been running somewhere <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Gebrauchte-Seagate-Festplatten-als-Neuware-im-Umlauf-10254276.html?from-en=1">for many</a>, <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Betrug-mit-Seagate-Festplatten-Dutzende-Leser-melden-Verdachtsfaelle-10258657.html?from-en=1">many</a> <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Festplatten-Betrug-Weitere-Haendler-betroffen-erste-Ruecknahmen-10264019.html?from-en=1">hours.</a> As yet unknown fraudsters had reset the SMART values of used drives and smuggled them back into distribution via equally unknown channels. Official Seagate dealers are also affected.</p>

    
  

  <!-- RSPEAK_STOP -->
  
  <a-paternoster height="360" media="(min-width: 320px) and (max-width: 767px)">
    

  

  </a-paternoster>
  <!-- RSPEAK_START -->



<p>However, Seagate server hard disks also log their runtimes and other parameters elsewhere: The so-called FARM values cannot (yet?) be reset by the fraudsters (FARM stands for Field Accessible Reliability Metrics). These can also be read out with the <a href="https://www.heise.de/download/product/smartmontools-56954">smartmontools</a> or the <a href="https://www.seagate.com/de/de/support/downloads/seatools/" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">Seagate Seatools</a>. According to the readers, the affected drives have been in operation for an average of around 25,000 hours.</p>
<h3 id="nav_cases_from_all__0">Cases from all over the world</h3>
<p>However, not only German customers are affected. We have received reports from Switzerland, Austria, Luxembourg, the UK, the Czech Republic and the USA. The online retailer East Digital from Hong Kong is also said to be sending out such drives. They have now sold out of the drives, but apparently they often have such “special offers” in their program. We have also seen forum entries from Australian East Digital customers who are now also experiencing long FARM runtimes.</p>
<p>We have also received reports from Japan that the case is being reported there. We are happy to receive further information <a href="mailto:ll@ct.de?subject=Festplatten-Betrug">by e-mail</a> –. If you prefer to remain anonymous, you can do so via our <a href="https://www.heise.de/investigativ/">anonymous mailbox</a>.</p>
<h3 id="nav_slabs_from_chia__1">Slabs from chia farms?</h3>
<p>Where the slabs came from and how they got to Germany is still unclear. However, many such used drives are said to be on sale in China at the moment. These could come from former <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Kryptowaehrung-Chia-2-Exabyte-ueberschritten-und-erstmalig-handelbar-6037645.html?from-en=1">computing farms for the cryptocurrency Chia</a>, which are now being shut down as farming such coins is no longer profitable: The energy costs are now higher than the expected profit.</p>

  





<p>The available storage space in this network was initially <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Kryptowaehrung-Chia-verursacht-Lieferprobleme-in-Asien-6045592.html?from-en=1">only a few exabytes</a>, but later rose sharply. Since the summer of 2024, the storage space in the Chia network has been decreasing, from around 34 exabytes at the time to around 19 exabytes now. The loss of around 15 exabytes corresponds to around one million hard disks with a gross capacity of 16 TByte. Not all of these will come from Seagate; however, the manufacturer currently has a share of more than 40 percent of the hard disk market. Roughly speaking, more than 400,000 used Seagate drives with 16 TByte could have been discarded from the Chia farms.</p>


  



  





<p>The message from an affected person in a forum fits in with this. When asked, Seagate stated that his hard disk was originally sold to a Chinese company from Mongolia. Seagate's German representative is not so forthcoming about the origin of the drives, citing data protection and assuring that the company is not involved in the scam.</p>
<h3 id="nav_warranty_far__2">Warranty far too short</h3>
<p>Some of the disks still have a few months of warranty left, but most of them have long since expired. Many were sold as part of a larger system – and therefore as so-called OEM disks, for which the manufacturer provides no warranty. If they were sold in a Dell system, for example, then Dell is responsible for the warranty processing in this system, it is effectively no longer a Seagate disk.</p>


<!-- RSPEAK_STOP -->

<!-- RSPEAK_START -->

<p>Many of our readers have complained, even long before these cases of fraud, about the practice of dealers selling OEM disks without a manufacturer's warranty. We therefore recommend that you visit the warranty inquiries of the dealers immediately after receiving a drive and check the status <a href="https://www.seagate.com/de/de/support/warranty-and-replacements/" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">(Seagate</a>, <a href="https://www.storrepair.com/toshiba_products/" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">Toshiba</a>, <a href="https://support-de.wd.com/app/Warranty_Status" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">Western Digital</a>). The serial number is sometimes already noted on the invoice and can otherwise be read through the anti-static packaging before it is opened; this also allows the production date to be identified. If this is several years in the past, caution is advised and a return is at least worth considering.</p>

<h3>Intro</h3><hr><p>
In this article I want to correct a popular misconception that's been making the rounds in computer graphics aficionado circles for a long time now. It has to do with branching in the GPUs. Unfortunately there are a couple of educational websites out there that are spreading some misinformation and it would be nice correcting that. I tried contacting the authors without success, so without further ado, here goes my attempt to fix things up:</p><h3>The issue</h3><hr><p>
So, say I have this code, which I actually published the other day:</p><p><span>vec2</span> snap45( <span>in vec2</span> v )
{
    <span>vec2</span> s = <span>sign</span>(v);
    <span>float</span> x = <span>abs</span>(v.x);
    <span>return</span> x&gt;<span>0.923880</span>?<span>vec2</span>(s.x,<span>0.0</span>):
           x&gt;<span>0.382683</span>?s*<span>sqrt</span>(<span>0.5</span>):
                      <span>vec2</span>(<span>0.0</span>,s.y);
}</p>
<p>
The exact details of what it does don't matter for this discussion. All we care about is the two ternary operations, which as you know, implement conditional execution. Indeed, depending on the value of the variable <b>x</b>, the function will return different results. This could be implemented also with regular <b>if</b> statements, and all that I'm going to say stays the same.</p><p>

But here's the problem - when seeing code like this, somebody somewhere will invariably propose the following "optimization", which replaces what they believe (erroneously) are "conditional branches" by arithmetical operations. They will suggest something like this:</p><p><span>vec2</span> snap45( <span>in vec2</span> v )
{
    <span>vec2</span> s = <span>sign</span>(v);
    <span>float</span> x = <span>abs</span>(v.x);

    <span>float</span> w0 = <span>step</span>(<span>0.92387953</span>,x);
    <span>float</span> w1 = <span>step</span>(<span>0.38268343</span>,x)*(<span>1.0</span>-w0);
    <span>float</span> w2 = <span>1.0</span>-w0-w1;

    <span>vec2</span> res0 = <span>vec2</span>(s.x,<span>0.0</span>);
    <span>vec2</span> res1 = <span>vec2</span>(s.x,s.y)*<span>sqrt</span>(<span>0.5</span>);
    <span>vec2</span> res2 = <span>vec2</span>(<span>0.0</span>,s.y);

    <span>return</span> w0*res0 + w1*res1 + w2*res2;
}</p>
<p>
There are two things wrong with this practice. The first one shows an incorrect understanding of how the GPU works. In particular, the original shader code had no conditional branching in it. Selecting between a few registers with a ternary operator or with a plain <b>if</b> statement does not lead to conditional branching; all it involves is a conditional move (a.k.a. "select"), which is a simple instruction to route the correct bits to the destination register. You can think of it as a bitwise AND+NAND+OR on the source registers, which is a simple combinational circuit. Again, there is no branching - the instruction pointer isn't manipulated, there's no branch prediction involved, no instruction cache to invalidation, no nothing.</p><p>

For the record, of course real branches do happen in GPU code, but those are not what's used by the GPU for small moves between registers like we have here. This is true for any GPU made in the last 20+ years. While I'm not an expert in CPUs, I am pretty sure this is true for them as well.</p><p>

The second wrong thing with the supposedly optimizer version is that it actually runs much slower than the original version. The reason is that the <b>step()</b> function is actually implemented like this:</p><p><span>float</span> step( <span>float</span> x, <span>float</span> y )
{
    <span>return</span> x &lt; y ? <span>1.0</span> : <span>0.0</span>;
}</p>
<p>
So people using the step() "optimization" are using the ternary operation anyways, which produces the <b>0.0</b> or <b>1.0</b> which they will use to select the output, only wasting two multiplications and one or two additions. The values could have been conditionally moved directly, which is what the original shader code did.</p><p>

But don't take my word for it, let's look at the generated machine code for the relevant part of the shader I published:</p><div>

<div><p>
GLSL</p><hr>
<p><span>return</span> x&gt;<span>0.923880</span>?<span>vec2</span>(s.x,<span>0.0</span>):
       x&gt;<span>0.382683</span>?s*<span>sqrt</span>(<span>0.5</span>):
                  <span>vec2</span>(<span>0.0</span>,s.y);</p>
</div>
<div><p>
AMD Compiler</p><hr>
<p><span>s_mov_b32</span>     s0, <span>0x3ec3ef15</span>
<span>v_mul_f32</span>     v3, <span>0x3f3504f3</span>, v1
<span>v_mul_f32</span>     v4, <span>0x3f3504f3</span>, v0
<span>s_mov_b32</span>     s1, <span>0x3f6c835e</span>
<span>v_cmp_gt_f32</span>  vcc, <span>abs</span>(v2), s0
<span>v_cndmask_b32</span> v3, 0, v3, vcc
<span>v_cndmask_b32</span> v0, v0, v4, vcc
<span>v_cmp_ngt_f32</span> vcc, <span>abs</span>(v2), s1
<span>v_cndmask_b32</span> v1, v1, v3, vcc
<span>v_cndmask_b32</span> v0, 0, v0, vcc</p>
</div>
<div><p>
Microsoft Compiler</p><hr>
<p><span>lt</span>   r0.xy, l(<span>0</span>, <span>0</span>), v0.xy
<span>lt</span>   r0.zw, v0.xy, l(<span>0</span>, <span>0</span>)
<span>iadd</span> r0.xy, -r0.xyxx, r0.zwzz
<span>itof</span> r0.xy, r0.xyxx
<span>mul</span>  r1.xyzw, r0.xyxy, l4(<span>0.707107</span>)
<span>lt</span>   r2.xy, l(<span>0.923880</span>,<span>0.382683</span>), <span>|</span>v0.xx<span>|</span>
<span>mov</span>  r0.z, l(<span>0</span>)
<span>movc</span> r1.xyzw, r2.yyyy, r1.xyzw, r0.zyzy
<span>movc</span> o0.xyzw, r2.xxxx, r0.xzxz, r1.xyzw</p>
</div>
</div><p>
Here we can see that the GPU is not branching. Instead, according to the AMD compiler, it's performing the required comparisons (<span>v_cmp_gt_f32</span> and <span>v_cmp_ngt_f32</span> - cmp=compare, gt=greater than, ngt=not greated than), and then using the result to mask the results with the bitwise operations mentioned earlier (<span>v_cndmask_b32</span> - cnd=conditional).</p><p>

The Microsoft compiler has expressed the same idea/implementation in a different format, but you can still see the comparison (<span>lt</span> - "lt"=less than) and the masking or conditional move (<span>movc</span> - mov=move, c=conditionally).</p><p>

Not related to the discussion, but also note that the <b>abs()</b> call does not become a GPU instruction and instead becomes an instruction modifier, which is free.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><hr>
<p>
So, if you ever see somebody proposing this</p><p><span>float</span> a = <span>mix</span>( b, c, <span>step</span>( y, x ) );</p><p>
as an optimization to</p><p><span>float</span> a = x &lt; y ? b : c</p><p>
then please correct them for me. The misinformation has been around for 20 years / 10 GPU generation, and that's more than too long.</p><p>

Thanks!
