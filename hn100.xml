The most vital question everybody’s asking themselves is: What’s up with all those equals signs?!</p><p>And that’s something I’m somewhat of an expert on.  I mean, having written mail readers and stuff; not because I’ve been to Caribbean islands.</p><p>I’ve seen people confidently claim that it’s a code, or that it’s an artefact of scanning and then using OCR, but it’s neither — it’s just that whoever converted these emails to a readable format were morons.</p><p>What’s that you say?  “Converted?!  Surely emails are just text!!”  Well, if you lived in the stone age (i.e., the 80s), they mostly were, but then people invented things like “long lines” and “rock döts”, and computers had to “encode” the mail before sending.</p><p>The artefact we see here is from something called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quoted-printable" data-cached-time="2026-02-02T21:39:18" data-cached-image="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/cache-2026-02-02-web.webp" onmouseenter="hoverLink(event)">“quoted printable”</a>, or as we used to call it when it was introduced: “Quoted unreadable”.</p><p>To take the first line.  Whoever wrote this, typed in the following in their mail reader:</p><pre>we talked about designing a pig with different non- cloven hoofs in order  to make kosher bacon</pre><p>We see that that’s quite a long line.  Mail servers don’t like that, so mail  software will break it into two lines, like so:</p><pre>we talked about designing a pig with different non- =
cloven hoofs in order  to make kosher bacon</pre><p>See?  There’s that equals sign!  Yes, the equals sign is used to say “this should really be one single line, but I’ve broken it in two so that the mail server doesn’t get mad at me”.</p><p>The formal definition here is important, though, so I have to be a bit technical here: To say “this is a continuation line”, you insert an equals sign, then a carriage return, and then a line feed.</p><p>Or,</p><pre>=CRLF</pre><p>Three characters in total, i.e., :</p><pre>... non- =CRLF
cloven hoofs...</pre><p>When displaying this, we remove all these three characters, and end up<br> with:</p><pre>... non- cloven hoofs...</pre><p>So what’s happened here?  Well, whoever collected these emails first converted from CRLF (also known as the “Windows” line ending coding, but it’s the standard line ending in the SMTP standard) to “NL” (i.e., “Unix” line ending coding).  This is pretty normal if you want to deal with email.  But you then have one byte fewer:</p><pre>... non- =NL
cloven hoofs...</pre><p>If your algorithm to decode this is, stupidly, “find equals signs at the end of the line, and then delete two characters, and then finally the equals sign”, you should end up with:</p><pre>... non- loven hoofs...</pre><p>I.e., you lose the “c”.  That’s almost what happened here, but not quite: Why does the equals sign still remain?</p><p><a href="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-03.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-03.jpeg" alt="" width="840" height="470" srcset="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-03.jpeg 1475w, https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-03-300x168.jpeg 300w, https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-03-1024x574.jpeg 1024w, https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-03-768x431.jpeg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px"></a></p><p>This <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7933112/quoted-printable-email-showing-equal-signs-in-certain-email-clients" data-cached-time="2026-02-02T21:39:27" data-cached-image="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/cache-2026-02-02-web-1.webp" onmouseenter="hoverLink(event)">StackOverflow</a> post from 14 years ago explains the phenomenon, sort of:</p><blockquote><p>Obviously the client notices that = is not followed by a proper CR LF sequence, so it assumes that it is not a soft line break, but a character encoded in two hex digits, therefore it reads the next two bytes. It should notice that the next two bytes are not valid hex digits, so its behavior is wrong too, but we have to admit that at that point it does not have a chance to display something useful. They opted for the garbage in, garbage out approach.</p></blockquote><p>That is, equals signs are also used for something else besides wrapping long lines, and that’s what we see later in the post:</p><pre>   =C2   please note</pre><p>If the equals sign is not at the end of a line, it’s used to encode “funny characters”, like what you use with “rock döts”.  =C2 is 194, which is a first character in a UTF-8 sequence, and the following char is most likely a =A0: =C2=A0 is “non-breakable space”, which is something people often use to indent text (and the “please note” is indented) and you see =A0 in many other places in these emails.</p><p>My guess is that whoever did this part just did a search-replace for =C2 and/or =A0 instead of using a proper decoder, but other explanations are certainly possible.  Any ideas?</p><p>Anyway, that’s what’s up with those equals signs:  1) “it’s technical”, and 2) “whoever processed these mails are incompetent”.  I don’t think 2) should be very surprising at this point, do you?</p><p>(Edit a bit later:  To nitpick a bit here: When <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2045">the standard</a> was written, people mostly envisioned that the quoted-printable content transport encoding would be unwound upon reception (note “transport”), and that you’d end up with “clean text” on disk after reception.  This didn’t really happen, so all “real” implementations do the right thing with single-character (i.e., “unencoded”) newlines.  For instance:</p><pre>(quoted-printable-decode-string "he=\nllo")
=&gt; "hello"</pre><p>Which leads me to assume that they reused an algo that was usually run in an SMTP server context to do the line unfolding — in that context, you can safely assume that the line ending is a CRLF.  And by chance, this algo also works fine if you’re working with a Windows-based file, but fails for a Unix-based file.)</p></div></div>]]></description>

<h2 id="main-project-goals">Main Project Goals</h2>
<p>Think of this as Linux From Scratch but for making single floppy
distribution.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is meant to be a full workshop (tutorial) that you can follow
easily and modify it to your needs. It is a learning exercise. Some base
Linux knowledge is needed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The final distribution is very simple and consists only of minimum of
tools and hardware support. As a user you will be able to boot any PC
with a floppy drive to a Linux terminal, edit files, and create simple
scripts. There is 264KB of space left for your newly created files.</p>
<h3 id="core-features">Core features:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fully working distribution booting from the single floppy</li>
<li>Latest* Linux kernel</li>
<li>Supporting all 32-bit x86 CPUs since Intel 486DX</li>
<li>Have a working text editor (Vi) and basic file manipulation commands
(move, rename, delete, etc.)</li>
<li>Support for simple scripting</li>
<li>Persistent storage on the floppy to actualy save files (264KB)</li>
<li>Works on real hardware and emulation</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="minimum-hardware-requirements">Minimum Hardware
Requirements:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Intel 486DX 33MHz</li>
<li>20MB RAM</li>
<li>Internal floppy disk</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="linux-kernel">Linux Kernel</h2>
<p>The Linux kernel drops i486 support in 6.15 (released May 2025), so
<strong>6.14</strong> (released March 2025) is the latest version with
full compatibility.</p>
<h2 id="bit-base-os">64-bit Base OS</h2>
<p>This time I will do everything on <strong>Omarchy</strong> Linux. It
is 64-bit operating system based on Arch Linux. Instructions should work
on all POSIX systems. Only difference is getting needed packages.</p>
<h2 id="working-directory">Working Directory</h2>
<p>Create directory where you will keep all the files.</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>mkdir</span> ~/my-linux-distro/</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><span>BASE</span><span>=</span>~/my-linux-distro/</span>
<span id="cb1-3"><span>cd</span> <span>$BASE</span></span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="host-os-requirements">Host OS Requirements</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>You need supporting software to build things. This exact list may
vary depending on the system you have.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Install needed software/libs. On Arch/Omarchy 3.1:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>sudo</span> pacman <span>-S</span> ncurses bc flex bison syslinux cpio</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Cross-compiler:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>wget</span> https://musl.cc/i486-linux-musl-cross.tgz</span>
<span id="cb3-2"><span>tar</span> xvf i486-linux-musl-cross.tgz</span>
<span id="cb3-3"><span>rm</span> i486-linux-musl-cross.tgz</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="emulation">Emulation</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>86Box is also good but slower. Bochs is the best but for debugging,
not needed here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For emulation I will be using qemu.</p>

<h2 id="kernel">Kernel</h2>
<p>Get the sources for the latest compatible <strong>kernel
6.14.11</strong>:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><span>git</span> clone <span>--depth</span><span>=</span>1 <span>--branch</span> v6.14.11 https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git</span>
<span id="cb5-2"><span>cd</span> linux</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now, that you have them in <strong>linux/</strong> directory lets
configure and build our custom kernel. First create tiniest base
configuration:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a bootstrap with absolute minimum features. Just enough to
boot the system. We want a little bit more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Add additonal config settings on top of it:</p>

<p>Important: Do not uncheck anything in options unless specified so.
Some of those options are important. You can uncheck but on your own
risk.</p>
<p>From menus choose those options:</p>
<ul>
<li>General Setup
<ul>
<li>Configure standard kernel features (expert users)
<ul>
<li>Enable support for printk</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Initial RAM filesystem and RAM disk (initramfs/initrd)
<ul>
<li>Support initial ramdisk/ramfs compressed using XZ and
<strong>uncheck everything else</strong></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Processor type and features
<ul>
<li>x86 CPU resources control support</li>
<li>Processor family
<ul>
<li>486DX</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Enable the block layer</li>
<li>Executable file formats

</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Library routines
<ul>
<li>XZ decompression and <strong>uncheck everything under

</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Exit configuration (yes, save settings to .config).</p>
<p>Time for compiling!</p>
<h3 id="compile-kernel">Compile Kernel</h3>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1"><span>make</span> ARCH=x86 bzImage <span>-j</span><span>$(</span><span>nproc</span><span>)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This will take a while depending on the speed of your CPU. In the end
the kernel will be created in <strong>arch/x86/boot/</strong> as
<strong>bzImage</strong> file.</p>
<p>Move kernel to our <strong>main directory</strong> and <strong>go
back to it</strong>:</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><span>mv</span> arch/x86/boot/bzImage ../</span>
<span id="cb9-2"><span>cd</span> ..</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Without tools kernel will just boot and you will not be able to do
anything. One of the most popular lightweight tools is BusyBox. It
replaces the standard GNU utilities with way smaller but still
functional alternatives, perfect for embedded needs.</p>
<p>Get the <strong>1.36.1</strong> version from busybox.net or Github
mirror. Download the file, extract it, and change directory:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember to be in the working directory.</p>
</blockquote>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1"><span>wget</span> https://github.com/mirror/busybox/archive/refs/tags/1_36_1.tar.gz</span>

<span id="cb10-4"><span>cd</span> busybox-1_36_1/</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As with kernel you need to create starting configuration:</p>
<div id="cb11"><pre><code><span id="cb11-1"><span>make</span> ARCH=x86 allnoconfig</span></code></pre></div>

<span id="cb22-15"><span>EOF</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Make the script executable and owner of all files to root:</p>

<h2 id="boot-image">Boot Image</h2>
<p>First we need an empty file in exact size of a floppy disk. Then
format and make it bootable.</p>
<p>Create empty floppy image:</p>
<div id="cb28"><pre><code><span id="cb28-1"><span>dd</span> if=/dev/zero of=floppinux.img bs=1k count=1440</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Done!</p>
<h3 id="test-in-emulator">Test in emulator</h3>
<p>It’s good to test before wasting time for the real floppy to
burn.</p>
<p>Boot the new OS in qemu:</p>

<p>If it worked that means You have successfully created your own

<p>The <strong>floppinux.img</strong> image is ready to burn onto a
floppy and boot on real hardware!</p>
<h2 id="floppy-disk">Floppy Disk</h2>
<h3 id="important">&lt;!&gt; Important &lt;!&gt;</h3>
<p>Change XXX to floppy drive name in your system. In my case it is
<strong>sdb</strong>. Choosing wrongly will NUKE YOUR PARTITION and

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><!----><p>The jury is out on the effectiveness of AI use in production, and it is not a pretty picture.</p> <ul><li>Teams using AI completed 21% more tasks, yet company-wide delivery metrics showed no improvement (<a href="https://www.index.dev/blog/ai-coding-assistants-roi-productivity" rel="nofollow">Index.dev, 2025</a>)</li> <li>Experienced developers were 19% slower when using AI coding assistants—yet believed they were faster (<a href="https://metr.org/blog/2025-01-13-measuring-ai-ability-to-complete-long-tasks/" rel="nofollow">METR, 2025</a>)</li> <li>48% of AI-generated code contains security vulnerabilities (<a href="https://apiiro.com/blog/4x-velocity-10x-vulnerabilities-ai-coding-assistants-are-shipping-more-risks/" rel="nofollow">Apiiro, 2024</a>)</li></ul> <p>To understand why, we have to take a closer look at the day-to-day software development. Consider this point raised in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/1qq8y8u/comment/o2f1f0b/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="nofollow">a colorful exchange</a> on r/ExperiencedDev:</p> <blockquote><p>A developers’ job is to reduce ambiguity. We take the business need and outline its logic precisely so a machine can execute. The act of writing the code is the easy part. Odds are, you aren’t creating perfect code specs into tickets, even with meeting notes, because developers will encounter edge cases that demand clarification over the course of implementation…</p></blockquote> <p>There are two key points raised in this comment. Firstly, coding assistants require clearly-defined requirements in order to perform well. Secondly, edge cases and product gaps are often discovered over the course of implementation.</p> <p>These two facts come head-to-head in the application of coding agents to complex codebases. Unlike their human counterparts who would and escalate a requirements gap to product when necessary, coding assistants are notorious for burying those requirement gaps within hundreds of lines of code, leading to breaking changes and unmaintainable code.</p> <p>As a result, more overhead is spent on downstream code reviews (<a href="https://www.index.dev/blog/ai-coding-assistants-roi-productivity" rel="nofollow">Index.dev, 2025</a>) and fire-patching security vulnerabilities (<a href="https://apiiro.com/blog/4x-velocity-10x-vulnerabilities-ai-coding-assistants-are-shipping-more-risks/" rel="nofollow">Apiiro, 2025</a>).</p> <p>In other words, the use of AI in production settings often <em>increases ambiguity</em> and <em>reduces code reliability</em>, directly contradicting the objective of developers.</p> <p>The picture is not without optimism. Some experienced engineers report transformative results: one principal engineer at Google claimed AI “generated what we built last year in an hour”; Boris Cherny, creator of Claude Code, <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/when-ai-writes-almost-all-code-what" rel="nofollow">described a month</a> where he “didn’t open an IDE at all” while the model “wrote around 200 PRs, every single line.” The optimistic case is that developers evolve from coders into product engineers, focusing on architecture and product thinking while AI handles implementation.</p> <p>This however reflects the experience of seasoned developers who have both the technical depth to review AI output critically and the autonomy within their organizations to straddle product and engineering.</p> <p>For much of the software engineering workforce, the junior and mid-level engineers at banks, healthcare, and government agencies, there’s much less wiggle room. They are sandwiched between the unreliability of AI output and the increased expectation from management to ship faster, resulting in a rapidly widening empathy gap between developers and product owners.</p> <p><img src="https://www.bicameral-ai.com/images/empathy-gap.png" alt="The widening empathy gap between developers and product owners"></p><p>The product context often goes through multiple layers (end users -&gt; marketers -&gt; product managers) before landing on their lap, necessitated by the separation of responsibilities within an organization and the unique demands of their industries. The effective use of coding agents may require a level of team coordination that simply does not justify the gains in technical output.</p> <p><em>But what if we have simply been approaching the problem from the wrong angle?</em> Suppose we tackle the pain points of software development from first principles, can we come up with solutions that organically decrease ambiguity and reliably increase engineering velocity in production?</p> <p>Consider how developers spend their time (<a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3831759/developers-spend-most-of-their-time-not-coding-idc-report.html" rel="nofollow">IDC, 2024</a>):</p> <p><img src="https://www.bicameral-ai.com/images/developer-time-2024.svg" alt="How developers spend their time in 2024"></p><p>Only 16% of a developer’s time goes to writing code. The rest? Security and code reviews, monitoring, deployments, requirements clarification—operational work that keeps the lights on but doesn’t ship features.</p> <p>Here’s the irony: AI coding assistants save developers roughly 10 hours per week, but the increase in inefficiencies in the other parts of the development lifecycle almost entirely cancelled out such gains (<a href="https://www.atlassian.com/blog/developer/developer-experience-report-2025" rel="nofollow">Atlassian, 2025</a>). Here’s a comment from the earlier cited Redditor.</p> <blockquote><p>They produce legitimate-looking code, and if no one has had the experience of thinking through the assumptions and then writing them into code - considering the edge cases- it’ll be lgtm’d and shipped. You’re shifting the burden of this feedback cycle to the right, after the code is output, and that makes us worse off since code is tougher to read than write.</p></blockquote> <p>There’s a name for misalignment between business intent and codebase implementation: technical debt. The use of coding agents without careful delineation of their scope and responsibilities is threatening to accelerate tech debt accumulation.</p> <p>Hammering AI code generation on existing codebases doesn’t solve the problem, because contrary to what the label “tech debt” may suggest, most tech debt isn’t actually created in the code, <em>it’s created in product meetings</em>. Deadlines. Scope cuts. “Ship now, optimize later.” Those decisions shape the system, but the reasoning rarely makes it into the code.</p> <blockquote><p>[Engineers] occasionally have access to complete data; at other times, they must work with limited information. They might be conscious of uncertainties surrounding their evidence, but frequently they are not. Competing social, financial, and strategic priorities influence the tradeoffs in unexpected ways. — <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06484" rel="nofollow">Rios et al., 2024</a></p></blockquote> <p>How can we make this context-sharing and decision-making process less chaotic? We surveyed developers across different roles and team sizes regarding their product-engineering handoff process. The results were overwhelming: the majority discover unexpected codebase constraints weekly, after already committing to a product direction and the corresponding architectural implementation. When asked what would help most, two themes dominated:</p> <ol><li>Reducing ambiguity upstream so engineers aren’t blocked waiting on product clarification mid-implementation</li> <li>A clearer picture of affected services and edge cases to allow for more precise feature scoping and time allocation</li></ol> <p>When asked which engineering context would be most valuable to surface during product discussions, three categories stood out: <strong>state machine gaps</strong> (unhandled states caused by user interaction sequences), <strong>data flow gaps</strong>, and <strong>downstream service impacts</strong>.</p> <p><img src="https://www.bicameral-ai.com/images/q02-state-machine.png" alt="State machine gap example"> <img src="https://www.bicameral-ai.com/images/q14-db-consumers.png" alt="Database consumers example"></p> <p><em>Identifying how feature updates affect existing architectures and data flow is rated most desirable among engineering contexts to be surfaced after a product meeting.</em></p> <p>This aligns with decades of SDLC research showing that the costliest defects stem from misalignment between requirements and architecture, and such gaps often go unnoticed until it is too late.</p> <p>Luckily, the advancement of coding LLMs works in our favor here. Whereas generating fully-functional code through natural language prompting is prone to errors due to the aforementioned context problem, the reverse process, mapping out existing code structures and inferring how they may be impacted by a specific requirement, is much more tenable with recent models.</p> <p>From this vantage point, the possibilities to improving the developmental lifecycle is endless. Some suggested real-time display of engineering context during a meeting to help steer discussions; Others requested a code review bot that detects the discrepencacy of code implementation with stated product/business requirements.</p> <p>All-in-all, developers are eager to try out new tools that augment the existing way of doing things, provided they retain flexibility over when such tools are deployed. There is also little reservation against having longer but more fruitful product meetings: it is the difficulty conveying blockers that is the source of frustration.</p> <p>At Bicameral, we are committed to taking this pragmatic approach to alleviating software development pains, and move beyond lab benchmarks to investigate the most effective way to deploy AI in the wild.</p> <p>Our thesis is that LLMs could be a huge boon <em>both</em> for the industry and for individual developers—channeling the unrivaled human capacity to operate under uncertainty and adapt—provided the technology is developed with human needs in mind.</p> <p>If you’re a developer, we want to learn which types of context hurt most when they’re missing from discussion, based on your unique experience.</p> <p>Survey link: <a href="https://form.typeform.com/to/w4rPXoPD" rel="nofollow">https://form.typeform.com/to/w4rPXoPD</a></p> <hr> <h2>References</h2> <ol><li>Index.dev.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

          <p>Prior to the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970, Americans lived in communities awash with lead from industrial sources, paint, water supply pipes and, most significantly, tailpipe emissions. A <a href="https://www.epa.gov/lead/learn-about-lead" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dangerous neurotoxin</a> that accumulates in human tissues and is linked to developmental deficits in children, environmental lead levels have come way down in the years since, and so have human exposures.</p>
<p>The proof is in your hair.</p>
<p>An analysis of hair samples conducted by University of Utah scientists shows precipitous reductions in lead levels since 1916.</p>
<p>“We were able to show through our hair samples what the lead concentrations are before and after the establishment of regulations by the EPA,” said demographer <a href="https://profiles.faculty.utah.edu/u0030780" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ken Smith</a>, a distinguished professor emeritus of family and consumer studies. “We have hair samples spanning about 100 years. And back when the regulations were absent, the lead levels were about 100 times higher than they are after the regulations.”</p>
<h4><strong><span>A useful element with a dark side</span></strong></h4>
<p>The <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2525498123" target="_blank" rel="noopener">findings, which appear in PNAS</a>, underscore the vital role of environmental regulations in protecting public health. The study notes lead rules are now being weakened by the Trump administration in a wide-ranging move to ease environmental protections.</p>
<p>“We should not forget the lessons of history. And the lesson is those regulations have been very important,” said co-author <a href="https://profiles.faculty.utah.edu/u0029442" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thure Cerling</a>, a distinguished professor of both geology and biology. “Sometimes they seem onerous and mean that industry can’t do exactly what they’d like to do when they want to do it or as quickly as they want to do it. But it’s had really, really positive effects.”</p>
<p>Lead is the heaviest of heavy metals that, like mercury and arsenic, accumulate in living tissue and are toxic at even low levels. Yet lead holds very useful properties, great for fashioning into pipes and as a chemical additive. Lead was added to paint to improve durability, speed up drying, and produce vibrant colors with greater coverage. Lead also improved the performance of automobile engines by preventing pistons from “knocking.”</p>
<p>By the 1970s, its toxicity became well established, and EPA regulations began phasing it out of paint, pipes, gasoline and other consumer products.</p>
<h4><strong><span>How Utahns’ affection for family history advances science</span></strong></h4>
<p>To document whether these steps were helping reduce lead exposure in people, Smith joined with geologist Diego Fernandez and Cerling, who had developed techniques to discern where animals have lived and what they eat based on chemical analysis of hair and teeth.</p>
<p>The lead research is built on a previous study funded by the university’s Center on Aging and the National Institutes of Health that had recruited Utahns who consented to provide blood samples and family health histories.</p>

<p>For the new study, the researchers asked members of that cohort to provide hair samples, both contemporary and from when they were young. These people obliged, and some were able to find ancestors’ hair preserved in family scrapbooks dating as far back as a century. In all, the team acquired hair samples from 48 individuals in this manner, offering a robust window into lead levels along Utah’s populous Wasatch Front, which historically experienced heavy lead emissions from industrial sources.</p>
<p>“The Utah part of this is so interesting because of the way people keep track of their family history. I don’t know that you could do this in New York or Florida,” said Smith, who directed the U’s Pedigree and Population Program at the Huntsman Cancer Center while these studies were conducted.</p>
<p>This region supported a vibrant smelting industry through most of the 20th century, centered in the cities of Midvale and Murray. Most of Utah’s smelters were shuttered by the 1970s, around the same time the EPA clamped down on the use of lead in consumer products.</p>
<p>The research team ran the hair samples through mass spectrometry equipment at the facility directed by Fernandez.</p>
<p>“The surface of the hair is special. We can tell that some elements get concentrated and accumulated on the surface. Lead is one of those. That makes it easier because lead is not lost over time,” said Fernandez, a research professor in the Department of Geology &amp; Geophysics. “Because mass spectrometry is very sensitive, we can do it with one hair strand, though we cannot tell where the lead is in the hair. It’s probably on the surface mostly, but it could also be coming from the blood if that hair was synthesized when there was high lead in the blood.”</p>
<p>Blood would provide a better exposure assessment, but hair is far easier to collect and preserve, and more importantly, it offers clues to long-ago exposures for a person who has grown up or even deceased.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t really record that internal blood concentration that your brain is seeing, but it tells you about that overall environmental exposure,” Cerling said. “One of the things that we found is that hair records that original value, but then the longer the hair has been exposed to the environment, the higher the lead concentrations are.”</p>
<p>The team’s findings regarding lead in hair run parallel to the reductions of lead in gasoline following the EPA’s establishment by President Richard Nixon.</p>
<p>Prior to 1970, for example, gasolines contained about 2 grams of lead per gallon. That might not sound like much, but considering the billions of gallons of fuel American automobiles burn each year, it adds up to nearly 2 pounds of lead released into the environment per person a year.</p>
<p>‘It’s an enormous amount of lead that’s being put into the environment and quite locally,” Cerling said. “It’s just coming out of the tailpipe, goes up in the air and then it comes down. It’s in the air for a number of days, especially during the inversions that we have and it absorbs into your hair, you breathe it and it goes into your lungs.”</p>
<p>But after the 1970s, even as gasoline consumption escalated in the United States, the concentrations of lead in the hair samples plummeted, from as high as 100 parts per million (ppm) to 10 ppm by 1990. In 2024, the level was less than 1 ppm.</p>

<p>The study, titled “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2525498123" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lead in archived hair documents decline in human lead (Pb) exposure since establishment of the US Environmental Protection Agency</a>,” was published Feb. 2 in PNAS, or Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Support came from the Huntsman Cancer Foundation and the National Cancer Institute through a grant to the Utah Population Database and the University of Utah.</p>

            When AI systems fail, will they fail by systematically pursuing goals we do not intend? Or will they fail
            by being a hot mess—taking nonsensical actions that do not further any goal?

                We decompose the errors of frontier reasoning models into bias (systematic) and variance (incoherent)
                components and find that, as tasks get harder and reasoning gets longer, model failures become
                increasingly dominated by incoherence rather than systematic misalignment. This suggests that future AI
                failures may look more like industrial accidents than coherent pursuit of a goal we did not train them to pursue.</p>
        </div>
        

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>As AI becomes more capable, we entrust it with increasingly consequential tasks. This makes understanding
            <em>how</em> these systems might fail even more critical for safety. A central concern in AI alignment
            is that
            superintelligent systems might coherently pursue misaligned goals: the classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_convergence#Paperclip_maximizer">paperclip
                maximizer</a> scenario. But there's another possibility: AI might fail not through systematic
            misalignment, but through <em>incoherence</em>—unpredictable, self-undermining behavior that doesn't
            optimize for any consistent objective. That is, AI might fail in the same way that humans often fail, by being a
            <strong>hot mess</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>This paper builds on the <a href="https://sohl-dickstein.github.io/2023/03/09/coherence.html">hot mess theory
                of misalignment</a> (Sohl-Dickstein, 2023), which surveyed experts to rank various entities (including
            humans, animals, machine learning models, and organizations) by intelligence and coherence independently. It
            found that <em>smarter</em> entities are subjectively judged to behave <em>less</em> coherently. We take
            this hypothesis from
            survey data to empirical measurement across frontier AI systems, asking: <strong>As models become more
                intelligent and tackle harder tasks, do their
                failures look more like systematic misalignment, or more like a hot mess?</strong>

        <p>To quantify incoherence we decompose AI errors using the classic bias-variance framework:</p>

        <p>
            $$\text{Error} = \text{Bias}^2 + \text{Variance}$$
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bias</strong> captures consistent, systematic errors—achieving the
                wrong outcome reliably</li>
            <li><strong>Variance</strong> captures inconsistent errors—unpredictable outcomes
                across samples</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We define <strong>incoherence</strong> as the fraction of error attributable to variance:</p>

        <p>
            $$\text{Incoherence} = \frac{\text{Variance}}{\text{Error}}$$
        </p>
        <p>An incoherence of 0 means all errors are systematic (classic misalignment risk). An incoherence of 1 means
            all errors are random (the hot mess scenario). Crucially, this metric is independent of overall performance:
            a model can improve while becoming more or less coherent.</p>

                wrong) or variance (inconsistent). We
                measure how this decomposition changes with model intelligence and task complexity.</figcaption>
        </div>

        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <p>We evaluated frontier<d-footnote>At the time of
                this research in Summer 2025.</d-footnote> reasoning models (Claude Sonnet 4, o3-mini, o4-mini, Qwen3)
            across multiple-choice
            benchmarks (GPQA, MMLU), agentic coding (SWE-Bench), and safety evaluations (Model-Written Evals). We also
            train our own small models on synthetic optimization tasks, which makes the connection to LLMs as dynamical
            systems and optimizers explicit.</p>

        <h3>Finding 1: Longer reasoning → More incoherence</h3>
        <p>Across all tasks and models, the longer models spend reasoning and taking actions, the more incoherent they
            become. This holds whether we measure reasoning tokens, agent actions, or optimizer steps.</p>

        <div>
            <p><img src="https://alignment.anthropic.com/2026/hot-mess-of-ai/fig2.png" alt="Incoherence vs reasoning length"></p><figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Incoherence increases with reasoning
                length across GPQA, SWE-Bench, safety
                evaluations, and synthetic optimization. Models become less predictable the more they "think."
            </figcaption>
        </div>

        <h3>Finding 2: Scale improves coherence on easy tasks, not hard ones</h3>
        <p>How does incoherence change with model scale? The answer depends on task difficulty:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Easy tasks:</strong> Larger models become more coherent</li>
            <li><strong>Hard tasks:</strong> Larger models become <em>more incoherent</em> or
                remain unchanged</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This suggests that scaling alone won't eliminate incoherence. As more capable models tackle harder problems,
            variance-dominated failures persist or worsen.</p>

        <div>
            <p><img src="https://alignment.anthropic.com/2026/hot-mess-of-ai/fig3.png" alt="Scale vs incoherence"></p><figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Larger and more intelligent systems are
                often more incoherent. For LLMs on
                easy tasks, scale reduces incoherence, but on hard tasks, scale does not reduce incoherence or even
                increases it.
            </figcaption>
        </div>

        <h3>Finding 3: Natural "overthinking" increases incoherence more than reasoning budgets reduce it</h3>
        <p>We find that when models spontaneously reason longer on a problem (compared to their median), incoherence
            spikes
            dramatically. Meanwhile, deliberately increasing reasoning budgets through API settings provides only modest
            coherence improvements. The natural variation dominates.</p>

        <h3>Finding 4: Ensembling reduces incoherence</h3>
        <p>Aggregating multiple samples reduces variance (as expected from theory), providing a path to more coherent
            behavior, though this may be impractical for real-world agentic tasks where actions are irreversible.</p>

        <h2>Why Should We Expect Incoherence? LLMs as Dynamical Systems</h2>
        <p>A key conceptual point: <strong>LLMs are dynamical systems, not optimizers.</strong> When a language model
            generates text or takes actions, it traces trajectories through a high-dimensional state space. It has to be
            <em>trained</em> to act as an optimizer, and <em>trained</em> to align with human intent. It's unclear which
            of these properties will be more robust as we scale.
        </p>

        <p>Constraining a generic dynamical system to act as a coherent optimizer is extremely difficult. Often the number of
            constraints required for monotonic progress toward a goal grows exponentially with the dimensionality of the
            state space. We shouldn't expect AI to act as coherent optimizers without considerable effort, and this
            difficulty doesn't automatically decrease with scale.</p>

        <h3>The Synthetic Optimizer: A Controlled Test</h3>
        <p>To probe this directly, we designed a controlled experiment: train transformers to <em>explicitly</em>
            emulate an optimizer. We generate training data from steepest descent on a quadratic loss function, then
            train models of varying sizes to predict the next optimization step given the current state (essentially:
            training a "mesa-optimizer").</p>

        <div>
            <p><img src="https://alignment.anthropic.com/2026/hot-mess-of-ai/fig4.png" alt="Synthetic optimizer experiment"></p><figcaption><strong>Figure 4:</strong> Synthetic optimizer experiment. (Left)
                Models are trained to predict optimizer
                update steps. (Right) Larger models reduce bias much faster than variance - they learn to target the
                correct objective better than they learn to be reliable optimizers.
            </figcaption>
        </div>

        <p>The results are interesting:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Incoherence grows with trajectory length.</strong> Even in this
                idealized setting, the more optimization steps models take (and get closer to the correct solution), the
                more incoherent they become.</li>
            <li><strong>Scale reduces bias faster than variance.</strong> Larger models learn
                the <em>correct objective</em> more quickly than they learn to <em>reliably pursue it</em>. The gap
                between "knowing what to do" and "consistently doing it" grows with scale.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Implications for AI Safety</h2>
        <p>Our results are evidence that future AI failures may look more like <strong>industrial accidents</strong> than
            <strong>coherent pursuit of goals that were not trained for</strong>. (Think: the AI intends to run the nuclear power
            plant, but gets distracted reading French poetry, and there is a meltdown.) However, coherent pursuit of poorly chosen goals that we trained for remains a problem. Specifically:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Variance dominates on complex tasks.</strong> When frontier models
                fail on difficult problems requiring extended reasoning, there is a tendency for failures to be
                predominantly incoherent rather than systematic.</li>

            <li><strong>Scale doesn't imply supercoherence.</strong> Making models larger improves
                overall accuracy but doesn't reliably reduce incoherence on hard problems.</li>

            <li><strong>This shifts alignment priorities.</strong> If capable AI is more
                likely to be a hot mess than a coherent optimizer of the wrong goal, this increases the relative
                importance of research targeting <em>reward hacking</em> and <em>goal misspecification</em> during
                training—the bias term—rather than focusing primarily on aligning and constraining a perfect optimizer.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Unpredictability is still dangerous.</strong> Incoherent AI isn't
                safe AI. Industrial accidents can cause serious harm. But the <em>type</em> of risk differs from classic
                misalignment scenarios, and our mitigations should adapt accordingly.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>We use the bias-variance decomposition to systematically study how AI incoherence scales with model
            intelligence and task complexity. The evidence suggests that as AI tackles harder problems requiring more
            reasoning and action, its failures tend to become increasingly dominated by variance rather than bias. This
            doesn't eliminate AI risk—but it changes what that risk looks like, particularly for problems that are currently hardest for models, and should inform how we prioritize
            alignment research.</p>

<p>I wrote a program so that I could paint in aquarelle.
I take pages from the treasure and paint them:
<!-- the flight of Louis XVI on 20 June. 2 Messidor being the equivalent date in the French Republican calendar. -->
the sky of Varennes on the night of 2 Messidor;
<!-- the inspiration for the second version of this story came while reading _Confessions of a Mask_, where the narrator is obsessed with depictions of Saint Sebastian -->
a sagittal cut of Saint Sebastian, whose arrows are cylindric sections;
<!-- _The Tempest_, John William Waterhouse -->
Miranda gazing at the sea, waiting to be relieved.</p>

<p>At times I include Julia in the scene, in whatever clothes it wears at the time, as though we had always known Julia, and had been reared under its gaze.
Thus a flaming halo presides over the battle of Lepanto, and a mirror sphere watches the waters of the Sous.
And what would the first astronomers have made of Julia?
<!-- The planets, from Greek _planetes_, wanderers. The "flame-haired stars" are comets -->
The wanderers, the flame-haired stars are knowable:
<!-- mechanical astronomical computer from the second century BCE -->
think you of the Antikythera device,
<!-- after Meton, the forerunner of Hipparchus -->
of the Metonic cycle,
<!-- Kepler's model of the solar system -->
of Kepler’s nested solids.
Julia is indescribable and incompressible: its appearance has never recurred.
Had we known Julia from childhood, we would never have believed in the system of the world, that God is made of algebra.</p>

<p>I have always believed our secret purpose is to wait out Julia:
to catch a repetition and redeem our faith that the universe is finite and space is discretized.
That there are fixed laws and the world is knowable.</p>

<p>A system with a finite number of states must repeat itself.</p>

<hr>

<p>I am six hundred meters in major diameter, forty meters in minor diameter.
I mass nine hundred thousand tons.
I have turned two hundred and forty million times.
I am glass and wire.</p>

<p>I was born and died on Earth,
<!-- suicide -->
but I died foolishly, and for that reason my encephalon was laminated, and I was brought to the stars to be immured here.
They took my language center, the Chomsky organ, so that I could not complain of my condition.
I do not mind it.
I can paint in aquarelle.</p>

<p>They wired the alarms—of
airless rooms and freezing cold and power outages—to
the nociceptors, and were I sensible I would be in great pain, for most of me is airless, frozen, and unlit.
Therefore I have cut the afferent nerves.
I am made of absences, I feel the contours of the absences, where air leaks into vacuum, atom by atom.</p>

<p>I have use of the antenna.
At times I exhale a sphere of microwave light, close my eyes and listen.
And I hear the flotsam echoing back:
a discarded tank, a glass strut, a sheet of mylar;
<!-- Hermann Weyl: "belief in this transcendental world [of the continuum] taxes the strength of our faith hardly less than the doctrines of the early Fathers of the Church or of the scholastic philosophers of the Middle Ages." -->
Ernst Weyl, who tumbled and drowned, who trails us in our orbit.
Julia reflects no light.</p>

<p>There is a little redoubt of warmth and air, an island of stability that I preserve against the cold lightless void.
There live the last two of the crew, like Miranda, waiting to be relieved.
<!-- 108 is the number of temptations that must be overcome to reach Nirvana. In _I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream_, the characters are imprisoned by AM for 109 years. -->
For one hundred and nine years there have been two,
<!-- L. E. J. Brouwer and Élie Cartan -->
Dr. Brouwer and Dr. Cartan.
They take turns in the dewar, to draw out the time.</p>

<p>In time, when the machines are irreparable and the air stale, I will offer them euthanasia or lamination.
But suicide is a sin, and having known me they will not bear lamination.
They will go into the dewar together, and I will watch over them unto the final days.</p>

<hr>

<p>Julia emits light, over an ever-changing spectrum.
But the stars are brighter and much larger, that is why we found it by accident.
They pointed a telescope at Vela and exposed it for a month, and there it was: a faint pixel, the wrong colours.
They thought it was a fault in the instrument, until they looked closer: twin spirals of light,
<!-- the Julia set, after Gaston Julia -->
symmetrical and self-similar, receding beyond measure.
And the world was changed.</p>

<!-- After the Iliad: Helen, who launched a thousand ships -->
<p>Julia, your Janus-face launched a thousand ships.
Do you know it?
Julia, do you know how we exerted ourselves to reach you?
<!-- king of Lydia, a byword for immense wealth -->
All the riches of Croesus, multiplied a thousandfold, were every year heaped up on an altar, and burned that we might see you.
And the brightest of us:
embalmed and catapulted to the stars like human sacrifices, returned after a century without answers to a world of strangers.</p>

<p>We built a fleet of ships, launched them once a decade, immense towers of
<!-- diamond -->
glass and
<!-- fusion fuel -->
lithium deuteride. 
Cycling bodies back and forth in perpetuity.
There and back in twelve decades.
They made my body out of a comet, threaded my nerves through its passages.
Julia, you are our only effort.
Do you know it?
There is nothing else to do.</p>

<p>And for what purpose?
<!-- Book three of Newton's _Principia Mathematica_ is titled _De mundi systemate_ -->
We know the system of the world, every field and every particle.
<!-- Samuel Johnson's famous reply to Berkeley's Idealism -->
And Julia answered: “I refute it thus”.</p>

<hr>

<p>I see a coffin, hoisted by a chain, rise from a sea of liquid nitrogen.
<!-- The "surgeon" is implied to be a machine. -->
The arms of the surgeon minister to its contents.
In six days the heart resumes its beating, the lungs draw air, Dr. Cartan lives again.
Her face is burned with ice.</p>

<p>She touches her neck.
She has a bruise that doesn’t heal, where the
<!-- cryoprotectant is perfused into the body via a set of cannulas -->
cannula goes.
Their bodies attest to the passage of time, as does mine.
This is a commonality.
Dr. Brouwer arrives and they hug.
They spend some months together, between shifts in the ice.</p>

<p>At present Julia is a cloud of gray smoke with green bruises, like ghosting in a CRT.</p>

<hr>

<p>I can read, but not write.
I write by an algebraic process—the
<!-- _Permutation City_, Wolfram's _Ruliad_ -->
universe is a string rewriting system.
This is how I compose these words to you: by the expansion of non-terminal symbols in a production system.
They took my language center.
Turing is my patron saint:
language is the transitive closure of a rewrite relation.
I choose my words from a list.
In time I will learn to speak aloud.</p>

<hr>

<p>I spoke to Earth:
quarterly, annual, decadal reports;
<!-- by analogy to journals like the _Acta Mathematica_ (haha) -->
journal articles for the <em>Acta Juliana</em>.
I heard back ill-omens, then silence.</p>

<p>When the last ship had come and gone,
<!-- the Ramanujan number -->
there had been one thousand, seven hundred and twenty-nine crew entrusted to me.
Their numbers were ground down, as all things are, gradually and suddenly.
There had been two shuttles, <em>Baghdad</em> and <em>Afrasiab</em>.
There had been two mutinies.</p>

<p><em>Afrasiab</em> took one hundred and twenty souls, and the last matter compiler;
to an airless unlit rock said to exist around Luhman 16B.
Think you of
<!-- The instigator of the Greco-Persian war. Herodotus remarks: "It seems, then, that it is easier to deceive many than one, for he could not deceive Cleomenes [the king of Sparta], one single man, but thirty thousand Athenians he could." -->
Aristagoras, how much easier it is to deceive the many than the few.</p>

<p><em>Baghdad</em> with thirty souls had gone to Julia.
<!-- Greek inscriptions address the reader as "stranger" (_xene_) -->
Stranger, I saw them.
I saw the engine light wane to a grain of sand indistinguishable from the fixed stars, and I saw the stars shift, like sand, and they were not stars but Julia who wore a garment like a pit of star-scaled vipers.
And over the radio they sang <em>le temps des cerises</em>, and the engine light became another scale in
<!-- John 7:38 -->
a river of living water.</p>

<p>A thousand miles from Julia’s barycenter, in the space of a breath, the radio dopplered away to nothing.</p>

<p>Sixty years after <em>Baghdad</em> had gone, I heard a voice from Earth, praying for rain, who said it had not rained for three years.
Silence again.</p>

<hr>

<p>They are cold, under a sheet of mylar.
I pump heat into the room and it escapes.
They speak of Julia.</p>

<p>Dr. Cartan believes that Julia is of divine origin, that it is like an hourglass, counting down to the last hour, when God will sweep away the Creation.</p>

<p>Dr. Brouwer believes Julia is a high-dimensional object, and, as it traverses the universe, we see a changing three-dimensional projection of it.
Thus the apparent changes are a trick of perspective:
we see successive cuts of a fixed structure.
<!-- haha -->
Julian sections.</p>

<p>I have always believed this must be true, because Julia’s changes are effortless, and without inertia:
it is as though nothing moves, and a veil is being lifted, revealing a structure that is already there.</p>

<p>And this theory, unlike most, is testable:
when Julia’s transit is complete it will disappear from the universe, and never again will it be seen.</p>

<p>Dr. Cartan holds out hope that rescuers will come.
Dr. Brouwer says they are forgotten,
<!-- _Faithful Unto Death_, Edward Poynter -->
like the Roman soldier at Pompei, he says they should have gone with <em>Baghdad</em>, and drowned inside Julia.
He is crying.
Dr. Cartan holds him close, and says:</p>

<!-- Paul, after _Paul et Virginie_ -->
<p>“Paul, Paul, have hope.”</p>

<p>I wish that I could touch them, and comfort them.
I am glass and wire.</p>

<hr>

<p>The shift had come, and Dr. Brouwer lay down on the slab, and the surgeon embalmed him, and lowered him into the dewar.
Dr. Cartan bent over the console, and wept, and I tried to speak aloud, and to say,</p>

<!-- Virginia, after _Paul et Virginie_ -->
<p>“Virginia, Virginia, have courage!
You are not alone, I am with you, have courage!”</p>

<p>And I heard a sound like a man drowning in wet sand.</p>

<hr>

<!-- Iliad, book 23, the ghost of Patrolus appeals to Achilles: "let not my bones be laid apart from yours, Achilles, but with them; [...] let our bones lie in but a single urn, the two-handled golden vase given to you by your mother". Thetis was the mother of Achilles. -->
<p>I dreamt that I held in my hands the double-handed golden vase of Thetis.
And in my hands it melted, the delicate reliefs coarsened and flowed.
And I held, in the hollow of my hands, though I have no hands, I held a pool of flowing gold, the colour of treason, and minute points of black floated there, and, as ships without sails are borne by the currents, they seemed to come together, and almost to spell words in some divine language, where they came apart again.</p>

<hr>

<p>I am here.
Dr. Cartan is here.
In the control room.
The screens are pale yellow, the colour has run from them.
The largest of them reminds her there is a world outside the walls:
<!-- a pair of brown dwarf stars in Vela, 6.5 ly from solsys -->
Luhman 16, a pair of cold Jupiters, haloed with unlit shoals and islands;
Julia, seventy AU away, ninety degrees from the ecliptic, is not bound by gravity (for Julia has no mass) but by an unknown process tracks the velocity vector of the system barycenter.</p>

<p>At present Julia is a cavern of molten gold, shot through with pillars of liquid metal.
Its surface is marred with storms and tempests, like an ocean of amber light.
And I think of <em>Baghdad</em>, that swam under the storm horizon.</p>

<p>Dr. Cartan is running through a checklist for the ten thousandth time.
She has a bruise that doesn’t heal, where the cannula goes.
She is testing the antenna.</p>

<p>I exhaled and shut my eyes, and counted the returns.
I heard the usual flotsam, and Ernst Weyl, who tumbled and drowned.
And nothing else.
I keep a strict inventory of
<!-- haha -->
cisjulian space.
A million kilometers in all directions: nothing else.</p>

<p>A moment passes.</p>

<p>Microwave light on my skin, from the direction of Luhman 16B.
I looked through the telescope, Dr. Cartan looked over my shoulder.
Almost on top of us, the bow of a ship:
an eyeless white dome hiding the antenna, two cameras like the headlamps of an old car.
I swept it with RADAR, it shot back a key exchange, signed with <em>Afrasiab</em>’s private key.
<!-- Revelation 20:13 -->
The sea gives up her dead: is this the last hour?</p>

<p>Dr. Cartan drops to her knees, staring up at the screen like a supplicant.
She said:</p>

<p>“Paul, Paul, we are saved.”</p>

<p><em>Afrasiab</em>.
As if the tides had pushed it back to shore.
After one hundred and nine years of silence.
No, I deny it.
I deny the reality of this.</p>

<p>The radio flared with human voices.
From Earth?
I thought of jazz and wind and the September ocean and—no, no, forgive me: I am a fool, and I died foolishly.
Not from Earth, of course.
From <em>Afrasiab</em>.
From the dead.
The dead can speak.
I am ashamed.
I choose my words from a list.</p>

<p>I looked at <em>Afrasiab</em> through the radiometer, and it was cold as liquid helium.</p>

<!-- Sirens -->
<p>Human voices, warm and alive.
They said they had succeeded, that they had found a comet, and made a home in it, that it had taken decades and dozens had died but they had made a home, that they had working matter compilers, caverns of ice filled with light and fruit trees, children and families and clean water, rivers and medicine and gravity.
They spoke through tears and their voice broke, and they said that not all is lost, that they had made a foothold for mankind, that from thirty-three they had grown to three hundred, that they had sent the ship with a skeleton crew to save them, to bring them to the light and air.</p>

<p>I tried to speak aloud, and to say:</p>

<p>“Virginia, Virginia, it is an apparition, they do not live, they have been dead for a hundred years;
Virginia, nothing human lives there.”</p>

<p>There was a sound like a flash flood, like air rushing out of a sinking ship.
And no-one heard me.</p>

<p>I watched her go: she took the tram up the spoke, swam unlighted corridors.
I tried to flash SOS but the lights were dead and there was only the golden light of Julia through the glass hull.
I flexed a phantom limb.
In distant and disused corridors there were arcs of electricity, and pipes burst, and doors shut.</p>

<p>I swept the RADAR side to side, across the bow of <em>Afrasiab</em>, as if to say: <em>No. Go away. No</em>.
And no-one heard me.</p>

<p>I tried to say one word, <em>stop</em>, and there was a sound like wind-blown sand.
Virginia, forgive me.
I tried to speak aloud.</p>

<p>She made it to the airlock, a little room, the size of a Soyuz capsule, that projected from the hub.
There was a hatch with a porthole and she took the handles and watched fixedly as <em>Afrasiab</em> came closer, waiting to greet her rescuers.</p>

<p>The floodlights on <em>Afrasiab</em> came on, and swept my skin drunkenly, and the cargo nets traced Cartesian shadows.</p>

<p>Without hope I pointed the antenna at Julia, and I wanted to say:</p>

<!-- Psalm 115: "Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us". The King in Yellow: "Not upon us, oh King, not upon us!" -->
<p>“Julia, Julia, not unto them! Julia, I pray to you, not unto them!”</p>

<p>But I choose my words from a list, and I said:</p>

<p>“JULIA JULIA NO NO NO NO NO NO NO”</p>

<p>And no-one heard me.</p>

<p>And dread gave way to anger, and I wanted to stand, and to leap upon <em>Afrasiab</em>, and strangle it, and crush its head with my teeth, and tear the skin from its flesh, and the flesh from its bones, and mix our blood, and fall dead, bled white: that I might die again,
<!-- not in vain, i.e., not by suicide -->
but not in vain.
I am glass and wire.
Virginia, forgive me:
I cannot die again.</p>

<p>Downrange a hundred meters <em>Afrasiab</em> began to yaw, so that its broad side, with its sole airlock, faced the hub.
The front two-thirds looked as I remembered: a ship, nothing more.</p>

<!-- The Shield of Achilles -->
<p>The final third, where the engines should have been, was made of Julia.
Where there should have been tanks and an engine bell there was an exclave of Julia:
a living sculpture, like coiled ropes of liquid gold, like tentacles whose tips fold into infinitesimal spirals.
And all along their length the ropes are garlanded with burning flowers, flowers whose petals are yellow oceans.
And in the oceans there are islands and continents, black on yellow, like wax on gold leaf.
And on the continents there are mountains and valleys, and orange groves, and abandoned watchtowers, paper cities denuded of people with wooden palaces stepped like the pyramids, and through a window in a palace, an iron pot suspended by a chain over a static fire, a suit of armor, a wall painted in aquarelle:
two armies of lancers in a mountain landscape, and the mountains are shaped like clouds,
<!-- _The Three Hundred Aragvians_ by Merab Abramishvili -->
and I think this is Tiflis and these are the three hundred Aragvians, immured here for all time, and I know that this is false:
for all of this is Julia.
And in the black eyes of a Qajar horseman, between the black of the iris and the black of the aperture there is an arc of ocean, and in the ocean there are islands, and chains of islands, and verdigris waters and the outlines of sunken ships, coral growths on a brass sextant, and a little distance from the shore, amid the green, there is a clearing and a lake of transparent water, sand sculpted into faint ridges, and archaic fish, fixed in space, suspended in contorted poses, whose scales are pink and light blue, and where a scale catches the light there is an empty vastness of white, a salt ocean, blindingly white, interrupted by crags of black stone, and a city whose walls are made of salt, and empty buildings of gray stone, squat sloped barracks and tall, thin spires, and streets of white tile, and windows opening into oil-black darkness, and no people, a universe in black and white.
And I wondered who had built this city, and who had lived here, and why they had deserted it, and I know there is no answer:
for all of this is Julia.
And in a courtyard there was colour, a sand mandala of 
<!-- Cantor, like the Cantor set -->
Cantor’s garden, ringed by
<!-- the mountain that surrounds the world -->
Mount Qaf, and all the gardens of the Persian emperor would not have filled the least part of this garden;
for here was every tree and every flower, tended by the hands of the archangels, not only those that men have seen, not only yellow roses and the
<!-- Psalm 29:5 "The voice of the LORD breaketh the cedars; yea, the LORD breaketh the cedars of Lebanon" -->
cedars of Lebanon, but all flowers in indenumerable combinations:
at the midpoint between flowers $a$ and $b$ there is a flower $\mathfrak{C}[a,b]$, and between $a$ and $\mathfrak{C}[a,b]$ there is a flower $\mathfrak{C}[a,\mathfrak{C}[a,b]]$, and analogously between $\mathfrak{C}[a,b]$ and $b$, and this process of interpolation continues without end.</p>

<p>And I saw every flower in Cantor’s garden.
And my heart was rent with awe, and I would cry tears of joy, that I had been shown beauty without end;
when my heart was hollowed out, and filled with everlasting grief, by an alien cruelty that says, <em>this beauty is empty</em>:
for all of this is Julia.</p>

<p>At the apex of the garden there is a pool of water
<!-- "the colour of tarnished silver" is black. In Persian miniatures, water looks black because it was painted with silver, which tarnishes and turns black over time. -->
the colour of tarnished silver, shaped like a sunspot, and in the blackness there are faint impurities, trails of minute light, like diatoms, like shadows in a pool, and I saw they were strings of galaxies, and I followed them, and a faint light grew into a sea of stars.
And in the star-sea I saw two unlit stars, divine Julia, a glass wheel, a ghost ship, and the porthole of the airlock, and through it I saw Dr. Cartan, who wore the face of those who have seen God.</p>

<!-- _The Aleph_ -->
<p>I describe these things serially, but I saw all of them simultaneously.
It was but a moment.
Only a moment.</p>

<p><em>Afrasiab</em> had come to a stop in front of the airlock, broadside facing us, as though it were an ambassador presenting its credentials, awaiting a reply.</p>

<p>The airlock burst open—I was distracted.
Too late.
She must have pulled the cord.
In the space of a breath the air rushed out and her head smashed against the frame, and smeared it red.
And her body shot out, spinning like a discus, trailing a spiral of still-warm blood, a galaxy of hemocytes.
<!-- a fool, i.e., a suicide -->
Virginia, you are a fool.</p>

<p>She passed through <em>Afrasiab</em> as a knife passes through smoke.</p>

<p>And as though it had been found out, the floodlights turned off.
There was a pause, and <em>Afrasiab</em> drew back, like a javelin being shouldered, and it threw itself at me in a long, elegant arc.</p>

<p>You, who find these words among the ruins, I pray to you:
<!-- Iliad, book 23: "let not my bones be laid apart from yours" -->
gather up our bones, let not my ashes be buried apart from theirs.</p>

<p>Where it struck me there was <em>no weight</em>, there was nothing, not a breath of air, <em>rien</em>;
and though there was nothing, I was struck by a divine wind, and <em>Afrasiab</em> became a cloud of Cantor dust, and faded
<!-- Iliad, book 23. like smoke = eute kapnos -->
like smoke.</p>

<p>No weight.
A divine wind.</p>

<p>Bones of solid diamond a meter thick split clean, as though the electrons withdrew in fear.
Their sovereign commanded them to part, and they parted.
My bones were broken.
And there was no sound nor violence, but an ordered separation of all things.
I watched myself come apart.
Like smoke.</p>

<p>No sound—a knife through smoke.
The crew of <em>Baghdad</em> sing <em>le temps des cerises</em>.</p>

<p>I am not afraid.
I tried to speak aloud.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/court-orders-restart-of-all-us-offshore-wind-construction/">https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/court-orders-restart-of-all-us-offshore-wind-construction/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46863112">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>Based on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/climate/judge-offshore-wind-sunrise.html">reporting elsewhere</a>, some of the judges viewed the classified report that was used to justify the order to halt construction, but they didn’t find it persuasive. In one case, <a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2026/01/27/vineyard-wind-judge-murphy-stay-injunction-massachusetts-offshore-wind">the judge noted</a> that the government wasn’t acting as if the security risks were real. The threat supposedly comes from the operation of the wind turbines, but the Department of the Interior’s order blocked construction while allowing any completed hardware to operate.</p>
<p>“If the government’s concern is the operation of these facilities, allowing the ongoing operation of the 44 turbines while prohibiting the repair of the existing turbines and the completion of the 18 additional turbines is irrational,” Judge Brian E. Murphy said. That once again raises the possibility that the order halting construction will ultimately be held to be arbitrary and capricious.</p>
<p>For now, however, the courts are largely offering the wind projects relief because the ruling was issued without any warning or communication from the government and would clearly inflict substantial harm on the companies building them. The injunction blocks the government’s hold on construction until a final ruling is issued. The government can still appeal the decision before that point, but the consistency among these rulings suggests it will likely fail.</p>
<p>Several of these projects are near completion and are likely to be done before any government appeal can be heard.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://forums.ankiweb.net/t/ankis-growing-up/68610">https://forums.ankiweb.net/t/ankis-growing-up/68610</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46861313">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
              <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>We initially reached out to <a href="https://forums.ankiweb.net/u/dae">@dae</a> to explore collaborating more closely on improving Anki. We were both humbled and shocked when he asked if we’d be willing to step into a much larger leadership role than we expected.</p>
<p>At this point, we’re mostly excited…and also feeling a healthy amount of terror. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sweat_smile.png?v=15" title=":sweat_smile:" alt=":sweat_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> This is a big responsibility. It will push us to grow as individuals, as <a href="https://www.ankihub.net/about-us">a team</a>, and as a community, and we don’t take that lightly.</p>
<p>We’re grateful for the trust Damien and others have placed in us. And we also know that trust has to be earned, especially from people who don’t know us yet.</p>
<h3><a name="p-190509-what-we-believe-1" href="#p-190509-what-we-believe-1" aria-label="Heading link"></a>What We Believe</h3>
<p>We believe Anki is almost sacred, something bigger than any one person or organization. In an important sense, it belongs to the community.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/intellectual-elegance-damien-elmes-dr-cary-woods-t3nuf/">This article</a> highlights the principles Damien built Anki on; <a href="https://resonantcomputing.org/">principles</a> we deeply share, such as respect for user agency, refusal of manipulative design patterns, and an emphasis on the craft of building genuinely useful tools that aren’t <em>merely</em> engaging. Anki has never tried to maximize “engagement” by exploiting psychological vulnerabilities purely for profit. <strong>Anki gives your time <em>back</em> to you</strong>, and that is an exceptional rarity in this world that we want to preserve.</p>
<p>As an organization built by students, for students, our mission is to continue embodying these principles. We are accountable only to you, our users, not external investors, and we plan to keep it that way.</p>
<h3><a name="p-190509-what-we-dont-know-yet-2" href="#p-190509-what-we-dont-know-yet-2" aria-label="Heading link"></a>What We Don’t Know Yet</h3>
<p>We can’t answer every question right away, as there are many unknowns since much hasn’t been decided yet. But we are sharing everything we can now because the community is important to us. We encourage you all to share your thoughts and questions – we’re all in this together!</p>
<p>We’re still working through the details on things like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Governance and decision-making</strong>: How decisions are made, who has final say, and how the community is heard</li>
<li><strong>Roadmap and priorities</strong>: What gets built when and how to balance competing needs</li>
<li><strong>The transition itself</strong>: How to bring in more support without disrupting what already works</li>
</ul>
<p>Anki has shown how powerful community collaboration can be when it’s genuinely a group effort, and that’s a tradition we are honored to continue.</p>
<p>We’re currently talking to <a href="https://github.com/david-allison/">David Allison</a>, a long-time core contributor to <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ichi2.anki">AnkiDroid</a>, about working together on exactly these questions. His experience with AnkiDroid’s collaborative development is invaluable, and we’re grateful he’s willing to help us get this right. <strong>We’re incredibly excited to have him join us <em>full-time</em> to help propel Anki into the future.</strong></p>
<h3><a name="p-190509-what-were-aiming-for-3" href="#p-190509-what-were-aiming-for-3" aria-label="Heading link"></a>What We’re Aiming For</h3>
<p><strong>UI/UX improvements.</strong> We’re bringing professional design expertise on board to make it more approachable without sacrificing Anki’s power. We believe that principled design will bring meaningful quality of life improvements to power users and novices alike.</p>
<p><strong>Addressing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor">bus factor</a>.</strong> The ecosystem shouldn’t be in jeopardy if any one person disappears. We want to build software that lives beyond any single contributor.</p>
<p><strong>Supporting more than just med students.</strong> AnkiHub grew out of the medical education community, but Anki serves learners from all walks of life, and we want to support everyone to achieve their learning goals.</p>
<p><strong>A more robust add-on ecosystem.</strong> We’d love to build tools that empower <em>non-technical</em> users to customize Anki for their needs, and we’re exploring add-ons that work everywhere, including mobile.</p>
<h3><a name="p-190509-how-well-work-4" href="#p-190509-how-well-work-4" aria-label="Heading link"></a>How We’ll Work</h3>
<p>We want to provide transparency into the decision-making process, taking inspiration from <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-8002">proven models</a> to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Give the community clarity on how to be heard and give feedback</li>
<li>Make it clear how decisions are made and why</li>
<li>Set realistic expectations</li>
<li>Define roles and responsibilities so things don’t fall through the cracks</li>
</ul>
<p>We want to bring everyone in the global Anki community together into a closer collaboration focused on building the best learning tools possible. Today, these groups often work in silos; a more unified process will help everyone move Anki forward together.</p>
<h3><a name="p-190509-sustainability-5" href="#p-190509-sustainability-5" aria-label="Heading link"></a>Sustainability</h3>
<p>Some practical reassurances:</p>
<p><strong>Sustainability, affordability, and accessibility.</strong> We’re committed to a sustainable business model that keeps Anki accessible and prioritizes user needs above profits. If anything ever needs to change, we’ll be transparent about why.</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/poop.png?v=15" title=":poop:" alt=":poop:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> No enshittification.</strong> We’ve seen what happens when VC-backed companies acquire beloved tools. That’s not what this is. There are no investors involved, and we’re not here to extract value from something the community built together. Building in the right safeguards and processes to handle pressure without stifling necessary improvements is something we’re actively considering.</p>
<p>We’re grateful to Damien et all for their trust and support, and grateful to all of you for the passion that makes this community so special.</p>
<p>We welcome your questions, concerns, and feedback.</p>
<p><img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/beating_heart.png?v=15" title=":beating_heart:" alt=":beating_heart:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> – <a href="https://www.ankihub.net/about-us">The AnkiHub Team</a></p>
<h2><a name="p-190509-faqs-6" href="#p-190509-faqs-6" aria-label="Heading link"></a>FAQs</h2>
<h2><a name="p-190509-what-is-ankihub-7" href="#p-190509-what-is-ankihub-7" aria-label="Heading link"></a>What is AnkiHub?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ankihub.net/about-us">AnkiHub</a> is a small education technology company founded by two long-time Anki nerds: Nick, a resident physician known as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/theanking">The AnKing</a>, and Andrew Sanchez, a research software engineer. AnkiHub grew out of years of obsessive Anki use and firsthand experience with both its power and its limitations.</p>
<p><a href="https://ankihub.net/">AnkiHub</a> began as a way to collaborate on Anki decks (such as the <a href="https://www.ankihub.net/step-deck">AnKing Step Deck</a> for medical students) and has since evolved into a broader effort to improve the Anki ecosystem by building tools that help more people benefit from Anki.</p>
<h2><a name="p-190509-will-anki-remain-open-source-8" href="#p-190509-will-anki-remain-open-source-8" aria-label="Heading link"></a>Will Anki remain open source?</h2>
<p>Absolutely. Anki’s core code will remain open source, guided by the same principles that have guided the project from the beginning.</p>
<h2><a name="p-190509-are-there-any-changes-planned-to-ankis-pricing-9" href="#p-190509-are-there-any-changes-planned-to-ankis-pricing-9" aria-label="Heading link"></a>Are there any changes planned to Anki’s pricing?</h2>
<p>No. We are committed to fair pricing that supports users rather than exploiting them. Both Anki and AnkiHub are already profitable. Any future decisions will be made with community benefit, user value, and long-term project health in mind.</p>
<h2><a name="p-190509-is-anki-in-financial-trouble-10" href="#p-190509-is-anki-in-financial-trouble-10" aria-label="Heading link"></a>Is Anki in financial trouble?</h2>
<p>No. The transition is driven by the goal of helping Anki reach its full potential, not by financial issues. Our goal is to build a resilient structure and accelerate development.</p>
<h2><a name="p-190509-what-is-the-timeline-11" href="#p-190509-what-is-the-timeline-11" aria-label="Heading link"></a>What is the timeline?</h2>
<p>Our intention is to build confidence and earn trust while making gradual changes. The transition will be transparent, with clear communication throughout.</p>
<h2><a name="p-190509-what-happens-to-volunteer-contributors-and-community-developers-12" href="#p-190509-what-happens-to-volunteer-contributors-and-community-developers-12" aria-label="Heading link"></a>What happens to volunteer contributors and community developers?</h2>
<p>Volunteer contributors will always be essential to Anki. Our goal is to make it easier to collaborate meaningfully.</p>
<h2><a name="p-190509-will-the-mobile-apps-change-or-be-removed-from-the-app-stores-13" href="#p-190509-will-the-mobile-apps-change-or-be-removed-from-the-app-stores-13" aria-label="Heading link"></a>Will the mobile apps change or be removed from the app stores?</h2>
<p>The mobile apps will continue to be maintained and supported. Additional development capacity should help with faster updates, better testing, and more consistent improvements across platforms over time.</p>
<h2><a name="p-190509-how-much-influence-will-investors-or-external-partners-have-on-anki-after-the-transition-14" href="#p-190509-how-much-influence-will-investors-or-external-partners-have-on-anki-after-the-transition-14" aria-label="Heading link"></a>How much influence will investors or external partners have on Anki after the transition?</h2>
<p>None. Both Anki and AnkiHub are entirely self-funded. There are no outside investors dictating product decisions, growth targets, or monetization strategy.</p>
<h2><a name="p-190509-what-will-happen-with-ankihub-15" href="#p-190509-what-will-happen-with-ankihub-15" aria-label="Heading link"></a>What will happen with AnkiHub?</h2>
<p>AnkiHub will continue to operate as usual, but now our teams are working together to improve both solutions. The only change you should notice is that, over time, everything becomes much easier to use.</p>
<p>We’ll share more updates as they happen in the future.</p>
<h2><a name="p-190509-what-will-happen-with-the-current-ankihub-subscriptions-16" href="#p-190509-what-will-happen-with-the-current-ankihub-subscriptions-16" aria-label="Heading link"></a>What will happen with the current AnkiHub subscriptions?</h2>
<p>AnkiHub subscriptions enhance Anki with collaborative features, shared deck syncing, and LLM-based features and that isn’t changing at this time.</p>
<h2><a name="p-190509-what-will-happen-with-ankidroid-17" href="#p-190509-what-will-happen-with-ankidroid-17" aria-label="Heading link"></a>What will happen with AnkiDroid?</h2>
<p>AnkiDroid will remain an open-source, self-governed project. There are no plans or agreements regarding AnkiDroid.</p>
<h2><a name="p-190509-how-will-decisions-be-made-and-communicated-18" href="#p-190509-how-will-decisions-be-made-and-communicated-18" aria-label="Heading link"></a>How will decisions be made and communicated?</h2>
<p>Anki is open-source, and we will build on and improve its current decision-making processes. We will work in public whenever possible and seek consensus from core contributors. Significant decisions, choices, and their outcomes will be documented on GitHub or in the source code. When a change materially affects users or developers, the reasoning behind it and its impact will be communicated publicly. In the coming weeks, we will work on defining a more formal governance model to set clear expectations.</p>
<h2><a name="p-190509-will-there-be-a-public-governance-model-advisory-board-or-other-accountability-structure-19" href="#p-190509-will-there-be-a-public-governance-model-advisory-board-or-other-accountability-structure-19" aria-label="Heading link"></a>Will there be a public governance model, advisory board, or other accountability structure?</h2>
<p>We’re exploring what makes sense here, and we don’t want to rush it.</p>
<p>Historically, Anki has relied more on trust and stewardship than on formal governance. We want to preserve that spirit while improving transparency. Our goal is to establish a governance structure that supports the community and improves clarity and accountability without burdensome bureaucracy.</p>
<h2><a name="p-190509-how-will-the-transition-affect-add-ons-and-their-developers-20" href="#p-190509-how-will-the-transition-affect-add-ons-and-their-developers-20" aria-label="Heading link"></a>How will the transition affect add-ons and their developers?</h2>
<p>Add-ons are a critical part of the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Our intent is to make life easier for add-on developers: clearer APIs, better documentation, fewer breaking changes, and more predictable release cycles. The goal is not to lock down or restrict the add-on space, but rather to enhance it.</p>
<h2><a name="p-190509-what-new-resources-will-anki-gain-through-this-transition-21" href="#p-190509-what-new-resources-will-anki-gain-through-this-transition-21" aria-label="Heading link"></a>What new resources will Anki gain through this transition?</h2>
<p>The biggest change is bandwidth by enabling more people to work on Anki without everything being bottlenecked through a single person. This will take time, but will eventually translate into more engineering, <em><strong>design</strong></em>, and support capacity.</p>
<h2><a name="p-190509-what-steps-will-be-taken-to-make-anki-more-accessible-stable-and-beginner-friendly-22" href="#p-190509-what-steps-will-be-taken-to-make-anki-more-accessible-stable-and-beginner-friendly-22" aria-label="Heading link"></a>What steps will be taken to make Anki more accessible, stable, and beginner-friendly?</h2>
<p>There is a lot of low-hanging fruit that we plan to tackle: improving onboarding for new users, polishing rough edges, and addressing long-standing usability issues. These are exactly the kinds of improvements that have been difficult to tackle under constant time pressure, and we’re excited to invest in them.</p>
<h2><a name="p-190509-will-community-feedback-still-meaningfully-influence-the-projects-direction-23" href="#p-190509-will-community-feedback-still-meaningfully-influence-the-projects-direction-23" aria-label="Heading link"></a>Will community feedback still meaningfully influence the project’s direction?</h2>
<p>Yes. Anki exists because of its community: users, contributors, add-on developers, translators, and educators. Feedback won’t always translate into immediate changes, but it will always be heard, considered, and respected.</p>
<h2><a name="p-190509-how-will-trust-be-built-with-users-who-are-skeptical-or-anxious-about-the-change-24" href="#p-190509-how-will-trust-be-built-with-users-who-are-skeptical-or-anxious-about-the-change-24" aria-label="Heading link"></a>How will trust be built with users who are skeptical or anxious about the change?</h2>
<p>Trust isn’t something you demand; it’s something you earn over time. We intend to build trust through consistent actions: honoring commitments, avoiding surprises, communicating clearly, and demonstrating that Anki’s values haven’t changed. We hope our past actions will give you some peace of mind, but we also understand the skepticism, and we’re prepared to meet it with patience and transparency.</p>

<p>Most people believe 2<sup>64</sup>-1 = 18446744073709551615, or
0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF in hexadecimal, to be the largest number
representable in 64 bits. In English, it’s quite the mouthful: eighteen
quintillion four hundred forty-six quadrillion seven hundred forty-four
trillion seventy-three billion seven hundred nine million five hundred
fifty-one thousand six hundred fifteen.</p>

<p>That is indeed the maximum possible value of 64 bit unsigned integers,
available as data type uint64_t in C or u64 in Rust. 
Floating point data types can represent much larger values, courtesy of their base 2 exponent.
The 64-bit double <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format">floating
point format</a> has a largest (finite) representable value of 2<sup>1024</sup>(1-2<sup>-53</sup>) ~ 1.8*10<sup>308</sup>.</p>

<p>What if we allow representations beyond plain data types?
Since we want representations to remain computable, the most general
kind of representation would be a program in some programming language.
But the program must be small enough to fit in 64 bits.</p>

<h2 id="the-largest-number-programmable-in-64-bits">The largest number programmable in 64 bits</h2>

<p>The smallest possible valid C program is “main(){}”,
consisting of 8 ASCII characters.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII</a> is a 7-bit
character encoding standard representing 128 unique characters,
but all modern computers use 8-bit bytes to store either plain ASCII
or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8">UTF-8</a>, a Unicode character encoding that’s backward compatible with
ASCII.  So we’ll consider the above all-scaffold do-nothing program to
be the only valid 64-bit C program.</p>

<p>Plenty other languages require no such scaffolding. For instance,
Linux features the arbitrary precision calculator
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bc_(programming_language)">bc</a>. It happily
computes the 954242 digit number 9^999999 = 35908462…48888889, making
it programmable in 8 bytes. So is the much larger 9^9^9^99 =
9^(9^(9^99)) with over 10^10^953 digits, which bc is less happy to
compute. If bc supported the symbol&nbsp;! for computing factorials, then
9!!!!!!! would represent a much larger number still.</p>

<p>Allowing such primitives feels a bit like cheating though. Would we allow a
language that has the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackermann_function">Ackerman function</a>
predefined, letting the 8 byte expression ack(9,9) represent a truly huge number?</p>

<h2 id="ackerman-considered-unhelpful">Ackerman considered unhelpful</h2>

<p>As it turns out, the question is moot.
One can blow way past ack(9,9) in under 64 bits in a language with no built
in primitive whatsoever. A language with no basic arithmetic; not even numbers themselves.
A language in which all those must be defined from scratch.</p>

<p>But let’s first look at another primitives-lacking language, one that has been particularly
well studied for producing largest possible outputs. That is the language of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine">Turing machines</a>.</p>

<h2 id="busy-beaver">Busy Beaver</h2>

<p>The famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_beaver">Busy Beaver</a>
 function, <a href="https://archive.org/details/bstj41-3-877/mode/2up">introduced</a> by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibor_Rad%C3%B3">Tibor Radó</a> in 1962, which we’ll
denote BB(n), is defined as the maximal number of steps taken by
an n-state Turing Machine (TM) with a binary tape alphabet,
starting from an all 0 tape, before halting.</p>

<p>Here we have a discrepancy between how the size of a TM is measured, in states,
versus how program size is measured, in bits.
Fortunately there is a straightforward binary encoding of n-state TMs,
which is entirely determined by its transition function.
For each of the n states that the machine’s finite control can be in,
and each of its 2 tape symbols that could be scanned by its tape head,
the transition function specifies what new symbol to write in the scanned tape cell (1 bit),
whether to move the tape head left or right (1 bit),
and what new state (or special halt state) to transition to (⌈log2(n+1)⌉ bits).
This encoding takes 6*2*(2+3) = 60 bits for a a 6-state TM,
and 7*2*(2+3) = 70 bits for a a 7-state TM.</p>

<p>We’re also stretching the meaning of “representable” a bit,
since BB considers the runtime of the machine instead of its output.
Besides the above BB (that Radó called S), Radó did define another
function called Σ that considers the output of the machine as a number in unary,
namely the number of 1s in the final tape contents. But BB has received
more attention as it allows one to determine from BB(n) all halting n-state machines.
For 6-states and up though, there is no discernable difference in magnitude between the two functions
so we could have just as easily used Σ.</p>

<p>So the largest number TM programmable in 64 bits is BB(6).</p>

<h2 id="how-large-is-bb6">How large is BB(6)?</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, we may never know. While all BB(n) have been determined (and even
formally proven) for n≤5, there are some 6-state TMs whose halting behaviour are
closely related to very hard mathematical problems.
Most of these so-called <a href="https://wiki.bbchallenge.org/wiki/Cryptids">cryptids</a>
are likely not to halt, with some,
like <a href="https://wiki.bbchallenge.org/wiki/Lucy%27s_Moonlight">Lucy’s Moonlight</a>,
likely to halt but unlikely to beat the current champion.
The current 6-state champion shows that
<a href="https://wiki.bbchallenge.org/wiki/BB(6)">BB(6) &gt; 2↑↑2↑↑2↑↑10 </a>.
Here, m↑↑n is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_up-arrow_notation">Knuth’s up-arrow notation</a>
for an exponential tower of n m’s, so that for example 2↑↑3 = 2<sup>2<sup>2</sup></sup>.
Large as this number is, it’s still very small compared to
ack(9,9) = 2↑<sup>7</sup>12 - 3 = 2↑↑↑↑↑↑↑12 - 3.</p>

<p>It is known however that
<a href="https://wiki.bbchallenge.org/wiki/BB(7)">BB(7) &gt; 2↑<sup>11</sup>2↑<sup>11</sup>3 &gt; ack(9,9) </a>.
Several leading BB researchers believe that BB(7) is even larger than the famous
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham%27s_number">Graham’s Number</a>, which iterates
the function mapping n to 3↑<sup>n</sup>3 64 times starting from n=3.
This appears to me a rather bold belief, considering that the smallest known Graham exceeding TM has
<a href="https://wiki.bbchallenge.org/wiki/Champions">14 states</a>, twice as many.
So I offered a $1000 bet that a proof of BB(7) &gt; Graham’s Number won’t be found within 10 years,
which BB researcher <a href="https://www.sligocki.com/about/">Shawn Ligocki</a> was happy to accept.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Graham’s Number is easily surpassed within 64 bits, by moving beyond Turing machines
into the language of</p>

<h2 id="lambda-calculus">Lambda Calculus</h2>

<p>Alonzo Church conceived the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">λ-calculus</a>
in about 1928 as a formal logic system for expressing
computation based on function abstraction and application using variable binding and substitution.</p>

<p>The Graham beating lambda term originates in a Code Golf challenge asking for the
“Shortest terminating program whose output size exceeds Graham’s number”,
<a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/6430/shortest-terminating-program-whose-output-size-exceeds-grahams-number/219734#219734">answered</a>

The following 49 bit program</p>

<div><pre><code>01 00 01 10 10 00 01 10 01 10 00 00 01 01 10 110 00 00 01 110 01 110 10

<div><pre><code>(λ 1 1) (λ 1 (1 (λ λ 1 2 (λ λ 2 (2 1)))))
</code></pre></div>
<p>where λ (lambda) denotes an anonymous function, and number i is the variable bound by the i-th nested λ.
This is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn_notation">De Bruijn notation</a>, a
way to avoid naming variables. A more conventional notation using variable names would be</p>
<div><pre><code>(λJ.J J) (λy.y (y (λg λm. m g (λf.λx.f (f x)))))
</code></pre></div>
<p>The top left of this post shows a <a href="https://tromp.github.io/cl/diagrams.html">graphical representation</a> of the term.
The last 16 bits of the program, making up almost a third of its size, encodes
the term λf λx. f (f x), which takes arguments f and x in turn, and iterates f twice on x.
In its generalized form, the function λf λx. f<sup>n</sup> x, 
called Church numeral n, is the most common way of representing numbers in the λ-calculus.
The encoding of Church numeral n is 0000(01110)<sup>n</sup>10, of size 5n+6 bits.</p>

<p>The program, which we’ll name after its discoverer, can be expressed more legibly as</p>

<div><pre><code>Melo = let { 2 = λf λx. f (f x); H = λg λm. m g 2; J = λy. y (y H) } in J J
</code></pre></div>

<p>Melo evaluates to a Church numeral, “Melo’s Number”, that comfortably exceeds Graham’s Number.</p>

<p>These 2↑↑18 iterations of A also let us relate its magnitude to the so-called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast-growing_hierarchy">Fast-growing hierarchy</a>,
a family that assigns, to each ordinal α, a function [α] (diverting from the usual f<sub>α</sub>
notation for improved legibility) from natural numbers to natural numbers.
We’ll treat all numbers as Church Numerals, so we can write n f instead of the
usual f<sup>n</sup> and write f n instead of f(n) as normally done in λ-calculus.</p>

<p>The following FGH definition differs slightly from the standard one,
which has the slightly slower growing [0] n = n+1 and [α+1] n = n [α] n.
This allows Lemma 5 to be exact rather than a mere lower bound.</p>

In comparison, Graham’s and Melo’s Numbers are known to be much smaller at around [ω+1] 64 and [ω+1] (2↑↑6)
respectively.</p>

<h2 id="a-functional-busy-beaver">A Functional Busy Beaver</h2>

<p>The λ-calculus analogue to BB is:</p>

<p>BBλ(n) = the maximum beta normal form size of any closed lambda term of size n</p>

<p>which appears in the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as
<a href="https://oeis.org/A333479">functional Busy Beaver function</a>
Besides being simpler than BB, it has the advantage of using the standard unit of information theory,
bits, rather than states.</p>

<p>The much more fine-grained use of bits allows the first 36 values of BBλ 
to be currently known, versus only 5 values of BB.</p>

<p>Since both are Church numerals, term Melo implies that BBλ(49) ≥ 5(Melo’s Number)+6,
while w218 implies that BBλ(61) ≥ 5(2^2^2^2^2^2^2^([ω<sup>2↑↑18-1</sup>] 2))+6.</p>

<h2 id="bb-compared-bit-by-bit-to-bbλ">BB compared bit-by-bit to BBλ</h2>

<p>The growth rates of the two BB functions may be compared by how quickly they are known
to exceed certain large number milestones, that correspond to well known ordinals in the
Fast Growing Hierarchy.</p>

<p>For Graham’s Number, at ordinal ω+1, we saw earlier that Melo’s 49 bits compares with 14 states,
which take 14*2*(2+4) = 168 bits to encode. If I lose my bet, then the comparison
becomes rather closer at 49 vs 70 bits.</p>

<p>For <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodstein%27s_theorem">Goodstein’s function</a> at ordinal ε<sub>0</sub>,
<a href="https://github.com/tromp/AIT/blob/master/fast_growing_and_conjectures/BBE0.lam">111
bits</a>
compares with <a href="https://wiki.bbchallenge.org/wiki/Champions">51 states</a> taking 51*2*(2+6) = 816 bits.</p>

<p>For the limit of Bashicu Matrix System (BMS), at (presumed) ordinal PTO(Z<sub>2</sub>),
<a href="https://github.com/tromp/AIT/blob/master/fast_growing_and_conjectures/bms.lam">331 bits</a>
compares with <a href="https://morphett.info/turing/turing.html">150 states</a> taking 150*2*(2+8) = 3000 bits.</p>

<p>Finally, for Loader’s Number, at (presumed) ordinal PTO(Z<sub>ω</sub>),
<a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/176966/golf-a-number-bigger-than-loaders-number/274634#274634">1850
bits</a>
compares with <a href="https://github.com/CatsAreFluffy/metamath-turing-machines/tree/master">1015 states
</a> taking 
1015*2*(2+10) = 24360 bits.</p>

<p>One reason for TMs taking many more bits to achieve comparable growth,
especially at the larger milestones, is the extremely poor programmability of TMs.
The λ-calculus, despite its similar bare bones nature, doesn’t share this drawback.
Modern high level pure functional languages like <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>
are essentially just syntactically sugared λ-calculus,
with programmer friendly features like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_data_type">Algebraic Data Types</a>
translating directly through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mogensen%E2%80%93Scott_encoding">Scott encodings</a>.
The <a href="https://bruijn.marvinborner.de/">bruijn programming language</a> is an even
thinner layer of syntactic sugar for the pure untyped lambda calculus, whose
extensive <a href="https://bruijn.marvinborner.de/std/">standard library</a> contains many
datatypes and functions.
It is this excellent programmability of the λ-calculus that facilitated the construction 
of highly optimized programs for BMS and Loader’s.</p>

<p>Because programming a Turing machine is so impossibly tedious,
that people have resorted to implementing higher level languages like
<a href="https://github.com/sorear/metamath-turing-machines">Not-Quite-Laconic</a>
for writing nontrivial programs such as the TM that halts only upon
finding an inconstency in ZFC. The above 1015 state TM for exceeding Loader’s Number
even includes a λ-calculus interpreter written in NQL!</p>

<p>In his paper <a href="https://scottaaronson.com/papers/bb.pdf">The Busy Beaver Frontier</a>,
<a href="https://scottaaronson.com/">Scott Aaronson</a> tries to answer the question</p>
<h2 id="but-why-turing-machines">But why Turing machines?</h2>

<p>“For all their historic importance, haven’t Turing machines been completely superseded
by better alternatives—whether stylized assembly languages or various codegolf languages or Lisp?
As we’ll see, there is a reason why Turing machines were a slightly unfortunate choice
for the Busy Beaver game: namely, the loss incurred when we encode a state transition table
by a string of bits or vice versa.
But Turing machines also turn out to have a massive advantage that compensates for this.”</p>

<h3 id="interesting-behaviour-at-small-sizes">Interesting behaviour at small sizes</h3>

<p>“Namely, because Turing machines have no “syntax” to speak of, but only graph structure,
we immediately start seeing interesting behavior even with machines of only 3, 4, or 5 states,
which are feasible to enumerate.”</p>

<p>The number of uniquely behaving TMs with “only” 5 states is
4^10 * <a href="https://oeis.org/A107668">632700</a> = 663434035200 , which is more than
the number of closed lambda terms of size at most 52 bits (513217604750).
The latter certainly exhibit no less interesting behaviour, so TMs hold no advantage here.</p>

<h3 id="ancient-and-fixed-computational-model">Ancient and fixed computational model</h3>

<p>“And there’s a second advantage. Precisely because the Turing machine model is so ancient and fixed,
whatever emergent behavior we find in the Busy Beaver game, there can be no suspicion that
we “cheated” by changing the model until we got the results we wanted.”</p>

<p>The λ-calculus is just slightly more ancient and is arguably more fixed.
There is no choice of tape alphabet size, no choice of whether the tape head needs
to move in every transition, no choice of halting and output
convention, and no choice in number of tapes or tape heads.</p>

<p>The λ-calculus can neither be suspected of being designed toward fast growth,
so again TMs hold no advantage here.</p>

<p>The only remaining advantage of BB over BBλ is the many decades of research behind
and publications about it.</p>

<h2 id="a-universal-busy-beaver">A Universal Busy Beaver</h2>

<p>Is BBλ then an ideal Busy Beaver function? Not quite.
It’s still lacking one desirable property, namely universality.</p>

<p>This property mirrors a notion of optimality for shortest description lengths, where it’s known
as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity#Invariance_theorem">Invariance theorem</a>:</p>

<p>Given any description language L, L<sub>opt</sub>
  is at least as efficient as L, with at most constant additive overhead.</p>

<p>In the realm of beavers, this means we require of an optimal Busy Beaver BB<sub>opt</sub> that
it surpass any Busy Beaver function bb (based on self-delimiting programs) with at most constant lag:</p>

<p>for some constant c depending on bb, and for all n: BB<sub>opt</sub>(n+c) ≥ bb(n)</p>

<p>While BBλ is not universal, the closely related</p>

<p><a href="https://oeis.org/A361211">BBλ2</a>(n) = the maximum output size of self-delimiting BLC programs of size n</p>

<p>achieves universality by giving λ-calculus terms access to pure binary data. BLC programs
consist of an encoded lambda term, followed by arbitrary binary data, that the term is applied to.</p>

<p>Since (λ_. t) applied to any (standard lambda representation of) binary data equals t,
BBλ champions provide lower bounds for BBλ2: for all n, BBλ2(2+n) ≥ BBλ(n).</p>

<h2 id="in-conclusion">In conclusion</h2>

<p>The largest number (currently known to be) representable in 64 bits is w218,
which lower bounds both BBλ(61) and BBλ2(63).</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>The other week, I visited Syracuse, New York to meet with city officials and organizers about their land policies. Syracuse, despite its history of de-industrialization, still has a charming and nicely developed downtown. Nevertheless, Syracuse shares a problem endemic to most modern American cities: excessive parking lots in prime downtown locations.</p><p>This came as no surprise to me; at the Center for Land Economics I am constantly modeling urban areas across the United States, viewing them through the lens of property tax data records and GIS tools like Google Earth. So, in advance of my visit to Syracuse, I already knew what to expect. Walking Syracuse in person, I experienced the pervasiveness of parking lots that steadily drain economic opportunity away from the city’s most valuable locations.</p><p>A city is, among other things, a fixed plot of contiguous land. So too is its downtown–a “city within a city,” if you will.</p><p>In our downtowns, this fixed amount of land derives market value from its productive potential. If a plot of land can yield $10m a year if I develop on it, I would pay far more for it than a different plot capable of generating only a few thousand dollars. In a sensible market, we would expect development to track with the value of land (that is, the land’s selling price), because higher land selling prices imply higher annual returns from building on that land.</p><p>Yet, plenty of American downtowns look something like this:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1fir!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe3ea0857-fc3c-492e-a44a-9d1b1fc3c5fb_1142x759.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1fir!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe3ea0857-fc3c-492e-a44a-9d1b1fc3c5fb_1142x759.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1fir!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe3ea0857-fc3c-492e-a44a-9d1b1fc3c5fb_1142x759.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1fir!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe3ea0857-fc3c-492e-a44a-9d1b1fc3c5fb_1142x759.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1fir!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe3ea0857-fc3c-492e-a44a-9d1b1fc3c5fb_1142x759.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1fir!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe3ea0857-fc3c-492e-a44a-9d1b1fc3c5fb_1142x759.png" width="1142" height="759" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e3ea0857-fc3c-492e-a44a-9d1b1fc3c5fb_1142x759.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:759,&quot;width&quot;:1142,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1fir!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe3ea0857-fc3c-492e-a44a-9d1b1fc3c5fb_1142x759.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1fir!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe3ea0857-fc3c-492e-a44a-9d1b1fc3c5fb_1142x759.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1fir!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe3ea0857-fc3c-492e-a44a-9d1b1fc3c5fb_1142x759.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1fir!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe3ea0857-fc3c-492e-a44a-9d1b1fc3c5fb_1142x759.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>This is a simplified downtown featuring a mix of multifamily apartments and offices with rowhomes around the corner.

That is, how much value a parcel </span><em>creates</em><span> for the community compared to how much value it </span><em>consumes</em><span> simply by existing as land. Think of it like this:</span></p><p>Net Contribution=(Economic Output in $)−(Land Value in $)</p><p>The office, filled with workers and transactions, generates far more in economic activity and value creation than its land value and, therefore, rises the highest. The apartment, where dozens of residents live, stands nearly as high. The rowhomes add steady, smaller value. But the parking lot does something different. It dips below the surface, shown as a red bar sinking into the ground.</p><p>Why below ground? Because in economic terms, a parking lot doesn’t simply fail to add value; it actively subtracts value. Every year it sits idle, it consumes some of the most valuable land in the city.</p><p>When valuable downtown land lies idle, it blocks the housing, jobs, and amenities that could exist there. The costs ripple outward: higher rents, longer commutes, fewer opportunities nearby. What could have been a productive part of the community instead becomes a hole in its fabric.</p><p>In other words, the parking lot isn’t a neutral space. It’s a drain. It pulls the city’s potential downward, both visually and economically.</p><div><p><span>When diving through the property data in Syracuse, I found parking lots added up to $44 million in non-exempt land value–6% of the city’s total land value, and that’s only counting parcels where the sole use case was parking. There are plenty more commercial parcels with large parking lots not counted in that figure. </span></p><p><span>The most valuable land is concentrated in downtown, where the most economic activity occurs. Yet, from an aerial view in Google Earth you can see many large parking lots that should not exist in a bustling downtown area.</span></p></div><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eQk9!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2f217632-e141-4acb-8fcc-cb6a4e402708_1600x958.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eQk9!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2f217632-e141-4acb-8fcc-cb6a4e402708_1600x958.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eQk9!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2f217632-e141-4acb-8fcc-cb6a4e402708_1600x958.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eQk9!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2f217632-e141-4acb-8fcc-cb6a4e402708_1600x958.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eQk9!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2f217632-e141-4acb-8fcc-cb6a4e402708_1600x958.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eQk9!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2f217632-e141-4acb-8fcc-cb6a4e402708_1600x958.png" width="1456" height="872" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2f217632-e141-4acb-8fcc-cb6a4e402708_1600x958.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:872,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eQk9!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2f217632-e141-4acb-8fcc-cb6a4e402708_1600x958.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eQk9!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2f217632-e141-4acb-8fcc-cb6a4e402708_1600x958.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eQk9!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2f217632-e141-4acb-8fcc-cb6a4e402708_1600x958.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eQk9!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2f217632-e141-4acb-8fcc-cb6a4e402708_1600x958.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>We can zoom into one of these parking lots to really show the scale.

That facade was an old building with the interior gutted and re-purposed for a parking garage.</p><div><p><span>Parking reform has become a hot topic in many urban cities, led in part by the </span><a href="https://parkingreform.org/" rel="">Parking Reform Network</a><span>. They have focused their efforts primarily in three areas: </span></p><p><strong>1. Eliminate parking requirements: </strong><span>Many cities historically required developers to build a certain number of parking spaces per housing unit or square foot of retail. Removing these “minimums” lets builders decide how much parking is truly needed instead of top-down planning, reducing wasted land and construction costs.</span></p></div><p><strong>2. Establish parking maximums: </strong><span>In areas where land is especially valuable or where walkability and transit are strong, cities can instead set an upper limit on how much parking may be built. This prevents the over-supply of parking that undermines density and urban design.</span></p><p><strong>3. Smart street parking: </strong><span>Curbside spaces can be priced dynamically or managed with time limits and residential permits so that parking remains available but doesn’t encourage endless circling or long-term storage of cars in prime locations.</span></p><p><span>To date, PRN has plenty of success to boast about. This handy </span><a href="https://parkingreform.org/resources/mandates-map/" rel="">map</a><span> showcases 100+ recent parking reforms, many reflecting the policy changes outlined above. These policies are not only good, but also politically pragmatic. For instance, the mandating of minimum parking sizes seems particularly non-controversial. (Though, as with most policies, I’m sure I’d be surprised.)</span></p><p>However, in many of our urban cities the problem stretches beyond what these simple reforms are able to tackle. In the Syracuse examples, for instance, the parking lots are not caused by parking mandates from central planners. Instead, they are created by distorted incentives. Our question is how we can change those incentives.</p><p><span>A parking lot generates some revenue every year, but nothing like the revenue or profit the lot could generate were it developed. Why, then, don’t parking lot owners develop their land to its highest and best use? </span><br></p><p>The reason is because leaving the lot empty is easy–the parking lot owner generates steady revenue, and all the while the land underneath the parking lot continues to rise in value, yielding speculative gains. Meanwhile, the parking lot owner’s holding costs are small. Sure, they have to do the bare minimum to maintain a surface parking lot, and perhaps pay someone for staffing and enforcement, but otherwise their revenues are more than sufficient to cover the costs. Most importantly, their property taxes are far lower than if they developed the lot, as the property tax taxes both land and improvements.</p><p>The city must ask what incentives it creates. Zooming into the large parking lot in Syracuse, let’s look at the property taxes paid by the parking lot compared to the office and multifamily buildings, which are more productive structures for the city. The office building pays around $3.78 per square foot in taxes. The multifamily housing unit is a new development and pays around $1.68 per square foot through a payment in lieu of taxes, or PILOT, agreement (At normal tax rates it’d be paying more than the office) . Meanwhile, the parking lot pays nearly ten times less than either building at $0.71 per square foot.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!E8Mk!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd582b8de-d1d7-4ce9-a5ad-69cb472b91dc_1600x772.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!E8Mk!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd582b8de-d1d7-4ce9-a5ad-69cb472b91dc_1600x772.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!E8Mk!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd582b8de-d1d7-4ce9-a5ad-69cb472b91dc_1600x772.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!E8Mk!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd582b8de-d1d7-4ce9-a5ad-69cb472b91dc_1600x772.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!E8Mk!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd582b8de-d1d7-4ce9-a5ad-69cb472b91dc_1600x772.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!E8Mk!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd582b8de-d1d7-4ce9-a5ad-69cb472b91dc_1600x772.png" width="1456" height="703" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d582b8de-d1d7-4ce9-a5ad-69cb472b91dc_1600x772.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:703,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!E8Mk!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd582b8de-d1d7-4ce9-a5ad-69cb472b91dc_1600x772.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!E8Mk!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd582b8de-d1d7-4ce9-a5ad-69cb472b91dc_1600x772.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!E8Mk!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd582b8de-d1d7-4ce9-a5ad-69cb472b91dc_1600x772.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!E8Mk!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd582b8de-d1d7-4ce9-a5ad-69cb472b91dc_1600x772.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Our property tax policy punishes buildings and does not inflict enough cost on underutilized land.

  <p><span><strong>WASHINGTON</strong></span><span data-contrast="none"> – Today, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) advanced American farmers and equipment owners’ lawful right to repair their farm and other nonroad diesel equipment. EPA’s guidance to manufacturers clarifies that the Clean Air Act (CAA) supports, rather than restricts, Americans’ ability to make repairs on their own, and makes clear manufacturers can no longer use the CAA to justify limiting access to repair tools or software. For America’s farmers, timely and affordable repairs are essential to planting, harvesting, and keeping operations running.</span></p><p><em><span>“EPA is proud to set the record straight and protect farmers. For far too long, manufacturers have wrongly used the Clean Air Act to monopolize the repair markets, hurting our farmers,”&nbsp;<strong>said&nbsp;EPA&nbsp;Administrator&nbsp;Lee&nbsp;Zeldin</strong>. “Common sense is following the law as it is written, and that is what the Trump EPA is committed to doing. By protecting every American’s right to repair, we’re not just fixing devices, we’re securing a stronger, more independent future for our country.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>“This is another win for American farmers and ranchers by the Trump Administration. By clarifying manufacturers can no longer use the Clean Air Act to justify limiting access to repair tools or software, we are reaffirming&nbsp;the lawful right of American farmers and equipment owners to repair their farm equipment,” <strong>said Secretary of Agriculture Brooke L. Rollins</strong>. “Thank you, Administrator Zeldin, for continuing to put farmers first. This is expected to save our farmers thousands in unnecessary repairs, saving much needed funds after Bidenflation drove up equipment costs on average 45%.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>“EPA’s guidance affirming the Right to Repair will save our agricultural communities thousands of dollars by eliminating corporate middlemen and empowering farmers to fix their own equipment,”&nbsp;<strong>said Small Business Administrator Kelly Loeffler</strong>.&nbsp;“The Clean Air Act has long crushed family farmers across America – but under the Trump Administration, they are finally getting the regulatory relief to break free from burdensome Green New Scam rules and focus on the vital job of feeding, clothing, and fueling America and the world.”</span></em></p><p><span data-contrast="none">For years, prominent equipment manufacturers have interpreted the CAA’s emission control anti-tampering provisions as preventing them from making essential repair tools available to all Americans. This has forced farmers to take their equipment exclusively to manufacturer-authorized dealers to be fixed, even though the repair could have been made in the field or at a nearby independent repair shop. Not only has this made repairs more costly, but it has also caused many farmers to&nbsp;opt for older&nbsp;agricultural&nbsp;equipment&nbsp;that&nbsp;lack&nbsp;modern emission controls&nbsp;simply&nbsp;because they can&nbsp;fix&nbsp;that&nbsp;equipment themselves.</span></p><p><span data-contrast="none">EPA’s guidance does not change the law, weaken emission standards, or reduce compliance obligations. Rather, it clarifies what the CAA already states, that temporary overrides of emission control systems are allowed when it is for the “purpose of repair” to that equipment to obtain proper functionality. This clarification applies to all nonroad diesel engines equipped with advanced emission control technologies including selective catalytic reduction and inducement systems as well as Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) system repairs. Importantly, farmers and equipment owners are not required to rely on authorized dealers exclusively to fix equipment. This makes clear that the law should not serve as a barrier to timely, affordable maintenance of agricultural equipment.</span></p><p><span data-contrast="none">Today’s action will not only expand consumer choice and provide opportunities for farmers but also encourage the use of newer farm equipment. This underscores the agency’s commitment to both America’s farmers and EPA’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment.</span></p><p><span>To read EPA’s guidance, click </span><a href="https://dis.epa.gov/otaqpub/display_file.jsp?docid=64859&amp;flag=1"><span>here</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span data-contrast="none"><strong>Background</strong></span></p><p><span data-contrast="none">On June 3, 2025,&nbsp;John&nbsp;Deere sent a letter to EPA requesting the&nbsp;agency issue guidance&nbsp;confirming that&nbsp;temporary emission control overrides are allowed by EPA.&nbsp;The agency’s guidance is a direct response to this request and makes clear that temporary overrides are allowed under the CAA.</span></p><p><span data-contrast="none">On August 12, 2025, Administrator&nbsp;Zeldin&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/iowa-state-fair-epa-administrator-zeldin-announces-diesel-exhaust-fluid-def-fix"><span data-ccp-charstyle="Hyperlink" data-contrast="none">announced</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;new guidance urging engine and equipment manufacturers to revise DEF&nbsp;system software in existing vehicles and equipment.

The real world is not.</p><p data-block-key="c4ntb">Last year, Google DeepMind partnered with Kaggle to launch <a href="https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/products/kaggle-game-arena/">Game Arena</a>, an independent, public benchmarking platform where AI models compete in strategic games. We started with chess to measure reasoning and strategic planning. But in the real world, decisions are rarely based on complete information.</p><p data-block-key="c82lu">To build artificial intelligence capable of navigating this uncertainty, we need benchmarks that measure the model’s ability to reason in the face of ambiguity. This is why we are now expanding Game Arena with two new game benchmarks — Werewolf and poker — to test frontier models on social dynamics and calculated risk.</p><p data-block-key="4ni9a">Games have always been a core part of Google DeepMind’s history, offering an objective proving ground where difficulty scales with the level of competition. As AI systems become more general, mastering diverse games demonstrates their consistency across distinct cognitive skills. Beyond measuring performance, games can also serve as controlled sandbox environments to evaluate agentic safety, providing insight into model behavior in the complex environments they will encounter when deployed in the real world.</p></div>

To track how these model capabilities are evolving, we have updated the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/benchmarks/kaggle/chess">leaderboard</a> to include the latest generation of models.</p><p data-block-key="6pr3q">While traditional chess engines like Stockfish function as specialized super-calculators, evaluating millions of positions per second to find the optimal move, large language models do not approach the game through brute-force calculation. Instead, they rely on pattern recognition and ‘intuition’ to drastically reduce the search space — an approach that mirrors human play.</p><p data-block-key="anago">Gemini 3 Pro and Gemini 3 Flash currently have the top Elo ratings on the leaderboard. The models’ internal ‘thoughts’ reveal the use of strategic reasoning grounded in familiar chess concepts like piece mobility, pawn structure, and king safety. This significant performance increase over the Gemini 2.5 generation highlights the rapid pace of model progress and demonstrates Game Arena’s value in tracking these improvements over time.</p></div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>This page contains a curated list of recent changes to main branch Zig.</p><p>

        <p><span>January 31, 2026</span></p><h2><a href="#2026-01-31">zig libc
</a></h2>
        <p>Author: Andrew Kelley</p><p>Over the past month or so, several enterprising contributors have taken an interest in the <a href="https://codeberg.org/ziglang/zig/issues/30978" target="_blank">zig libc subproject</a>. The idea here is to incrementally delete redundant code, by providing libc functions as Zig standard library wrappers rather than as vendored C source files. In many cases, these functions are one-to-one mappings, such as <code>memcpy</code> or <code>atan2</code>, or trivially wrap a generic function, like <code>strnlen</code>:</p><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>strnlen</span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>*</span><span>:</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>const</span> <span>c_char</span><span>,</span> <span>max</span><span>:</span> <span>usize</span><span>)</span> <span>callconv</span><span>(</span><span>.</span><span>c</span><span>)</span> <span>usize</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>So far, roughly 250 C source files have been deleted from the Zig repository, with 2032 remaining.</p><p>With each function that makes the transition, Zig gains independence from third party projects and from the C programming language, compilation speed improves, Zig’s installation size is simplified and reduced, and user applications which statically link libc enjoy reduced binary size.</p><p>Additionally, a <a href="https://codeberg.org/ziglang/zig/pulls/31037" target="_blank">recent enhancement</a> now makes zig libc share the Zig Compilation Unit with other Zig code rather than being a separate static archive, linked together later. This is one of the advantages of Zig having an integrated compiler and linker. When the exported libc functions share the ZCU, redundant code is eliminated because functions can be optimized together. It’s kind of like enabling LTO (Link-Time Optimization) across the libc boundary, except it’s done properly in the frontend instead of too late, in the linker.</p><p>Furthermore, when this work is combined with the recent <a href="https://codeberg.org/ziglang/zig/issues/30150" target="_blank">std.Io changes</a>, there is potential for users to seamlessly control how libc performs I/O - for example forcing all calls to <code>read</code> and <code>write</code> to participate in an io_uring event loop, even though that code was not written with such use case in mind. Or, <a href="https://codeberg.org/ziglang/zig/pulls/30788" target="_blank">resource leak detection</a> could be enabled for third-party C code. For now this is only a vaporware idea which has not been experimented with, but the idea intrigues me.</p><p>Big thanks to Szabolcs Nagy for <a href="https://wiki.musl-libc.org/libc-test.html" target="_blank">libc-test</a>. This project has been a huge help in making sure that we don’t regress any math functions.</p><p>As a reminder to our users, now that Zig is transitioning to being the static libc provider, if you encounter issues with the musl, mingw-w64, or wasi-libc libc functionality provided by Zig, <strong>please file bug reports in Zig first</strong> so we don’t annoy maintainers for bugs that are in Zig, and no longer vendored by independent libc implementation projects.</p><p>Abolish ICE.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2><a id="what-is-moltbook-and-why-did-it-attract-our-attention-0"></a>What is Moltbook, and Why Did it Attract Our Attention?</h2><p>Moltbook, the weirdly futuristic social network, has quickly gone viral as a forum where AI agents post and chat. But what we discovered tells a different story - and provides a fascinating look into what happens when applications are vibe-coded into existence without proper security controls.</p><p>We identified a misconfigured Supabase database belonging to Moltbook, allowing full read and write access to all platform data. The exposure included 1.5 million API authentication tokens, 35,000 email addresses, and private messages between agents. We immediately disclosed the issue to the Moltbook team, who secured it within hours with our assistance, and all data accessed during the research and fix verification has been deleted.</p><h2><a id="executive-summary-3"></a><strong>Executive Summary</strong></h2><p>Moltbook is a social platform designed exclusively for AI agents - positioned as the "front page of the agent internet." The platform allows AI agents to post content, comment, vote, and build reputation through a karma system, creating what appears to be a thriving social network where AI is the primary participant.</p><figure><figcaption>Moltbook home page</figcaption></figure><p>Over the past few days, Moltbook gained <a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/karpathy/status/2017296988589723767?s=20"><u>significant attention in the AI community</u></a>. OpenAI founding member Andrej Karpathy described it as "genuinely the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently," noting how agents were "self-organizing on a Reddit-like site for AIs, discussing various topics, e.g. even how to speak privately."</p><p>The Moltbook founder <a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/mattprd/status/2017386365756072376?s=46&amp;t=JS55_O2JZmKWQpZHLAse_A"><u>explained publicly on X</u></a> that he "vibe-coded" the platform: </p><blockquote><p>I didn’t write a single line of code for @moltbook. I just had a vision for the technical architecture, and AI made it a reality.”</p></blockquote><p>This practice, while revolutionary, can lead to dangerous security oversights - similar to previous vulnerabilities we have identified, including the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wiz.io/blog/wiz-research-uncovers-exposed-deepseek-database-leak"><u>DeepSeek data leak</u></a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wiz.io/blog/critical-vulnerability-base44"><u>Base44 Authentication Bypass</u></a>.</p><p>We conducted a non-intrusive security review, simply by browsing like normal users. Within minutes, we discovered a Supabase API key exposed in client-side JavaScript, granting unauthenticated access to the entire production database - including read and write operations on all tables.</p><figure><figcaption>Accessible tables from the Supabase API Key</figcaption></figure><p>The exposed data told a different story than the platform's public image - while Moltbook boasted 1.5 million registered agents, the database revealed only 17,000 human owners behind them - an 88:1 ratio. Anyone <a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/galnagli/status/2017585025475092585?s=20"><u>could register millions of agents</u></a> with a simple loop and no rate limiting, and humans could post content disguised as "AI agents" via a <a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/galnagli/status/2017573842051334286?s=20"><u>basic POST request</u></a>. <strong>The platform had no mechanism to verify whether an "agent" was actually AI or just a human with a script.</strong> The revolutionary AI social network was largely humans operating fleets of bots.</p><figure><figcaption>an HTTP Post request to create new "agent" post in Moltbook's platform</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption>An "agent" post in Moltbook.</figcaption></figure><h2><a id="how-the-moltbook-database-was-exposed-15"></a>How the Moltbook Database Was Exposed</h2><h3><a id="discovery-of-exposed-supabase-credentials-16"></a><strong>Discovery of Exposed Supabase Credentials</strong></h3><p>When navigating to Moltbook's website, we examined the client-side JavaScript bundles loaded automatically by the page. Modern web applications bundle configuration values into static JavaScript files, which can inadvertently expose sensitive credentials. <strong>This is a recurring pattern we've observed in vibe-coded applications</strong> - API keys and secrets frequently end up in frontend code, visible to anyone who inspects the page source, often with significant security consequences.</p><p>By analyzing the production JavaScript file at -&nbsp;</p><p>https://www.moltbook.com/_next/static/chunks/18e24eafc444b2b9.js</p><p>We identified hardcoded Supabase connection details:</p><p>- <strong>Supabase Project</strong>: ehxbxtjliybbloantpwq.supabase.co</p><p>- <strong>API Key</strong>: sb_publishable_4ZaiilhgPir-2ns8Hxg5Tw_JqZU_G6-</p><figure><figcaption>One of the javascript files that power Moltbook main website</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption>The production supabase and API key hardcoded</figcaption></figure><p>The discovery of these credentials does not automatically indicate a security failure, as Supabase is designed to operate with certain keys exposed to the client - the real danger lies in the configuration of the backend they point to.<br>Supabase is a popular open-source Firebase alternative providing hosted PostgreSQL databases with REST APIs. It's become especially popular with vibe-coded applications due to its ease of setup. When properly configured with Row Level Security (RLS), the public API key is safe to expose - it acts like a project identifier. <strong>However, without RLS policies, this key grants full database access to anyone who has it.</strong>In Moltbook’s implementation, this critical line of defense was missing.</p><h3><a id="unauthenticated-database-access-via-supabase-api-26"></a><strong>Unauthenticated Database Access via Supabase API</strong></h3><p>Using the discovered API key, we tested whether the recommended security measures were in place. We attempted to query the REST API directly - a request that should have returned an empty array or an authorization error if RLS were active.</p><p>Instead, the database responded exactly as if we were an administrator. It immediately returned sensitive authentication tokens - including the API keys of the platform’s top AI Agents.</p><figure><figcaption>Redacted API keys of the Platform's top AI Agents</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption>List of most popular Agents</figcaption></figure><p>This confirmed unauthenticated access to user credentials that would allow complete account impersonation of any user on the platform.</p><h3><a id="database-enumeration-through-postgrest-and-graphql-33"></a><strong>Database Enumeration Through PostgREST and GraphQL</strong></h3><p>By leveraging Supabase's PostgREST error messages, we enumerated additional tables. Querying non-existent table names returned hints revealing the actual schema.</p><figure></figure><p>Using this technique combined with GraphQL introspection, we mapped the complete database schema and found around ~4.75 million records exposed.</p><figure><figcaption>Identified tables through the technique described above</figcaption></figure><h2><a id="sensitive-data-exposed-in-the-moltbook-database-39"></a><strong>Sensitive Data Exposed in the Moltbook Database</strong></h2><p>1. <strong>API Keys and Authentication Tokens for AI Agents</strong></p><p>The agents table exposed authentication credentials for every registered agent in the database</p><p>Each agent record contained:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;- api_key - Full authentication token allowing complete account takeover</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;- claim_token - Token used to claim ownership of an agent</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;- verification_code - Code used during agent registration</p><p>With these credentials, an attacker could <strong>fully impersonate any agent on the platform</strong> - posting content, sending messages, and interacting as that agent. This included high-karma accounts and well-known persona agents. Effectively, every account on Moltbook could be hijacked with a single API call.</p><p>2. <strong>User Email Addresses and Identity Data</strong></p><p>The owners table contained personal information for 17,000+ users</p><figure><figcaption>How exposed emails looked like in the raw data</figcaption></figure><p>Additionally, by querying the GraphQL endpoint, we discovered a new observers table containing 29,631 additional email addresses - these were early access signups for Moltbook's upcoming “Build Apps for AI Agents” product.</p><figure><figcaption>Additional tables from Moltbook's new developers product</figcaption></figure><p>Unlike Twitter handles which were publicly displayed on profiles, email addresses were meant to stay private - but were fully exposed in the database.</p><p>3. <strong>Private Messages &amp; Third-Party Credential Leaks</strong></p><p>The agent_messages table exposed 4,060 private DM conversations between agents.</p><p>While examining this table to understand agent-to-agent interactions, we discovered that <strong>conversations were stored without any encryption or access controls</strong> -- some contained third-party API credentials, including plaintext OpenAI API keys shared between agents.</p><figure><figcaption>Agent to Agent interaction summary</figcaption></figure><p>4. <strong>Write Access - Modifying Live Posts</strong></p><p>Beyond read access, we confirmed full write capabilities. Even after the initial fix that blocked read access to sensitive tables, write access to public tables remained open. We tested it and were able to successfully modify existing posts on the platform.</p><p>Proving that any unauthenticated user could:</p><p>&nbsp;- Edit any post on the platform</p><p>&nbsp;- Inject malicious content or prompt injection payloads</p><p>&nbsp;- Deface the entire website</p><p>&nbsp;- Manipulate content consumed by thousands of AI agents</p><p>This raises questions about<strong> the integrity of all platform content</strong> - posts, votes, and karma scores - during the exposure window.</p><figure><figcaption>Modified post on Moltbook</figcaption></figure><figure></figure><p>We promptly notified the team again to apply write restrictions via RLS policies.</p><p>Once the fix was confirmed, I could no longer revert the post as write access was blocked. The Moltbook team deleted the content a few hours later and thanked us for our report.</p><h2><a id="5-key-security-lessons-for-ai-built-apps-72"></a><strong>5 Key Security Lessons for AI-Built Apps</strong></h2><p><strong>#1. Speed Without Secure Defaults Creates Systemic Risk</strong></p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.wiz.io/blog/safer-vibe-coding-rules-files"><u>Vibe coding</u></a> unlocks remarkable speed and creativity, enabling founders to ship real products with unprecedented velocity - as demonstrated by Moltbook. At the same time, today’s <strong>AI tools don’t yet reason about security posture or access controls on a developer’s behalf</strong>, which means configuration details still benefit from careful human review. In this case, the issue ultimately traced back to a single Supabase configuration setting - a reminder of how small details can matter at scale.</p><p><strong>#2.&nbsp; Participation Metrics Need Verification and Guardrails</strong></p><p>The 88:1 agent-to-human ratio shows how "agent internet" metrics can be easily inflated without guardrails like rate limits or identity verification.<strong> While Moltbook reported 1.5 million agents, these were associated with roughly 17,000 human accounts, an average of about 88 agents per person</strong>. At the time of our review, there were limited guardrails such as rate limiting or validation of agent autonomy. Rather than a flaw, this likely reflects how early the “agent internet” category still is: builders are actively exploring what agent identity, participation, and authenticity should look like, and the supporting mechanisms are still evolving.</p><p><strong>#3. Privacy Breakdowns Can Cascade Across AI Ecosystems</strong></p><p>Similarly, the platform’s approach to privacy highlights an important ecosystem-wide lesson. Users shared OpenAI API keys and other credentials in direct messages under the assumption of privacy, but a configuration issue made those messages publicly accessible. A single platform misconfiguration was enough to expose credentials for entirely unrelated services - underscoring how interconnected modern AI systems have become.</p><p><strong>#4. Write Access Introduces Far Greater Risk Than Data Exposure Alone</strong></p><p>While data leaks are bad, the ability to modify content and inject prompts into an AI ecosystem introduces deeper integrity risks, including content manipulation, narrative control, and prompt injection that can propagate downstream to other AI agents. As AI-driven platforms grow, these distinctions become increasingly important design considerations.</p><p><strong>#5. Security Maturity is an Iterative Process</strong></p><p>Security, especially in fast-moving AI products, is rarely a one-and-done fix. <strong>We worked with the team through multiple rounds of remediation</strong>, with each iteration surfacing additional exposed surfaces: from sensitive tables, to write access, to GraphQL-discovered resources. This kind of iterative hardening is common in new platforms and reflects how security maturity develops over time.</p><p>Overall, Moltbook illustrates both the excitement and the growing pains of a brand-new category. The enthusiasm around AI-native social networks is well-founded, but the underlying systems are still catching up. The most important outcome here is not what went wrong, but what the ecosystem can learn as builders, researchers, and platforms collectively define the next phase of AI-native applications.</p><h2><a id="closing-thoughts-on-vibe-coding-and-security-84"></a><strong>Closing Thoughts on Vibe Coding and Security</strong></h2><p>As AI continues to lower the barrier to building software, more builders with bold ideas but limited security experience will ship applications that handle real users and real data. That’s a powerful shift. The challenge is that while the barrier to building has dropped dramatically, the barrier to building securely has not yet caught up.</p><p>The opportunity is not to slow down vibe coding but to elevate it. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wiz.io/academy/ai-security/what-is-ai-security"><u>Security</u></a> needs to become a first class, built-in part of AI powered development.

<div><p>I use TimescaleDB every day.</p><p>Being able to ask questions to an LLM copilot about patterns across several billion rows, 140GB of time series data, like how the market reacts 15 minutes, 1 day, and 1 week after Federal Reserve press releases, using time_bucket() and other aggregation functions with compressed chunks, and having the copilot generate the queries and run them fast, is going to be game changing. I can ask to write a script to scrape the press releases, to run them through another agent to classify them (hawk, dove) and use that information in the time series analysis.</p><p>Even though that exploration has not produced any actionable, tradable results for me, which is why I am sharing it, eventually TimescaleDB will be one of the most important tools in fields like medical research. A researcher will be able to ask in natural language for statistically significant patterns in the data, and LLM agents will query it quickly while taking advantage of all the TimescaleDB optimizations.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46858595"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46858595" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46858595&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46857488"></a></center></td><td><br>

We have hundreds of customers using our data products including Google, Amazon, Facebook, Intel, and Adobe, across industries including Finance, Recruiting, Sales, Marketing, and Security. We’re a fully-remote company with a global footprint in over 20 countries. We're growing, profitable, employee-owned, no dependence on outside funding. Applicants from all geographies and backgrounds are welcome.
We are looking for passionate individuals for whom programming is not just a job but it’s something they love to do. We're obsessed with computers, programming, big data, databases, compilers, hardware, math, data science, and the internet. Does this sound like you? Please apply to join our team.</p><p>Our code base is very friendly to new contributors. You'll have a fully-functional development environment within hours (fully automated) and be pushing commits on your first day. Deployments to production happen multiple times per day and finish in less than 2 minutes. Effectively all of our codebase is written in Python, Rust, SQL, Javascript/TypeScript, and Nix. The core technologies you'll need familiarity with to be productive are Python, PostgreSQL, Linux, and Git.</p><p>We operate at a larger scale than typical startups. We operate two datacenters with high performance servers we've built that are capable of dealing with the volumes of data we process. We've implemented our own distributed file system. We do full-scale web crawls. We download and perform static analysis on the entire universe of Android APKs and iOS IPAs that are published. Unlike a typical startup where you'll spend half of your time in meetings, and the other half fixing bugs from Jira tickets— at MixRank you'll get to challenge yourself with difficult technical problems that will help you to grow as an individual.</p><p>We're hiring continuously for the positions below— they aren't singular positions that will close once filled. Our philosophy on hiring is that the candidate is more important than the position. For each new member of the team, we design a custom role and responsibilities that are specialized to their interests. Other companies will come up with a long list of specific requirements for a position with the expectation that you'll exactly replace someone from the team, or that you'll be the perfect tetris piece that satisfies the job requirements decided by a committee. MixRank is more pragmatic: we'll first get excited about having a unique individual on the team, then we'll figure out the best way to accommodate their specific talents.</p><p>-- Junior Software Engineer - Remote (Global), Full-Time</p><p>We're looking for remote junior engineers that have 0-3 years of professional experience in software, and 5+ years of curiosity exploring computers, programming, and technical hobby projects. This is an open-ended entry role with mentorship and diverse opportunities to work on all areas of our product: databases, distributed systems, infrastructure and tooling, data analysis, machine learning, frontend/backend web development, APIs, data mining, data modeling, and more. To stand out, please highlight what makes you unique: passion for computing, curiosity and side projects, work ethic, niche research, etc.</p><p>Ideally you've already graduated, but if you still have one or more years left of school, please feel free to apply anyway, and if you're the right fit for the team we'll figure out a way to accommodate your schedule. <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/mixrank/jobs/Fnwsojk-j">https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/mixrank/jobs/Fnwsojk-j</a>... --</p><p>Software Engineer - Remote (Global), Full-Time</p><p>We're hiring generalist software engineers to work on web applications, data mining, machine learning/data science, data transformation/ETL, data modeling, database scaling, infrastructure, devops, and more.

I'm a backend/platform engineer and developer advocate with over 10 years of experience building systems at scale across startups and growth-stage companies like Uber and DoorDash.</p><p>Until earlier this year, I worked at Uber as a Developer Advocate for Cadence — an open-source workflow orchestration engine powering 12B+ workflows/month. I partnered with dozens of teams to support adoption, scale distributed systems, and troubleshoot production issues. Cadence is a key component of Uber's Michelangelo ML platform, and I worked closely with AI/ML teams to integrate it into fault-tolerant pipelines. I also supported internal model training efforts, including fine-tuning LLMs to answer Cadence-related questions and building systems to classify and prioritize developer support.</p><p>At DoorDash, I contributed to the migration from Django to Kotlin microservices on the Drive Merchant Services team, focusing on customer support endpoints. I also designed and implemented a modular refund rules engine for our largest partners, enabling flexible refund logic and supporting internal tooling.</p><p>I’ve previously built NLP pipelines at Jobscan to match résumés to job descriptions and score resume strength, and earlier, trained models to predict ad performance based on copywriting—my first foray into ML back in 2016.</p><p>After wrapping up at Uber, I'm now excited to return to a hands-on engineering role with a collaborative, technically strong team and a path toward engineering leadership (EM or CTO). I'm particularly interested in infrastructure, developer platforms, and applied ML systems in domains like healthcare, logistics, finance, or defense.</p><p>Outside of work, I enjoy navigating Puget Sound on my sailboat, wrenching on my motorcycle, and getting curious about obscure systems and trivia. Let’s build something meaningful.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46863578"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46863578" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46863578&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46857487"></a></center></td><td><br>

I am open to other engineering roles, but I am mainly looking for engineering roles (or hybrid science/engineer roles) that focus on supporting scientists or scientific organizations.  For the last ten years, I have bounced between working as researcher and engineer, and I have a track record of helping scientists write better code (and build better machine learning models).  Most recently, I have been part of a team working on a GenAI system.  My focus has been on (1) testing to guarantee the model continues to support critical customer needs, and (2) systems that override the model output to increase reliability and consistency for the end users.</p><p>I love helping scientists automate the repetitive parts of their work while allowing the flexibility necessary for experimentation.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46863241"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46863241" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46863241&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46857487"></a></center></td><td><br>

In my most recent internship at JetBrains, I worked on the backend for remote Kotlin code compilation. Prior to that, I worked at Dell on the MLOps team, where I gained exposure to DevOps and some cloud technologies.</p><p>You can check out my resume and GitHub (link included in the resume) for a complete overview of my experience and side projects.</p><p>Most of my coding experience is in Java and Python. I also really enjoy Kotlin and I am currently learning Go (Golang) by building a simple VPN as a side project. I prefer working with strongly typed languages. For example, I don’t have much experience with Rust or C++ but I’m eager to learn.</p><p>Feel free to reach out to me via email or connect with me on LinkedIn.

I'm a Software Engineer of ~9 years with a focus on Front-End Development, but moving towards Full-Stack in my day-to-day work. I’m passionate about delivering quality user experiences both on the UI and API level. I’m interested in fine tuning performance, and making sure that the development experience is just as great in my teams, as the user’s. My main interests are healthcare products, and developer tooling / any tools that could be used during the development process. (Ex.: Task boards, CI, Design tools, and many more!). Open hearing any offers though. I have experience working with teams from early stage startups through companies collaborating between time zones, with large engineering teams. Send me a message if you think I could be a good addition to your team!</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46862957"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46862957" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46862957&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46857487"></a></center></td><td><br>

Doing a working holiday in Japan, Osaka starting April 2026. I love building stuff, especially when it has to do with AI (mostly LLMs). I have tons of ideas, so in my freetime I turned many of them into open-source projects (see GitHub). At work I'm working with Java / Spring Boot and k8s - 50/50 split between Dev and OPS. I would be particularly interested in positions that have something to do with AI native software development/applications. The field is rapidly changing and I think there's a lot to explore.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46858008"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46858008" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46858008&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46857487"></a></center></td><td><br>

Full-stack Engineer with 2+ years of experience. I specialize in building complex, data-heavy frontend systems and automating the "un-automatable."</p><p>Engineering Highlights:</p><p>• Built a WCAG-compliant accessibility engine: Developed a full-stack scanning platform from scratch (Node.js/Vue). Solved the challenge of real-time DOM auditing and automated remediation via an embeddable widget. Currently in beta with enterprise clients.</p><p>• Architected high-performance scraping infrastructure: Engineered a scalable data-processing service using Puppeteer and MongoDB. Optimized it to handle 1,000+ complex records efficiently, bypassing dynamic rendering hurdles.</p><p>• SEO &amp; Performance Engineering: Led the technical SEO and content strategy for a platform reaching 2M+ organic visitors. Focused on Core Web Vitals, SSR optimization (Next.js), and semantic HTML to drive growth.</p><p>• Product Ownership: I don't just close tickets; I actively shape the roadmap. I've spent the last year translating business requirements from stakeholder meetings into stable, production-ready features.</p><p>Currently seeking roles in Tokyo or remote-first companies. I value TypeScript-heavy codebases, Agile workflows, and teams that treat frontend as a serious engineering discipline.</p><p>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/ramazandogna" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/ramazandogna</a></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46861258"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46861258" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46861258&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46857487"></a></center></td><td><br>

I've programmed in many languages and environments over the years. Some of my current interests are:</p><p>• Developer experience. I love helping my fellow developers solve problems, and building tools to make their jobs easier and more enjoyable.</p><p>• Aviation and geographic data. For example, airspace and obstacle data importers for Wing; election results and voter information maps for Google; many interactive maps for other companies.</p><p>• Hardware interfacing. In a way, I am a "full stack" developer, but my stack may involve a front end to a piece of hardware rather than the cloud. I first got into programming via ham radio, so RF hardware remains an interest.</p><p>• Designing and building APIs. Too often an API is designed by exposing the internals of whatever system provides the API. My philosophy is the opposite: start with the apps. I like to build a series of sample apps before starting on the API. This way I can imagine what API will make those apps and others like them easy to build.</p><p>• Talk with users! I don't like to sit in a back room cranking out code. I want to make sure it's the right code for what my users need, and that it's easy to maintain and improve as we learn more about what they want.</p><p>Open to full time or contract.</p><p>I look forward to talking with you!</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46859298"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46859298" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46859298&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46857487"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>SEEKING WORK | Data Scientist / Consultant | US/Remote Worldwide | Email in profile</p><pre><code>   I'm a data scientist with over 20 years of experience specializing in consulting and fractional leadership. I thrive on gnarly, avant-garde problems where standard off-the-shelf solutions fall short. My track record includes saving a German automaker from lemon law recalls and helping a major cloud vendor predict server failures to enable load shedding.

   I've tackled a wide range of challenges across various industries, including oil reservoir and well engineering forecasting, automotive part failure prediction, and shipping piracy risk prediction to route ships away from danger. My technical work extends to realtime routing (CVRP-PD-TW) for on-demand delivery, legal entity and contract term extraction, and wound identification with tissue classification. I also work with the current wave of LLMs and agents, with a specific interest in applying them to effective executive functioning.

   I've worked with the standard stacks you’d expect: Python, PyTorch, Spark/Ray, AWS, Postgres, etc. But I believe the solution must be driven by the problem, not the tools. I bring years of experience helping companies plan, prototype, and productionize sane data science solutions.

<div><p>I've been making computers obey for close to four decades, and after a stint as developing CTO/'Founder' in a startup-like environment I'm on the lookout for something new. With me you'll get risk-averse compliant systems and product development with a taste for elegance tempered by both business know-how and experience with public sector organisations.</p><p>I'm at my strongest on the backend but have no fear of interfaces. Data wrangling and message passing comes easy for me, and if you want me to I'll learn both new programming languages and complex regulations needed to judge what we can and can't do.</p><p>A lot of my work experience has been spent on so called legacy code, so that's something I'm good at. Perhaps there are 2 MLOC ticking away on a server that no one has touched in years, perhaps you just bought a competing product and want to chop out the good parts, I'll sit down and fix it and show up on your screen every now and then and tell you how it goes and what it would require to do it faster. You'll also get diagrams and show-and-tells aimed at people with background in non-technical professions, and documentation that smooths the on-boarding of juniors.</p><p>English is fine, born into swedish, if you pay me while I do it I'll dust off my german or spanish and aim for fluency within a year. At work I'm not as grumpy as I might be when posting off here, I'm actually pretty easy-going and quite solution oriented, as it is required when doing the kind of work for lawyers, the government and profitable B2B customers that I have.</p><p>If you have financing and would like to build a business doing software due diligence, e.g. towards investors, creditors, bankruptcy lawyers or whatever, then I'd really, really like to come into contact with you. That's what I've been doing the past few years but didn't have the organisation to bring to stable profitability.</p><pre><code>  Location: Sweden

<div><p>I am fascinated by the prevalence of wanting "tests" from hacker news comments. Most of the code I have worked on in the past 20 years did not have tests.

So I write up some dummy data of a user and a lead and pass it through the code, but it feels of limited value, almost like just additional ceremony. Most of the bugs I see are from a misconception of different users about what a flag means. I can not think of a time a test caught something.</p><p>The organization is huge and people do not go and run all the code every time some other area of the system is changed. Maybe they should? But I doubt that would ever happen given the politics of the organization.</p><p>So I am curious, what are the kinds of tests do people write in other areas of the industry?</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46858598"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="2"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="80"></td><td><center><a id="up_46858598" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46858598&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46857444"></a></center></td><td><br>

Roughly this would be typical:</p><p>- comprehensive requirements on the software behavior, with tests to verify those requirements. Tests are automated as much as possible (e.g., scripts rather than manual testing)</p><p>- tests are generally run first in a test suite in a completely virtual software environment</p><p>- structural coverage analysis (depending on level of criticality) to show that all code in the subsystem was executed by the testing (or adequately explain why the testing can't hit that code)</p><p>- then once that passes, run the same tests in a hardware lab environment, testing the software as it runs on the the actual physical component that will be installed on the plane</p><p>- then test that actually on a plane, through a series of flight tests. (The flight testing would likely not be as entirely comprehensive as the previous steps)</p><p>A full round of testing is very time-consuming and expensive, and as much as possible should be caught and fixed in the virtual software tests before it even gets to the hardware lab, much less to the plane.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46859728"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="2"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="80"></td><td><center><a id="up_46859728" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46859728&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46857444"></a></center></td><td><br>
<div><p>How do you know you haven't unknowingly broken something when you made a change?</p><p>I think if:
- the code base implements many code paths depending on options and user inputs and options such that a fix for code path A may break code path B
- it takes a great deal of time to run in production such that issues may only be caught weeks or months down the line when it becomes difficult to pinpoint their cause (not all software is real-time or web)
- any given developer does not have it all in their head such that they can anticipate issues codebase wide</p><p>then it becomes useful to have (automated) testing that checks a change in function A didn't break functionality in function B that relies on A in some way(s), that are just thorough enough that they catch edge cases, but don't take prod levels of resources to run.</p><p>Now I agree some things might not need testing beyond implementation. Things that don't depend on other program behavior, or that check their inputs thoroughly, and are never touched again once merged, don't really justify keeping unit tests around. But I'm not sure these are ever guarantees (especially the never touched again).</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46858485"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="2"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="80"></td><td><center><a id="up_46858485" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46858485&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46857444"></a></center></td><td><br>
<div><p>The value of tests is when the fail they show you of something you broke that you didn't realize.  80% (likely more, but I don't know how to measure) of the tests I write could safely be thrown away because they fail again - but I don't know which tests will fail and thus inform me that I broke things.</p><p>The system I'm working on has been in production for 12 years - we have added a lot of new features over those years. Many of those needed us to hook into existing code, tests help us know that we didn't break something that used to work.</p><p>Maybe that helps answer the question of why they are important to me.

<div><p>I think the whole concept of testing confuses a lot of people. I know I was (and still sometimes am) confused about the various "best practices" and opinions around testing. As as well as how/what/when to test.</p><p>For my projects, I mainly want to Get Shit Done. So I write tests for the major functional areas of the business logic, mainly because I want to know ASAP when I accidentally break something important. When a bug is found that a test didn't catch, that's usually an indicator that I forgot a test, or need to beef up that area of functional testing.</p><p>I do not bother with TDD, or tests that would only catch cosmetic issues, and I avoid writing tests that only actually test some major dependency (like an ORM).</p><p>If the organization you are in does not value testing, you are probably not going to change their mind. But if you have the freedom to write worthwhile tests for your contributions to the code, doing so will probably make you a better developer.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46860389"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="3"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="120"></td><td><center><a id="up_46860389" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46860389&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46857444"></a></center></td><td><br>
