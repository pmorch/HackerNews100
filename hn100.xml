	<div>
		<p>A reader at respected airline industry site <i>Leeham News</i> offered <a href="https://leehamnews.com/2024/01/15/unplanned-removal-installation-inspection-procedure-at-boeing/#comment-509962" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a comment</a> that suggests they have access to Boeing’s internal quality control systems, and shares details of what they saw regarding the Boeing 737 MAX 9 flown by Alaska Airlines that had a door plug detach inflight, causing rapid decompression of the aircraft.
</p><p>The takeaway appears to be that outsourced plane components have so many problems when they show up at the production line that Boeing’s quality control staff can’t keep up with them all.</p>
<blockquote><p>Current Boeing employee here – I will save you waiting two years for the NTSB report to come out and give it to you for free: the reason the door blew off is stated in black and white in Boeings own records. It is also very, very stupid and speaks volumes about the quality culture at certain portions of the business.</p>
<p>…With that out of the way… why did the left hand (LH) mid-exit door plug blow off of the 737-9 registered as N704AL? Simple- as has been covered in a number of articles and videos across aviation channels, there are 4 bolts that prevent the mid-exit door plug from sliding up off of the door stop fittings that take the actual pressurization loads in flight, and these 4 bolts were not installed when Boeing delivered the airplane, our own records reflect this.</p>
<p>…As a result, this check job that should find minimal defects has in the past 365 calendar days recorded 392 nonconforming findings on 737 mid fuselage door installations (so both actual doors for the high density configs, and plugs like the one that blew out). That is a hideously high and very alarming number, and if our quality system on 737 was healthy, it would have stopped the line and driven the issue back to supplier after the first few instances. </p>
<p>…Now, on the incident aircraft this check job was completed on 31 August 2023, and did turn up discrepancies, but on the RH side door, not the LH that actually failed. I could blame the team for missing certain details, but given the enormous volume of defects they were already finding and fixing, it was inevitable something would slip through- and on the incident aircraft something did. I know what you are thinking at this point, but grab some popcorn because there is a plot twist coming up.</p>
<p>The next day on 1 September 2023 a different team (remember 737s flow through the factory quite quickly, 24 hours completely changes who is working on the plane) wrote up a finding for damaged and improperly installed rivets on the LH mid-exit door of the incident aircraft.</p>
<p>…Because there are so many problems with the Spirit build in the 737, Spirit has teams on site in Renton performing warranty work for all of their shoddy quality, and this SAT promptly gets shunted into their queue as a warranty item. Lots of bickering ensues in the SAT messages, and it takes a bit for Spirit to get to the work package. Once they have finished, they send it back to a Boeing QA for final acceptance, but then Malicious Stupid Happens! The Boeing QA writes another record in CMES (again, the correct venue) stating (with pictures) that Spirit has not actually reworked the discrepant rivets, they *just painted over the defects*. In Boeing production speak, this is a “process failure”. For an A&amp;P mechanic at an airline, this would be called “federal crime”.</p>
<p>…finally we get to the damning entry which reads something along the lines of “coordinating with the doors team to determine if the door will have to be removed entirely, or just opened. If it is removed then a Removal will have to be written.” Note: a Removal is a type of record in CMES that requires formal sign off from QA that the airplane been restored to drawing requirements.</p>
<p>If you have been paying attention to this situation closely, you may be able to spot the critical error: regardless of whether the door is simply opened or removed entirely, the 4 retaining bolts that keep it from sliding off of the door stops have to be pulled out. A removal should be written in either case for QA to verify install, but as it turns out, someone (exactly who will be a fun question for investigators) decides that the door only needs to be opened, and no formal Removal is generated in CMES (the reason for which is unclear, and a major process failure). Therefore, in the official build records of the airplane, a pressure seal that cannot be accessed without opening the door (and thereby removing retaining bolts) is documented as being replaced, but the door is never officially opened and thus no QA inspection is required.</p></blockquote>	<!-- /1019006/BoardingArea_DynamicContent -->
	
	
<p>The commenter concludes, “Where are the bolts? Probably sitting forgotten and unlabeled (because there is no formal record number to label them with) on a work-in-progress bench, unless someone already tossed them in the scrap bin to tidy up.”</p>
<p>The information was first flagged by aviation watchdog <b>JonNYC</b>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">..unvetted (every other synonym for that as well,) commenter here:<a href="https://t.co/R3KdqDHION">https://t.co/R3KdqDHION</a></p>
<p>And now I'm seeing a couple other usually credible, usually careful folks positing same idea.</p>
<p>As always– more so than usual– no idea myself.</p>
<p>—  JonNYC  (@xJonNYC) <a href="https://twitter.com/xJonNYC/status/1749461063446241544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 22, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Boeing <a href="https://viewfromthewing.com/boeings-response-to-737-max-crisis-more-inspections-team-reviews-but-is-it-enough/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outsources a lot of the production of components for its aircraft because it’s cheaper</a> as part of an overall shift in strategy that dates to CEO Harry Stonecipher who had been CEO of McDonnell Douglas,</p>
<blockquote><p>When people say I changed the culture of Boeing, that was the intent, so that it’s run like a business rather than a great engineering firm.</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the major suppliers is Spirit AeroSystems, which used to be <i>part of Boeing</i> and was spun out and sold to private equity in 2005.  That’s whose work is at issue here.</p>
<p>This story suggests a one-off mistake with this particular part on this particular aircraft, though also that production issues are common.  That doesn’t square with a theory that <a href="https://viewfromthewing.com/is-there-a-design-flaw-in-the-boeing-737-max-9/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bolts could have come loose from flying a poorly-designed aircraft</a>, or that Boeing 737-900ERs <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68052160" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are being inspected too</a>.  Those have the same door plug because the MAX 9 is built on the same airframe.  It may or may not square with finding loose door plugs on other Boeing 737 MAX 9s.</p>
<p>So this story is far from ‘official’ but it seems knowledgeable from someone who suggests they’re a whistleblower inside of Boeing.   A story in <i>Politico</i> this morning suggests that <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/01/22/boeing-lobbying-congress-faa-00136704#:~:text=Boeing%20is%20still%20a%20sprawling,Patton%20Boggs%20and%20Crossroads%20Strategies." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boeing’s new team of lobbyists has their work cut out for them</a>.  It certainly appears so, but perhaps work needs to start at the board and C-suite level.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I was at <a href="https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/">cfgmgmtcamp 2019</a> in Ghent, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBm3oyUmoAo&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=18586">did a talk</a> which I think was well received about the need for some Kubernetes configuration management as well as the solution we built for it at $work, <a href="https://kr8.rocks/">kr8</a>.</p>
<p>I made a statement during the talk which ignited some fairly fierce discussion both online, and at the conference:</p>
<blockquote data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">"If you're starting to template yaml, ask yourself the question: why am I not *generating* json?" - <a href="https://twitter.com/briggsl?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@briggsl</a> spitting straight fire at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/cfgmgmtcamp?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#cfgmgmtcamp</a></p>— 🌈eric sorenson 🌊 (@ahpook) <a href="https://twitter.com/ahpook/status/1092810831216197643?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 5, 2019</a></blockquote>

<p>To put this into my own words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At some point, we decided it was okay for us to template yaml. When did this happen? How is this acceptable?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After some conversation, I figured it was probably best to back up my claims in some way. This blog post is going to try to do that.</p>
<h2 id="the-configuration-problem">The configuration problem</h2>
<p>Once the applications and infrastructure you’re going to manage grows past a certain size, you inevitably end up in some form of configuration complexity hell. If you’re only deploying 1 or maybe 2 things, you can write a yaml configuration file and be done with it. However once you grow beyond that, you need to figure out how to manage this complexity. It’s incredibly likely that the reason you have multiple configuration files is because the $thing that uses that config is slightly different from its companions. Examples of this include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Applications deployed in different environments, like dev, stg and prod
</li><li>Applications deployed in different regions, like Europe or North American
</li></ul>
<p>Obviously, not <em>all</em> the configuration is different here, but it’s likely the configuration differs enough that you want to be able to differentiate between the two.</p>
<p>This configuration complexity has been well known for Operators (System Administrators, DevOps engineers, whatever you want to call them) for some years now. An entire discpline grew up around this in Configuration Management, and each tool solved this problem in their own way, but ultimately, they used YAML to get the job done.</p>
<p>My favourite method has always been <a href="https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/6.2/hiera_intro.html">hiera</a> which comes bundled with Puppet. Having the ability to hierarchically look up the variables of specific config needs is incredibly powerful and flexible, and has generally meant you don’t actually need to do any templating of yaml at all, except perhaps for embedding Puppet facts into the yaml.</p>
<h2 id="did-we-go-backwards">Did we go backwards?</h2>
<p>Then, as our industries’ needs moved above the operating system and into cloud computing, we had a whole new data plane to configure. The tooling to configure this changed, and tools like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">CloudFormation</a> and <a href="https://helm.sh/">Helm</a> appeared. These tools are excellent configuration tools, but I firmly believe we (as an industry) got something really, really wrong when we designed them. To examine that, let’s take a look at example of a helm chart taking a custom parameter</p>
<h3 id="helm-charts">Helm Charts</h3>
<p>Helm charts can take external parameters defined by an <code>values.yaml</code> file which you specify when rendering the chart. A simple example might look like this:</p>
<p>Let’s say my external parameter is simple - it’s a string. It’d look a bit like this:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>image</span><span>:</span> <span>"{{ .Values.image }}"</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>That’s not so bad right? You just specify a value for <code>image</code> in your values.yaml and you’re on your way.</p>
<p>The real problem starts to get highlighted when you want to do more complicated and complex things. In this particular example, you’re doing okay because you <em>know</em> you have to specify an image for a Kubernetes deployment. However, what if you’re working with something like an optional field? Well, then it gets a little more unwieldy:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>{{</span><span>-</span> <span>with</span> <span>.</span><span>resourceGroup</span>  <span>}}</span>
    <span>resourceGroup</span><span>:</span> <span>{{</span> <span>.</span>  <span>}}</span>
<span>{{</span><span>-</span> <span>end</span> <span>}}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Optional values just make things ugly in templating languages, and you can’t just leave the value blank, so you have to resort to ugly loops and conditionals that are probably going to bite you later.</p>
<p>Let’s say you need to go a step further, and you need to push an array or map into the config. With helm, you’d do something like this.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>{{</span><span>-</span> <span>with</span> <span>.</span><span>Values</span><span>.</span><span>podAnnotations</span>  <span>}}</span>
      <span>annotations</span><span>:</span>
<span>{{</span> <span>toYaml</span> <span>.</span> <span>|</span> <span>indent</span> <span>8</span>  <span>}}</span>
<span>{{</span><span>-</span> <span>end</span>  <span>}}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Firstly, let’s ignore the madness of having a templating function <code>toYaml</code> to convert yaml to yaml and focus more on the whitespace issue here.</p>
<p>YAML has strict requirements and whitespace implementation rules. The following, for example, is not valid or complete yaml:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>something</span><span>:</span> <span>nothing</span>
  <span>hello</span><span>:</span> <span>goodbye</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Generally, if you’re handwriting something, this isn’t necessarily a problem because you just hit backspace twice and it’s fixed. However, if you’re generating YAML using a templating system, you can’t do that - and if you’re operating above 5 or 10 configuration files, you probably want to be <em>generating</em> your config rather than writing it.</p>
<p>So, in the above example, you want to embed the values of <code>.Values.podAnnotations</code> under the annotations field, which is indented already. So you’re having to not only indent your values, but indent them correctly.</p>
<p>What makes this <em>even more confusing</em> is that the go parser doesn’t actually know anything about YAML at all, so if you try to keep the syntax clean and indent the templates like this:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>{{</span><span>-</span> <span>with</span> <span>.</span><span>Values</span><span>.</span><span>podAnnotations</span> <span>}}</span>
      <span>annotations</span><span>:</span>
      <span>{{</span> <span>toYaml</span> <span>.</span> <span>|</span> <span>indent</span> <span>6</span> <span>}}</span>
<span>{{</span><span>-</span> <span>end</span>  <span>}}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>You actually can’t do that, because the templating system gets confused. This is a singular example of the complexity and difficulty you end up facing when generating config data in YAML, but when you really start to do more complex work, it really starts to become obvious that this isn’t the way to go.</p>
<p>Needless to say, this isn’t what I want to spend <em>my</em> time doing. If fiddling around with whitespace requirements in a templating system doing something it’s not really designed for is what suits you, then I’m not going to stop you. I also don’t want to spend my time writing configuration in JSON without comments and accidentally missing commas all over the shop. We (as an industry) decided a long time ago that shit wasn’t going to work and that’s why YAML exists.</p>
<p>So what should we do instead? That’s where <a href="https://jsonnet.org/">jsonnet</a> comes in.</p>
<h2 id="json-jsonnet--yaml">JSON, Jsonnet &amp; YAML</h2>
<p>Before we actually talk about Jsonnet, it’s worth reminding people of a very important (but oft forgotten point). <a href="https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2759572">YAML is a superset of JSON</a> and converting between the two is trivial. Many applications and programming languages will parse JSON and YAML natively, and many can convert between the two very simple. For example, in Python:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>python</span> <span>-</span><span>c</span> <span>'import json, sys, yaml ; y=yaml.safe_load(sys.stdin.read()) ; print(json.dumps(y))'</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>So with that in mind, let’s talk about Jsonnet.</p>
<h3 id="welcome-to-the-church-of-jsonnet">Welcome to the church of Jsonnet</h3>
<p>Jsonnet is a relatively new, little known (outside the Kubernetes community?) language that calls itself a <em>data templating language</em>. It’s definitely a good exercise to read and consume the Jsonnet <a href="https://jsonnet.org/articles/design.html">design rationale</a> page to get an idea why it exists, but if I was going to define in a nutshell what its purpose is - it’s to generate JSON config.</p>
<p>So, how does it help, exactly?</p>
<p>Well, let’s take our earlier example - we want to generate some JSON config specifying a parameter (ie, the image string). We can do that very very easily with Jsonnet using external variables.</p>
<p>Firstly, let’s define some Jsonnet:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>{</span>

  <span>image</span><span>:</span> <span>std</span><span>.</span><span>extVar</span><span>(</span><span>'image'</span><span>),</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Then, we can generate it using the Jsonnet command line tool, passing in the external variable as we need to:</p>
<div><pre><code>jsonnet image.jsonnet <span>-V</span> <span>image</span><span>=</span><span>"my-image"</span>
<span>{</span>
   <span>"image"</span>: <span>"my-image"</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Easy!</p>
<h3 id="optional-fields">Optional fields</h3>
<p>Before, I noted that if you wanted to define an optional field, with YAML templating you had to define if statements for everything. With Jsonnet, you’re just defining code!</p>
<div><pre><code><span>// define a variable - yes, jsonnet also has comments</span>
<span>local</span> <span>rg</span> <span>=</span> <span>null</span><span>;</span>
<span>{</span>


  <span>image</span><span>:</span> <span>std</span><span>.</span><span>extVar</span><span>(</span><span>'image'</span><span>),</span>
  <span>// if the variable is null, this will be blank</span>
  <span>[</span><span>if</span> <span>rg</span> <span>!</span><span>=</span> <span>null</span> <span>then</span> <span>'resourceGroup'</span><span>]:</span> <span>rg</span><span>,</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The output here, because our variable is null, means that we never actually populate resourceGroup. If you specify a value, it will appear:</p>
<div><pre><code>jsonnet image.jsonnet <span>-V</span> <span>image</span><span>=</span><span>"my-image"</span> 
<span>{</span>
   <span>"image"</span>: <span>"my-image"</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="maps-and-parameters">Maps and parameters</h3>
<p>Okay, now let’s look at our previous annotation example. We want to define some pod annotations, which takes a YAML map as its input. You want this map to be configurable by specifying external data, and obviously doing that on the command line sucks (you’d be very unlikely to specify this with Helm on the command line, for example) so generally you’d use Jsonnet imports to this. I’m going to specify this config as a variable and then load that variable into the annotation:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>local</span> <span>annotations</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>'nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/app-root'</span><span>:</span> <span>'/'</span><span>,</span>
  <span>'nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/enable-cors'</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>{</span>
  <span>metadata</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span> <span>// annotations are nested under the metadata of a pod</span>
    <span>annotations</span><span>:</span> <span>annotations</span><span>,</span>
  <span>},</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This might just be my bias towards Jsonnet talking, but this is so dramatically easier than faffing about with indentation that I can’t even begin to describe it.</p>
<h3 id="additional-goodies">Additional goodies</h3>
<p>The final thing I wanted to quickly explore, which is something that I feel can’t really be done with Helm and other yaml templating tools, is the concept of manipulating existing objects in config.</p>
<p>Let’s take our example above with the annotations, and look at the result file:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
   </span><span>"metadata"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
      </span><span>"annotations"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
         </span><span>"nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/app-root"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"/"</span><span>,</span><span>
         </span><span>"nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/enable-cors"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>
      </span><span>}</span><span>
   </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now, let’s say for example I wanted to append a set of annotations to this annotations map. In any templating system, I’d probably have to rewrite the whole map.</p>
<p>Jsonnet makes this <em>trivial</em>. I can simply use the <code>+</code> operator to add something to this. Here’s a (poor) example:</p>

<p><span>Bialetti, the Italian maker of </span>the moka pot, a stovetop coffee machine and one of the most iconic kitchen appliances ever created, announced in 2018 that <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/10/28/trouble-brewing-classic-italian-moka-pot-coffee-pods-dominate/">the company was in major trouble</a>—tens of millions of Euros in debt, unpaid salaries and taxes, revenues that are way down and look to be staying that way. In a press release, the company said there are “doubts over its continuity.” (Update: <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/04/24/bialetti-moka-pot-italian-icon-coffee-espresso-comeback/">Bialetti sales have been on the rise</a> since then.)</p>
<p>The moka pot is a symbol of Italy: of postwar ingenuity and global culinary dominance. It is in the Museum of Modern Art, the Cooper-Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum, and other temples to design. It is in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world’s most popular coffee maker, and was for decades commonplace to the point of ubiquity not only in Italy but in Cuba, Argentina, Australia, and the United States. It’s also widely misunderstood and maligned, with approval in the modern coffee world coming perhaps a bit too late, in only the past few years. Get one while you can.</p>
<hr>
<p><span>Italy’s place in the history </span>of global coffee culture is substantial, but for different reasons and in different ways than most people probably think. The various species of <em>Coffea</em>, the seeds of which are dried, roasted, and ground to make coffee, are native to east Africa, particularly Ethiopia. Coffee as a beverage first shows up in the historical record—which is not necessarily to say that it wasn’t consumed in its native Ethiopia first—in what is now Yemen. It spread quickly throughout the Middle East, North Africa, and firmly established itself as part of the culture in what are now Turkey and Iran.</p>
<p>Europeans were late to the coffee party, but Italy, sharing the Mediterranean with the Arab and Greek worlds and not really very far from North Africa, was probably the gateway for coffee to spread westward. But for centuries after its introduction to Venice in the early 17th century, coffee was seen as an Arab affectation, something foreign and alternately exotic and threatening. “It was thought of as an Eastern thing, in that Orientalist way of thinking,” says Peter Giuliano, the chief research officer for the Specialty Coffee Association and a former co-owner of the influential Counter Culture coffee company.</p>

<p>Until the late 19th century, Italians drank coffee in pretty much the same way as the Turks. Coffee and water are combined in a long-handled metal pot called a <em>cezve</em> and held over a heat source; the mixture combines as it boils, and is poured into small cups, where the grounds settle to the bottom. Italy never really left behind the idea of small amounts of very strong coffee. The thinner, lighter, larger mugfuls of coffee were more a northern European, and North American, thing.</p>
<p>Italians began coming up with their own gadgets for brewing coffee in the 19th century, but the biggest by far was the idea of applying pressure to coffee in order to create a strong, and more importantly fast, drink. This is the age of steam, a miraculous source of power that can unlock the world, and though it’s not entirely clear who originated the idea of using steam to brew coffee, certainly it was in Italy that it was popularized. The first known patent for a machine we might now recognize as an espresso machine was registered by Angelo Moriondo, who created a giant complicated steam-driven machine in 1884, but who never bothered to manufacture it. Luigi Bezzera, from Milan, modified the Moriondo patent, and <em>his</em> design was further modified (though less so than Bezzera’s) by Desidiero Pavoni, whose La Pavoni introduced the world to espresso in 1906, at a world’s fair held in Milan.</p>

<p>Pavoni’s device was a large complex metal contraption that worked, roughly, like this. A compartment of water on the bottom of the device is heated by placing the entire thing on a flame. A tube leads up to a circular puck of ground coffee; because the entire device is sealed, as the water boils, pressure forces steam and hot water up through the tube and through the coffee grounds. That pressure brews coffee much more quickly than without the pressure, and the fast-brewed, strong coffee flows into a chamber, to be poured into cups.</p>
<p>This is, not coincidentally, the exact same way the moka pot works, though on a much smaller scale.</p>
<p>Pavoni’s device was a huge hit, but it was incredibly expensive and cumbersome. It wasn’t at all suitable for use at home, which was fine for a few decades because coffee had never been a beverage consumed at home anyway. It was, as in the Arab world, a communal activity. (As a side note, the fact that it was a communal and foreign-seeming ritual seems to have scared those in power in the Catholic world quite a bit at first; it took an official approval from Pope Clement VIII in 1600 to clear coffee’s dangerous connotations.) Coffee was too expensive, and the newly popular Pavoni brewing devices unsuited, to be making coffee at home.</p>
<p>Jeffrey T. Schnapp outlines the history of the moka pot in a 2001 paper called <em>The Romance of Caffeine and Aluminum</em>. In 1918, he writes, a Piedmontese metalworker named Alfonso Bialetti returned home after a decade spent working with aluminum in France. Industrial production of aluminum was new, then; methods for working with it at any real scale had only been developed in 1886. He opened a shop, crafting strong, lightweight aluminum versions of pots and pans that had previously been only available in iron.</p>
<p>Legend has it that the idea for the moka pot came from a laundry boiler, though that’s not confirmed. What is known is that the La Pavoni device was very trendy, and there was also a precedent for a smaller coffee machine: the <em>napoletana</em>. The <em>napoletana</em> is a small metal device with three sections: a chamber of water, a small puck of coffee in the middle, and a chamber on the other end for brewed coffee. Water is heated up with the water chamber on the bottom, and then the entire device is flipped upside-down, allowing the hot water to drip through the coffee beans and gather as coffee in the previously empty chamber. No pressure is involved.</p>

<p>Bialetti worked on some combination of the La Pavoni and the <em>napoletana </em>for a few years and in 1933 patented his Bialetti Moka Express. It’s three-chambered, like the <em>napoletana</em>, but uses steam power to force hot water through the coffee, like the La Pavoni. The characteristic hourglass shape, with the eight-sided chambers, was there from the beginning.</p>
<p>But the Moka Express design—today, “Bialetti Moka Express” is the specific product, while “moka pot” is the general term for this type of coffee maker—took a while to catch on. Italy still had to get embroiled in a couple of World Wars, and then recover.* By the 1950s, Italian design had some amazing advantages. All of the factories set up to create war materials were at a loss for products to make, as were a generation of skilled manufacturers. Vespa, Fiat, and Alfa Romeo designed incredible vehicles. And Bialetti’s Moka Express, which still boasted a futuristic and clever design, suddenly took off.</p>

<p>Post-war Italy had a surging economy, a growing middle class, and the same access to the world’s products that the rest of Europe boasted. Alfonso Bialetti’s son, Renato, came back to Piedmont in 1946 to take over his father’s shop, and decided to stop making everything except one product: the Moka Express. The newly low price of aluminum and coffee, and a growing middle class of people who could buy products like this, made the moka pot a perfect device for the time. Renato was also a pretty shrewd businessman; in 1953, he commissioned the drawing of the company’s logo, <em>L’omino con i baffi</em>, “the little man with the mustache,” which has since been inseparable from the Moka Express. The Moka Express was “the first way that Italians could realistically make coffee at home that was some approximation of what they could get outside,” says Giuliano.</p>
<p>Over the next 60 years, the moka pot would conquer the world. As of 2016, the <em>New York Times</em> notes that over 90 percent of Italian homes had one. It became so iconic that Renato Bialetti, when he died in early 2016, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2016/02/18/europe/italy-bialetti-moka-urn/index.html">was actually buried</a> in a large replica of the moka pot. It spread to some countries with large Italian immigrant populations, becoming common in the Italian-American communities in and around Philadelphia, New York City, and Chicago. Argentina and Australia, both of which received large waves of Italian immigration in the 20th century, are also home to plenty of moka pots. The Argentinian company Volturno has been so successful that the moka pot in Argentina is sometimes called a Volturno.</p>

<p>Cuba is a more interesting one. Coffee has a long history in Cuba; the climate, hot and wet with plenty of elevation, is ideal for growing coffee, and the crop has been grown there since the mid-1700s. Up until the Cuban Revolution in 1959, Cuba was one of the world’s great coffee producers, and also one of the world’s great coffee cultures. Coffee preparation varied; in the cities, espresso was common, and on coffee plantations, it was more typical to grind beans in a mortar called a <em>pilón</em> and steep with hot water before straining out the grounds with cloth.</p>
<p>After the 1959 revolution, food rations came for coffee as well. Coffee is currently rationed to four ounces per person per month, coming in two packets. But these rations aren’t pure coffee; <a href="https://havanatimes.org/?p=120256">they are mixed</a> with fillers, sometimes toasted chickpeas (<em>cafe con chicharo</em>) to make the small amounts go further.</p>
<p>Because the amounts of coffee are so low, and efficiency so important, Cubans began tinkering to come up with ways to create the best possible coffee with the materials they have. Cuban coffee in a Cuban or Cuban-American home is almost always made with a moka pot; the Cuban concoction <em>cafecito</em> is made by quickly whipping the first few drops of moka pot coffee with sugar, creating a paste that both flavors the coffee and simulates a classic espresso foam. Even outside of Cuba, where the coffee is not likely to be mixed with toasted beans, Cuban coffee is typically very sweet and very strong, almost always made with a pump machine in coffee shops and a moka pot at home.</p>
<hr>
<p><span>The moka pot’s struggles began </span>in the 1990s, and came in two forms. One, I think, is very interesting, but is not as large a factor in the demise of the moka pot as some might believe. The other is very boring and very obvious and is almost certainly the big problem. The latter is that people, in Italy and elsewhere, love coffee pods. Coffee pods, especially Nespresso, are wildly popular in Italy, because they are easy. I have very little else to say about coffee pods.</p>
<p>The former problem, the more interesting one, took place within the coffee-nerd world.</p>
<p>Inspired by Italian espresso bar culture, Starbucks almost single-handedly changed the entire concept of coffee in America. And the moka pot was not part of that. The espresso machine, which uses mechanical pressure (via pumps and/or levers), was the device used to make coffee in Italian coffee shops; the moka was strictly for the home. “In the ‘90s and early ‘00s, having some sort of ‘authentic’ Italian coffee chops were part of what was exciting and interesting about coffee,” says Giuliano, who lived through this phase at Counter Culture. In the 1990s, coffee shops, which greatly informed coffee consumption in the U.S. in general, looked to Italian coffee bars.</p>

<p>This ignored that Italians never really made espresso at home. They used the moka pot. Espresso machines, then and now, are gigantic, expensive, difficult to use, and incredibly inefficient from an energy perspective. They do not really make sense for the home. But Americans tried anyway, replacing their Mr. Coffees and French presses with underpowered home espresso machines, ignoring the entire time that there was another option, the one Italians used all along.</p>
<p>After the Starbucks boom, American coffee culture changed rapidly, eventually coming to embrace drip coffee, especially a lighter, more acidic style common in Scandinavia and Japan. Espresso stayed, of course—with the glaring exception of the moka pot, Americans never really stopped looking to Italy for coffee, and even today most of the “serious” espresso machines come from Italian companies.</p>
<p>The moka pot, which in the U.S. had previously had a light following, especially for Italian-Americans, became an object of extreme derision. Coffee purists cried that it couldn’t possibly produce espresso; the moka pot, like the La Pavoni, uses about 1.5 bars of pressure, while a pump espresso machine ideally hits about nine bars. This is, of course, a ridiculous argument; there is no actual definition of espresso, and in any case, the moka pot is at most a second cousin to the espresso machine. There’s no particular reason to compare a steam-driven stovetop machine to a pump-driven electrical device, but coffee people did.</p>

<p>The past few years have changed that, a little bit. Coffee people have softened their stance, and recognized the moka pot for what it is: an entirely different branch of the coffee machine tree, a very old, very clever, and very economical way to make coffee. The previous complaints about the moka pot fell away, and it is increasingly, in coffee circles, given credit for all its strengths.</p>
<p>The nice thing about the moka pot is that it can create a very nice cup of strong coffee, and that the equipment you need is wholly affordable. Moka pots <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/unique-gifts/the-original-bialetti-moka-express">cost about 30 bucks</a>, and by using good coffee and a bit of technique, you can make as good an example of moka pot coffee as anyone in the world.</p>
<p>The rediscovery of that fact by coffee nerds bodes well for the future of the moka pot, despite the troubles of Bialetti, the company. It remains a cool, inexpensive, highly functional example of mid-century modern design. In the same way that the single-cup pour-over cone was rediscovered and prized, sparking a whole new round of sales, maybe the moka pot is due for some revitalization and new trendiness. It seems impossible, or at least undesirable, for such a cool gadget to die.</p>

        <h2>What is Oh My Zsh?</h2>
        <p>Oh My Zsh is an open source, community-driven framework for managing your Zsh configuration.</p>
        <p>Sounds boring. Let's try again.</p>
        <p>Oh My Zsh will not make you a 10x developer...but you may feel like one!</p>
        <p>Once installed, your terminal shell will become the talk of the town or your money back! With each keystroke
          in your command prompt, you'll take advantage of the hundreds of powerful plugins and beautiful themes.
          Strangers will come up to you in cafés and ask you, <em>"that is amazing! are you some sort of genius?"</em>
        </p>
        <p>Finally, you'll begin to get the sort of attention that you have always felt you deserved. ...or maybe you'll
          use the time that you're saving to start flossing more often. 😬</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>At the end of September, I returned to— more peaceful parts of Ukraine, let’s say. And a Reddit discussion inspired me to start writing what I expected to be a short blog post.</p><p>The discussion was about new Ruby syntax elements from recent versions, and, as usual, a fair share of participants expressed some variety of displeasure. I don’t care much for “I like it”/”I don’t like it” kind of discussion, yet I frequently find myself hooked by “I don’t see any explanation why this might be a good idea” or “This is absolutely against everything I love in Ruby.”</p><p>While this kind of statement can be—and frequently is—just another way to say “I don’t like it,” my mind perceives it as a challenge: can the reasoning behind the change be understood and explained? What was the design space for solving the problem?</p><p>That’s how the “Useless Ruby sugar” was born: as an attempt to look for a consistent explanation of the changes in the syntax and to analyze whether the changes have deep consequences.</p><blockquote><p>“Syntax sugar” is another liberally used term to mark elements of syntax in a derogatory way, implying that its only effect is saving a few keystrokes at a cost of complicating the language’s logic. The named was chosen as a sign of irony, but I should regretfully acknowledge that some readers took it at a face value (sometimes cheering to “finally saying the truth,” sometimes arguing).</p></blockquote><p>When I started to write “That useless Ruby sugar,” I imagined it as a short blog post made of concise sections (a paragraph or two each), dedicated to several latest language changes and investigating where they came from, how they were designed, and how they change the perception of the code.</p><p><strong>The intention was not to “defend” some particular feature or the language as a whole.</strong><span> I wanted to honestly share my </span><em>optics</em><span>, my way of looking at means of expression and integrating them into my mental model.</span></p><p>I decided that each of the chosen syntax features (anonymous block parameters, pattern matching, argument forwarding, and so on) can be covered from the same angles, from reasons of its introduction to consequences and changes in code style, and compared to similar designs in other programming languages.</p><p><span>A “small post” grew into “a very large post,” then into a series of posts published over two months (one of the topics—pattern matching—fractally grew into </span><a href="https://zverok.space/blog/2023-10-20-syntax-sugar2-pattern-matching.html" rel="">three</a><span> </span><a href="https://zverok.space/blog/2023-10-27-syntax-sugar2-pattern-matching-cont.html" rel="">consecutive</a><span> </span><a href="https://zverok.space/blog/2023-11-03-syntax-sugar2-pattern-matching-fin.html" rel="">posts</a><span> on itself— and, trust me, I am praying that the current text wouldn’t turn out too long for a singular final article!)</span></p><p>Despite the appalling underestimation of the amount of writing which cost me some two months of weekly posts, I kinda enjoyed doing it. And it seems to have found its share of grateful and attentive readers (thank you!). For me, it turned out not to be about particular language features. And, to some extent, not even about the particular language (which, though, became a load-bearing pillar of the argument).</p><p><span>I started with a slightly expanded version of “rules of thumb” for understanding, guessing, and memorizing language behaviors I frequently share with colleagues. Eventually, the texts grew into some </span><strong>“thought framework”: the way of looking at the inevitable change of a living language</strong><span>—its cause and the design space of possible implementations, its consequences, and effects.</span></p><p>The essential property of this framework is considering the programming language as a tool for writing and reading first and foremost. I always attempt to see the driving forces behind its evolution as an intention to formulate the intention better.</p><p><span>It is obviously not the only way of looking at programming languages, but it seems to be interesting and insightful enough for the series to have some modest success and a healthy dose of comments. The individual articles frequently caused interesting cross-language discussions, where most participants were not native to Ruby</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-140943987" href="https://zverok.substack.com/p/the-end-of-useless-ruby-sugar-on#footnote-1-140943987" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span><span>.</span></p><p>While amounting to a small book already, the series has a pretty narrow premise: just one way of looking at just a few changes of just one language in a vast universe of them. Still, I think two of the main “driving forces” are important and relevant not only for Ruby.</p><p><span>The first, which I think is common for many mainstream languages and styles, is the </span><strong>tectonic shift from the “classic OO” style</strong><span> of structuring programs (and envisioning them!) to the “small immutable objects + functional algorithms” style. Obviously, it is not the most breaking news (entire languages of Go and Rust that can already be considered mainstream are built on foundations that are quite far from the “classic OO”); it is still interesting to see how the established languages adapt.</span></p><p><span>The second force of the change is more perpetual: it is a </span><strong>natural expansion of language’s—any language’s—thesaurus</strong><span> in response to more and more things previously non-trivial and complicated becoming everyday ones. Concepts that used to require explanation and education become something that you understand from a single mention and want to be expressed in one word. Some decades ago, not every programming language could handle strings properly (Unicode strings, even less so). Today, things like lambdas, sum types, or pattern matching are almost must-haves for expressing everyday thoughts. The baseline shifts constantly.</span></p><p><span>A lot of changes I discussed in the context of Ruby are more universal: most widely used languages continue to adjust as thinking tools to the changing landscape of </span><em>what we are thinking about</em><span>. It seems as universal as a pushback from some part of every language’s community: a pushback from those whose thought process is performed at other layers and who believe that the fabric of the language should stay stable to not “distract” from the materialization of already formed thoughts with the new features.</span></p><p>And every language’s evolution is probably a compromise between those two forces.</p><p>While I hope that some of my observations and conclusions in the series were curious for a broader audience, I am still thinking and writing in and about Ruby.</p><p>One may say that Ruby is my “lens” for looking at problems, both on the pragmatic layers (writing code to understand something) and on the meta-/philosophical layer of looking at how the language adjusts to the changing world to understand the world better.</p><p><span>The important thing about Ruby, which is its curse and blessing, is </span><strong>it isn’t an interesting language</strong><span>. There is no particular “shtick” or wittily-named concept everybody tries to imitate in other languages (well, I think it was part of Ruby’s doing to introduce the functional iterators like </span><code>map</code><span> in the mainstream, but they weren’t invented here).</span></p><p>I believe the premise of the language is something along the lines of “take the modern ideas and put them together with a reasonably minimal number of base concepts, as clearly and expressively as possible without becoming esoteric.”</p><p><em>And I think the reputation of being “weird and whimsical” that the language earned in the 2000s, both amongst its fans and haters, tells more about the state of the industry at that point. An industry where the desire to write in one line what “should’ve” required a class and a package and several methods and initializations and type definitions— when that desire alone made a developer look “unserious.”</em></p><p>In many aspects, Ruby (with its Smalltalk-inspired internal “almost everything is just objects exchanging messages”) achieved remarkable clarity and consistency from a very small set of core concepts—yet not as small to become a “language constructor” instead of a language.</p><p><span>Through the years, it managed to continue staying </span><em>reasonably modern</em><span> without losing the internal consistency and discoverability (though, of course, some Rubyists would have strong dissenting opinions: I think one of the commentators of the series said something along the lines of “I love Ruby but nothing good happened since 2.0”—with 2.0 being ten years old).</span></p><p>Of course, not all of the language’s initial design decisions and accumulated weight is “optimal” or provably best.</p><p>I can list a lot of things I am personally not a big fan of. An early draft of this article had a planned section for some of them— But I recently developed an irrational fear of fractally expanding articles! Though, to name a few:</p><ul><li><p><span>textual </span><code>require</code><span>s and module system could’ve been much cleaner, and I don’t believe “fixing” it with an elaborate constant auto-loading mechanism was the best way forward;</span></p></li><li><p><span>while “code blocks” aka </span><code>Proc</code><span> were a witty way to introduce higher-level functions, the current situation with “callable objects” in Ruby (non-fist-class </span><code>Method</code><span> objects, semi-convention of </span><code>call</code><span> method handling) makes it less powerful than it might’ve been;</span></p></li><li><p><span>the uneven and confusingly supported standard library (my favorite example is </span><code>Date</code><span>/</span><code>Time</code><span> types situation, with </span><code>Time</code><span> being a core object, </span><code>Date</code><span> being part of the standard library mostly dedicated to scientific calculations and many small discrepancies between them);</span></p></li><li><p>(I can continue).</p></li></ul><p><span>The best things are still a reasonably small core of concepts, with the development team working hard to “factorize” any new feature into those concepts, and the flexible syntax that is instrumental for making the core small (like an ability to call a method without parentheses makes </span><code>foo.bar</code><span> attribute-like syntax possible and removing a need to have separate “method” and “property”/”getter” concepts).</span></p><p><span>Those characteristics make Ruby—still—an incredible fit for developing </span><em>domain-specific thesauri</em><span>: new, task-specific parts of the language that would integrate naturally with its rest and would make “thinking in the domain” much easier. I’d distinguish that from a concept of a “domain-specific language,” which frequently implies a </span><em>new</em><span> system of expression, with its logic not necessarily aligned with the implementation language.</span></p><blockquote><p><span>I think Rails was/is a great demonstration of how natural Ruby is in development of that “domain-specific thesaurus.” I just wish sometimes that it would be taken as an example/inspiration for development of many others. Instead, Rails became </span><em>the</em><span> Ruby shtick, and its popularity at some point put Ruby in the domain of “development of support of big systems,” with its reputation and evolution being severely affected by those new circumstances.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Still, for me, Ruby stays a great </span><em>modeling clay</em><span> for experimenting with things and investigating new ideas.</span></p><p><em><strong>Please stop here for a moment.</strong><span> This is your regular mid-text reminder that I am a living person from Ukraine, and a bit of useful related information.</span></em></p><p><em><strong>On the news.</strong><span> Usually, I put “one news item” here. Yet, honestly. It is hard to choose one that happened since my </span><a href="https://zverok.space/blog/2023-12-28-advent-of-changelog-fin.html" rel="">last post</a><span>. We had a lot happening. A prominent young poet </span><a href="https://twitter.com/PenUkraine/status/1744075793855029721" rel="">was killed</a><span> on the front line (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/zverok/status/1744416917392179531" rel="">here, I translated</a><span> some of his poems). Massive missile/drone </span><a href="https://twitter.com/United24media/status/1742224719011594673" rel="">bombardment</a><span> around the New Year, including in my home city (which has continued to be regularly shelled since; say, last week, a missile </span><a href="https://twitter.com/FeministsUa/status/1747695174602420381" rel="">hit</a><span> a private gynecological clinic, and the week before that—a </span><a href="https://twitter.com/United24media/status/1745340529699696643" rel="">hotel</a><span> with foreign journalists). That’s not </span><a href="https://twitter.com/den_kazansky/status/1743684511320133876" rel="">even</a><span> </span><a href="https://twitter.com/United24media/status/1747896573990781438" rel="">mentioning</a><span> </span><a href="https://twitter.com/United24media/status/1748633966255686091" rel="">everyday</a><span> </span><a href="https://twitter.com/United24media/status/1748680827620270192" rel="">attacks</a><span> on civilians in the smaller cities nearer to the front lines. I wonder how much of this gets in the mainstream media of my reader’s countries.</span></em></p><p><em><strong>One piece of context.</strong><span> Today (Jan 20, the day I am finishing this post) is </span><a href="https://twitter.com/DefenceU/status/1748647821803245895" rel="">Memorial Day of Defenders of Donetsk Airport</a><span>. For 242 days, they defended the airport, which disrupted Russia’s plan to transfer forces through it and prevented more Ukrainian territory from being lost in 2014-2015. Yeah, Russia was waging its war then, already.</span></em></p><p><em><strong>One plea.</strong><span> If you are in the US, please call your representative! In DC, you can also join the </span><a href="https://twitter.com/ukrainerallydc" rel="">Ukraine Rally</a><span>, even if for a small amount of time.</span></em></p><p><em><strong>One fundraiser.</strong><span> You can donate to the </span><a href="https://www.ambulanssi.org/en" rel="">Ambulances for UA</a><span> initiative, which buys ambulance vehicles to serve on evacuation missions near the front lines.</span></em></p><p>While the series, as it was invented, is finished, there are a lot of interesting things that are left to think about, at least for me. Maybe some of those things would turn into future articles!</p><p><span>One thinking direction is diving deeper into the “code as readable text” consequences: I think I have some interesting angles on the (arguably aged and trivial) comparison—from the “software project as a magazine” metaphor (slightly touched in the </span><a href="https://zverok.space/blog/2023-12-01-syntax-sugar5-endless-methods.html" rel="">last</a><span> post) to what does it mean to think about a “page of code” (repeated motive of the series), or what would be a modern take on the old idea of “literate programming” with our current knowledge.</span></p><p>Another promising direction is juxtaposing design decisions made by several different programming languages in the same area: after doing it for those few syntax features I covered, I now believe it is a powerful tool for understanding some programming concepts, their design space, and the choices and sacrifices some particular language makes to adopt them.</p><p>And in general, I think a lot about the concept of “language intuitions” and other semi-conscious forces that make us consider some code “good” or “bad,” choose approaches and methods of solving problems, and change our views over time. Trying to find out why we have those intuitions and persuasions, as well as expose, challenge, and formalize them, seems like an interesting topic. (Though, arguably, less “marketable” than “just write software my way and you’ll be good, period.”)</p><p>After all, it is not a language study; it is the study of how we think and write. Or at least that’s what my poet’s mind tells me.</p><p>“Intuition” is an important word for me in the context of programming language understanding (as if somebody hasn’t noticed yet!). As I stated in the intro article of the series:</p><blockquote><p><span>I believe a well-designed, consistent language imposes a lot of implicit </span><em>intuitive</em><span> knowledge about “how things are typically done, what this combination of elements might mean, what this particular name is related to,” and alike. Acquiring those intuitions creates </span><em>fluency</em><span> in reading and writing the code that follows them.</span></p></blockquote><p>Naturally, “Ruby Intuitions” became the name of the book I planned to write in 2022.</p><p>Writing the book on the language that tries to expose this implicit knowledge of Ruby and reflect upon it seemed like a good idea. Still seems, actually. Yet the idea of the book became something akin to my “big white whale”: something that I need a lot of luck, time, focus, and experience to work on, and well— it looks like the time for it hasn’t come yet!</p><p>But, while working on the series of articles, I had an idea for another, simpler (hopefully!) book, which would allow me to gather into one text years of my work on understanding the language, documenting it, and observing its change.</p><p><span>The title I came up with was just “Ruby Evolution,” and currently, in my head, it looks like a reasonable cross-over between my </span><a href="https://rubyreferences.github.io/rubychanges/" rel="">Ruby Changes</a><span> site and essays like this “Ruby Sugar” series, taken over the span of Ruby’s lifetime: an orderly discussion of the most notable changes by versions/topics, the reasons behind them, and a reflection on how it changed the language.</span></p><p>I have a hope that a book like this might be of interest both for Rubyists and for those from other language communities, in a general “history of ideas” context.</p><p>Currently, I am in the early stages of playing with the idea and drafting a table of contents. But I wonder if there would be some interest in such a book?</p><p>In the meantime, I’ll be writing on other topics that will catch my curiosity, more or less related to Ruby, or at least writing code in general.</p><p><em><strong><span>You can subscribe to my </span><a href="https://zverok.substack.com/" rel="">Substack</a><span>, or follow me on </span><a href="https://twitter.com/zverok" rel="">Twitter</a><span>.</span></strong></em></p><p><strong><span>Thank you for reading.

<p>Well, the level of data forgery is pathetically amateurish and excessive. So much that we could only include a fraction of it into this article, you will have to search <strong>Ken Anderson</strong>, <strong>Bill Hahn</strong> and other protagonists on PubPeer to see how bad it all really is. In fact, it is worse, because we only see the tiny tip of the fraud iceberg –  image data duplications, the last resort of a failed scientist after every other trick failed to provdie the desired result. Billions of dollars were burned for this cancerous trash science, but it made many academic careers, some got very rich, and entire dynasties established themselves at Dana Farber. </p>



<p>None of Dana Farber researchers mentioned in this article replied when asked to comment on their PubPeer records.</p>

<h2>Dana-Farberications at Harvard University</h2>



<h2>By Sholto David</h2>



<p>As the whole world furiously argues over whether the president of Harvard did or didn’t use some quotation marks in the right place, scientists at the affiliated Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) must breathe a sigh of relief, no one has bothered to critically read their research in years! Far worse skeletons than plagiarism lurk in the archives…</p>



<h2>Laurie H. Glimcher</h2>



<p>Starting with <strong>Laurie H. Glimcher</strong>, who is the President and CEO of the DFCI. No doubt Laurie built her career on papers like this one, in <em>Nature Immunology</em> (2003), which includes some impressive contributions to art, but perhaps not to science.</p>



<p>Neal N. Iwakoshi, Ann-Hwee Lee, Prasanth Vallabhajosyula, Kevin L. Otipoby, Klaus Rajewsky, Laurie H. Glimcher <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/A52B423E7F819C3E78182A846BD4B3">Plasma cell differentiation and the unfolded protein response intersect at the transcription factor XBP-1</a> <em>Nature Immunology</em> (2003) doi: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/ni907">10.1038/ni907</a></p>

<p>Maybe the coauthor <strong>Klaus Rajewsky</strong> could issue a correction blaming the updated western blot hardware this time (as opposed to “<a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(16)30502-5">updated FlowJo software</a>“).</p>


		
		


<p>Laurie has a curious attitude to correcting her work, although she has replied to one<em> </em>of my less critical <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/323B271C29C74106972B9C28C719BC">comments</a>, she neglected to respond to the above issue (despite prompting); and for the following duplicated flow cytometry plots, she provided this dismissive <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/A653015B2496DDB8EBAF26EBF25E50">response</a>: </p>



<figure><blockquote><p><em>“You should reach out to Dr. Hidde Ploegh- the first author, Dr. Boaz Tirosh was in his laboratory.”</em></p></blockquote></figure>



<p><strong>Well Laurie, it’s your paper, if you care about it being correct, you could very well reach out yourself!</strong></p>

</p><figcaption>Described on PubPeer as “more similar than expected” the plots in fact share all of the datapoints, at least one must be wrong.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Laurie co-authored several papers with <strong><a href="https://forbetterscience.com/tag/claudio-hetz/">Claudio Hetz</a></strong>. This <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02682-5">“star neuroscientist”</a> was investigated by his university, which released a damning report, accusing Hetz of recklessness, negligence, and a problematic attitude to research ethics. Hetz simply expressed regret that he didn’t have access to a better version of Photoshop to more convincingly manipulate his images.</p>

<p>In February 2020 Laurie claimed on PubPeer that she had not been made aware of what happened with <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/29AAEBE60566320997C264E9F83048#5">Hetz’s papers</a> (perhaps she should subscribe to <em>For Better Science </em>email alerts!). In any case this discovery did not prompt her into action, by 2023, only one of the four papers tagged on PubPeer with her and Hetz as co-authors has received a reply from her, and none have been corrected or retracted. For example, this undergraduate level error of miscounted western blot lanes remains in the scientific record, without comment or correction, in the prestigious journal <em>Science</em>, no less:</p>

<p>The above paper has generated a lengthy PubPeer thread, discussing multiple splices in the supplementary figures.</p>

<p>The very next entry on the DFCI <a href="https://www.dana-farber.org/about/leadership">leadership page</a> is Laurie’s deputy, <strong>William C. Hahn</strong> who is the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, as well as a member of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. While Laurie has a few troubling papers and a lamentable attitude to rectifying these errors, Bill has a far more impressive <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=%22William+C.+Hahn%22+OR+%22W+C+Hahn%22">PubPeer record</a>, including 30 search results, with eighteen pertaining to problematic images. Bill is the former postdoc of <strong><a href="https://forbetterscience.com/tag/bob-weinberg/">Robert Weinberg</a></strong>, owner of an impressive <a href="https://pubpeer.com/search?q=%22Robert+A.+Weinberg%22+OR+%22R+A+Weinberg%22">PubPeer record</a> too.</p>

<p>I would encourage anyone interested to look carefully at the blots, the edges very clearly show that these are <strong>not</strong> merely bands with similar shapes, but <em>the same bands</em> copied and pasted.</p>

<p>The stench of the sacked MIT professor <strong><a href="https://forbetterscience.com/tag/david-sabatini/">David M. Sabatini</a></strong> is never far from these discussions. Bill co-authored a 2006 paper in <em>Cell</em> with Sabatini, and also with MIT’s <strong>Eric Lander</strong>, who was previously Joe Biden’s top science adviser, but <a href="https://forbetterscience.com/2022/02/11/schneider-shorts-11-02-2022-a-deeply-caring-person/#lander">resigned</a> following reports of bullying and misogyny.</p>

<p>But don’t rush to alert Roche, their former Global Head of Pharma Research and Early Development was <strong><a href="https://forbetterscience.com/tag/john-reed/">John C Reed</a></strong>, who was previously at Sanofi, and is now at Johnson &amp; Johnson. Good to know that in Big Pharma research is in such safe hands.</p>

<p>And finally for Bill, another paper in <em>Nature</em>, with Bob Weinberg, containing multiple splices, and a mirrored band (I also think the migration of the Large-T bands seems unusual). This paper has over 3000 citations… So probably nothing urgent here for <em>Nature </em>to address?</p>

<h2>Irene M. Ghobrial</h2>



<p>Moving on to <strong>Irene M. Ghobrial</strong>, who is the Senior Vice President for Experimental Medicine at DFCI. Irene works on multiple myeloma, frequently publishing with her DFCI colleagues <strong>Kenneth C. Anderson</strong>, <strong>Nikhil C. Munshi</strong>, <strong>Teru Hideshima</strong>, <strong>Ruben Carrasco</strong>, and <strong>Yu-Tzu Tai</strong>.</p>



<p>What kind of research has elevated Irene to her current position? </p>



<p>In 2012 this epic fail was published, Irene gained ethical approval to aspirate bone marrow from cancer patients and healthy volunteers, but Figure 1 includes three obvious duplications.</p>

</p><figcaption>Two further overlapping areas.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Wouldn’t the volunteers be furious after undergoing such an invasive procedure? Can the data from a paper like this ever be rehabilitated?</p>



<p>Just like hapless Chinese papermills, Harvard scientists struggle with images of crystal violet stained cells. Perhaps this method is just cursed?</p>

<p>Another blunder in troublesome migration and invasion experiments was published with <strong>John Crown</strong>, an Irish politician and member of the 24th Seanad at the time this paper was submitted.</p>

<p>Like her colleagues mentioned above, Irene also has trouble with counting, how many Harvard researchers does it take to count to seven I wonder?</p>

<p>I am also concerned about images of mice. In the figure below, a group of mice has made a knight move across the page, and transitioned between groups.  Thinking about what Irene’s team may have wished to demonstrate (lack of cancer spread in their favoured group) this appears to be a very <em>convenient</em> error.</p>

<p>Another problematic murine figure is shown below. This appears to be nearly entirely fabricated by taking repeated scans of a few mice and labelling them as showing a range of different timepoints and treatment conditions. Look carefully at the positions of the tail, feet, fur, and elements of noise around the mice.</p>

<p>As mentioned previously, Irene frequently publishes with <strong>Kenneth C. Anderson</strong> (you may have noticed above). Ken is also a senior DFCI researcher. Perhaps we can imagine them as Ken and Barbie?</p>

<p>Some of Ken’s associates seem curiously dependent on him for their own research career; DFCI program director and Harvard professor <strong>Nikhil C. Munshi</strong> is a good example (there are others) who appears to have almost no independent activity.</p>

<p>Around 2010 Ken retracted three papers in quick succession (<a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/469D3C5EA2D372518F3CA521BD3BC0">Okawa et al 2008</a>, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/72BC28B138DAC73B48F6758860E76F">Tai et al 2009</a>, <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/8370A8805B9E2535FAF9E29B5D3FF1">Gatt et al 2010</a>), apparently because the cell lines were mixed up, and to be fair, it does seem like mixing things up is rather in Ken’s wheelhouse, but it does leave one wondering… Was an investigation into the affair ever held? Or were the retractions prompted by secret investigation? How much research funding can you waste on these blunders at DFCI without any consequences or any public comment?</p>

<p>As time marches on, methods have become more “genomical”, and in a lot of ways, harder to scrutinize. I had a go at replicating some of the gene expression analysis in Irene’s papers (for example, see <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/9E197B936872497ED77BB37FC49AEA">here</a>), and it doesn’t look hopeful, but it isn’t worth anyone’s time to write such comments if obvious errors in images are going to be left unmolested for years at a time.</p>



<p>In 2017, DFCI’s own future Nobel Prize winner <strong>William G. Kaelin Jr</strong> wrote an opinion piece in <em>Nature</em>, lamenting the proliferation of papers focusing on “impact” rather than robustness, burying weak data in supplements, cherry picking, and other poor practices, he didn’t mention fraud, although there are still some interesting quotes.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“The main question when reviewing a paper should be whether its<br>conclusions are likely to be correct, not whether it would be important<br>if it were true. Real advances are built with bricks, not straw. “</p><cite>William G. Kaelin Jr <em><a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/545387a">Nature</a></em> (2017)</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>What exactly is the building material of choice at DFCI?</p>

    </div><p>A new study led by scientists from Spain and Germany has found a fundamental asymmetry showing that heating is consistently faster than cooling, challenging conventional expectations and introducing the concept of "thermal kinematics" to explain this phenomenon. The findings are published in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41567-023-02269-z"><i>Nature Physics</i></a>.</p>


										      
																																	<p>Traditionally, heating and <a href="https://phys.org/tags/cooling/" rel="tag">cooling</a>, fundamental processes in thermodynamics, have been perceived as symmetric, following similar pathways.</p>
<p>On a <a href="https://phys.org/tags/microscopic+level/" rel="tag">microscopic level</a>, heating involves injecting energy into individual particles, intensifying their motion. On the other hand, cooling entails the release of energy, dampening their motion. However, one question has always remained: Why is heating more efficient than cooling?</p>
<p>To answer this questions, researchers led by Associate Prof. Raúl A. Rica Alarcón from the Universidad de Granada in Spain and Dr. Aljaz Godec from the Max Planck Institute for Multidisciplinary Sciences in Germany have introduced a new framework: thermal kinematics.</p>
<p>Speaking of their motivation behind exploring such a fundamental topic, Prof. Alarcón told Phys.org, "Since childhood, I've been intrigued by why heating is more efficient than cooling. And have questions like: 'Why don't we have a device like a microwave oven for fast cooling?'"</p>
<p>Dr. Godec added, "Thermal relaxation phenomena have always been a big research topic in the group (these are hard problems in non-equilibrium physics). However, specific questions about the heating and cooling asymmetry were initially provoked by mathematical intuition. We did not expect the answer to be so striking."</p>

																																						
																																			<h2>Processes at microscopic scales</h2>
<p>At the microscopic level, heating and cooling are processes involving the exchange and redistribution of energy among individual particles within a system.</p>
<p>In the context of the recent research, the focus is on understanding the dynamics of microscopic systems undergoing thermal relaxation—how these systems evolve when subjected to <a href="https://phys.org/tags/temperature/" rel="tag">temperature</a> changes.</p>
<p>In heating, energy is injected into each particle of a system, leading to an intensification of the particles' motion. This causes them to move more vigorously. The higher the temperature, the more intense the Brownian (or random) motion of these particles due to increased collisions with surrounding water molecules.</p>
<p>On the other hand, cooling at the microscopic level involves the release of energy from individual particles, resulting in a dampening of their motion. This process corresponds to the system losing energy, leading to a decrease in the intensity of particle movement.</p>
<p>"Our work is devoted to the analysis of the evolution of a microscopic system after it is driven far from equilibrium. We consider the thermalization of a microscopic system, i.e., how a system at a given temperature evolves to the temperature of a thermal bath it is put in contact with," explained Dr. Godec.</p>
<p>Prof. Alarcón. further explained, "A clear example would be taking an object from a boiling-water bath (at 100 degrees Celsius) and immersing it in a mixture of water and ice (at 0 degrees Celsius)."</p>
<p>"We compare how fast the system equilibrates with the reverse protocol when the object is initially in the cold bath and heated in boiling water. We observe that, at the microscale, heating is faster than cooling, and we explain this theoretically by developing a new framework we call thermal kinematics."</p>

																																			<h2>Optical tweezers and thermal kinematics</h2>
<p>The researchers employed a sophisticated experimental setup to observe and quantify the dynamics of microscopic systems undergoing thermal relaxation. At the heart of their experimentation were <a href="https://phys.org/tags/optical+tweezers/" rel="tag">optical tweezers</a>—a powerful technique using laser light to capture single microparticles made of silica or plastic.</p>
<p>"These tiny objects move in an apparently random fashion due to the collisions with water molecules, executing the so-called Brownian motion while they are confined to a small region by tweezers. The higher the temperature of the water, the more intense the Brownian motion will be due to more frequent and intense collisions with <a href="https://phys.org/tags/water+molecules/" rel="tag">water molecules</a>," explained Prof. Alarcón.</p>
<p>To induce thermal changes, the researchers subjected the confined microparticles to varying temperatures. They carefully controlled the temperature of the surrounding environment using a noisy electrical signal, simulating a thermal bath.</p>
<p>"Our experimental device allows us to track the motion of the particle with exquisite precision, giving access to these previously unexplored dynamics," said Dr. Godec.</p>
<p>By manipulating the temperature and observing the resulting movements, the team gathered crucial data to understand the intricacies of heating and cooling at the microscale level.</p>
<p>The development of the theoretical framework (thermal kinematics) played a pivotal role in explaining the observed phenomena. This framework combined principles from stochastic thermodynamics—a generalization of classical thermodynamics to individual stochastic trajectories—with information geometry.</p>
<p>"Defining distance and speed in the space of probability distributions, we conducted mathematical proofs using methods from analysis to show that the effect is general," explained Dr. Godec.</p>
<p>Thermal kinematics provided a quantitative means to elucidate the observed asymmetry between heating and cooling processes. This allowed the researchers not only to validate theoretical predictions but also to explore the dynamics between any two temperatures, revealing a consistent pattern of heating being faster than cooling.</p>

																																						
																																			<h2>Asymmetry and Brownian heat engines</h2>
<p>Prof. Alarcón and Dr. Godec discovered an unexpected asymmetry in the heating and cooling processes. Initially aiming to experimentally verify a proposed theory by their colleagues at the Max Planck Institute, the researchers found that the asymmetry extended beyond specific temperature ranges, holding true for heating and cooling between any two temperatures.</p>
<p>The implications of this asymmetry extend to Brownian heat engines—microscopic machines designed to generate useful work from temperature differences.</p>
<p>"Understanding how a system thermalizes with different thermal baths can optimize the power generation process. The equilibration time becomes a key parameter for precisely designing the device's operational protocols," explained Prof. Alarcón.</p>
<p>While no immediate practical applications exist, the researchers envision enhanced efficiency in micromotors, microscale cargo transport, and materials that can self-assemble or self-repair.</p>
<p>The broader implications suggest contributions to the development of new general theories for the dynamics of Brownian systems driven far from equilibrium.</p>
<p>"We expect that the effect is not limited to thermal perturbations, quenches in composition, etc., and will likely display analogous asymmetries. At this point, it is too early to make statements about these situations, but we are certainly already thinking about it," added Dr. Godec.</p>
<p>Prof. Alarcón concluded, saying, "We aim to broaden our findings to various protocols and systems, conducting experiments involving small groups of interacting particles and systems with broken time-reversal symmetry. Advancing theoretical understanding and mathematical control of non-self-adjoint stochastic systems is crucial for this direction. Our ongoing strategy involves concurrent development of experiments and theories."</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body"><p>January 18, 2024</p><p>In this post I'm excited to announce the <a href="https://github.com/RyanBrewer317/SaberVM">Saber Virtual Machine</a>, or SaberVM.
It's a project I've been working hard on for the past month,
with fascinating properties and an in-progress MVP implementation that's
coming along well.
If you like writing functional languages and want a portable backend to target that's fast and/or safe,
you may be very interested in SaberVM, especially in its upcoming AOT-compile-to-optimized-native form.
</p><h3>What is it?
</h3><p>SaberVM is a compiler backend for functional languages.
Specifically, it is an abstract stack machine, with many possible implementations.
It takes in CPS code that's been closure-converted and hoisted,
and executes it or AOT compiles it to a native binary.
My current implementation is a naive bytecode VM in Rust, without JITing, 
mostly for rapid prototyping as the design settles.
</p><p>The goals of the project are safety, expressivity, portability, and reliability.
To give a very quick overview,
safety is achieved through a carefully designed type system, and primarily includes memory safety. 
Expressivity is preserved by using runtime checks and tagging for some of the safety guarantees,
so you can use any convoluted memory scheme you want so long as you don't dereference a dangling pointer.
SaberVM offers portability by being designed to be simple to implement on a variety of platforms.
Lastly, SaberVM is reliable because of a built-in crash recovery system you can use to microreboot 
without the whole program terminating, like Erlang's BEAM.
</p><p>The two main systems of SaberVM are <i>regions</i> and <i>exceptions.</i>
</p><h3>Regions
</h3><p>A region can be thought of as an arena with a malloc/free-style internal memory management system. 
To read or write from the heap, you need a region. It can be the heap itself. 
Regions have statically-checked lifetimes, and a <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/292540.292564">capability</a>-based system 
for checking that values within that region are only read or written to during the lifetime of the region. 
When a region's lifetime ends, it is freed like an arena.
</p><p>This structure of memory is important because in a safe compilation the values in the heap are tagged with information 
about which inhabitant is at that place in memory, so pointers can check that they're 
pointing at the thing they think they are when they're dereferenced. 
This introduces a memory fragmentation issue: 
"slots" in memory can then later be used only by values that are the same size or smaller; they have an unchangeable "max size." 
To prove this, consider two values adjacent in memory, <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>, and their pointers, 
<code>&amp;A</code> and <code>&amp;B</code>. Now say we free both, and allocate <code>C</code> at the same address where <code>A</code> was (that is, <code>&amp;C == &amp;A</code>). 
If <code>C</code> is bigger than <code>A</code> was, then it has arbitrary control of the bytes used to tag <code>B</code>! 
That means a nefarious program could potentially cause <code>&amp;B</code> to think that <code>B</code> is still there, leading dereferences to not crash but 
instead to read memory controlled by <code>C</code> but think that it's <code>B</code>.
</p><p>If allocating something in memory fixes a certain max-size for that chunk of memory for the rest of the program's lifetime, 
that can cause issues from a poor use of memory. 
Therefore, SaberVM puts its values in regions so there are certain points where it's statically known that nothing will 
dereference some set of pointers ever again, so their referent memory can be really freed, with no restriction on its future use. 
As a language writer, if you find your output programs have significant fragmentation issues, 
you can do some light region inference to fix it. 
In addition, since regions are freed like arenas, 
regions offer a way to deallocate a bunch of memory instantly, and improve cache locality.
</p><h3>Exceptions
</h3><p>SaberVM's other interesting system is exceptions. Exceptions in SaberVM are not like normal exceptions, 
though there's nothing stopping a compiler writer from building a normal exception system on top of SaberVM. 
Instead, SaberVM exceptions don't take arguments. Every function must have a catch-all exception case, and only that. 
Why? Having this built-in to SaberVM means that instructions that fail at runtime don't crash your program, 
they just jump to the exception handler. 
The language targeting SaberVM is then expected to produce exception handlers that do at least one of four things:
crash the program (with an explicit halt instruction),
rethrow the exception (that is, jump to the caller's catch-all exception handler),
restart the crashed function (in a microreboot or Erlang style, without information about what caused the exception), or
release held resources (currently SaberVM doesn't have locks, only CAS, but this is likely to change).
</p><p>Note that SaberVM exceptions are <i>not</i> expected to be how your own language handles its exceptions!
For example, if you prefer a <code>Result</code>-style exception handling, 
you can write functions that attempt single fallible instructions with an exception handler that produces 
the corresponding <code>Err</code> value.
</p><h3>Conclusion
</h3><p>SaberVM is carefully designed but still a very young project. 
I have an in-progress <a href="https://github.com/RyanBrewer317/SaberVM">implementation</a> in Rust
that I call the MVP, a subset of the final SaberVM that isn't even necessarily forwards-compatible,
just to play with the ideas and their interactions and see how they really work in practice.
I'm sure as I learn more the design will change somewhat but the core ideas and goals are very strong.
</p><p>I've gotten most of the typechecker done in just a few days, which is really promising,
and the algorithms are very simple. (I'll post more about them soon!)
I think the VM runtime will be easier to write than the typechecker, since it'll be a naive prototype
(without, say, JIT compiling), so I'd say the implementation is about halfway done, which is very exciting.
</p><p>If you've read this far and think that the project sounds interesting, consider
starring it on <a href="https://github.com/RyanBrewer317/SaberVM">github</a>, or even
sponsoring my work on <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/RyanBrewer317">github</a> or

<p>In September 2016, data allegedly obtained from the Chinese gaming website known as <a href="http://aipai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aipai.com</a> and containing 6.5M accounts was leaked online. Whilst there is evidence that the data is legitimate, due to the difficulty of emphatically verifying the Chinese breach it has been flagged as "unverified". The data in the breach contains email addresses and MD5 password hashes. <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/handling-chinese-data-breaches-in-have-i-been-pwned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read more about Chinese data breaches in Have I Been Pwned.</a></p>

<p>In 2014, a file allegedly containing data hacked from <a href="https://www.couponmom.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coupon Mom</a> was created and included 11 million email addresses and plain text passwords. On further investigation, the file was also found to contain data indicating it had been sourced from <a href="https://armorgames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Armor Games</a>. Subsequent verification with HIBP subscribers confirmed the passwords had previously been used and many subscribers had used either Coupon Mom or Armor Games in the past.

<p>In June 2018, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/exactis-database-leak-340-million-records/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the marketing firm Exactis inadvertently publicly leaked 340 million records of personal data</a>. Security researcher <a href="https://www.nightlionsecurity.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vinny Troia of Night Lion Security</a> discovered the leak contained multiple terabytes of personal information spread across hundreds of separate fields including addresses, phone numbers, family structures and extensive profiling data. The data was collected as part of Exactis' service as a "compiler and aggregator of premium business &amp; consumer data" which they then sell for profiling and marketing purposes. A small subset of the exposed fields were provided to Have I Been Pwned and contained 132 million unique email addresses.</p>

<p>In October 2016, data surfaced that was allegedly obtained from the Chinese website known as <a href="http://www.gfan.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GFAN</a> and contained 22.5M accounts. Whilst there is evidence that the data is legitimate, due to the difficulty of emphatically verifying the Chinese breach it has been flagged as "unverified". The data in the breach contains email and IP addresses, user names and salted and hashed passwords. <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/handling-chinese-data-breaches-in-have-i-been-pwned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read more about Chinese data breaches in Have I Been Pwned.</a></p>

<p>In January 2020, the online dating service <a href="https://grahamcluley.com/zoosk-hacking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zoosk suffered a data breach</a> which was subsequently shared extensively across online hacking communities. The breach contained 24 million unique email addresses alongside extensive personal information including genders, sexualities, dates of birth, physical attributes such as height and weight, religions, ethnicities and political views. The breach also allegedly exposed MD5 password hashes, although the data circulating in hacking circles had this field nulled out. The breach was provided to HIBP by <a href="https://breachbase.pw/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">breachbase.pw</a>.</p>

<p>In September 2019, the zoophilia and bestiality forum <a href="https://www.zooville.org/threads/security-incident-and-site-rebuild-september-2019.9/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zooville suffered a data breach</a>. The usernames and email addresses of 71k members were accessed via an unpatched vulnerability in the vBulletin forum software then subsequently distributed online. A second data set was later provided to HIBP which contained a complete vBulletin database dump including IP addresses, dates of birth and passwords stored as bcrypt hashes. The site administrator advised that following the breach, all data had been deleted from the forum and a new one had been stood up on the XenForo platform. The data was provided to HIBP by a source who requested it be attributed to "burger vault".</p>

      By running ads for “free” tax services that many customers were not qualified for, the tax filing software violated the FTC Act and deceived consumers, the agency said.

      The FTC had first sued Intuit, TurboTax’s owner,<strong> </strong>for its deceptive advertising in 2022. The FTC staff alleged most tax filers couldn’t use the company’s “free” services — “<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/09/administrative-law-judge-issues-initial-decision-ftcs-case-against-intuit-inc" target="_blank">such as those who get a 1099 form for work in the gig economy, or those who earn farm income</a>.” TurboTax advertising their products as free misled those customers,<strong> </strong>according to the FTC.

      The FTC Administrative Law Judge D. Michael Chappell announced <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/09/administrative-law-judge-issues-initial-decision-ftcs-case-against-intuit-inc" target="_blank">the initial decision in September</a>, which the commission upheld Monday. Intuit had appealed to the FTC as part of the process.

      In a statement Monday, Intuit said it has appealed “this deeply flawed decision”<strong> </strong>to federal circuit court outside of the FTC.

      “Absolutely no one should be surprised that FTC Commissioners — employees of the FTC — ruled in favor of the FTC as they have done in every appeal for the last two decades. This decision is the result of a biased and broken system where the Commission serves as accuser, judge, jury, and then appellate judge all in the same case,” an an Intuit spokesperson said.

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clrpgzzz800073b6hgb74h3wy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      Intuit cannot advertise or market any goods or services as free unless it’s free for all customers, the FTC ordered.

      It could also clearly disclose the percentage of customers that actually do qualify for the free service, somewhere close to the “free” claim advertised, the commission said. The FTC added if the service isn’t actually free for the majority of consumers, TurboTax could state that as well.

      The FTC ordered Intuit to “disclose clearly and conspicuously all the terms, conditions, and obligations that are required in order to obtain the ‘free’ good or service.”

      “The order also prohibits Intuit from misrepresenting any material facts about its products or services such as the price, refund policies or consumers’ ability to claim a tax credit or deduction or to file their taxes online accurately without using TurboTax’s paid service,” the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/01/ftc-issues-opinion-finding-turbotax-maker-intuit-inc-engaged-deceptive-practices" target="_blank">release</a> from the FTC said.

      Last May, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/09/business/turbotax-settlement/index.html">roughly 4.4 million people </a>were to receive checks from TurboTax, following a 50-state settlement with parent company Intuit for allegedly steering millions of low-income Americans away from free tax-filing services.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The IPv4 protocol, a key element of Internet communication since the 1980s, has effectively served to allocate unique addresses for devices connected to the Internet. However, as the number of devices and services increased, IPv4 became insufficient due to the limited number of addresses. The transition to IPv6, which offers an almost unlimited number of addresses, is necessary to ensure the scalability, security and efficiency of the Internet infrastructure.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-widget-id="18c4613fe625605effd82a986e78fe10"><p dir="ltr">Rioters,</p><p dir="ltr">Today, I’m sharing a decision we hoped we would never have to make at Riot. We’re changing some of the bets we’ve made and shifting how we work across the company to create focus and move us toward a more sustainable future. This decision means we’re eliminating about 530 roles globally, which represents around 11% of our workforce, with the biggest impact to teams outside of core development. This also sadly means we’ll be saying goodbye to many talented colleagues and friends across all areas of Riot.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">I realize this is awful news to hear, and especially hard for those who will be leaving us. To all the Rioters who are being laid off, we are deeply sorry that it has come to this.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">As CEO, I’m accountable for the changes we’re making and where we’re headed in the future. So, I think it’s important for me to share how we got here and how the next few days will work.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>How we got here.&nbsp;</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Since 2019, we’ve made a number of big bets across the company with the goal of making it better to be a player. We jumped headfirst into creating new experiences and broadening our portfolio, and grew quickly as we became a multi-game, multi-experience company — expanding our global footprint, changing our operating model, bringing in new talent to match our ambitions, and ultimately doubling the size of Riot in just a few years.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Today, we’re a company without a sharp enough focus, and simply put, we have too many things underway. Some of the significant investments we’ve made aren’t paying off the way we expected them to. Our costs have grown to the point where they’re unsustainable, and we’ve left ourselves with no room for experimentation or failure – which is vital to a creative company like ours. All of this puts the core of our business at risk.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Over the past several months, we’ve tried to alter our trajectory in many different ways. We asked leaders to make tradeoffs in the things their teams are working on. We rolled out hiring slowdowns, and in some cases hiring freezes. We put an emphasis on controlling costs while strengthening our revenue growth. All of which has without a doubt been tough for our teams.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">But as I’ve dug in with leaders across Riot, it’s become clear to all of us that these changes aren’t enough. We have to do more to focus our business and center our efforts on the things that drive the most player value – the things that are truly worth players’ time. Unfortunately, this involves making changes in the area where we invest the most — our headcount.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">I want to be super clear about something: this is absolutely the last thing we ever wanted to do. A decision like this has a massive impact on people’s lives and on the culture of Riot. We’re not doing this to appease shareholders or to hit some quarterly earnings number – we’ve made this decision because it’s a necessity. It's what we need to do in order to maintain a long-term focus for players.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>How this will work.&nbsp;</strong></p><p dir="ltr">There is no perfect way to do a layoff, but our guiding principle is to do our very best to make sure we’re treating Rioters with respect and grace. We want those who are leaving us to feel supported in this difficult moment. This starts with limiting the time they spend in ambiguity about their role and future with Riot, wherever possible.</p><p dir="ltr">Within the next hour, Rioters around the world will receive an email informing them whether or not their role is, or may be, impacted. This isn’t the usual way we do things, but we wanted to optimize for letting people know as soon as possible, and that’s tough to do at our scale without using email.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Shortly after, every Rioter whose role is or may be impacted will get a calendar invite to meet with their Senior Leader and People team partner and discuss next steps within 48 hours. There's a wide range of local employment processes that have to be followed in situations like these. So, while these meetings will be completed this week in the US, it may take several weeks to finish them around the world as we follow local laws and regulations.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Rioters whose roles are going away, and who aren’t moving into new positions, will be offered:</p><ul><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Severance Pay</strong> — We’ll offer a minimum 6 months of salary, which includes notice period for all Rioters whose roles are going away, and more for those with longer tenure, in line with local laws.&nbsp;</p></li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Cash Bonus</strong> — We’ll offer a cash bonus equal to 1x (100% of) everyone’s individual 2023 Annual Performance Bonus (APB) target, even if Rioters joined within the last year.</p></li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Health Benefits</strong> — In locations where Riot provides healthcare, Rioters covered by our health benefits will continue to be covered through their last day of employment. In addition, they’ll be offered additional pay to cover their health benefits (medical, dental and vision), equal to the length of severance pay, and rounded up to the whole month.</p></li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Play Fund, Wellness Fund, etc.</strong> — We know Rioters may have planned future expenses that would normally be covered by things like the Play Fund &amp; Wellness Fund, so we’re offering an additional $1000 (or local equivalent) to cover these and other types of expenses.</p></li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Equity</strong> — Rioters who have received Riot shares from vesting their single-vesting RSUs will get to keep them, subject to their terms and conditions. This also applies to other vested instruments (like options, or cash-settled SARs in certain jurisdictions such as China). In the event of a future buyback opportunity, we intend to allow these former Rioters to participate. Rioters who hold dual-vesting equity, who have satisfied the service-based vesting component at the time of exit, will be able to vest their equity in the event we have a qualifying liquidity event (like a change-in-control transaction) within the next 12 months.</p></li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Computer</strong> — A laptop is an essential part of finding new work, so after returning their work computers, Rioters will have the option to request a laptop from IT if they don’t have one at home. They can keep their current peripherals like their headset, mouse, and keyboard.</p></li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Career Support</strong> — Rioters will have immediate access to job placement services for 6 months including, career coaching, networking, resume writing and review, and more to help them transition to a new job.&nbsp;</p></li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Rioter Assistance Program</strong> — Rioters will continue to have access to RAP 24/7 for three months after they leave Riot which includes trained counselors who can help with emotional, legal, and financial concerns. In addition, enhanced employee assistance programs (including mental health benefits) will be accessible in a number of locations worldwide. Our local HRBPs will provide information about these programs as available.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Visa Support</strong> — We know this change will be particularly challenging for Rioters who hold visas as part of their employment with Riot. Each situation is unique, and we have dedicated support lined up for those who need it. This includes supporting transitions to non-employment visas where possible. Our Global Mobility team and outside immigration consultants will be in touch with impacted Rioters ASAP to discuss their individual situations.</p></li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Riot Email Access</strong> — Rather than immediately cut off email access, which is more common in these moments, we will continue to provide access to impacted Rioters for a limited time after notification (this will vary by region). We want to make sure Rioters who are leaving us this week have a bit of time to identify and unwind any personal info or accounts that may be tied to their Riot email addresses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p dir="ltr">We’re not expecting this to be a normal, “business as usual” week for us. We’re asking everyone to cancel meetings and rituals over the next few days where possible as we move through these changes together. Also, if you’re at one of our US offices now, we ask that you head home for the rest of the day and work remotely through Wednesday. If you need to come into the office on those days, please respect those who may be having difficult conversations and give them space to process.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What this means for our portfolio.&nbsp;</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Let me start by saying we’re as committed as ever to League PC, VALORANT, TFT, Wild Rift, and to exploration in R&amp;D. In some cases, we’re reshaping our portfolio and teams to develop these games more effectively, but you can expect these to be areas where we continue to invest. Our commitment to esports and entertainment in support of our games is also unchanged. The relationships we have with players are a real differentiator for us, so we’ll continue building the experiences in and around our games that have a meaningful impact on what it feels like to be a player.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">While it's the normal course of business for us to spin projects up and down, we also need to make hard choices when our bets aren’t performing as well as we hoped. We’re making adjustments to some of our R&amp;D efforts across games, esports, and entertainment. We’re also re-thinking the level of support we demand from our enterprise teams. And we’ve made two decisions about our current games portfolio that we want to share with you now. We plan to announce these to players shortly.&nbsp;</p><ul><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">As <strong>Legends of Runeterra</strong> continues its journey, we’re making changes to move the game toward sustainability. We know there’s a passionate community who absolutely love this game, and we do too. However, it hasn't performed as well as we need it to, despite our best efforts. We’ve been subsidizing the cost of development on LoR through our other games, but at this point, that’s just not a viable option. So, we’re reducing the size of the team and shifting our focus to the 'Path of Champions' PvE game mode.</p></li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">In addition, we’re sunsetting <strong>Riot Forge</strong> after the upcoming release of <em>Bandle Tale</em>. Forge has been our collaboration with external studios to develop smaller scale games in our IP. While we’re proud of what we’ve created in this space, and we’re grateful for the Forge team and for our external partners who made these games happen, we don’t view this as core to our strategy moving forward. We aren’t closing the door entirely on single-player experiences or working with other developers if the right project comes along, but we would want it to look pretty different in the future.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p dir="ltr">In early February, we’ll be holding a product focused RiotNow to get deeper into our portfolio and to discuss some of our plans for players in 2024.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>The path forward.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">There’s no way around the fact that this is an extremely sad moment. For those who are leaving… I want to reiterate, we are deeply sorry for the impact this has on you and your family. I can’t thank you enough for everything you’ve done for Riot, and for your dedication to players. We’re committed to doing our best to support you in this moment and through this transition.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">For those who are staying, I know this is a difficult time for you too. You’re not only losing coworkers and friends, but you may also feel uncertain about the road ahead. I want to assure you that our vision for the future remains ambitious – we will not lose our desire to dream for players, and as hard as this moment may be, we will emerge from it in a stronger place. I’m confident that by creating focus together, thinking long-term and operating as One Riot, we’ll be able to truly make it better to be a player.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">While we’d love for this news to remain within our virtual walls, we know that’s not realistic; there are many members of our global community who care deeply about the people who make and support their favorite games. With that in mind, I’m going to share this email publicly on riotgames.com in the hopes that it answers most of their questions so you don’t have to.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">We’re going to hold a Riot WW Town Hall on Thursday to give more context into this moment as well as portfolio changes we’ve made. Until then, I’d like to reiterate my deep gratitude to all the Rioters who are leaving. Your passion and commitment has been felt by the people around you and the millions of players we serve.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr"><br>Dylan&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-widget-id="a116d3a117fd967b46bf48e4927ea1b0"><p dir="ltr">Players,</p><p dir="ltr">Minutes ago, we shared with Rioters that we are refocusing on fewer, high-impact projects to move us toward a more sustainable future. Now, we want to tell you what these changes mean for our games, everything around them (esports, Arcane, music, etc.), and what to expect going forward.</p><p dir="ltr">For most of our history, we’ve managed to avoid days like this, but this decision is critical for the future of Riot. This isn’t to appease shareholders or to hit a quarterly earnings number—it’s a necessity. Over the past few years, as Riot more than doubled in headcount, we spread our efforts across more and more projects without sharp enough razors to decide what players needed most. The adjustments we're making aim to focus us on the areas that have the greatest impact on your experience while reducing investment on things that don’t.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">This means we’re eliminating about 530 roles globally, which represents around 11% of Rioters, with the biggest impact to teams outside of core development. We recognize that many of you don’t just care about the games you play, but also about the people who make them. These are not just organizational changes; they affect individuals and families, and we do our best to approach these decisions with respect and sensitivity. If you’d like to read the email we sent to Rioters, we’ve shared it <a target="_blank" href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/2024-rioter-update">here</a>.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Doubling Down on Games at the Center</strong></p><p dir="ltr">With today’s moves, we’re going back to putting games at the center of everything we do.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Our vision for the future is bold and our commitment to our core live games – League of Legends, VALORANT, Teamfight Tactics, and Wild Rift – is more ambitious than ever. We're prioritizing these teams so they can focus on the content, features, and updates that directly respond to what you’ve been asking for. Expect events, modes, and long-term roadmaps that lead to vibrant (hopefully multi-decade) futures for these games.</p><p dir="ltr">Our strategy will more tightly integrate esports, music, and entertainment with our games. Esports isn't just about competition; it's about the highs, the lows, and the communities that flourish around the games. Entertainment isn't just about storytelling; it's a gateway to the deeper narratives, characters, and worlds that enrich the game experience. As we’ve grown, some of our efforts have become more isolated, and we aspire to more seamlessly blend gameplay, competitive excellence, and narrative depth in ways that truly make it better to be a player. Whether it’s the next hit from K/DA, the story unfolding in Arcane, the intensity of a TFT Open, the one-of-a-kind chills of a Worlds game 5, or the electric atmosphere of VAL Champs, our focus is on quality, impact, and unified experiences for players around the world.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Beyond live titles, we have projects in the pipeline that we can’t wait to get to you when they’re ready. Project L has been making great progress and we’re looking for more opportunities for you to try out the game (stay tuned for more updates coming later this year). Arcane Season 2 is on track for November 2024. Plus, we have a number of projects cooking in various stages of R&amp;D.</p><p dir="ltr">Our volume of releases will never be massive. We want everything we deliver to be something that you can be proud of and excited to share with friends. That requires having financial flexibility to be able to take the time to make things that are truly great for players. We know we’ll still have occasional misses, but we want those misses to be for the right reasons, not because we prioritized the wrong things or had to rush projects out the door before they were ready.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Legends of Runeterra and Riot Forge</strong></p><p dir="ltr">We want to specifically address two areas where you’ll see immediate impact from today’s changes: Legends of Runeterra and Riot Forge.&nbsp;</p><ul><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">As LoR continues its journey, we’re making changes to move the game toward sustainability. We know there’s a passionate community who absolutely love this game—we do too. Despite critical achievements and the role it’s played in helping to build out the world of Runeterra, LoR has faced financial challenges since launch, costing significantly more to develop and support than it generates. In response, we're reducing the size of our team and renewing our focus on The Path of Champions. This shift allows the team to experiment more in the PvE space, concentrating on the game mode where players have been spending the most time. The LoR team has more details <a target="_blank" href="https://playruneterra.com/en-us/news/game-updates/state-of-the-game-2024">here</a>, and we have a video planned for the coming weeks to talk more about the future.</p></li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">We’re ending new game development under Riot Forge after the upcoming release of <em>Bandle Tale: A League of Legends Story</em>. Forge was an experiment to see what would happen when Rioters partnered with their favorite indie devs and let them loose on Runeterra with their unique viewpoints, styles, and expertise. Across six titles spanning different game genres, regions, and characters, it’s been inspiring to see what these devs created in partnership with the Forge team. We’re proud of what we’ve done together to bring these stories to life, but it’s time to refocus our efforts on the ambitious projects underway internally at Riot.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>The Journey Ahead with You</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Our strategy moving forward is clear: we’re honing in on what we do best and what resonates most with you. Every endeavor, from development to storytelling to competition, will be crafted to deliver meaningful, memorable experiences with games at the center.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">While change can bring uncertainty, it also presents opportunities for growth and innovation. We’re grateful for your ongoing support; nothing Riot has ever created would be possible without you. Your passion and engagement inspire us every day, and we’re excited to continue this journey together.</p><p dir="ltr"><br>Dylan &amp; Marc</p></div></div>]]></description>

      We have a production team, around half of whom live in Brooklyn and Manhattan, and the others live in places like Chicago, Mexico City and San Francisco.

      The internet and cell phones obviate so much of what was once done at the office, which is, after all, largely an artifact of the 20th century thanks to the rise of mass transportation, the ability to build tall office buildings and the previous immovability of the “work” telephone, which was stuck to a desk. All this, thankfully, is going the way of the dodo.

      During the office era, so many workers spent so much time at their desks that workplaces often tried to present themselves as some kind of alternative family.

<article id="post-5966">

<p><em>This article was written by Thomas Opsomer </em><br><em><br></em>Say you replaced your corded vacuum cleaner with a battery-powered one a few years ago. Initially you were thrilled with the convenience of not dragging a cord around, but by now the battery barely holds enough of a charge to make it to the other end of your living room. So, you pass by the store to ask about a new battery – only to learn that just the part <a href="https://fixpart.be/nl/product/bosch-siemens-12031574-accu-stofzuiger#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">costs about as much as a new vacuum</a> and on top of that there will be labor costs, so it would make much more sense to replace your vacuum with this great new model they have on sale. Sounds familiar?</p>



<p>For many years, Right to Repair activists have been <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/9712/expensive-washing-machine-repair" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">denouncing outrageously high spare parts prices</a> that effectively eliminate repair as an option, often making it more expensive than replacement. And while over these last few years, a lot has happened for the right to repair both in the EU and the US, not that much has actually changed for consumers faced with broken appliances.</p>



<p>For vacuum cleaners, washing machines and a handful of other products, repairability requirements have now been laid down in Ecodesign regulations. Manufacturers need to make sure that key parts are removable with commonly available tools and are made available to professional repairers for a number of years after the last unit is sold. All of which goes a long way toward making repair possible… But these requirements still ignore one of the biggest problems: the price of spare parts<sub><sup>. (1) </sup></sub> </p>



<p><strong>The part is more than the whole</strong></p>



<p>For about 5 years now, we’ve been keeping an eye on the price of <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/9712/expensive-washing-machine-repair" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a particular circuit board for a washing machine</a> as it fluctuated between 299€ and 1073€—which is more expensive than the whole of the machine ever cost. Surely a glitch? Don’t be so sure. When looking into spare prices in more detail as we were preparing for our ‘<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcBbBdmdvuc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Price is Right’ game</a>, we had no trouble at all finding similar examples for various products, ranging from a Samsung LCD panel that costs nearly 25% more than the TV that it’s used in, to a <a href="https://www.gardena.com/nl/producten/spareparts/motor/520437901.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">60€ motor</a> for a <a href="https://www.amazon.com.be/-/en/Gardena-SmallCut-Electric-Trimmer-Cutting/dp/B0811VFQ6D/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gardena grass trimmer that costs only 37€, shipping included</a> (see image).<sup>(2)</sup> That’s over 160% of the product price, for a single part! Unless you find a repairer that’s <em>willing to pay you </em>for the opportunity to repair your lawn trimmer, that doesn’t leave much room for any repair scenario, does it?</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/YcbEGyuxevWYiUq83tPUs0oNPOLsbEGTYxGOTHMataONQ4mKeaU1FDl83Gr9fir5vzoJNb5gNmmRF--X4Iu5390jmm0AUJOTv1WiqDQF6doJzcJubMMsjDoIvwggOh4w_8_XnN8-Uwcp6pzG19-ID_E" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E"></figure>

<p><em>37€ for the whole trimmer, 60€ for its motor. That’s a bad day for repair.</em></p>



<div><p>Now these are quite extreme examples, but it actually takes much less to kill any chance of repair. Most people will only consider a repair if the total cost of the repair is less than 30–40% of the product value.<sup>(3)</sup> Given that the cost of any given repair is usually composed of labor cost and spare parts cost (assuming there is no transportation cost for the repairer), in order for the repair to stay below the critical threshold, it is reasonable to estimate that the price of spare parts should stay below 15-20% of the product price.<sup>(4)</sup></p><p>Key parts such as batteries, motors, control boards and display panels very often exceed this threshold, but&nbsp; even the most mundane of parts can come at a surprisingly high cost. Imagine <a href="https://fixpart.be/fr/produit/adaptateur-electrique-msi-s930409270c54" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being charged 253€ for a replacement charger</a> for your MSI laptop, or <a href="https://www.directrepair.be/nl/korf-vaatwasser-boven-1799507600-beko.html?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=free-listings&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwkY2qBhBDEiwAoQXK5XiFj-_S6xQyLXGqKTIjuaQx_e0AFcR8_emHO8yR8JwnTzD6JmaH3RoCJx8QAvD_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">214€ for a wire basket</a> for your Beko dishwasher.

You will quickly realize that it doesn’t make much economic sense to have a repairer come over to your house to replace it. With no room left for any labor cost, it’s no wonder that small repair businesses are having a hard time keeping afloat.</p></div>



<p><strong>Bundling</strong></p>



<p>One typical reason why parts can be very costly, is a practice called <em>bundling</em>. This means that instead of selling individual parts, manufacturers only offer certain spare parts as an assembly or group of parts. This can be related to poor design choices—as in the case of a Macbook Air with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/butterfly-keyboard-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">failure-prone keyboard that cannot be separated from the top housing, leading to a 500€ repair cost</a>. However bundling can also just be a matter of policy. This is the case for the above mentioned washing machine example, for which you have to buy a set consisting of two circuit boards, a knob and several other plastic parts even if just the display goes bad. These are technically different parts that can be individually replaced; it’s just that the manufacturer chose to not sell them individually. You could break something as trivial as a closing lid for a laser printer and find that it is only available together with the laser unit, setting you back a hefty 553€.<sup>(5)</sup> A particularly striking example we came across is a single, non-standard screw (if you must know it has a <em>left-hand trapezoidal thread</em>) used to fix the base plate to a <a href="https://www.toolmax.nl/ste-140-decoupeerzaag-750-watt-in-metabox-145.html?utm_source=adhouse7&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_term=%5B201863-66745%5D%5Bec3dd4bf-05d7-4d83-9bbe-0dfd4d3d88eb%5D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">265€ Metabo jig saw</a>. The screw is not available for sale separately: you have to buy the whole base assembly (see image). <a href="https://www.toolmax.nl/metabo-316065980-grondplaat.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cost: 49€</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>These are all the parts of a jig saw you have to buy even if you just need the screw at the bottom left…</em></p>



<p><strong>Price setting</strong></p>



<p>Bundling is just one of the ways in which some manufacturers make parts unnecessarily expensive. The simplest way is obviously to just set a high price for the parts. So what determines the price of spare parts? As with any product, a manufacturer’s price setting takes into account a series of considerations including production, transportation and storage costs as well as supply and demand, market segmenting and of course general company strategy. Hence, there can be a number of reasons for the high prices of spare parts.</p>



<p>Now we’re not saying that cost doesn’t play a role. It is true that managing a parts inventory over time is a costly affair—it’s definitely easier to sell a container of gadgets and forget about it. But the spread of prices that we encounter in the parts market is so absurdly large that it’s hard to explain based on cost factors alone. In some cases, it seems clear that manufacturers are simply applying extortionate profit margins to spare parts (a member of the EU Parliament leading work on <a href="https://repair.eu/news/broad-support-for-repair-in-the-imco-committee-of-the-eu-parliament-will-the-council-keep-up-with-the-ambition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new regulations to enable repair</a> recently said that <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20231027-how-the-right-to-repair-might-change-technology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it reminded him of cartels</a>). The very least one can say is that most producers<em> wouldn’t be upset</em> if you bought a whole new appliance instead of paying for a part.</p>



<p><strong>Lack of competition and transparency</strong></p>



<p>Astute readers may have noticed one typical element missing from the price setting factors listed above: competitiveness. Indeed, competition is normally a key element that affects product prices, and it is counted on by many policy makers to also solve the repair cost issue. However, when it comes to spare parts, there is very little actual competition. At the risk of stating the obvious: you can’t just go shopping with Bosch and Miele to find a cheaper part for your AEG washing machine. Once you’re at the repair stage, you’re pretty much at the mercy of the brand owner, who often has a monopoly on spare parts and can therefore charge you any price they like. Whatever you choose—pay for an overpriced part or buy a new appliance—it’s a win for the industry.</p>



<p>So the trick is to take spare part prices into account well before you’re in need of repair: that is, when deciding which appliance to buy. However, this requires transparency on spare parts prices at that point in time. Some brands, such as those of the French SEB group, have made repairability into a major selling point. In principle, SEB aims to limit spare parts prices to max. 50% of the product price—although you may still end up <a href="https://www.midi-pieces-menager.fr/hachoir-moulinex-moulinette-compact-dj300/193180-ss-194295-moteur-complet-hachoir-moulinette-compact-dj300-moulinex-3077000003512.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paying about 18€ for the motor</a> of <a href="https://www.amazon.com.be/Moulinex-DJ300110-Hachoir-Electrique-Moulinette/dp/B00I96MAXC" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a 28€ Moulinex chopper (produced by SEB)</a>, for a 60% part-to-product price ratio.<sup>(6)</sup> Other brands don’t share any information about their spare parts price policy, making it impossible for you to make an informed decision.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For some products, the French <em>indice de réparabilité </em>can help you take this into account, in order to choose a <a href="https://www.indicereparabilite.fr/produit/lave-linge-hublot-samsung-ecobubble-ww90t634dhh-9-kg-induction-1400-trs-min-blanc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">washing machine that scores 10/10 for spare parts price</a> instead of <a href="https://www.indicereparabilite.fr/produit/lave-linge-lave-linge-hublot-electrolux-ew2f6712bs-7-kg-1400-trs-min-blanc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one that scores 2,5/10</a>, or a <a href="https://www.indicereparabilite.fr/produit/televiseur-lg-65gx3-tv-oled-uhd-4k-65-165cm-smart-tv-4xhdmi-3xusb-dolby-atmos-noir/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TV that scores 7,5/10</a> instead of <a href="https://www.indicereparabilite.fr/produit/televiseur-lg-oled65cx6-tv-oled-uhd-4k-65-164cm-smart-tv-dolby-vision-iq-4-x-hdmi-3-x-usb-classe-a/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one that scores 0/10</a>.<sup>(7)</sup> However, you cannot search for or filter products by spare parts score on any website. You have to check them one by one by reviewing the scoring grid, which may not even be available online—although the seller is legally required to provide it upon request.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ideally, we would create the necessary transparency at the EU level. However, <a href="https://repair.eu/news/new-eu-rules-for-smartphones-and-tablets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our efforts to get spare part prices included in the first EU-wide repairability score (for smartphones) were to no avail</a>. Smartphone manufacturers will have to communicate parts prices from 2025 onwards—but nothing says they can’t change them at will after you’ve bought your phone.</p>



<p>Wouldn’t it be so much easier if all manufacturers (not just for the handful of products we can expect to cover with new Ecodesign rules in the following years) had to list spare part prices on their website? Better yet, what if manufacturers had to stick to their originally published prices over time (or at least keep variations due to inflation or changes in logistics within reasonable limits)? Together, these two transparency measures would ensure prices stayed comparable instead of having them fluctuate all over the place, as was the case for that washing machine board that ranged from 299€ to 1073€. Add to that an EU repair score taking parts prices into account, and consumers would finally be able to make an informed choice when shopping for repairable products.</p>



<p><strong>Aftermarket parts</strong></p>



<div><p>Now interestingly, when competition <em>is</em> at work, it does indeed drive down prices—and it gives us an idea of the sometimes insane profit margins that brand owners apply to spare parts.</p><p>For instance, various models of washing machines and dishwashers use the same type of pumps, valves, heating elements and such, which appliance manufacturers often get as off-the-shelf parts from their own suppliers. In such cases, a repairer may be able to source the same or a similar part from an aftermarket supplier, who could even be the original manufacturer of the part—even though, <a href="https://www.figiefa.eu/en/publications/new-competition-law-framework.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">contrary to automotive parts manufacturers</a>, the part manufacturer can’t advertise the completely identical part as ‘original’ if it doesn’t carry the product brand name.</p><p>It is not rare for such aftermarket parts to cost only a fraction of the brand price: a Samsung heating element costs a repairer over 50€ (ex. VAT) whereas a generic one only costs 12€, and a generic inlet valve replacing a 51€ Candy part will sell for around 5,50€ (see image).</p></div>

<p>The same goes for your Dyson vacuum cleaner motor and your Bose headphone earpads. And should the carburettor of your Husqvarna brushcutter need servicing, a set of just three rubber gaskets the size of a postage stamp will <a href="https://www.wolfswinkel.nl/husqvarna-onderdelen-parts/580684801/packningssats" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">set you back 47€ when bought from the product brand</a>, <a href="https://www.techniekwebshop.nl/membraanset-walbro-d20wat-d20-wat.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">12€ when bought from the very manufacturer that makes them for the brand</a>, and <a href="https://www.sosmembranes.com/42-kit-membranes-d20-wat-pour-walbro.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">only 5€ from a generic aftermarket supplier</a>. While there may be subtle differences in quality between some of these parts, a 900% markup is hard to justify —and one can understand how some repairers would simply <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nww5Hm5BAT8&amp;t=133s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">call this a rip-off</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Used parts</strong></p>



<p>Second-hand parts scavenged from discarded products may also offer a solution. Remember that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/butterfly-keyboard-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">500€ keyboard repair</a> we mentioned earlier? You can also get a <a href="https://www.appleparts.nl/Topcase-incl.-keyboard-voor-MacBook-Pro-Retina-15-inch-A1398-jaar-2015-EU-layout?gclid=Cj0KCQjwqP2pBhDMARIsAJQ0CzoRNlyaKlYsYwME3WWxL9fdruvvFuEUraOrAvOy415lVcGYL4EbctkaAtqIEALw_wcB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">refurbished keyboard for 99€</a>. This may also save you if you need a part that the manufacturer no longer provides, such as a <a href="https://eustore.ifixit.com/products/macbook-pro-15-retina-mid-2012-early-2013-left-fan?variant=46804202029396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cooling fan for that same MacBook</a>. Long-time repairers and thrift stores that recover electric appliances often have shelves full of harvested parts that they can use to fix a variety of appliances both old and new (see image).</p>

<p><strong>Serialisation limits opportunities</strong></p>



<p>However, the use of aftermarket and used parts might soon come to an end, as product manufacturers are increasingly using a technique called <a href="https://repair.eu/news/part-pairing-a-major-threat-to-independent-repair/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>parts pairing</em></a> to restrict the use of non-original as well as recovered original parts. This means that the product refuses to operate normally, or even at all, if it detects the presence of a part – ‘original’ or not – that was not installed at the factory. Parts pairing is <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/69320/how-parts-pairing-kills-independent-repair" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already used in a wide variety of products</a> ranging from smartphones, computers and game consoles over coffee machines and blenders to tractors and other machinery, and it may soon spill over to just about any product that has any electronic components.</p>



<p><strong>What’s the solution?</strong></p>



<p>The spare parts price problem could be solved with regulations, through competition, or both. If we’re serious about repairing products instead of chucking them out, manufacturers should simply be required to offer spare parts at reasonable prices. The current proposal on <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/consumer-protection-law/consumer-contract-law/rules-promoting-repair-goods_en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">common rules promoting the repair of goods</a> offers a unique chance to create an obligation for fair prices for all spare parts. If on the other hand we are counting on competition to really drive spare parts prices down, we need transparency on the prices charged by brand owners as well as a level playing field for the use of new original parts, aftermarket parts and used parts. This requires a complete ban on anti-repair practices such as parts pairing and parts bundling. Ideally, we need all of this… In short, we need a <a href="https://repair.eu/news/we-need-the-right-to-repair-to-be-universal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Universal Right to Repair</a>.</p>

<p>Google, AT&amp;T, and Vodafone are investing $206.5 million in AST SpaceMobile, a Starlink competitor that plans to offer smartphone service from low-Earth-orbit satellites.</p>
<p>This is the first investment in AST SpaceMobile from Google and AT&amp;T, while Vodafone had already put money into the satellite company. AST SpaceMobile announced the funding <a href="https://feeds.issuerdirect.com/news-release.html?newsid=7412658762974268">in a press release</a> on Thursday and announced a <a href="https://feeds.issuerdirect.com/news-release.html?newsid=6351576236133684">$100 million public offering</a> of its stock on the same day.</p>
<p>"Vodafone and AT&amp;T have placed purchase orders for network equipment from AST SpaceMobile to support planned commercial service," the satellite company said. Google has meanwhile "agreed to collaborate on product development, testing, and implementation plans for SpaceMobile network connectivity on Android and related devices." AST, which has one <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/12/a-new-satellite-has-become-one-of-the-20-brightest-stars-in-the-sky/">very large test satellite</a> in orbit, previously received investments from Rakuten, American Tower, and Bell Canada.</p>
<p>SpaceX subsidiary Starlink has deals <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/01/starlink-shows-off-first-texts-to-t-mobile-phones-sent-via-spacex-satellite/">with T-Mobile</a> in the US and several carriers in other countries for satellite-to-smartphone service. T-Mobile is expected to offer Starlink-enabled text messaging this year, with voice and data service beginning sometime in 2025.</p>
<p>Though AT&amp;T hadn't previously invested in AST SpaceMobile, the companies were already working together. AT&amp;T is leasing spectrum in the 700 MHz and 850 MHz bands to AST SpaceMobile. They plan "to provide mobile broadband to unserved and underserved areas covered by the Leased Spectrum," the companies <a href="https://wireless2.fcc.gov/UlsEntry/attachments/attachmentViewRD.jsp?applType=search&amp;fileKey=1280167087&amp;attachmentKey=21752225&amp;attachmentInd=applAttach">told the Federal Communications Commission</a> in an application last year.</p>

<h2>For hard-to-reach areas</h2>
<p>Satellite-to-smartphone technology is generally seen as a supplement to cellular networks in hard-to-reach areas. "Because AST's technology can focus satellite coverage in discrete portions of licensed areas, it does not need a nationwide swath of terrestrial mobile spectrum that a mobile network operator licensee has left fallow. Rather than displacing terrestrial network facilities nationwide, AST's coverage will be complementary to AT&amp;T's extensive terrestrial network coverage," the companies' FCC filing said.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>In April 2023, the companies <a href="https://feeds.issuerdirect.com/news-release.html?newsid=7696581327990775">announced</a> that they completed the first two-way voice calls using AST SpaceMobile's test satellite with standard mobile phones. "The first voice call was made from the Midland, Texas area to Rakuten in Japan over AT&amp;T spectrum using a Samsung Galaxy S22 smartphone," the announcement said.</p>
<p>In September 2023, AST SpaceMobile <a href="https://ast-science.com/2023/09/19/ast-spacemobile-achieves-space-based-5g-cellular-broadband-connectivity-from-everyday-smartphones-another-historic-world-first/">said</a> it made "the first-ever 5G connection for voice and data between an everyday, unmodified smartphone and a satellite in space" and that it achieved a download rate of 14Mbps.</p>
<h2>Five satellites should launch soon</h2>
<p>AST SpaceMobile's prototype satellite launched from a SpaceX rocket in September 2022. AST's <a href="https://fcc.report/IBFS/SAT-PDR-20200413-00034/2257215.pdf">early plans</a> detailed in 2020 called for 243 satellites overall, and its first five satellites for commercial operations are <a href="https://feeds.issuerdirect.com/news-release.html?newsid=6848126104966869">expected to launch</a> by March 31, 2024. AST is manufacturing the satellites at its Texas facilities.</p>
<p>The prototype satellite delivers data over 5 MHz channels. "For the company's planned operational satellites, beams are designed to support capacity of up to 40 Mhz, potentially enabling data transmission speeds of up to 120Mbps," the company said.</p>
<p>An AST <a href="https://ast-science.com/spacemobile-network/our-technology/">description</a> of its satellite says it has "a large surface area of phased-array antennas, which work together to electronically form, steer, and shape wireless communication beams into cells of coverage," similarly to cell towers on the ground. AST says its <a href="https://ast-science.com/spacemobile-network/bluewalker-3/">BlueWalker 3 test satellite</a> is 693 square feet.</p>
<p>AST said it has "over 40 agreements and understandings with mobile network operators globally, who collectively service over 2 billion subscribers." Besides Vodafone and AT&amp;T, these "agreements and understandings" are with firms including Rakuten Mobile, Bell Canada, Orange, Telefonica, TIM, MTN, Saudi Telecom Company, Zain KSA, Etisalat, Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison, Telkomsel, Smart Communications, Globe Telecom, Millicom, Smartfren, Telecom Argentina, Telstra, Africell, and Liberty Latin America.</p>
<p>While Starlink already has <a href="https://planet4589.org/space/con/star/stats.html">over 5,000 satellites</a> delivering home Internet service and plans to launch <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/01/spacex-aims-to-launch-2nd-gen-starlink-satellites-soon-but-amazon-seeks-delay/">tens of thousands</a> more, it isn't too far ahead of AST SpaceMobile in terms of cellular-enabled satellites. SpaceX <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/01/spacex-launches-first-starlink-satellites-that-will-work-with-t-mobile-phones/">launched the first six Starlink satellites</a> that can provide cellular transmissions to standard LTE phones a few weeks ago and demonstrated the technology with text messages sent between T-Mobile phones.</p>

<p>A New York-bound Virgin Atlantic flight was canceled just moments before takeoff last week when an alarmed passenger said he spotted several screws missing from the plane’s wing. </p>



<p>British traveler Phil Hardy, 41, was onboard Flight VS127 at Manchester Airport in the UK on Jan. 15 when he noticed the four missing fasteners during a safety briefing for passengers and decided to alert the cabin crew. </p>



<p>“I’m a good flyer, but my partner was not loving the information I was telling her and starting to panic, and I was trying to put her mind at rest as much as I could,” Hardy told the Kennedy News agency of the moment he spotted the missing fixings. </p>



<p>“I thought it was best to mention it to a flight attendant to be on the safe side.”</p>



<p>Engineers were promptly called out to carry out maintenance checks on the Airbus A330 aircraft before its scheduled takeoff to John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City, a Virgin Atlantic rep said.  </p>

<p>Footage shot by Hardy showed one of the engineers climbing onto the plane’s wing before using a screwdriver to tinker with some of the fasteners.</p>



<p>Hardy said airline staff repeatedly reassured him there was no safety issue with the wing, but his fear was heightened given the recent ordeal in which an <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/01/08/news/passengers-recount-fearing-for-lives-on-alaska-airlines-flight/">Alaska Airlines plane lost its door plug and a chunk of its fuselage flew off mid-flight</a>. </p>



<p>Both Virgin and Airbus stressed there was no impact to the safety of last week’s aircraft despite the missing fixings.</p>

<p>The Virgin representative said the flight ended up being axed to “provide time for precautionary additional engineering maintenance checks, which allowed our team the maximum time to complete their inspections.</p>



<p>“The safety of our customers and crew is always our top priority and this was not compromised at any point,” the rep said in the statement. “We always work well above industry safety standards and the aircraft is now back in service.”</p>



<p>Neil Firth, the Airbus local chief wing engineer for A330, added that the affected panel was a secondary structure used to improve the aerodynamics of the plane. </p>

<p>Betsy Anderson’s luck with refrigerators stinks as badly as the food she’s tried to keep cold.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“One morning I went to get milk out and it was sour,” said the Redwood City homeowner.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>First, a $2,800 Kenmore Elite fridge — with an LG compressor inside — died in late 2019. “It was like 15 months old,” she said. “It basically stopped working. It wasn’t cold.”</p>

<p>Anderson filed for warranty service. But after two months of replacement parts failing, techs canceling service calls, and Thanksgiving approaching, she broke down and bought another fridge: a brand-new LG.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Groundhog day: $2K fridge edition</h2>

<p>It only lived four years. “That just died, this year. Same thing. And I didn’t even bother calling them,” Anderson said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you’re keeping score, that’s one Redwood City home with two dead fridges in just five years. </p>

<p>“Yeah, two,” Anderson said. “Unfortunately, we bought another LG fridge. So, I guess that’s the definition of insanity, right?”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Betsy’s not alone. We searched our nationwide Responds complaint database. Over the past few years, our NBC and Telemundo sister stations around the country have heard from dozens of upset LG and Kenmore owners.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Terese in Philadelphia said her fridge failed when it was “only seven months old.” Bernadette in San Diego said “technicians have been to my home seven times.” That sounds a lot like Kaare in LA’s story… “[The] fix lasted one week. I have had a total of six repair visits and have not had a working refrigerator for two months.”</p>

<p>Some frustrated fridge owners are heading to court.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Fed up and off to federal court</h2>

<p>“It’s a nationwide issue,” said Los Angeles attorney Azar Mouzari. She represents plaintiffs who are now suing LG. She says her firm is focused on a critical part called the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lsrYCBPReE" target="_blank">linear compressor</a> inside LG and some Kenmore refrigerators. “Which is really the heart of the refrigerator," Mouzari said. "It’s what keeps the food cold.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to LG literature, the linear compressor uses less energy and makes less noise than other compressors. LG offers a 10-year warranty and, online, boasts “20-year durability.” But Mouzari argues in the lawsuit the linear compressor’s actual lifespan is nowhere near 10 years, let alone 20. Her suit claims they frequently break down far earlier — and LG knows it. </p>

<p>Mouzari is asking a federal judge to make her clients' lawsuit a class action because she believes droves of families are facing the same breakdown. “Thousands, if not tens of thousands,” she said. “We have been inundated with calls.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Old problem, new claim: fraud</h2>

<p>LG previously faced litigation over its refrigerator, including compressor failures. In 2018, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.lgfridgesettlement.com/" target="_blank">LG settled a different, class-action lawsuit</a>. Mouzari’s suit is new. And it makes a new claim: fraud. She argues in the suit that LG is defrauding people like Betsy Anderson because it continues to make a linear compressor that falls short of its “20-year durability.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>“We know that they’ve known about this issue. And they know the rate of failure is just unreasonably high,” Mouzari said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mouzari also names in her suit several major national chain stores that sold LG and Kenmore refrigerators. “Because those retailers were aware of the issue,” she explained.&nbsp;</p>

<p>NBC contacted LG and Kenmore about the lawsuit. LG told the NBC Los Angeles Responds team that the company does not comment on pending litigation. It is fighting the suit in court.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When LG settled the previous class action suit, the agreement said LG, “specifically denies any alleged defect in the LG refrigerators.” Kenmore says it no longer sells refrigerators with an LG compressor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mouzari says the new lawsuit is gaining traction.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>100+ plaintiffs, so far</h2>

<p>“Currently, we have 102 plaintiffs,” she noted. “We are getting calls all the time.”</p>

<p>She wants LG to extend people’s warranties up to 20 years. And refund anyone who says they bought a dud LG or Kenmore after 2018. People like Betsy Anderson.</p>

<p>“It’s a tremendous hassle,” she said. “I think they should make it right. And I think they should do a recall like an automaker.”</p>

<p>If you bought an LG or Kenmore refrigerator after 2018, you can <a href="http://bhtrialattorneys.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">contact Mouzari’s firm</a> to learn more about the lawsuit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Inngest manages the event streams, queues and state all within the platform. Environments are created and functions are automatically deployed for <a href="https://www.inngest.com/blog/branch-environments">every branch of your codebase</a>. Teams might deploy <em>hundreds</em> of functions to Inngest across tens of branches, leading to thousands of functions reacting to events in real time (within ~10-100ms).</p>
<p>As we scaled to <strong>thousands of users who have triggered billions of functions to run</strong>, we learned a great deal about the challenges developing a platform built on queues.</p>
<p>Attempting to build a system like this with any off-the-shelf queuing system is quickly going to become a struggle. Here are some of the key challenges that you will encounter:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fairness</strong>.  You send 5,000 events per second. Not hard to manage, but in a single queue your jobs will block other users' work from running. That's not fair. One user should not be able to block another's work.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-tenancy</strong>.  Most queues operate on a "worker" model: you specify which queues a worker should listen to, and the amount of jobs that worker can handle. Spinning up new workers for each function is tedious and cumbersome. It's made worse given that development branches are ephemeral and bursty.</li>
<li><strong>Contention</strong>.  With thousands of customers running thousands of step functions containing parallel steps, at any given time there are millions jobs available for work. In typical queueing systems, workers will all contend for the earliest job available, leading to <em>lots</em> of spinning and wasted effort.</li>
<li><strong>Concurrency</strong>.  Customizing concurrency at a function level across distributed workers is not possible in other queueing systems. Typically, concurrency management is implemented within the worker polling logic. Within Inngest, you can set multiple concurrency settings on a single function using one line of code. This creates virtual queues for managing runs.</li>
<li><strong>Read/write load</strong>. Handling tens of thousands of jobs per second leads to hundreds of thousands of requests per second: enqueues, "locks" (we'll get to that), dequeues all lead to heavy load on the backing infrastructure that runs the queue.</li>
<li><strong>Infrastructure</strong>. The queue needs to be reliable and fault-tolerant, which means we need distributed systems built in (which also impacts latency).</li>
<li><strong>Observability</strong>. Most queues are opaque, with little or basic observability out of the box. It's hard to build in real-time observability for step functions beyond the backlog: eg. number of functions waiting for other events, or a histogram of wall time vs execution time.</li>
<li><strong>Customizability</strong>. It's difficult and incredibly time intensive to extend basic queueing systems with advanced functionality. Customizations include: changing backoffs function-by-function, cancelling the backlog based off of job data, batching, debounce, smart indexing, and step function parallelism.</li>
</ul>
<p>To solve all of these problems, we developed a brand new queue from the ground up for Inngest. It's a fair, low-latency, multi-tenant queue which operates with multiple shared-nothing workers that claim jobs in an (almost) contention-free way.</p>
<p>In this series of blog posts, we'll explain how the queueing system works and the design decisions that solve these problems.</p>
<h2 id="how-reliability-layers-use-queues">How reliability layers use queues</h2>
<p>To set context, let's walk through how Inngest uses a queue, with an example function configuration using our <a href="https://www.inngest.com/docs/reference/typescript">TS SDK</a> (<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/inngest/inngestgo">Go</a> and <a href="https://www.inngest.com/docs/reference/python">Python</a> SDKs are also available, with <a href="https://roadmap.inngest.com/roadmap">more coming soon</a>):</p>

<p>If you're familiar with step functions, you probably already see what's happening here.  This code creates a function which runs automatically when the <code>clerk/user.created</code> event is received via Clerk's webhooks.  It's a step function which uses <a href="https://www.inngest.com/blog/how-durable-workflow-engines-work">durable execution</a> to reliably run code.  This means that each step is a code-level transaction backed by its own job in the queue.  If the step fails, it retries automatically.  Any data returned from the step is automatically captured into the function run's state and injected on each step call.</p>
<p>There are a few extra nuances.  The function specifies its own concurrency limits along with a debounce.  Concurrency limits prevent any more than 15 steps running at any one time.  The debounce schedules a function run for 5 seconds, and if any other matching events are received during that period, Inngest reschedules the function to run after another 5 seconds (until the maximum timeout has passed).</p>
<p>All of this happens automatically, without provisioning queues or infrastructure, based off of our queueing system.  Here's what happens:</p>
<ul>
<li>When an event is received, we <em><a href="https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/handling-idempotency">idempotently</a></em> enqueue a job which calls the function handler. This has to be idempotent, as <a href="https://www.inngest.com/blog/message-bus-vs-queues">event streams are <em>at least once</em></a>, and we want a single function run for one event.</li>
<li>Debounce complicates running functions: the job is scheduled with a 5 second delay (or whatever's in the function config), and any additional events delay the job again.</li>
<li>When the job becomes "visible", we ensure functions aren't beyond their concurrency limits and begin work by calling the function with the incoming event data.</li>
<li>Once a function runs a step, we store the step's result inside the function run's state and (worst case) enqueue <em>another</em> job to for the next step. There's some nuance here for long-running servers, though we'll talk about that in an execution deep dive separately.</li>
</ul>
<p>Essentially, <em>everything</em> impacts the queue. Running a function reliably has to use a queue. Concurrency, debounce, and batching all have an impact how the queue works at an individual job level.</p>
<p>With that context, let's talk about how this works in a multi-tenant environment, with thousands of users running millions of functions at the same time.</p>
<h2 id="unfairness-in-classic-queues">Unfairness in classic queues</h2>
<p>Most queues are <strong>not</strong> multi-tenant.</p>
<p>Take SQS. Typically, you'll create a queue to handle a specific job in your code.  That queue is used across every user in your system.  If one of your users (say, Mallory) sends 5,000 messages at once and then Alice enqueues something, we have to work through Mallory's 5,000 jobs before we can handle Alice's single task.  That's <em>unfair</em>.</p>
<p>With classic queueing systems, this is almost impossible to easily solve.  Randomly sharding amongst several queues will lower the chance that blocking happens, but it's guaranteed that eventually it happens anyway.   You could try do some bookkeeping yourself <em>outside</em> of the queue and manually requeue jobs as they come in, but that increases latency, costs, churn, and doesn't provide actual fairness (along with being hard, buggy, and annoying to write).</p>
<p>In short, it's <em>really hard</em> to make something like SQS, BullMQ, or Graphile work well in a multi-tenant environment.  Hacking around fairness costs a lot, increases latency, and without <em>very complex infrastructure</em> to provision items for each tenant doesn't actually solve the problem.</p>
<p>So, how do we solve fairness?</p>
<h2 id="building-a-fair-multi-tenant-queue">Building a fair multi-tenant queue</h2>
<p>In an ideal world, fairness happens at both a function level <em>and</em> an account level.  Let's say you have 100 functions running via Inngest, and you push a million jobs to a specific function.  These jobs should <em>not</em> block other functions in your account from running.</p>
<p><strong>This leads to the first requirement:  each function you add must get its own queue to maximize fairness.</strong></p>
<p>This raises a few questions.  How can we make queues cheap enough to create for every function, across every branch of your code?  And, how do workers subscribe to queues created at any point in time, without requiring restarts or new processes?  Almost every queue that exists today needs you to run workers that subscribe to specific queues:</p>
<pre language="ts" code="// ❌ classic queue workers aren't compatible with multi-tenant queues,
// or > 1 custom concurrency limits per function
worker.concurrency = 100;
worker.run([&quot;queue:1&quot;, &quot;queue:2&quot;], () => {
  // run jobs in queue 1 and 2
})
"><p>ts</p><div><p><span>// ❌ classic queue workers aren't compatible with multi-tenant queues,</span></p><p><span>// or &gt; 1 custom concurrency limits per function</span></p><p><span>worker</span><span>.concurrency </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>100</span><span>;</span></p><p><span>worker</span><span>.run</span><span>([</span><span>"queue:1"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"queue:2"</span><span>]</span><span>,</span><span> () </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span></p><p><span>  </span><span>// run jobs in queue 1 and 2</span></p><p><span>})</span></p></div></pre>
<p>If you add a new function to Inngest, we can't recreate workers on the fly.  It makes our code and infrastructure <em>far</em> too messy, and at worst could mean that workers cycle every second as new functions are added.</p>
<p><strong>We have another requirement: latency must be as low as possible.</strong></p>
<p>This adds a few more needs to the system.  We must have a pool of workers that auto-scale to make sure we're running jobs as fast as possible.  We can't reboot workers any time new queues are added.</p>
<p>Taking all of these requirements into account, we need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write workers which automatically discover available functions</li>
<li>Have workers automatically take work from each function</li>
<li>And do this <em>without contention</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Our third requirement: handling contention.</strong></p>
<p>Contention is another key part to fairness:  two workers shouldn't compete for the same function.  But, at the same time, we can't assign functions to <em>specific</em> workers, because they might die at any time.  The solution is to create a tiered queuing system.</p>
<ol>
<li>Each function gets its own queue of outstanding work.</li>
<li>We create <em>another</em> higher level queue, which records each function's earliest available job.</li>
<li>All workers scan this queue to discover available work.</li>
</ol>
<p>This gives us a subset of work that's available: <code>[Function A, Function B, Function C]</code> and so on, ordered by <em>latency</em> with the oldest job first.  This solves <em>multi-tenancy</em>, but even with this list we still have fairness and contention to deal with.  100 separate workers scanning for jobs will all get the same list in the same order, leading to 100 workers trying to run jobs for function A.  This is both unfair and high contention.</p>
<p>There are a few strategies we use to solve this.  One key part is that each worker priority shuffles the peeked jobs into a weighted random order, taking into account latency, capacity, free vs paid, etc.  Once shuffled, the worker claims the function's job queue to run work.  This ensures that every function runs independently and guarantees fairness.  It also minimizes latency, as priority shuffling still prioritizes older work.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>There's a ton more nuance to the queue, though at a high level this solves all key requirements:  contention, fairness, and latency.  A huge benefit to this model:  queues become incredibly cheap.  It's the magic that lets you create queues for each function, and it's <em>part</em> of the magic that lets us create virtual queues to add multiple concurrency levels to each function. This approach has allows us to create a queue with built-in flow control features to all users in a way that is reliable, performant, and scalable. We're <em>really</em> happy with this solution, and think it has a lot of legs.</p>
<p>Even though queues are fundamental to how we work, we think that reliability layers like Inngest mean that you never actually need to implement queueing, or even think about how it works.  The system abstracts everything for you declaratively by code, so even the freshest of engineers can productively build reliable systems.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After decades of good news in the fight against <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/hpv-can-cause-cancer-many-people-dont-realize-rcna79597" target="_blank">cervical cancer </a>— marked by decades of steady declines in cases and deaths — a new report suggests that some women are being left behind.</p><p>Thanks to early detection and treatment, rates of cervical cancer have plummeted by more than half over the past 50 years. Rates are falling fastest among women in their early 20s, the first generation to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/hpv-vaccine-protecting-even-young-women-who-haven-t-been-n1262202" target="_blank">benefit from HPV vaccines</a>, which were approved in 2006.&nbsp;</p><p>HPV, the human papillomavirus,<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/infectious-agents/hpv-and-cancer#:~:text=HPV%20can%20cause%20six%20types,and%20cases%20of%20genital%20warts." target="_blank"> causes six types of cancer</a>, including cervical cancer.&nbsp;</p><p>Among women aged 20 to 24, cervical cancer incidence dropped by 65% from 2012 to 2019, according to a<a href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/caac.21820" target="_blank"> report released Wednesday</a> from the American Cancer Society.</p><p>“Cervical cancer is one of the best-understood cancers,” said Dr. Nicolas Wentzensen, a senior investigator in the National Cancer Institute’s clinical genetics branch, who was not involved in the new report. “We’ve made amazing progress and it remains a success story.”</p><p>Not all women are benefitting from that progress, however.</p><p>The overall cervical cancer rate among women of all ages has stopped falling.</p><h2>Too old for HPV vaccination?</h2><p>Among women in their 30s and early 40s, incidence has been edging upward. Diagnosis of cervical cancer among women ages 30 to 44 rose almost 2% a year from 2012 to 2019.</p><p>“We need to make sure we are not forgetting about that generation that was a little too old for HPV vaccination,” said Jennifer Spencer, an assistant professor at the Dell Medical School at University of Texas-Austin who studies population health.</p><p>Fortunately, the cancers found in 30- and 40-something women were mostly early, curable tumors, said Ahmedin Jemal, senior author of the new report and the cancer society’s senior vice president for surveillance and health equity science. About 13,800 American women are diagnosed with cervical cancer each year and 4,360 die from the disease.</p><p>Researchers didn’t delve into the reasons why cervical cancer is becoming more common for some women, Jemal said.</p><p>But screening rates may play a role, said Spencer, who was not involved in the study. Screenings allow doctors to find and remove precancerous lesions before they become cancerous. More than half of women diagnosed with cervical cancer have either<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns/cervical-cancer/index.html#:~:text=More%20than%2050%25%20of%20all,doctor%20and%20had%20health%20insurance." target="_blank"> never been screened</a> or haven’t been screened in the past five years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 	</p><p>Studies show that fewer women are keeping up with routine cervical cancer exams.</p><p>The number of women ages 21 to 65<a href="https://progressreport.cancer.gov/detection/cervical_cancer" target="_blank"> who have been screened</a> according to the latest guidelines fell from 87% in 2000 to 72%, according to the National Cancer Institute.</p><p>Other research<a href="https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(23)00202-7/fulltext" target="_blank"> has found</a> that women ages 21 to 29 were the least likely to be up to date on their screenings, with 29% being overdue. Women were also more likely to be behind schedule if they were nonwhite, uninsured, lived in rural areas or identified as gay, lesbian or bisexual, according to the study.</p><p>The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force<a href="https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/cervical-cancer-screening" target="_blank"> recommends</a> screening women ages 21-29 with Pap smears — which examine cells under a microscope — every three years. Women ages 30 to 65 can be screened either every three years with a Pap smear or every five years with an HPV test or combination of the two tests. HPV tests can detect genetic material from the human papilloma virus.</p><p>Spencer said it’s possible that low screening rates among 20-something women could help explain the slightly higher cervical cancer rates among women in their 30s and early 40s.</p><p>When women in one of Spencer’s studies were asked why they hadn’t been screened recently, they commonly said that they <a href="https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(23)00202-7/fulltext" target="_blank">didn’t know they needed</a> to be screened or that a health provider hadn’t recommended it. Only 1% women ages 21 to 29 said they had skipped screening because they had received the HPV shot.</p><p>“Clearly, more patient education is needed,” said Dr. Betty Suh-Burgmann, chair of gynecologic oncology for Kaiser Permanente Northern California. Her health care system already reminds women about screenings by postcards, letters and phone calls. This year, Kaiser Permanente will begin texting patients, as well, she said.</p><p>Changing guidelines about cervical cancer screening also may have left women and health providers confused, Spencer said. Until the early 2000s, most doctors screened women annually. The task force has updated its guidelines three times in the past two decades, and is in the process of reviewing them again.</p><p>Others say the increase in cervical cancer rates among 30- and 40-something women isn’t so easily explained.</p><p>Cervical tumors<a href="https://cancer.ca/en/cancer-information/cancer-types/cervical/what-is-cervical-cancer/precancerous-conditions#:~:text=These%20conditions%20are%20not%20yet,can%20happen%20in%20less%20time." target="_blank"> &nbsp;tend to grow slowly,</a> typically taking a decade or more to morph from precancers to cancers, Wentzensen said. He said there may be other factors at play. For example, he wonders if more women moving to the United States haven’t been screened, putting them at higher risk.</p><p>And Spencer notes that screening is just the first step to saving lives. Women with abnormal screening results need to undergo additional testing and, if necessary, treatment.</p><p>In a<a href="https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(23)00202-7/fulltext" target="_blank"> study published last year</a> in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, Spencer and her colleagues found that only 73% of women with abnormal screening results received follow-up care.</p><p>“The onus is on the health care system to think about who is slipping through the cracks,” Spencer said.</p></div><div data-activity-map="expanded-byline-article-bottom"><p><span data-testid="byline-thumbnail"></span><span data-testid="byline-name">Liz Szabo</span><span></span></p><p>Liz Szabo is an independent health and science journalist.

<p>Sometimes, a great song can come from great pain. The Game Boy Advance (GBA), its software having crashed nearly two hours ago, will, for example, play a tune based on the game inside it. And if you listen closely enough—using specialty hardware and code—you can tell exactly what game it was singing about. And then theoretically play that same game.</p>
<p>This was discovered recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheZZAZZGlitch">by TheZZAZZGlitch</a>, whose job is to "sadistically glitch and hack the crap out of Pokémon games. It's "hardly a ready-to-use solution," the modder notes, as it requires a lot of tuning specific to different source formats. So while there are certainly easier ways to get GBA data from a cartridge, none make you feel quite so much like an audio datamancer.</p>
<figure><p><iframe type="text/html" width="980" height="550" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0-7PSmYYHF0?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption><p>TheZZAZZGlitch's demonstration of re-creating Game Boy Advance ROM data using the sounds from a crashing system.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>After crashing a GBA and recording it over four hours, the modder saw some telltale waveforms in a sound file at about the 1-hour, 50-minute mark. Later in the sound-out, you can hear the actual instrument sounds and audio samples the game contains, played in sequence. Otherwise, it's 8-bit data at 13,100 Hz, and at times, it sounds <a href="https://youtu.be/0-7PSmYYHF0?si=Vi36MhaFJxsIKTUZ&amp;t=44">absolutely deranged</a>.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>"2 days of bugfixing later," the modder had a Python script ready that could read the audio from a clean recording of the GBA's crash dump. Did it work? Not without more troubleshooting. One issue with audio-casting ROM data is that there are large sections of 0-byte data in the ROM, which are hard to parse as mute sounds. After running another script that realigned&nbsp;sections based on their location in the original ROM, the modder's ROM was 99.76 percent accurate but "still didn't boot tho." TheZZAZZGlitch later disclaimed that, yes, this is technically using known ROM data to surface unknown data, or "cheating," but there are assumptions and guesses one could make if you were truly doing this blind.</p>
<p>The next fix was to refine the sound recording. By recording three times and merging them with a "majority vote" algorithm, their accuracy notched up to 99.979 percent. That output ROM booted—but with glitched text and a title screen crash. After seven different recordings are meshed and filtered for blank spaces, they achieve 100 percent parity. That's about the halfway point of the video; you should watch the rest to learn how it works on physical hardware, how it works with a different game (an ARM code mystery in a replica cartridge), and how to get the best recordings, including the use of a "cursed adapter" that mixes down to one channel the ugly way.</p>

<h2 id="the-best-optimization-is-simply-shutting-things-off">The best optimization is simply shutting things off</h2>
<p>You work from 8am to 8pm. That’s 12 hours. What happened to the rest of the day? You go home. So you shut things down. That’s 50% cost saving right there.</p>
<p>Simple enough right?</p>
<p>Now add the following constraints:</p>
<ul>
<li>Imagine if you have an AWS organization with hundreds of workload accounts. I’ve seen org with over 700 accounts.</li>
<li>Imagine if you want to support resources other than EC2.</li>
<li>Now add Kubernetes to the mix. Now your EC2 VM is being controlled by autoscaling group/cluster autoscaler or karpenter. You can’t simply shut those off. They will be spin up right back.</li>
<li>Your team is small. You cant have them support all the teams within organization. You need a solution that can be dynamic (to support multiple resources, different requirements from different teams,etc..) but also easy enough for other team to operate it themselves.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cloud-automation-platform">Cloud Automation Platform</h2>
<p>I was thinking a bigger picture. I want a simple way to automate the whole cloud platform:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automate shutting down resources during off-work hours.</li>
<li>Discover certain event, correcting things</li>
<li>Etc…</li>
</ul>
<p>I like Lambda, Step Functions and EventBridge. Let’s build something out of those.</p>
<p>Here’s what I had in mind initially</p>
<p><img src="https://tuananh.net/img/cloud-automation.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We changed the design a little bit by instead of assuming role, we just publish an event to the spoke account eventbus. We didn’t want the automation executor to have abilties to assume role everywhere in the org.</p>
<p>With this system in placed, we can do lots of stuff like</p>
<ul>
<li>Whenever an EKS cluster is created within our org, we want to inject some security baseline policies in.</li>
<li>Whenever a Cloudwatch logs group created, we check for certain tag and if one presented, we ship it to a centralized account.</li>
<li>Or we can do stuff like auto-shutdown resources like we want initially at the beginning of the post.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-deployment">The deployment</h2>
<p>Now for this to work, we need to have:</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) a consistent way of deploying stuff into spoke accounts.</li>
<li>(2) We also need a way to protect those resources (this one is actually easy, we can use tag.)</li>
</ul>
<p>As for (1), we are currently using <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/aft-overview.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AWS AFT</a>
. They have a mechanism for us to define baseline.</p>
<p>Baseline is whatever resources you want to deploy to every accounts within an Organization Unit. Sounds exactly like what we need right.</p>
<p>This kind of “baseline” is kinda like our agents, embeded in every spoke account.</p>
<p>The rest of this is just</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) agent discover stuff, send event to controlplane.</li>
<li>(2) controlplane send command back to spoke account to act accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<p>We built all these with Lambda, Step Functions and EventBridge.</p>
<p>We love EventBridge pattern matching so much we created a small, <a href="https://github.com/tuananh/py-event-ruler" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tiny Python module to be able to test pattern matching locally</a>
.</p>
<h2 id="back-to-the-cloud-cost-optimization-problem">Back to the cloud cost optimization problem</h2>
<p>Now that we have a generic mechanism to automate stuff in our org. Let’s do some $$ saving.</p>
<p>For this specific case, we don’t need our embedded agent to send us anything. We can simply send the “shutdown” command from controlplane.</p>
<p>We have a little database for config customization if needed. This is a small Git repo where owners/operators of those spoke accounts can customize their schedule according to their need.</p>
<p>What they can config is a pattern (EventBridge pattern style) along with what kind resouces to apply and the action accordingly. We also populate some more properties into the pattern payload like</p>
<ul>
<li><code>is_holiday</code>: bool. This one is pre-evaluated with our national public holiday. Users can then use this in their pattern matching. Eg. if holiday, do not turn them on at 8am.</li>
<li><code>day_of_week</code>: Mon, Tue, etc… Users can then use this field to add a rule to turn things on at 8am from Mon to Fri.</li>
<li>and more …</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the agent receives the payload, they will act accordingly. For examples, EC2 will be send to a Lambda function that handle EC2 and RDS will be sent to another Lambda function that handle RDS.
It’s quite easy to add another resouce to the supported list by simply adding more Lambda function handler.</p>
<p>We make this feature an opt-out feature on our non-production OU (Organization Unit). If they want to turn this off for certain resources, they will have to tag those resources accordingly.</p>
<h2 id="the-result">The result</h2>
<p>Our compute (EC2, RDS, etc…) non-production costs reduce by over 70% during off-work hours. We projected to save approx ~150k USD during 1 year (assume that our cost will not grow). It’s a small piece of our cost but we are going to</p>
<p>There are certain workload that are a bit more complicated like Kubernetes I mentioned earlier. Those will be solved next in part 2 of this series. Stay tuned!</p>

The changes, set to begin rolling out in the coming weeks, aim to comply with the <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/eus-digital-markets-act-enters-into-force-on-november-1/">Digital Markets Act (DMA)</a>.</p>

<p>One key choice users will have is how information is shared between Facebook and Instagram. Instagram and Facebook users will be able to choose whether or not they want information shared between the apps. Those who currently have connected Instagram and Facebook accounts can opt to keep sharing data between the apps or separate their accounts.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Information use between Facebook and Instagram: People who have already chosen to connect their Instagram and Facebook accounts will be able to choose either:</p>

<ul>
<li>to continue to connect their accounts through our Accounts Center so that their information will be used across their Instagram and Facebook accounts; or</li>
	<li>to manage their Instagram and Facebook accounts separately so that their information is no longer used across accounts.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

            <p>Furthermore, Messenger is getting a standalone option. Users can continue using Messenger with their Facebook account or create a new account completely independent of Facebook. This new Messenger account will still offer core features like messaging, chat, and voice/video calls, but without Facebook.</p>

<p>For Facebook Marketplace, the options will be a personalized marketplace experience that taps into Facebook profiles or an anonymized experience where buyers and sellers only communicate via email instead of Messenger.</p>

<p>For gamers, Meta offers a similar choice to Facebook Gaming. Users can keep their Facebook info linked for access to features like multiplayer, in-game purchases, and personalized recommendations. Alternatively, they can opt for a Facebook-free gaming experience.</p>

<p>Finally,<a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/meta-confirms-plans-to-offer-ad-free-subscription-plans-for-facebook-and-instagram-in-europe/"> an option introduced in November 2023</a> remains relevant— European users can choose to pay a subscription to Facebook and Instagram ad-free. It ensures that their information is not used for targeted advertising.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>One evening in September of 1957, viewers across America could turn on their television sets and tune in to a CBS broadcast during which a young woman dropped acid. She sat next to a man in a suit: Sidney Cohen, the researcher who had given her the LSD. The woman wore lipstick and nail polish, and her eyes were shining. “I wish I could talk in Technicolor,” she said. And, at another point, “I can see the molecules. I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I’m part of it. Can’t you see it?” “I’m trying,” Cohen replied.</p><p>Were some families maybe—oh, I don’t know—eating meat loaf on TV trays as they watched this nice lady undergo her mind-bending, molecule-revealing journey through inner space? Did they switch to “Father Knows Best” or “The Perry Como Show” afterward? One of the feats that the historian Benjamin Breen pulls off in his lively and engrossing new book, “<a data-offer-url="https://www.amazon.com/Tripping-Utopia-Margaret-Troubled-Psychedelic/dp/1538722372/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Tripping-Utopia-Margaret-Troubled-Psychedelic/dp/1538722372/&quot;}" href="https://www.amazon.com/Tripping-Utopia-Margaret-Troubled-Psychedelic/dp/1538722372/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tripping on Utopia: Margaret Mead, the Cold War, and the Troubled Birth of Psychedelic Science</a>” (Grand Central), is to make a cultural moment like the anonymous woman’s televised trip seem less incongruous, if no less fascinating.</p><p>In Breen’s telling, the buttoned-down nineteen-fifties, not the freewheeling nineteen-sixties, brought together the ingredients, some of them toxic, for the first large-scale cultural experiment with consciousness-expanding substances. The psychedelic flowering of the sixties has, it turns out, a prequel—a rich and partly forgotten chapter before the hippie movement, before the shamanistic preening and posturing of <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/06/26/acid-redux">Timothy Leary</a>, and before the war on drugs shut all that down. This earlier history encompasses not only the now notorious C.I.A. research into mind-altering drugs but also a lighter, brighter, more public dimension of better living through chemistry, buoyed by postwar scientific optimism and public reverence for expertise. “Timothy Leary and the Baby Boomers did not usher in the first psychedelic era,” Breen writes. “They ended it.”</p><p>So the era we’re living in now is not the first in which LSD and other psychedelics were poised to enter the mainstream. In the twenty-twenties, psychedelics sit comfortably within politely au-courant circles of <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/wellness">wellness culture</a>, startup capitalism, and clinical research. Some Gen X-ers are as likely to try ayahuasca for a midlife crisis, or sub out their Lexapro for microdoses of LSD, as they might once have been to troop into the woods behind campus the day after finals with a few friends and a freezer bag full of shrivelled mushrooms. A number of recent studies have shown that psychedelics hold promise for treating depression, easing end-of-life anxiety, and helping people cope with grief. The best-selling 2018 book about this new science and its ramifications, “<a data-offer-url="https://www.amazon.com/Change-Your-Mind-Consciousness-Transcendence/dp/1594204225/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Change-Your-Mind-Consciousness-Transcendence/dp/1594204225/&quot;}" href="https://www.amazon.com/Change-Your-Mind-Consciousness-Transcendence/dp/1594204225/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">How to Change Your Mind</a>,” by Michael Pollan, has been so influential in piquing hopes for hallucinogens that scientific papers have identified what they call the Pollan Effect. (It describes the high expectations that some subjects bring to psychedelic studies, which can potentially influence how they report their experiences.) In 2019, Denver became the first U.S. city to decriminalize the use of psilocybin, the psychoactive compound in hallucinogenic mushrooms, and in 2020 Oregon became the first state to legalize it for use in therapy. Voters in several other localities, from Santa Cruz to Detroit to Washington, D.C., have since approved similar initiatives. This year, the F.D.A. will consider approving <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/books/under-review/the-rebranding-of-mdma">MDMA</a>, the drug many of us know in its street form as Ecstasy (and may still associate with raves), for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder. Even big pharmaceutical companies are looking to get in on the action.</p><p>The contemporary psychedelic movement shimmers, in other words, with next-big-thing energy, much of it centered less on freestyle tripping than on medicalized treatment. But Breen, a professor at U.C.&nbsp;Santa Cruz, whose previous book was on the history of the global drug trade, establishes that the feeling of déjà vu is real. We have been on this trip—or a version of it—before. For anyone who has closely followed the sinuous cultural, legal, and scientific saga of LSD, the outlines of its story will not come as a revelation. The C.I.A.’s MK-<em>ULTRA</em> program—which, headed by the chemist Sidney Gottlieb, conducted covert experiments into mind control via hypnosis and psychoactive drugs—has attracted many chroniclers since it first came to light, in the mid-seventies. (Recent examples include the investigative reporter Stephen Kinzer, in the 2019 book “<a data-offer-url="https://www.amazon.com/Poisoner-Chief-Sidney-Gottlieb-Control/dp/1250140439/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Poisoner-Chief-Sidney-Gottlieb-Control/dp/1250140439/&quot;}" href="https://www.amazon.com/Poisoner-Chief-Sidney-Gottlieb-Control/dp/1250140439/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Poisoner in Chief: Sidney Gottlieb and the CIA Search for Mind Control</a>,” and the documentarian <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-interview/the-world-is-of-course-insane-errol-morris-interview">Errol Morris</a>, with his eerie six-part Netflix series, “Wormwood,” about Frank Olson, a biowarfare scientist and C.I.A. employee who plunged to his death from a Manhattan hotel room in 1953, nine days after Gottlieb furtively dosed him with LSD.)</p><p>Breen extends this hall of mirrors, though. For one thing, he anoints the anthropologists Margaret Mead and her third husband, Gregory Bateson, as the book’s principals, a role he allows they would “likely have been surprised” by. (It’s true that they don’t turn up much in previous histories of psychedelics.) They belong here as spiritual guides, weaving in and out of a checkered story, Breen explains, owing to “their shared vision of science as a tool for expanding human consciousness.” Mead, for one, thought it was crucial that, as she wrote, we “reach an awareness which will give us a new control over our human destiny” and “learn consciously to create civilizations within which an increasing proportion of human beings will realize more of what they have it in them to be.”</p><figure><p><span><div data-attr-viewport-monitor=""><a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a27604&quot;}" href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a27604" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><picture></picture></a><p><span>“Should I wear my usual pants, or the same pants but newer?”</span></p><p><span>Cartoon by Colin Tom</span></p></div></span></p></figure><p>Her study of trance states, in Bali and elsewhere, was part of a long-standing interest in psychedelics. After conducting field work with the Omaha people in Nebraska in the nineteen-thirties, she wrote respectfully about their ritual use of peyote to promote social cohesion, foster enlightenment, and respond to social stresses. In the mid-fifties, by which time Mead was a well-known public intellectual, she was intrigued enough by LSD to observe its administration to a young volunteer in an MK-<em>ULTRA</em> lab experiment. Drugs such as LSD could be “integrative and insight-giving,” she wrote in a letter to a colleague, so long as they were pursued in “a responsible experimental spirit.” Mead told other colleagues that she planned to take LSD herself. What ultimately dissuaded her, Breen suspects, was the drug’s reputation as a truth serum. In 1955, five years after her marriage to Bateson dissolved, Mead would move in with her romantic partner Rhoda Métraux, an anthropologist. They lived together for the next twenty years. Mead had close relationships with C.I.A. and other government officials; she had a security clearance; she was a prominent and widely admired scientist. She must have worried, Breen argues, that she’d risk it all by letting slip an avowal of her bisexuality.</p><p>Bateson was an anthropologist who developed a specialty in systems theory and cybernetics, and he served in the O.S.S., the precursor of the C.I.A., during the Second World War. He mainly worked on propaganda missions in Burma, but his stint in the agency brought him into contact with intelligence figures who were interested in the military applications of mind-altering drugs. He and Mead remained in touch with these shadowy figures and with a broader circle of researchers who met regularly at influential conferences, sponsored by the Josiah Macy Jr. Foundation, on subjects such as neuroscience, cybernetics, hallucinogens, and the future. In 1959, Bateson set <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1968/08/17/paterfamilias-i">Allen Ginsberg</a> up on the poet’s first psychedelic trip, at a lab near Palo Alto. “It was astounding,” Ginsberg wrote home to his father, a schoolteacher in Paterson, New Jersey. “I lay back, listening to music, &amp; went into a sort of trance state&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and in a fantasy much like a Coleridge World of Kubla Khan saw a vision of that part of my consciousness which seemed to be permanent transcendent and identical with the origin of the universe—a sort of identity common to everything—but a clear &amp; coherent sight of it. Rather beautiful visual images also, of Hindu-type gods dancing on themselves.” Ginsberg urged his father, who was also a poet, to try it. Less successfully, Bateson worked for a time with the marine researcher (and inventor of the sensory-deprivation tank) John Lilly, who once administered LSD to dolphins. It’s a sad story: four of the seven dolphins subsequently died, or, as Lilly put it, delusively, “committed suicide” by “refusing to eat or breathe.”</p><p>Both Bateson and Mead had entanglements with the dark side of what Breen calls “the psychedelic Cold War.” They were personally and professionally close to top MK-<em>ULTRA</em> personnel. Still, they remain the most sympathetic figures in the book, thanks to their open-minded fascination with cultural differences, their fluid conceptions of gender and sexuality, and their dedication to facts. Timothy Leary would argue, for instance, that homosexuality was a pathology that LSD could “cure”; he claimed—oops—that it had cured Allen Ginsberg. By contrast, Mead, who was a generation older, appeared in 1961 on a nationally syndicated TV broadcast, “The Rejected,” where, Breen writes, she surrounded herself with New Guinean artifacts and “challenged the notion that homosexuality and transgender identities were ‘unnatural,’&nbsp;” rather than “part of the rich diversity of human potential.”</p><p>Bateson, for his part, dragged a heavy weight of family expectations around with him most of his life. He was one of three sons born to William Bateson, a prominent English biologist (he was the first to use the term “genetics” to describe the study of heredity), who wanted all three to make great scientific discoveries. But both of Bateson’s brothers died young—one in a hopeless infantry charge just a few weeks before the end of the First World War, and one by suicide four years later. As Breen tells it, Bateson’s preoccupation with attaining the scientific glory for which he and his brothers were destined led him down some blind alleys, including a misconceived family-dynamics theory of the etiology of schizophrenia and that unfortunate spell with Lilly. But Bateson could also be remarkably prescient. At an ultra-hip 1967 conference in London called “The Dialectics of Liberation”—it was attended by, among others, the Black Power leader Stokely Carmichael, the Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh, the anti-psychiatry crusader R.&nbsp;D. Laing, and Ginsberg—Bateson gave a speech about fossil-fuel-caused global warming, in what one historian thinks might have been the “first instance of climate change being discussed before a lay audience.” Bateson lamented that people were seeking “short cuts to wisdom” through LSD, but, given the environmental catastrophe we faced, he said, he could understand the impulse.</p><p>Breen has an eye for the telling detail, and a gift for introducing even walk-on characters with brio. One is George Hunter White, a former narcotics investigator from Pasadena who ran some of the real-world testing of LSD for the C.I.A., setting up bachelor pads in the West Village and in the Marina neighborhood of San Francisco where unsuspecting individuals could be surreptitiously dosed with the drug (in their drinks, food, or cigarettes) while agents observed and secretly recorded their behavior. Breen offers this quick, memorable sketch: “The 35-year-old White, who has been likened to ‘an extremely menacing bowling ball,’ had pale blue, Siberian husky eyes set in a gin-blossomed face, a boundless appetite for intoxicants, and a lifelong fascination with Chinese culture.”</p><p>One impression such portraits leave the reader with is that the nineteen-fifties and the early sixties were much weirder than you might imagine if you were still taking your cues from “The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet.” People who worked with psychedelics seem to have been especially adroit at projecting authoritative normality while conducting some very screwy and sometimes quite sinister business behind the scenes. Harold Abramson, a low-profile physician at Mt. Sinai Hospital, in New York, whose expertise was in allergies, led a life that was “outwardly conventional, a model of midcentury domesticity.” He and his wife, who had four children, “collected Japanese netsuke carvings, carefully cultivated the lawn of their palatial home in suburban Long Island, and he played bridge with their neighbors once a week.” But Abramson was also a chemical-weapons expert who fed LSD to the Siamese fighting fish he kept at his lab (as well as to willing guests at his dinner parties), and played a key role in the MK-<em>Ultra</em> program. Breen thinks he may have been the most influential researcher into psychedelics of the twentieth century.</p><p>And yet the late fifties and early sixties were also a kind of golden age for earnest, out-in-the-open exploration of psychedelics. Chemists at Sandoz Laboratories, in Basel, Switzerland, first synthesized an experimental compound known as lysergic acid diethylamide in 1938. By 1949, little bottles of the stuff were rolling off a Swiss assembly line, bound for labs and doctors’ offices around the world. (Officially, only licensed physicians who were engaged in research could get hold of it, but it didn’t take long for it to filter into other networks.) In a period before the development of modern antidepressants or, indeed, of many psychoactive drugs at all—boom times were on the way, starting with the first tranquillizers to come on the market, in the early sixties, but they hadn’t quite arrived yet—LSD seemed like a wonder drug, radiant with scientific promise. Aldous Huxley, in his 1954 memoir, “<a data-offer-url="https://www.amazon.com/Doors-Perception-Heaven-Hell/dp/0061729078/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Doors-Perception-Heaven-Hell/dp/0061729078/&quot;}" href="https://www.amazon.com/Doors-Perception-Heaven-Hell/dp/0061729078/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Doors of Perception</a>,” could compare psychedelics favorably to alcohol and barbiturates. “To most people,” Huxley wrote, mescaline “is almost completely innocuous.”</p><p>Psychedelics, for many who tried them, held not only the promise of fixing a clinical problem but of opening those doors of perception to some noumenal realm otherwise hidden to us. After taking a tiny amount of LSD, Huxley recalled that “what came through the closed door was the realization—not the knowledge, for this wasn’t verbal or abstract—but the direct, total awareness from the inside, so to say, of Love as the primary and fundamental cosmic fact.”</p><p>It was true that people sometimes freaked out, on trips that seemed to mire them in apocalyptic hellscapes. The dissolution of ego commonly experienced on acid—a sensation that the C.I.A. wanted to put to use for interrogation purposes—could be frightening. But people who experimented willingly with LSD often reported feelings of warm, oceanic well-being or images of incomparable, redemptive beauty. In 1959, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1975/07/14/cary-grant-profile-pauline-kael">Cary Grant</a> gave a series of interviews to a newspaper columnist in which he revealed that he had been transported by LSD. “All the sadness and vanities were torn away,” he said. “I was pleased by the hard core of strength I found inside me.” On his seventy-second trip, Grant, speaking into a dictaphone in the office of his Beverly Hills doctor, riffed on space flight and Hegelian dialectics: “Everything creates its opposite,” he said, “and therefore cyclicly itself.” (I like thinking of Grant, wearing an ascot, perhaps, intoning these dreamy revelations in clipped, patrician tones.)</p><p>Clare Boothe Luce, the former Republican congresswoman and ambassador, and the wife of the publishing tycoon <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/04/19/untimely-jill-lepore">Henry Luce</a>, became an LSD booster, turning to it many times for relief from depression and grief over her daughter’s death in a car accident. And she was quite the establishment figure: while tripping on acid for the first time, she had to refuse a phone call from Vice-President <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/richard-nixon">Richard Nixon</a>, who was seeking her political advice.</p><figure><p><span><div data-attr-viewport-monitor=""><a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a28457&quot;}" href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a28457" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><picture></picture></a><p><span>“The sugary cereal goes in the cart or this goes in the memoir.”</span></p><p><span>Cartoon by Suerynn Lee</span></p></div></span></p></figure><p>By the mid-sixties, though, LSD was taking on a new aura, gaining a groovy reputation as a pathway to utopia. The Pied Piper of that movement was Leary, who co-founded the Harvard Psilocybin Project in 1960. In a 1967 debate with the neuroscientist Jerome Lettvin, Leary declared that “the real goal of the scientist is to flip out.” LSD, cut loose from its medical moorings and ties to power, acquired a lasting association with hippie youth, which, in turn, made it more vulnerable to moral panics and political crackdowns. By the end of 1967, several states had banned psychedelics, and in 1970 Congress classified them as Schedule I drugs, connoting “no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.” In 1971, President Nixon declared a war on drugs—including heroin and marijuana, but also LSD, the substance that his old friend Clare Boothe Luce had taken and touted, and that medical authorities had once embraced as a psychiatric drug of great promise.</p><p>Does it matter for our present moment that psychedelics had a respectable, scientifically sanctioned past? Today, there is much enthusiastic media coverage about so-called classical psychedelics, such as LSD and psilocybin, and newer ones, such as MDMA, focussing on their specific mental-health applications—studies showing that they help some people with treatment-resistant depression and so on. Since they pose little risk of addiction, since depression and anxiety are on the rise, and since the pharmaceuticals we have at our disposal don’t work for everybody or sometimes cause unwelcome side effects, this focus makes sense. (More broadly, for many people now, psychedelics might evoke an association with wellness—the kind of purposeful, holistic hygiene a person might also pursue through silent retreats, mindful eating, or yoga.)</p><p>It’s worth remembering that LSD was never fully medicalized, not even in the late nineteen-fifties, the first heyday of legal and scientific psychedelics research. One important contributor to the field, the psychologist Betty Eisner, helped develop the idea that “set and setting” shaped the quality of psychedelic therapy. The emphasis she placed on soft lighting, comfortable furnishings, and the right music, customized for the individual, helped determine the protocols used today. (According to Ido Hartogsohn’s book, “<a data-offer-url="https://www.amazon.com/American-Trip-Psychedelic-Experience-Twentieth/dp/0262539144/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/American-Trip-Psychedelic-Experience-Twentieth/dp/0262539144/&quot;}" href="https://www.amazon.com/American-Trip-Psychedelic-Experience-Twentieth/dp/0262539144/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">American Trip</a>,” from 2020, Eisner found that Beethoven concertos were preferable to Gregorian chants, which often “evoked strong feelings of guilt.”) But Eisner’s own approach to psychedelic experiences became increasingly mystical. In 1964, she wrote to a colleague that she had become interested in “material” revealed on trips that seemed to “come from past lives and certain aspects of the patient which appear to come from outer space.”</p><p>In short, psychedelics have never been and will never be like other pharmaceuticals. “Although efforts to bring psychedelics to the market as FDA-approved psychiatric treatments are well underway, it is doubtful whether the category of ‘prescription drug’ will ever be able to contain them, because of their varied uses,” Breen observed in an essay for the Washington <em>Post</em> last year. Neither, though, are they likely to reëmerge as modern-day accessories to spiritual trance states, the sort of shamanistic practices in which, as Mead had written, “people take a great many precautions in selecting and ritually training those who will engage regularly in trance and in controlling where and under what circumstances trance may be induced.” Inasmuch as psychedelics generate both medical interventions and spiritual quests, and maybe other experiences as well, then, as Breen says, we may need new categories to accommodate them.</p><p>One of the striking motifs in Breen’s book is the optimism with which many of the scientists he writes about, including Mead, saw the future. Psychedelics were among the forces that they believed could heal cultural rifts and advance the evolution of civilizations. It’s hard to imagine replicating that kind of optimism today. We know far too much to trust in the purity of science, the transparency of government, the good will of pharmaceutical companies, or the power of individual enlightenment to melt cultural barriers and repair the world. But perhaps there’s hope in the kind of skepticism that can make us approach matters in smarter ways this time around.</p><p>Reading about the recent studies of LSD’s positive effects, for example, we know to be at least a little circumspect. Many of the studies involve a small number of subjects, who’ve been very tightly screened. It’s hard to keep such research double-blind, since people in the placebo arm of a hallucinogenic trial can often guess that they didn’t get the stuff that would have made them trip. A recent academic article by two psychologists at Leiden University, Michiel van Elk and Eiko&nbsp;L. Fried, identified no fewer than ten “pressing challenges” to the validity of current psychedelic studies—including conflicts of interest (especially since pharmaceutical companies have joined academic groups in conducting them), inadequate reporting of adverse events, small sample sizes, lack of long-term follow-up, and the difficulty of creating persuasive placebos. But van Elk and Fried are not raising these problems to try to shut down psychedelic research; they aim to improve its “rigor and credibility” with specific recommendations: “Our hope is that new studies may find credible evidence that psychedelic therapy can be a useful tool for specific groups of patients.”</p><p>In 1966, Sidney Cohen, Eisner’s colleague and the psychiatrist who had provided Luce with her LSD, expressed his worry that psychedelic research had gone astray: “We are seeing accidents happen. We are frightening the public. We are getting laws passed [banning the drug]. We are not using the anthropological approach of insinuating a valuable drug of this sort into our culture&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. gradually demonstrating the goodness of the thing.” Maybe we know enough now to proceed not with messianic hype but with testable hope, the kind that won’t risk a war-on-drugs backlash, or promise utopia, or put powerful hallucinogens into the hands of clandestine medical-ethics-flouting researchers, but that could still end up demonstrating the goodness of the thing.&nbsp;♦</p></div></div>]]></description>
