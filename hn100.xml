<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In 2022, I had an idea that could decrease the size of all newly-published npm packages by about 5%, and it was completely backwards compatible. This would have improved performance and reduced storage costs.</p><p>I eagerly pitched this idea to the npm maintainers, convinced it was a clear win. But after a few months, my proposal was rejected. To be clear: <em>I think this was the right call!</em></p><p>Here’s what happened. I hope this story will be useful to others.</p><h2 id="technical-background">Technical background</h2><p>Two things to know before diving in: how npm packages are distributed, and about the Zopfli compressor.</p><h3 id="npm-packages-are-just-gzipped-tarballs">npm packages are just gzipped tarballs</h3><p>First thing to know: npm packages are distributed as tar archives compressed with gzip. In other words, they’re just <code>.tar.gz</code> or <code>.tgz</code> files.</p><p>You can download these archives using <code>npm pack $PACKAGE_NAME</code>:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>npm pack express &amp;&amp; ls
</span></span><span><span><span># =&gt; express-4.21.2.tgz</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If you <a href="https://evanhahn.com/mnemonic-to-remember-tar-commands/">extract this tarball</a>, you’ll see all of the package’s files, such as <code>package.json</code>.</p><h3 id="zopfli-a-gzip-compatible-compressor">Zopfli, a gzip-compatible compressor</h3><p>The second thing to know about: <a href="https://github.com/google/zopfli">Zopfli</a>.</p><p>Zopfli can create gzip-compatible data that’s smaller than other tools can. For example, compare the <code>zopfli</code> command to the <code>gzip</code> command:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>gzip -9 romeo_and_juliet.txt
</span></span><span><span>du -h romeo_and_juliet.txt.gz
</span></span><span><span><span># =&gt; 64K     romeo_and_juliet.txt.gz</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>zopfli romeo_and_juliet.txt
</span></span><span><span>du -h romeo_and_juliet.txt.gz
</span></span><span><span><span># =&gt; 60K     romeo_and_juliet.txt.gz</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>As you can see, <code>zopfli</code> produces smaller files than <code>gzip</code>.</p><p>If Zopfli produces smaller sizes than gzip, why not use it everywhere? Unfortunately, Zopfli is great but it’s <em>much</em> slower than regular gzip.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>time gzip -9 romeo_and_juliet.txt
</span></span><span><span><span># =&gt; real   0m0.016s</span>

</span></span><span><span>time zopfli romeo_and_juliet.txt
</span></span><span><span><span># =&gt; real   0m0.462s</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this simple test, Zopfli is about <em>28 times slower</em>! That means it’s bad for content that changes a lot, but good for content that doesn’t.</p><p>In my opinion, Zopfli’s killer feature is that it creates files that are backwards compatible with existing decompressors. Other compression algorithms, like LZMA, can be better than gzip, but you can’t decompress their results with <code>gunzip</code> or equivalent. With Zopfli, you can!</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>cat my_file.txt
</span></span><span><span><span># =&gt; Hello world</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>lzma -c my_file.txt | gunzip -c
</span></span><span><span><span># =&gt; gunzip: unknown compression format</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>zopfli -c my_file.txt | gunzip -c
</span></span><span><span><span># =&gt; Hello world</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>So I wondered: if npm packages are compressed with gzip, <strong>could npm packages be compressed better with Zopfli?</strong> The answer is “yes”.</p><h2 id="proof-of-concept">Proof of concept</h2><p>To see if this would work, I tried it on one of my own npm packages.</p><p>I did something like this:</p><ol><li><p>Get the file that is published by default. I used <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/humanize-duration">HumanizeDuration.js</a>, one of my more popular packages, as a test.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>cd HumanizeDuration.js
</span></span><span><span>npm pack
</span></span><span><span><span># ...</span>
</span></span><span><span><span># =&gt; humanize-duration-3.32.1.tgz</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This created <code>humanize-duration-3.32.1.tgz</code>, which was ~17 kibibytes large. I could <code>npm publish</code> this right now, but let’s try shrinking it.</p></li><li><p>Decompress (but don’t unarchive) the file.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>gunzip humanize-duration-3.32.1.tgz
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This leaves us with an uncompressed tarball, <code>humanize-duration-3.32.1.tar</code>.</p></li><li><p>Re-compress it with Zopfli.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>zopfli humanize-duration-3.32.1.tar
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>As expected, this produced a slightly smaller file by over a kilobyte. That’s promising!</p></li><li><p>Make sure I could still install it.

</span></span><span><span>node -p <span>'require("humanize-duration")(1234)'</span>
</span></span><span><span><span># =&gt; 1.234 seconds</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>It worked!</p></li></ol><p>This saved 1114 bytes for a ~6.2% reduction. And this is completely backwards-compatible. That made sense; this is what Zopfli is supposed to do!</p><p>I also tried it on a few of my other packages. Everything seemed to work and offered a ~5% size reduction. Great!</p><p>I published one of my modules this way, and nobody complained. I later did this for <a href="https://helmetjs.github.io/">Helmet</a>, my <a href="https://evanhahn.com/lessons-learned-maintaining-a-sorta-popular-open-source-package/">most popular module</a>—again, without issue.</p><p>This was, and still is, a minor success. This is a small optimization that saves about 2 gigabytes of bandwidth per year across all installations. I doubt many individual installs were perceptibly faster after this change…but it’s nice to do a tiny amount of work for a 5% improvement!</p><p>Now that I’d proved it’d work for my modules, I wondered: <em>could this be done on a wider scale?</em></p><h2 id="2022-05-27-asking-for-feedback">2022-05-27: asking for feedback</h2><p>Given that this worked fine for my packages, could this be done for the <em>entire npm registry</em>?</p><p>On May 27, I asked my <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> colleagues for feedback on an idea. Here’s what I asked (reformatted slightly):</p><blockquote><p>Here is something I would like feedback on:</p><p>npm packages are just gzipped tarballs (try it yourself with <code>npm pack $PACKAGE_NAME</code>).</p><p>Zopfli does a better job at gzipping files than <code>gzip -9</code>.</p><p>Therefore, the npm registry and developers could save bandwidth if they compressed new (or re-compressed existing) packages with Zopfli.</p><p>With React as an example:</p><ul><li>The latest version of React is 81,166 bytes, compressed with the equivalent of <code>gzip -9</code></li><li>Re-compressing it with Zopfli saves 4019 bytes; about a 5% reduction</li><li>React was downloaded ~562M times last year</li><li>That would save ~2 TiB of bandwidth just for React</li></ul><p>To be clear, this is completely backwards compatible as far as I understand.</p></blockquote><p>I got two important pieces of feedback:</p><ul><li><a href="https://belkadan.com/about">Jordan Rose</a> pointed out that decompression time could be significant. I hadn’t checked this! I ran some quick tests and found that this wasn’t an issue.</li><li><a href="https://fosstodon.org/@indutny">Fedor Indutny</a> pointed out that npm’s lockfile, <code>package-lock.json</code>, contains a checksum of the package file. The npm people couldn’t easily re-compress existing packages without breaking things. It would only work for newly-published files; new packages or new versions of existing ones.</li></ul><p>Armed with that feedback, I brought the idea to the npm folks.</p><h2 id="2022-05-29-rfc-time">2022-05-29: RFC time</h2><p>I learned that the npm CLI people have <a href="#TODO">a formal proposal process</a> where you write up a document and submit a patch.</p><p>I spent a few days writing and editing my proposal, <a href="https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/595">“Improving tarball compression while maintaining backwards compatibility”</a>. It was 708 words. I tried to make it sound compelling with things like this:</p><blockquote><p>Even a small savings, like 5%, would reduce the registry’s bandwidth usage by multiple terabytes. For example: React&nbsp;<a href="https://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=react&amp;from=2021-01-01&amp;to=2021-12-31">was downloaded 561,743,096 times in 2021</a>. If we assume that each of these downloads shrunk from 81,166 bytes to 77,147 bytes, the registry would have saved more than 2 terabytes in bandwidth for React alone.</p></blockquote><p>On May 29, I finally submitted my RFC. I was nervous!</p><h2 id="2022-06-01-they-discussed-it">2022-06-01: they discussed it</h2><p>A few days later, the npm CLI people had <a href="https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/596">a meeting where they discussed a bunch of stuff, including my RFC</a>. I wasn’t able to attend but watched the recording. Overall, they felt it was worth evaluating further but were cautious. From their notes:</p><blockquote><p>Overall sentiment is that the compression improvement is welcome but it looks like it would take a proof of concept and challenge some of the edge cases to see if there are any unintended consequences, etc</p></blockquote><p>I built a <a href="https://evanhahn.github.io/npm-repack-with-zopfli-proof-of-concept/">little proof of concept web app</a> that used a WebAssembly port of Zopfli to recompress npm packages and <a href="https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/595#issuecomment-1145168973">posted about it on the RFC</a>.</p><p>I attended the next meeting a couple of weeks later.</p><h2 id="2022-06-15-the-meeting">2022-06-15: the meeting</h2><p>I attended a call on June 15.</p><p>I did the bad thing where I wasn’t really listening until it was my turn because I was thinking about what I was going to say. When it was finally my turn, I stammered.</p><p>Watching it back, I cringe a bit. I was wordy, unclear, and unconvincing. But I think I did an <em>okay</em> job making my point: npm packages could become ~5% smaller if we could figure out how to run Zopfli at publish time.</p><p>You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/l8ob4j_KOR4?t=853">watch my mumbling in the recording</a>, as well as the npm maintainers’ feedback.</p><p><em>“Who benefits from this?”</em> was probably the biggest question. It was discussed that the npm registry folks, paying storage costs, might care about this. But “literally no one’s noticed” some other recent performance improvements, so they wanted to see more data. Was this just something I thought was neat (a “performance romantic”, as one person called it), or did this solve a real problem for users?</p><p>There were also concerns about including WebAssembly, the performance implications at install time, and Zopfli licensing issues.</p><p>I was tasked with some investigation on the topics above, and I got digging.</p><h2 id="2022-07-31-giving-up">2022-07-31: giving up</h2><p>After a bunch of thinking and feedback, what once seemed like an obviously great idea now seemed…well, less great.</p><p>On July 31, after doing a bunch of research, I posted <a href="https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/595#issuecomment-1200480148">a comment on the RFC</a>.</p><p>I wrote up some pros and cons.

<p><em>Pieter-Tjerk de Boer, PA3FWM <a href="mailto:web@pa3fwm.nl">web@pa3fwm.nl</a></em></p><p>
(This is an adapted version of an article I wrote for the Dutch
amateur radio magazine <em>Electron</em>, November 2021.)
</p><p>

<img src="https://www.pa3fwm.nl/technotes/tn28fig1.jpg" alt="Oliver Heaviside">

An antenna cable is not just a piece of wire.
Technically, it's called a "transmission line",
with special properties such as its characteristic impedance.
But transmission lines are quite a bit older than radio technology: they date back to the
second half of the 19th century, in the form of (mostly submarine) telegraph cables.
In this article we look at the principles and properties of transmission lines,
with special emphasis on Oliver Heaviside's contribution to our knowledge of them.

</p><h2>Oliver Heaviside</h2><p>

After secondary school, Oliver Heaviside (1850-1925) started working at the company
which operated the submarine telegraph cable between Newcastle (UK) and Denmark.
At first he worked as a telegraph operator, but soon he also got involved with the
(electro)technical side of the telegraph systems.
One of the things he noticed, was that when water leaked into a submarine cable and
progressively short-circuited it, the signals did not just become weaker (as expected),
but also clearer, less distorted.

</p><p>
In those days, electrical engineering was still in its infancy.
Thanks to the work of physicists like Volta, Ampère, Ørsted and Faraday, there was a decent
understanding of generating electrical currents and moving compass needles using an electromagnet.
Together, that is enough for building a telegraph, at least in principle.
But if one uses as very long cable, and tries to send dots and dashes at a high rate,
it turned out to not work so well.
There was little theoretical understanding of this,
particularly among the more practically minded people who cobbled together telegraph systems.

</p><p>
Heaviside studied physics by himself, and stumbled on the books by James Clerk Maxwell.
Maxwell's ideas about electromagnetism were, at that time, rather speculative and not widely accepted,
but Heaviside got enthousiastic, studied them, and succesfully applied this theory to telegraph lines.

</p><p>
Thus, Heaviside, who never had studied at a university, rose from being a humble telegraph operator
to a respected physicist.
After quitting his job at the telegraph company at the age of 24, he never had another job.
The rest of his life he lived in relative poverty while working on the theory.
He became one of the so-called Maxwellians: a group of physicists who enhanced Maxwell's
theory after his untimely death (in 1879 at the age of 48) and popularised it.
One of Heaviside's achievements is that he converted Maxwell's twenty mathematical formulas
into a more accessible set of just four, which nowadays are taught at all universities
as "Maxwell's equations".
If you want to learn more about this remarkable person, I recommend his biography [1].

</p><h2>Thomson's model</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.pa3fwm.nl/technotes/tn28fig2.png" alt="Thomson's model">

William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) 
attempted to describe what happens in a long telegraph cable.
His model is sketched in the figure.
He mentally chopped the cable into short pieces, each of which has some resistance and some capacitance.
Next, he calculated what happens if at the left end one suddenly applies a voltage of say 1 volt.
The graphs show the result, for a 4 km long cable having 0.1 ohm of resistance per meter,
and 10 pF of capacitance per meter.
The cable has been divided into 4 pieces of 1 km each, so each having 100 ohm and 10 nF.
We see that the voltage on the first capacitor gradually increases to 1 volt: that's logical,
as the capacitor gets charged via the first resistor.
The voltage on the second capacitor also gradually increases to 1 volt, but slower:
that makes sense, as it is charged from the first capacitor.
And so on.
At the right end of the cable, the voltage increases only very gradually,
and this slow increases puts a limit on how quickly Morse code signs can be sent.

</p><p>
However, Thomson's model is wrong.


</p><h2>Heaviside's model</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.pa3fwm.nl/technotes/tn28fig3.png" alt="Heaviside's model">

Heaviside realised that the inductance of the cable is also important.
See the next figure: here we have replaced Thomson's resistors by inductors, of 1 µH per meter of cable length.

</p><p>
First have a look at the first set of graphs, marked as "4 sections".
We see that the voltage on the first capacitor reaches the full 1 volt much earlier
than in Thomson's model, and even overshoots.
This is because once there is current flowing in an inductor, this current doesn't
just stop when the voltage across the coil becomes lower.
This faster increase of the voltage, and the fact that the current doesn't just stop,
also causes the second capacitor to be charged earlier and faster than in Thomson's model,
and so on.

</p><p>
Of course, modelling a 4 km long cable in just 4 pieces is not very realistic.
For a better model, we could e.g. model it using 10 times as many pieces,
each 10 times shorter (i.e., 40 pieces of 100 m each),
each with 10 times less capacitance and inductance.
The result is shown in the second set of graphs.
The third set of graphs is for a yet 10 times finer modelling of the cable.
The graphs now show the voltage at every 10th and every 100th capacitor, respectively;
i.e., still at distances of 1, 2, 3 and 4 km from the start of the cable,
like in the first set of graphs.
We see that with the more refined model, the voltages increase faster and the overshoot takes less long.

</p><p>
The schematic with all those coils and capacitors resembles a low-pass filter,
and indeed, we see that the voltages increase only gradually,
hinting at the absence of high frequencies.
When one partitions the model in ever smaller pieces, the inductances and capacitances
become smaller and the filter's cut-off frequency becomes higher.
If one mathematically takes the limit, eventually modelling the cable as consisting
of infinitely many pieces, each having infinitely little inductance and capacitance,
one gets an ever more accurate model.
While doing so, the low-pass effect disappears, and the voltage jump from 0 to 1 volt
is transmitted without distortion.



</p><h2>Impedance</h2><p>

Heaviside's model also helps us to understand what the "impedance" of a cable is.
At the left, suddenly a voltage of 1 volt is applied to the cable.
The capacitors are as yet uncharged, so there's 1 volt across the first inductor,
causing a gradually increasing current to flow.
How large will that current become?
That depends on the inductance: the more inductance, the slower the current increases.
And it also depends on the capacitance: the more capacitance, the more charge needs to be supplied
to charge it to 1 volt.
When the capacitor has been charged to 1 volt (ignoring the overshoot),
there will be 0 volts across the inductor, so the current through it will no longer change.
The current doesn't become 0, but remains constant, flows into the second inductor,
charges the second capacitor, and so on.

</p><p>
And what happens when also the last capacitor has been charged?
As noted above, the current through those inductors cannot just stop.
If we "terminate" the cable in a resistor, as shown in the figure, then the
current will flow through the resistor and cause a voltage drop across it.
If the resistor has exactly the right value, then that voltage drop is exactly 1 volt.
Then we reach a stable state: all capacitors are charged to 1 volt, across the coils
there's no voltage, and a constant current flows from the source through the cable
and the termination resistor.

</p><p>
If the termination resistor is too large, the voltage drop across it will be more than 1 volt,
so the last capacitor will be charged to more than 1 volt.
Via the last inductor a part of that charge will then flow back from the last to the
second-to-last capacitor, from there to the third-last capacitor, and so on:
we get a <i>reflected</i> wave.
Something similar happens if the termination resistor is too small.

</p><p>
The value of the termination resistor which does <i>not</i> cause a reflection,
is called the impedance of the cable.
It turns out that this equals <math><msqrt><mi><i>L/C</i></mi></msqrt></math>,
where <i>L</i> and <i>C</i> are the inductance and capacitance per meter of cable length.
Note that this formula matches what we already observed earlier: more <i>L</i> means less current
and thus higher termination resistor needed to still drop 1 volt;
similarly, more <i>C</i> means more current and thus lower termination resistor.


</p><h2>Speed</h2><p>

In the previous figure, we effectively saw a <i>wave</i> move from left to right through the cable;
the farther from the source, the later the voltage change arrives.
How fast does this wave move?
That also depends on the values of <i>L</i> and <i>C</i>.
The larger the inductance <i>L</i>, the slower the current increases (at given voltage),
so the longer it takes to charge the next capacitor.
And the larger <i>C</i>, the longer it takes (at given current) to charge the capacitance.
Heaviside showed that the speed equals </p><mathml>1/<msqrt><mi><i>LC</i></mi></msqrt>.

<p>
Does this mean that we can make a cable with any desired speed,
simply by choosing <i>L</i> and <i>C</i> appropriately?
Perhaps even faster than light? (Einstein already starts turning over in his grave.)
No: it turns out that we have only limited freedom in choosing <i>L</i> and <i>C</i>.
Changing the shape and size of the cable affects both <i>L</i> and <i>C</i>, and always
such that the speed of light is never exceeded.

</p><p>
<img src="https://www.pa3fwm.nl/technotes/tn28fig4.png" alt="[properties of coaxial cable]">
As an example, consider a coaxial cable.
If one makes the center conductor thinner, the capacitance between center conductor and
shield decreases, so by the formula one would expect the speed to increase.
Unfortunately, at the same time the inductance increases!
That's (among others) because making the center conductor thinner causes the currents
inside that center conductor to be closer together, and thus sense more of each other's
magnetic field (which, after all, is what causes (self)-inductance).

<o>
The figure shows, for a coaxial cable with air as isolation,
the theorectical dependence of the capacitance and inductance (both per meter) on the ratio of the
diameters of the center conductor and the shield.
Furthermore, the resulting impedance and wave velocity are indicated.
The solid lines are based on the assumption that the current spreads itself equally
over the entire cross-section of the center conductor.
We see that in this case the velocity increases when the center conductor is made thinner,
but does not exceed the speed of light (300 × 10<sup>6</sup> m/s).
At higher frequencies the skin-effect kicks in, forcing the current to only flow on the outside
of the center conductor.
That case is indicated with dotted lines, and the speed exactly equals the speed of light,
regardless of the diameters.

</o></p><p>
If we fill the cable with e.g. some plastic material, the capacitance increases while the
inductance remains the same. Then the speed decreases; this is generally described
as the "velocity factor" being less than 1.

</p><h2>Loss and distortion</h2>
<img src="https://www.pa3fwm.nl/technotes/tn28fig5.png" alt="[Heaviside's model with loss]">

So far, we haven't included loss in the model, but a real cable does have loss due to resistances,
and Heaviside included this in his model, as sketched at the right.
There are two kinds of loss.
The first one is the resistance of the copper wire itself; to model this,
Heaviside included a resistance of <i>R</i> ohms per meter in series with each inductance.
The second one is the leakage of the capacitor's isolation, modelled as a parallel resistance 1/<i>G</i>.
(We write this as 1/<i>G</i> because this resistance is inversely proportional to the length;
the shorter the cable section, the less leakage, so the larger the leakage resistance.
Thus <i>G</i> itself, being the inverse of the resistance, is again directly proportional
to the length; it is expressed in Ω<sup>-1</sup> per meter, also called Siemens per meter.)

<p>
Heaviside showed that losses do not just attenuate the signal, but also cause distortion.
In fact we already saw this in Thomson's model in the first figure:
the sudden increase of the voltage at the input of the cable, is distorted to something
that only rises slowsly, as it travels down the cable.

</p><p>
However, Heaviside also found out that this distortion disappears if the following
condition is satisfied: <i>L</i>/<i>R</i> = <i>C</i>/<i>G</i>.
If there is no loss, then <i>R</i> and <i>G</i> are both 0, so the condition is satisfied.
But a realistic cable usually has <i>L</i>/<i>R</i>  much smaller than <i>C</i>/<i>G</i>,
because <i>G</i>, the leakage of the isolation, is almost zero (good isolation material),
and particularly in submarine cables, the capacitance is rather high.
In principle, we can improve such a cable in four ways to satisfy the condition:
</p><ul>
<li> decrease <i>R</i>: use thicker copper wire, that's expensive.
</li><li> decrease <i>C</i>, i.e., increase the distance between the wires: that may be feasible
on telegraph poles on land, but making a coaxial submarine cable thicker is hard (expensive).
</li><li> increase <i>G</i>, so use a not-so-good isolation material: this is what happens when
water seeps into a sea-cable (recall that Heaviside as a telegraph operator had already noticed that
then the distortion is reduced), but the obvious disadvantage is that the signals
become weaker.
</li><li> what remains: increase <i>L</i>.
</li></ul>

<img src="https://www.pa3fwm.nl/technotes/tn28fig6.jpg" alt="[a Pupin coil]">
Indeed, special cables have been manufactured in which the center conductor has extra
inductance, by covering it in a suitable magnetic material.
But the most commonly used way to increase <i>L</i>, is by connecting a coil in series
every couple of kilometers.
Heaviside invented this idea, but William Preece, the British telegraph service's 
engineer-in-chief didn't believe it, and in fact thought that one should avoid inductance.
As a consequence, the technique initially was not tried in England (and this was not the
only conflict between Heaviside and Preece [1]).
But Michael Pupin patented the idea a few years later in America.
It turned out to work very well and has been used for decades in the telephone industry,
until it became possible to amplify signals electronically.
And radio amateurs have, particularly in the 1970s and 1980s, used such Pupin coils
for making audio filters.
The picture shows a typical Pupin coil. It had two windings, with red and green wires,
for both wires of the telephone line. Separately the windings usually were 22 mH,
in series 88 mH.

<p>
Should we now also insert coils into our antenna cables to prevent distortion of our
radio signals?
No: firstly the distortion is negligible for relatively narrow-band signals;
and secondly, such coils would work as a low-pass filter, so our (high) frequencies
wouldn't get through anymore.

<p><span><span><span><span>Elbilernes salgskurve er de seneste år gået stejlt opad, og mere end hver anden solgte nye bil er nu en elbil. Det mærker man nu også ude i landets synshaller, hvor elbiler ikke længere er et særsyn. Lige Godt 28.000 elbiler var i de første 11 måneder af 2024 til periodisk syn. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Det er dog langtfra alle elbiler, der klarer turen på liften lige godt. Især én model falder igennem: Tesla Model 3. Den populære elbil, som der kører i alt 35.000 af på de danske veje, blev lanceret i 2019, og dermed har den første store årgang været til sit første periodiske bilsyn i det forgangne år.</span></span></span></span></p>





<h2><span><span><span><span>Rasende høj dumpeprocent</span></span></span></span></h2>

<p><span><span><span>Af de 4.668 Tesla Model 3 årgang 2020, som mellem 1. januar og 21. november sidste år var til syn, dumpede de 1.051. Det svarer til 23 procent. Til sammenligning dumpede ’kun’ 9 procent af de øvrige elbiler, der var til syn i 2024, viser tal fra Færdselsstyrelsen, som FDM Test &amp; Bilsyn har analyseret. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>– Det er en rasende høj dumpeprocent for Tesla Model 3, som Færdselsstyrelsens synsdata afslører, men det er desværre ikke noget, som overrasker os. Tallene indikerer, at kvaliteten og holdbarheden af Tesla Model 3, i hvert fald de første årgange, ikke er på niveau med andre bilmærker. Det er noget, vi også oplever, og som vi holder øje med, siger områdechef i FDMs tekniske rådgivning Lone Otto. </span></span></span></p>

<h2>Tesla har mere end hver 3. af alle fejl</h2>

<p><span><span><span>I</span></span></span><span><span><span>&nbsp;alt blev der fundet 1.392 fejl på de Tesla Model 3 årgang 2020, svarende til 0,3 fejl pr. synet model. Dermed blev der fundet tre gange så mange fejl i forhold til de øvrige elbiler, som blev synet sidste år. </span></span></span></p>



<p><span><span><span><span>Billedet fra de danske synshaller af Tesla Model 3 stemmer overens med synstal fra Tyskland. Også her faldt bilmodellen igennem i den årlige synsrapport fra tyske TÜV, der bl.a. syner biler. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Det er særligt fejlgrupperne „bremseudstyr“, „lygteudstyr“, „aksler, hjul og dæk“ samt „styretøj“, som bilerne dumper på. Noget man i FDMs tekniske rådgivning kan nikke genkendende til. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>– Elbiler bremser på en anden måde, og derfor er problemer med bremserne velkendt. Men det er kritisk, at problemer med hjulophæng og ratslør er så udtalt på en bil, der ikke er ældre end Tesla Model 3. Det ser vi ikke på andre biler. Det samme gælder Teslas overrepræsentation af fejl på lygter, som ofte enten er løse, eller som blænder, siger Lone Otto</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>– Vi har ingen grund til at tro, at yngre årgange af Tesla Model 3 vil adskille sig væsentligt fra årgang 2020, når det gælder fejl og dermed også dumpeprocent. Mere spændende bliver det at se, hvordan Tesla Model Y vil klare sig, siger Lone Otto og tilføjer:</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>– Tesla har fire års garanti på sine biler. Det passer med deres første syn. Et godt råd er derfor at få bilen gennemgået af en uvildig, inden man når skæringsdatoen. I det hele taget anbefaler vi, at man løbende servicerer sin bil og får gennemgået bilens bremser og generelle stand. Gerne en gang om året. Det gælder uanset bilmærke, eller om bilen overhovedet har et fast serviceinterval.</span></span></span></p>

<p>Opdateret 24. januar:</p>

<p><span><span>FDM har bedt Tesla om en kommentar til dels synstallene for deres Model 3 dels kritikken af bilens kvalitet. Det er ikke lykkedes at få. I en mail til FDM gør Tesla dog opmærksom på, at Tesla Model 3 fik et større facelift i 2021, og at modellen i 2023 kom i en ny og markant forbedret udgave. </span></span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <article>
    <p>It happened on the afternoon of May 4th. A message from a colleague—who has since become a good friend—popped up on my screen, urging me to check my emails. When I opened my inbox, there it was: an email from the COO. The email announced an impending company-wide layoff and mentioned that, within a few minutes, I’d receive another email letting me know whether I was impacted. A short while later, the second email arrived. I was among those affected—along with most of my team.</p>

<p>The situation felt surreal. One by one, my colleagues posted in our team chat, confirming they’d been impacted too. Before our accounts were locked, we quickly jumped on a call. We had just 30 minutes to have one final conversation as a team, to say our goodbyes. It was a bittersweet moment, sharing those last words with people I’d worked so closely with.</p>

<p>It was difficult to process what was happening. Just ten months earlier, the company had gone through another round of layoffs. And at the beginning of the year, during the company’s kick-off event, the president assured us there wouldn’t be any more layoffs. They even said the company was performing well financially. So, why was this happening?</p>

<h2 id="signs-of-a-layoff">Signs of a Layoff</h2>

<p>Looking back, my colleagues and I were not entirely surprised by the layoff. There were several warning signs that hinted something was coming. I want to share these signs so you can be better prepared if you ever face a similar situation.</p>

<h3 id="1-cancellation-of-team-events">1. Cancellation of Team Events</h3>
<p>One of the earliest indicators was the sudden cancellation of team events. When I heard from other teams that their off-site events were canceled without any clear explanation, it immediately raised red flags. These cancellations often signal that the company is going to announce something about the team structure and doesn’t want you to be with your team in the same place. This is because one of your teammates—or you—might be impacted, and you’d need to cancel flights, hotels, etc. To avoid dealing with these logistical issues, the company preemptively cancels the event.</p>

<h3 id="2-unexpected-notifications-about-packages">2. Unexpected Notifications About Packages</h3>
<p>Some employees at the company received notifications about packages scheduled to arrive at their homes. This happens because services like DHL notify you through their app when a package is on the way. If your company requires you to return your work equipment, like a laptop, after being laid off, they often arrange for these shipping boxes to be delivered in advance. If you unexpectedly see a notification about a package from your company’s IT provider, it’s a strong sign that a layoff is imminent—and you may be impacted.</p>

<h3 id="3-lack-of-vision-from-leadership">3. Lack of Vision from Leadership</h3>
<p>The absence of a clear vision from leadership is one of the most common signs of an impending layoff. During off-site or kick-off events, you might notice that leaders seem unsure of the company’s direction. When this lack of clarity is followed by team restructuring, and then another restructuring just a few months later, it becomes evident that the leadership is struggling to find focus. Ultimately, this cycle often ends with a layoff, accompanied by yet another round of restructuring for those who remain.</p>

<h3 id="4-sudden-vague-meetings">4. Sudden, Vague Meetings</h3>
<p>Another sign is the appearance of unexpected, vague meetings on your calendar. These meetings are marked as “important” with no clear agenda, and attendance is mandatory. If this happens, it’s often a precursor to a layoff announcement. Public companies, in particular, may choose to send layoff notices via email to align the timing with when they notify investors.</p>

<h3 id="5-timing-around-quarterly-results">5. Timing Around Quarterly Results</h3>

<p>If your company is publicly traded, layoffs are frequently announced in conjunction with quarterly earnings reports. This can be especially stressful because, leading up to every financial results announcement, employees may anxiously wait to see if layoffs will accompany the news. If no layoffs are announced, you know you’re safe—for at least one more quarter.</p>

<h2 id="youre-just-a-row-in-an-excel-table">You’re Just a Row in an Excel Table</h2>

<p>When I looked back on my time at the company and all the things I had accomplished, I was surprised to be impacted by the layoffs. It wasn’t because I thought I was better than others—it was because I believed I was doing more than what was expected of me. However, during a layoff, it seems that who you are and what you do doesn’t matter. In most cases, the decision is made by people who don’t even know you. This realization made me question the concept of work, which is part of the reason I’m writing this blog post.</p>

<p>I was hired as a Backend Developer. When I joined my team, I noticed a project that needed a developer to implement the client-side feature in React Native. Although I had no prior experience with React Native, I had worked with React before, so I volunteered for the task. I shipped the feature without any issues, received positive feedback from my team and lead, and eventually, my title was changed to Developer, making me a full-stack developer.</p>

<p>In some instances, I worked on projects independently, always aligning with my team and ensuring my work was reviewed. I would implement the backend first and then move on to the client-side. This was my expected role, and in performance reviews, I was consistently rated as a high performer. Yet, I was always doing more than what was expected of me.</p>

<p>Sometimes, I worked on small features I thought would enhance the app. These features might not have been used by many, but they provided significant value to heavy users. Occasionally, I shipped these under the radar. I created dashboards to measure the impact of my team’s work, helping us focus on features that would bring the most value to users. I also built proof-of-concept features based on user requests to show leadership how easily they could be implemented, advocating for their prioritization. Additionally, I participated in hackdays, creating projects to showcase innovative ideas.</p>

<p>On several occasions, I was selected for special projects outside my team. These projects often came directly from the CEO, and I was chosen because I constantly wanted to do more for the company and our users. For some of these projects, I worked more than eight hours a day, including weekends. A few of these initiatives were mentioned in financial reports, praised by the CEO during all-hands meetings, or retweeted multiple times by the CEO on Twitter.</p>

<p>Over time, I gained the attention of senior management in my business unit, which consisted of about 400 people. I began directly interacting with the VP of Product and the VP of Engineering, both of whom were four or five levels above me. Occasionally, the VP of Product would message me directly to ask if a feature was feasible to implement. Later, the VP of Engineering started scheduling regular one-on-one meetings with me, which was highly uncommon. During these calls, he told me multiple times that if I continued working at this level, I could quickly climb the ladder to become a Staff Developer. He wasn’t the only one saying this to me.</p>

<p>Beyond my immediate role, I also sought ways to contribute to the broader company. Whenever a new tool was introduced, I would explore it, write detailed articles about my findings, and share them to help other teams use the tool more effectively.</p>

<p>I referred many friends and former colleagues to the company because I believed in its mission. If I recall correctly, I referred over ten people, four of whom received offers, and three were ultimately hired. I also encouraged many others to consider joining the company.</p>

<p>I even initiated discussions about translating our website into Turkish to support the many customers we had in Turkey. A few weeks before the layoff announcement, I was helping a team working on this project find a Turkish-speaking content designer because they noticed my willingness to assist.</p>

<p>Additionally, I tried to convince friends who were CTOs at major e-commerce companies to migrate their websites to our platform. Whenever I received job offers from e-commerce companies on LinkedIn, I used those opportunities to promote our platform instead. I passed along leads to the sales team and later noticed that one of those companies had indeed moved to our platform.</p>

<p>I’m not sharing all of this to brag but to highlight that, in the end, none of it mattered. On the day I announced I had been laid off, I received numerous messages from colleagues, even those I hadn’t worked with directly, telling me that I had inspired and motivated them. While those messages were heartwarming, they didn’t change the reality: to the company, I was just a row in an Excel sheet.</p>

<h2 id="the-broken-trust-of-modern-work">The Broken Trust of Modern Work</h2>

<p>Layoffs were uncommon when I started working, and being a developer felt like an incredibly safe job. In most professions, the unspoken rule was simple: if you performed well and the company was financially stable, your job was secure.</p>

<p>But today, companies are announcing layoffs alongside record-breaking financial results. You work hard, focus on impactful projects, and receive praise from your lead—only to find yourself let go by someone who likely doesn’t even know you exist. It feels as though the trust between companies and employees is now broken. Companies, it seems, are either unaware of this shift or unwilling to address it. And frankly, I’m not sure how they could fix it.</p>

<p>What’s particularly strange is that the layoffs predominantly affect individual contributors—the people who have little say in deciding the company’s direction. These are the team members closest to the users, the ones who spend hours planning how to improve the product. But after those plans are made, leadership often swoops in and redirects efforts toward entirely different goals. You trust their judgment, work on their priorities, and deliver on time. Then, when the arbitrary goals they set aren’t met, the company decides to cut staff. Those who made the poor decisions remain, and some are even promoted, while the people carrying out the work are let go. It feels surreal—like <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u48vYSLvKNQ">an episode from Silicon Valley</a>—but this is how big companies operate.</p>

<p>I’m not alone in feeling this way. Many friends and ex-colleagues who’ve been laid off in recent years share similar experiences. They’ve lost trust in their employers. They believe their efforts won’t matter in the long run and anticipate being part of the next layoff cycle. As a result, they only do what’s strictly required to avoid a performance improvement plan. No one goes above and beyond anymore; no one takes initiative to improve things. Why? Because it doesn’t matter. They’ve seen firsthand that it changes nothing.</p>

<p>For those like me who’ve experienced layoffs, work has become just that—work. You do what’s assigned, and if your company squanders your potential or forces you to waste time on unnecessary projects, you simply stop caring. You collect your paycheck at the end of the month, and that’s it. This is the new modern work: no more striving to be 40% better every year.</p>

<h2 id="the-myth-of-job-security-in-germany">The Myth of Job Security in Germany</h2>

<p>Since I was working for a German entity of a company, I want to address a common myth about job security in Germany. Many people believe that it’s nearly impossible to be fired in Germany. While this is partially true for individuals who have completed their probation period, it doesn’t hold up in the context of layoffs. If a company decides to lay off, for instance, 40 employees, German law doesn’t prevent this. Instead, the law enforces a social scoring system to determine who is affected, prioritizing the protection of the most vulnerable employees, such as those with children. In this sense, when it comes to layoffs, the difference between Germany and the US is minimal.</p>

<h2 id="suggestions-for-those-who-havent-been-laid-off-yet">Suggestions for Those Who Haven’t Been Laid Off (Yet)</h2>

<p>When I talk to friends who were laid off in recent years, we often reflect on what we could have done differently. Here are some of the lessons we’ve learned:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Stick to your contract hours.</strong> If your contract says 40 hours, work 40 hours—no more, no less. Protect your personal time and well-being.</li>
  <li><strong>Avoid going above and beyond with initiatives.</strong> Many companies encourage impactful work to earn promotions, but instead of chasing internal advancements, focus on switching companies to achieve your next career step.</li>
  <li><strong>Always keep interviewing.</strong> One of the biggest mistakes I’ve seen is stopping interviews after starting a new job, trusting in the company. Instead, continuously explore opportunities so that if a layoff happens, you already have other options lined up.</li>
  <li><strong>Leverage external offers for salary growth.</strong> Companies often resist giving substantial raises to existing employees but pay top dollar for new hires. Regularly interview elsewhere, and if you get an offer with a 20% or higher salary increase, consider taking it. Many people have seen their compensation triple or quadruple this way in just a few years.</li>
  <li><strong>Don’t overthink your résumé.</strong> Worrying about short experiences on your CV isn’t worth it. You can always tailor your résumé—leave out brief roles, or consolidate short-term jobs as freelance experience. Ultimately, your résumé is just a starting point; your skills will be assessed during the interview process.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>You’ve probably noticed that I didn’t mention the name of the company I was laid off from. That’s because I believe it’s irrelevant. Everything I’ve shared reflects the current state of the tech industry. It might differ at very small companies, but once you work at a company with more than 100 employees, you’ll likely encounter many of the same patterns I’ve described.</p>

<p>I’ve wanted to write about this topic for a long time, but it’s been difficult to find the energy. The subject itself is a deep disappointment for me, and every time I reflect on layoffs, it makes me profoundly sad. It’s a stark reminder of how companies treat workers as disposable. Before you join, they go to great lengths to make you feel valued and excited to accept their offer. You meet multiple people, and some even offer signing bonuses. But when layoffs come, you’re reduced to a name on a list. During the exit interview, a random person from the company reads a prepared script and can’t answer your questions. The HR team that once worked to make you feel valued doesn’t even conduct an actual conversation with you. That random person becomes the last connection you have to a company you spent years at.</p>

<p>The layoff fundamentally changed how I perceive work now. I don’t think that I’ll be the same person again.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.hedy.org/">https://www.hedy.org/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42837636">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main_page_content">
        
        <div>
                    <h2>Textual programming made easy!</h2>
                    
                    <p>Many schools and teachers around the world want to teach their students programming. Initially this is often done with playful tools, ranging from the Beebot robot to
Scratch Junior or Scratch. After using such tools, kids often want to move to more powerful, textual programming languages, like Python.</p>
<p>Python however is hard, because it is only available in English, and requires learners to learn complex programming concepts and syntax at once.
Hedy is the easy way to get started with textual programming languages! Hedy is free to use, open source, and unlike any other textual programming language in three ways.</p>
<ol>
<li>Hedy is multi-lingual, you can use Hedy in your own language</li>
<li>Hedy is gradual, so you can learn one concept and its syntax a time</li>
<li>Hedy is built for the classroom, allowing teachers to fully customize their student's experience</li>
</ol>

                </div>
        
        <div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Multi-lingual programming</h3>
                        <p>While almost all textual programming language have keywords in English, such as <code>for</code> or <code>repeat</code>, Hedy can be used in any language! We currently support 47 different languages, including Dutch, Spanish, Arabic, Turkish, Chinese and Hindi. If your language is not available you can always start a new translation.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p><img src="https://d1xliaqnpftsm2.cloudfront.net/static-bdbbcc20a24ec0b311573119d46d08f324f0eb99/images/hedy-multilang.png">
                </p></div>
        
        <div>
                    <p><img src="https://d1xliaqnpftsm2.cloudfront.net/static-bdbbcc20a24ec0b311573119d46d08f324f0eb99/images/hedy-grows.png"></p><div>
                        <h3>Step by step learning</h3>
                        <p>Learning a programming language can be overwhelming, since learners have to learn concepts (for example if-else or loops) and syntax (like quotation marks or round brackets) at the same time. In Hedy, concepts are first introduced with little syntax and then refined. A scientifically proven way to learn!</p>

                    </div>
                </div>
        
        <div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Built for the classroom</h3>
                        <p>Hedy is suitable for kids aged 10 and up and designed for classroom use.
Teachers can use our free, built-in lesson plans, but can also author their own lessons and load these into the Hedy user interface.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p><img src="https://d1xliaqnpftsm2.cloudfront.net/static-bdbbcc20a24ec0b311573119d46d08f324f0eb99/images/hedy-classroom.png">
                </p></div>
        
        <div>
                    <h2>Programming in context</h2>
                    
                    <p>Hedy shows programming in the broadest way possible, and can be used in variety of exciting ways. Hedy allows for the creation of digital and interactive stories, colorful drawings that can be shown on the screen but also drawn with a pen plotter or embroidered on a shirt, and can be used to create games or apps with buttons and keyboard actions.</p>

                </div>
        
        <div>
                    
                    <div>
                        <h3>Is Hedy free?</h3>
                        <p>Yes! Hedy is 'Open source', which means that everyone can help us make Hedy better.
You can find our code on <a href="https://github.com/hedyorg/hedy" target="_blank">Github</a>.
If you like Hedy and want to contribute, we accept (and are very grateful for) <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/hedyorg" target="_blank">donations</a>!</p>

                    </div>
                    
                    <div>
                        <h3>Do I need to install anything?</h3>
                        <p>No. Hedy works in the browser, which is the program you are using to look at this page. Probably Chrome or Edge or Firefox. Hedy also works on phones and tablets.</p>

                    </div>
                    
                    <div>
                        <h3>Do I need programming experience to teach with Hedy?</h3>
                        <p>No, that is not needed. All concepts are explained in the slides and in the interface for learners.
If you create a free teacher's account, you also get access to the teacher's manual with information on how to teach
and frequently made mistakes.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Cheap, no-nonsense email</h2><p>Let's get straight to the point:</p><ul><li>We host your email address.</li><li>We're IMAP and POP3 compatible, so we work with most mail apps.</li><ul><li>Or you can use our webmail, powered by <a href="https://roundcube.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Roundcube</a>.</li></ul><li>No arbitrary limits. Have as many users and store as much mail as you want.</li><li>Bring as many of your own domains as you want, or use one of ours. No extra charges.</li><li>It's cheap. Really, really cheap.</li></ul><h2>How cheap?</h2><p>Let's say you only need one email address, and have 3 GB of data to store. For one year of use, this will cost:</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://protonmail.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Protonmail</a></td><td>$48.00</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://fastmail.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fastmail</a></td><td>$60.00</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://workspace.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Workspace</a></td><td>$72.00</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://zoho.com/mail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zoho</a></td><td>$12.00</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://hushmail.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hushmail</a></td><td>$49.98</td></tr><tr><td>Purelymail</td><td>$10.00</td></tr></tbody></table><p>For most use cases, Purelymail is the cheapest option available. <b>Especially</b> if you need more than one user. All of the plans above charge per user, but we don't. Check out our <a href="https://purelymail.com/pricing">pricing page</a> for more information. (For an in-depth explanation of this particular comparison, <a href="https://purelymail.com/pricingcomparisonindepth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">see here.</a>)</p><h2>What's the catch?</h2><p>What you get here is  <i>purely</i> mail. </p><p>We're not trying to bamboozle you with glossy images, or sell you a lofty ideal. If we have a gimmick, it's that we offer a known service at a low price. What you do with it is up to you.</p><h3>An honest list of drawbacks</h3><p>Based on our experience, here are our weak points:</p><ul><li>Occasionally, obscure email servers will block emails sent through us. Usually this can be resolved within a day or two.</li><li>We don't have a 24/7 support staff, although we do try to get back to any inquiries within a day.</li><li>Some features other providers have, such as calendar syncing, are not yet implemented.</li><li>We're not for sending any type of unsolicited or marketing emails (you should use a dedicated marketing platform anyway).</li><li>Our UI can be a little unpolished and unglamorous, if that bothers you.</li></ul><h3>Also, we're in beta</h3><p>That means there might be a few hiccups along the way. If you run across any problems you can always <a href="https://purelymail.com/support">let us know,</a> and we'll do our best to fix them.</p><p>If you're interested in Purelymail but want to wait until we're out of beta, check out <a href="https://purelymail.com/betamailinglist">our mailing list.</a></p><h2>Is this for me?</h2><b>Do you want email?</b><p>Then yes, probably.</p><b>What about security and reliability?</b><p><a href="https://purelymail.com/docs/security">We do take security seriously.</a></p><p>As for reliability, we're in beta, but our architecture has proven itself robust so far, our infrastructure runs on the highly reliable AWS cloud, and even if we do have an outage the email protocols are pretty forgiving.

<p dir="auto">OpenHaystack is a framework for tracking personal Bluetooth devices via Apple's massive Find My network. Use it to create your own tracking <em>tags</em> that you can append to physical objects (keyrings, backpacks, ...) or integrate it into other Bluetooth-capable devices such as notebooks.</p>

<p dir="auto">OpenHaystack is an application that allows you to create your own accessories that are tracked by Apple's <a href="#how-does-apples-find-my-network-work">Find My network</a>. All you need is a Mac and a <a href="https://microbit.org/" rel="nofollow">BBC micro:bit</a> or any <a href="#how-to-track-other-bluetooth-devices">other Bluetooth-capable device</a>.
By using the app, you can track your accessories anywhere on earth without cellular coverage. Nearby iPhones will discover your accessories and upload their location to Apple's servers when they have a network connection.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">History</h3><a id="user-content-history" aria-label="Permalink: History" href="#history"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">OpenHaystack is the result of reverse-engineering and security analysis work of Apple's <em>Find My network</em> (or <em>offline finding</em>). We at the <a href="https://seemoo.de/" rel="nofollow">Secure Mobile Networking Lab</a> of TU Darmstadt started analyzing offline finding after its initial announcement in June 2019. We identified how Apple devices can be found by iPhones devices, even when they are offline through this work. The whole system is a clever combination of Bluetooth advertisements, public-key cryptography, and a central database of encrypted location reports. We disclosed a specification of the closed parts of offline finding and conducted a comprehensive security and privacy analysis.
We found two distinct vulnerabilities. The most severe one, which allowed a malicious application to access location data, has meanwhile been fixed by Apple (<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211849" rel="nofollow">CVE-2020-9986</a>).
For more information about the security analysis, please read <a href="#references">our paper</a>.
Since its release, we received quite a bit of <a href="https://owlink.org/press/" rel="nofollow">press and media coverage</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Disclaimer</h3><a id="user-content-disclaimer" aria-label="Permalink: Disclaimer" href="#disclaimer"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">OpenHaystack is experimental software. The code is untested and incomplete. For example, OpenHaystack accessories using our <a href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/blob/main/Firmware">firmware</a> broadcast a fixed public key and, therefore, are trackable by other devices in proximity (this might change in a future release). OpenHaystack is not affiliated with or endorsed by Apple Inc.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How to use <em>OpenHaystack</em>?</h2><a id="user-content-how-to-use-openhaystack" aria-label="Permalink: How to use OpenHaystack?" href="#how-to-use-openhaystack"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">OpenHaystack consists of two components. First, we provide a <a href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/blob/main/OpenHaystack">macOS application</a> that can display the last reported location of your personal Bluetooth devices. Second, the <a href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/blob/main/Firmware">firmware image</a> enables Bluetooth devices to broadcast beacons that make them discoverable by iPhones.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">System requirements</h3><a id="user-content-system-requirements" aria-label="Permalink: System requirements" href="#system-requirements"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">OpenHaystack requires macOS 11 (Big Sur).</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation</h3><a id="user-content-installation" aria-label="Permalink: Installation" href="#installation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The OpenHaystack application requires a custom plugin for Apple Mail. It is used to download location reports from Apple's servers via a private API (technical explanation: the plugin inherits Apple Mail's entitlements required to use this API).
Therefore, the installation procedure is slightly different and requires you to temporarily disable <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/security/gatekeeper-and-runtime-protection-sec5599b66df/1/web/1" rel="nofollow">Gatekeeper</a>.
Our plugin does not access any other private data such as emails (see <a href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/blob/main/OpenHaystack/OpenHaystackMail">source code</a>).</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Download a precompiled binary release from our <a href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/releases">GitHub page</a>.<br>
<em>Alternative:</em> build the application from source via Xcode.</li>
<li>Open OpenHaystack. This will ask you to install the Mail plugin in <code>~/Library/Mail/Bundle</code>.</li>
<li>Open a terminal and run <code>sudo spctl --master-disable</code>, which will disable Gatekeeper and allow our Apple Mail plugin to run.</li>
<li>Open Apple Mail. Go to <em>Preferences</em> → <em>General</em> → <em>Manage Plug-Ins...</em> and activate the checkbox next to <em>OpenHaystackMail.mailbundle</em>.
<ul dir="auto">
<li>If the <em>Manage Plug-Ins...</em> button does not appear. Run this command in terminal <code>sudo defaults write "/Library/Preferences/com.apple.mail" EnableBundles 1</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Allow access and restart Mail.</li>
<li>Open a terminal and enter <code>sudo spctl --master-enable</code>, which will enable Gatekeeper again.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h3><a id="user-content-usage" aria-label="Permalink: Usage" href="#usage"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Adding a new accessory.</strong>
To create a new accessory, you just need to enter a name for it and optionally select a suitable icon and a color. The app then generates a new key pair that is used to encrypt and decrypt the location reports. The private key is stored in your Mac's keychain.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Deploy to device.</strong>
Connect a <a href="#how-to-track-other-bluetooth-devices">supported device</a> via USB to your Mac and hit the <em>Deploy</em> button next to the accessory's name and choose the corresponding.
Instead of using OpenHaystack's integrated deployment, you may also copy the public key used for advertising (right click on accessory) and deploy it manually.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Display devices' locations.</strong>
It can take up to 30 minutes until you will see the first location report on the map on the right side. The map will always show all your items' most recent locations. You can click on every item to check when the last update was received.
By clicking the reload button, you can update the location reports.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How does Apple's Find My network work?</h2><a id="user-content-how-does-apples-find-my-network-work" aria-label="Permalink: How does Apple's Find My network work?" href="#how-does-apples-find-my-network-work"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">We briefly explain Apple's offline finding system (aka <a href="https://developer.apple.com/find-my/" rel="nofollow"><em>Find My network</em></a>). Please refer to our <a href="#references">PETS paper and Apple's accessory specification</a> for more details. We provide a schematic overview (from our paper) and explain how we integrate the different steps in OpenHaystack below.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/blob/main/Resources/FindMyOverview.png"><img src="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/raw/main/Resources/FindMyOverview.png" alt="Find My Overview"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Pairing (1)</h3><a id="user-content-pairing-1" aria-label="Permalink: Pairing (1)" href="#pairing-1"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">To use Apple's Find My network, we generate a public-private key pair on an elliptic curve (P-224). The private key remains on the Mac securely stored in the keychain, and the public key is deployed on the accessory, e.g., an attached micro:bit.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Losing (2)</h3><a id="user-content-losing-2" aria-label="Permalink: Losing (2)" href="#losing-2"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">In short, the accessories broadcast the public key as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) advertisements (see <a href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/blob/main/Firmware">firmware</a>).
Nearby iPhones will not be able to distinguish our accessories from a genuine Apple device or certified accessory.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Finding (3)</h3><a id="user-content-finding-3" aria-label="Permalink: Finding (3)" href="#finding-3"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">When a nearby iPhone receives a BLE advertisement, the iPhone fetches its current location via GPS, encrypts it using public key from the advertisement, and uploads the encrypted report to Apple's server.
All iPhones on iOS 13 or newer do this by default. OpenHaystack is not involved in this step.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Searching (4)</h3><a id="user-content-searching-4" aria-label="Permalink: Searching (4)" href="#searching-4"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Apple does not know which encrypted locations belong to which Apple account or device. Therefore, every Apple user can download any location report as long as they know the corresponding public key. This is not a security issue: all reports are end-to-end encrypted and cannot be decrypted unless one knows the corresponding private key (stored in the keychain). We leverage this feature to download the reports from Apple that have been created for our OpenHaystack accessories. We use our private keys to decrypt the location reports and show the most recent one on the map.</p>
<p dir="auto">Apple protects their database against arbitrary access by requiring an authenticated Apple user to download location reports.
We use our Apple Mail plugin, which runs with elevated privileges, to access the required authentication information. The OpenHaystack app communicates with the plugin while downloading reports. This is why you need to keep Mail open while using OpenHaystack.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How to track other Bluetooth devices?</h2><a id="user-content-how-to-track-other-bluetooth-devices" aria-label="Permalink: How to track other Bluetooth devices?" href="#how-to-track-other-bluetooth-devices"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">In principle, any Bluetooth device can be turned into an OpenHaystack accessory that is trackable via Apple's Find My network.
Currently, we provide a convenient deployment method of our OpenHaystack firmwares for a small number of embedded devices (see table below). We also support Linux devices via our generic HCI script.
Feel free to port OpenHaystack to other devices that support Bluetooth Low Energy based on the <a href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/blob/main/Firmware">source code of our firmware</a> and the specification in <a href="#references">our paper</a>. Please share your results with us!</p>

<p dir="auto">OpenHaystack Mobile is a complete reimplementation of the OpenHaystack macOS application for smartphones. The app provides the same functionality to create and track accessories and aims to increase the usability, especially for new users. In contrast to the macOS application, the location reports cannot be fetched directly on the smartphone, so the app requires a proxy server hosted on Mac hardware to access the Find My network. The proxy server can be accessed over a network by multiple users simultaneously.</p>
<p dir="auto">To connect to your proxy server set the correct URL in: openhaystack-mobile/lib/findMy/reports_fetcher.dart</p>

<p dir="auto">OpenHaystack Mobile is built with the cross-platform <a href="https://flutter.dev/" rel="nofollow">Flutter framework</a> and currently runs on Android and iOS. More information about the app and usage instructions can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/blob/main/openhaystack-mobile">openhaystack-mobile</a> folder of this repository.</p>

Here’s a personal memoir, with a few lessons in taking memorable snapshots.</em></p><figure></figure><p id="6280">My father was an avid amateur photographer. He loved to take pictures, he invested in expensive cameras, and I’ve plenty of vacation memories where he had one of those cameras in hand.</p><p id="3da3">But organizing the slides afterwards? Labeling them? No way. Pop threw the boxes of slides in big piles and said, “I’ll sort them after I retire.” And, in preparation for his retirement, he put all those slides into five huge boxes — the kind you’d use to ship vinyl records.</p><p id="da0f">Whereupon, three days after my father formally retired in 1988, he died in his sleep.</p><p id="54ec">The slides stayed with my mother. When she moved into assisted living, the boxes went into my sister’s garage. After mom died, three years ago, they came to me. The result was a huge project of scanning family slides — between 8,000 and 10,000 of them.</p><p id="326c">The primary goal was to save the photos before the media deteriorated beyond hope. It was too late in some cases. I remember Pop telling me how much cheaper Ektachrome was (compared to Kodachrome), but many of those images were as ghost-like as a half-remembered dream. Memories fade even faster. Is that a photo of my second cousin Charlotte? I’ve no idea.</p><p id="74e2">For those who want practical lessons, herein you will find two categories:</p><ul><li id="fa6a">How to go about a family photo archive project (or at least how I did it) and</li><li id="8730">Practical suggestions for taking photos that your family will treasure long after you’re gone.</li></ul><p id="412f">This was an oddly spiritual process. We take pictures of the moments we think are valuable or important. So, in the photos he took, I saw my father’s dreams, the things he thought were beautiful, his moments of pride. And in so doing, I gained more understanding of who my parents were. …but I’ll leave that essay to another time.</p><h2 id="1618">Logistics and project scope</h2><p id="03ea">I have spoken with several people who have similar family photo archives, so let me begin by describing I went about the project.</p><p id="4243">Before I began, I had an inexpensive <a href="http://amzn.to/2BzhIkw" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Wolverine slide scanner</a> but I knew a manual unit would not cut it. I bought a heavy-duty slide scanner to help me process the images. It’s a <a href="http://amzn.to/2u4f8Ee" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Canon CanoScan 9000F</a>. I like it, in case you’re shopping for an affordable unit; in particular, I do not loathe the built-in software, which sets it apart from other scanners I’ve used.</p><p id="c5f5">The project, which took me about a year, became a background process. I could scan a box of slides while I was reading my daily morning e-mail, then clean up and share the images during moments of down-time (such as waiting for poky websites to load site statistics). Over a weekend I usually could get through five or six boxes of slides.</p><p id="2d7d">Scanning a box of slides had several steps, each of which became a kind of emotional triage:</p><ul><li id="8ec0">I held up a slide (in front of a desk lamp) to identify it generally and decide if it was worth scanning. In other words: Do I care about this at all? Something out-of-focus easily could be thrown away. A picture of people I didn’t care about (e.g. someone my folks met on a bus tour and never spoke with again) could be dumped, too. It soon became obvious that I didn’t need to scan tourist photos; there are just-so-many pictures you need to see of the Tower of London (which looks the same today as it did in 1972 when my parents visited) or random sunsets over random mountains.</li><li id="551b">If the slide looked interesting, I did a fast preview scan. For instance, if my father took three pictures “just to be sure” I could choose the best image; I could throw out the ones where my brother had his eyes closed. And I could eliminate the pictures that were inherently uninteresting, by which I mean it brought me no sense of nostalgia.</li><li id="af41">By the time I scanned an image, I was pretty committed to keeping it and sharing it with my siblings. Sometimes, if an image was entertaining or meaningful, I’d share it among my friends on Facebook.</li></ul><p id="f7db">From a box of 24–36 slides, I usually shared about 8 with my brother and sisters. By the end of the project, I’d shared 2,800 images with my siblings, and a few hundred on Facebook.</p><p id="1933">I used iPhoto to clean up the images and sort them into a dedicated folder. While tools like PhotoShop certainly could do a better job (and were trotted out for a few special images), 98% were treated with iPhoto’s crop, straighten, and the “Enhance” button. I also added dates and locations to the images’ metadata.</p><p id="29cb">To share the images with my family, I uploaded photos to Flickr. Other photo sharing sites have far better user interfaces, but Flickr has two advantages: I can limit sharing to a set of people marked as friends-and-family, and viewers can comment on the images. Plus you can search images, if you’re smart enough to add tags as you go. (Do.)</p><p id="9e59">Towards the end I also created private Facebook groups, which let me share with cousins as well as siblings, though its search capabilities are poor. It’s been useful for sharing those videos, though, and for encouraging conversations among my relatives.</p><p id="db0d">For general sharing online, I created an Old Family Photos album on Facebook. iPhoto makes it easy to share to an album (though, alas, not to a private group). I’ve been astonished by how many of my family’s history touches a chord. Don’t be shy; but do keep your family’s privacy sensitivities in mind when you share.</p><h2 id="075f">A lifetime in five boxes</h2><p id="d606">The earliest roll of slides was from my parents’ engagement party circa 1941, followed by their honeymoon snapshots in 1942. Thousands of slides record their lives all the way through the 1980s, with a Family Circle gathering held only two months before my father’s death.</p><figure><figcaption><em>My mother at her engagement party, 1941, with her mother and my father’s stepmother</em></figcaption></figure><p id="b86f">Inside the big boxes were two shoeboxes with a hundred 8mm video movies, which went back to the 1920s but mainly record 1950s camping trips. (<a href="https://www.imemories.com/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">iMemories</a> did a very good job at digitizing those.)</p><p id="2aa3">Most images are from family vacations and special occasions, rather than “daily life.” Earlier vacations (1950s and 1960s) are mostly camping trips; later pictures are from trips to Europe, particularly when money eased up after “the kids left home.”</p><p id="d0ad">But more is visible than the campsites and Boy Scout trips. I saw a young couple’s struggles to cope with three young children (I was an afterthought); I watched their idealism diminish and exhaustion set in.</p><h2 id="72cc">Take pictures of interactions, and other lessons</h2><p id="480c">I threw away many thousands of pictures. Some of them undoubtedly had meaning to my parents, but nobody alive cares about those photos. Yet I also came across special moments — and none of us need to have “been there” to appreciate them.</p><p id="6992">In reviewing thousands of slides, I learned quite a bit about taking photos that capture a family’s life. Perhaps these lessons can help you, too, in considering which images to snap — on vacation or in daily life.</p><p id="844e"><strong>Those “title slides” are meaningful after all</strong>. I remember rolling my eyes whenever my father would station me in front of a road sign or National Park entrance. Such pictures seemed really lame.</p><p id="331f">As I reviewed the pictures, though, the title slides were priceless. In all those years, my parents went to dozens of beaches, gardens, and campsites in random mountain ranges. Other than the date on the slide (“Sep 83”) I have no way to identify which one it is. (Occasionally, there’s a scribbled note, like, “Explorer Trip” or “London.” Um, thanks, Pop.)</p><p id="aa29">So I was always glad when I found a photo of us kids standing next to a “Mystic Seaport” sign or “Underground tours” (always looking put-upon and sullen, because we were told to “Stand up straight! And smile — it might turn out good!”).</p><figure><figcaption><em>1963, in… well, see, we can tell!</em></figcaption></figure><p id="b085">Labels matter. Even a few words helped me know when-and-where something happened: “1955 Nova Scotia” or my grandfather’s name. One of the saddest experiences was looking at a family-gathering photo from the 50s with several people in it, and having no idea who’s in it. (Is that my great-aunt? Maybe my sister remembers? …and too often she didn’t.) If you inherit the photos, take the time to identify the people in them. Even if it’s obvious to you that the picture is of cousin Janet who died in 1943, you can’t assume that the next viewer will know.</p><figure><figcaption>Coin operated gas station, 1966</figcaption></figure><p id="111d"><em>Lesson</em>: Do take pictures that give the viewer a clue of where you are, and with whom.</p><p id="2274"><strong>Kodak picture spots aren’t memorable</strong>. Destination pictures surely remind the travelers of their experience. I’m sure that that picture of the beach in Portugal would have encouraged my father to say, “Thelma, remember that night?” That’s fine, for the people who participated. I’ve taken thousands of such photos myself.</p><p id="dd5c">But if I wasn’t there, the image brings me no nostalgia.</p><p id="8423">The worst of these pictures are the touristy photos. My father took plenty of pictures of the Eiffel Tower on their trip in the 70s. But the tower doesn’t look any different today, so I didn’t bother to scan those photos. In fact, I dumped boxes without even looking at the contents, because there’s nothing in that experience that speaks to anyone but the participants.</p><p id="b8ed"><em>Lesson</em>: It’s fine to take pictures that capture a moment for those who were present. But if <em>anyone</em> could have taken that photo, don’t expect anyone to care.</p><p id="1c7c"><strong>People pictures matter the most</strong>. Especially the non-staged ones. The formal pictures of special occasions, where we kids are lined up like we’re in front of a firing squad, are not the ones that bind us.</p><p id="3c15">The best family photos are the ones where we’re clowning around and laughing, or where we’re doing something together, or a moment captured without the subject realizing it. The most precious are those where the family is putting up a pup tent, or using the water pump, or packing the car for a trip.</p><figure><figcaption><em>Hanging up the kittens</em></figcaption></figure><p id="45e4">In general, try to capture your family when they are actively doing something, ideally an entire process. Let it be a photo essay: “Mom making Thanksgiving dinner” or “Daddy taking the kids to the petting zoo.” Don’t choose only the “reveal” moments such as Mom presenting the turkey to the table; include a picture of her hurriedly putting on lipstick before Grandpa arrives, or the kids conked out, asleep in the back seat, on the car trip home.</p><p id="4269">A few exceptions: Nobody looks attractive or interesting while he’s swimming. Few people look great sitting on a towel on the beach, wearing a bathing cap. Also don’t take pictures of people eating dinner, even at a fancy dinner. And while it’s no longer relevant, it was never a good idea to photograph exhausted travelers arriving at an airport gate.</p><figure><figcaption>Playing Mousetrap at home, 1964</figcaption></figure><p id="de29">Include the photographer. I have few pictures of my father, because he was always the guy behind the camera. When he did ask someone to take a picture it was always posed, such as “Mom and Pop standing in front of the Grand Canyon.”</p><p id="4651"><em>Lesson</em>: Photos that capture you “being there” — which means most selfies — rarely have meaning. <em>Doing</em> matters far more.</p><p id="6cc6"><strong>Take photos of daily life</strong>. I’m stunned by the pictures my father <em>didn’t</em> take. There isn’t a single photo that represents what my parents did for a living. They weren’t the type to attend company picnics, fine. But I found nothing indicating “take your daughter to work” or “Mom typing up a report” or “the building I worked in” or “the woman Mom commuted to work with for 10 years.” That would be more understandable if my parents disliked their jobs, but both of them were passionate about their careers.</p><p id="fe60">Take photos of people at rest. Even though I spent much of my childhood writing letters, there is only one photo of me with a pen in my hand — and that was taken by a friend at summer camp. Yet my friends and family all recall me with a book or pen within reach. My father never captured that essential part of who I was.</p><figure><figcaption>Your proprietor writing letters, 1973</figcaption></figure><p id="4c25">Some of the absences may reflect their superstitions. There are zero photos of any woman who is visibly pregnant. Maybe that was considered bad luck; I don’t know.</p><p id="e25b"><em>Lesson</em>: Don’t limit photo-taking to special occasions.</p><p id="b383"><strong>Take at least a short class in photography basics</strong>. Or read a basic book on the topic. As much as my father loved photography, he never got any kind of formal training. I spend a lot of editing time cropping images to take advantage of the simplest rule-of-thirds, for instance.</p><p id="b4ba">Even if you aren’t devoted to photography that much: Crop photos closely. My father took a lot of photos of “Mom in front of a pretty vista” but in the long run I care more about Mom’s expression than the expanse of mountains in the background. Thanks to iPhoto I can zoom in, but a lot of detail is lost.</p><p id="83c6"><em>Lesson</em>: Take the best quality photos you can. Your grandchildren will appreciate it.</p></div><div><p id="cd37">Ultimately, we all take family photos to help ourselves remember the moments we want to recall forever. Nothing suggests that those memories must last beyond our own lifetimes. But if you want your children’s children to recall who you are-and-were, these tips might help you achieve that.</p></div></div>]]></description>

 <p>After multiple attempts to get the perfect shot, Concorde had to reduce its speed from Mach 2 to Mach 1.5-1.6 to allow the Tornado crew to position themselves.</p> <p>Once in position, the Tornado crew managed to capture the photo but could only maintain formation for about four minutes before breaking off, as their fuel reserves rapidly dwindled. Meanwhile, the Concorde continued its effortless cruise toward New York’s JFK Airport. </p> <h2>One-of-a-Kind Airplane</h2> <p>Concorde was a marvel of aviation. On February 7, 1996, it completed its fastest transatlantic crossing, flying from New York to London in an astonishing 2 hours, 52 minutes, and 59 seconds. The supersonic jet had a maximum speed of Mach 2.04 (1,354 mph or 2,180 km/h at cruising altitude) and could carry between 92 and 128 passengers. Entering service in 1976, the Concorde remained in operation for 27 years, redefining air travel.</p> <div><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f7cAJv0Qfr8?si=EAcjB3tmKl695NA_" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div> <p>The Concorde was jointly developed by British Aircraft Corporation (BAC) and Aérospatiale under an Anglo-French treaty. A total of 20 Concorde aircraft were built, including six prototypes and development models. Air France and British Airways were the only airlines to operate the Concorde, using it primarily for transatlantic flights between London, Paris, New York, Washington, and Barbados. These routes were completed in less than half the time of traditional airliners.</p> <p>Despite its technological brilliance, Concorde was retired in 2003. Several factors contributed to its downfall, including the tragic crash of Air France Flight 4590 in July 2000, which claimed the lives of all onboard. The downturn in commercial aviation following the September 11 attacks, combined with the ceasing of maintenance support by Airbus, ultimately grounded the supersonic icon.</p>      </div>

However, Vanguard does not have plans to create a Vanguard bitcoin ETF or other crypto-related products. Additionally, such products from other issuers will not be offered on our brokerage platform. In this Q&amp;A, two Vanguard leaders—Janel Jackson, global head of ETF Capital Markets and Broker &amp; Index Relations, and Andrew Kadjeski, head of Brokerage &amp; Investments—discuss why.</p>

                    <p><b>Jackson:</b> No, given the current state of crypto as an asset class, Vanguard does not have plans to launch its own bitcoin ETF or any crypto-related products. When deciding what investment products to offer, we consider a range of factors, including whether we believe they have <i>enduring</i> investment merit and meet our clients’ needs. While the discussion about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, in general, has increased recently, we do not currently believe that there is an appropriate role for them to play in long-term portfolios. <sup>&nbsp;</sup></p>

                <h5><p>Why is Vanguard not offering crypto-related products on its brokerage platform?<sup>1</sup></p>
</h5>
            </div>
        

        <div>
                    	<p><a name="OLE_LINK10" id="OLE_LINK10"></a><b>Kadjeski:</b> Investors have a lot of choices these days when it comes to where to save for their retirement, invest for their kids’ education, and hold their emergency savings. Investors who come directly to Vanguard do so because they know we put their interests first<a name="OLE_LINK6" id="OLE_LINK6"></a>—and that is reflected in what products and services we <i>do</i> and <i>don’t</i> have on the shelf.</p>
<p>The easy step for us would have been just to allow full access to crypto-related products. But as a firm and a brokerage platform, we’re purposely structured to meet the needs of our investor-owners, most of whom are long-term, buy-and-hold investors.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p><b>Jackson:</b> In Vanguard’s view, crypto is more of a speculation than an investment. This is at the root of our decision to not offer crypto products, whether our own or others. With equities, you own a share of a company that produces goods or services, and many also pay dividends. With bonds, you get a stream of interest payments. Commodities are real assets that meet consumption needs, have inflation-hedging properties, and can play a <a href="https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/corporatesite/us/en/corp/articles/inflation-fighting-power-of-commodities.html" target="_self">role in certain portfolios</a>. While crypto has been classified as a commodity, it’s an immature asset class that has little history, no inherent economic value, no cash flow, and can create havoc within a portfolio.</p>
<p>Morningstar recently published a perceptive article pointing out that even a modest 5% allocation to bitcoin in an otherwise traditional balanced portfolio can drastically raise its risk profile.<sup>3</sup> This is driven, in large part, by bitcoin’s extreme volatility.</p>
<p><b>Kadjeski:</b> Over just the past three years, the price of bitcoin has increased by as much as 150% and declined by as much as 77%. Double-digit percent price drops are routine among cryptocurrencies. Remember that you need a 100% return just to make up for a 50% decline. And the more volatile an asset, the more tempting it is to trade. At Vanguard, our products and services are designed with the goal to help investors save more, trade less, and take a long-term approach—not chase trends and churn their portfolios.</p>

        <div>
                    	<p><b>Jackson:</b> There have been several investment trends in the past—the internet funds in the late 1990s for example—that Vanguard could have capitalized on. But we always ask ourselves, “Does this meet our investors’ long-term needs?” In hindsight, in nearly all cases, I believe we made the right call, ultimately benefiting our clients.<b></b></p>
<p><b>Kadjeski:</b> The same line of thinking applies to our brokerage platform. In 2019, we decided to remove access to leveraged and inverse funds and ETFs. These products are often misunderstood and misused by investors and can magnify losses. Similarly, in 2022, we stopped offering most over-the-counter stocks, which are prone to high risk, low liquidity, and potential fraud.</p>
<p><b>Jackson:</b> We understand that our decision on crypto is not popular among some investors, but many know that we’re being consistent with our philosophy and past practice.<sup>4 </sup>Our mission statement to give investors the best chance for investment success isn’t just a saying for us. It’s built into our DNA and we’re staying true to our mission by making this decision.&nbsp;</p>

Here’s what you can expect from this release:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Opensource Models:</strong> We’re releasing two new checkpoints, <strong>Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-1M</strong> and <strong>Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct-1M</strong>, marking the first time we’ve upgraded our opensource Qwen models to handle 1M-token contexts.</p></li><li><p><strong>Inference Framework:</strong> To help developers deploy the Qwen2.5-1M series models more efficiently, we’ve fully open-sourced our inference framework based on <a href="https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm">vLLM</a>. With integration with sparse attention methods, our framework can process 1M-token inputs <strong>3x to 7x</strong> faster.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2.5-1M/Qwen2_5_1M_Technical_Report.pdf">Technical Report</a>:</strong> We’re also sharing the technical details behind the Qwen2.5-1M series, including design insights for training and inference frameworks, as well as ablation experiments.</p></li></ol><p>You can experience Qwen2.5-1M models online by visiting our demo on <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/Qwen/Qwen2.5-1M-Demo">Huggingface</a> and <a href="https://www.modelscope.cn/studios/Qwen/Qwen2.5-1M-Demo">Modelscope</a>.</p><p>Additionally, we recently introduced <strong><a href="https://chat.qwenlm.ai/">Qwen Chat</a></strong>, an advanced AI assistant from the Qwen series. With Qwen Chat, you can engage in conversations, write code, perform searches, generate images and videos, and utilize various tools. Notably, Qwen Chat also features the Qwen2.5-Turbo model, which supports long-context processing with a context length of up to 1M tokens.</p><h2 id="model-performance">Model Performance</h2><p>Let’s start by diving into the performance of the Qwen2.5-1M series models, covering both long-context and short text tasks.</p><h2 id="long-context-tasks">Long-Context Tasks</h2><p>First off, we evaluate the Qwen2.5-1M models on the Passkey Retrieval task with a context length of 1 million tokens. The results show that these models can accurately retrieve hidden information from documents containing up to 1M tokens, with only minor errors observed in the 7B model.</p><figure><img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2.5-1M/passkey_retrieval.png#center" width="100%"></figure><p>For more complex long-context understanding tasks, we select <a href="https://github.com/hsiehjackson/RULER">RULER</a>, <a href="https://github.com/infinigence/LVEval">LV-Eval</a>, <a href="https://github.com/THUDM/LongAlign">LongbenchChat</a> used in <a href="https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-turbo/#more-complex-long-text-tasks">this blog</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2.5-1M/ruler.png#center" width="80%"></figure><figure><img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2.5-1M/lv-eval.png#center" width="80%"></figure><p>From these results, we can draw a few key conclusions:</p><ul><li><strong>Significantly Superior to the 128k Version:</strong> The Qwen2.5-1M series models significantly outperform their 128K counterparts in most long-context tasks, especially for sequences exceeding 64K in length.</li><li><strong>Notable Performance Advantage:</strong> The Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct-1M model not only beats Qwen2.5-Turbo but also consistently outperforms GPT-4o-mini across multiple datasets, offering a robust open-source alternative for long-context tasks.</li></ul><h2 id="short-context-tasks">Short-Context Tasks</h2><p>Besides performance on long sequences, we’re equally interested in how these models handle short sequences. So, we compare the Qwen2.5-1M models and their 128K versions on widely used academic benchmarks, throwing in GPT-4o-mini for comparison.</p><figure><img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2.5-1M/short_result.png#center" width="80%"></figure><p>Here’s what we find:</p><ul><li>Both Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-1M and Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct-1M maintain performance on short text tasks that is similar to their 128K versions, ensuring the fundamental capabilities haven’t been compromised by the addition of long-sequence processing abilities.</li><li>Compared to GPT-4o-mini, both Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct-1M and Qwen2.5-Turbo achieve similar performance on short text tasks while supporting a context length that’s eight times longer.</li></ul><h2 id="key-techniques">Key Techniques</h2><p>Here, we’ll briefly introduce the key techniques behind building Qwen2.5-1M. For more details, please check out our <a href="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2.5-1M/Qwen2_5_1M_Technical_Report.pdf">technical report</a>.</p><h2 id="long-context-training">Long-Context Training</h2><figure><img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2.5-1M/training_stages.png#center" width="70%"></figure><p>Training with long sequences demands substantial computational resources, so we adopt a progressive approach to expand the context length for Qwen2.5-1M through multiple stages:</p><ul><li>We begin with an intermediate checkpoint of pre-trained Qwen2.5, which had a 4K token context length.</li><li><strong>In Pretraining</strong>, we gradually increase the context length from 4K to 256K tokens while using <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16039">Adjusted Base Frequency</a>, raising the RoPE base from 10,000 to 10,000,000.</li><li><strong>In Supervised Fine-tuning</strong>, we split this into two stages to preserve performance on shorter sequences:<ul><li><strong>Stage 1:</strong> Fine-tuned only on short instructions (up to 32K tokens) using the same data and steps as the 128K versions of Qwen2.5.</li><li><strong>Stage 2:</strong> Mixed short (up to 32K) and long (up to 256K) instructions to enhance long-context task performance while maintaining short-task quality.</li></ul></li><li><strong>In Reinforcement Learning</strong>, we train models on short texts up to 8K tokens, which sufficiently improves alignment with human preferences and generalizes well to long-context tasks.</li></ul><p>The final instruction-tuned models are capable of handling sequences up to 256K tokens.</p><p>During training, we develop an instruction-tuned model with a context length of 256K tokens. To extend this to 1M tokens, we employ length extrapolation techniques.</p><p>The degradation of LLMs based on RoPE in long-context tasks is mainly due to unseen, large relative positional distances between queries and keys in computing attention weight. We employ <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17463"><strong>Dual Chunk Attention</strong></a> (DCA), which addresses this issue by remapping relative positions to smaller values, avoiding the large distances not seen during training.</p><figure><img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2.5-1M/dca.png#center" width="70%"></figure><p>We evaluat the Qwen2.5-1M models and their 128K counterparts with and without the length extrapolation method. We can find:</p><p>Even models trained on just 32K tokens, such as the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, achieve nearly perfect accuracy in passkey retrieval tasks with 1M-token contexts. This underscores the remarkable ability of DCA to extend supported context lengths, without any training required.</p><figure><img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2.5-1M/dca_ablation.png#center" width="40%"></figure><h2 id="sparse-attention">Sparse Attention</h2><p>For long-context language models, inference speed is crucial for user experience. We introduce a sparse attention mechanism based on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02490"><strong>MInference</strong></a> to accelerate the prefill phase. Furthermore, we propose several improvements:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Integrating with Chunked Prefill:</strong> Directly processing sequences of 1M tokens results in substantial memory overhead to store the activations in MLP layers, consuming 71GB of VRAM in Qwen2.5-7B. By integrating with chunk prefill with a chunk length of 32,768 tokens, activation VRAM usage is reduced by 96.7%, leading to a significant decrease in memory consumption.</p></li><li><p><strong>Integrating with Length Extrapolation:</strong> We integrate DCA with MInference in long-context processing, thereby enhancing inference efficiency and achieving greater accuracy.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sparsity Refinement on Long Sequences:</strong> MInference requires an offline search to determine the optimal sparsification configuration for each attention head. Due to the computational demand of full attention weights, this search is typically conducted on short sequences, which may not generalize well to longer sequences. We developed a method to refine the sparsification configuration specifically for sequences up to 1M tokens, which significantly reduces the accuracy loss brought by sparse attention.</p></li><li><p><strong>More Optimizations:</strong> We introduce additional optimizations, such as enhanced kernel efficiency and dynamic chunked pipeline parallelism, to fully unlock the potential of the entire framework.</p></li></ul><p>With these enhancements, our inference framework results in a 3.2x to 6.7x acceleration in the prefill speed across different model sizes and GPU devices for sequences of 1M token length.</p><figure><img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2.5-1M/speed.png#center" width="85%"></figure><h2 id="deploy-qwen25-1m-models-locally">Deploy Qwen2.5-1M Models Locally</h2><p>Here we provide step-by-step instructions for deploying the Qwen2.5-1M models on your local devices.</p><h3 id="1-system-preparation">1.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Date: 2025-01-26 <br>
Git: <a href="https://gitlab.com/mort96/blog/blob/published/content/00000-home/00016-wayland-input-latency.md">https://gitlab.com/mort96/blog/blob/published/content/00000-home/00016-wayland-input-latency.md</a></p>
<p>Yesterday, I read this blog post:
<a href="https://gist.github.com/generic-internet-user/e8eec46ce159571032115f6fb064523c">Wayland Cursor Lag: Just give me a break already...</a>,
where a Linux user discusses their frustration with input latency under Wayland.
They detailed their own subjective experience of the problem,
but failed to produce hard evidence.</p>
<p>Even though I'm a very happy user of wayland overall,
I share the blog post's author's subjective impression that there's more
cursor lag under Wayland than under X11.
In my opinion, their experiment was limited by their phone camera's 90 FPS,
which really doesn't feel like it's enough to get conclusive numbers
when we're talking about differences which are probably on the order of
single screen refresh cycles.</p>
<p>So I thought: hey, I have a phone with a 240 FPS camera mode,
I bet that's enough to get some conclusive results!</p>
<p>Spoilers: I was right.</p>
<h2>Experimental design</h2>
<p>I simply pointed my phone's camera at the screen and desk using my left hand,
made sure to get the mouse cursor, the mouse and my right hand in frame,
and recorded myself repeatedly flicking the mouse with my finger.
I recorded myself flicking it 16 times under Wayland,
logged out of the GNOME Wayland session and into a GNOME X11 session,
then did the same there.</p>
<p>I then converted the two resulting video files into a series of JPEGs
using ffmpeg (<code>ffmpeg -i &lt;input file&gt; %04d.jpg</code>),
and counted from the first frame where I could see the mouse move
until the first frame where I could clearly see that the cursor had moved.</p>
<p>I elected to include the start and end frame;
so if I saw the mouse move in frame 1045,
then I saw the cursor move in frame 1047,
I would count that as 3 frames.</p>
<p>Here's an example which depicts a latency of 3 frames (requires JavaScript):</p>
<div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://mort.coffee/_/imgs/wayland-latency-before-1.jpg" alt="before 1"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here's a frame from before the mouse has begun moving.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://mort.coffee/_/imgs/wayland-latency-before-2.jpg" alt="before 2"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The mouse still hasn't moved.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://mort.coffee/_/imgs/wayland-latency-moved-1.jpg" alt="mouse moving"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here, the mouse has just about started moving,
so I consider this "frame 1".
The cursor hasn't moved yet.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://mort.coffee/_/imgs/wayland-latency-moved-2.jpg" alt="still moving"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The mouse moves a bit further, but the cursor still hasn't moved.
This is "frame 2".</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://mort.coffee/_/imgs/wayland-latency-cursor.jpg" alt="cursor moved"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the frame where the cursor starts moving.
This is "frame 3", so I would note down this sequence
as taking 3 frames.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<p>Hardware details:</p>
<ul>
<li>Distro: Fedora Workstation 41</li>
<li>GNOME version: 47</li>
<li>CPU: AMD Ryzen 9 5950X</li>
<li>GPU: AMD Radeon RX 7900XT</li>
<li>Monitor: Gigabyte M32U (4k IPS @ 144.99, no DPI scaling)</li>
<li>Mouse: Logitech G502 Lightspeed</li>
<li>Camera: iPhone 15 Pro, slo-mo 240 FPS</li>
</ul>
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>The main limitations of this experiment are:</p>
<ul>
<li>240 FPS still isn't <em>that</em> much. With my 144Hz screen, I have less than
two camera frames per screen refresh. This introduces some random variance.</li>
<li>Pixels don't switch instantly, so there are ambiguous frames where the cursor
is <em>barely</em> starting to become visible in its new location.
I decided to count the cursor as "having moved" when there is a clearly visible
cursor in a new location on the screen, even if the pixels haven't fully lit up.</li>
<li>For some reason, the video recording from my phone contains some duplicate frames.
I don't know why this happens. I decided to interpret these duplicate frames
as a representation of a frame's worth of time passing, so I counted them as normal.</li>
</ul>
<p>All these factors introduce some uncertainty in the results.
However, they <em>should</em> affect Wayland and X11 equally, so with enough data,
it should all even out.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Another caveat I should clearly point out is that there are
many other Wayland compositors out there than GNOME's, and I have not tested them.
For that matter, there are other GPU drivers out there than AMD's.
Other compositors and other GPU drivers may show different results.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Here's the data I captured:</p>

<p>Wayland, on average, has roughly 6.5ms more cursor latency than X11 on my system.
I don't have the statistics expertise necessary to properly analyze
whether this difference is statistically significant or not,
but to my untrained eye, it looks like there's a clear and consistent difference.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the difference is very close to 1 full screen refresh.
I don't know whether or not that's a coincidence.</p>
<p>Here are the numbers in chart form:</p>
<p><img src="https://mort.coffee/_/imgs/wayland-latency-chart.svg" alt="Latency chart"></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In my mind, these results are conclusive proof that there <em>is</em> a difference
in input latency between X11 and Wayland, at least with my hardware,
and that the difference is large enough that it's plausible for some people to notice.</p>
<p>Further testing on more varied hardware and refresh rates is necessary
to get a clear picture of how wide-spread the problem is and how large it is.
It's likely that the magnitude of the difference varies based on factors
such as which compositor is used and what the refresh rate of the screen is.</p>
<p>I probably won't undertake that further testing,
because this is all very time intensive work.
My goal was only to see if I could conclusively measure <em>some</em> difference.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I want to add a note here about what this testing does <em>not</em> show.
It does not show that there's higher input latency <em>in general</em>
in Wayland compared to X11 in a way which affects, for example, games.
It is possible that this added latency is entirely cursor-specific
and that Wayland and X11 exhibit the exact same input latency
in graphical applications and games.
It is my understanding that the cursor is handled very differently from
normal graphical applications.
Further testing would be necessary to show whether Wayland has more input latency
<em>in games</em> than X11.</p>

Maybe, before trying another rollout, they might talk to a few customers, do some focus groups, even ask a few members of the press and analyst community for their advice.</p><p>But no.</p><p>Shortly after the New Year, someone in Redmond pushed a button that <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/its-official-all-your-office-apps-are-getting-ai-and-a-price-increase/">raised the price</a> of its popular (84 million paid subscribers worldwide!) Microsoft 365 product. You know, the one that used to be called Microsoft Office? Yeah, well, now the app is called Microsoft 365 Copilot, and you're going to be paying at least 30% more for that subscription starting with your next bill.</p><figure><div><picture><!----> <img src="" alt="microsoft-365-copilot-rebranding" width="740" height="870.8703703703703" fetchpriority="low"></picture></div> <figcaption><div><p>Microsoft 365 gets a new logo, a new name, and a higher price.</p></div> <span>Screenshot by Ed Bott/ZDNET</span></figcaption></figure><p>As far as I can tell, the response from customers has been overwhelmingly negative. I monitor Microsoft-focused online forums obsessively, and I read hundreds of complaints without seeing a single compliment. Seriously, the reaction to this rollout was an Excel #DIV/0 error.</p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/smart-home/microsoft-is-changing-the-way-you-sign-in-and-it-could-be-a-security-nightmare/">Microsoft is changing the way you sign in - and it could be a security nightmare</a></strong></p><p>What went wrong? Where do I begin?</p><h2>They botched the price increase</h2><p>Let me bend over backward to Microsoft here. They launched Office 365 (which later became Microsoft 365) more than a dozen years ago, and in that time they have not raised the price once. In case you haven't noticed, we are living through some inflationary times right now.</p><p>So, there was plenty of room for Microsoft to roll out a gentle price increase. "Hey y'all, we know this isn't welcome news but we need to bump up the Microsoft 365 subscription price by two bucks a month. It's still a great deal!"</p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11-in-2025/">How to upgrade your 'incompatible' Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 in 2025</a></strong></p><p>Netflix does that every year or two and no one shows up at Netflix HQ with pitchforks and torches.</p><p>But no. Instead, they made it a 30% price increase and <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/its-official-all-your-office-apps-are-getting-ai-and-a-price-increase/">blamed it all on artificial intelligence</a>. Bad idea. Why? Because...</p><!----><h2>No one wants to pay for AI</h2><p>There's a ton of potential in AI, and it has some solid use cases today, for tasks like <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-use-chatgpt-to-write-code-what-it-does-well-and-what-it-doesnt/">writing code</a> and finding patterns in large databases.</p><p>But in the places where Microsoft 365 Family and Personal subscribers are likely to see AI, the edges are still very, very rough. If you ask Copilot in Word to write something for you, the results will be about what you'd expect from an enthusiastic summer intern. You might fare better if you ask Copilot to turn a folder full of photos into a PowerPoint presentation. But is that task really such a challenge?</p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-best-ai-for-coding-in-2025-and-what-not-to-use/">The best AI for coding in 2025 (and what not to use)</a></strong></p><p>To top that off, there are similarly rough edges in the way the Copilot features are implemented. For example, I have both work and family subscriptions to Microsoft 365. This combination normally works very well; I can sign in with one account, attach resources like OneDrive from both accounts, and work with almost no friction.</p><p>But good luck doing the same with Copilot features. In that configuration, I consistently get error messages telling me, "As a Microsoft 365 Personal or Family subscriber, you'll be able to use Copilot when you're signed with your Microsoft work or school account (<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-launches-entra-a-new-identity-and-access-family-of-products/">Entra ID</a>) and Microsoft personal account. However, that ability is not yet available."</p><figure><div><picture><!----> <img src="" alt="m365-copilot-error" width="740" height="994.2798353909466" fetchpriority="low"></picture></div> <figcaption><div><p>If you pay for a personal and work subscription to Microsoft 365, you'll pay the higher price but won't get the new features.</p></div> <span>Screenshot by Ed Bott/ZDNET</span></figcaption></figure><p>Let me see if I understand this: I'm paying Microsoft for not one but two subscriptions, and they raised the price of one of those subscriptions while not allowing me to use its signature feature. That seems like a lousy way to reward your best customers.</p><h2>The announcement was bungled, too</h2><p>I pay annually for my Microsoft 365 Family subscription. The price went up more than a week ago, but I haven't received an email telling me about it. As the account manager, I should see that notice before I see the new price in my dashboard.</p><p>Instead, I learned about the new price thanks to a pop-up message on my Android phone.</p><figure><div><picture><!----> <img src="" alt="price-change-for-microsoft-365" width="740" height="1178.5185185185185" fetchpriority="low"></picture></div> <figcaption><div><p>This po-up on my phone is the only notice I've received about a price change.&nbsp;</p></div> <span>Screenshot by Ed Bott/ZDNET</span></figcaption></figure><p>That notice tells me I have a monthly plan. No, I have an annual plan that will renew in a month or two. It says I can cancel billing in my Play Store settings. No, I can't. I bought this subscription using the web browser on my Windows PC, and when I tap the Subscriptions button in the Android app it opens a web browser and takes me to my Microsoft account page, where I have to tap the Manage button to find the cancel option.</p><p>It could be worse, I suppose. Just ask the French and Spanish subscribers who got a similar pop-up message telling them their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Office365/comments/1i75h77/microsoft_365_from_10_to_1300_a_month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">price had gone from €10 a month to €13,000</a>. (Those pesky decimals.)</p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/smart-home/microsoft-is-changing-the-way-you-sign-in-and-it-could-be-a-security-nightmare/">Microsoft is changing the way you sign in - and it could be a security nightmare</a></strong></p><p>Oh, and I've lost count of the number of people who were baffled and angry that Microsoft had forcibly installed the Copilot app on their devices. It was just a rebranding of the old Microsoft 365 app with the new name and logo, but in my case it was days later before I received yet another pop-up message telling me about the change.</p><h2>Well, surely you can just turn it off. Right?</h2><p>The smartest thing Microsoft could have done was to make this initial release of Copilot an opt-in feature for a few months. They could have said, "We're excited to let everyone try this! Just click OK here!"</p><p>Instead, they turned the feature on for everyone and gave Word users a well-hidden checkbox that reads Enable Copilot. The feature is on by default, so you have to clear the checkbox to make it go away.</p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-office-support-in-windows-10-ends-in-october-too-what-that-really-means/">Microsoft Office support in Windows 10 ends in October too - what that really means</a></strong></p><p>As for the other Office apps? "Uh, we'll get around to giving you a button to turn it off next month. Maybe."</p><p>Seriously, the&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/how-to-turn-off-copilot-in-microsoft-365-family-and-personal-subscriptions-bc7e530b-152d-4123-8e78-edc06f8b85f1" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">support page that explains where you can find that box in Word</a>&nbsp;says, "We're working on adding the Enable Copilot checkbox to Excel, OneNote, and PowerPoint on Windows devices and to Excel and PowerPoint on Mac devices. That is tentatively scheduled to happen in February 2025." Until the Enable Copilot button is available, you can't disable Copilot.</p><p>Meanwhile, maybe think twice about using the option to disable all of the connected features in your Office apps. As&nbsp;<a href="https://laurenhough.substack.com/p/there-are-some-swear-words-in-this" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">one writer pointed out</a>&nbsp;(with multiple swear words and some threats aimed in the general direction of One Microsoft Way), doing so can have unintended consequences, like making it appear as though all your files in OneDrive have suddenly disappeared.</p><h2>How long will the Classic option last?</h2><p>If you try to cancel Microsoft 365 to avoid the price increase (or just to say no to the AI features), Microsoft's subscription  management page offers the option to downgrade to a Classic plan, which turns out to be exactly what you signed up for not that long ago, minus the price increase.</p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-top-10-brands-exploited-in-phishing-attacks-and-how-to-protect-yourself/">The top 10 brands exploited in phishing attacks - and how to protect yourself</a></strong></p><p>That's purely a retention play, of course. New subscribers can't sign up for this plan, and I expect that it will be discontinued in a year or two.&nbsp;</p><h2>Why is Microsoft doing this?</h2><p>I have yet to see a single person praising the implementation of Copilot in Microsoft 365 or telling Satya Nadella they've gotten their money's worth out of this unexpected upgrade.</p><p>So, why do it at all? I can think of 3 billion reasons. I could plug the numbers into Excel and tell you about it, but let's have Copilot explain instead.</p><figure><div><picture><!----> <img src="" alt="microsoft-copilot-dows-math" width="1280" height="1176.167832167832" fetchpriority="low"></picture></div> <figcaption><div><p>Microsoft Copilot understands how the subscription business model works.</p></div> <span>Screenshot by Ed Bott/ZDNET</span></figcaption></figure><p>Microsoft is halfway through its 2026 fiscal year.
