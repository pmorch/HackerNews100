          <p>The Unix shell is a powerful tool, and the Unix ecosystem provides an
incredible array of tools for working with strings. But the shell
really only knows how to work with one data <em>structure</em>: the
filesystem. Modern systems use all kinds of
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-structured_data"><em>semi-structured</em></a>
data, like JSON or YAML. These semi-structured formats are essentially
trees, and string processing is a bad match‚Äîediting JSON with sed is
not a very good idea!</p>

<p><img src="https://mgree.github.io/ffs/assets/images/inplace_demo.gif" alt="Demo of in-place editing, starting from an empty JSON object to building up a compound one; transcript is below"></p>

<p>ffs‚Äîshort for the <strong>f</strong>ile <strong>f</strong>ile<strong>s</strong>ystem‚Äîlets you mount
semi-structured data as a filesystem, letting you work with modern
formats using your familiar shell tools.</p>

<p>Currently, ffs supports <a href="https://www.json.org/">JSON</a>,
<a href="https://yaml.org/">YAML</a>, and <a href="https://toml.io/en/">TOML</a>, with more
to come.</p>

<p>You can read more about it in <a href="https://mgree.github.io/ffs/ffs.1.html">the <code>ffs</code> manpage</a>.</p>

<p>Run <code>ffs [file]</code> to mount <code>file.blah</code> at the mountpoint <code>file</code>. The
final, updated version of the file will be outputted on stdout.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span><span>cat </span>object.json

<span>{"eyes":2,"fingernails":10,"human":true,"name":"Mikey Indiana","nose":1,"pockets":{"pants":"keys","shirt":"pen"}}
</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Notice a few things: the <code>nose</code> key of the resulting object has a
number as its value, not a string; the <code>pockets</code> directory got turned
into an object.</p>

<p>You can specify an explicit mountpoint by running <code>ffs -m MOUNT file</code>;
you can specify an output file with <code>-o OUTPUT</code>. You can edit a file
in place by running <code>ffs -i file</code> (as in the gif above)‚Äîwhen the
volume is unmounted, the resulting output will be written back to
<code>file</code>. Here‚Äôs the transcript:</p>

                                        <p>WASHINGTON (AP) ‚Äî <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/us-drug-enforcement-administration">The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration</a></span> will move to reclassify <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/marijuana">marijuana</a></span> as a less dangerous drug, The Associated Press has learned, a historic shift to generations of American drug policy that could have wide ripple effects across the country.</p><p>The DEA‚Äôs proposal, which still must be reviewed by the White House Office of Management and Budget, would recognize <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/marijuana-health-schumer-becerra-dea-c00db5dabbeb9efd94cf17baff241e85">the medical uses of cannabis</a></span> and acknowledge it has less potential for abuse than some of the nation‚Äôs most dangerous drugs. However, it would not legalize marijuana outright for recreational use.</p><p>The agency‚Äôs move, confirmed to the AP on Tuesday by five people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive regulatory review, clears the last significant regulatory hurdle before the agency‚Äôs biggest policy change in more than 50 years can take effect. </p>
    

<p>Once OMB signs off, the DEA will take public comment on the plan to move marijuana from its current classification as a Schedule I drug, alongside heroin and LSD. It moves pot to Schedule III, alongside ketamine and some anabolic steroids, <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/marijuana-federal-regulation-reclassifying-health-b0b5fc3d34a83d2c95db1665f8149d42">following a recommendation</a></span> from the federal Health and Human Services Department. After the public comment period and a review by an administrative judge, the agency would eventually publish the final rule.</p>



<p>It comes after President Joe Biden called for a review of federal marijuana law in October 2022 and moved to <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-marijuana-government-and-politics-2d5e3d9e2cfbbbe3ee114536738894a8">pardon thousands of Americans</a></span> convicted federally of simple possession of the drug. He has also called on governors and local leaders to take similar steps to erase marijuana convictions.</p>
    
<p>‚ÄúCriminal records for marijuana use and possession have imposed needless barriers to employment, housing, and educational opportunities,‚Äù Biden said in December. ‚ÄúToo many lives have been upended because of our failed approach to marijuana. It‚Äôs time that we right these wrongs.‚Äù</p>
    

<p>The election year announcement could help Biden, a Democrat, boost flagging support, particularly among <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-2024-campaign-oldest-president-young-voters-152d11d3090518a2e5eee63b9a596673">younger voters</a></span>.</p><p>Biden and a growing number of lawmakers from both major political parties have been pushing for the DEA decision as marijuana has become increasingly decriminalized and accepted, particularly by younger people. A Gallup poll last fall found 70% of adults support legalization, the highest level yet recorded by the polling firm and more than double the roughly 30% who backed it in 2000.</p><p>The DEA didn‚Äôt respond to repeated requests for comment.</p><p>Schedule III drugs are still controlled substances and subject to rules and regulations, and people who traffic in them without permission could still face federal criminal prosecution. </p><p>Some critics argue the DEA shouldn‚Äôt change course on marijuana, saying rescheduling isn‚Äôt necessary and could lead to harmful side effects. </p><p>Jack Riley, a former deputy administrator of the DEA, said he had concerns about the proposed change because he thinks marijuana remains a possible ‚Äúgateway drug,‚Äù one that may lead to the use of other drugs.</p><p>‚ÄúBut in terms of us getting clear to use our resources to combat other major drugs, that‚Äôs a positive,‚Äù Riley said, noting that fentanyl alone accounts for more than 100,000 deaths in the U.S. a year.</p>
    

<p>On the other end of the spectrum, others argue marijuana should be treated the way alcohol is. </p><p>Last week, 21 Democrats led by Senate Majority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York sent a letter to DEA Administrator Anne Milgram and Attorney General Merrick Garland arguing marijuana should be dropped from the controlled-substances list and instead regulated like alcohol.</p><p>‚ÄúIt is time for the DEA to act,‚Äù the lawmakers wrote. ‚ÄúRight now, the Administration has the opportunity to resolve more than 50 years of failed, racially discriminatory marijuana policy.‚Äù</p><p>Federal drug policy has lagged behind many states in recent years, with 38 having already legalized medical marijuana and <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/ohio-marijuana-legalization-election-2023-6d15efb27fdcd41e7364f2b7cd3177f4">24 legalizing its recreational use</a></span>.</p><p>That‚Äôs helped fuel fast growth in the marijuana industry, with an estimated worth of nearly $30 billion. Easing federal regulations could reduce the tax burden that can be 70% or more for businesses, according to industry groups. It could also make it easier to research marijuana, since it‚Äôs very difficult to conduct authorized clinical studies on Schedule I substances.</p>
    

<p>The immediate effect of rescheduling on the nation‚Äôs criminal justice system would likely be more muted, since federal prosecutions for simple possession have been fairly rare in recent years. </p><p>But loosening restrictions could carry a host of unintended consequences in the drug war and beyond.</p><p>Critics point out that as a Schedule III drug, marijuana would remain regulated by the DEA. That means the roughly 15,000 cannabis dispensaries in the U.S. would have to register with the DEA like regular pharmacies and fulfill strict reporting requirements, something that they are loath to do and that the DEA is ill equipped to handle.</p>
    

<p>Then there‚Äôs the United States‚Äô international treaty obligations, chief among them the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, which requires the criminalization of cannabis. In 2016, during the Obama administration, the DEA cited the U.S.‚Äô international obligations and the findings of a federal court of appeals in Washington in denying a similar request to reschedule marijuana.</p><h2>___</h2><p>Goodman reported from Miami, Mustian from New Orleans.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p>Apr 30, 2024<!-- --> ¬∑ <!-- -->13 min read<!-- --> ¬∑ <!-- -->12<!-- --> views</p><p>I lived in SF for five years. Started companies in multiple countries in Europe. I invested in more than a hundred companies globally from Brazil to India. At this point I feel like I have a good comparison of different ecosystems.</p>
<p>Europe is special to me as I consider myself a proud European, but damn we need to talk.</p>
<p>I am equally extremely bull-ish on Europe and equally extremely bear-ish.</p>
<p>On one hand I believe we are on our clear path to fall from #1 to #4 in the world. On the other hand, I don't believe we are as doomed as people on US Twitter make us out to be.</p>
<p>Intentionally I don‚Äôt want to do Brussels or EU-ranting; I don‚Äôt want to do pure stats comparing or making speeches about the importance of robotics or AI, neither do I have the goal of suggesting outlandish changes. We need actionable improvements and fix how we think about Europe.</p>
<p>So, let‚Äôs go‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Here my POV:</p>
<h2>We started to believe US propaganda about Europe</h2>
<p>‚ÄúEuropeans lack the mentality and are risk averse‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt want to work as hard‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey favor work life balance‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey are constantly on vacation‚Äù</p>
<p>‚Äú‚Ä¶and that‚Äôs the reason they are losing‚Äù</p>
<p>None of these things are true.</p>
<p>Let me show you what i mean‚Ä¶</p>
<h3>‚ÄúEuropeans don‚Äôt work hard enough‚Äù</h3>
<p>Eastern Europeans work harder than Americans. Even Italians work more hours than Americans.</p>
<img src="https://klinger.io/images/eu-acc-work-times.png" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 95vw, 728px" loading="lazy" alt="hours worked" srcset="https://klinger.io/images/eu-acc-work-times-32w.png 32w, https://klinger.io/images/eu-acc-work-times-64w.png 64w, https://klinger.io/images/eu-acc-work-times-128w.png 128w, https://klinger.io/images/eu-acc-work-times-256w.png 256w, https://klinger.io/images/eu-acc-work-times-512w.png 512w, https://klinger.io/images/eu-acc-work-times-768w.png 768w, https://klinger.io/images/eu-acc-work-times-1024w.png 1024w, https://klinger.io/images/eu-acc-work-times-1536w.png 1536w, https://klinger.io/images/eu-acc-work-times-2048w.png 2048w">
<p>And based on my experience in the US, I honestly think that the US numbers are overstated.</p>
<p>US folks love <em><strong>talking</strong></em> about how hard they work. And honestly with service workers and blue collars I believe it. But not in tech.</p>
<p>In SF you frequently hear big tech people talking how hard they work, while they queue 30mins for a coffee at Blue Bottle and chitchatting there for another 20mins. You will get into a discussion in your WeWork about how much grit being a founder requires, an hour later you end up alone at 6pm on your floor. You will hear from founders how many late nights they need to pull, but with late nights, they mean investor dinners.</p>
<p><strong>Do American founders work hard? Yes definitely. But all founders do.</strong> That‚Äôs their job.</p>
<p>But Americans definitely <em><strong>love talking</strong></em> about how hard they work; way more than we do.</p>
<p>And let‚Äôs say for the argument I am wrong and we will believe all the numbers. The numbers aren‚Äôt that far off, even when compared to ‚Äúafter 6pm, please don‚Äôt talk to this employee or we sue you ja?! Germany‚Äù.</p>
<h3>‚ÄúEuropeans lack the risk mentality‚Äù</h3>
<p>Personally, I don‚Äôt believe it because I know that 1/5 of all <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/immigrant-founders-us-billion-dollar-companies/">US unicorn founders</a> are European. If they‚Äôd want to avoid risk so much why do so many go into so much risk to go to the US?</p>
<p>But this isn‚Äôt even my main pet-peeve. My main headache is: Let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs true. Let‚Äôs say Europeans are more risk averse‚Ä¶ <em><strong>Why?</strong></em> And more importantly why do we act <em><strong>as if we couldn‚Äôt change that?</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Mentality isn‚Äôt genetic</strong>. This isn‚Äôt hardwired into our bones or seeded into our water. This is an outcome of <strong>a system that favors being more careful.</strong></p>
<p>Failing in the EU has the same downside as in the US, but their upside is way bigger and more importantly the acceleration is way higher.</p>
<p><strong>If we improve the system the mentality improves</strong>. Don‚Äôt believe me?</p>
<p>Go to India.</p>
<p>The mindset of founders there switched from "i have to leave asap and nothing will ever change here" to "we are going to be one of the top three world powers and everyone should come here to start companies" in literally less than 10 years of strong economic growth and business success stories to follow.</p>
<p>Mentality is an outcome of a system. Let‚Äôs change the system. Make success more likely and people will believe that they can be successful.</p>
<h3>"They have a too comfortable life‚Ä¶ you need hardship to succeed"</h3>
<p>If it would be true that you need to come from hardship to succeed then US VCs wouldn‚Äôt fund every Stanford grad born with a silver spoon in their mouth.</p>
<p>Americans love their hero-arcs so much that people manage to spin anything into a ‚Äúcoming from nothing story‚Äù ‚Äì even if they got their first investments from their uncle and worked for free in the ‚Äúgarage‚Äù of their parents multi-million-dollar house in Palo Alto.</p>
<p>Yes, to start companies you need to grind. You will need to work hard, because if you don't someone else will. But needing the fear of existence over you to succeed is only true if you don't know about survivorship bias.</p>
<h3>‚ÄúThe Taxes are too high and people are not motivated because of this‚Äù</h3>
<p>Have you seen the Californian taxes? The EU isn‚Äôt far off. And btw you can easily pay ridiculously low taxes in Europe if you want to optimize for it. If you optimize for it, half the amount of US-taxes are easily doable in multiple European countries. And that‚Äôs without crazy optimizations yet.</p>
<p>If this was the only criteria everyone would flock to those tax optimized places in Europe.</p>
<h3>‚ÄúWell SF is better‚Äù</h3>
<p>I don‚Äôt disagree. SF is a unique place. We currently don‚Äôt try to get on the level of SF. We are trying not to fall behind China, India and random <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/pitchbook-global-vc-ecosystem-rankings">second- and third-degree hubs</a> in the US.</p>
<p>I highly recommend everyone in tech to move to SF once in their life. Learn and then come back and build their life‚Äôs work.</p>
<h3>So, here‚Äôs my POV: The problem in Europe isn‚Äôt taxes or mentality. It‚Äôs friction.</h3>
<p>What do you need to start a large company? Founders, ideas, customers, investors, etc etc. Sure.</p>
<p>But more importantly‚Ä¶</p>
<p>You need early acceleration. You need momentum towards your goal. You need traction.</p>
<p>You can think of this as customers, product insights, investor interest, networking success, etc.</p>
<p>You need <strong>early acceleration to reach escape velocity</strong>.</p>
<p>If <strong>every day is 1% harder</strong> for you than your competitor who will win? Your competitor. And in global markets where <strong>frequently 1-2 companies become the dominant player</strong> in a market this means you will not be a bit smaller. <strong>You will fight for scraps</strong>.</p>
<p>This is what‚Äôs happening right now in Europe.</p>
<p>The problem is not that regulation 1 or 100 is too much. The problem is that every country has different regulations, creating a mess of complexity if you want to act across a larger consumer market and make it impossible for standard solutions that remove early friction to emerge.</p>
<h2>So, what do we need to change</h2>
<p>First, we need to <strong>stop believing the US meme about Europe</strong>. And second, to do this we need a system where they are not true. To get there we need improvements.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt want to write a big speech about robotics, AI, climate, or space-tech. About ambition, tolerance for risk, or people who want to build outlandish ideas.</p>
<p>We‚Äôve got all of that already. We need to help them.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt want solutions that are ‚Äúone unified Europe under ABC‚Äôd rule‚Äù or ‚Äúcomplete control by Brussels‚Äù. I am looking for first steps and pragmatic solutions. Simple things that have impact over time, and more importantly we can build on top of.</p>
<p>Here are my two suggestions ‚Äì no big speech no big unreachable ideal goal ‚Äì two simple suggestions as a starting point and if you disagree with those, please really <em>really</em> explain to me why:</p>
<h3>1) We need an EU Inc ‚Äì desperately</h3>
<p>The US has its state Delaware as de facto standard for legal entities for startups.</p>
<p>When people say US Inc, they mean Delaware Inc.</p>
<p>This might sound like a small thing, but it has a lot of implications. With one fundament on which you can start establishing other standards on top of it.</p>
<p>Eg you can create standard documents like the YC <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/documents">SAFE</a> or even software like <a href="https://angellist.com/">AngelList</a> on top of that.</p>
<p><em>‚ÄúWell, we have similar documents for German GmbHs as well‚Ä¶‚Äù</em></p>
<p>Let me stop you right here.</p>
<p>I invest globally.</p>
<p>To invest in the EU I need to understand 30+ legal systems to make sure I am not tricked over by the small print, get lawyers and figure out if i need a notary. After that i need 10-20 emails each funding round to satisfy whatever random fun fact local countries came up now.</p>
<p>In the US I receive an email with a <a href="https://documenso.com/">document signing link</a> to a standard SAFE and can sign with one click. I don‚Äôt need to check the fine-print. I (and the founder) don‚Äôt need to involve lawyers.</p>
<p><em>‚ÄúBut if the deal is good enough it‚Äôs worth the effort‚Ä¶‚Äù</em></p>
<p>That‚Äôs not the reality of early stage investing. If someone invests $30k to help you they don‚Äôt want to spend another 10-15k on lawyers trying to figure out how legal details in Slovenian OODs work. Fun-fact there are no Slovenian OODs. Those are in Bulgaria, but I bet you knew that. Or was it SRL? BV? SpA? AB? SA? O√ú? UAB? EhF? Cheese how different can they be. I mean‚Ä¶ we will find out latest when a bigger investor wants to come in, and freak out about local differences right?</p>
<p><em>‚ÄúWell then one arrogant investor does not invest‚Ä¶ who cares.‚Äù</em> A portfolio company of mine had the best EdTech angel onboard. The best. In the world. People joined the round because of him. He jumped out of the round realizing the company is a GmbH and he knew this wouldn‚Äôt be done in the 2 weeks before xmas as an American investor. The follow-on investor was good. Would it have been better if they would had played on ‚Äúinternationally best investors approve this‚Äù level? Who knows.</p>
<p>Europe is a market of 750 million people, the EU of 450 million. And investing here is as complex as investing in small countries globally with sub 10 million people. Because that‚Äôs what it is.</p>
<p><em>‚ÄúBut there is <a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/business/running-business/developing-business/setting-up-european-company/index_en.htm">the SE</a>‚Ä¶ which is Europe-wide‚Äù</em></p>
<p>This is my argument not yours. The SE shows that it would be possible, but it‚Äôs not meant for startups. It‚Äôs not meant to be simple.</p>
<p><em>‚ÄúWell, you are just asking for this because you are an investor‚Ä¶‚Äù</em></p>
<p>I gave a talk about this more than 15 (gasp!) years ago while starting my first company. Investors don‚Äôt hate this. It limits the options for local founders, it‚Äôs overwhelming for people who don‚Äôt do it professionally like them, they can make sure they get low valuations and international investors are not used to stealing their deals.</p>
<p>Founders need this. Not investors. Investors make money on that opportunity arbitrage, even if it limits the overall upside.</p>
<p>Here is my Question: Why did we stop with ‚Äúsingle market‚Äù efforts? Why is there no effort to unify legal entity in Europe?</p>
<p>Investing in companies at an early stage should not involve surprises and friction. Those kill deals.</p>
<h3>2) Teach English starting at the earliest school classes</h3>
<p>This sounds too simple to be true.</p>
<p>But the reality is dire.</p>
<p>If you go to the south of France ‚Äì our hope and prayers in the global AI race ‚Äì and order a coffee there is a chance that the waitress doesn‚Äôt understand the word ‚Äúcoffee‚Äù, can‚Äôt explain you what‚Äôs in the salad ‚Äì happened to me twice. If you meet Italians there is a high chance that they had only 4-5 years of English at school.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt care if you think English should be Europe‚Äôs default language or not. Growing up generations in this age without being able to properly speak English limits their job opportunities. It‚Äôs a disgrace to those generations and limits them, isolates them.</p>
<p>You don‚Äôt lose your culture by creating options for your future generations.</p>
<p>And more importantly you enable proper EU-wide media and networks. When you launch in the US your market pull can come from any part of the US. In Europe we are a mess of patchy networks and no significant media reaches across it.</p>
<p>Teach English. Seriously. Why is this even a discussion.</p>
<h2>That‚Äôs it.</h2>
<p>That‚Äôs it. Those are my two suggestions.</p>
<p>No big speeches no big rants. Two simple actionable first goals for politicians to decide if they are against or for it.</p>
<h2>Why not a big ask?</h2>
<p>Whenever you bring up a discussion about Europe people fear for their cultural identity. Let‚Äôs sidestep this. The goal is not one big unified completely homogenous Europe.</p>
<p>The goal is to have one single market for business where you don‚Äôt feel like you are expanding into far away foreign lands whenever you do business across your border. A single market where international players compete with local ones to get the best outcomes for everyone involved.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm sorry to keep ringing the bell of standards instead of doing a big chant around ‚Äúbravery‚Äù ‚Äúrobotics‚Äù, ‚ÄúAI‚Äù and ‚Äúinnovation‚Äù.</p>
<p>All of those things come automatically if you remove friction and show examples to people.</p>
<h3>Regulating vs Standardizing?</h3>
<p>The main thinking behind it is a simple one. I want to get away from a mindset of ‚Äúregulating‚Äù to a mindset of ‚Äústandardization‚Äù.</p>
<p>Standards that can become fundaments for further standards. EU-wide solutions for EU-wide problems.</p>
<h3>You can productize on top of standards - and we are far behind</h3>
<p>I mentioned <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/documents">YC SAFE</a> notes and companies like <a href="https://angellist.com/">AngelList</a> above. Those one-click abstractions of legal standards are great. But this isn‚Äôt the state of the art.</p>
<p>We are far behind with the state of the art. I highly recommend you learning about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZDBHKhWw4">India‚Äôs DPI</a> (digital public infrastructure) efforts. Nation-wide eKYC (with 1.4B people), cardless commission-free payments with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Payments_Interface">UPI</a> that is already at 1/4 of VISA‚Äôs volume, decentralized marketplaces like <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ONDC&amp;oq=ONDC&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIGCAEQRRg8MgYIAhAuGEDSAQgxNDIyajBqMagCALACAA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">ODNC</a> that allow small businesses to work with larger customers, nation-wide credit/loan marketplaces with <a href="https://ocen.dev/">OCEN</a>.</p>
<p>India isn‚Äôt only tackling their biggest problems with standardization; they build products on top of it. Products like protocols that entrepreneurs can take and build solutions on-top.</p>
<p><em>‚ÄúBut india is one country‚Ä¶‚Äù</em> Yes but a few years ago you‚Äôd have dismissed anything coming from them as being a developing country. Now that it‚Äôs working, it‚Äôs reframed as easy because they ‚Äúare one country‚Äù</p>
<p><em>‚ÄúBut we lack the knowhow‚Ä¶‚Äù</em> We don‚Äôt. Estonia has consulted with India on those projects. We have the knowhow. We lack the willingness to do European-wide solutions.</p>
<p>I got more‚Ä¶ but I think this is a start. Intentionally a simple one.</p>
<p>Let me know</p>
<p>Do you disagree?</p>
<p>Should we not have an EU-wide entity that is simple and can be implemented everywhere?</p>
<p>Should we not teach our kids English starting as early as possible in school?</p>
<p>I think those are simple first steps with large systematic impacts over time.</p>
<p>eu/acc - let‚Äôs go</p></article></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://opentofu.org/blog/opentofu-1-7-0/">https://opentofu.org/blog/opentofu-1-7-0/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40212617">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__blog-post-container" itemprop="articleBody"><p>In the last few months <a href="https://opentofu.org/blog/opentofu-is-going-ga/">since our first stable release</a> the OpenTofu community and the core team have worked hand in hand to bring functionality to OpenTofu that has been requested for years.  We are proud to announce the immediate availability of <a href="https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/releases/tag/v1.7.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenTofu 1.7.0</a>, bringing you the following highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://opentofu.org/docs/intro/whats-new/#state-encryption"><strong>End-to-end state encryption</strong></a> protects your state file from prying eyes, no matter what storage backend you use. You can provide your encryption passphrase securely using environment variables, or use a key management system such as AWS KMS, GCP KMS, or OpenBao. <em>This feature has been developed in collaboration with Stephan Bartels (Interhyp) and Alex Scheel from the OpenTofu community, whom we would like to thank for their work on this feature.</em></li>
<li><a href="https://opentofu.org/docs/intro/whats-new/#provider-defined-functions"><strong>Dynamic provider-defined functions</strong></a> let a provider not only provide resources, but also native functions you can use in your OpenTofu code. What's more, we added an OpenTofu-only feature to let providers dynamically define custom functions based on your configuration. This enhancement allows you to fully integrate other programming languages as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OXBv0MYalY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shown in our live stream</a>. You can try out this functionality with our experimental <a href="https://github.com/opentofu/terraform-provider-lua" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lua</a> and <a href="https://github.com/opentofu/terraform-provider-go" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Go</a> providers.</li>
<li><a href="https://opentofu.org/docs/intro/whats-new/#removed-block"><strong>The removed block</strong></a> lets you mark OpenTofu-created resources for removal from the state file, but still keep the infrastructure you created.</li>
<li><a href="https://opentofu.org/docs/intro/whats-new/#loopable-import-blocks"><strong>Loopable import blocks</strong></a> let you bulk-import resources declaratively in your OpenTofu code, helping with large-scale migrations.</li>
</ul>
<p>As with the previous version, OpenTofu remains a drop-in replacement for its predecessor Terraform‚Ñ¢ 1.5 and has easy migration paths from later versions. Check out the overhauled <a href="https://opentofu.org/docs/intro/migration/"><strong>migration guides</strong></a> for detailed migration instructions. You can find the full list of changes and comprehensive examples <a href="https://opentofu.org/docs/intro/whats-new/">in the documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Since the first release, the OpenTofu community and adoption have been growing significantly. While we don't believe in tracking our users and don't have accurate numbers, we have seen a constant month-over-month growth in our registry usage since our launch only 4 months ago. Over just the last month our registry usage has more than doubled to well over a million requests per day.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="A graph showing OpenTofu&amp;#39;s registry usage." src="https://opentofu.org/assets/images/opentofu-registry-april-2024-f9521461bf6bc2583f816431afb75c9f.svg" width="1542" height="620"></p>
<p>Additionally, we had 65 unique contributors for this release alone and have recently reached 20,000 stars on GitHub. Since January, we have seen our community spread the word about OpenTofu, open over 200 new issues and file even more pull requests.</p>

<p>If you are new to OpenTofu, welcome! We started as a fork of HashiCorp's Terraform‚Ñ¢ after its license was changed to the restrictive BUSL alongside a frequently changing licensing FAQ. OpenTofu is an infrastructure-as-code tool that lets you declaratively create cloud infrastructure with thousands of APIs by writing your own code or using one of the tens of thousands of community-provided modules.</p>
<p>For example, you could create an EC2 instance on AWS like this:</p>
<div><figure><figcaption>Code Block</figcaption><pre tabindex="0" role="code" aria-label="Code Block"><code><span><span>resource </span><span>"aws_instance"</span><span> </span><span>"web"</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>  </span><span>ami</span><span>           </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"add AMI ID here"</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>  </span><span>instance_type</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"t3.micro"</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>}</span><br></span></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>OpenTofu's main advantage is that it records any changes to your cloud infrastructure in a state file, which allows it to later modify the same infrastructure, or tear it down if you created it as a test.</p>

<p>OpenTofu is first and foremost a community-driven project. We are looking forward to the continued tradition of working on issues the community deems important. For transparency and to encourage everyone to vote, we have created <a href="https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/issues/1496" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a list of the most upvoted issues</a>.</p>
<p>While much of OpenTofu 1.8 is still in planning, we are currently finalizing a proposal for a feature that lets you <a href="https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/issues/1042" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">use variables as module sources, backend configuration, and more</a>. Early evaluation of variables has been requested in over 30 issues so far and is one of the most-requested features in OpenTofu.</p>
<p>If you have a feature you would like to see in OpenTofu, please don't hesitate to <a href="https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/issues/new/choose" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open an issue</a> or <a href="https://opentofu.org/slack/">reach out to us on Slack</a>.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://pyinfra.com/">https://pyinfra.com/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40211655">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
            <article id="content">
                <p>pyinfra automates infrastructure using Python. It‚Äôs fast and scales from one server to thousands. Great for ad-hoc command execution, service deployment, configuration management and more. Here's why you should try pyinfra:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>üöÄ <strong>Super fast</strong> execution over thousands of targets with predictable performance.</li>
                <li>üö® <strong>Instant debugging</strong> with realtime stdin/stdout/stderr output (<code>-vvv</code>).</li>
                <li>üîÑ <strong>Idempotent operations</strong> that enable diffs and dry runs before making changes.</li>
                <li>üì¶ <strong>Extendable</strong> with the entire Python package ecosystem.</li>
                <li>üíª <strong>Agentless execution</strong> against anything with shell access.</li>
                <li>üîå <strong>Integrated</strong> with connectors for Docker, Terraform, Vagrant and more.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><img src="https://pyinfra.com/static/example_deploy.gif" title="" width="100%"></p>

                <h2>Quickstart</h2>


                <p>Install pyinfra with <code>pip</code>:</p>
                


                <p>Now you can execute commands over SSH:</p>
                <div><pre>pyinfra my-server.net <span>exec</span> -- <span>echo</span> <span>"hello world"</span></pre></div>


                <p>Or target Docker, the local machine, and other <a href="https://docs.pyinfra.com/page/connectors.html">connectors</a>:</p>
                <div><pre>pyinfra @docker/ubuntu <span>exec</span> -- <span>echo</span> <span>"Hello world"</span>
pyinfra @local <span>exec</span> -- <span>echo</span> <span>"Hello world"</span></pre></div>


                <p>As well as executing commands you can define state using <a href="https://docs.pyinfra.com/page/operations.html">operations</a>:</p>
                <div><pre>pyinfra @docker/ubuntu apt.packages iftop <span>update</span><span>=</span><span>true </span><span>_sudo</span><span>=</span><span>true</span></pre></div>


                <p>Which can then be saved as a Python file like <code>deploy.py</code>:</p>
                <div><pre><span>from</span> <span>pyinfra.operations</span> <span>import</span> <span>apt</span>

<span>apt</span><span>.</span><span>packages</span><span>(</span>
    <span>name</span><span>=</span><span>"Ensure iftop is installed"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>packages</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>"iftop"</span><span>],</span>
    <span>update</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>,</span>
    <span>_sudo</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>,</span>
<span>)</span></pre></div>


                <p>And executed:</p>
                <div><pre>pyinfra @docker/ubuntu deploy.py</pre></div>

                <p>Now you know the building blocks of pyinfra! By combining inventory, operations and Python code you can deploy anything.</p>

<p>Just after laying off ‚Äúmore than 10%‚Äù of its global workforce, Tesla is laying off even more employees ‚Äì&nbsp;including senior executives and long-time veterans of the company, most notably the entire Supercharging team and the executive responsible for negotiating NACS adoption across the industry.</p>



<p>Tesla started the week before last with news of a <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/04/15/tesla-lays-off-more-than-10-of-its-global-workforce/">huge round of layoffs</a>.</p>



<p>The layoffs were quite broad across the company. Tesla <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/autos/tesla-tells-cybertruck-employees-shifts-230912810.html">shortened production shifts at Gigafactory Texas</a> and <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/04/15/tesla-heads-rolling-critical-projects-gigafactory-texas/">cleared out several teams associated with critical projects there</a>.</p>



<p>One of those heads was <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/04/15/tesla-top-engineering-executive-drew-baglino-leaves-leadership-loss/">Drew Baglino, former VP of Powertrain and Energy Engineering</a>, who had been with the company for 18 years and led the 4680 cell project. While his resignation is being publicly portrayed as voluntary, it is speculated that disappointment with progress on the 4680 project had something to do with it.</p>



<p>Tesla also lost key executive <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/04/15/teslas-head-policy-business-dev-leaves/">Rohan Patel</a>, its head of policy and business development, during these layoffs.</p>



<p>And as we learned last week, the company also <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/04/22/tesla-fired-its-entire-new-ad-team-in-recent-layoffs/">fired its entire new ad team</a>.</p>



<p>But <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/04/14/tesla-rumor-massive-round-layoffs/">when we originally heard about Tesla‚Äôs upcoming layoffs</a>, the rumors we heard suggested that the numbers could involve up to 20% of the company‚Äôs workforce. We had <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/03/22/tesla-tsla-stock-drops-report-reducing-ev-output-giga-shanghai/">seen</a> <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/02/07/tesla-appears-preparing-round-of-layoffs/">other</a> <a href="https://electrek.co/2023/12/20/tesla-removes-stock-based-compensation-this-year-report/">signals</a> that layoffs might be coming, but the specific tip came from an anonymous source within Tesla who was correct about the layoff‚Äôs timing, though not correct about its scale.</p>



<p>Now, more layoffs have been finalized through an email from CEO Elon Musk to executives, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/musk-plans-more-layoffs-as-two-senior-tesla-executives-depart?rc=x5svxc">first reported by The Information</a>, stating that 6-year veteran Rebecca Tinucci, Tesla‚Äôs Senior Director of EV charging, would be leaving the company on Tuesday, along with nearly all of her 500-person charging team (‚Äúa few‚Äù employees will be reassigned to other teams, according to The Information).</p>



<p>Tinucci was responsible for Tesla‚Äôs EV charging business, including Supercharging, which means that the cutting of the Supercharger team may reflect a change in direction for Tesla. Tesla has been very successful at getting manufacturers to adopt its NACS plug ‚Äì&nbsp;an effort led by Tinucci, which <a href="https://time.com/collection/time100-climate/6333178/rebecca-tinucci/">got her onto the TIME 100 Climate list</a> and <a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/2024-motortrend-power-list/">#2 on Motor Trend‚Äôs auto industry power list </a>‚Äì leading many to suggest that it will be able to run a profitable energy delivery business for a long time to come (here‚Äôs <a href="https://youtu.be/Hl1zEzVUV7w?t=5740">her presentation from Investor Day 2023</a>).</p>



<p>The email states that Tesla will continue to build out some new Superchargers, and will finish those under construction. But relieving the team of its duty may signal a reduction in buildout of the system ‚Äì at a time when, if anything, <a href="https://electrek.co/2023/01/09/heres-how-many-ev-chargers-the-us-has-and-how-many-it-needs/">faster charging station deployment is needed</a>.</p>



<p>Another executive layoff is 10-year veteran Daniel Ho, Director of Vehicle Programs and New Product Initiatives, who was program manager for the Model S, 3 and Y and had previously served 12 years at Ford in product roles.</p>



<p>In recent quarters, Tesla has guided for a ‚Äúpause‚Äù inbetween growth phases, expecting that sales growth would be more modest until the release of next-gen vehicles like the&nbsp;cheaper ‚ÄúModel 2‚Äù and <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/04/05/tesla-robotaxi-unveiling-august-8/">robotaxi</a> products. There has been some <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/04/05/elon-musk-shuts-down-report-tesla-scrapping-25000-model-2-electric-car/">back</a>‚Äì<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/04/05/elon-musk-shuts-down-report-tesla-scrapping-25000-model-2-electric-car/">and</a>‚Äì<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/04/23/tesla-announces-change-of-plans-to-build-cheaper-electric-cars/">forth</a> over what form those products would take ‚Äì&nbsp;but laying off the head of New Product Initiatives reflects potential problems within that team as well.</p>



<p>Further, most of former executive Rohan Patel‚Äôs public policy team will be eliminated ‚Äì&nbsp;at a time when many public policy challenges around DC charging, home charging, emissions standards, climate change, and political hostility to superior EV technology are still looming.</p>



<p>Musk said, in his typical bluster, that he wants Tesla to be ‚Äúabsolutely hard core‚Äù about headcount reduction, saying that executives whose subordinates ‚Äúdon‚Äôt obviously pass the excellent, necessary and trustworthy test‚Äù would find themselves relieved of duty as well&nbsp;‚Äì suggesting that he wants those executives to fire more employees or be fired themselves.</p>



<p>All of this news comes at a critical time for Tesla, following a&nbsp;<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/04/23/tesla-tsla-q1-2024-results/">quarterly earnings miss</a>&nbsp;in which Tesla significantly missed delivery and earnings estimates, and had a rare year-over-year reduction in sales</p>



<p>Tesla‚Äôs layoffs come at a time when many other companies in the tech industry are laying off staff, in an apparent game of follow-the-leader while&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-quarterly-earnings-feature-big-growth-tech-related-companies-2024-04-11/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">industry profits are still high</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-electrek-s-take">Electrek‚Äôs Take</h2>



<p>Firstly ‚Äì it makes absolutely no sense to lay off the Supercharger team. Supercharging is an incredible opportunity for Tesla, especially now that everyone else has adopted NACS.</p>



<p>Tesla has a fairly simple business case from here on out to become the leading ‚Äúgas station of the future.‚Äù With its experience and lead on Superchargers, its more reliable and better-designed stations, and its existing business footprint with so many stations installed around the globe, the company has a natural lead. This business case is even stronger now that the entire industry is behind NACS.</p>



<p>To lay off that whole team just when the company has earned such a big win, when billions in public money is available for buildout (which would not have been available without industry NACS adoption, which was, again, spearheaded by Tinucci‚Äôs negotiations), and when there is a lead to be maintained, is absolutely crazy. This move, alone, would erode any confidence I had left in Tesla‚Äôs CEO ‚Äì if I still had any.</p>




	<p>On layoffs in general, we noted in <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/04/15/tesla-lays-off-more-than-10-of-its-global-workforce/">our coverage of Tesla‚Äôs layoffs</a> that the worst part about situations like this is that they greatly affect morale. We imagine morale can‚Äôt be great within Tesla right now after huge layoffs, but there can at least be a sense of relief that they‚Äôre over after a large round of layoffs closes.</p>



<p>But if Tesla is still doing layoffs, that sense of relief is gone, and employees will still be wondering whether they might show up to work without a job, as we heard happened to many employees on the first day of layoffs.</p>



<p>And while the last layoffs were distasteful enough, continued layoffs have even worse optics, given Tesla‚Äôs move to <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/04/17/tesla-asks-shareholders-move-texas-and-re-pass-elon-musk-compensation-plan/">ask shareholders for a $55 billion payout for its CEO</a> just days after firing 14,000 people. That $55 billion could pay for <em>40 years</em> worth of six-figure salaries for those employees. Quite a large payday for a <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/04/22/elon-musk-pigeon-ceo-former-tesla-manager/">part-time CEO</a>, made worse by the potential loss of livelihood for more employees who might still be on the chopping block.</p>



<p>Speculatively, there may even be more layoffs coming. A source who was correct about coming layoffs but not exactly correct about their scale or timing told us that potentially another 5% of staff could be laid off, including executives and long-time employees dating back to the Roadster days. These layoffs seem close to that rumor (though, again, on a smaller scale), but it‚Äôs possible that there may be more coming. Watch this space for news.</p>

     NAME
          gb, gba, nes, snes - emulators

     SYNOPSIS
          games/gb [ -acd ] [ -C ... ] [ -x scale ] [ -li addr ]
          romfile
          games/gba [ -a ] [ -b biosfile ] [ -s savetype ] [ -g
          gpiotype ] [ -x scale ] romfile
          games/nes [ -aos ] [ -x scale ] romfile
          games/snes [ -ahms ] [ -x scale ] romfile

     DESCRIPTION
          Gb, gba, nes and snes are emulators for the Nintendo Game
          Boy and Game Boy Color (GB and GBC), Nintendo Game Boy
          Advance (GBA), Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), and
          Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES).  They execute
          the romfile given as an argument.  The z, x, a, s, q, w,
          return and shift keys correspond to B, A, Y, X, L1, L2,
          Start and Select, respectively.  Other keys:

          F1   Pause the emulator. If already paused it will step one
               video frame.

          F5   Save the current state in gb.save / gba.save / nes.save
               / snes.save.

          F6   Load the current state from gb.save / gba.save /
               nes.save / snes.save.

          F12  Toggle the emulator's speedometer.  It shows in the
               upper left, off-viewport corner, the ratio between the
               expected and observed time it took to draw 60 frames.

          t    Toggle tracing of the emulator.

          `    It uncaps the 60fps frame rate and lets emulation go as
               fast as possible.

          Esc  Pause the emulator.

          Del  Exit the emulator.

          Command line options:

          -a   Enable audio output.

          -x   Scale the screen to a given factor regardless of the
               window's size.

          gb options:

     <a href="http://man.9front.org/1/NINTENDO">NINTENDO(1)</a>                                           <a href="http://man.9front.org/1/NINTENDO">NINTENDO(1)</a>

          -c   Run GBC roms in GBC mode and DMG (GB) roms in GBC's DMG
               compatibility mode.

          -d   Run GB roms in DMG mode. GBC-only roms will not run in
               this mode; others will run only in black &amp; white.

          -Cnnnnnn,nnnnnn,nnnnnn,nnnnnn
               Select a color palette. Has no effect on roms in color
               mode. The syntax is of the form -C
               ffffff,aaaaaa,555555,000000 (using HTML style rrggbb
               notation).

          -liaddr
               These enable serial port connectivity emulation using
               the network. The -l flag configures the listening part-
               ner, whereas -i configures the dialing partner. The
               connection is established before the rom starts.  Com-
               munication is synchronous, emulation will stall while
               waiting for the other partner.

          gba options:

          -b   Location of the GBA BIOS file (required to operate the
               emulator). Default is /sys/games/lib/gbabios.bin.

          -s   Save format used by the original game. Valid formats
               are: eeprom4, eeprom64, sram256, flash512, flash1024.
               The number corresponds to the size, in kilobits, of the
               save file. By default, the emulator attempts to auto-
               matically detect the save format, but does not always
               succeed.  Some roms require a specific flash device id
               which may need to be set manually for them to work.
               Valid formats and corresponding ids are: flash512
               (SST), flash512mx (Macronix 64K), flash512pan (Pana-
               sonic), flash512atm (Atmel), flash1024 (Macronix 128K),
               flash1024san (Sanyo).

          -g   GPIO hardware used by the original game. The only valid
               type currently is rtc (real time clock).  By default,
               the emulator attempts to automatically detect the GPIO
               hardware using the game code found in the rom header.

          nes options:

          -o   Hide the top and bottom eight pixels (overscan area),
               like a real television would.

          -s   Save contents of battery backed SRAM (used by some
               games for savegames) as a file (gb and snes automati-
               cally detect if this is needed).

          snes options:

     <a href="http://man.9front.org/1/NINTENDO">NINTENDO(1)</a>                                           <a href="http://man.9front.org/1/NINTENDO">NINTENDO(1)</a>

          -h   Override HiROM/LoROM detection: -h sets LoROM, -hh sets
               HiROM.

          -m   Enable mouse emulation using system mouse. Mouse button
               1 (left button) engages the SNES left mouse button.
               Mouse button 3 (right button) engages the SNES right
               mouse button. Holding down mouse button 2 (middle but-
               ton) disengages the SNES mouse entirely so that the
               Plan 9 cursor offset can be adjusted to align with the
               SNES cursor.

          Each of these emulators support the use of joysticks via
          <a href="http://man.9front.org/1/joy">joy(1)</a>. Nes also supports selecting the joystick for either
          player 1 or 2.

     BUGS
          You bet!
          SRAM saving on the NES only functions when the -s option is
          used.
          The SNES horizontal hires mode is supported only with -2
          scaling.
          All emulators assume a North American (i.e. NTSC) system.
          PAL games (and in some cases Japanese games) are not sup-
          ported.
          The serial link emulation has issues with desynchronization
          in timing dependent scenarios.

<!-- cache hit 492:single/related:76687c0f5dc9de270e9d2617cc213305 --><!-- empty -->
<p>Starting in March with the release of iOS 17.4, iPhones in the European Union have been subject to the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA), a batch of regulations that (among other things) forced Apple to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/apple-announces-sweeping-eu-app-store-policy-changes-including-sideloading/">support alternate app stores</a>, app sideloading, and third-party browser engines in iOS for the first time. Today, EU regulators announced that they are also categorizing Apple's iPadOS as a "gatekeeper," meaning that the iPad will soon be subject to the same regulations as the iPhone.</p>

<p>The EU began investigating whether iPadOS would qualify as a gatekeeper in September 2023, the same day it decided that iOS, the Safari browser, and the App Store were all gatekeepers.</p>
<p>"Apple now has six months to ensure full compliance of iPadOS with the DMA obligations," <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_24_2363">reads</a> the EU's blog post about the change.</p>
<p>Apple technically split the iPad's operating system from the iPhone's in 2019 when it began calling its tablet operating system "iPadOS" instead of iOS. But practically speaking, little separates the two operating systems under the hood. Both iOS and iPadOS share the same software build numbers, they're updated in lockstep (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/08/facing-quality-and-pacing-issues-apple-reportedly-delays-ipados-16/#:~:text=Apple%20will%20delay%20the%20release,with%20knowledge%20of%20the%20matter.">with rare exceptions</a>), and most importantly for DMA compliance purposes, they pull software from the same locked-down App Store with the same Apple-imposed restrictions in place.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Apps distributed through alternate app stores or third-party websites will have to abide by many of Apple's rules and will still generally be limited to using Apple's public APIs. However, the ability to use alternate app stores and browser engines on the iPad's large screen (and the desktop-class M-series chips) could make the tablets better laptop replacements by allowing them to do more of the things that Mac users can do on their systems.</p>
<p>Though Apple has made multiple changes to iOS in the EU to comply with the DMA, EU regulators <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/03/apple-google-and-meta-are-failing-dma-compliance-eu-suspects/">are already investigating Apple</a> (as well as Google and Meta) for "non-compliance." Depending on the results of that investigation, the EU may require Apple to make more changes to the way it allows third-party apps to be installed in iOS and to the way that third-party developers are allowed to advertise non-Apple app store and payment options. Any changes that Apple makes to iOS to comply with the investigation's findings will presumably trickle down to the iPad as well.</p>
<p>Of course, none of this directly affects US-based iPhone or iPad users, whose devices remain restricted to Apple's app stores and the WebKit browsing engine. That said, we have seen some recent App Store rule changes that have arguably trickled down from Apple's attempts to comply with the DMA, most notably <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/apple-now-allows-retro-game-emulators-on-its-app-store-but-with-big-caveats/">policy changes</a> that have allowed (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/why-a-gamecube-wii-emulator-may-not-be-possible-on-the-ios-app-store/">some, not all</a>) retro game console emulators <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/a-touchscreen-of-nostalgia-delta-brings-classic-nintendo-consoles-to-ios/">into the App Store for the first time</a>.</p>

<h2 id="introduction"><span>1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>Every SQL database engine works in roughly the same way:  It first 
translates the input SQL text into a "prepared statement".  Then it "executes"
the prepared statement to generate a result.

</p><p>A prepared statement is an object that represents the steps needed
accomplish the input SQL.  Or, to think of it in another way,
the prepared statement is the SQL statement translated into a form that is
more easily understood by the computer.

</p><p>In SQLite, a prepared statement is an instance of the
<a href="https://sqlite.org/draft/c3ref/stmt.html">sqlite3_stmt object</a>.  In other systems, the prepared
statement is usually an internal data structure that is not directly visible to
the application programmer.  Developers of other SQL database engines
do not necessary call these objects "prepared statements".
But such objects exists, whatever they might be called.
This paper will use the term "prepared statement".

</p><p>There are countless ways of implementing a prepared statement.  This
paper will look at the two most common methods:

</p><ol>
<li><p>
<b>Bytecode</b> ‚Üí  The input SQL is translated into a virtual machine language
that is then run by a virtual machine interpreter.  This is the technique
used by SQLite.

</p></li><li><p>
<b>Tree-Of-Objects</b> ‚Üí The input SQL is translated in a tree of objects
that represent the processing to be done.  The SQL is executed by walking this
tree.  This is the technique used by MySQL and PostgreSQL.
</p></li></ol>

<p>
There are advantages and disadvantages to each of these representations of
a prepared statement.  The purpose of this paper is to articulate some of those
advantages and disadvantages.

</p><h2 id="how_to_provide_feedback"><span>1.1. </span>How To Provide Feedback</h2>

<p>
This document is written from the perspective of the original author of SQLite.
If you disagree with any of the opinions offered in this document, you are
welcomed to offer corrections and/or contrary views on the
<a href="https://sqlite.org/forum">SQLite Forum</a>.  Or you can email the author
directly.

</p><h2 id="definition_of_bytecode_"><span>1.2. </span>Definition Of "Bytecode"</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://sqlite.org/draft/opcode.html">bytecode generated by SQLite</a> might be a little different from what
many readers think of as bytecode.  The bytecode used (for example) by the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine">Java virtual machine</a> or
by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly">WebAssembly</a> consists almost
entirely of low-level operations, similar to what physical CPUs implement:
basic math operators, comparisons, conditional jumps, and
instructions to move content between different memory locations.  SQLite bytecode
has these kinds of low-level instructions, too.  But SQLite bytecode also contains
some high-level operations that are specific to the needs of a database engine.
Here are just a few examples:

</p><ul>
<li><p><b>OP_Column</b> ‚Üí Extract the value from the N-th column of the
database row that a particular cursor is currently pointing at.
</p></li><li><p><b>OP_CreateBtree</b> ‚Üí Allocate space for a new B-Tree in the
database file.
</p></li><li><p><b>OP_ParseSchema</b> ‚Üí Reread and reparse all or part of the the 
<a href="https://sqlite.org/draft/schematab.html">sqlite_schema table</a> and refresh internal symbol tables accordingly.
</p></li><li><p><b>OP_SeekGE</b> ‚Üí Move a cursor on a particular B-Tree to the first
entry that is greater than or equal to a given key.
</p></li><li><p><b>OP_Next</b> ‚Üí Advance a cursor on a particular B-Tree to the next
entry in the B-Tree and jump, or fall through if there are no more entries in that
B-Tree.
</p></li></ul>

<p>In other words, the "bytecode" used by SQLite is not so much a set of CPU
instructions as it is a list of database primitives that are to be run
in a particular order.

</p><h2 id="definition_of_abstract_syntax_tree_or_ast_"><span>1.3. </span>Definition Of "Abstract Syntax Tree" or "AST"</h2>

<p>
An "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">Abstract Syntax Tree</a>" or AST
is a data structure that describes a program or statement in some kind of formal
language.  In our context, the formal language is SQL.  An AST is typically
implemented as a tree of objects where each object represents one small part of
the overall SQL statement.  ASTs emerge naturally from parsers for formal languages.
The usual technique is to use an 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LALR_parser">LALR(1) parser</a>.
With such a parser, each terminal
symbol holds metadata that will become a leaf of the AST, and each non-terminal 
symbol holds metadata that will become a sub-branch of the overall AST.
As rules of the grammar are "reduced" by the parser, new nodes of the AST are
allocated and connected to subnodes.
After the parse completes, the start-symbol of the grammar is left holding the
root of the AST.

</p><p>An AST is a tree of objects.  But an AST is not a suitable form for
a prepared statement.  After being generated, an AST first needs to be
transformed in various ways before it can executed.  Symbols need to be
resolved.  Semantic rules need to be checked.  Optimizations need to be
applied that transform input SQL statement into different forms that
execute more quickly.  Finally, the AST needs to be translated into an
alternative representation that is more amenable to execution.

</p><p>Some people refer to the tree of objects that is used as the
executable form for MySQL and PostgreSQL as an AST.  The is probably a
misuse of the term "AST", because by the time the tree of objects is
ready to be executed, it has been changed so much that it has little
resemblance to the original SQL text.  The confusion arises in part because
both the final prepared statement object and the original AST are both
trees of objects.  The usual technique is for the original AST that comes
directly out of the parser to be transformed little by little, in multiple
passes, until at the end it is fully converted into an tree of objects
that is no longer strictly an AST but that can be evaluated to
generate a result.  There is not necessarily a clear point during this
process when the tree-of-objects ceases to be an AST and becomes a
prepared statement instead.  And because there is no clear boundary between an
AST and a prepared statement, people often refer to a prepared statement
that is represented as a tree of objects as an "AST", even though that
description is not precise.

</p><h2 id="dataflow_programming"><span>1.4. </span>Dataflow Programming</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow_programming">Dataflow programming</a>
is a style of programming in which individual nodes specialize in doing
one small part of the overall computation.  Each node receives inputs from 
other nodes and sends its output to other nodes.  Thus the nodes form a
directed graph that carry inputs into outputs.

</p><p>
A "dataflow program" is perhaps a better description than "AST" for
the tree of objects that an SQL database engine uses as a prepared statement.

</p><h2 id="advantages_to_compiling_into_bytecode"><span>2. </span>Advantages To Compiling Into Bytecode</h2>

<p>SQLite compiles to bytecode, and the SQLite developers are very happy
with this approach.  Here is why:

</p><h2 id="bytecode_is_easier_to_understand"><span>2.1. </span>Bytecode Is Easier To Understand</h2>

<p>A flat list of opcodes can be easily printed to see exactly
how an SQL statement is being implemented.  This is what happens in SQLite
when you preface an SQL statement with the "EXPLAIN" keyword:  Instead of
actually running the SQL, the result is a listing of the bytecode
that would have been used to implement that SQL.

</p><p>Bytecode lends itself to this because a bytecode program is easily
represented as a table.  In SQLite bytecode, each instruction
has one opcode and five operands.  Thus a prepared statement can be
rendered as if it were a query against a six-column table.

</p><p>A tree-of-objects representation is more difficult to publish in
a human-readable form.  The objects that comprise the tree tend to
all be very different, and thus it is tricky to come up with a 
consistent and simple table representation with which to display
the objects.  Any any such table representation that you do come up
with would almost certainly have more than six column, probably many more.
The problem of rendering a tree-of-objects as a table is sufficiently
difficult that nobody does it, as far as I know.  Hence, no
tree-of-objects database engine provides the level
of detail in their "EXPLAIN" output that SQLite provides.

</p><h2 id="bytecode_is_easier_to_debug"><span>2.2. </span>Bytecode Is Easier To Debug</h2>

<p>Bytecode represents a clear separation between front-end parsing and
analyze and back-end evaluation of an SQL statement.  When problems arise
(incorrect answers and/or poor performance), the developers can examine
the bytecode to quickly isolate the source of the trouble to either the
front-end analysis or the back-end data storage sections of the product.

</p><p>In debugging builds of SQLite, the <a href="https://sqlite.org/draft/pragma.html#pragma_vdbe_trace">PRAGMA vdbe_trace=ON;</a> command will
cause a trace of the bytecode execution to appear on the console.

</p><h2 id="bytecode_can_be_run_incrementally"><span>2.3. </span>Bytecode Can Be Run Incrementally</h2>

<p>
SQL statements written in bytecode can be evaluated incrementally.
For example, a statement can be run until it generates just its first
row of output.  The statement then pauses until it is stepped again.
It is not necessary to run the statement to completion before examining
the first row of output.

</p><p>
This is more difficult to achieve in a tree-of-objects design.  When
the prepared statement is a tree-of-objects, execution is normally
accomplished by walking the tree.  To pause the statement in the middle
of a computation means unwinding the stack back up to the caller, all
the while saving enough state to resume evaluation where it last left
off.  This is not impossible to do, but it is sufficiently difficult that
I have never seen it actually done.

</p><p>
Most SQL database engines do not really need to do incremental
execution of prepared statements because most SQL database engines
are client/server.  In a client/server engines, a single SQL statement is sent
to the server, then the complete reply comes back over the wire
all at once.  Thus each statement runs to completion in a single go.
But SQLite is not client/server.  SQLite is a library
that runs in the same address space and using the same stack as the
application.  Being able to easily and reliably perform incremental
execution of an SQL statement is important to SQLite.

</p><h2 id="bytecode_is_smaller"><span>2.4. </span>Bytecode Is Smaller</h2>

<p>
The bytecode generated by SQLite is usually smaller than the corresponding
AST coming out of the parser.  During initial processing of SQL text
(during the call to <a href="https://sqlite.org/draft/c3ref/prepare.html">sqlite3_prepare()</a> and similar) both the AST and the
bytecode exist in memory at the same time and so more memory is used then.
But that is a transient state.  The AST
is quickly discarded and its memory recycled, even before the call to
<a href="https://sqlite.org/draft/c3ref/prepare.html">sqlite3_prepare()</a> returns, so that the resulting <a href="https://sqlite.org/draft/c3ref/stmt.html">prepared statement</a> ends
up consuming less memory in its bytecode representation than it did as an AST.
This is important because calls to <a href="https://sqlite.org/draft/c3ref/prepare.html">sqlite3_prepare()</a> are transient, but
prepared statements are often cached for possible reuse and persist in memory
for a long time.

</p><h2 id="bytecode_is_faster"><span>2.5. </span>Bytecode Is Faster</h2>

<p>
I <i>believe</i> that a bytecode representation of a prepared statement
runs faster, because fewer decisions need to be made for each step of
the computation.  Emphasis on "believe" in the previous sentence
‚Üí it is difficult to verify
this claim experimentally since nobody has ever put in the multiple years
of effort necessary to generate equivalent bytecode and tree-of-object
representations of a prepared statement to see which one really does run faster.
We do know that <a href="https://sqlite.org/draft/fasterthanfs.html">SQLite is very fast</a>, but we
do not have good side-by-side comparisons with other SQL databases since
the other databases spend a lot of time doing client/server message processing,
and it is difficult to untangle the message round-trip overhead from the
actual processing time.

</p><h2 id="advantages_of_compiling_into_a_tree_of_objects"><span>3. </span>Advantages Of Compiling Into A Tree Of Objects</h2>

<p>Even though the SQLite developers think that the bytecode approach is
best, at least for the use cases the SQLite tries to fill, the
tree-of-objects approach to processing SQL does have some advantages over 
bytecode. There are always tradeoffs.

</p><h2 id="query_planning_decisions_can_be_deferred_until_runtime"><span>3.1. </span>Query Planning Decisions Can Be Deferred Until Runtime</h2>

<p>
When a prepared statement is bytecode, once the bytecode has been generated,
the algorithm is fixed - it is "baked in" - and becomes difficult to modify
as new information about the shape of the information being retrieved
becomes available.  This is not the case with a tree-of-objects prepared
statement.  A tree-of-objects is easier to modify on-the-fly.  The query
plan is mutable and can be tweaked as it is running, based on the progress
of the query.  Thus a query can be dynamically self-tuning.

</p><h2 id="dataflow_programs_are_easy_to_parallelize"><span>3.2. </span>Dataflow Programs Are Easy To Parallelize</h2>

<p>In a dataflow program, each processing node can be assigned to a
different thread.  There needs to be some kind of threadsafe queuing
mechanism for transferring intermediate results from one node to the
next.  But no synchronization primitives are typically needed within
each node of the program.  Node schedule is trivial:  A node becomes
eligible to run when it has data available and there is space in its
output queue.

</p><p>This is an important consideration for database engines that are
designed to run large analytic queries 
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_analytical_processing">OLAP</a>)
on large multi-core servers.
The primary focus of SQLite is transaction processing 
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_transaction_processing">OLTP</a>) 
on the internet-of-things, so there is less need to
represent prepared statements as dataflow programs in SQLite.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__blog-post-container"><p>Over last few years, we've been hard at work on <a href="https://typespec.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://typespec.io/</a>, a modern API definition language. This language is designed to meet the evolving needs of API developers, architects, and managers in an environment where the delivery of consistently high-quality APIs and related experiences is becoming increasingly complex and critical.</p>
<p>TypeSpec is more than just a new language; it's a platform that enables abstraction, encourages code reuse, and leverages modern tooling for rapid development. Meeting these needs requires a blend of innovative technology and fresh processes that place the API as the fundamental truth on which we build our sophisticated abstractions.</p>
<p>TypeSpec describes APIs using any protocol or serialization format with concise, familiar syntax and great editor tooling for Visual Studio and VS Code. It can encapsulate common data types, API patterns, and API guidelines into high level, reusable components that can be shared across teams or ecosystems. It can compile to standards compliant OpenAPI, JSON Schema, or Protobuf (or even all three at the same time).</p>
<p>We believe this new technology unlocks new ways for developers to build APIs and the applications around them in a more productive and higher quality way than in the past.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="hero" src="https://typespec.io/assets/images/hero-aa395aabbeb145076703d7bed45c8699.png" width="1205" height="643"></p>
<h2 id="key-features">Key Features<a href="#key-features" aria-label="Direct link to Key Features" title="Direct link to Key Features">‚Äã</a></h2>
<h3 id="interoperability">Interoperability<a href="#interoperability" aria-label="Direct link to Interoperability" title="Direct link to Interoperability">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>TypeSpec is not just another API description language; it's a higher-level definition language capable of defining your API and then outputting many different protocols, clients, servers, documentation and more, even simultaneously. This makes it a versatile tool that can adapt to a variety of development scenarios.
Furthermore, TypeSpec is committed to being interoperable with industry standard API definition languages, bridging the gap between different choices.</p>
<h3 id="productivity">Productivity<a href="#productivity" aria-label="Direct link to Productivity" title="Direct link to Productivity">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>TypeSpec provides a superior developer experience, making the process of defining data and APIs both enjoyable and productive. The language is concise and able to define complex data and API shapes with minimal typing.
Its tooling makes development and maintenance a breeze, surfacing errors and guideline violations at development time, long before any human review process gets involved.</p>
<h3 id="api-patterns">API Patterns<a href="#api-patterns" aria-label="Direct link to API Patterns" title="Direct link to API Patterns">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>TypeSpec improves API quality by encapsulating common data types, API patterns, and API guidelines into high-level, reusable components that can be shared across teams or ecosystems.
This alignment of components with domain and business-specific concepts ensures that specs are written in a language everyone understands, rather than low-level protocol details.</p>
<h3 id="familiarity">Familiarity<a href="#familiarity" aria-label="Direct link to Familiarity" title="Direct link to Familiarity">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>Inspired by TypeScript and C#, TypeSpec is easy to learn and feels familiar to many developers, reducing the learning curve.</p>
<h3 id="extensibility">Extensibility<a href="#extensibility" aria-label="Direct link to Extensibility" title="Direct link to Extensibility">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>TypeSpec can be extended with custom decorator vocabularies and type templates, allowing you to model APIs in your business or application logic domain.
Its extensibility allows it to describe many different protocols, serialization formats, or domain-specific metadata, serving as a source-of-truth for anything API-related.</p>
<h3 id="ecosystem">Ecosystem<a href="#ecosystem" aria-label="Direct link to Ecosystem" title="Direct link to Ecosystem">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>TypeSpec allows packaging of common types, language extensions, linters, and emitters into packages, which can be distributed on NPM within your organization or across the ecosystem.</p>

<p>At Microsoft, we believe in the value of using our own products, a practice often referred to as "dogfooding". This approach allows us to test and understand our products firsthand.
Many Azure services within Microsoft have already adopted TypeSpec, and the number is growing daily. This internal use of TypeSpec not only demonstrates its effectiveness but also provides us with valuable feedback for continuous improvement. By using TypeSpec in our own development processes, we ensure its reliability and efficiency for API development.
Harnessing the power of TypeSpec, the Microsoft Graph team has revolutionized API development within Microsoft. This collaboration has enhanced productivity and simplified customization, underscoring TypeSpec's potential.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In the Microsoft Graph team, we've been excited to partner with our colleagues building TypeSpec to create a productive and innovative environment for the engineers creating all the varied and rich APIs accessible through Microsoft Graph.
TypeSpec has provided us with an amazing platform to build terse and expressive API descriptions, and customizing the language to match Microsoft Graph's domain has been easy and fun."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="join-us">Join Us<a href="#join-us" aria-label="Direct link to Join Us" title="Direct link to Join Us">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>TypeSpec is more than just a language; it's a community. We believe in the power of collaboration, and that's why TypeSpec is open source. We invite developers from all backgrounds to join the public beta and experience the power of TypeSpec firsthand. Your feedback is invaluable in shaping the future of TypeSpec, and we encourage you to share your thoughts, suggestions, and bug reports on our community forums.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>TypeSpec is a powerful tool that can revolutionize the way you approach API development. By facilitating an "API First" approach, it allows you to define your APIs upfront, leading to more efficient development and higher quality end products. Its support for a variety of protocols, combined with its extensibility and robust ecosystem, make it a versatile tool that can adapt to a wide range of development scenarios.
We encourage you to try out TypeSpec and experience its benefits firsthand. Whether you're developing an OpenAPI specification, a JSON RPC interface, or simply looking to improve data validation and type consistency, TypeSpec has the capabilities to meet your needs.

<p>For years, FireChat helped people circumvent their internet gatekeepers‚Äî the authoritarian governments and spineless corporations that control our every move through a network of proprietary data centers and deep-sea cables.</p>
<p>In Iran, forty thousand people downloaded the app when their government blocked internet access. Over one hundred thousand protesters in Hong Kong used the app to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/29/firechat-messaging-app-powering-hong-kong-protests">coordinate their resistance</a> against Chinese authority. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbrella_Movement">Singaporeans</a>, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/firechat-comes-to-uoh-students-rescue/articleshow/50691376.cms">Indians</a>, <a href="https://globalvoices.org/2015/06/28/the-internet-a-staging-post-for-protests-in-ecuador-is-under-threat/">Ecuadorians</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-12-30/russians-are-organizing-against-putin-using-firechat-messaging-app">Russians</a>, and seemingly every pro-democracy movement globally took advantage of the off-grid messaging app.</p>
<p>What made FireChat an effective tool for revolution was its ability to bypass the centralized and often monopolized Internet Service Providers. Launched in 2011 by Open Garden, FireChat allowed people to communicate without an Internet connection. The mobile app cleverly leveraged Bluetooth and WiFi signals already emitting from our phones to create peer-to-peer connections known as a mesh network.</p>
<p>In 2014, after Hong Kong protesters demonstrated to the world how effective a tool it was, news blogs quickly pointed out that FireChat messages were not secure. By 2015, Open Garden updated the app to include end-to-end encryption, a feature that many modern messaging apps still lack today.</p>
<p>In 2015, Wired <a href="https://archive.ph/sUPif">called FireChat</a> a "Giant Network of Free Messaging.‚Äù Indeed, but it was so much more. The mesh network enabled by FireChat was a new internet by the people, literally. The larger the crowd, the better the technology worked, as messages would "bounce‚Äù from phone to phone until they reached their recipient.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/24/firechat-updates-as-40000-iraqis-download-mesh-chat-app-to-get-online-in-censored-baghdad">Firechat updates as 40,000 Iraqis download 'mesh' chat app in censored Baghdad</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Your phone today, your smartphone, not only has a radio to connect to a cell tower, but it also has other radios, like WiFi or Bluetooth, to connect to other devices around," explains OpenGarden co-founder Micha Benoliel. "And when smartphones are next to each other with Firechat, they directly interconnect."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The technology worked so well that Open Garden then released <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/19/11711686/firechat-alerts-app-natural-disaster-mesh-network">FireChat Alerts</a>, allowing rescue workers to send offline messages during emergencies.</p>
<p>Mind you, all of this was happening off-grid, without mega corporations mining our data or governments spying through corporate-sanctioned back doors.</p>
<p>Then, one day in February 2020, as COVID-19 swept the globe, access to FireChat was completely cut off without explanation. Four months later, a police officer murdered a Black man in Minnesota, resulting in protests across the United States.</p>
<p>Those protests sparked a roaring fire of consciousness over Ôøºthis country's injustices. But no one on the ground fighting for our rights has been able to use the people's internet that never was.</p>
<p>Today, if you go to the official FireChat website, you're greeted hostilely with a message that your IP address has been blocked for suspicious activity. The Internet Archive view of the site shows the same message, so don't feel too bad. The Open Garden website shows a similar, though admittedly less hostile-feeling 403 Forbidden error.</p>
<p>No acquisition announcement for FireChat can be found. No teary-eyed "it's been an incredible journey‚Äù open letter by its founders was ever published. FireChat, and then later its parent company Open Garden, closed for business without any acknowledgment.</p>
<p>Without any information, it's hard to say why FireChat disappeared. If pressed about it, someone somewhere has a carefully constructed story with a plausible explanation, I'm sure. However, by all accounts, FireChat's mesh network technology was greater than the sum of its users. It was freedom from a ruthlessly for-profit internet that has increasingly become more centralized and monopolistic. And the fact that no one seems to have anything to say about this once darling of Silicon Valley tells us all we need to know.</p>
<p>FireChat is gone because FireChat was a threat to the systems it circumvented.</p>
