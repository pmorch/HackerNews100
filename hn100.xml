<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


<p>
On each of the last two Fridays, Google has suspended <a href="https://sslmate.com/" rel="external">SSLMate</a>'s Google Cloud access without notification, having previously suspended
it in 2024 without notification. But this isn't just another cautionary tale about using Google Cloud
Platform; it's also a story about usable security and how Google's capriciousness is forcing me to choose
between weakening security or reducing usability.
</p>

<p>
Apart from testing and experimentation, the only reason SSLMate still has a Google Cloud presence
is to enable integrations with our customers' Google Cloud accounts so that we can
publish certificate validation DNS records and discover domain names to monitor
on their behalf.  We create a service account for each customer under our Google Cloud project,
and ask the customer to authorize this service account to access Cloud DNS and Cloud Domains.
When SSLMate needs to access a customer's Google Cloud account, it impersonates the corresponding
service account.  I developed this system based on a suggestion in <a href="https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/13463817?sjid=3625613075585023337-NA#zippy=%2Chow-can-i-access-data-from-my-users-google-cloud-project-using-cloud-apis" rel="external">Google's own documentation</a> (under "How can I access data from my users' Google Cloud project using Cloud APIs?") and it works really well.
It is both very easy for the customer to configure, and secure: there are no long-lived credentials or confused
deputy vulnerabilities.
</p>

<p>
Easy <em>and</em> secure: I love it when that's possible!
</p>

<p>
The only problem is that Google keeps suspending our Google Cloud access.
</p>


<h4>The First Suspension</h4>

<p>
Google suspended us for the first time in 2024.  Our customer integrations began failing, and
logging into the Google Cloud console returned this error:
</p>

<p><a href="https://www.agwa.name/blog/post/google_suspended_sslmates_cloud_account_again/media/1.png"><img src="https://www.agwa.name/blog/post/google_suspended_sslmates_cloud_account_again/media/1.png" alt="Screenshot of Google Cloud web page stating &quot;Your account has been disabled&quot;"></a></p>

<p>
Although Google's customer support people were surprisingly responsive considering Google's
rock-bottom reputation in this area, the process to recover our account was super frustrating:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Google required me to email them from the address associated with the account, but when
I did so, the message was bounced with the error "The account [redacted] is disabled" (the
redacted portion being the email address I sent from).  When I emailed from a different address, the message went
through, but the support people initially refused to communicate with it because it was the wrong address.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
At one point Google asked me to provide the IDs of our Google Cloud projects - information which I could not retrieve
because I couldn't log in to the console.  Have <em>you</em> saved your project IDs in a safe place in case your account gets suspended?
</p>
</li>



<li>
<p>
After several emails back and forth with Google support, and verifying a phone number, I was able to log back into the
Google Cloud console, but two of our projects were still suspended, including the one needed for the customer integrations.
(At the time, we still had some domains registered through Google Cloud Domains, and thankfully the project
for this was accessible, allowing me to begin transferring all of our domains out to a more dependable registrar.)
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
The day after I regained access to the console, I received an
automated email from no-reply@accounts.google.com stating that my
access to Google Cloud Platform had been restricted.  Once again, I could no
longer access the console, but the error message was different this time:
</p>

<p><a href="https://www.agwa.name/blog/post/google_suspended_sslmates_cloud_account_again/media/2.png"><img src="https://www.agwa.name/blog/post/google_suspended_sslmates_cloud_account_again/media/2.png" alt="Screenshot of Google Cloud web page stating &quot;Access to a service or feature has been restricted&quot; and listing Google Cloud Platform as &quot;Entire service unavailable&quot;"></a></p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Twelve hours later, I received multiple automated
emails from google-cloud-compliance@google.com stating that my Google
Cloud projects had been "reinstated" but I still could not access the
console.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Seven hours after that, I got another automated email from
no-reply@accounts.google.com stating that my access to Google Cloud
Platform had been restored.  Everything began working after this.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
I was never told why our account was suspended or what could be done to
prevent it from happening again.
Although <a href="https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/project-suspension-guidelines" rel="external">Google claims
to send emails when an account or project is suspended</a>, they never did so for the initial suspension.
Since errors with customer integrations were only being displayed in our customers' SSLMate consoles (usually
an error indicates the customer made a mistake), I didn't learn about the suspension right away.  I fixed this by
adding a health check that fails if a large percentage of Google Cloud integrations have errors.
</p>

<h4>The Second Suspension</h4>

<p>
Two Fridays ago, that health check failed.  I immediately investigated and saw
that all but one Google Cloud integrations were failing with the same error as during
last year's suspension ("Invalid grant: account not found").  Groaning, I tried logging into the Google Cloud console,
bracing myself for another Kafkaesque reinstatement process.  <em>At least I know
the project IDs this time</em>, I reassured myself.  Surprisingly, I was able to log in
successfully.  Then I got emails, one per Google Cloud project, informing me
that my projects had been reinstated "based on information that [I] have provided."
Naturally, I had received no emails that they had been suspended in the first place.
The integrations started working again.
</p>



<h4>The Third Suspension</h4>

<p>
Last Friday, the health check failed again.  I logged in to the Google Cloud console,
unsure what to expect.  This time, I was presented with a <em>third</em>
type of error message:
</p>

<p><a href="https://www.agwa.name/blog/post/google_suspended_sslmates_cloud_account_again/media/3.png"><img src="https://www.agwa.name/blog/post/google_suspended_sslmates_cloud_account_again/media/3.png" alt="Screenshot of Google Cloud web page stating &quot;We have detected a Terms of Service violation in SSLMate Integrations&quot; and containing a form to submit an appeal"></a></p>

<p>
Most, but not all, of SSLMate's Google Cloud projects were suspended, including the one needed
for customer integrations.
</p>

<p>
I submitted an appeal on Friday. 
On Sunday, I received an email from Google. Was it a response to the appeal? Nope!
It was an automated email stating that SSLMate's access to Google Cloud was now <em>completely</em> suspended.
</p>

<h4>The Lucky Customer</h4>

<p>
Incredibly, we have one lucky customer whose integration has continued to work
during every suspension, even though it uses a service account in the same suspended project
as all the other customer integrations.
</p>

<h4>What Now?</h4>

<p>
Clearly, I cannot rely on having a Google account for production use cases.
Google has built a complex, unreliable system in which
some or all of the following can be suspended: an entire Google account, a Google
Cloud Platform account, or individual Google Cloud projects.
</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the alternatives for integrations are not great.</p>



<p>
The first alternative is to ask customers to create a service account for SSLMate and have SSLMate
authenticate to it using a long-lived key.  This is pretty easy, but less secure since the
long-lived key could leak and can never be rotated in practice.
</p>

<p>
The second alternative is to use OpenID Connect, aka OIDC.  In recent years, OIDC has become the de facto standard
for integrations between service providers.  For example, you can use OIDC to let <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/secure-your-work/security-harden-deployments/oidc-in-google-cloud-platform" rel="external">GitHub Actions
access your Google Cloud account</a> without the need for long-lived credentials.  SSLMate's Azure integration
uses OIDC and it works well.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, Google has made setting up OIDC unnecessarily difficult.  What is currently
a simple one step process for our customers to add an integration (assign some roles to a service account) would
become a complicated seven step process:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Enable the IAM Service Account Credentials API.</li>
<li>Create a service account.</li>
<li>Create a workload identity pool.</li>
<li>Create a workload identity provider in the pool created in step 3.</li>
<li>Allow SSLMate to impersonate the service account created in step 2 (this requires knowing the ID of the pool created in step 3).</li>
<li>Assign roles to the service account created in step 2.</li>
<li>Provide SSLMate with the ID of the service account created in step 2, and the ID of the workload identity provider created in step 4.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Since many of the steps require knowing the identifiers of resources created in previous steps, it's hard for SSLMate to provide easy-to-follow instructions.
</p>

<p>
This is more complicated than it needs to be:
</p>

<ul><li><p>Creating a service account (steps 1, 2, and 5) should not be necessary.  While it is possible to forgo a service account and assign roles directly to an identity from the pool, not all Google Cloud services support this. If you want your integration to work with all current and future services, you have to impersonate a service account.  Google should stop treating OIDC like a second-class citizen and guarantee that all current and future services will directly support it.</p></li><li><p>Creating an identity pool shouldn't be necessary either.  While I'm sure some use
cases are nicely served by pools, it seems like most setups
are going to have just one provider per pool, making the extra step
of creating a pool nothing but unnecessary busy work.</p></li><li><p>Even creating a provider shouldn't be necessary; it should be possible to assign roles
directly to an OIDC issuer URL and subject. You should only have to create
a provider if you need to do more advanced configuration, such as mapping
attributes.</p></li></ul>

<p>
I find this state of affairs unacceptable, because it's really, really important to move away
from long-lived credentials and Google ought to be doing everything possible
to encourage more secure alternatives.  Sadly, SSLMate's current solution of
provider-created service accounts is susceptible to
arbitrary account suspensions, and OIDC is hampered by an unnecessarily complicated setup process.
</p>

<p>
In summary, when setting up cross-provider access with Google Cloud, you can have only two of the following:
</p>

<ol>
<li>No dangerous long-lived credentials.</li>
<li>Easy for the customer to set up.</li>
<li>Safe from arbitrary account suspensions.</li>
</ol>


<table>
	<thead>
		
		<tr>
			<th>Provider-created service accounts</th>
			<th>Service account + key</th>
			<th>OpenID Connect</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>No long-lived keys</td>
			<td></td>
			<td>No long-lived keys</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Easy setup</td>
			<td>Easy setup</td>
			<td></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td></td>
			<td>Safe from suspension</td>
			<td>Safe from suspension</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>Which two would you pick?</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
      <p><a href="https://nextcloud.com/">Nextcloud.</a> I really want to like it, but it’s making it really difficult.</p>
<p>I like what Nextcloud offers with its feature set and how easily it replaces a bunch of services under one roof (files,
calendar, contacts, notes, to-do lists, photos etc.), but no matter how hard I try and how much I optimize its resources
on my home server, it feels slow to use, even on hardware that is ranging from decent to good. Then I opened developer
tools and found the culprit.</p>
<p><em><strong>It’s the Javascript.</strong></em></p>
<p>On a clean page load, you will be downloading about <strong>15-20 MB</strong> of Javascript, which does compress down to about 4-5
MB in transit, but that is still <strong>a huge amount of Javascript.</strong> For context, I consider 1 MB of Javascript to be on the
heavy side for a web page/app.</p>
<p>Yes, that Javascript will be cached in the browser for a while, but you will still be executing all of that on each
visit to your Nextcloud instance, and that will take a long time due to the sheer amount of code your browser now has to
execute on the page.</p>
<p>A significant contributor to this heft seems to be the <code>core-common.js</code> bundle, which based on its name seems to provide
some common functionality that’s shared across different Nextcloud apps that one can install. It’s coming in at <strong>4.71
MB</strong> at the time of writing.</p>
<p>Then you want notifications, right? <code>NotificationsApp.chunk.mjs</code> is here to cover you, at <strong>1.06 MB</strong>.</p>
<p>Then there are the app-specific views. The Calendar app is taking up <strong>5.94 MB</strong> to show a basic calendar view.</p>

<p>This means that even on an iPhone 13 mini, opening the Tasks app (to-do list), will take a ridiculously long time.
Imagine opening your shopping list at the store and having to wait 5-10 seconds before you see anything, even with a
solid 5G connection. Sounds extremely annoying, right?</p>
<p>I suspect that a lot of this is due to how Nextcloud is architected. There’s bound to be some hefty common libraries and
tools that allow app developers to provide a unified experience, but even then there is something seriously wrong with
the end result, the functionality to bundle size ratio is way off.</p>
<p>As a result, I’ve started branching out some things from Nextcloud, such as replacing the Tasks app with using a
private <a href="https://vikunja.io/">Vikunja</a> instance, and Photos to a private <a href="https://immich.app/">Immich</a> instance. Vikunja
is not perfect, but its 1.5 MB of Javascript is an order of magnitude smaller compared to Nextcloud, making it feel
incredibly fast in comparison.</p>
<p>However, with other functionality I have to admit that the convenience of Nextcloud is enough to dissuade me from
replacing it elsewhere, due to the available feature set comparing well to alternatives.</p>
<p><em><strong>For now.</strong></em></p>
<p>I’m sure that there are some legitimate reasons behind the current state, and overworked development teams and
volunteers are unfortunately the norm in the industry, but it doesn’t take away the fact that the user experience and
accessibility suffers as a result.</p>
<p>I’d like to thank <a href="https://infrequently.org/about-me/">Alex Russell</a> for writing about web performance and why it
matters, with supporting evidence and actionable advice, it has changed how I view websites and web apps and has pushed
me to be better in my own work. I highly suggest reading his content, starting
with <a href="https://infrequently.org/series/performance-inequality/">the performance inequality gap series.</a> It’s educational,
insightful and incredibly irritating once you learn how crap most things are and how careless a lot of development teams
are towards performance and accessibility.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>








<p>UK-based YASA has just built a tiny electric motor that makes Tesla motors look like slackers, and this invention could potentially reshape the future of EVs.</p>



<p>The company has unveiled a new prototype that’s breaking records for power and performance density.</p>



<p>It’s smaller and lighter than traditional motors, yet it’s somehow more powerful.</p>



<p>Perhaps the best part is that it’s a fully functional motor, rather than some lab-only concept.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://sbxcars.com/?utm_source=supercarblondie.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=article-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SBX CARS</a>&nbsp;– View live supercar auctions powered by Supercar Blondie</strong></p>



<h2>This tiny electric motor can produce more than 1,000 horsepower</h2>



<p>The new YASA axial flux motor weighs just 28 pounds, or about the same as a small dog. </p>



<figure>
<figure><a href="https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/YASA-tiny-electric-motor.webp" data-lightbox="159709" data-title="YASA"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="100%" height="200" data-id="159720" src="https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/YASA-tiny-electric-motor-1024x640.webp" alt="Tiny electric motor is as powerful as four Tesla motors put together and outperforms record holder by 40%" srcset="https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/YASA-tiny-electric-motor-1024x640.webp 1024w, https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/YASA-tiny-electric-motor-500x313.webp 500w, https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/YASA-tiny-electric-motor-768x480.webp 768w, https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/YASA-tiny-electric-motor.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>YASA</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>However, it delivers a jaw-dropping 750 kilowatts of power, <a href="https://supercarblondie.com/hennessey-unveils-cadillac-le-monstre-1950s-cadillac-tribute-to-le-mans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">which is the equivalent of 1,005 horsepower</a>. </p>



<p>That’s about the same as two <a href="https://supercarblondie.com/bmw-m8-drag-race-tesla-model-3-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">Tesla Model 3 Performance cars</a> combined, or four individual Tesla motors.</p>



<p>In comparison, the previous record holder, which was also produced by the same company, weighed 28.8 pounds, and achieved a peak power of 550 kilowatts (737 horsepower).</p>



<p>This makes the current electric motor 40 percent better than the previous edition.</p>



<p>It can also sustain between 350 and 400 kilowatts (469–536 horsepower) continuously, meaning it’s not just built for short bursts, as it can deliver massive power all day long.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://yasa.com/news/yasa-smashes-own-unofficial-power-density-world-record-pushing-state-of-the-art-electric-motor-to-staggering-new-59kw-kg-benchmark/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="">YASA</a>, this is achieved without using exotic or expensive materials, so the design could actually be scalable once the demand kicks in.</p>



<p>“This record demonstrates what makes YASA unique,” said CEO Joerg Miska. </p>



<p>“With three times the performance density of today’s leading radial flux motors, we’re redefining what’s possible in electric motor design.”</p>



<p>In simpler terms, the company has made a motor that is small, light, and ridiculously powerful.</p>

<h2>YASA already produces motors for many expensive cars</h2>



<p>That’s a big deal for <a href="https://supercarblondie.com/cars/ev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">EVs</a>. </p>



<p>A lighter motor means a lighter car, which means better efficiency, faster acceleration, and longer range from the same battery.</p>



<p>For EVs, every pound matters, so saving weight without compromising performance could be a gamechanger.</p>



<p>YASA, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of <a href="https://supercarblondie.com/cars/manufacturers/mercedes-benz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">Mercedes-Benz</a>, already produces motors that power some of the world’s fastest and most expensive cars. </p>



<p>These include <a href="https://supercarblondie.com/first-ever-look-at-mercedes-amg-gtxx-concept/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">the Mercedes-AMG GT XX concept</a>, and <a href="https://supercarblondie.com/ferrari-296-gtb-representing-gulf-nation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">the Ferrari 296 GTB</a>.</p>

<p>Perhaps as production scales and prices drop, these ultra-efficient motors could find their way into <a href="https://supercarblondie.com/new-303-mile-nissan-leaf-ev-becomes-the-cheapest-ev-in-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">everyday EVs</a>, like the Nissan Leaf EV, which is the cheapest EV in the US.</p>



<p>For now, the company’s tiny electric motor proves that big things can come in small packages, and that performance need not be sacrificed.</p>

her academic freedom was traded for access to the Chinese student market</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component="text-block"><p>China waged a campaign of harassment and intimidation directed at a UK university to get it to shut down sensitive research into alleged human rights abuses, documents seen by the BBC show.</p><p>Sheffield Hallam University staff in China were threatened by individuals described by them as being from China's National Security Service who demanded the research being  done in Sheffield be halted.</p><p>And access to the university's websites from China was blocked, impeding its ability to recruit Chinese students, in a campaign of threats and intimidation lasting more than two years.</p><p>In an internal email from July 2024, university officials said "attempting to retain the business in China and publication of the research are now untenable bedfellows".</p><p>When the UK government learned of the case, the then Foreign Secretary David Lammy issued a warning to his Chinese counterpart that it would not tolerate attempts to suppress academic freedoms at UK universities, the BBC understands.</p><p>The issue was also raised with China's most senior education minister.</p><p>China was seeking to halt research by Laura Murphy, professor of human rights and contemporary slavery at Sheffield Hallam, into allegations Uyghur Muslims in the north-western region of Xinjiang were subject to forced labour.</p><p>China <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-22278037">has faced accusations</a> – always firmly denied – that it has committed crimes against humanity and possibly genocide against the Uyghur population.</p><p>In late 2024, following pressure from the Chinese state and a separate defamation law suit against the university, Sheffield Hallam decided not to publish a final piece of research by Prof Murphy and her team into forced labour.</p><p>And in early 2025, university administrators told her that she could "not continue with her research into supply chains and forced labour in China".</p><p>She initiated legal action against the university for failing in its duty to protect her academic freedom and she submitted a "subject access request" demanding Sheffield Hallam hand over any relevant internal documents.</p><p>The documents she obtained showed the university "had negotiated directly with a foreign intelligence service to trade my academic freedom for access to the Chinese student market," she told the BBC.</p><p>She added: "I'd never seen anything quite so patently explicit about the extent to which a university would go to ensure that they have Chinese student income."</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img

Well done Laura!"</p><p>Over the following months her unit published four reports, including into car parts and cotton for clothing, trying to trace supply chains and highlight where goods reaching western consumers may have been produced with inputs made with forced labour in Xinjiang.</p><p>China denies such practices occur.</p><p>The Chinese Embassy in London told the BBC "the Helena Kennedy Centre at the Sheffield Hallam University has released multiple fake reports on Xinjiang that are seriously flawed".</p><p>"It has been revealed that some authors of these reports received funding from certain US agencies," the Embassy added.</p><p>Prof Murphy told the BBC she has received funding over the course of her career from the US National Endowment for Humanities for work on slave narratives, the US Department of Justice for work on human trafficking in New Orleans, and more recently from USAID, the US State Department and the UK Foreign Office for her work on China.</p><p>The Chinese Embassy said the allegations of "forced labor" in her reports "cannot withstand basic fact-check".</p><p>"While presenting itself as an academic body, the Centre has in practice acted as a vehicle for politicised and disinformation-driven narratives deployed by anti-China forces," the embassy added.</p><p>The university realised it was coming in for criticism from China as far back as 2022.</p><p>An internal university email from August of that year, seen by the BBC, said China's foreign ministry had issued a statement "denouncing us as being in the 'disreputable vanguard of anti-China rhetoric'".</p><p>The email said the university had admitted 500 Chinese students in 2018, but numbers had collapsed in the pandemic and had not bounced back like it had in other markets. </p><p>It expressed concern that the Chinese government's criticisms could result in a "boycott" by prospective students and recruitment agents. </p><p>In total, the documents show Sheffield had earned £3.8m in 2021/22 from China and Hong Kong.</p><p>Later in August 2022 the university's English language testing website used by Chinese students to take tests before coming to Sheffield had been "shut down in China temporarily".</p><p>Over the next two years the pressure escalated dramatically leading university officials to write in an email in May 2024 that "the continuation of the university's scholarly activity with and in China and Hong Kong has been placed at risk because of the research activities, led by Professor Laura Murphy, in relation to alleged persecution of Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang, China".</p><p>An internal "risk summary," dated 9 December 2024, detailed what had happened.</p><p>In August 2022, China had blocked access to the university's websites. All email communication from and to the university was disabled.</p><p>It meant students in China due to study at Sheffield Hallam were unable to access the enrolment website, arrange their welcome or airport pick up in the UK, or course information.</p><p>The university said this had "undoubtedly had a negative impact on recruitment" in 23/24, with "anticipated further decline in 24/25".</p><p>And, in 2024, the intimidation began.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>"Things in Beijing have kicked off," an internal email from 18 April 2024 said.</p><p>The risk summary detailed that "three officers of the National Security Service" visited Sheffield Hallam's office in China.</p><p>A local staff member was "questioned for two hours regarding the HKC research and future publications. </p><p>"The tone was threatening and message to cease the research activity was made clear."</p><p>At another visit, security officers said the internet issues were because the Uyghur research was available on the university website.</p><p>Finally, in September 2024, the document states "a decision by the university not to publish a final phase of the research on forced labour in China was communicated to the National Security Service .. immediately relations improved and the threat to staff wellbeing appears to be removed".</p><p>Sheffield Hallam says these internal communications need to be seen in context and do not represent university policy.</p><p>Complicating things for Sheffield Hallam had been a report by its Forced Labour Lab published December 2023 into clothing supply chains connected to Xinjiang.</p><p>Smart Shirts Ltd, a Hong Kong supplier of garments with customers in the UK, brought a claim for libel, alleging it had been defamed as its name was included.</p><p>A preliminary ruling at the High Court in London in December 2024 found that report had been "defamatory".</p><p>A full trial in that case is yet to take place at which Sheffield Hallam will be able to put forward its defence to the company's claim, but the university was told by its insurers that "any defamation, libel or slander" claims linked to its entire Social and Economic Research Institute were no longer covered.</p><p>Professor Murphy had, meanwhile, built an international profile.</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251021-134202-667692b2c6-web-2.32.2-1/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/a4f2/live/ed9f3490-b678-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/a4f2/live/ed9f3490-b678-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a4f2/live/ed9f3490-b678-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/a4f2/live/ed9f3490-b678-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/a4f2/live/ed9f3490-b678-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/a4f2/live/ed9f3490-b678-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/a4f2/live/ed9f3490-b678-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a4f2/live/ed9f3490-b678-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="UK Parliament Baroness Helena Kennedy KC in a purple jacket with a fur collar against a neutral grey backdrop"><span>UK Parliament</span></p></div><p data-component="caption-block"><figcaption>Baroness Kennedy says UK universities are vulnerable to pressure from China</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component="text-block"><p>Her work had been cited in the UK parliament, in Canada and in Australia.

    <p>Thought you would be interested to know that Marius Gerbershagen has used
ecl to compile Maxima to wasm to run in a browser.  I believe it's a pretty
complete implementation with fancy TeX display of formulas and nice
graphics via gnuplot compiled to wasm.

See it at <a target="_blank" href="http://maxima-on-wasm.pages.dev/">http://maxima-on-wasm.pages.dev/</a>

Oxy is a foundation of several Cloudflare projects, including the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/gateway/">Zero Trust Gateway</a>, the iCloud Private Relay <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/icloud-private-relay/">second hop proxy</a>, and the internal <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-servers-dont-own-ips-anymore/">egress routing service</a>.</p><p>Oxy leverages our years of experience building high-load proxies to implement the latest communication protocols, enabling us to effortlessly build sophisticated services that can accommodate massive amounts of daily traffic.</p><p>We will be exploring Oxy in greater detail in upcoming technical blog posts, providing a comprehensive and in-depth look at its capabilities and potential applications. For now, let us embark on this journey and discover what Oxy is and how we built it.</p>
    <p>
      <h2 id="what-oxy-does">What Oxy does</h2>
      
    </p>
    <p>We refer to Oxy as our "next-generation proxy framework". But what do we really mean by “proxy framework”? Picture a server (like NGINX, that reader might be familiar with) that can proxy traffic with an array of protocols, including various predefined common traffic flow scenarios that enable you to route traffic to specific destinations or even egress with a different protocol than the one used for ingress. This server can be configured in many ways for specific flows and boasts tight integration with the surrounding infrastructure, whether telemetry consumers or networking services.</p><p>Now, take all of that and add in the ability to programmatically control every aspect of the proxying: protocol decapsulation, traffic analysis, routing, tunneling logic, DNS resolution, and so much more. And this is what Oxy proxy framework is: a feature-rich proxy server tightly integrated with our internal infrastructure that's customizable to meet application requirements, allowing engineers to tweak every component.</p><p>This design is in line with our belief in an iterative approach to development, where a basic solution is built first and then gradually improved over time. With Oxy, you can start with a basic solution that can be deployed to our servers and then add additional features as needed, taking advantage of the many extensibility points offered by Oxy. In fact, you can avoid writing any code, besides a few lines of bootstrap boilerplate and get a production-ready server with a wide variety of startup configuration options and traffic flow scenarios.</p>
            <figure>
            
            <img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5nk7Ri6viC85BdWoRSiB9v/f40a9971fdad71cb07ee0b3aebf99fd9/image3-2.png" alt="High-level Oxy architecture" width="1999" height="1478" loading="lazy">
            
            </figure><p><i>High-level Oxy architecture</i></p><p>For example, suppose you'd like to implement an HTTP firewall. With Oxy, you can proxy HTTP(S) requests right out of the box, eliminating the need to write any code related to production services, such as request metrics and logs. You simply need to implement an Oxy hook handler for HTTP requests and responses. If you've used <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/examples/respond-with-another-site/">Cloudflare Workers</a> before, then you should be familiar with this extensibility model.</p><p>Similarly, you can implement a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model">layer 4</a> firewall by providing application hooks that handle ingress and egress connections. This goes beyond a simple block/accept scenario, as you can build authentication functionality or a traffic router that sends traffic to different destinations based on the geographical information of the ingress connection. The capabilities are incredibly rich, and we've made the extensibility model as ergonomic and flexible as possible. As an example, if information obtained from layer 4 is insufficient to make an informed firewall decision, the app can simply ask Oxy to decapsulate the traffic and process it with HTTP firewall.</p><p>The aforementioned scenarios are prevalent in many products we build at Cloudflare, so having a foundation that incorporates ready solutions is incredibly useful. This foundation has absorbed lots of experience we've gained over the years, taking care of many sharp and dark corners of high-load service programming. As a result, application implementers can stay focused on the business logic of their application with Oxy taking care of the rest. In fact, we've been able to create a few privacy proxy applications using Oxy that now serve massive amounts of traffic in production with less than a couple of hundred lines of code. This is something that would have taken multiple orders of magnitude more time and lines of code before.</p><p>As previously mentioned, we'll dive deeper into the technical aspects in future blog posts. However, for now, we'd like to provide a brief overview of Oxy's capabilities. This will give you a glimpse of the many ways in which Oxy can be customized and used.</p>
    <p>
      <h3 id="on-ramps">On-ramps</h3>
      
    </p>
    <p>On-ramp defines a combination of transport layer socket type and protocols that server listeners can use for ingress traffic.</p><p>Oxy supports a wide variety of traffic on-ramps:</p><ul><li><p>HTTP 1/2/3 (including various CONNECT protocols for layer 3 and 4 traffic)</p></li><li><p>TCP and UDP traffic over Proxy Protocol</p></li><li><p>general purpose IP traffic, including ICMP</p></li></ul><p>With Oxy, you have the ability to analyze and manipulate traffic at multiple layers of the OSI model - from layer 3 to layer 7. This allows for a wide range of possibilities in terms of how you handle incoming traffic.</p><p>One of the most notable and powerful features of Oxy is the ability for applications to force decapsulation. This means that an application can analyze traffic at a higher level, even if it originally arrived at a lower level. For example, if an application receives IP traffic, it can choose to analyze the UDP traffic encapsulated within the IP packets. With just a few lines of code, the application can tell Oxy to upgrade the IP flow to a UDP tunnel, effectively allowing the same code to be used for different on-ramps.</p><p>The application can even go further and ask Oxy to sniff UDP packets and check if they contain <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/what-is-http3/">HTTP/3 traffic</a>. In this case, Oxy can upgrade the UDP traffic to HTTP and handle HTTP/3 requests that were originally received as raw IP packets. This allows for the simultaneous processing of traffic at all three layers (L3, L4, L7), enabling applications to analyze, filter, and manipulate the traffic flow from multiple perspectives. This provides a robust toolset for developing advanced traffic processing applications.</p>

            <img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4tVlLbQeNVeN2lYN9ovJNH/d87cc5adb53ff0fc441530520540f781/image1-1.png" alt="Multi-layer traffic processing in Oxy applications" width="1999" height="817" loading="lazy">
            
            </figure><p><i>Multi-layer traffic processing in Oxy applications</i></p>
    <p>
      <h3 id="off-ramps">Off-ramps</h3>
      
    </p>
    <p>Off-ramp defines a combination of transport layer socket type and protocols that proxy server connectors can use for egress traffic.</p><p>Oxy offers versatility in its egress methods, supporting a range of protocols including HTTP 1 and 2, UDP, TCP, and IP. It is equipped with internal DNS resolution and caching, as well as customizable resolvers, with automatic fallback options for maximum system reliability. Oxy implements <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8305">happy eyeballs</a> for TCP, advanced tunnel timeout logic and has the ability to route traffic to internal services with accompanying metadata.</p><p>Additionally, through collaboration with one of our internal services (which is an Oxy application itself!) <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/geoexit-improving-warp-user-experience-larger-network/">Oxy is able to offer geographical egress</a> — allowing applications to route traffic to the public Internet from various locations in our extensive network covering numerous cities worldwide. This complex and powerful feature can be easily utilized by Oxy application developers at no extra cost, simply by adjusting configuration settings.</p>
    <p>
      <h3 id="tunneling-and-request-handling">Tunneling and request handling</h3>
      
    </p>
    <p>We've discussed Oxy's communication capabilities with the outside world through on-ramps and off-ramps. In the middle, Oxy handles efficient stateful tunneling of various traffic types including TCP, UDP, QUIC, and IP, while giving applications full control over traffic blocking and redirection.</p><p>Additionally, Oxy effectively handles HTTP traffic, providing full control over requests and responses, and allowing it to serve as a direct HTTP or API service. With built-in tools for streaming analysis of HTTP bodies, Oxy makes it easy to extract and process data, such as form data from uploads and downloads.</p><p>In addition to its multi-layer traffic processing capabilities, Oxy also supports advanced HTTP tunneling methods, such as <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9298">CONNECT-UDP</a> and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-masque-connect-ip/">CONNECT-IP</a>, using the latest extensions to HTTP 3 and 2 protocols. It can even process HTTP CONNECT request payloads on layer 4 and recursively process the payload as HTTP if the encapsulated traffic is HTTP.</p>
            <figure>
            
            <img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4a80AwmzUmUyxx7q8j2hcK/c2bcd1903e037852e57186510f6bac58/image2-2.png" alt="Recursive processing of HTTP CONNECT body payload in HTTP pipeline" width="1999" height="685" loading="lazy">
            
            </figure><p><i>Recursive processing of HTTP CONNECT body payload in HTTP pipeline</i></p>
    <p>
      <h3 id="tls">TLS</h3>
      
    </p>
    <p>The modern Internet is unimaginable without traffic encryption, and Oxy, of course, provides this essential aspect. Oxy's cryptography and TLS are based on BoringSSL, providing both a FIPS-compliant version with a limited set of certified features and the latest version that supports all the currently available TLS features. Oxy also allows applications to switch between the two versions in real-time, on a per-request or per-connection basis.</p><p>Oxy's TLS client is designed to make HTTPS requests to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstream_server">upstream servers</a>, with the functionality and security of a browser-grade client. This includes the reconstruction of certificate chains, certificate revocation checks, and more. In addition, Oxy applications can be secured with TLS v1.3, and optionally mTLS, allowing for the extraction of client authentication information from x509 certificates.</p><p>Oxy has the ability to inspect and filter HTTPS traffic, including HTTP/3, and provides the means for dynamically generating certificates, serving as a foundation for implementing data loss prevention (DLP) products. Additionally, Oxy's internal fork of BoringSSL, which is not FIPS-compliant, supports the use of <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7250">raw public keys</a> as an alternative to WebPKI, making it ideal for internal service communication. This allows for all the benefits of TLS without the hassle of managing root certificates.</p>
    <p>
      <h3 id="gluing-everything-together">Gluing everything together</h3>
      
    </p>
    <p>Oxy is more than just a set of building blocks for network applications. It acts as a cohesive glue, handling the bootstrapping of the entire proxy application with ease, including parsing and applying configurations, setting up an asynchronous runtime, applying seccomp hardening and providing automated graceful restarts functionality.</p><p>With built-in support for panic reporting to Sentry, Prometheus metrics with a Rust-macro based API, Kibana logging, distributed tracing, memory and runtime profiling, Oxy offers comprehensive <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/app-performance-monitoring/">monitoring</a> and analysis capabilities. It can also generate detailed audit logs for layer 4 traffic, useful for billing and network analysis.</p><p>To top it off, Oxy includes an integration testing framework, allowing for easy testing of application interactions using TypeScript-based tests.</p>
    <p>
      <h3 id="extensibility-model">Extensibility model</h3>
      
    </p>
    <p>To take full advantage of Oxy's capabilities, one must understand how to extend and configure its features. Oxy applications are configured using YAML configuration files, offering numerous options for each feature. Additionally, application developers can extend these options by leveraging the convenient macros provided by the framework, making customization a breeze.</p><p>Suppose the Oxy application uses a key-value database to retrieve user information. In that case, it would be beneficial to expose a YAML configuration settings section for this purpose. With Oxy, defining a structure and annotating it with the <code>#[oxy_app_settings]</code> attribute is all it takes to accomplish this:</p>
            <pre><code>///Application’s key-value (KV) database settings
#[oxy_app_settings]
pub struct MyAppKVSettings {
    /// Key prefix.
    pub prefix: Option&lt;String&gt;,
    /// Path to the UNIX domain socket for the appropriate KV 
    /// server instance.
    pub socket: Option&lt;String&gt;,
}</code></pre>
            <p>Oxy can then generate a default YAML configuration file listing available options and their default values, including those extended by the application. The configuration options are automatically documented in the generated file from the Rust doc comments, following best Rust practices.</p><p>Moreover, Oxy supports multi-tenancy, allowing a single application instance to expose multiple on-ramp endpoints, each with a unique configuration. But, sometimes even a YAML configuration file is not enough to build a desired application, this is where Oxy's comprehensive set of hooks comes in handy. These hooks can be used to extend the application with Rust code and cover almost all aspects of the traffic processing.</p><p>To give you an idea of how easy it is to write an Oxy application, here is an example of basic Oxy code:</p>
            <pre><code>struct MyApp;

// Defines types for various application extensions to Oxy's
// data types. Contexts provide information and control knobs for
// the different parts of the traffic flow and applications can extend // all of them with their custom data. As was mentioned before,
// applications could also define their custom configuration.
// It’s just a matter of defining a configuration object with
// `#[oxy_app_settings]` attribute and providing the object type here.
impl OxyExt for MyApp {
    type AppSettings = MyAppKVSettings;
    type EndpointAppSettings = ();
    type EndpointContext = ();
    type IngressConnectionContext = MyAppIngressConnectionContext;
    type RequestContext = ();
    type IpTunnelContext = ();
    type DnsCacheItem = ();

}
   
#[async_trait]
impl OxyApp for MyApp {
    fn name() -&gt; &amp;'static str {
        "My app"
    }

    fn version() -&gt; &amp;'static str {
        env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION")
    }

    fn description() -&gt; &amp;'static str {
        "This is an example of Oxy application"
    }

    async fn start(
        settings: ServerSettings&lt;MyAppSettings, ()&gt;
    ) -&gt; anyhow::Result&lt;Hooks&lt;Self&gt;&gt; {
        // Here the application initializes various hooks, with each
        // hook being a trait implementation containing multiple
        // optional callbacks invoked during the lifecycle of the
        // traffic processing.
        let ingress_hook = create_ingress_hook(&amp;settings);
        let egress_hook = create_egress_hook(&amp;settings);
        let tunnel_hook = create_tunnel_hook(&amp;settings);
        let http_request_hook = create_http_request_hook(&amp;settings);
        let ip_flow_hook = create_ip_flow_hook(&amp;settings);

        Ok(Hooks {
            ingress: Some(ingress_hook),
            egress: Some(egress_hook),
            tunnel: Some(tunnel_hook),
            http_request: Some(http_request_hook),
            ip_flow: Some(ip_flow_hook),
            ..Default::default()
        })
    }
}

// The entry point of the application
fn main() -&gt; OxyResult&lt;()&gt; {
    oxy::bootstrap::&lt;MyApp&gt;()
}</code></pre>

      <h2 id="technology-choice">Technology choice</h2>
      
    </p>
    <p>Oxy leverages the safety and performance benefits of Rust as its implementation language. At Cloudflare, Rust has emerged as a popular choice for new product development, and there are ongoing efforts to migrate some of the existing products to the language as well.</p><p>Rust offers memory and concurrency safety through its ownership and borrowing system, preventing issues like null pointers and data races. This safety is achieved without sacrificing performance, as Rust provides low-level control and the ability to write code with minimal runtime overhead. Rust's balance of safety and performance has made it popular for building safe performance-critical applications, like proxies.</p><p>We intentionally tried to stand on the shoulders of the giants with this project and avoid reinventing the wheel. Oxy heavily relies on open-source dependencies, with <a href="https://github.com/hyperium/hyper">hyper</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio">tokio</a> being the backbone of the framework. Our philosophy is that we should pull from existing solutions as much as we can, allowing for faster iteration, but also use widely battle-tested code. If something doesn't work for us, we try to collaborate with maintainers and contribute back our fixes and improvements. In fact, we now have two team members who are core team members of tokio and hyper projects.</p><p>Even though Oxy is a proprietary project, we try to give back some love to the open-source community without which the project wouldn’t be possible by open-sourcing some of the building blocks such as <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/boring">https://github.com/cloudflare/boring</a> and <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche">https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche</a>.</p>
    <p>
      <h2 id="the-road-to-implementation">The road to implementation</h2>
      
    </p>
    <p>At the beginning of our journey, we set out to implement a proof-of-concept &nbsp;for an HTTP firewall using Rust for what would eventually become Zero Trust Gateway product. This project was originally part of the <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/1111-warp-better-vpn/">WARP</a> service repository. However, as the PoC rapidly advanced, it became clear that it needed to be separated into its own Gateway proxy for both technical and operational reasons.</p><p>Later on, when tasked with implementing a relay proxy for iCloud Private Relay, we saw the opportunity to reuse much of the code from the Gateway proxy. The Gateway project could also benefit from the HTTP/3 support that was being added for the Private Relay project. In fact, early iterations of the relay service were forks of the Gateway server.</p><p>It was then that we realized we could extract common elements from both projects to create a new framework, Oxy. The history of Oxy can be traced back to its origins in the commit history of the Gateway and Private Relay projects, up until its separation as a standalone framework.</p><p>Since our inception, we have leveraged the power of Oxy to efficiently roll out multiple projects that would have required a significant amount of time and effort without it. Our iterative development approach has been a strength of the project, as we have been able to identify common, reusable components through hands-on testing and implementation.</p><p>Our small core team is supplemented by internal contributors from across the company, ensuring that the best subject-matter experts are working on the relevant parts of the project. This contribution model also allows us to shape the framework's API to meet the functional and ergonomic needs of its users, while the core team ensures that the project stays on track.</p>
    <p>
      <h2 id="relation-to">Relation to <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-we-built-pingora-the-proxy-that-connects-cloudflare-to-the-internet/">Pingora</a></h2>
      
    </p>
    <p>Although Pingora, another proxy server developed by us in Rust, shares some similarities with Oxy, it was intentionally designed as a separate proxy server with a different objective. Pingora was created to serve traffic from millions of our client’s upstream servers, including those with ancient and unusual configurations. Non-UTF 8 URLs or TLS settings that are not supported by most TLS libraries being just a few such quirks among many others. This focus on handling technically challenging unusual configurations sets Pingora apart from other proxy servers.</p><p>The concept of Pingora came about during the same period when we were beginning to develop Oxy, and we initially considered merging the two projects. However, we quickly realized that their objectives were too different to do that. Pingora is specifically designed to establish Cloudflare’s HTTP connectivity with the Internet, even in its most technically obscure corners. On the other hand, Oxy is a multipurpose platform that supports a wide variety of communication protocols and aims to provide a simple way to develop high-performance proxy applications with business logic.</p>
    <p>
      <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
      
    </p>
    <p>Oxy is a proxy framework that we have developed to meet the demanding needs of modern services. It has been designed &nbsp;to provide a flexible and scalable solution that can be adapted to meet the unique requirements of each project and by leveraging the power of Rust, we made it both safe and fast.</p><p>Looking forward, Oxy is poised to play one of the critical roles in our company's larger effort to modernize and improve our architecture. It provides a solid block in foundation on which we can keep building the better Internet.</p><p>As the framework continues to evolve and grow, we remain committed to our iterative approach to development, constantly seeking out new opportunities to reuse existing solutions and improve our codebase. This collaborative, community-driven approach has already yielded impressive results, and we are confident that it will continue to drive the future success of Oxy.</p><p>Stay tuned for more tech savvy blog posts on the subject!</p></div></section><div><p>Cloudflare's connectivity cloud protects <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/network-services/" rel="noreferrer">entire corporate networks</a>, helps customers build <a target="_blank" href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/" rel="noreferrer">Internet-scale applications efficiently</a>, accelerates any <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/performance/accelerate-internet-applications/" rel="noreferrer">website or Internet application</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/ddos/" rel="noreferrer">wards off DDoS attacks</a>, keeps <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/application-security/" rel="noreferrer">hackers at bay</a>, and can help you on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/" rel="noreferrer">your journey to Zero Trust</a>.</p><p>Visit <a target="_blank" href="https://one.one.one.one/" rel="noreferrer">1.1.1.1</a> from any device to get started with our free app that makes your Internet faster and safer.</p><p>To learn more about our mission to help build a better Internet, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/what-is-cloudflare/" rel="noreferrer">start here</a>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
             

            <div><p><em>For New York’s No 1 Socialite, </em><a href="https://x.com/chengela?ref=atvbt.com" rel="noreferrer"><em>Angela.</em></a></p><p>1) Prioritize your ease of being over any other consideration: parties are like babies, if you’re stressed while holding them they’ll get stressed too. Every other decision is downstream of your serenity: e.g. it's better to have mediocre pizza from a happy host than fabulous hors d'oeuvres from a frazzled one.</p><p>2) Advertise your start time as a quarter-to the hour. If you start an event at 2:00, people won't arrive till 2:30; if you make it 1:45, people will arrive at 2:00.</p><p>3) Invite a few close friends to come 30-60 mins earlier to set up / eat dinner with you / hang out / whatever, so that when the start time approaches you’re already having fun instead of stressing that nobody will come.</p></div><p>4) Most people will only go to a party where they expect to know 3+ others already. </p><p>5) Use an app like Partiful or Luma that shows the guest list to invitees. Start by inviting your closest friends, get some yesses, then expand from there.</p><p>6) Send the invites in chat groups (or visibly cc’ed emails) to clusters of 4-5 people who know each other, so they can see that their friends are also going.</p><p>7) When inviting people individually, namedrop mutual friends who are invited or coming.</p><p>8) In a small group, the quality of the experience will depend a lot on whether the various friends blend together well. Follow your instinct on this, even if your instinct feels rude. It’s like cooking a dish, two ingredients can each be fabulous and still not go well together.</p><p>9) A large party is more like an Everything Soup: you mainly need to avoid ingredients that ruin the flavor for everyone else; beyond that you can mostly throw in whatever and see what works.</p><p>10) Regardless, try not to feel bad about not-inviting someone if your heart says they would make the party less-fun for others. Make peace with gatekeeping because if you don't exclude a small % of people you will ultimately lose everyone else. Someone can be a good person and a bad fit for your party, so don't think of it as a judgement on their soul. All of this is easier in theory than in practice.</p><p>11) Most events are better when roughly gender-balanced. Prioritize inviting people of the gender you’d likely have fewer of, then top up invites with the other. Once an event crosses a threshold (maybe 70%?) of male-or-female dominance, most people of the other gender are likely to decline (or just not-come to your next party) as a result. So there's ultimately two equilibria, "roughly gender balanced" and "extremely uncomfortably unbalanced," and you need to stay in the attraction basin for balance. To do this, keep your invite ratio at worst 60-40 in either direction, in order to prevent a downward spiral.</p><p>12) Co-host parties with someone you like a lot but who isn't in your exact social circle, so that your two friend-sets can intermingle.</p><p>13) Figure out the flake rate in your social circles (the % of people who will RSVP yes and flake on the day), and set your invite numbers with that in mind.&nbsp; In my circles, consistently 1/3rd of people who say they will be there will actually not. </p><p>14) Couples often flake together. This changes the probability distribution of attendees considerably, and so your chance of losing a quorum in a small-group setting. Small-group couple-events (e.g. 3-4 couple dinner parties) are very hard to manage in a high-flake society, as a result.</p><p>15) Create as much circulation at your party as you can. People circulate more when standing than when sitting, so try to encourage standing for those who can e.g. by having high-top tables, or taking away chairs from around tables, or leaving shelves and counter-tops open for people to rest their plates and drinks.</p><p>16) Put the food in one part of the room and the drinks in another, or spread the food and drinks out around the space, so that people have lots of excuses to move around the room.</p><p>17) If someone arrives at your party and doesn’t know anybody, welcome them and then place them with another group or person. Ideally you can pick someone they’d specifically get along well with, at second-best just someone who’s friendly and easy to talk to, but ultimately you can just insert them in any group that’s nearby and open. The main point is to prevent them having to butt in on strangers themselves, which for many people is mortifying, while your Host Privilege allows you to do it for them.</p><p>18) To leave a group conversation, just slowly step back and then step away. Don't draw attention to your leaving or you’ll be pulled back in. It feels mildly weird to do this but it’s worth it. </p><p>19) Throughout the party, prioritize introducing people to each other and hosting the people who are new or shy, even at the cost of getting less time hanging out with your best friends yourself. Parties are a public service, and the guests will (hopefully) pay you back for this by inviting you to parties of their own.</p><p>20) Let me repeat that: Parties are a public service, you’re doing people a favor by throwing them. Someone might meet their new best friend or future lover at your gathering. In the short term, lovely people may feel less lonely, and that's thanks to you. In the long term, whole new children may ultimately exist in the world because you bothered to throw a party. Throwing parties is stressful for most people, but a great kindness to the community, so genuinely pat yourself on the back for doing this.</p><p>21) The biggest problem at many parties is an endless escalation of volume. If you know how to fix this, let me know.</p><div><p>💡</p><p>Look I'm sorry but I must plug: the <i><em>best</em></i> way to throw a party is to buy my party game <a href="https://want.persondothing.com/?ref=atvbt.com" rel="noreferrer">Person Do Thing</a>, for fans of games like Charades, Taboo and Monikers.</p></div>

<p>It’s fair to say that few of us now mar­vel at mov­ing walk­ways, those stan­dard infra­struc­tur­al ele­ments of such util­i­tar­i­an spaces as air­port ter­mi­nals, sub­way sta­tions, and big-box stores. But there was a time when they astound­ed even res­i­dents of one of the most cos­mopoli­tan cities in the world. The inno­va­tion of the mov­ing side­walk demon­strat­ed at the Paris Expo­si­tion of 1900 (pre­vi­ous­ly seen here on Open Cul­ture when we fea­tured <a href="http://www.openculture.com/2018/12/pristine-footage-lets-you-revisit-life-in-paris-in-the-1890s.html">Lumière Broth­ers footage of that peri­od</a>) com­mand­ed even Thomas Edis­on’s atten­tion. As <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/moving-sidewalks-before-the-jetsons-17484942/" rel="nofollow">Pale­o­fu­ture’s Matt Novak tells it at <em>Smith­son­ian&nbsp;</em>mag­a­zine</a>, “Thomas Edi­son sent one of his pro­duc­ers, James Hen­ry White, to the Expo­si­tion and Mr. White shot at least 16 movies,” a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2tmmIQm5x8">clip of which footage</a> you can see above.</p>
<p>White “had brought along a new pan­ning-head tri­pod that gave his films a new­found sense of free­dom and flow. Watch­ing the film, you can see chil­dren jump­ing into frame and even a man doff­ing his cap to the cam­era, pos­si­bly aware that he was being cap­tured by an excit­ing new tech­nol­o­gy while a fun nov­el­ty of the future chugs along under his feet.”</p>


<p>Novak also includes hand-col­ored pho­tographs from the Paris Exhi­bi­tion and quotes a&nbsp;<em>New York Observ­er</em> cor­re­spon­dent describ­ing the mov­ing side­walk as a “nov­el­ty” con­sist­ing of “three ele­vat­ed plat­forms, the first being sta­tion­ary, the sec­ond mov­ing at a mod­er­ate rate of speed, and the third at the rate of about six miles an hour.” Thus “the cir­cuit of the Expo­si­tion can be made with rapid­i­ty and ease by this con­trivance. It also affords a good deal of fun, for most of the vis­i­tors are unfa­mil­iar with this mode of tran­sit, and are awk­ward in its use.”</p>

	</p>
</div>

<p>Novak fea­tures con­tem­po­rary images of the Paris Exhi­bi­tion’s mov­ing side­walk <a href="https://paleofuture.com/blog/2013/8/13/rare-photos-of-pariss-mechanical-moving-sidewalks-from-1900">at Pale­o­fu­ture</a>, found in the book&nbsp;<a href="https://amzn.to/2xf3ZD4"><em>Paris</em> <em>Expo­si­tion Repro­duced From the Offi­cial Pho­tographs</em><span>.</span></a>&nbsp;Its authors describe the <em>trot­toir roulant&nbsp;</em>as “a detached struc­ture like a rail­way train, arriv­ing at and pass­ing cer­tain points at stat­ed times” with­out a break. “In engi­neers’ lan­guage, it is an ‘end­less floor’ raised thir­ty feet above the lev­el of the ground, ever and ever glid­ing along the four sides of the square — a wood­en ser­pent with its tail in its mouth.” But the his­to­ry of the mov­ing walk­way did­n’t start in Paris:&nbsp;“In 1871 inven­tor Alfred Speer patent­ed a sys­tem of mov­ing side­walks that he thought would rev­o­lu­tion­ize pedes­tri­an trav­el in New York City,” as Novak notes, and the first one actu­al­ly built was built for Chicago’s 1893 Columbian Expo­si­tion — but it cost a nick­el to ride and “was unde­pend­able and prone to break­ing down,” mak­ing Paris’ ver­sion the more impres­sive spec­ta­cle.</p>

<p>Still, the Columbian Expo­si­tion’s vis­i­tors must have got a kick out of glid­ing down the pier with­out hav­ing to do the walk­ing them­selves. You can learn more about this first mov­ing walk­way and its suc­ces­sors, the one at the Paris Exhi­bi­tion includ­ed, from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMlLPgAL2h0">the Lit­tle Car video above</a>. How­ev­er much these ear­ly mod­els may look like quaint turn-of-the cen­tu­ry nov­el­ties, some still see in the tech­nol­o­gy gen­uine promise for the future of pub­lic tran­sit. Mov­ing walk­ways work well, <a href="https://www.treehugger.com/public-transportation/paris-had-marvellous-moving-sidewalk-1900.html">writes Tree­hug­ger’s Lloyd Alter</a>, “when the walk­ing dis­tance and time is just a bit too long.” And they remind us that “trans­porta­tion should be about more than just get­ting from A to B; it should be a plea­sure as well.” Parisians “kept the Eif­fel Tow­er from the exhi­bi­tion” — it had been built for the 1889 World’s Fair — but “it is too bad they did­n’t keep this, a sort of mov­ing High Line that is both trans­porta­tion and enter­tain­ment.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
												<p>A Ukrainian man indicted in 2012 for conspiring with a prolific hacking group to steal tens of millions of dollars from U.S. businesses was arrested in Italy and is now in custody in the United States, KrebsOnSecurity has learned.</p>
<p>Sources close to the investigation say <strong>Yuriy Igorevich Rybtsov</strong>, a 41-year-old from the Russia-controlled city of Donetsk, Ukraine, was previously referenced in U.S. federal charging documents only by his online handle “<strong>MrICQ</strong>.” According to <a href="https://www.justice.gov/iso/opa/resources/2162014411104532407242.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 13-year-old indictment</a> (PDF) filed by prosecutors in Nebraska, MrICQ was a developer for a cybercrime group known as “<strong>Jabber Zeus</strong>.”</p>
<div id="attachment_72498"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-72498" decoding="async" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/rybtsov-lockedup.png" alt="" width="749" height="678" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/rybtsov-lockedup.png 861w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/rybtsov-lockedup-768x695.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/rybtsov-lockedup-782x708.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-72498">Image: lockedup dot wtf.</p></div>
<p>The Jabber Zeus name is derived from the malware they used — a custom version of the <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=zeus+trojan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ZeuS banking trojan</a> — that stole banking login credentials and would send the group a Jabber instant message each time a new victim entered a one-time passcode at a financial institution website. The gang targeted mostly small to mid-sized businesses, and they were an early pioneer of so-called “man-in-the-browser” attacks, malware that can silently intercept any data that victims submit in a web-based form.</p>
<p>Once inside a victim company’s accounts, the Jabber Zeus crew would modify the firm’s payroll to add dozens of “money mules,” people recruited through elaborate work-at-home schemes to handle bank transfers. The mules in turn would forward any stolen payroll deposits — minus their commissions — via wire transfers to other mules in Ukraine and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>The 2012 indictment&nbsp;targeting the Jabber Zeus crew named MrICQ as “<strong>John Doe #3</strong>,” and said this person handled incoming notifications of newly compromised victims. The Department of Justice (DOJ) said MrICQ also helped the group launder the proceeds of their heists through electronic currency exchange services.</p>
<p>Two sources familiar with the Jabber Zeus investigation said Rybtsov was arrested in Italy, although the exact date and circumstances of his arrest remain unclear. A <a href="https://www.cortedicassazione.it/resources/cms/documents/Rassegna_mensile_MAGGIO_2025__settore_penale.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">summary of recent decisions</a> (PDF) published by the Italian Supreme Court states that in April 2025, Rybtsov lost a final appeal to avoid extradition to the United States.</p>
<p>According to the mugshot website <strong>lockedup[.]wtf</strong>, Rybtsov arrived in Nebraska on October 9, and was being held under an arrest warrant from the <strong>U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation</strong> (FBI).</p>
<p>The data breach tracking service <a href="https://constella.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Constella Intelligence</a> found breached records from the business profiling site bvdinfo[.]com showing that a 41-year-old Yuriy Igorevich Rybtsov worked in a building at 59 Barnaulska St. in Donetsk. Further searching on this address in Constella finds the same apartment building was shared by a business registered to <strong>Vyacheslav “Tank” Penchukov</strong>, the leader of the Jabber Zeus crew in Ukraine.</p>

<p>Penchukov was <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/11/top-zeus-botnet-suspect-tank-arrested-in-geneva/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arrested in 2022</a> while traveling to meet his wife in Switzerland.

<p><strong>Lawrence Baldwin</strong> is founder of <a href="https://mynetwatchman.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">myNetWatchman</a>, a threat intelligence company based in Georgia that began tracking and disrupting the Jabber Zeus gang in 2009. myNetWatchman had secretly gained access to the Jabber chat server used by the Ukrainian hackers, allowing Baldwin to eavesdrop on the daily conversations between MrICQ and other Jabber Zeus members.</p>
<p>Baldwin shared those real-time chat records with multiple state and federal law enforcement agencies, and with this reporter. Between 2010 and 2013, I spent several hours each day alerting small businesses across the country that their payroll accounts were about to be drained by these cybercriminals.</p>
<p>Those notifications, and Baldwin’s tireless efforts, saved countless would-be victims a great deal of money. In most cases, however, we were already too late. Nevertheless, the pilfered Jabber Zeus group chats provided the basis for dozens of stories published here about <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/smallbizvictims/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">small businesses fighting their banks</a> in court over six- and seven-figure financial losses.</p>
<p>Baldwin said the Jabber Zeus crew was far ahead of its peers in several respects. For starters, their intercepted chats showed they worked to create a highly customized botnet directly with the author of the original Zeus Trojan — <strong>Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev</strong>, a Russian man who has long been on the FBI’s “Most Wanted” list. The feds have a <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/02/fbi-3m-bounty-for-zeus-trojan-author/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">standing $3 million reward</a> for information leading to Bogachev’s arrest.</p>
<div id="attachment_49974"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-49974" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bogachev.png" alt="" width="743" height="456"></p><p id="caption-attachment-49974">Evgeniy M. Bogachev, in undated photos.</p></div>
<p>The core innovation of Jabber Zeus was an alert that MrICQ would receive each time a new victim entered a one-time password code into a phishing page mimicking their financial institution. The gang’s internal name for this component was “<strong>Leprechaun</strong>,” (the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiAg3puABeA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video below</a> from myNetWatchman shows it in action). Jabber Zeus would actually re-write the HTML code as displayed in the victim’s browser, allowing them to intercept any passcodes sent by the victim’s bank for multi-factor authentication.</p>
<p>“These guys had compromised such a large number of victims that they were getting buried in a tsunami of stolen banking credentials,” Baldwin told KrebsOnSecurity. “But the whole point of Leprechaun was to isolate the highest-value credentials — the commercial bank accounts with two-factor authentication turned on. They knew these were far juicier targets because they clearly had a lot more money to protect.”</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UiAg3puABeA?si=pEHck5AXQ5mBKhz9" width="740" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Baldwin said the Jabber Zeus trojan also included a custom “backconnect” component that allowed the hackers to relay their bank account takeovers through the victim’s own infected PC.</p>
<p>“The Jabber Zeus crew were literally connecting to the victim’s bank account from the victim’s IP address, or from the remote control function and by fully emulating the device,” he said. “That trojan was like a hot knife through butter of what everyone thought was state-of-the-art secure online banking at the time.”</p>
<p>Although the Jabber Zeus crew was in direct contact with the Zeus author, the chats intercepted by myNetWatchman show Bogachev frequently ignored the group’s pleas for help. The government says the real leader of the Jabber Zeus crew was <strong>Maksim Yakubets</strong>, a 38-year Ukrainian man with Russian citizenship who went by the hacker handle “<strong>Aqua</strong>.”</p>
<div id="attachment_49935"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-49935" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/yukabets.png" alt="" width="750" height="611"></p><p id="caption-attachment-49935">Alleged Evil Corp leader Maksim “Aqua” Yakubets. Image: FBI</p></div>
<p>The Jabber chats intercepted by Baldwin show that Aqua interacted almost daily with MrICQ, Tank and other members of the hacking team, often facilitating the group’s money mule and cashout activities remotely from Russia.</p>
<p>The government says Yakubets/Aqua would later emerge as the leader of an elite cybercrime ring of at least 17 hackers that referred to themselves internally as “<strong>Evil Corp</strong>.” Members of Evil Corp developed and used the <strong>Dridex</strong> (a.k.a. <strong>Bugat</strong>) trojan, which helped them siphon more than $100 million from hundreds of victim companies in the United States and Europe.</p>
<p><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/12/inside-evil-corp-a-100m-cybercrime-menace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This 2019 story about the government’s $5 million bounty</a> for information leading to Yakubets’s arrest includes excerpts of conversations between Aqua, Tank, Bogachev and other Jabber Zeus crew members discussing stories I’d written about their victims. Both Baldwin and I were interviewed at length for a new weekly six-part podcast by the <strong>BBC</strong> that delves deep into the history of Evil Corp. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/audio/play/w3ct89y8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Episode One</a> focuses on the evolution of Zeus, while <a href="https://www.bbc.com/audio/play/w3ct89y9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the second episode</a> centers on an investigation into the group by former FBI agent <strong>Jim Craig</strong>.</p>

<p>LISP has survived for 21 years because it is
an approximate local optimum in the space of programming
languages.  However, it has accumulated some barnacles
that should be scraped off, and some long-standing
opportunities for improvement have been neglected.
It would benefit from some co-operative maintenance
especially in creating and maintaining program libraries.
Computer checked proofs of program correctness are now
possible for pure LISP and some extensions, but more theory
and some smoothing of the language itself are required before
we can take full advantage of LISP's mathematical basis.

1999 note: This article was included in the 1980 Lisp conference held
at Stanford.  Since it almost entirely corresponds to my present
opinions, I should have asked to have it reprinted in the 1998 Lisp
users conference proceedings at which I gave a talk with the same
title.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
						<p>It finally happened. Linux gamers on Steam as of the Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey for October 2025 have crossed over the elusive 3% mark. The trend has been clear for sometime, and with Windows 10 ending support, it was quite likely this was going to be the time for it to happen as more people try out Linux.</p>

<p>As of the October 2025 survey the operating system details:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Windows 94.84% -0.75%</li>
	<li>Linux 3.05% +0.41%</li>
	<li>macOS 2.11% +0.34%</li>
</ul>

<p>The snapshot chart from our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dedicated Steam Tracker page</a> shows the clear trend:</p>

<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1139496631762087838gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1139496631762087838gol1.png"></a></p>

<p>Overall, 3% might not seem like much to some, but again - that trend is very clear and equates to millions of people. The last time Valve officially gave a proper monthly active user count was in 2022, and we know Steam has grown a lot since then, but even going by that original number would put monthly active Linux users at well over 4 million. Sadly, Valve have not given out a more recent monthly active user number but it's likely a few million higher, especially with the Steam Deck selling millions.</p>

<p>And if we look at the distribution breakdown chart from our page:</p>

<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21445529501762087839gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21445529501762087839gol1.png"></a></p>

<p>The overall distribution numbers for October 2025:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>SteamOS Holo 64 bit</strong> - 27.18% (-0.47%)</li>
	<li><strong>Arch Linux 64 bit</strong> - 10.32% (-0.66%)</li>
	<li><strong>Linux Mint 22.2 64 bit</strong> - 6.65% (+6.65%)</li>
	<li><strong>CachyOS 64 bit</strong> - 6.01% (+1.32%)</li>
	<li><strong>Ubuntu Core 22 64 bit</strong> - 4.55% (+0.55%)</li>
	<li><strong>Freedesktop SDK 25.08 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit</strong> - 4.29% (+4.29%)</li>
	<li><strong>Bazzite 64 bit</strong> - 4.24% (+4.24%)</li>
	<li><strong>Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS 64 bit</strong> - 3.70% (+3.70%)</li>
	<li><strong>Linux Mint 22.1 64 bit</strong> - 2.56% (-5.65%)</li>
	<li><strong>EndeavourOS Linux 64 bit</strong> - 2.32% (-0.08%)</li>
	<li><strong>Freedesktop SDK 24.08 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit</strong> - 2.31% (-3.98%)</li>
	<li><strong>Fedora Linux 42 (KDE Plasma Desktop Edition) 64 bit</strong> - 2.12% (+0.19%)</li>
	<li><strong>Manjaro Linux 64 bit</strong> - 2.04% (-0.31%)</li>
	<li><strong>Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS 64 bit</strong> - 1.93% (-0.04%)</li>
	<li><strong>Fedora Linux 42 (Workstation Edition) 64 bit</strong> - 1.75% (-0.43%)</li>
	<li><strong>Other</strong> - 18.04% (-4.28%)</li>
</ul>

<p>The numbers are still being massively pumped up by the Steam Deck with SteamOS Linux, which is not surprising considering that the Steam Deck is still in the top 10 of the global top sellers on Steam constantly. And with all the rumours and leaks surrounding the upcoming Steam Frame, which will hopefully be a SteamOS Linux powered VR kit, we could see the numbers just continue to jump higher.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Oct 30, 2025</p><p>AWS published a post-mortem about a recent outage [1]. Big systems like theirs are complex, and when you operate at that scale, things sometimes go wrong. Still, AWS has an impressive record of reliability.</p><p>The post-mortem mentioned a race condition, which caught my eye. I don’t know all the details of AWS’s internal setup, but using the information in the post-mortem and a few assumptions, we can try to reproduce a simplified version of the problem.</p><p>As a small experiment, we’ll use a model checker to see how such a race could happen. Formal verification can’t prevent every failure, but it helps us think more clearly about correctness and reason about subtle concurrency bugs. For this, we’ll use the Spin model checker, which uses the Promela language.</p><p>There’s a lot of detail in the post-mortem, but for simplicity we’ll focus only on the race-condition aspect. The incident was triggered by a defect in DynamoDB’s automated DNS management system. The components of this system involved in the incident were the DNS Planner, DNS Enactor, and Amazon Route 53 service.</p><p>The DNS Planner creates DNS plans, and the DNS Enactors look for new DNS plans and apply them to the Amazon Route 53 service. Three Enactors operate independently in three different availability zones.</p><p>Here is an illustration showing these components (if the images appear small, please open them in a new browser tab):</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://wyounas.github.io/images/2025-10-30-aws-outage-race-conditions/aws-dns.png" alt="aws dns management system"></p><p>My understanding of how the DNS Enactor works is as follows: it picks up the latest plan and, before applying it, performs a one-time check to ensure the plan is newer than the previously applied one. It then applies the plan and invokes a clean-up process. During the clean-up, it identifies plans significantly older than the one it just applied and deletes them.</p><p>Using the details from the incident report, we could sketch an interleaving that could explain the race condition. Two Enactors running side by side: Enactor 2 applies a new plan and starts cleaning up, while the other, running just a little behind, applies an older plan, making it an active one. When the Enactor 2 finishes its cleanup, it deletes that plan, and the DNS entries disappear. Here’s what that sequence looks like:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://wyounas.github.io/images/2025-10-30-aws-outage-race-conditions/race-condition-interleaving.png" alt="aws dns race condition"></p><p>Let’s try to uncover this interleaving using a model checker.</p><p>In Promela, you can model each part of the system as its own process. Spin then takes those processes, starts from the initial state, and systematically applies every possible transition, exploring all interleavings to build the set of reachable states [2]. It checks that your invariants hold in each one, and if it finds a violation, it reports a counterexample.</p><p>We’ll create a DNS Planner process that produces plans, and DNS Enactor processes that pick them up. The Enactor will check whether the plan it’s about to apply is newer than the previous one, update the state of certain variables to simulate changes in Route 53, and finally clean up the older plans.</p><p>In our simplified model, we’ll run one DNS Planner process and two concurrent DNS Enactor processes. (AWS appears to run three across zones; we abstract that detail here.) The Planner generates plans, and through Promela channels, these plans are sent to the Enactors for processing.</p><p>Inside each DNS Enactor, we track the key aspects of system state. The Enactor keeps the current plan in <em>current_plan</em>, and it represents DNS health using <em>dns_valid</em>. It also records the highest plan applied so far in <em>highest_plan_applied</em>. The incident report also notes that the clean-up process deletes plans that are “significantly older than the one it just applied.” In our model, we capture this by allowing an Enactor to remove only those plans that are much older than its current plan. To simulate the deletion of an active plan, the Enactor’s clean-up process checks whether <em>current_plan</em> equals the plan being deleted. If it does, we simulate the resulting DNS failure by setting <em>dns_valid</em> to false.</p><p>Here’s the code for the DNS Planner:</p><pre><code>active proctype Planner() {
    byte plan = 1;
    
    do
    :: (plan &lt;= MAX_PLAN) -&gt;
        latest_plan = plan;
        plan_channel ! plan; 
        printf("Planner: Generated Plan v%d\n", plan);
        plan++;
    :: (plan &gt; MAX_PLAN) -&gt; break;
    od;
    
    printf("Planner: Completed\n");
}
</code></pre><p>It creates plans and sends them over a channel (<em>plan</em> is being sent to the channel <em>plan_channel</em>) to be picked up later by the DNS Enactor.</p><p>We start two concurrent DNS Enactor processes by specifying the number of enactors after the <em>active</em> keyword.</p><pre><code>active [NUM_ENACTORS] proctype Enactor() 
</code></pre><p>The DNS Enactor waits for plans and receives them (? opertaor receives a plan from the channel <em>plan_channel</em>). It then performs a staleness check, updates the state of certain variables to simulate changes in Route 53, and finally cleans up the older plans.</p><pre><code>:: plan_channel ? my_plan -&gt;
    snapshot_current = current_plan;

    // staleness check    
    if
    :: (my_plan &gt; snapshot_current || snapshot_current == 0) -&gt;

        if
            :: !plan_deleted[my_plan] -&gt;
                /* Apply the plan to Route53 */
                
                current_plan = my_plan;
                dns_valid = true;
                initialized = true;
               /* Track highest plan applied for regression detection */
                if 
                :: (my_plan &gt; highest_plan_applied) -&gt;
                    highest_plan_applied = my_plan;
                fi 
            
            // runs the clean-up process (omitted for brevity, included in the 
            // code linked below)
        fi
    fi

</code></pre><p>How do we discover the race condition? The idea is this: we express as an invariant what must always be true of the system, and then ask the model checker to confirm that it holds in every possible state. In this case, we can set up an invariant stating that the DNS should never be deleted once a newer plan has been applied. (With more information about the real system, we could simplify or refine this rule further.)</p><p>We specify this invariant formally as follows:</p><pre><code>/*

A quick note on some of the keywords used in the invariant below:

ltl - keyword that declares a temporal property to verify (ltl: linear temporal logic lets you specify properties about all possible executions of your program.)

[] - "always" operator (this must be true at every step forever)

-&gt; - "implies" (if left side is true, then right side must be true)

*/

ltl no_dns_deletion_on_regression {
    [] ( (initialized &amp;&amp; highest_plan_applied &gt; current_plan 
            &amp;&amp; current_plan &gt; 0) -&gt; dns_valid )
}



</code></pre><p>When we start the model checker, one DNS Planner process begins generating plans and sending them through channels to the DNS Enactors. Two Enactors receive these plans, perform their checks, apply updates, and run their cleanup routines. As these processes interleave, the model checker systematically builds the set of reachable states, allowing the invariant to be checked in each one.</p><p>When we run the model with this invariant in the model checker, it reports a violation.

</code></pre></div><p>The trail file in the repository below shows how the race happens. The trail file shows that two Enactors operate side by side: the faster one applies plan 4 and starts cleaning up. Because cleanup only removes plans much older than the one just applied, it deletes 1 and 2 but skips 3. The slower Enactor then applies plan 3 and makes it active, and when the faster Enactor picks up cleanup again, it deletes 3 and the DNS goes down.</p><p>Here’s an illustration of the interleaving reconstructed from the trail:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://wyounas.github.io/images/2025-10-30-aws-outage-race-conditions/race-condition-spin-inteleaving.png" alt="aws dns race condition simulated by spin"></p><p>Before publishing, I reread the incident report and noted: “Additionally, because the active plan was deleted, the system was left in an inconsistent state…”. This suggests a direct invariant: the active plan must never be deleted.</p><pre><code>ltl never_delete_active {
    [] ( current_plan &gt; 0 -&gt; !plan_deleted[current_plan] )
}
</code></pre><p>Running the model checker with this invariant produces essentially the same counterexample as before: one Enactor advances to newer plans while the other lags and applies an older plan, thereby making it active. When control returns to the faster Enactor, its cleanup deletes that now-active plan, violating the invariant.</p><p>Invariants are invaluable for establishing correctness. If we can show that an invariant holds in the initial state, in every state reachable from it, and in the final state as well, we gain confidence that the system’s logic is sound.</p><p>To fix the code, we execute the problematic statements atomically. You can find both versions of the code, the one with the race and the fixed one, along with the interleaving trail in the accompanying repository [3]. I’ve included detailed comments to make it self-explanatory, as well as instructions on how to run the model and explore the trail.</p><p>Some of the assumptions in this model are necessarily simplified, since I don’t have access to AWS’s internal design details. Without that context, there will naturally be gaps between this abstraction and the real system. This model was created in a short time frame for experimental purposes. With more time and context, one could certainly build a more accurate and refined version.</p><p><em>Please keep in mind that I’m only human, and there’s a chance this post contains errors.

                <p><em>Sign up for the daily <a href="https://www.cjr.org/email" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>CJR newsletter</strong></a>.</em></p>
                
                
<p>In May 2024, Daniel Ojukwu, a twenty-six-year-old reporter for the Foundation for Investigative Journalism, a Nigerian nonprofit, was grabbed off the streets of Lagos by armed police and bundled into a vehicle. For the next several days, he was held in a cell incommunicado—first in Lagos, and later in the federal capital, Abuja—without being told exactly what he’d been arrested for. “It was more of an abduction,” Ojukwu recalled recently, via WhatsApp. Finally, on the fourth day, the authorities informed him that he was being accused of breaching a 2015 law known as the Cybercrime Act. His violation: an <a href="https://fij.ng/article/special-report-2-weeks-before-end-of-buharis-tenure-special-assistant-adejoke-adefulire-paid-a-restaurant-n147-1m-to-build-classrooms-in-lagos-a-lot-was-amiss/">article he wrote</a> about alleged corruption in the office of the president.</p>



<p>The Cybercrime Act was introduced to combat a growing trend of internet fraud and other criminal activity within Nigeria, but it has instead frequently been used to suppress journalism published online. One provision in particular—Section 24, which made it illegal to publish false information online that was deemed to be “grossly offensive,” “indecent,” or even merely an “annoyance”—has been especially ripe for abuse. In 2019, for instance, Agba Jalingo, a journalist and publisher of <em>CrossRiverWatch</em>, in Nigeria’s Cross River State, was <a href="https://cpj.org/2023/03/nigerian-journalist-agba-jalingo-detained-on-cybercrime-charges/">arrested and charged under Section 24</a> after he published articles accusing the state’s governor of corruption. (He was later <a href="https://cpj.org/2024/07/nigerian-court-acquits-publisher-agba-jalingo-of-cybercrime-charges/">acquitted</a>.) In February 2024, Nigerian lawmakers amended Section 24 to remove some of its most egregious elements, but the new language still makes it illegal, and punishable by up to three years in jail, to “knowingly or intentionally” communicate online anything that is “false, for the purpose of causing a breakdown of law and order [or] posing a threat to life.”</p>



<p>“This vague text is still used to unfairly prosecute journalists, particularly those who regularly publish investigative reports implicating political or institutional forces,” said Sadibou Marong, the sub-Saharan Africa bureau director of Reporters Without Borders. “Authorities are intent on gagging investigative journalism uncovering corruption and governance issues in the country. The continued implementation of this law constitutes a real threat.”</p>



<p>Nigeria is not the only country using laws designed to legitimately combat online misbehavior to instead repress journalism. In neighboring Niger, Abdourahamane Tchiani, who seized power in a coup in 2023, signed an <a href="https://mfwa.org/issues-in-focus/niger-reintroduces-prison-sentences-for-cybercrime/">order amending three articles of the country’s cybercrime law</a> to reinstate prison sentences for “defamation,” “insults,” and the “dissemination of data likely to disturb public order or undermine human dignity” when these offenses are committed electronically. The law, originally enacted in 2019, had previously been softened to remove prison sentences for such offenses, in part owing to <a href="https://monitor.civicus.org/explore/niger-adopts-law-human-rights-defenders-restrictive-cybercrime-law-reviewed/">how the law had been abused</a> to repress journalists.<em> </em>In <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/cybercrime-laws-risk-steady-criminalization-of-journalists-analysts-warn/7989674.html">Pakistan</a>, <a href="https://www.ned.org/big-question-how-are-cybercrime-laws-weaponized-to-legalize-repression-2/">Georgia</a>, and <a href="https://cpj.org/2025/03/new-turkish-law-criminalizes-false-reporting-on-cybersecurity-related-data-leaks/">Turkey</a>, among others, recent laws meant to limit nefarious activity online, or the spread of misinformation, have been used to restrict acts of journalism. <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/08/jordan-new-cybercrimes-law-stifling-freedom-of-expression-one-year-on/">According to Amnesty International</a>, at least fifteen people in <a href="https://rsf.org/en/jordan-s-cybercrime-law-tool-repressing-journalists">Jordan</a> have been prosecuted under a 2023 expansion of the country’s Cybercrimes Law, for offenses ranging from “spreading fake news” to “threatening society peace.”</p>



<p>“Unfortunately, most of the laws being passed will have little effect in actually curbing misinformation, but instead may give governments far more authority to control content they deem false or misleading,” said Gabrielle Lim, a doctoral fellow at the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto, who recently <a href="https://www.cima.ned.org/publication/chilling-legislation/">coauthored a paper</a> tracking the misuse of “fake news” laws around the world. “For some governments, the threat of misinformation provides a convenient justification for censorship. This is compounded by the fact that liberal democracies are also considering or passing similar laws, which can give cover to authoritarian regimes who want to do the same.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Nigeria, more than two dozen journalists have faced prosecution under the Cybercrime Act, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. In most cases, the journalists have been accused of cyberbullying, cyberstalking, or attempting to overthrow the government. On February 16, 2024—two weeks before the amended Cybercrime Act was signed into law—four journalists of <em>The Informant247</em>, an independent online newspaper based in Nigeria’s Kwara State, were <a href="https://cpj.org/2024/02/4-nigerian-journalists-charged-with-cybercrime-defamation-over-fraud-investigation/amp/">arrested</a> and briefly detained after they published a <a href="https://theinformant247.com/just-a-paint-job-inside-kwara-polytechnics-shoddy-project-commissioning-part-1/">two-part investigative</a> <a href="https://theinformant247.com/how-kwara-polytechnic-rector-made-false-claims-about-institutions-financial-status-commissioned-shoddy-uncompleted-projects/">series</a> that alleged a corrupt atmosphere at a state-run polytechnic institute. “The experience was profoundly disturbing,” said Salihu Ayatullahi, the publication’s editor in chief and one of the arrested journalists. “We were locked in a dark, cramped cell with hardened criminals. The psychological impact was heavier than the physical discomfort: I couldn’t sleep, not because of the poor conditions, but because I couldn’t stop thinking about how broken our system had become and how the corrupt could illegally summon the police to punish those who expose them.” The case was dismissed eleven months later without any evidence presented against the reporters.</p>




<p>Solomon Okedara, a Nigerian digital rights lawyer and researcher, notes that the use of the Cybercrime Act has created a chilling effect in the nation’s civic space. “It is even more worrisome that most of the time, the prosecution cannot establish ingredients of the offense to the point of conviction,” Okedara said. “Knowing a fellow journalist has faced arrest, harassment, and detention, or endless trials, can force others to drop an investigative story idea.”</p>



<p>Despite their ordeals, both Ojukwu and Ayatullahi say they are more determined than ever to use their craft to hold public officials accountable. “As a journalist, the whole experience has made me understand that there is more work to do,” Ojukwu said. “And since there is no limit to which the corrupt are willing to go, there is also none for me.<em> </em>The Cybercrime Act remains a thorn in the flesh of journalists in Nigeria.”</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>People rant about having to learn algorithmic questions for interviews. I get it — interview system is broken, but you ought to learn binary search at least.</p>

<p>Anyways, yet again I came across a real life application of Algorithms. This time in the OG tool <code>git</code>. <code>git bisect - Use binary search to find the commit that introduced a bug</code> <a href="https://kevin3010.github.io/git/2025/11/02/](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect)">ref</a>. And Leetcode wanted you to know it <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/first-bad-version/description/?envType=problem-list-v2&amp;envId=binary-search">First Bad Version</a></p>

<p>We use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo">monorepo</a> at work. And people tend to make hundreds, if not thousands, commit in a single repo a day. On this day, our tests started failing, and the logs weren’t enough to debug or trace the root cause. The failing method depended on a configuration file that made a remote call using a specific role to obtain a token for running the tests. At some point, that configuration had been changed — a string was updated to reference a different account — which caused the failure.</p>

<p>Somehow, the bad change slipped through integration tests unnoticed. It was difficult to manually find the exact file or commit that introduced the issue since many commits had been made across the repository over the past few days.</p>

<p>That’s when a teammate from another team — who was facing the same test failures — ran a few “magical” commands and quickly identified the exact commit where things started to break. The basic idea was simple but brilliant: pick a known good commit and a known bad one, then run a binary search to find the exact commit that caused the failure.</p>

<p>It took a while since each test run was time-consuming, but eventually, it pinpointed the precise commit that introduced the issue. And sure enough, after reverting that commit, everything went back to green.</p>

<p>Here’s a small demo repository that shows how <code>git bisect</code> finds the first bad commit.</p>

<p>File tree:</p>

<div><pre><code>git-bisect-demo/
├── calc.py           # the library under test
├── test_calc.py      # a pytest test for calc.add
└── test_script.sh    # wrapper used by `git bisect run`
</code></pre></div>

<p>Good version of <code>calc.py</code> (commit where tests pass):</p>

<div><pre><code>def add(a, b):
    return a + b

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(add(2, 3))
</code></pre></div>

<p>Bad version of <code>calc.py</code> (commit that introduced the bug):</p>

<div><pre><code>def add(a, b):
    # accidental string concatenation when inputs are coerced to str
    return str(a) + str(b)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(add(2, 3))
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>test_calc.py</code> (pytest):</p>

<div><pre><code>import calc

def test_add():
    assert calc.add(2, 3) == 5, "Addition failed!"
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>test_script.sh</code> — used by <code>git bisect run</code> to return exit code 0 on success and non-zero on failure:</p>

<div><pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -e
pytest -q
</code></pre></div>

<p>Example commit history (chronological):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Commit 1: Initial commit (good)</li>
  <li>Commit 2: Small refactor (still good)</li>
  <li>Commit 3: Bug introduced (bad)</li>
  <li>Commits 4..10: Non-functional edits / comments (remain bad)</li>
</ul>

<p>We can run <code>git bisect</code> like this:</p>

<div><pre><code>git bisect start
git bisect bad HEAD
git bisect good HEAD~9
git bisect run ./test_script.sh
</code></pre></div>

<div><pre><code>status: waiting for both good and bad commits
