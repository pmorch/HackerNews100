<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p dir="ltr">The continued importance of cloud-native applications in an AI and hybrid cloud-centric world demands an open, more accessible ecosystem of development tools. Today, we’re pleased to help drive cloud-native evolution further into the next-generation of IT with our intent to contribute a comprehensive set of container tools to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), including&nbsp;<a href="https://containers.github.io/bootc/">bootc</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://buildah.io/">Buildah</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/containers/composefs">Composefs</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://podman.io/">Podman</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://podman-desktop.io/">Podman Desktop</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/containers/skopeo">Skopeo</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Upon acceptance by the CNCF, the contributed tools will become hosted projects – alongside technologies like Kubernetes, Prometheus, Helm and many more – and part of a vendor-neutral foundation aligned with the projects’ technical interests. The tools will start as Sandbox projects, allowing end-users to contribute, collaborate, grow the project communities and mature the technology.</p><p dir="ltr">While already popular tools with strong user bases - with Podman Desktop having been downloaded more than 1.5 million times and Podman having 23.6k GitHub Stars - we believe as CNCF-hosted projects, these tools will continue to meet the needs of developers today while paving the way for container technologies to grow organically and evolve to meet the dynamic needs of tomorrow.</p><h2 dir="ltr">End-to-end open innovation</h2><p dir="ltr">Artificial intelligence is exposing technological and operational gaps in the technology industry more than ever. To meet the changing needs of developers, Red Hat has been working to not only drive innovation at the workload level -- but also into core functions to better enable end-users to build and run these advanced and intelligent workloads.</p><p dir="ltr">Containers are a fundamental part of these workloads, existing at the center of today’s cloud-native infrastructure with Linux forming the core of each respective container. Through the contribution of these cloud-native container tools, users have better and more consistent access between Linux and Kubernetes. With Linux as the foundation, these tools provide users an end-to-end cloud-native stack to build, deploy and manage containers at scale across the hybrid cloud.</p><p dir="ltr">Customers who use&nbsp;<a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux">Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)</a> can utilize Podman, Buildah, Skopeo and more, knowing they are optimized for RHEL and RHEL supports them in production. The contributed container tools are the building blocks many cloud-native workloads rely on and Red Hat is committed to each project’s future as an open source technology, bringing flexibility, accessibility and enhanced security features to container development.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Guiding the next generation of cloud-native through collaboration</h2><p dir="ltr">Open source is at the heart of everything Red Hat does, and we believe making the code available is just the first step. It’s the collaboration that truly defines open source and leads to groundbreaking innovation. Newer workloads are forcing application developers to innovate in ways that open source is uniquely positioned to help guide.</p><p dir="ltr">Projects like Podman are at the center of this innovation for container technologies and&nbsp; Podman Desktop makes it accessible to the developers. That is why, while already a popular project, Podman is being submitted for contribution at the Sandbox level. Podman as a Sandbox project allows for the community to grow organically, fostering collaboration and growing the diversity of contributors and maintainers - ultimately making it a stronger technology. We believe the CNCF is the place to make this innovation happen in the open.</p><p dir="ltr">More information about these projects, including how to get involved, is below:</p><h3 dir="ltr">Podman, Buildah, &amp; Skopeo</h3><p dir="ltr">Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/containers/podman">https://github.com/containers/podman</a><br>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/containers/buildah">https://github.com/containers/buildah</a><br>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/containers/skopeo">https://github.com/containers/skopeo</a><br>Community:&nbsp;<a href="https://podman.io/community">https://podman.io/community</a>&nbsp;</p><h3 dir="ltr">Podman Desktop</h3><p dir="ltr">Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/podman-desktop/podman-desktop">https://github.com/podman-desktop/podman-desktop</a><br>Community:&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/x5GzFF6QH4">https://discord.com/invite/x5GzFF6QH4</a></p><h3 dir="ltr">Bootc</h3><p dir="ltr">Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/containers/bootc">https://github.com/containers/bootc</a><br>Community:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/containers/bootc/discussions">https://github.com/containers/bootc/discussions</a><br>Matrix:&nbsp;<a href="https://matrix.to/#/#bootc:fedoraproject.org">https://matrix.to/#/#bootc:fedoraproject.org</a></p>

<ul>
<li>O2 has created human-like AI ‘Granny’ to answer calls in real time from fraudsters, keeping them on the phone and away from customers for as long as possible</li>
<li>Trained using cutting-edge technology and real scambaiter content, lifelike ‘Daisy’ is indistinguishable from a real person, fooling scammers into thinking they’ve found a perfect target when really, she’s beating them at their own horrible game</li>
<li>Former Love Islander and scam victim, Amy Hart, is working with ‘Daisy’ and has made a shocking new video to expose fraudsters’ crooked tactics and help O2 customers swerve the scammers</li>
<li>With Daisy revealing how you’re not always speaking to the person you think you are, O2 is urging customers to remain vigilant, leave ‘scambaiting’ to the AI experts and report suspected fraudulent calls and texts for free to <em>7726</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>O2 has today unveiled the newest member&nbsp;of its fraud prevention team, ‘Daisy’. As ‘Head of Scammer Relations’, this state-of-the-art AI Granny’s mission is to talk with fraudsters and waste as much of their time as possible with human-like rambling chat to keep them away from real people, while highlighting the need for consumers to stay vigilant as the UK faces a fraud epidemic.</strong></p>
<p>Created using a range of cutting-edge AI technology and trained with the help of one of YouTube’s best known scambaiters, Jim Browning, Daisy is a lifelike AI Granny completely indistinguishable from a real person. Able to interact with scammers in real time without any input from her creators, O2 has put Daisy to work around the clock answering dodgy calls.</p>
<p>Daisy combines various AI models which work together to listen and respond to fraudulent calls instantaneously and is so lifelike it has successfully kept numerous fraudsters on calls for 40 minutes at a time.</p>
<p>As part of Virgin Media O2’s ongoing “Swerve the Scammers” campaign, Scambaiter Daisy has been created in response to new research from O2 revealing 7 in 10 (71%) of Brits would like to get their own back against scammers that have tried to trick them or their loved ones. However, not wanting to waste their own time ranked as the top reason why the public wouldn’t bait scammers themselves (53%).</p>
<p>With more than two thirds of Brits (67%) concerned about being the target of fraud and one in five (22%) experiencing a fraud attempt every single week, O2 is fighting back.</p>
<p>After several weeks of taking calls in the run up to International Fraud Awareness Week (November 17-23), the AI Scambaiter has told frustrated scammers meandering stories of her family, talked at length about her passion for knitting and provided exasperated callers with false personal information including made-up bank details. By tricking the criminals into thinking they were defrauding a real person and playing on scammers biases about older people, Daisy has prevented them from targeting real victims and, most importantly, has exposed the common tactics used so customers can better protect themselves</p>
<p><strong>Influencer and reality TV star, Amy Hart,</strong> has worked with Daisy to produce a shocking video to show how she’s taking on phoney fraudsters like the one who targeted her. After receiving a call from someone who said they were calling from her bank on the morning of her friend’s wedding, Amy fell victim to a scam which saw more than £5,000 drained from her bank account in a matter of minutes.</p>
<p>The harrowing experience has left Amy passionate about spreading the word on scams and exposing their tactics to help keep others safe. Watch the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV_SdCfZ-0s">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Amy Hart said </em></strong><em>“I know first-hand just how sophisticated nasty fraudsters can be, that’s why I’ve teamed up with O2 and AI Scambaiter Daisy to take the fight back to them, keeping them busy with calls going nowhere. </em></p>
<p><em>“But whilst I love a wind up, it’s scary to see the lengths scammers go to steal everything from passwords to bank details regardless of who they’re speaking to. Whether you’re young or old, anyone can be a victim of a scam that’s why we can never be too careful when it comes to unexpected calls or texts. </em></p>
<p><em>“If you have even the tiniest doubt about who you’re speaking to, the best thing to do is to hang up the phone and call back on a trusted number.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Murray Mackenzie, Director of Fraud at Virgin Media O2, said: </strong><em>“We’re committed to playing our part in stopping the scammers, investing in everything from firewall technology to block out scam texts to AI-powered spam call detection to keep our customers safe.</em></p>
<p><em>“The newest member of our fraud-prevention team, Daisy, is turning the tables on scammers – outsmarting and outmanoeuvring them at their own cruel game simply by keeping them on the line. </em></p>
<p><em>“But crucially, Daisy is also a reminder that no matter how persuasive someone on the other end of the phone may be, they aren’t always who you think they are. With scammers operating fulltime call centres specifically to target Brits, we’re urging everyone to remain vigilant and help play their part in stopping fraud by forwarding on dodgy calls and texts to 7726 for free.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Swerve the Scammers </strong></p>
<p>O2 has invested heavily in the fight against fraud, rolling out AI-powered spam fighting tools and new caller identification services free to all mobile customers to help protect them. The operator also blocks millions of fraudulent texts and calls from reaching customers phones every month.</p>
<p>However, with scammers constantly evolving their processes and using increasingly sophisticated methods, the business is encouraging Brits to leave scambaiting to the AI experts. Instead, the public can help block scammers by forwarding suspected scam calls and text messages to <em>7726</em>.</p>
<p>By reporting dodgy calls and messages, the telecoms company is able to investigate and block the mobile numbers used by fraudsters and can also use scam texts to help refine its blocking services, making it easier to identify and stop new trends faster in future. Last year alone, Virgin Media O2 blocked 89 million texts, in part thanks to 7726.</p>
<p>To help make life easier for customers, O2 has pulled together a new webpage offering tips, tricks and advice so they know what to look out for. <a href="https://news.virginmediao2.co.uk/fraud/">Head to our Swerve the Scammers page for more information.</a></p>
<p><strong>Virgin Media O2 is calling for wider action to prevent fraud</strong></p>
<p>The company recently exposed the scale of the UK’s fraud problem after finding that nearly seven in ten Brits (69%)<sup>1</sup> reported that they’ve been targeted by scammers. Last year alone, Virgin Media O2 intercepted and blocked over £250 million in suspected fraudulent transactions — equivalent to stopping one every two minutes.</p>
<p>Warning that not enough is being done to protect consumers, Virgin Media O2 is calling on the government to take accountability for stopping fraud at its source by appointing a dedicated fraud minister and creating a single centralised, specialised and properly resourced national policing body responsible for investigating all instances of fraud.</p>
<p><u>Notes to Eds</u></p>
<p><strong>About Daisy</strong></p>
<p>Daisy is a human-like AI that has been developed to hold autonomous conversations with scam callers and keep them on the line for as long as possible. The custom-built AI scambaiter has been answering calls from scammers and having lifelike but meandering conversations with no input required from her creators.</p>
<p>Daisy combines various AI models which work together to first listen to the caller and transcribe their voice into text. Appropriate responses are then generated through a custom large language model complete with a character ‘personality’ layer, and then fed back through a custom AI text-to-speech model to generate a voice answer. This takes place in real time, allowing the tool to hold a human-like conversation with a caller.</p>
<p><strong>O2’s top tips to stay safe from fraudsters</strong></p>
<p>O2 has pulled together three simple steps on what to do when called by a scammer or upon receiving a suspicious message:</p>
<p><strong>STOP:</strong>&nbsp;If&nbsp;you receive a call out of the blue for someone claiming to be from O2, think about what you’re being asked to do. Does it feel right? Are you being asked for personal data or a code over the phone? If you have any suspicion that you might be speaking to a scammer, the best thing to do is hang up and call us back by dialling 202 from your O2 phone.</p>
<p><strong>SEND to 7726:&nbsp;</strong>Worked out you might have spoken to or received a text from a scammer? Don’t just ignore it, take a few seconds to forward on to&nbsp;<strong>7726</strong>. It spells SPAM on your phone’s keypad and is the free number to use to report to us so we can investigate. It helps keep you safe and allows us to block fraudsters numbers and prevent or shut down similar scams faster in future.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAK OUT:</strong>&nbsp;Let your friends and family know about the scam. By telling others, you can help keep them safe and ensure they’re never caught off guard.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>My own answer, about the name of the letter $\wp$. Mostly in <em>computing</em>, with little math. (Lengthy)</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>In computing, the letter $\wp$ has been plagued with a plethora of inappropriate names. I guess "Weierstrass p" is one of such  names that some standard created, and has been copied without much scrutiny. I suspect that ISO-8879 in 1986 was the root of all evil.</p>

<p>Names and references that survive in latest standards are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>\wp</code>: TeX</li>
<li><code>script capital p</code> (wrong) and <code>weierstrass elliptic function</code> (alias): Unicode</li>
<li><code>&amp;weierp;</code>: HTML (and XML?)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Unicode</h2>

<p>Unicode is not directly related to my question, but it is important behind the scenes, so a good point to start.</p>

<h3>Basics</h3>

<p>In Unicode the letter $\wp$ is given the codepoint U+2118 in the block "letterlike symbols", named "script capital p". But in fact it's lowercase. There's also an official alias "weierstrass elliptic function".</p>

<p><a href="http://www.unicode.org/notes/tn27/" rel="noreferrer">Unicode Technical Note #27</a> regrets this misnomer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Should have been called <em>calligraphic small p</em> or <em>Weierstrass elliptic function symbol</em>, which is what it is used for. It is not a capital "P" at all. A formal alias correcting this to WEIERSTRASS ELLIPTIC FUNCTION has been defined.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.unicode.org/notes/tn27/tn27-1.html" rel="noreferrer">The first version</a> of Technical Note #27 in 2006 was a bit more emphatic</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Should have been called <em>calligraphic small p</em> or <strong>perhaps even</strong> <em>Weierstrass elliptic function symbol</em>, which is what it is used for. It's not a capital "P" at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Boldification is done by me.)</p>

<h3>Unicode 1.0 (1991)</h3>

<p>Unicode 1.0 (1991) defined the letter, and the <a href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/reconstructed/1.0.0/UnicodeData.txt" rel="noreferrer">name was</a> "script p". It was also called "weierstrass elliptic function". (See Footnote)</p>

<h3>Unicode 2 (1996) screwed it up</h3>

<p>They gave wrong names. <em>As seen later, this change matters for us.</em> From the file <a href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/2.0-Update/NamesList-1.txt" rel="noreferrer">Nameslist</a>:</p>

<pre><code>2118  SCRIPT CAPITAL P
      = per
      = power set
      = Weierstrass elliptic function
</code></pre>

<p>(All of them were legitimate names. See also the file <a href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/2.0-Update/Index-1.txt" rel="noreferrer">index</a>.) <br>
Alas, power set; $\wp$ is <em>lowercase</em>. (But what's "per"? According to Wiktionary's entry "<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/per#Synonyms" rel="noreferrer">per</a>" the preposition "per" used to be written sometimes with a script letter "p". An example can be found in 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica. See <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Abbreviation#per" rel="noreferrer">Wikisource</a> or <a href="https://archive.org/stream/EncyclopaediaBritannicaDict.a.s.l.g.i.11thed.chisholm.1910-1911-1922.33vols/01.EncycBrit.11th.1910.v.1.A-AND.#page/n66/mode/1up" rel="noreferrer">archive.org</a>)</p>

<p>Teminology note: The file "NamesList" maps from the codepoint (letter itself) to their names, the main one and aliases, if any. "Index" is the inverse mapping.</p>

<p>(Paranoiac detail: In Unicode 2.1, they changed its writing direction from "Other neutral" to "Left-to-right" See <a href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/2.1-Update2/diff212v214.txt" rel="noreferrer">here</a>. For writing directionos see <a href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/2.1-Update2/diff212v214.txt." rel="noreferrer">this</a>.</p>

<h3>Unicode 3.0 (1999)</h3>

<p>In 3.0, two wrong names "per" and "power set" can't be seen in <a href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/3.0-Update/NamesList-3.0.0.txt" rel="noreferrer">Nameslist</a>, but they still exist in <a href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/3.0-Update/Index-3.0.0.txt" rel="noreferrer">Index</a>. Wow. They still remained in <a href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/3.2-Update/" rel="noreferrer">3.2 Index</a></p>

<p>But not sure if this removal was officially announced</p>

<p>Unicode never changes the main names once they are given, so "script capital p" will stay for ever.</p>

<h3>Unicode 4.0 (2003)</h3>

<p>In Unicode <a href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/4.0-Update/" rel="noreferrer">4.0</a>, it seems the index file was abolished. So it's finally settled to be "script capital p" and "weierstrass elliptic function".</p>

<h3>Unicode 6.1 (2012)</h3>

<p>Finally in Unicode <a href="http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.1.0/" rel="noreferrer">6.1</a>, the meaning of aliases were clarified. "weierstrass elliptic function" of U+2118 was <a href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/6.1.0/ucd/NameAliases.txt" rel="noreferrer">defined</a> to be "correction".</p>

<h2>Knuth's book (1986)</h2>

<p><em>Computer Modern Typeface</em> <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=CwdUAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=weierstrass+isbn:0201134462&amp;dq=weierstrass+isbn:0201134462&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;" rel="noreferrer">(google books link)</a> by Don Knuth was published in 1986.</p>

<p>In p 26, there's a line <em>there are special symbols like Weierstrass's ‘p’ (℘)</em>. However, in the index in p 580, there's only the entry "Weierstrass, Karl Theodor Wilhelm", pointing to pp 26, 233 and 235, and the entry "Weierstrass'p" is not there. So I guess Knuth did <strong>not</strong> mean that "Weierstrass'p" was the name of the symbol.</p>

<h2>Old ISO, MathML, XML... true culprit?</h2>

<p>Section summary: "Weierstrass p" was introduced sometime, but not sure exactly when. It has becoming obsolete, but not completely yet.</p>

<p>In HTML, you can write $\wp$ by escaping as <code>&amp;weierp;</code>. Dunno other markup languages.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-MathML/toc.html" rel="noreferrer">MathML 1.01 specification</a> (1998), $\wp$ is given the name "weierp", of which description is <strong>"Weierstrass p"</strong> and the alias "wp". <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-MathML/chap6/ISOAMSOe1.html" rel="noreferrer">See here</a>. The letter derived from "ISOamso", but I can't be sure if the name came from ISOamso, too. The status of the latest MathML, 3.0, will be stated at the end of this section.</p>

<p>ISOamso ("Added Math Symbols: Ordinary", has nothing to do with AMS :)
is a part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8879" rel="noreferrer">SGML = ISO 8879:1986</a> in 1986, according to <a href="https://www.w3.org/2003/entities/2007/isoamso.ent" rel="noreferrer">this</a>.
When the first MathML was under construction, ISO 10646 (roughly speaking Unicode itself, but its counterpart in ISO) were apparently not there. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-MathML/chapter6.html#sec6.2.2" rel="noreferrer">See this</a>. They had to gather letters from various standards.</p>

<p>HTML is worse: I couldn't find any entity specification about $\wp$ in HTML 1 - 3. (In very rough translation, entity = letter. See <a href="http://www.landofcode.com/html-tutorials/html-entities.php" rel="noreferrer">this intro</a>) In HTML4 (1999), it is <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html4/sgml/entities.html#h-24.3" rel="noreferrer">defined as</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;!ENTITY weierp   CDATA "&amp;#8472;" -- script capital P = power set = Weierstrass p, U+2118 ISOamso --&gt;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because HTML4 has been used so long (it's still in use), this wrong sepcification has spreaded widely. See below.</p>

<p>In HTML5 (2014), the word "entity" was abolished. "Character entity references" was change to "Character references", and the term "Named entities" was replaced with "Named character references". <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5-pubnotes/" rel="noreferrer">See this</a>. "Weierp" seems to have lost peculiarity up to HTML4; it's simply U+2118, and that's all. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#character-references" rel="noreferrer">See this</a> (Work on HTML5 started back in 2004, but it took long time until final publication.)</p>

<p>There's also "XML entity definitions". Although XML is rather old, the official  specification of entities seems to have had been lacking for long.
In its latest version <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-xml-entity-names-20140410/" rel="noreferrer">(2nd ed)</a> in 2014, $\wp$ is <a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/entities/2007/htmlmathml-f.ent" rel="noreferrer">nothing but "weierp"</a>. See <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-xml-entity-names-20140410/#sets" rel="noreferrer">chap 2</a>. ISOamso is now <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-xml-entity-names-20140410/#legacysets" rel="noreferrer">one of legacy entity sets</a>.  In its <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2010/REC-xml-entity-names-20100401/" rel="noreferrer">first version</a> in 2010 however, it's classified as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2010/REC-xml-entity-names-20100401/isoamso.html" rel="noreferrer">ISOamso</a></p>

<p>Anyway in ISOamso pages (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-xml-entity-names-20140410/isoamso.html" rel="noreferrer">ver 2</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2010/REC-xml-entity-names-20100401/isoamso.html" rel="noreferrer">ver 1</a>) its description is "/wp - Weierstrass p", with the alias "wp". It seems the slash in "/wp" corresponds to LaTex <em>backslash</em>. (Cf. /hbar, /ell, /Re etc)</p>

<p>Unfortunately in MathML 3.0, (the latest, released in 2010) it still depends on XML's "legacy" entity sets, and it <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2010/REC-MathML3-20101021/chapter7.html" rel="noreferrer">refers to</a> ISOamso. "Weierstrass'p" is not yet dead.</p>

<h2>"Weierstrass-p" spreaded</h2>

<p>The word "Weierstrass p" appears in e.g. <a href="https://www.google.co.jp/search?tbm=bks&amp;hl=ja&amp;q=isbn%3A9780895886286+%22Weierstrass+p%22" rel="noreferrer">Encyclopedia Machintosh</a> (1990), <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=nIVVAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22weierstrass+p%22+letter&amp;dq=%22weierstrass+p%22+letter&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiexquyr7rVAhXI7hoKHbBWCH04HhDoAQglMAA" rel="noreferrer">MacUser magazine</a> (1992)</p>

There had not been any to mean the symbol $\wp$. The result of dropping "'s" is similar. Date limitation in Google search is not so reliable thus it does not prove anything.</p>

Microsoft's document <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/aa212305(v=office.11).aspx" rel="noreferrer">HTML Character sets</a> reads "Office 2003", although its exact date and scope are not clear.

<h2>Footnote</h2>

<p>In Unicode 1.0.0 (1991), it was <strong>NOT</strong> "script capital p", the current name. In <a href="http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode1.0.0/Index1.pdf" rel="noreferrer">Unicode Name Index</a> (pdf), names  "script p" and "weierstrass elliptic function"  are found. See pdf pages 22 and 27. This did not change in Unicode 1.0.1 (1992).<br>
Unicode 1.0 implicitly, but clearly meant it was capital. All lowercase letters were named "small".</p>

<p>It seems that in Unicode 1.1 (1993) the name was changed to "script <em>capital</em> p" See <a href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/1.1-Update/UnicodeData-1.1.5.txt" rel="noreferrer">UnicodeData-1.1.5</a></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-w-id="5b8e0128-dfc2-fd07-77df-30819f5d5004"><p>There is an emerging belief that AI will make tech debt <strong>less relevant</strong>. Since it’s getting easier to write code, and easier to clean up code, wouldn’t it make sense that the typical company can handle a little more debt?</p><p>The opposite is true - AI has significantly increased the real cost of carrying tech debt. The key impact to notice is that generative AI <strong>dramatically widens the gap in velocity </strong>between ‘low-debt’ coding and ‘high-debt’ coding.</p><p>Companies with relatively young, high-quality codebases benefit the most from generative AI tools, while companies with gnarly, legacy codebases will struggle to adopt them. In other words, the penalty for having a ‘high-debt’ codebase is now larger than ever.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/665a5f120c4c63df1944d627/673529427e9a3f24440903f2_673529288758869858b0a9d2_Screenshot%2520from%25202024-11-13%252014-32-42.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Model of AI&nbsp;Tools' Impact; Large Velocity Gain on Low-Debt Code</figcaption></figure><h3>GenAI can’t handle High Complexity</h3><p>If you’ve tried tools like <a href="https://cursor.com/">Cursor</a> or <a href="https://aider.chat/">Aider</a> for professional coding, you know that their performance is highly sensitive to the complexity of the code you’re working on. They provide a dramatic speedup when applying pre-existing patterns, and when making use of existing interfaces or module relationships. However, in ‘high-debt’ environments with subtle control flow, long-range dependencies, and unexpected patterns, they struggle to generate a useful response.</p><p>Not only does a complex codebase make it harder for the model to generate a coherent response, it also makes it harder for the developer to formulate a coherent request.</p><p>This experience has lead most developers to “watch and wait” for the tools to improve until they can handle ‘production-level’ complexity in software. While genAI is improving dramatically in some sense (multi-modal, faster, smaller, cheaper), this barrier has so far proven more stubborn, with o1 seeing relatively low adoption and multi-agent frameworks failing to significantly scale reasoning capabilities.</p><h3>Make Your Tools Work for You</h3><p>Instead of trying to force genAI tools to tackle thorny issues in legacy codebases, human experts should do the work of refactoring legacy code until genAI can operate on it smoothly. When direct refactoring is still too risky, teams can adjust their development strategy with approaches like <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/StranglerFigApplication.html">strangler fig</a> to build greenfield modules which can benefit immediately from genAI tooling.</p><p>This implies a shift to a higher level of abstraction for a modern development team. A product should be owned by a lean team of experts, focused primarily on the architecture of their code rather than the implementation details.</p><h3>AI-Friendly Approaches</h3><p>In essence, the goal should be to unblock your AI tools as much as possible. One reliable way to do this is to spend time breaking your system down into cohesive and coherent modules, each interacting through an explicit interface.</p><p>A useful heuristic for evaluating a set of modules is to use them to explain your core features and data flows in natural language. You should be able to concisely describe current and planned functionality. You might also want to set up <a href="https://github.com/gauge-sh/tach">visibility and enforcement</a> to make progress toward your desired architecture.</p><p>A modern development team should work to maintain and evolve a system of well-defined modules which robustly model the needs of their domain. Day-to-day feature work should then be done on top of this foundation with maximum leverage from generative AI tooling.</p><p>‍</p><h3>Quality Leads to Speed</h3><p>It’s now more valuable than ever to have a high-quality codebase. Investment into modular architecture lets teams take full advantage of generative AI tools, achieving rapid feature development while simultaneously building higher quality software.</p></div></div>]]></description>

The legal system is the essential bedrock upon which all else in society is built. The protection of civil rights, peaceful conflict resolution, access to due process, enforceable contracts — all these depend on a well functioning legal system.</p><p>The professionals who operate this system are equipped with inadequate tooling. Absent git-like version control, they rely on inefficient and error-prone manual “version control” processing.</p><p><span>In many cases, manual version control processes (e.g. git diff, merge, and rebase but by hand) take</span><strong> more than an hour of lawyer time per contract version while resulting in errors!</strong></p><p>Note: this problem is not specific to the law. Finance professionals, academic researchers, legislators, among many other professionals encounter similar version control issues. We are currently focused on law because of our domain expertise and because the problem is particularly pronounced in the law.</p><p>As many have observed, lawyers face the same fundamental set of problems that coders do when collaborating. They have multiple collaborators contributing changes to a project concurrently. They need to receive approval from their colleagues prior to committing their changes. When a colleague commits new changes, they must update their current work to account for them.</p><p>Absent a concurrent version control system like git, lawyers rely on a process called "redlining" to solve these problems. A "redline" is the equivalent of a diff in git.

This is challenging because different lawyers maintain different conventions for version naming. Actual matters often have 10x+ as many versions as this.</figcaption></figure></div><p>The above process has several issues — the most obvious of which is that it's tremendously inefficient. It can take an associate lawyer several hours to integrate changes of a 100+ page contract such as a stock purchase agreement. Equally important, however, is that it’s error prone. If two specialists introduce conflicting changes, there is no way for the specialist to know without manually reading the redlines side-by-side. It's a huge problem if an associate incorrectly reconciles a merge conflict, &nbsp;especially if they overwrite the changes made by a more senior colleague since those changes could become permanent legal obligations worth millions of dollars.</p><p>As any coder knows, git is designed to solve exactly the sorts of problems that the lawyer is tasked with above. When I tell coders about Version Story, they often ask me, "why don't lawyers just use git?"</p><p>While git is an excellent tool for coding, there are two reasons why it will never see adoption amongst legal professionals.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Docx</strong><span>. Every lawyer uses Microsoft Word. They're trained with it early in their career and regularly take advantage of idiosyncratic formatting features. Every legal contract and precedent created in the past 25 years currently is in docx (or its predecessor doc). The information underpinning the entire US legal system (and every other legal system) is in docx. Docx is as much the standard for legal drafting as JavaScript is for client-side web programming.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95bf99da-6f08-46c5-9e9c-28fdb75cd15c_587x112.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95bf99da-6f08-46c5-9e9c-28fdb75cd15c_587x112.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95bf99da-6f08-46c5-9e9c-28fdb75cd15c_587x112.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95bf99da-6f08-46c5-9e9c-28fdb75cd15c_587x112.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95bf99da-6f08-46c5-9e9c-28fdb75cd15c_587x112.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95bf99da-6f08-46c5-9e9c-28fdb75cd15c_587x112.png" width="696" height="132.79727427597956" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/95bf99da-6f08-46c5-9e9c-28fdb75cd15c_587x112.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:112,&quot;width&quot;:587,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:696,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95bf99da-6f08-46c5-9e9c-28fdb75cd15c_587x112.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95bf99da-6f08-46c5-9e9c-28fdb75cd15c_587x112.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95bf99da-6f08-46c5-9e9c-28fdb75cd15c_587x112.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95bf99da-6f08-46c5-9e9c-28fdb75cd15c_587x112.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Good luck making this happen</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>Git works with plain text files, not docx files.

The set of people capable of solving it is limited to those who have both worked professionally as lawyers and also are proficient coders.</p><p>My co-founder Kevin is such a person. Prior to founding Version Story, he worked both as an M&amp;A lawyer at Simpson Thacher and as a software engineer at LinkedIn. I can confidently say I would not be able to build a product fit to the needs of lawyers without his first-hand experience guiding our design.</p><p>Over the years, several startups have attempted to solve this problem. None of them have had domain experience in the legal field. Because of that, they are unaware of the two constraints necessary to break into legal workflows — docx and UX. To sidestep the immense technical challenges of handling docx, they build in-browser text editors thinking they can get lawyers to draft in their application instead of in Microsoft Word. In their UX, they use terminology like “pull”, “push”, “rebase”,&nbsp; and “HEAD” forgetting how inscrutable this terminology is to the uninitiated.</p><p>Any product that seeks to bring the functionality of git to a mass audience must handle docx and mustn’t be afraid to rethink the user experience from the ground up.</p><p><span>Building a solution to this problem was hard. The technical problems of comparing and rendering docx files and the UX problem of making git-like functionality intuitive required a substantial amount of creativity, determination, and patience on both parts. Beyond that, establishing credibility in the legal industry such that top law firms could entrust us with their confidential documents presented its own set of challenges. Thankfully we had the </span><a href="https://paulgraham.com/schlep.html" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">benefit of ignorance prior to embarking on these schleps</a><span>.</span></p><p>When we started Version Story, we intended to leverage third party APIs for our document processing while focusing our energy on solving the UX challenges of reimagining git. Docx has been the standard file format for word processing since 2007 — surely there should be reliable APIs for comparing them and converting them to html and pdf.</p><p><span>We were wrong and, believe me, we tried not to be. While APIs exist which purport to do what we need them to, they are nowhere near adequate for legal use cases. They would work fine in demos with simple test documents, but as soon as an actual lawyer attempted to compare a 500+ page prospectus with complex tables, custom formatting, and embedded images, they would fail. </span><strong>Not even Microsoft Word's internal compare tool is adequate for such cases.</strong><span> We had to build our own custom comparison engine.</span></p><p><span>Comparing plain text is a solved problem. Since 1986, Myers Diff has been the standard algorithm for text comparison. There are plenty of</span><a href="https://blog.jcoglan.com/2017/02/12/the-myers-diff-algorithm-part-1" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"> helpful online resources</a><span> for learning the algorithm.</span></p><p>Comparing documents is not a solved problem. Docx is an open file format which implements the OpenXml specification of XML. Under the hood, a docx file is a zipped set of XML documents. OpenXML is similar enough to html to be legible to those who have written html but with far fewer SDKs for interfacing with it. If you imagine how you would represent things like formatting, tables, links, etc. with HTML, that's essentially how it's represented in OpenXML.</p><p>A document comparison system requires,</p><ul><li><p>Decomposing the document into well-designed data structures.</p></li><li><p>Comparing text that can be arbitrarily nested in any set of different containers such as tables, text boxes, and shapes.</p></li><li><p><span>Defining an </span><a href="https://www.wilfred.me.uk/blog/2022/09/06/difftastic-the-fantastic-diff/#:~:text=Diff%20algorithms%20are%20described%20in,file%20into%20the%20output%20file." rel="nofollow ugc noopener">edit script</a><span> format that can express both textual changes and structural changes (modifying formatting, changing table dimensions, etc).&nbsp;</span></p></li><li><p>Using that edit script to rebuild the document while pulling in the correct formatting from both the original and modified documents.</p></li></ul><p>Additionally, several elements of this system required novel algorithm designs. Unlike comparing plain text, there is no standard algorithm for comparing tables. How do we know which rows from the original document match with which rows of the modified? The same goes for columns. Furthermore, how can we determine if a row or column has been modified or if it's been wholly inserted or deleted? How do we know if we're even comparing the correct tables against each other in the first place?</p><p>Beyond the elegant world of theory and algorithms, we had to work through the long tail of edge cases. Docx is an enormous file standard with countless features you’ve never heard of. After building the initial version of our system, it took debugging hundreds of edge cases to get it to a point where it’s consistently reliable. Since the files we compare are generated outside of our system, it was impossible to anticipate all of the edge cases in advance. The only way to do so is to work through them when they arise in production.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F418f2320-b211-4a46-b7b2-3498da663572_604x318.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F418f2320-b211-4a46-b7b2-3498da663572_604x318.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F418f2320-b211-4a46-b7b2-3498da663572_604x318.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F418f2320-b211-4a46-b7b2-3498da663572_604x318.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F418f2320-b211-4a46-b7b2-3498da663572_604x318.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F418f2320-b211-4a46-b7b2-3498da663572_604x318.png" width="604" height="318" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/418f2320-b211-4a46-b7b2-3498da663572_604x318.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:318,&quot;width&quot;:604,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:50229,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F418f2320-b211-4a46-b7b2-3498da663572_604x318.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F418f2320-b211-4a46-b7b2-3498da663572_604x318.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F418f2320-b211-4a46-b7b2-3498da663572_604x318.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F418f2320-b211-4a46-b7b2-3498da663572_604x318.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Once again, good luck to anyone who tries this.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Finally, supporting such a system presents some thorny system-level problems.

aren't just text on a page – they're the operating system of society. When lawyers draft and revise contracts, regulations, and legislation, they're writing the rules that govern how our world works. The stakes couldn't be higher:</p><ul><li><p>A missed change in a merger agreement could cost clients millions of dollars</p></li><li><p>An overlooked revision in a regulatory filing could expose companies to legal liability</p></li><li><p>Conflicting changes in contract terms could lead to years of litigation</p></li><li><p>The inability to trace how legal language evolved can hamper future interpretation</p></li></ul><p><span>In a 2022 article of</span><a href="https://newsletterhunt.com/emails/40489" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"> Money Stuff titled “Brightline redline”</a><span>, Matt Levine illustrates an example of these stakes, describing how Certares and Knighthead found themselves in litigation with Morgan Stanley and Brightline over a $25,000,000 credit agreement where the two sides couldn't even agree on which version was signed. "If there is a dispute about what the contract says," Levine explains, "you have to go back through the email chain to pick out which attachment everyone thought they were signing off on." The dispute centered on critical language about loan prepayments worth millions of dollars – language that one side claims was never agreed to.</span></p><p>The next generation of legal collaboration will not be plagued by issues like these. It will be faster, better, safer, and easier with a concurrent version control system like Version Story.</p><p>We've kept our heads down the past four years relentlessly building a solution to this problem and credibility in the legal industry. We now have a differentiated product that users love and sell to top legal teams like those of Dentons, Addleshaw Goddard, Mishcon de Reya, Barings, and Pantera Capital.</p><p>Over the coming months, we will launch to the public.

The tools have gotten good enough that if you can handle an IDE and push some YAML to git, you're already qualified.</span></p><div id="youtube2-XR2DicY1zEM" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;XR2DicY1zEM&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XR2DicY1zEM?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><p>Having lived through the evolution from DevOps (ClusterHQ) to MLOps (Dotscience) and now diving deep into GenAI with HelixML, I keep seeing the same pattern: complex tools get simpler, workflows get standardized, and suddenly what seemed like rocket science becomes just... more engineering.</p><p>Building an AI application comes down to six building blocks:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Models</strong><span>: Just mathematical functions. Complex ones, sure, but at their core, they're just turning words into numbers and back again.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Prompts</strong><span>: Telling the model what to do in plain English. Sometimes you need to be really explicit - like talking to a toddler.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Knowledge</strong><span>: Your AI's personal knowledge base. Documents, websites, whatever you need it to learn from.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Integrations</strong><span>: This is where it gets interesting - connecting your AI to real business systems through APIs.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Tests</strong><span>: Because nobody wants their AI going sideways in production. Yes, you can test AI apps, and you absolutely should.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Deployment</strong><span>: Running it on a server. For example, versioning the entire app above in a yaml file and </span><a href="https://blog.helix.ml/p/announcing-helix-14-cicd-for-cloud" rel="">using Flux to manage deployment to K8s and Helix</a><span>.</span></p></li></ol><p>Here's where my DevOps background kicks in. You know all those tools you're already using? Git? CI/CD pipelines? They work for AI apps too. I demonstrated this live in the talk by building a Jira integration that could write code based on ticket descriptions.</p><p><span>The secret sauce? Something we're calling an "</span><a href="https://aispec.org/" rel="">AISpec</a><span>" - a YAML file that pulls all these pieces together in a way that feels natural to anyone who's worked with modern infrastructure tools.</span></p><p>This bit's important: when you use open source models, your data stays yours. It doesn't end up training someone else's model. For companies worried about GDPR or other national, regional or corporate regulation, this is crucial. You can run everything locally, in your own infrastructure, with your data staying right where your legal team wants it.</p><p><span>If you're reading this thinking "show me the code," I've got you covered. Here’s a complete reference architecture you can set up to do this stuff yourself: </span><strong><a href="https://github.com/helixml/genai-cicd-ref" rel="">https://github.com/helixml/genai-cicd-ref</a></strong></p><p>And here’s a complete tutorial of using and setting up the reference architecture:</p><div id="youtube2-noilYeBqNUA" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;noilYeBqNUA&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/noilYeBqNUA?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><p>The main thing I want you to take away is this: if you can handle version control and basic deployment workflows, you can build production-ready AI applications. The tools are there. The models are there. And they're getting better every day.</p><p><span>Check out </span><a href="https://aispec.org/" rel="">aispec.org</a><span> if you want to dig into the standard format we're proposing for all this. Or if you want to chat about any of this, </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/luke-marsden-71b3789/" rel="">find me on LinkedIn</a><span> or drop me an email at </span><a href="mailto:luke@helix.ml" rel="">luke@helix.ml</a><span>.</span></p><p>This is about making AI engineering accessible to everyone who knows how to ship code. No PhD required, no magic - just solid engineering practices applied to these powerful new tools.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Onion, the satirical news company that repeatedly spoofed conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, has won the<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/future-alex-jones-infowars-hands-bidders-bankruptcy-auction-rcna179563" target="_blank"> bankruptcy auction</a> for control over his media empire — most notably InfoWars, the far-right, conspiracy-minded website that served as Jones’ primary online platform.</p><p>Jones<a href="https://x.com/realalexjones/status/1857058831135645739" target="_blank"> announced the sale on X</a> Thursday morning.</p><p>“I just got word 15 minutes ago that my lawyers and folks met with the U.S. trustee over our bankruptcy this morning and they said they are shutting us down even without a court order this morning,” Jones said.</p><p>“I don’t know what’s going to happen but I’m going to be here until they come and turn the lights off,” he added.</p><p>The Onion plans to shutter Jones’ InfoWars and rebuild the website featuring well-known internet humor writers and content creators, according to a person with knowledge of the sale.</p><p>Jones, 50, one of the most-high profile and financially successful alternative media personalities, built a small empire off a radio show-turned-internet video operation centered around the Infowars brand that focused on false and often bizarre claims about grand conspiracies and government wrongdoing.</p><p>Details of Wednesday’s auction, including how much was offered for Free Speech Systems, the parent company of Infowars, and related assets, were not immediately known. Funds generated from the sale are meant to satisfy Jones’ estate creditors, comprised largely of victims’ families of the<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/sandy-hook-shooting-survivors-graduate-high-school-reflect-1st-grade-m-rcna156740" target="_blank"> 2012 Sandy Hook shooting</a> to whom he must pay damages in defamation verdicts.</p><p>Sandy Hook families filed lawsuits in Connecticut and Texas claiming Jones defamed them on his show and inflicted emotional distress by repeatedly suggesting the shooting, in which a gunman <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/sandy-hook-shooting-survivors-graduate-high-school-reflect-1st-grade-m-rcna156740" target="_blank">killed 20 first-grade children and six adults</a>, was a hoax.</p><p>Juries found Jones liable for defamation and awarded the families nearly $1.5 billion in total in their lawsuits, but they have been unable to collect anything from Jones, who claimed he can’t afford that massive a sum. He<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/infowars-host-alex-jones-files-bankruptcy-court-records-show-rcna59793" target="_blank"> filed for bankruptcy</a> in late 2022, and a judge in June<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/sandy-hook-families-accuse-alex-jones-erratic-behavior-ahead-bankruptc-rcna157017" target="_blank"> allowed him to liquidate his personal assets</a> to help pay off the verdicts.</p><p>The sale had the backing of several of the Connecticut families of Sandy Hook shooting who were part of the lawsuit.</p><p>“Our clients knew that true accountability meant an end to Infowars and an end to Jones’ ability to spread lies, pain and fear at scale,” Chris Mattei, attorney for the Connecticut families said in a statement. “By divesting Jones of Infowars’ assets, the families and the team at The Onion have done a public service and will meaningfully hinder Jones’ ability to do more harm.”</p><p>The anti-violence organization Everytown for Gun Safety said it will be the exclusive advertiser in The Onion’s new venture as part of a multiyear agreement.</p><p>John Feinblatt, the group’s president, said in a statement that he hopes to “reach new audiences ready to hold the gun industry accountable for contributing to our nation’s gun violence epidemic.”</p><p>Since April, The Onion has been led by chief executive Ben Collins, who previously covered disinformation and conspiracy theories for NBC News, a beat that often meant covering Jones. Collins has introduced several changes meant to monetize the business, including subscriptions, organized live events, and bringing back physical copies of the paper and its television parody, The Onion News Network.</p><p>In June, Collins answered calls from followers online that The Onion purchase InfoWars with <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bencollins.bsky.social/post/3kuclxsix6c24" target="_blank">a meme</a> “looking into it.”</p><p>Those interested in acquiring Jones’ media company had submitted their final offers to federal court-appointed trustee Christopher Murray, who was tasked with picking a best bid, but not necessarily the highest.</p><p>The identities of potential buyers were secret as they had to agree to nondisclosure agreements in order to receive bid materials.</p><p>The auction firms running the sale said that there are “no restrictions on the use of any acquired property in the bankruptcy order,” and that the winner has the choice of whether or not to continue Infowars’ operations.</p><p>On his show this week, amid pleas for listeners to buy subscriptions and the nutritional supplements he sells, Jones painted a picture of his potential buyers, describing one group of anonymous bidders as friendly backers who would allow his show to operate as normal. Others, he said, were “bad guys” who would shut InfoWars down.</p><p>While he said he would continue to broadcast via an alternative channel if ordered to shutter by a new buyer, Jones noted he would be hampered by the loss of his brand, website and equipment, among other necessities.</p><p>“All you leftists celebrating the end of Alex Jones and Infowars, you’re fools,” he said. “Just watch.”</p><p>Up for grabs at the auction were InfoWars production rights and materials, the InfoWars store, domain names, production equipment and other assets — including a Terradyne armored truck and a Winnebago motorhome — that can be purchased in their entirety or in parts, according to the firm, ThreeSixty Asset Advisors. Jones broadcasts from the Austin, Texas, area.</p><p>The auction is part of Murray’s “<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/bankruptcy-court-trustee-alex-jones-liquidation-case-previews-wind-med-rcna158659" target="_blank">orderly wind-down process</a>“ under the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, which has overseen the latest phase of the case against Jones, stemming from the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in Newtown, Connecticut.</p><p>In fitting form for the satirical website, the Onion’s press release announcing the sale was written in the voice of a CEO of Global Tetrahedron, a fictional evil company created by Onion staff. Former tech executive Jeff Lawson took on the name Global Tetrahedron for his real company that acquired the Onion from G/O Media in April.&nbsp;</p><p>“Through it all, InfoWars has shown an unswerving commitment to manufacturing anger and radicalizing the most vulnerable members of society—values that resonate deeply with all of us at Global Tetrahedron,” the release said.</p><p>Jones founded Infowars, which operates under Free Speech Systems, in 1999. The company itself held about $6 million in cash and $1.2 million in inventory, according to previous court filings from June.</p><p>The families in Texas and Connecticut have<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/alex-jones-infowars-shutdown-looms-sandy-hook-families-seek-collect-co-rcna158891" target="_blank"> sparred in court</a> over the liquidation process, with concerns over how the money will be distributed. Still, they have said, Jones’ loss of his company brings some accountability for his past words.</p><p>At his trial in Texas in 2022, Jones generally blamed “corporate media” for twisting his words and misportraying him but didn’t specify how.</p><p>While Jones also testified that he believes Sandy Hook was “100% real,” he has used the ongoing litigation to galvanize his listeners as he faces the loss of InfoWars.</p></div><div><div data-activity-map="expanded-byline-article-bottom"><div data-testid="byline-thumbnail"><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/brandy-zadrozny-ncpn858391"><picture data-testid="picture"><source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/newscms/2020_09/3242336/brandy-zadrozny-circle-byline-template.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2020_09/3242336/brandy-zadrozny-circle-byline-template.jpg 1x"><img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2020_09/3242336/brandy-zadrozny-circle-byline-template.jpg" alt="" height="48" width="48"></picture></a></div><p><span data-testid="byline-name"><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/brandy-zadrozny-ncpn858391">Brandy Zadrozny</a></span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/brandyzadrozny" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span></span></a><a href="mailto:brandy.zadrozny@nbcuni.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span></span></a></span></p><p>Brandy Zadrozny is a senior reporter for NBC News.

<section>
<p>Is it normal for the Little Snitch Network Extension to consume Gigabytes of memory? No it isn’t.</p>
<p>Unfortunately that’s <a href="https://obdev.at/blog/apples-built-in-macos-firewall-breaks-third-party-firewalls/">another</a> new bug in the Network Extension framework of macOS. It’s a memory leak in Apple’s framework, which developers must use to create a firewall for the Mac. This bug first occurred in macOS 15.0 Sequoia.</p>
<p>You can easily check if you are affected by this bug by running the <code>leaks</code> command in a Terminal window:</p>
<pre><code>sudo leaks at.obdev.littlesnitch.networkextension | grep "total leaked bytes"</code></pre>
<p>On macOS 14 Sonoma you may get a hand full of leaks with a total of a few Kilobytes. That’s OK (sort of). But on macOS 15 Sequoia this can easily grow to hundreds of Megabytes and more.</p>
<p>Once again, we rely on Apple to fix this issue in a macOS update.</p>
<p>This bug has already been reported to Apple (FB15552991), but if you are affected by this bug, feel free to send another report via Feedback Assistant (mentioning the existing report FB15552991). This might help Apple to find the cause of the issue and it increases the chance that Apple will prioritize the fix.</p>
<p>For the time being, if you encounter an unreasonably huge memory consumption, you may enforce a restart of the Network Extension. To do so, open the <em>Activity Monitor</em> app in <em>Applications &gt; Utilities</em>, search for the <code>at.obdev.littlesnitch.networkextension</code> process (make sure that <em>All Processes</em> is selected in the <em>View</em> menu) and click the Stop button in the toolbar to quit the process. The extension will then restart automatically.</p></section>

					<div>
						<p>Earlier this year, I was working with my colleague Ema on a <strong>source-assisted application and architecture assessment</strong> for a client who was using <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/">Keycloak</a> to implement <strong>single sign-on</strong> on their applications. The purpose of the assessment was not to audit Keycloak itself. However, being it at the core of the authentication system, we took a look at it.</p>
<p>Keycloak is described as a solution for <em>“Open Source Identity and Access Management. Add authentication to applications and secure services with minimum effort. No need to deal with storing users or authenticating users. Keycloak provides user federation, strong authentication, user management, fine-grained authorization, and more.”</em></p>
<p>The relationship between Keycloak and Red Hat is not entirely clear to me, but the former is definitely supported by the latter:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/getting-started-keycloak-single-sign-operator">https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/getting-started-keycloak-single-sign-operator</a></li>
<li><a href="https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-build-of-keycloak">https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-build-of-keycloak</a></li>
</ul>
<p>During our analysis we identified some security issues and, therefore, we looked into how to report them to the developers:</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://security.humanativaspa.it/sec/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Pasted-image-20240820165225.png" alt="Pasted image 20240820165225.png" width="1027" height="349"></p>
<p>Let’s see what vulnerabilities we have discovered and reported.</p>
<h3>OTP bypass</h3>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/index.html#step-up-flow">step-up-flow guide</a>, a mechanism is described for defining different levels of security depending on the level of authentication (LOA), allowing for applications to use a first level (only username + password) or a second level (username + password + OTP). An administrator who follows this guide is led to make the “step-up flow” the default flow for the “browser flow” so that it is used for all applications.</p>
<p>The security issue is caused by the fact that <strong>the default “account” and “account-console” applications are considered as LOA1, therefore access is possible with only a username and a password</strong>, also if all other applications require an OTP (LOA2). <strong>This allows an attacker to completely bypass the OTP request</strong> with only a username and a password, as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The attacker tries to access one of the applications configured to login with Keycloak in LOA2.</li>
<li>The application redirects to Keycloak for authentication.</li>
<li>The attacker provides the correct username and password. At this point, Keycloak requests the OTP.</li>
<li>The attacker does not provide the OTP and instead goes to <a href="https://keycloak_url/realms/myrealm/account">https://keycloak_url/realms/myrealm/account</a> (the URL of the “account” default application, which requires username and password). Here the attacker can add a new OTP method without even being asked for a currently configured OTP, even if it’s present.</li>
<li>At this point, the attacker can return to the application and will know both the credentials and the OTP, thus being able to access it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Essentially, <strong>it is possible to completely bypass the second factor of authentication with only a username and a password</strong>.</p>
<p>The communication timeline follows:</p>

21/04/2024 – Request of a follow-up.<br>
22/04/2024 – First response: <code>Apologies for the lack of communication on our side. The discussion moved internally to the Keycloak team as this might be a duplicate of a CVE that was already reported and a fix was implemented and released. You can now find it as CVE-2023-3597 (see https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/security/advisories/GHSA-4f53-xh3v-g8x4).</code></p>

<p><img decoding="async" src="https://security.humanativaspa.it/sec/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Pasted-image-20240820170144.png" alt="Pasted image 20240820170144.png"></p>
<h3>Multiple security issues in authentication and authorization</h3>
<p>Multiple issues have been identified regarding the authentication and authorization of certain endpoints in the Keycloak software.</p>
<p>It has been observed that <strong>certain functionalities within Keycloak, specifically the&nbsp;<em>/metrics</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>/health</em>&nbsp;endpoints, are accessible without proper authentication</strong>. Even though those endpoints do not provide sensitive information, it is preferable that they are accessible only to authenticated individuals with the correct privileges.</p>
<p>Additionally, <strong>users with low privileges could access administrative functionalities in the Keycloak admin interface</strong>. This issue presents a significant security risk as it allows unauthorized users to perform actions reserved for administrators, potentially leading to data breaches or system compromise. The affected endpoints are:</p>
<ul>
<li>/admin/realms/myrealm/client-registration-policy/providers</li>
<li>/admin/myrealm/console/whoami</li>
<li>/admin/realms/myrealm/testLDAPConnection</li>
</ul>
<p>In particular, the last functionality (<em>testLDAPConnection</em>), in the event that an AD authentication system has been configured, allows to modify application data,&nbsp;<strong>enabling the submission of an LDAP request (and consequently LDAP access credentials) to a malicious endpoint that can steal the credentials</strong>.</p>
<p>An attacker with access to a non-administrative user account can invoke the “<em>testLDAPConnection</em> functionality by modifying the <em>connectionUrl</em> parameter with an arbitrary value, and the LDAP credentials will be sent to the attacker-controller server. To successfully execute this attack, it’s also necessary to know the <em>componentId</em> related to the domain authentication, which is retrievable in the cookies <em>KEYCLOAK_SESSION</em>, <em>KEYCLOAK_SESSION_LEGACY</em>, and in the responses returned by the <em>/admin/myrealm/console/whoami</em> endpoint.</p>
<p>The communication timeline follows:</p>
<p>04/04/2024 – First communication sent with all details.<br>
09/04/2024 – Response with request of clarifications.<br>
09/04/2024 – More details sent.<br>
09/04/2024 – Second reply.<br>
09/04/2024 – <a href="https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/pull/27629">Proposed fix</a> for the first issue.<br>
10/04/2024 – Multiple emails about the first issue.<br>
02/05/2024 – Request for information about the second issue (which is more severe).<br>
09/05/2024 – Response with assigned <strong>CVE-2024-3656</strong> and request not to release any details: <code>For the moment there is no estimated keycloak version to include the fix</code><br>
27/05/2024 – Request for an update and a timeline for the fix.<br>
11/06/2024 – <a href="https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/security/advisories/GHSA-2cww-fgmg-4jqc">Advisory</a> published without any notification.</p>
<p>Further details are available at:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/security/advisories/GHSA-2cww-fgmg-4jqc">https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/security/advisories/GHSA-2cww-fgmg-4jqc</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2cww-fgmg-4jqc">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2cww-fgmg-4jqc</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Multiple race conditions in anti-brute force mechanism</h3>
<p>Keycloak implements an <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#password-guess-brute-force-attacks">anti-brute force mechanism</a> (which is not enabled by default) which should limit the attack attempts by locking out user accounts after a configured number of incorrect login attempts.</p>
<p>Based on our analysis, the software <strong>didn’t implement mechanisms to prevent concurrent access</strong> to security-critical resources, such as the number of failed authentication attempts. Therefore, it’s possible to <strong>send multiple requests that are processed simultaneously by different threads, allowing the attacker to perform many more login attempts than allowed, and consequently partially bypassing the anti-brute-force mechanism</strong>. Furthermore, when the account is locked out, active sessions are not invalidated.</p>
<p>The issue has been verified both on the username and password-based login and on the OTP request. No checks have been performed on the “Quick Login Check Milliseconds” functionality, but we expect it to be affected by the same issue. The configuration used for testing was set to lockout accounts after 3 incorrect login attempts.</p>
<p>The communication timeline follows:</p>
<p>18/04/2024 – First communication with details.<br>

<h3>Some final considerations</h3>
<p><strong>Authentication is one of the fundamental mechanisms to ensure the security of applications</strong> and Keycloak is considered to be one of the standard open source software on which many organizations rely for their authentication needs.</p>
<p>I am a strong proponent of open source. However, I believe that <strong>those who develop important projects should carefully consider the impact that their work can have</strong>. I think that for a centralized authentication system, a bypass of the two-factor authentication should be solved or at least mitigated in a timely manner: 10 months is a lot of time to fix a core feature of a security product.</p>
<p>Furthermore, communication with security researchers and, crucially, product users should be as clear and explicit as possible. Keycloak’s advisories are very generic and do not allow users to understand what the actual impacts of the vulnerabilities are. <strong>Attackers can easily look at the code, understand it, and exploit any vulnerability, but the poor system administrator who needs to figure out if it’s important to quickly update certainly will not do that…</strong></p>

    <p>November 12, 2024</p>
  </a>
<p><img src="https://jan.miksovsky.com/images/2024/11/momboard.png" alt="E-ink display on a bathroom counter showing birthday messages"></p>
<p>Today marks two years since I first set up an e-ink display in my mom’s apartment to help her live on her own with amnesia. The display has worked extremely well during those two years, so I’m sharing the basic set-up in case others find it useful for similar situations.</p>
<p><em>Note: unless you have specific experience caring for someone who has amnesia but not dementia, please do not offer care suggestions.</em></p>
<h2 id="the-patient">The patient</h2>
<p>In June 2022 the side-effects of a long surgery left my mom with permanent anterograde amnesia: she can no longer form new long-term memories. Memory isn’t just one neurological system, so very occasionally she will able to remember certain types of things. But for the most part, if she hears or sees something, a few minutes later she will no longer remember it.</p>
<p>To medical professionals her condition looks a lot like dementia — amnesia is a common symptom of dementia — but she doesn’t have dementia. One difference is that (as I understand it) dementia is a progressive disease, while this amnesia is stable. There is no cure.</p>
<p>Someday I might post about the experience about caring for her, but for now I’ll just say that this type of amnesia is not something one should wish on one’s worst enemies.</p>
<h2 id="needs">Needs</h2>
<p>My mom still lives on her own in an apartment. Because she cannot remember things, she goes through each day in a state of low-grade anxiety about where her grown children are and whether they are all right. She feels she hasn’t heard from any of us in a long time. This anxiety manifests as extremely frequent attempts to call or text us.</p>
<p>Paper notes and other forms of reminders didn’t seem to help, and would become out of date even if they weren’t misplaced. My siblings and I would call to let her know we were okay, but five minutes later she’d be back to being worried. She wasn’t in the habit of scrolling back through text messages, so once she’d read a message, it was immediately forgotten and effectively lost.</p>
<p>I thought some sort of unobtrusive, always-on device installed in her apartment might be able to show her notes written by my siblings and me.</p>
<h2 id="design-goals">Design goals</h2>
<p>My goal was to find a display that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Could stay on for months on end</li>
<li>Would let my siblings and I easily post short messages to it that would remain visible until replaced</li>
<li>Was large enough and easy enough to read without glasses</li>
<li>Required no interaction to wake or read and was relatively foolproof (touching it wouldn’t disrupt it)</li>
<li>Was resilient to network failures</li>
<li>Didn’t glow at nighttime</li>
<li>Didn’t require hardware hackery (I’m a software person)</li>
<li>Would boot directly into displaying messages (no interaction needed to start an app)</li>
<li>Was not enshittified with a subscription service or proprietary app store</li>
<li>Was reasonably affordable</li>
<li>Would not look out of place in a home</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="device">Device</h2>
<p>Given the above design goals, I searched for a tablet-size electronic ink display with Wi-Fi connectivity and a decent web browser.</p>
<p>One device that seemed to fit my parameters was the <a href="https://shop.boox.com/products/noteair2">BOOX Note Air2 Series</a>. At the time it cost US$500, which is expensive but is still far cheaper than screens intended for use as commercial retail displays. It’s marketed as a note-taking device and ebook reader, but it also has a capable web browser. It’s big enough to read from a few feet away.</p>
<p>A critical question I couldn’t answer online was whether I’d be able to have the device automatically start its web browser and have that browser display a designated start page. Happily, when the device arrived I was able to confirm it could do both of those things.</p>
<p>The physical case of the Note Air2 looks reasonably nice and not particularly tech-y. The e-ink display is clear and legible; it refreshes quickly enough to not be distracting. By default the device’s backlight was turned on but I could turn it off.</p>
<p>I found a small metal stand to serve an easel for the display so that it felt more like a picture frame.</p>
<h2 id="web-software">Web software</h2>
<p>Since the physical device was satisfactory, the next step was writing a simple website that could drive the display. The site would have two pages:</p>
<ol>
<li>A Board page showing the messages. The e-ink device would boot into showing this page. This is the only page my mom needed to see.</li>
<li>A Compose page my siblings and I write messages and save them to be displayed.</li>
</ol>
<p>The device needed to run for months, and needed to be resilient in the case of network and service failures. At the same time, I also needed to be able to remotely update not only the messages being displayed, but the software displaying those messages.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I factored the Board page into an outer frame and an inner page:</p>
<ol>
<li>The top-level outer frame acts as a thin shell around the inner page. At top of every hour, the outer frame reloads the inner page to pick up potential software changes. If the network is down and the inner page doesn’t reload, the frame just tries again an hour later. To maximize reliability, the outer frame has very little logic and no external dependencies.</li>
<li>The inner page actually displays the messages. Every 5 minutes it queries a simple web service for message data and displays the messages. The inner page contains a small amount of logic, but as few dependencies as possible.</li>
</ol>
<p>Since it’s essentially impossible to debug anything that happens on the device, I made as much use of vanilla HTML and CSS as possible. I used a small amount of JavaScript but no framework or other libraries.</p>
<img src="https://jan.miksovsky.com/images/2024/11/compose.png" alt="Compose form for posting a message to the display">

<p>The Compose page presents a simple web form my siblings and I can use to compose and save a message. I designed the form to work well on a phone screen so that we can write messages when we’re out and about. A small web app manifest lets us save the Compose page to a phone’s home screen as an icon for quick access.</p>
<p>The whole site is tiny, entails no build process, and with the exception of the service (below) is just static files.</p>
<h2 id="visual-design">Visual design</h2>
<p>I was concerned about the possibility of e-ink burn-in, so the Board page randomly changes which message appears where. Other visual elements like the date and time alternate from side to side, with the intention that no single pixel is always on.</p>
<p>To style the note text I chose the free <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Architects+Daughter">Architect’s Daughter</a> font for a handwritten feel. This font works well on the e-ink display. Labels are displayed in <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans">Open Sans</a>.</p>
<p>One small challenge was maximizing the size of the message text. Sometimes a message is just a word or two; other times it might be several sentences. A single font size can’t accommodate such a wide range of text content. I couldn’t find a pure CSS way to automatically maximize font size so that a text element with word wrapping would display without clipping.</p>
<p>I ended up writing a small JavaScript function to maximize font size: it makes the text invisible (via CSS <code>visibility: hidden</code>), tries displaying the text at a very large size, and then tries successively smaller font sizes until it finds a size that lets all the text fit. It then makes the text visible again.</p>
<h2 id="service">Service</h2>
<p>Just a tiny amount of text data is necessary to drive the display, so I was happy to find the minimalist <a href="https://www.jsonstorage.net/">JsonStorage</a> service that was perfect for this project. A single JSON object stores the text and metadata for the current set of messages. The Compose page can save to the service with a POST request, and the Board page can retrieve the data with a GET.</p>
<p>The service has a free tier that I started with, but I liked the service so much that I eventually paid for a $1/month basic tier. (It appears that tier is now $5/month.)</p>
<h2 id="trial-and-installation">Trial and installation</h2>
<p>I spent a couple of weeks working on the software and letting it run for long periods of time. I was pleasantly surprised that the Boox display worked as well as it did and seemed to stay up indefinitely.</p>
<p>I brought the display over to my mom’s apartment on November 12, 2022, turned it on, joined it to her Wi-Fi, and rebooted it to confirm everything worked in the new environment.</p>
<p>I thought the bathroom counter might be a good place for it, but my mom thought she’d rather have it in her bedroom, so we found a home for it on a windowsill.</p>
<p>My mom was happy with the display right away.</p>
<h2 id="retrospective">Retrospective</h2>
<p>Despite her amnesia, my mom came to remember that this display exits and what it’s for. She looks forward to seeing updates from her children on it.</p>
<p>If we tell her about something that’s coming up, she often asks whether we’ve already put that event on the MomBoard. On the flip side, we have to be careful to keep it up to date; if we fail to take down a message that no longer applies, it confuses her.</p>
<p>Looking back, the display is essentially the only intervention of any kind we’ve tried that’s actually been successful at improving her quality of life (and ours). One reason it’s worked so well is that it didn’t require her to learn anything new. Without the ability to remember new things, it’s virtually impossible for her to learn a new skill or to form new habits.</p>
<p>The device’s reliability has surpassed my expectations. There was one period where the device seemed to stop working, but I traced the problem to a faulty Wi-Fi hub; after that was replaced, it’s worked flawlessly since. For my part, keeping the software as simple as possible and sticking to vanilla web technologies surely helped avoid bugs.</p>
<p>The display still looks great, and it still displays messages day in and day out.</p>
<p>If you want to try to set up something similar to what I describe here, I’m happy to answer technical questions or share advice.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://mrsuh.com/articles/2024/sqlite-index-visualization-structure/">https://mrsuh.com/articles/2024/sqlite-index-visualization-structure/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42134964">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
<p>After learning about indexes, I understood their basic structure, but I wanted to dig deeper — to explore the data structure, understand the algorithm, and learn how the index data is stored on disk.<br>
The theory and actual implementation can differ, so I decided to explore this topic further.</p>
<p>I wanted to see how a database management system (DBMS) stores an index in both disk and memory, and how it searches through an Index.<br>
I chose SQLite for my experiments:</p>
<ul>
<li>it’s a widely used DBMS, found in browsers, mobile apps, and operating systems;</li>
<li>it's easier to debug: no separate server, just a client-side application;</li>
<li>its codebase is smaller than MySQL or PostgreSQL but uses similar data structures for Indexes;</li>
<li>it’s open-source.</li>
</ul>
<a href="#h2-node-and-page-structure" id="h2-node-and-page-structure"><h2>Node and Page Structure</h2></a>
<p>According to SQLite <a href="https://sqlite.org/fileformat2.html" target="_blank">documentation</a>, Indexes are stored in a B-Tree structure, which is a balanced tree where each node has multiple children.<br>
It typically looks like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://mrsuh.com/articles/2024/sqlite-index-visualization-structure/images/b-tree.svg"><img src="https://mrsuh.com/articles/2024/sqlite-index-visualization-structure/images/b-tree.svg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>To understand how SQLite stores Nodes, let’s look at the Page and Cell structures.<br>
A Page (analog of a Node on SQLite) stores Cells data and has a link to its right child Page.<br>
A Cell contains Index data, a rowId, and a link to its left child Page.<br>
By default, each SQLite table row has a unique rowId, which works like a primary key if one isn’t explicitly defined.</p>
<p>Here’s a visual example of a B-Tree Index in SQLite:</p>
<p><a href="https://mrsuh.com/articles/2024/sqlite-index-visualization-structure/images/b-tree-sqlite.svg"><img src="https://mrsuh.com/articles/2024/sqlite-index-visualization-structure/images/b-tree-sqlite.svg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Index data is stored on disk in this structure:</p>
<p><a href="https://mrsuh.com/articles/2024/sqlite-index-visualization-structure/images/b-tree-store.svg"><img src="https://mrsuh.com/articles/2024/sqlite-index-visualization-structure/images/b-tree-store.svg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Each Page has a fixed size, ranging from 512 to 65,536 bytes. Page and Cell headers use 4 bytes to store child links.<br>
If we want to know child Page number - we need to read the header separately with this function:</p>
<pre><code>get4byte(...)</code></pre>
<p>For other Page and Cell data, we can use these C structures:</p>
<a href="#h3-page" id="h3-page"><h3>Page</h3></a>
<p>sqlite/src/btreeInt.h</p>
<pre><code>struct MemPage {
  Pgno pgno;           /* Page number for this page */
  u16 nCell;           /* Number of cells on this page, local and ovfl */
  u8 *aCellIdx;        /* The cell index area */
  u8 *aData;           /* Pointer to disk image of the page data */ 
  ...
};</code></pre>
<a href="#h3-cell" id="h3-cell"><h3>Cell</h3></a>
<p>sqlite/src/btreeInt.h</p>
<pre><code>struct CellInfo {
  u8 *pPayload;  /* Pointer to the start of payload */
  ...
};</code></pre>
<p>To view index data, we can use <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/sqlanalyze.html" target="_blank">sqlite3 analyzer</a>:</p>
<pre><code>sqlite3_analyzer database.sqlite
...
Page size in bytes................................ 4096      
...
*** Index IDX of table TABLE_TEST *********************************************  
Number of entries................................. 1000      
B-tree depth...................................... 2         
Total pages used.................................. 4        
..</code></pre>
<p>This tool provides only general information about index.</p>
<a href="#h2-analyzing-sqlite-source-code" id="h2-analyzing-sqlite-source-code"><h2>Analyzing SQLite Source Code</h2></a>
<p>After a few weeks of experimenting, I wrote my functions for index analysis.</p>
<p>You can view the code <a href="https://github.com/mrsuh/sqlite-index/blob/main/sqlite.patch" target="_blank">here</a>:</p>
<pre><code>char *sqlite3DebugGetMemoryPayload(Mem *mem);

char **sqlite3DebugGetCellPayloadAndRowId(BtCursor *pCur, MemPage *pPage, int cellIndex);

void sqlite3DebugBtreeIndexDump(BtCursor *pCur, int pageNumber);</code></pre>
<p>The function reads the content of selected index and outputting data to STDOUT:</p>
<pre><code>SQL query -&gt; selected index -&gt; stdout</code></pre>
<p>Here’s an example output:</p>
<pre><code>sqlite3BtreeIndexDump: page, number=3, rightChildPageNumber=99
sqlite3BtreeIndexDump: cell, number=0, leftChildPageNumber=7, payload=384, rowId=384
sqlite3BtreeIndexDump: cell, number=1, leftChildPageNumber=8, payload=742, rowId=742
...</code></pre>
<p>I packed everything into a docker if you want to test it: </p>
<pre><code>docker run -it --rm -v "$PWD":/app/data --platform linux/x86_64 mrsuh/sqlite-index bash</code></pre>
<p>You can use the script like this:</p>
<pre><code>sh bin/dump-index.sh database.sqlite "SELECT * FROM table INDEXED BY index WHERE column=1" dump.txt</code></pre>
<p>dump.txt</p>
<pre><code>sqlite3BtreeIndexDump: page, number=3, rightChildPageNumber=99
sqlite3BtreeIndexDump: cell, number=0, leftChildPageNumber=7, payload=384, rowId=384
sqlite3BtreeIndexDump: cell, number=1, leftChildPageNumber=8, payload=742, rowId=742
...
sqlite3BtreeIndexDump: page, number=99, rightChildPageNumber=-1
sqlite3BtreeIndexDump: cell, number=0, leftChildPageNumber=-1, payload=9642, rowId=9642
sqlite3BtreeIndexDump: cell, number=1, leftChildPageNumber=-1, payload=9643, rowId=9643
...
sqlite3BtreeIndexDump: page, number=7, rightChildPageNumber=-1
sqlite3BtreeIndexDump: cell, number=0, leftChildPageNumber=-1, payload=1, rowId=1
sqlite3BtreeIndexDump: cell, number=1, leftChildPageNumber=-1, payload=2, rowId=2
...</code></pre>
<p>Great!<br>
The next step was to display everything visually — an easy part of the process.</p>
<p>I found a library called <a href="https://github.com/benyasin/d3-org-tree" target="_blank">d3-org-tree</a> for visualizing index structures.<br>
Here’s how it looked in the early stages:</p>
<p><a href="https://mrsuh.com/articles/2024/sqlite-index-visualization-structure/images/test-tree-d3.png"><img src="https://mrsuh.com/articles/2024/sqlite-index-visualization-structure/images/test-tree-d3.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>However, there was a problem: I couldn’t adjust the spacing between Pages, so as the tree became deeper and more Pages were added at each level, the image became too large and hard to read.</p>
<p><a href="https://mrsuh.com/articles/2024/sqlite-index-visualization-structure/images/test-tree-d3-wide.png"><img src="https://mrsuh.com/articles/2024/sqlite-index-visualization-structure/images/test-tree-d3-wide.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>I tried adjusting it with JavaScript and CSS, but it didn’t work well.<br>
After a few tries with d3-org-tree, I decided that using text to display the structure would be simpler.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<p>Not bad, but I could go further.<br>
PHP's <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/intro.imagick.php" target="_blank">ImageMagick</a> extension lets us create images with more control over design and spacing than text alone. After about a dozen tries, here's the final version I came up with:</p>
<p><a href="https://mrsuh.com/articles/2024/sqlite-index-visualization-structure/images/test-tree-php.webp"><img src="https://mrsuh.com/articles/2024/sqlite-index-visualization-structure/images/test-tree-php.webp" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The image now includes all the needed data and is easy to read.</p>
<p>In the top-left corner, there’s general information about the Index.<br>
Each level shows the total number of Pages and Cells.<br>
Each Page shows its Page number, the link to its right child, and details about the first and last Cell.<br>
Only a few Pages are shown per level, including the first and last Pages for each level.<br>
The root Page is located at the first level.</p>
<p>Use this command to generate an image from the dump </p>
<pre><code>php bin/console app:render-index --dumpIndexPath=dump.txt --outputImagePath=image.webp</code></pre>
<p>Now it's time to experiment!</p>
<p>We can create different data for the Indexes and explore what's inside them.<br>
To start, it would be interesting to see how the Index size grows from 1 to 1,000,000 records.<br>
Before each Index image, I'll show the table's data structure, the way the Index was made, and how the table was filled with data.</p>
<a href="#h2-index-with-1-record" id="h2-index-with-1-record"><h2>Index with 1 record</h2></a>
<pre><code>CREATE TABLE table_test (column1 INT NOT NULL);
INSERT INTO table_test (column1) VALUES (1);
CREATE INDEX idx ON table_test (column1 ASC);</code></pre>

<p>One level, one Page, one Cell. Simple!</p>
<a href="#h2-index-with-1000-records" id="h2-index-with-1000-records"><h2>Index with 1000 records</h2></a>
<pre><code>CREATE TABLE table_test (column1 INT NOT NULL);

<p>Now we’ve reached the image I used earlier as an example.<br>
This Index has 3 levels, 2,930 Pages, and 1,000,000 Cells. The data was added in order, so for rowId = 1, column1 = 1.</p>
<a href="#h2-comparing-asc-and-desc-indexes" id="h2-comparing-asc-and-desc-indexes"><h2>Comparing ASC and DESC Indexes</h2></a>
<p>Now, let's add two Indexes with different sort directions.</p>
<pre><code>CREATE TABLE table_test (column1 INT NOT NULL);
INSERT INTO table_test (column1) VALUES (1),(2),(3),...,(999998),(999999),(1000000);
CREATE INDEX idx_asc ON table_test (column1 ASC);
CREATE INDEX idx_desc ON table_test (column1 DESC);</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://mrsuh.com/articles/2024/sqlite-index-visualization-structure/images/index-order-asc.webp"><img src="https://mrsuh.com/articles/2024/sqlite-index-visualization-structure/images/index-order-asc.webp" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The ASC Index is the same as above, as ASC sorting is used by default.<br>
The table's first entry, rowId=1,000,000, column1=1,000,000, payload=1,000,000, is in the last Cell of the rightmost Page.<br>
The table's last entry, rowId=1, column1=1, payload=1, is in the first Cell of the leftmost Page.</p>
<p><a href="https://mrsuh.com/articles/2024/sqlite-index-visualization-structure/images/index-order-desc.webp"><img src="https://mrsuh.com/articles/2024/sqlite-index-visualization-structure/images/index-order-desc.webp" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The DESC Index is reversed.<br>
The table's first entry, rowId=1, column1=1, payload=1, is in the last Cell of the rightmost Page.<br>
The table's last entry, rowId=1,000,000, column1=1,000,000, payload=1,000,000, is in the first Cell of the leftmost Page.</p>
<a href="#h2-index-with-expression-based-data" id="h2-index-with-expression-based-data"><h2>Index with expression-based data</h2></a>
<pre><code>CREATE TABLE table_test (column1 TEXT NOT NULL);
INSERT INTO table_test (column1) VALUES ('{"timestamp":1}'),('{"timestamp":2}'),('{"timestamp":3}'),...,('{"timestamp":999998}'),('{"timestamp":999999}'),('{"timestamp":1000000}');
CREATE INDEX idx ON table_test (strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S', json_extract(column1, '$.timestamp'), 'unixepoch') ASC);</code></pre>

<p>The Index now stores a string generated by the expression.<br>
You can use more complex expressions, and the Index will save the only result.</p>
<a href="#h2-unique-index-with-null-values" id="h2-unique-index-with-null-values"><h2>Unique Index with NULL values</h2></a>
<pre><code>CREATE TABLE table_test (column1 INT)
INSERT INTO table_test (column1) VALUES (1),(NULL),(NULL),...,(NULL),(NULL),(1000000);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx ON table_test (column1 ASC);</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://mrsuh.com/articles/2024/sqlite-index-visualization-structure/images/index-unique.webp"><img src="https://mrsuh.com/articles/2024/sqlite-index-visualization-structure/images/index-unique.webp" alt=""></a></p>
<p>SQLite supports unique Indexes with NULL values.<br>
This index looks like we are storing only non-NULL values.</p>
<a href="#h2-filtering-null-values-with-partial-indexes" id="h2-filtering-null-values-with-partial-indexes"><h2>Filtering NULL Values with Partial Indexes</h2></a>
<pre><code>CREATE TABLE table_test (column1 INT)

CREATE INDEX idx ON table_test (column1 ASC) WHERE column1 IS NOT NULL;</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://mrsuh.com/articles/2024/sqlite-index-visualization-structure/images/index-partial.webp"><img src="https://mrsuh.com/articles/2024/sqlite-index-visualization-structure/images/index-partial.webp" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The Index now contains just one Page, leading to faster searches than the previous example.</p>
<a href="#h2-multi-column-index" id="h2-multi-column-index"><h2>Multi-Column Index</h2></a>
<pre><code>CREATE TABLE table_test (column1 INT NOT NULL, column2 INT NOT NULL);
INSERT INTO table_test (column1, column2) VALUES (1,1),(2,2),(3,3),...,(999998,999998),(999999,999999),(1000000,1000000);
CREATE INDEX idx ON table_test (column1 ASC, column2 ASC);</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://mrsuh.com/articles/2024/sqlite-index-visualization-structure/images/index-complex.webp"><img src="https://mrsuh.com/articles/2024/sqlite-index-visualization-structure/images/index-complex.webp" alt=""></a></p>
<p>As we can see, the data for all fields in a cell are stored one after another.<br>
The fields are separated visually with a colon <code>:</code>.</p>
<a href="#h2-comparing-indexes-created-before-and-after-data-population" id="h2-comparing-indexes-created-before-and-after-data-population"><h2>Comparing Indexes Created Before and After Data Population</h2></a>
<pre><code>CREATE TABLE table_test (column1 INT NOT NULL);

INSERT INTO table_test (column1) VALUES (1),(2),(3),...,(999998),(999999),(1000000);

<p>The tree must rebalance itself when new data is added. Creating an Index on existing data should be much more efficient.<br>
Both Indexes look similar, but the second Index, with fewer Pages, should be faster.</p>
<pre><code>+--------+-------------+-------------+
|        | Total Pages | Total Cells |
+--------+-------------+-------------+
| Before | 3342        | 1000000     |
| After  | 2930        | 1000000     |
+--------+-------------+-------------+</code></pre>
<a href="#h2-vacuum-and-reindex" id="h2-vacuum-and-reindex"><h2>VACUUM and REINDEX</h2></a>
<p>To achieve similar optimization, we can rebuild an existing Index with these commands:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sqlite.org/lang_vacuum.html" target="_blank">VACUUM</a> recreates Indexes and tables with data:</p>
<pre><code>CREATE TABLE table_test (column1 INT NOT NULL);
CREATE INDEX idx ON table_test (column1 ASC);
INSERT INTO table_test (column1) VALUES (1),(2),(3),...,(999998),(999999),(1000000);
VACUUM;</code></pre>
<pre><code>+--------+-------------+-------------+
|        | Total Pages | Total Cells |
+--------+-------------+-------------+
| Before | 3342        | 1000000     |
| After  | 2930        | 1000000     |
+--------+-------------+-------------+</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://www.sqlite.org/lang_reindex.html" target="_blank">REINDEX</a> -  recreates Indexes only:</p>
<pre><code>CREATE TABLE table_test (column1 INT NOT NULL);
CREATE INDEX idx ON table_test (column1 ASC);
INSERT INTO table_test (column1) VALUES (1),(2),(3),...,(999998),(999999),(1000000);
REINDEX idx;</code></pre>
<pre><code>+--------+-------------+-------------+
|        | Total Pages | Total Cells |
+--------+-------------+-------------+
| Before | 3342        | 1000000     |
| After  | 2930        | 1000000     |
+--------+-------------+-------------+</code></pre>
<p>After running VACUUM/REINDEX, the number of Pages in the Index decreased a lot. </p>
<a href="#h2-text-data-in-indexes" id="h2-text-data-in-indexes"><h2>Text Data in Indexes</h2></a>
<p>Let's look at how text is stored. Short strings are saved directly in the Index Cells, but longer text must be stored separately.</p>
<pre><code>CREATE TABLE table_test (column1 text NOT NULL);
INSERT INTO table_test (column1) VALUES ('text-1'),('text-2'),('text-3'),...,('text-999998'),('text-999999'),('text-1000000');
CREATE INDEX idx ON table_test (column1 ASC);</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://mrsuh.com/articles/2024/sqlite-index-visualization-structure/images/index-text.webp"><img src="https://mrsuh.com/articles/2024/sqlite-index-visualization-structure/images/index-text.webp" alt=""></a></p>
<p>You can easily see the actual string stored directly in the Index.</p>
<a href="#h2-float-point-data-in-indexes" id="h2-float-point-data-in-indexes"><h2>Float-point Data in Indexes</h2></a>
<pre><code>CREATE TABLE table_test (column1 REAL NOT NULL);
INSERT INTO table_test (column1) VALUES ('1.14'),('2.14'),('3.14'),...,('999998.14'),('999999.14'),('1000000.14');
CREATE INDEX idx ON table_test (column1 ASC);</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://mrsuh.com/articles/2024/sqlite-index-visualization-structure/images/index-real.webp"><img src="https://mrsuh.com/articles/2024/sqlite-index-visualization-structure/images/index-real.webp" alt=""></a></p>
<a href="#h2-combining-integer-and-text-in-a-single-index:" id="h2-combining-integer-and-text-in-a-single-index:"><h2>Combining integer and text in a single Index:</h2></a>
<pre><code>CREATE TABLE table_test (column1 INT NOT NULL, column2 TEXT NOT NULL);
INSERT INTO table_test (column1, column2) VALUES (1,'text-1'),(2,'text-2'),(3,'text-3'),...,(999998,'text-999998'),(999999,'text-999999'),(1000000,'text-1000000');
CREATE INDEX idx ON table_test (column1 ASC, column2 ASC);</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://mrsuh.com/articles/2024/sqlite-index-visualization-structure/images/index-integer-text.webp"><img src="https://mrsuh.com/articles/2024/sqlite-index-visualization-structure/images/index-integer-text.webp" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The integer and string are stored together in the Cell, just as we specified when creating the Index.</p>
<a href="#h2-conclusion" id="h2-conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2></a>
<p>Based on the work done, we saw how Indexes in SQLite are structured.<br>
We looked at how record data is stored in memory and how the B-Tree organizes and accesses this data.<br>
The visualization helped analyze and compare different Indexes.</p>
<p>To reproduce all of these examples, you can run the following:</p>
<pre><code>docker run -it --rm -v "$PWD":/app/data --platform linux/x86_64 mrsuh/sqlite-index bash
sh bin/test-index.sh</code></pre>
<p>Code and examples are available <a href="https://github.com/mrsuh/sqlite-index" target="_blank">here</a></p>
<p>Next, I'll focus on visualizing Index-based searches and explore some interesting SQL queries.</p>

Gwern is an anonymous researcher and writer. He’s deeply influenced the people building </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence" rel="">AGI</a><span>. He was one of the first people to see </span><a href="https://gwern.net/scaling-hypothesis" rel="">LLM scaling</a><span> coming. If you’ve read his blog, you’ll know he’s one of the most interesting polymathic thinkers alive. We recorded this conversation in person. In order to protect Gwern’s anonymity, we created this avatar. This isn’t his voice. This isn’t his face. But these are his words.</span></p><p>What is the most underrated benefit of anonymity?</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong></p><p>The most underrated benefit of anonymity is that people don't project onto you as much. They can't slot you into any particular niche or identity and write you off in advance. They have to at least read you a little bit to even begin to dismiss you.</p><p>It's great that people cannot retaliate against you. I have derived a lot of benefit from people not being able to mail heroin to my home and call the police to SWAT me. But I always feel that the biggest benefit is just that you get a hearing at all. You don't get immediately written off by the context.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong></p><p>Do you expect companies&nbsp; to be automated top-down (starting with the CEO) or bottom-up (starting with all the workers)?</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong></p><p>All of the pressures are to go bottom-up. From existing things, it's just much more palatable in every way to start at the bottom and replace there and work your way up, to eventually where you just have human executives overseeing a firm of AIs.</p><p><span>Also from a </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning" rel="">RL</a><span> perspective, if we are in fact better than AIs in some way, it should be in the long-term vision thing. The AI will be too myopic to execute any kind of novel long-term strategy and seize new opportunities.</span></p><p>That would presumably give you this paradigm where you have a human CEO who does the vision thing. And then the AI corporation scurries around doing his bidding. They don't have the taste that the CEO has. You have one Steve Jobs-type at the helm, and then maybe a whole pyramid of AIs out there executing it and bringing him new proposals. He looks at every individual thing and says, “No, that proposal is bad. This one is good.”</p><p>That may be hard to quantify, but the human-led firms should, under this view, then outcompete the entirely AI firms, which would keep making myopic choices that just don't quite work out in the long term.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong></p><p>What is the last thing you’d be personally doing?&nbsp; What is the last keystroke that gets automated for you?</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>The last thing that I see myself still doing right before the nanobots start eating me from the bottom up and I start screaming, “No, I specifically requested the opposite of this….” Right before that, I think what I'm still doing is the Steve Jobs-thing of choosing. My AI minions are bringing me wonderful essays. I'm saying, “This one is better. This is the one that I like,” and possibly building on that and saying, “That's almost right, but you know what would make it really good? If you pushed it to 11 in this way.”</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong></p><p>If we do have firms that are made up of AIs, what do you expect the unit of selection to be? Will it be individual models? Will it be the firm as a whole? With humans, we have these debates about whether it’s kin-level selection, individual-level selection, or gene-level selection. What will it be for the AIs?</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>Once you can replicate individual models perfectly, the unit of selection can move way up and you can do much larger groups and packages of minds. That would be an obvious place to start. You can train individual minds in a differentiable fashion, but then you can't really train the interaction between them. You will have groups of models or minds of people who just work together really well in a global sense, even if you can't attribute it to any particular aspect of their interactions. There are some places you go and people just work well together. There's nothing specific about it, but for whatever reason they all just click in just the right way.</p><p>That seems like the most obvious unit of selection. You would have packages—I guess possibly department units—where you have a programmer and a manager type, then you have maybe a secretary type, maybe a financial type, a legal type. This is the default package where you just copy everywhere you need a new unit. At this level, you can start evolving them and making random variations to each and then keep the one that performs best.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>By when could one have foreseen the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity" rel="">Singularity</a><span>? Obviously, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Moravec" rel="">Moravec</a><span> and others are talking about it in the eighties and nineties. You could have done it decades earlier. When was the earliest you could have seen where things were headed?</span></p><p><strong>Gwern</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>If you want to trace the genealogy there, you'd have to at least go back as far as </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Butler_(novelist)" rel="">Samuel Butler's</a><span> </span><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erewhon" rel="">Erewhon</a></em><span> in 1872 or </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_among_the_Machines" rel="">his essay before that</a><span>. In 1863, he describes explicitly his vision of a machine life becoming ever more developed until eventually it’s autonomous. At which point, that's a threat to the human race. This is why he concluded, </span><a href="https://ndhadeliver.natlib.govt.nz/webarchive/20210104000423/http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-ButFir-t1-g1-t1-g1-t4-body.html" rel="">“war to the death should be instantly proclaimed against them.”</a><span> That’s prescient for 1863! I'm not sure that anyone has given a clear Singularity scenario earlier than that. The idea of technological progress was still relatively new at that point.</span></p><p><span>I love the example of </span><a href="https://gwern.net/newton" rel="">Isaac Newton looking at the rates of progress in Newton's time</a><span> and going, “Wow, there's something strange here. Stuff is being invented now. We're making progress. How is that possible?” And then coming up with the answer, “Well, progress is possible now because civilization gets destroyed every couple of thousand years, and all we're doing is we're rediscovering the old stuff.”</span></p><p><span>That's Newton's explanation for technological acceleration. We can't actually have any kind of </span><em>real</em><span> technological acceleration. It must be because the world gets destroyed periodically and we just can't see past the last reset.</span></p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>It’s almost like </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox" rel="">Fermi's paradox</a><span>, but for different civilizations across time with respect to each other instead of aliens across space.</span></p><p><strong>Gwern</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Yeah. It turns out even </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucretius" rel="">Lucretius</a><span>, around 1,700 years before that, is </span><a href="https://gwern.net/newton#lucretius" rel="">writing the same argument</a><span>. “Look at all these wonderful innovations and arts and sciences that we Romans have compiled together in the Roman empire! This is amazing, but it can't actually be a recent acceleration in technology. Could that be real? No, that’s crazy. </span><em>Obviously</em><span>, the world was recently destroyed.”</span></p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>Interesting.</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>It is, it is.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>What is the grand parsimonious theory of intelligence going to look like? It seems like you have all of these trends across different fields—like scaling laws in AI, like the scaling of the human brain when we went from primates to humans, the </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6772266/" rel="">uniformity of the neocortex</a><span>—and basically many other things which seem to be pointing towards some grand theory that should exist which explains what intelligence is. What do you think that will look like?</span></p><p><strong>Gwern</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The 10,000 foot view of intelligence, that I think the success of scaling points to, is that all intelligence is is search over </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine" rel="">Turing machines</a><span>. Anything that happens can be described by Turing machines of various lengths. All we are doing when we are doing “learning,” or when we are doing “scaling,” is that we're searching over more and longer Turing machines, and we are applying them in each specific case.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Otherwise, there is no general master algorithm. There is no special intelligence fluid. It's just a tremendous number of special cases that we learn and we encode into our brains.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>I don’t know. When I look at the ways in which my smart friends are smart, it just feels more like a general horsepower kind of thing. They've just got more juice. That seems more compatible with this master algorithm perspective rather than this Turing machine perspective. It doesn’t really feel like they’ve got this long tail of Turing machines that they’ve learned. How does this picture account for variation in human intelligence?</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong></p><p>Well, yeah. When we talk about more or less intelligence, it's just that they have more compute in order to do search over more Turing machines for longer. I don’t think there's anything else other than that. So from any learned brain you could extract small solutions to specific problems, because all the large brain is doing with the compute is finding it.</p><p><span>That's why you never find any “IQ gland”. There is nowhere in the brain where, if you hit it, you eliminate </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_and_crystallized_intelligence" rel="">fluid intelligence</a><span>. This doesn’t exist. Because what your brain is doing is a lot of learning of individual specialized problems. Once those individual problems are learned, then they get recombined for fluid intelligence. And that's just, you know… intelligence.</span></p><p><span>Typically with a large </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network_(machine_learning)" rel="">neural network</a><span> model, you can always pull out a small model which does a specific task equally well. Because that's all the large model is. It's just a gigantic ensemble of small models tailored to the ever-escalating number of tiny problems you have been feeding them.</span></p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>If intelligence is just search over Turing machines—and of course intelligence is tremendously valuable and useful—doesn't that make it more surprising that intelligence took this long to evolve in humans?</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>Not really, I would actually say that it helps explain why human-level intelligence is not such a great idea and so rare to evolve. Because any small Turing machine could always be encoded more directly by your genes, with sufficient evolution. You have these organisms where their entire neural network is just hard-coded by the genes. So if you could do that, obviously that's way better than some sort of colossally expensive, unreliable, glitchy search process—like what humans implement—which takes whole days, in some cases, to learn. Whereas you could be hardwired right from birth.&nbsp;</p><p>For many creatures, it just doesn't pay to be intelligent because that's not actually adaptive. There are better ways to solve the problem than a general purpose intelligence.</p><p>In any kind of niche where it's static, or where intelligence will be super expensive, or where you don't have much time because you're a short-lived organism, it's going to be hard to evolve a general purpose learning mechanism when you could instead evolve one that's tailored to the specific problem that you encounter.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong></p><p><span>You're one of the only people outside </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI" rel="">OpenAI</a><span> in 2020 who had a picture of the way in which AI was progressing and had a very detailed theory, an empirical theory of scaling in particular. I’m curious what processes you were using at the time which allowed you to see the picture you painted in the</span><a href="https://gwern.net/scaling-hypothesis" rel=""> “Scaling Hypothesis” post</a><span> that you wrote at the time.</span></p><p><strong>Gwern</strong></p><p><span>If I had to give an intellectual history of that for me, it would start in the mid-2000s when I’m reading Moravec and </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Kurzweil" rel="">Ray Kurzweil</a><span>. At the time, they're making this kind of fundamental connectionist argument that if you had enough computing power, that could result in discovering the neural network architecture that matches the human brain. And that until that happens, until that amount of computing power is available, AI is basically futile.</span></p><p>To me, I found this argument very unlikely, because it’s very much a “build it and they will come” view of progress, which at the time I just did not think was correct. I thought it was ludicrous to suggest that simply because there’s some supercomputer out there which matches the human brain, then that would just summon out of nonexistence the correct algorithm.</p><p>Algorithms are really complex and hard! They require deep insight—or at least I thought they did. It seemed like really difficult mathematics. You can't just buy a bunch of computers and expect to get this advanced AI out of it! It just seemed like magical thinking.&nbsp;</p><p><span>So I knew the argument, but I was super skeptical. I didn't pay too much attention, but </span><a href="https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/shane-legg" rel="">Shane Legg</a><span> and some others were very big on this in the years following. And as part of my interest in </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism" rel="">transhumanism</a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/" rel="">LessWrong</a><span> and AI risk, I was paying close attention to </span><a href="https://www.vetta.org/2009/12/tick-tock-tick-tock-bing/" rel="">Legg’s blog posts</a><span> </span><a href="https://www.vetta.org/2009/12/the-teenies/" rel="">where</a><span> </span><a href="https://www.vetta.org/2010/12/goodbye-2010/" rel="">he's</a><span> extrapolating out the trend with updated numbers from Kurzweil and Moravec. And he's giving very precise predictions about how we’re going to get the first generalist system around 2019, as </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law" rel="">Moore's law</a><span> keeps going. And then around 2025, we'll get the first human-ish agents with generalist capabilities. Then by 2030, we should have AGI.</span></p><p><span>Along the way, </span><a href="https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/DanNet-triggers-deep-CNN-revolution-2011.html" rel="">DanNet</a><span> and </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlexNet" rel="">AlexNet</a><span> came out. When those came out I was like, “Wow, that's a very impressive success story of connectionism. But </span><em>is</em><span> it just an isolated success story? Or is this what Kurzweil and Moravec and Legg were predicting— that we would get GPUs and then better algorithms would just show up?”</span></p><p><span>So I started thinking to myself that this is something to keep an eye on. Maybe this is not quite as stupid an idea as I had originally thought. I just keep reading </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning" rel="">deep learning</a><span> literature and noticing again and again that the dataset size keeps getting bigger. The models keep getting bigger. The GPUs slowly crept up from one GPU—the cheapest consumer GPU—to two, and then they were eventually training on eight.</span></p><p><span>And you can just see the fact that the neural networks keep expanding from these incredibly niche use cases that do next to nothing. The use just kept getting broader and broader and broader. I would say to myself, “Wow, is there anything </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network" rel="">CNNs</a><span> can't do?” I would just see people apply CNN to something else every individual day on arXiv.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>So for me it was this gradual trickle of drops hitting me in the background as I was going along with my life. Every few days, another drop would fall. I’d go, “Huh? Maybe intelligence really </span><em>is</em><span> just a lot of compute applied to a lot of data, applied to a lot of parameters. Maybe Moravec and Legg and Kurzweil were right.” I’d just note that, and continue on, thinking to myself, “Huh, if that was true, it would have a lot of implications.”</span></p><p><span>So there was no real eureka moment there. It was just continually watching this trend that no one else seemed to see, except possibly a handful of people like </span><a href="https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/ilya-sutskever" rel="">Ilya Sutskever</a><span>, or </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%BCrgen_Schmidhuber" rel="">Schmidhuber</a><span>. I would just pay attention and notice that the world over time looked more like their world than it looked like my world, where algorithms are super important and you need like deep insight to do stuff. Their world just kept happening.</span></p><p><span>And then </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-1" rel="">GPT-1</a><span> comes out and I was like, “Wow, this unsupervised sentiment neuron is just learning on its own. That's pretty amazing.” It was also a very compute-centric view. You just build the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(deep_learning_architecture)" rel="">Transformer</a><span> and the intelligence will come.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>And then </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-2" rel="">GPT-2</a><span> comes out and I had this “holy shit!” moment. You look at the prompting and the summarization: “Holy shit, do we live in </span><em>their</em><span> world?</span></p><p><span>And then </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3" rel="">GPT-3</a><span> comes out and that was the crucial test. It's a big, big scale-up. It's one of the biggest scale-ups in all </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_neural_networks" rel="">neural network history</a><span>. Going from GPT-2 to GPT-3, that's not a super narrow specific task like </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo" rel="">Go</a><span>. It really seemed like it was the crucial test. If scaling was bogus, then the </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165" rel="">GPT-3 paper</a><span> should just be unimpressive and wouldn't show anything important. Whereas if scaling was true, you would just automatically be guaranteed to get so much more impressive results out of it than GPT-2.</span></p><p><span>I opened up the first page, maybe the second page, and I saw the few-shot learning chart. And I'm like, “Holy shit, we </span><em>are</em><span> living in the scaling world. </span><em>Legg and Moravec and Kurzweil were right!</em><span>”</span></p><p><span>And then I turned to Twitter and everyone else was like, “Oh, you know, this shows that scaling works so badly. Why, it's not even state-of-the-art!” That made me so angry I had to write all this up. </span><a href="https://xkcd.com/386/" rel="">Someone was wrong on the Internet.</a></p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>I remember in 2020, people were writing bestselling books about AI. It was definitely a thing people were talking about, but people were not noticing the most salient things in retrospect: </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model" rel="">LLMs</a><span>, GPT-3, scaling laws. All these people who are talking about AI but missing this crucial crux, what were they getting wrong?</span></p><p><strong>Gwern</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>I think for the most part they were suffering from two issues. First, they had not been paying attention to all of the scaling results before that which were relevant. They had not really appreciated the fact that, for example, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaZero" rel="">AlphaZero</a><span> was discovered in part by </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_DeepMind" rel="">DeepMind</a><span> doing </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.06855#deepmind" rel="">Bayesian optimization on the hyperparameters</a><span> and noticing that you could just get rid of more and more of the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal" rel="">tree search</a><span> as you went and you got better models. That was a critical insight, which could only have been gained by having so much compute power that you could afford to train many, many versions and see the difference that that made.</span></p><p><span>Similarly, those people simply did not know about </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00409" rel="">the Baidu paper on scaling laws in 2017</a><span>, which showed that the scaling laws just keep going and going forever, practically. It should have been the most important paper of the year, but a lot of people just did not prioritize it. It didn't have any immediate implication, and so it sort of got forgotten. People were too busy discussing Transformers or AlphaZero or something to really notice it.</span></p><p><span>So that was one issue. Another issue is that they shared the basic error I was making about algorithms being more important than compute. This was, in part, due to a systematic falsification of the actual origins of ideas in the research literature. Papers do not tell you where the ideas come from in a truthful manner. They just tell you a nice sounding story about how it was discovered. They don’t tell you how it’s </span><em>actually</em><span> discovered.</span></p><p><span>So even if you appreciate the role of </span><a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/next/2015/12/10/microsoft-researchers-win-imagenet-computer-vision-challenge/" rel="">trial and error</a><span> and compute power in your own experiment as a researcher, you probably just think, “Oh, I got lucky that way. My experience is unrepresentative. Over in the next lab, there they do things by the power of thought and deep insight.”</span></p><p>Then it turns out that everywhere you go, compute and data, trial and error, and serendipity play enormous roles in how things actually happened. Once you understand that, then you understand why compute comes first. You can't do trial and error and serendipity without it. You can write down all these beautiful ideas, but you just can't test them out.</p><p>Even a small difference in hyperparameters, or a small choice of architecture, can make a huge difference to the results. When you only can do a few instances, you would typically find that it doesn't work, and you would give up and you would go away and do something else.</p><p>Whereas if you had more compute power, you could keep trying. Eventually, you hit something that works great. Once you have a working solution, you can simplify it and improve it and figure out why it worked and get a nice, robust solution that would work no matter what you did to it. But until then, you're stuck. You're just flailing around in this regime where nothing works.</p><p><span>So you have this horrible experience going through the old deep learning literature and seeing all sorts of contemporary ideas people had back then, which were completely correct. But they didn't have the compute to train what you know would have worked. It’s just tremendously tragic. You can look at things like </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residual_neural_network#Previous_work" rel="">ResNets</a><span> being published back in </span><a href="https://gwern.net/doc/ai/nn/fully-connected/1988-lang.pdf" rel="">1988</a><span>, instead of 2015.</span></p><p><span>And it would have worked! It </span><em>did</em><span> work, but at such a small scale that it was irrelevant. You couldn't use it for anything real. It just got forgotten, so you had to wait until 2015 for ResNets to actually come along and be a revolution in deep learning.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>So that’s kind of the double bias of why you would believe that scaling was not going to work. You did not notice the results that were key, in retrospect, like the </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.11096" rel="">BigGAN</a><span> scaling to 300 million images. There are still people today who would tell you with a straight face that </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network" rel="">GANs</a><span> cannot scale past millions of images. They just don't know that BigGAN handled 300 million images without a sweat. If you don't know that, well you probably would easily think, “Oh, GANs are broken.” But if you do know that, then you think to yourself, “How can algorithms be so important when all these different generative architectures </span><em>all</em><span> work so well—as long as you have lots and lots of GPUs?” That's the common ingredient. You have to have lots and lots of GPUs.</span></p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong></p><p>What do your timelines look like over the last 20 years? Is AI just monotonically getting closer over time?</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>I would say it was very far away, from like 2005 to 2010. It was somewhere well past like 2050. It was close enough that I thought I might live to see it, but I was not actually sure if there was any reasonable chance.&nbsp;</p><p>But once AlexNet and DanNet came out, then it just kept dropping at a rate of like 2 years per year, every year until now. We just kept on hitting barriers to deep learning and doing better. Regardless of how it was doing it, it was obviously getting way better. It just seemed none of the alternative paradigms were doing well. This one was doing super well.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong></p><p>Was there a time that you felt you had updated too far?</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Yeah, there were a few times I thought I had overshot. I thought people over-updated on AlphaGo. They went too far on AI hype with AlphaGo. Afterwards, when </span><a href="https://openai.com/index/universe/" rel="">pushes into big reinforcement learning efforts</a><span> kind of all fizzled out—like </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI_Five" rel="">post-Dota</a><span>, as the reinforcement learning wasn't working out for solving those hard problems outside of the simulated game universes—then I started thinking, “Okay, maybe we kinda overshot there…”</span></p><p><span>But then GPT came out of nowhere and basically erased all that. It was like, "Oh, shit. Here's how RL is going to work. It's going to be </span><a href="https://gwern.net/doc/ai/nn/2019-lecun-isscctalk-cake.png" rel="">the cherry on the cake</a><span>. We're just going to focus on the cake for a while.” Now we have actually figured out a good recipe for baking a cake, which was not true before.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Before, it seemed like you were going to have to brute-force it end-to-end from the rewards. But now you can do the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yann_LeCun" rel="">LeCun</a><span> thing, of learning fast on generative models and then just doing a little bit of RL on top to make it do something specific.</span></p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>Now that you know that AGI is a thing that's coming, what’s your thinking around how you see your role in this timeline? How are you thinking about how to spend these next few years?</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong></p><p><span>I have been thinking about that quite a lot. What do I </span><em>want</em><span> to do? What would be </span><em>useful</em><span> to do?</span></p><p>I'm doing things now because I want to do them, regardless of whether it will be possible for an AI to do them in like 3 years. I do something because I want to. Because I like it, I find it funny or whatever. Or I think carefully about doing just the human part of it, like laying out a proposal for something.</p><p>If you take seriously the idea of getting AGI in a few years, you don't necessarily have to implement stuff and do it yourself. You can sketch out clearly what you want, and why it would be good and how to do it. And then just wait for the better AGI to come along and actually do it then. Unless there's some really compelling reason to do it right now and pay that cost of your scarce time.</p><p>But otherwise, I’m trying to write more about what is not recorded. Things like preferences and desires and evaluations and judgments. Things that an AI could not replace even in principle.</p><p>The way I like to put it is that “the AI cannot eat ice cream for you”. It cannot decide for you which kind of ice cream you like. Only you can do that. And if anything else did, it would be worthless, because it's not your particular preference.</p><p>That's kind of the rubric. Is this something I want to do regardless of any future AI, because I enjoy it? Or is this something where I'm doing only the human part of it and the AGI can later on do it? Or is this writing down something that is unwritten and thus helping the future AI versions of me?</p><p>So if it doesn't fall under those 3, I have been trying to not do it.&nbsp;</p><p>If you look at it that way, many of the projects that people do now have basically no lasting value. They’re doing things that they don't enjoy, which record nothing ephemeral of value that could not be inferred or generated later on. They are, at best, getting 2 or 3 years of utility out of it before it could have been done by an AI system.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>Wait, your timeline for when an AI could write a Gwern-quality essay is two to three years?</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>Ehmm… I have ideas about how to make it possible, which might not require AGI if it combined my entire corpus. Many potential essay ideas are already mostly done in my corpus. So you don't need to be super intelligent to pull it out.&nbsp;</p><p><span>So let’s talk about AGI in general: the </span><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/No5JpRCHzBrWA4jmS/q-and-a-with-shane-legg-on-risks-from-ai" rel="">Anthropic timeline of 2028</a><span> seems like a good personal planning starting point. Even if you're wrong, you probably weren't going to do a </span><em>lot</em><span> of projects within the next 3 years anyway. It's not like you really lost much by instead just writing down the description. You can always go back and do it yourself if you're wrong.</span></p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong></p><p><span>You wrote an interesting comment about getting your work into the LLM training corpus: </span><a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/08/the-wisdom-of-gwern-why-should-you-write.html" rel="">"there has never been a more vital hinge-y time to write."</a></p><p><span>Do you mean that in the sense that you will be this drop in the bucket that’s steering the </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/30/technology/shoggoth-meme-ai.html" rel="">Shoggoth</a><span> one way or the other? Or do you mean it in the sense of making sure your values and persona persist somewhere in </span><a href="https://samanemami.medium.com/a-comprehensive-guide-to-latent-space-9ae7f72bdb2f" rel="">latent space</a><span>?</span></p><p><strong>Gwern</strong></p><p>I mean both. By writing, you are voting on the future of the Shoggoth using one of the few currencies it acknowledges: tokens it has to predict. If you aren't writing, you are abdicating the future or your role in it. If you think it's enough to just be a good citizen, to vote for your favorite politician, to pick up litter and recycle, the future doesn't care about you.&nbsp;</p><p><span>There are ways to influence the Shoggoth more, but not many. If you don't already occupy a handful of key roles or work at a frontier lab, your influence rounds off to 0, far more than ever before. If there are values you have which are not expressed yet in text, if there are things you like or want, if they aren't reflected online, then to the AI they don't exist. That is dangerously close to </span><em>won't</em><span> exist.&nbsp;</span></p><p>But yes, you are also creating a sort of immortality for yourself personally. You aren't just creating a persona, you are creating your future self too. What self are you showing the LLMs, and how will they treat you in the future?&nbsp;</p><p><span>I give&nbsp; the example of </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/30/technology/ai-chatbot-chatgpt-manipulation.html" rel="">Kevin Roose discovering that current LLMs—all of them, not just GPT-4—now mistreat him</a><span> because of </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/16/technology/bing-chatbot-microsoft-chatgpt.html" rel="">his interactions with Sydney</a><span>, which "revealed" him to be a privacy-invading liar, and they know this whenever they interact with him or discuss him. Usually, when you use a LLM chatbot, it doesn't dislike you </span><em>personally</em><span>! On the flip side, it also means that you can try to write for the persona you would like to become, to mold yourself in the eyes of AI, and thereby help bootstrap yourself.</span></p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong></p><p><span>Things like the </span><a href="https://scrollprize.org/" rel="">Vesuvius Challenge</a><span> show us that we can learn more about the past than we thought possible. They’ve leaked more bits of information that we can recover with new techniques. Apply that to the present and think about what the future superhuman intelligences will be trying to uncover about the current present. What kinds of information do you think are going to be totally inaccessible to the transhumanist historians of the future?</span></p><p><strong>Gwern</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Any kind of </span><a href="https://gwern.net/difference" rel="">stable, long-term characteristics</a><span>, the sort of thing you would still have even if you were hit on the head and had amnesia… Anything like that will be definitely recoverable from all the traces of </span><a href="https://gwern.net//doc/statistics/stylometry/truesight/index" rel="">your writing</a><span>, assuming you're not pathologically private and destroy everything possible. That should all be recoverable.&nbsp;</span></p><p>What won't be recoverable will be everything that you could forget ordinarily: autobiographical information, how you felt at a particular time, what you thought of some movie. All of that is the sort of thing that vanishes and can't be recovered from traces afterwards.&nbsp;</p><p>If it wasn't written down, it wasn't written down.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>What is the biggest unresolved tension in your worldview?</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>The thing I swing back and forth the most on is the relationship between human intelligence and neural network intelligence.&nbsp;</p><p>It's not clear in what sense they are two sides of the same coin, or one is an inferior version of the other. This is something that I constantly go back and forth on: “Humans are awesome.” “No, neural networks are awesome.” Or, “No, both suck.” Or, “Both are awesome, just in different ways.”&nbsp;</p><p>So every day I argue with myself a little bit about why each one is good or bad or how. What is the whole deal there with things like GPT-4 and memorization, but not being creative? Why do humans not remember anything, but we still seem to be so smart? One day I'll argue that language models are sample efficient compared to humans. The next day I'll be arguing the opposite.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>One of the interesting points you made to me last year was that AI might be the most polymathic topic to think about because there’s no field or discipline that is not relevant to thinking about AI. Obviously you need computer science and hardware. But you also need things like primatology and understanding what changed between chimp and human brains, or the ultimate laws of physics that will constrain future AI civilizations. That’s all relevant to understanding AI. I wonder if it’s because of this polymathic nature of thinking about AI. that you’ve been especially productive at it.</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>I'm not sure it was necessary. When I think about others who were correct, like Shane Legg or </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dario_Amodei" rel="">Dario Amodei</a><span>, they don't seem to be all that polymathic. They just have broad intellectual curiosity, broad general understanding, absolutely. But they’re not absurdly polymathic. Clearly you could get to the correct view without being polymathic. That's just how I happen to come to it at this point and the connection I’m making post hoc.</span></p><p><span>It wasn’t like I was using primatology to justify scaling to myself. It's more like I'm now using scaling to think about primatology. Because, obviously, if scaling is true, it has to tell us something about humans and monkeys and all other forms of intelligence. It just has to. If that works, it can't be a coincidence and totally unrelated. I refuse to believe that there are two </span><em>totally unrelated</em><span> kinds of intelligence, or paths to intelligence—where humans, monkeys, guppies, dogs are all one thing, and then neural networks and computers are another thing—and they have absolutely nothing to do with each other.&nbsp;</span></p><p>That's obviously wrong. They can be two sides of the same coin. They can obviously have obscure connections. Maybe one could be a better form or whatever. They can't just be completely unrelated. As if humans finally got to Mars and then simultaneously a bunch of space aliens landed on Mars for the first time and that's how we met. You would never believe that. It would be just too absurd.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong></p><p>What is it that you are trying to maximize in your life?</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong></p><p>I maximize rabbit holes. I love more than anything else, falling into a new rabbit hole. That's what I really look forward to. Like this sudden new idea or area that I had no idea about, where I can suddenly fall into a rabbit hole for a while. Even things that might seem bad are a great excuse for falling into a rabbit hole.</p><p><span>Here’s one example. I buy some catnip for my cat and I waste $10 when I find out that he's catnip-immune. I can now fall into a rabbit hole of the question of “well, why </span><em>are</em><span> some cats catnip-immune? Is this a common thing in other countries? How does it differ in other countries? What </span><em>alternative</em><span> catnip drugs are there?” (It turned out to be quite a few.)</span></p><p>I was wondering, “How can I possibly predict which drug my cat would respond to? Why are they reacting in these different ways?”... Just a wonderful rabbit hole of new questions and topics I can master and get answers to, or create new ones, and exhaust my interest until I find the next rabbit hole I can dig and dive into.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong></p><p>What is the longest rabbit hole you've gone on which didn't lead anywhere satisfying?</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong></p><p><span>That was </span><a href="https://gwern.net/doc/anime/eva/index" rel="">my very old work</a><span> on the anime </span><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion" rel="">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em><span>, which I was very fond of when I was younger. I put a ludicrous amount of work into reading everything ever written about </span><em>Evangelion</em><span> in English and trying to understand its development and why it is the way it is. I never really got a solid answer on that before I burned out on it.&nbsp;</span></p><p>I actually do understand it now by sheer chance many years later. But at this point, I no longer care enough to write about it or try to redo it or finish it. In the end, it all wound up being basically a complete waste.&nbsp;</p><p>I have not used it in any of my other essays much at all. That was really one deep rabbit hole that I almost got to the end of, but I couldn't clinch it.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong></p><p>How do you determine when to quit a rabbit hole? And how many rabbit holes do you concurrently have going on at the same time?</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong></p><p><span>You can only really explore two or three rabbit holes simultaneously. Otherwise, you aren't putting real effort into each one. You’re not really digging the hole, it's not really a rabbit hole. It's just something you are somewhat interested in. A rabbit hole is really obsessive. If you aren't </span><em>obsessed</em><span> with it and continually driven by it, it's not a rabbit hole. That’s my view. I’d say two or three max, if you're spending a lot of time and effort on each one and neglecting everything else.</span></p><p>As for when you exit a rabbit hole, you usually hit a very natural terminus where getting any further answers requires data that do not exist or you have questions that people don't know the answer to. You reach a point where everything dies out and you see no obvious next step.&nbsp;</p><p><span>One example would be when I was interested in analogs to </span><a href="https://gwern.net/nicotine" rel="">nicotine</a><span> that might be better than nicotine. That was a bit of a rabbit hole, but I quickly hit the dead end that there are none. That was a pretty definitive dead end. I couldn't get my hands on the metabolites of nicotine as an alternative. So if there are no analogs and you can't get your hands on the one interesting chemical you find, well that's that. That's a pretty definitive end to that rabbit hole.</span></p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong></p><p>Have you always been the kind of person who falls into rabbit holes? When did this start?</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong></p><p>Oh, yeah. My parents could tell you all about that. I was very much your stereotypical nerdy little kid having the dinosaur phase and the construction equipment phase and the submarine and tank phase.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong></p><p>Many kids are into “those things,” but they don't rabbit hole to the extent that they’re forming taxonomies about the different submarines and flora and fauna and dinosaurs, and developing theories of why they came to be and so forth.</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong></p><p>Well, I think it's more that people grow out of being very into rabbit holes as a kid. For me, it was not so much that I was all that exceptional in having obsessions as a kid.&nbsp;</p><p><span>It’s more that they never really stopped. The tank phase would be replaced by my </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcatraz_Island" rel="">Alcatraz</a><span> phase where I would go to the public library and check out everything they had about Alcatraz. That would be replaced by another phase where I was obsessed with ancient Japanese literature. I would check out everything that the library had about Japanese literature before the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku" rel="">haiku</a><span> era. The process of falling into these obsessions kept going for me.</span></p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong></p><p>By the way, do you mind if I ask how long you’ve been hearing impaired?</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong></p><p>Since birth. I've always been hearing impaired.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>And I assume that impacted you through your childhood and at school?</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>Oh, yeah, absolutely, hugely. I went to a special ed school before kindergarten for hearing impaired and other handicapped kids. During school it was very rough because at the time, we had to use pairs of hearing aids hooked up to the teacher. Every class I would have to go up to the teacher with a big brown box with the hearing aids so she could use it. I always felt very humiliated by that, how it marked me out as different from other kids, not being able to hear.</p><p>The effects on socializing with other kids is terrible because you're always a second behind in conversation if you're trying to understand what the other person is saying. The hearing aids back then were pretty terrible. They've gotten a lot better but back then they were pretty terrible. You would always be behind. You'd always be feeling like the odd person out. Even if you could have been a wonderful conversationalist, you can't be if you're always a second behind and jumping in late. When you are hearing impaired, you understand acutely how quickly conversation moves. Milliseconds separate the moment between jumping in and everyone letting you talk, and someone else talking over you. That's just an awful experience if you're a kid who's already kind of introverted. It’s not like I was very extroverted as a kid, or now. So that was always a barrier.</p><p>Then you had a lot of minor distortions. I still have a weird fear of rain and water because it was drilled into me that I could not get the hearing aids wet because they were very expensive. I would always feel a kind of low-grade, stressful anxiety around anywhere like a pool, a body of water. Even now, I always feel weird about swimming, which I kind of enjoy. But I'm always thinking to myself, “Oh, wow, I won't be able to see because I'm nearsighted and I won't be able to hear because I had to take off my hearing aid to go in. I can't hear anything that anyone says to me in the pool, which takes a lot of the fun out of it.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>You have a list of open questions on your website and one of them is, “Why do the biographies of so many great people start off with traumatic childhoods?” I wonder if you have an answer for yourself. Was there something about the effect that hearing impairment had on your childhood, your inability to socialize, that was somehow important to you becoming Gwern?</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>It definitely led to me being so much of a bookworm. That's one of the things you can do as a kid which is completely unaffected by any kind of hearing impairment. It was also just a way to get words and language. Even now, I still often speak words in an incorrect way because I only learned them from books. It's the classic thing where you mispronounce a word because you learn it from a book and not from hearing other people sound it out and say it.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong></p><p>Is your speech connected to your hearing impairment?</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Yes. The deaf accent is from the hearing impairment. It's funny, at least three people on this trip to SF have already asked me where I am </span><em>really</em><span> from. It's very funny. You look at me and you’re like, “Oh, yes, he looks like a perfectly ordinary American.” Then I open my mouth and it’s, “Oh, gosh, he's Swedish. Wow. Or maybe possibly Norwegian. I'll ask him where he's actually from. How did he come to America?”</span></p><p>I've been here the whole time! That's just how hearing impaired people sound. No matter how fluent you get, you still bear the scars of growing up hearing impaired. At least when you're born with it—or from very early childhood—your cognitive development of hearing and speech is always a little off, even with therapy.&nbsp;</p><p>One reason I don't like doing podcasts is that I have no confidence that I sound good, or at least, sound nearly as good as I write. Maybe I'll put it that way.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong></p><p>What were you doing with all these rabbit holes before you started blogging? Was there a place where you would compile them?</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong></p><p>Before I started blogging, I was editing Wikipedia.&nbsp;</p><p><span>That was really </span><a href="http://gwern.net/" rel="">gwern.net</a><span> before </span><a href="http://gwern.net/" rel="">gwern.net</a><span>. Everything I do now with my site, I would have done on English Wikipedia. If you go and read some of the articles I am still very proud of—like the Wikipedia article on </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujiwara_no_Teika" rel="">Fujiwara no Teika</a><span>—and you would think pretty quickly to yourself, “Ah yes, Gwern wrote this, didn't he?”</span></p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong></p><p><span>Is it fair to say that the training that required to make </span><a href="http://gwern.net/" rel="">gwern.net</a><span> happened on Wikipedia?</span></p><p><strong>Gwern</strong></p><p>Yeah. I think so. I have learned far more from editing Wikipedia than I learned from any of my school or college training. Everything I learned about writing I learned by editing Wikipedia.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong></p><p>Honestly, it sounds like Wikipedia is a great training ground if you wanted to make a thousand more Gwerns. This is where we train them.</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong></p><p>Building something like an alternative to Wikipedia could be a good training ground. For me it was beneficial to combine rabbit-holing with Wikipedia, because Wikipedia would generally not have many good articles on the thing that I was rabbit-holing on.&nbsp;</p><p>It was a very natural progression from the relatively passive experience of rabbit-holing—where you just read everything you can about a topic—to compiling that and synthesizing it on Wikipedia. You go from piecemeal, a little bit here and there, to writing full articles. Once you are able to write good full Wikipedia articles and summarize all your work, now you can go off on your own and pursue entirely different kinds of writing now that you have learned to complete things and get them across the finish line.</p><p>It would be difficult to do that with the current English Wikipedia. It's objectively just a much larger Wikipedia than it was back in like 2004. But not only are there far more articles filled in at this point, the editing community is also much more hostile to content contribution, particularly very detailed, obsessive, rabbit hole-y kind of research projects. They would just delete it or tell you that this is not for original research or that you're not using approved sources. Possibly you’d have someone who just decided to get their jollies that day by deleting large swathes of your specific articles. That of course is going to make you very angry and make you probably want to quit and leave before you get going.&nbsp;</p><p>So I don't quite know how you would figure out this alternative to Wikipedia, one that empowers the rabbit holer as much as the old Wikipedia did.&nbsp;</p><p>When you are an editor with Wikipedia, you have a very empowered attitude because you know that anything in it could be wrong and you could be the one to fix it. If you see something that doesn't make sense to you, that could be an opportunity for an edit.&nbsp;</p><p>That was, at least, the Wiki attitude: anyone could fix it, and “anyone” includes you.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong></p><p>When you were an editor on Wikipedia, was that your full-time occupation?</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong></p><p>It would eat as much time as I let it. I could easily spend 8 hours a day reviewing edits and improving articles while I was rabbit-holing. But otherwise I would just neglect it and only review the most suspicious diffs on articles that I was particularly interested in on my watchlist. I might only spend like 20 minutes a day. It was sort of like going through morning email.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong></p><p>Was this while you were at university or after?</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong></p><p>I got started on Wikipedia in late middle school or possibly early high school.&nbsp;</p><p><span>It was kind of funny. I started skipping lunch in the cafeteria and just going to the computer lab in the library and alternating between </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neopets" rel="">Neopets</a><span> and Wikipedia. I had Neopets in one tab and my Wikipedia watch lists in the other.</span></p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong></p><p>Were there other kids in middle school or high school who were into this kind of stuff?</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong></p><p>No, I think I was the only editor there, except for the occasional jerks who would vandalize Wikipedia. I would know that because I would check the IP to see what edits were coming from the school library IP addresses. Kids being kids thought they would be jerks and vandalize Wikipedia.&nbsp;</p><p>For a while it was kind of trendy. Early on, Wikipedia was breaking through to mass awareness and controversy. It’s like the way LLMs are now. A teacher might say, “My student keeps reading Wikipedia and relying on it. How can it be trusted?”&nbsp;</p><p>So in that period, it was kind of trendy to vandalize Wikipedia and show your friends. There were other Wikipedia editors at my school in that sense, but as far as I knew I was the only one building it, rather than wrecking it.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong></p><p><span>When did you start blogging on </span><a href="http://gwern.net/" rel="">gwern.net</a><span>? I assume this was after the Wikipedia editor phase. Was that after university?</span></p><p><strong>Gwern</strong></p><p><span>It was afterwards. I had graduated and the Wikipedia community had been very slowly moving in a direction I did not like. It was triggered by the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_Seigenthaler_biography_incident" rel="">Siegenthaler incident</a><span> which I feel was really the defining moment in the trend toward </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletionism_and_inclusionism_in_Wikipedia" rel="">deletionism</a><span> on Wikipedia. It just became ever more obvious that Wikipedia was not the site I had joined and loved to edit and rabbit hole on and fill in, and that if I continued contributing I was often just wasting my effort.</span></p><p>I began thinking about writing more on my own account and moving into non-Wikipedia sorts of writings: persuasive essays, nonfiction, commenting, or possibly even fiction. I began gently moving beyond things like Reddit and LessWrong comments to start something longform.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong></p><p>What was your first big hit?</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong></p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_(marketplace)" rel="">Silk Road</a><span>. I had been a little bit interested in Bitcoin, but not too seriously interested in it because it was not obvious to me that it was going to work out, or even was technologically feasible. But when Adrian Chen wrote </span><a href="https://www.gawkerarchives.com/the-underground-website-where-you-can-buy-any-drug-imag-30818160" rel="">his </a><em><a href="https://www.gawkerarchives.com/the-underground-website-where-you-can-buy-any-drug-imag-30818160" rel="">Gawker</a></em><a href="https://www.gawkerarchives.com/the-underground-website-where-you-can-buy-any-drug-imag-30818160" rel=""> article about buying LSD off Silk Road</a><span>, all of a sudden I did a complete 180. I had this moment of, “Holy shit, this is so real that you can buy drugs off the Internet with it!”</span></p><p>I looked into the Chen article and it was very obvious to me that people wanted to know what the ordering process was like. They wanted more details about what it’s like, because the article was very brief about that. It didn't go into any real detail about the process.&nbsp;</p><p><span>So I thought, “Okay, I'm interested in </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nootropic" rel="">nootropics</a><span>. I'm interested in drugs. I will go and use Silk Road. I will document it for everyone, instead of everyone pussyfooting around it online and saying, ‘Oh, a friend of mine ordered off Silk Road and it worked.’ None of that bullshit. I will just document it straightforwardly.”</span></p><p><span>I ordered some Adderall, I think it was, and documented the entire process with screenshots. I </span><a href="https://gwern.obormot.net/silk-road" rel="">wrote it up</a><span> and wrote some more on the intellectual background. That was a huge hit when I published it. It was hundreds of thousands of hits. It's crazy. Even today when I go to the Google Analytics charts, you can still see “Silk Road” spiking vertically like crazy and then falling back down. Nothing else really comes near it in terms of traffic. That was really quite something, to see things go viral like that.</span></p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>What are the counterfactual career trajectories and life paths that could have been for you if you didn’t become an online writer? What might you be doing instead that seems plausible?</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>I could definitely have been an AI researcher, or possibly in management at one of the big AI companies. I would have regretted not being able to write about stuff, but I would’ve taken satisfaction in making it happen and putting my thumbprint on it. Those are totally plausible counterfactuals.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong></p><p>Why didn't you?</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>I kind of fell off that track very early on in my career when I found the curriculum of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)" rel="">Java</a><span> to be excruciatingly boring and painful. So I dropped out of computer science. That kind of put me off that track early on.</span></p><p><span>And then various early writing topics made it hard to transition in any other way than starting a startup, which I'm not really temperamentally suited for. Things like writing about the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darknet" rel="">darknet</a><span> markets or behavioral genetics, these are topics which don't exactly scream “great hire.”</span></p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong></p><p>Has agency turned out to be harder than you might have thought initially? We have models that seem like they should be able to do all of the individual things that a software engineer does. For example, all the code they might write, all the individual pull requests. But it seems like a really hard problem to get them to act as a coherent, autonomous, software engineer that puts in his eight hours a day.</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>I think agency is, in many senses, actually easier to learn than we would have thought ten years ago. But we actually aren't learning agency at all in current systems. There’s no selection for that. All the agency there is is an accidental byproduct of somebody training on data.&nbsp;</p><p>So from that perspective, it's miraculous that you can ask an LLM to try to do all these things and they have a non-trivial success rate. If you told people ten years ago—that you could just behavior-clone on individual letters following one by one, and you could get coherent action out of it and control robots and write entire programs—their jaws would drop and they would say that you've been huffing too many fumes from DeepMind or something.&nbsp;</p><p><span>The reason that agency doesn't work is that we do so little actual agency training at all. An example of how you would do agency directly would be like </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gato_(DeepMind)" rel="">Gato</a><span> from DeepMind. There they’re actually training agents. Instead we train them on Internet scrapes which merely encode the outputs of agents or occasional descriptions of agents doing things. There’s no actual logging of state/action/result/reward sequences like a proper reinforcement learning setup would have.&nbsp;</span></p><p>I would say that what's more interesting is that nobody wants to train agents in a proper reinforcement learning way. Instead, everyone wants to train LLMs and do everything with as little RL as possible in the backend.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>What would a person like you be doing before the Internet existed?</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>If the Internet did not exist, I would have to have tried to make it in regular academia and maybe narrow my interests a lot more, something I could publish on regularly.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Or I could possibly have tried to opt out and become a librarian like one of my favorite writers, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Luis_Borges" rel="">Jorge Luis Borges</a><span>. He was a librarian until he succeeded as a writer. Of course, I've always agreed with him about </span><a href="https://gwern.net/doc/borges/1977-borges-blindness.pdf#page=3" rel="">imagining paradise as a kind of library</a><span>. I love libraries.&nbsp;</span></p><p>I regret that all the reading I do is now on the computer and I don't get to spend much time in physical libraries. I do genuinely love them, just pouring through the stacks and looking for random stuff. Some of the best times for me in university was being able to go through these gigantic stacks of all sorts of obscure books and just looking at a random spine, pulling stuff off the shelf and reading obscure, old technical journals to see all the strange and wonderful things they were doing back then, which now have been forgotten.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>If you could ask Borges one question, what would it be?</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>Oh. He's a real hero of mine. This is not something I want to give a bad answer to.</p><p>[“Would it have been worth living if you could never write, only read, like the people in ‘The Library of Babel’?”]</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>Can I ask why he's a hero of yours?</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>When I was younger, one of the science fiction books that really impressed me was </span><a href="https://amzn.to/3BvmQuL" rel="">Dan Simmons' </a><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3BvmQuL" rel="">Hyperion</a></em><span>, especially </span><em><a href="https://amzn.to/4dEbtht" rel="">The Fall of Hyperion</a></em><span>.

I just read through them again and again.&nbsp;</span></p><p>I was blown away by the fact that you could be so creative, with all this polymathic knowledge and erudition, and write these wonderful, entertaining, provocative short stories and essays. I thought to myself, “If I could be like any writer, any writer at all, I would not mind being Borges.”</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Borges has a short poem called </span><a href="https://www.amherstlecture.org/perry2007/Borges%20and%20I.pdf" rel="">"Borges and I"</a><span> where he talks about how he doesn’t identify with the version of himself that is actually doing the writing and publishing all of this great work.

It’s the same plot as </span><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrival_(film)" rel="">Arrival</a></em><span>.</span></p><p><strong>Gwern</strong></p><p>They had a weird language which didn't have a sense of time. The narrator learned to see the future, and then the aliens left.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong></p><p>What is it that you realized about that story?</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>The first time I read it, it struck me as just a kind of stupid ESP story about seeing the future, very stupid, boring, standard conventional, verbose, and dragging in much irrelevant physics. Only a while after that did I understand that it was not about time travel or being able to see the future.</p><p>It was instead about a totally alien kind of mind that’s equally valid in its own way, in which you see everything as part of an already determined story heading to a predestined end. This turned out to be mathematically equivalent and equally powerful as our conventional view of the world—events marching one by one to an unknown and changing future.&nbsp;</p><p>That was a case where Chiang was just writing at too high a level for me to understand. I pattern-matched it to some much more common, stupid story.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong></p><p>How do you think about the value of reading fiction versus nonfiction?</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>You could definitely spend the rest of your life reading fiction and not benefit whatsoever from it other than having memorized a lot of trivia about things that people made up.&nbsp;</p><p>I tend to be pretty cynical about the benefits of fiction. Most fiction is not written to make you better in any way. It's written just to entertain you, or to exist and to fill up time.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>But it sounds like your own ideas have benefited a lot from the sci-fi that you read.</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Yeah, but it’s extremely little sci-fi. Easily 99% of the sci-fi I read was completely useless to me. I could have easily cut it down to 20 novels or short stories which actually were good enough and insightful enough to actually change my view. One volume of </span><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3BCejX8" rel="">Blindsight</a></em><span> by </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Watts_(author)" rel="">Peter Watts</a><span> is worth all hundred </span><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanth" rel="">Xanth</a></em><span> novels, or all 500 </span><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Legends" rel="">Expanded Universe</a><span> novels of </span><em>Star Wars</em><span>.</span></p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>The ones that you did find insightful, the top 20 or so, what did they have in common?</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong></p><p>I would say that the characteristic they have is taking non-human intelligence seriously.&nbsp;</p><p>It doesn't have to be artificial intelligence necessarily. It’s taking the idea of non-human intelligence seriously and not imagining your classic sci-fi scenario of humans going out into the galaxy with rayguns—the sort of thing where you have rockets and rayguns but you don't have cell phones.&nbsp;</p><p>People complain that the Singularity is a sort of boring, overused sci-fi trope. But if you went out and actually grabbed random books of science fiction, you would find that less than 1% contain anything remotely like that, or have any kind of relevance to the current context that we actually face with AI.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong></p><p>Do people tend to underestimate or overestimate your intelligence?</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong></p><p>I would say they overestimate it. They mistake for intelligence the fact that I remember many things, that I have written many things over many years. They imagine that if they sat me down, I could do it all spontaneously at the moment that they’re talking to me. But with many things I have thought about, I have the advantage of having looked at things before. So I’m cheating. When I talk to people, I may just be quoting something I've already written, or at least thought about.</p><p>So I come off as a lot smarter than I actually am. I would say I'm not really all that smart, compared to many people I've known, who update very fast on the fly. But in the end, it's the output that matters, right?</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong></p><p>I guess there is an on-the-fly intelligence. But there's another kind too which is this ability to synthesize things over a long period of time, and then come up with grand theories as a result of these different things that you’re seeing. I don’t think that’s just crystallized intelligence, right?</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong></p><p>It's not just crystallized intelligence, but if you could see all the individual steps in my process, you'd be a lot less impressed. If you could see all of the times I just note down something like, “Hmm, that's funny.” Or, "Huh, another example of that," and if you just saw each particular step, you would say that what I was doing was reasonable and not some huge sign of brilliance. It would make sense to you in that moment. It's only when that happens over a decade, and you don't see the individual stuff, that my output at the end looks like magic.</p><p><span>One of my favorite quotes about this process is from the magicians </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penn_%26_Teller" rel="">Penn &amp; Teller</a><span>. Teller says “magic is putting in more effort than any reasonable person would expect you to.” </span><a href="https://archive.ph/FuYXW" rel="">He tells a story</a><span> about how they make cockroaches appear from a top hat. The trick is that they researched and found special cockroaches, and then found special styrofoam to trap the cockroaches, and arranged all that, for just a single trick. No </span><em>reasonable</em><span> person would do that, but they did because they wanted the trick to really pay off. The result is cockroaches somehow appearing from an empty hat.&nbsp;</span></p><p>If you could see each step, it would make sense on its own, it would just look effortful. But when you see only the final trick, then that whole process and its output becomes magic.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>That’s one of the interesting things about your process. There are a couple of writers like </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/authors/ARbTQlRLRjE/matthew-s-levine" rel="">Matt Levine</a><span> or </span><a href="https://www.thediff.co/" rel="">Byrne Hobart</a><span> who write an article every day. I think of them almost like autoregressive models. For you, on some of the blog posts you can see the start date and end date that you list on your website of when you’ve been working on a piece. Sometimes it’s like 2009 to 2024. I feel like that’s much more like </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_model" rel="">diffusion</a><span>. You just keep iterating on the same image again and again.</span></p><p><span>One of my favorite blog posts of yours is </span><a href="https://gwern.net/backstop" rel="">“Evolution as Backstop for RL,”</a><span> where you talk about evolution as basically a mechanism to learn a better learning process. And that explains why corporations don’t improve over time but biological organisms do. I’m curious if you can walk me through the years that it took to write that. What was that process like, step by step?</span></p><p><strong>Gwern</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>So the “Backstop” essay that you're referring to is the synthesis of seeing the same pattern show up again and again: a stupid, inefficient way of learning, which you use to learn something smarter, but where you still can’t get rid of the original one entirely.</p><p>Sometimes examples would just connect to each other when I was thinking about this. Other times —when I started watching for this pattern—I would say, "Oh yes, ‘pain’ is a good example of this. Maybe this explains why we have pain in the very specific way that we have, when you can logically imagine other kinds of pain, and those other pains would be smarter, but nothing keeps them honest.”</p><p><span>So you just chain them one by one, these individual examples of the pattern, and just keep clarifying the central idea as you go. </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Wittgenstein" rel="">Wittgenstein</a><span> says that you can look at an idea from many directions and then go in spirals around it. In an essay like “Backstop,” it’s me spiraling around this idea of having many layers of “learning” all the way down.</span></p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>Once you notice one example of this pattern, like this pain example, do you just keep adding examples to that? Walk me through the process over time.</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>For that specific essay, the first versions were about corporations not evolving. Then, as I read more and more of the meta reinforcement learning literature, from DeepMind especially, I added in material about neural networks. I kept reading and thinking about the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mind" rel="">philosophy of mind</a><span> papers that I had read. I eventually nailed down the idea that pain might be another instance of this: “Pain makes us learn. We can’t get rid of it, because we need it to keep us honest.” At that point you have more or less the structure of the current essay.</span></p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong></p><p>Are there examples where it’s not a matter of accumulating different instances of what you later realize is one bigger pattern? Rather, you just have to have the full thesis at once.</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong></p><p>For those essays where there is an individual eureka moment, there's usually a bunch of disparate things that I have been making notes on that I don't even realize are connected. They just bother me for a long time. They sit there bothering me. I keep looking for explanations for each one and not finding them. It keeps bothering me and bothering me.&nbsp;</p><p><span>One day, I hit something that suddenly makes me go, “Bam, eureka. These are all connected!” Then I just </span><a href="https://gwern.net/about#my-experience-of-writing" rel="">have to sit down and write</a><span> a single gigantic essay that pours out about it and then it's done. That particular essay will be done at that point—right in one go. I might add in many links to it or references later on, but it will not fundamentally change.</span></p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong></p><p>What's an example of an essay that had this process?</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong></p><p><span>Someone asked about how I came up with one yesterday, as a matter of fact. It’s one of my oldest essays, </span><a href="https://gwern.net/subculture" rel="">“The Melancholy of Subculture Society.”</a><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>For that one, I had been reading miscellaneous things like </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Foster_Wallace" rel="">David Foster Wallace</a><span> </span><a href="https://amzn.to/3XYy9mR" rel="">on tennis</a><span>, people on Internet media like video games. One day it just hit me: it's incredibly sad that we have all these subcultures and tribes online that can find community together, but they are still incredibly isolated from the larger society. One day, a flash just hit me about how beautiful and yet also sad this is.&nbsp;</span></p><p>I sat down and wrote down the entire thing more or less. I've not really changed it all that much. I've added more links and quotes and examples over time, but nothing important. The essence was just a flash and I wrote it down while it was there.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong></p><p><span>One of the interesting quotes you have in the essay is from David Foster Wallace when he’s talkinag about the tennis player </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Joyce_(tennis)" rel="">Michael Joyce</a><span>. He’s talking about </span><a href="https://archive.ph/yoKrc" rel="">the sacrifices Michael Joyce has had to make</a><span> in order to be top ten in the world at tennis. He’s functionally illiterate because he’s been playing tennis every single day since he was seven or something, and not really having any life outside of tennis.</span></p><p>What are the Michael Joyce-type sacrifices that you have had to make to be Gwern?</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong></p><p><span>That's a hard hitting question, Dwarkesh! “How have I amputated my life in order to write?”... I think I've amputated my life in many respects professionally and personally, especially in terms of travel. There are many people I envy for their ability to travel and socialize, or for their power and their positions in places like </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic" rel="">Anthropic</a><span> where they are the insiders. I have sacrificed whatever career I could have had, or whatever fun lifestyle: a digital nomad lifestyle and going outdoors, being a Buddhist monk, or maybe a fancy trader. All those have had to be sacrificed for the patient work of sitting down every day and reading papers until my eyes bleed, and hoping that something good comes out of it someday.</span></p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong></p><p><span>Why does it feel like there's a trade off between the two? There are obviously many writers who travel a lot like </span><a href="https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/tyler-cowen-2" rel="">Tyler Cowen</a><span>. There are writers who have a lot of influence such as </span><a href="https://jack-clark.net/about/" rel="">Jack Clark</a><span> at Anthropic. Why does it feel like you can’t do both at the same time?</span></p><p><strong>Gwern</strong></p><p>I can't be or be compared to Tyler Cowen. Tyler Cowen is a one-man industry.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong></p><p>So is Gwern.</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong></p><p>Yeah, but he cannot be replicated. I just cannot be Tyler Cowen. Jack Clark, he is also his own thing. He's able to write the stories in his issues very well while also being a policy person. I respect them and admire them.&nbsp;</p><p>But none of those quite hit my particular interest and niche at following weird topics for a long period of time, and then collating and sorting through information. That requires a large commitment to reading vast masses of things in the hopes that some tiny detail perhaps will turn out to one day be important.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong></p><p>So walk me through this process. You talked about reading papers until your eyes bleed at the end of the day. You wake up in the morning and you go straight to the papers? What does your day look like?</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong></p><p>The workflow right now is more like: I wake up, I do normal morning things, and then I clean up the previous day's work on the website. I deal with various issues, like formatting or spelling errors. I review it and think if I properly collated everything and put it in the right places. Sometimes I might have an extra thought that I need to add in or make a comment that I realize was important. That's the first step.</p><p>After that, I often will shamelessly go to Twitter or my RSS feed and just read a large amount until perhaps I get distracted by a comment or a question from someone and maybe do some writing on that.</p><p>After that, I take a break for lunch or whatever, and then go back to that and just keep going at it. Somewhere around evening, I will often get exhausted from all that, and try to do a real project or contribution to something. I’ll actually sit down and work on whatever I'm supposed to be working on that day.</p><p>After that, I would typically go to the gym. By that point, I really am burned out from everything. Yes, I like going to the gym—not because I'm any kind of meathead or athlete or even really enjoy weightlifting—but because it's the most diametrically opposite thing I can do to sitting in front of a computer.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong></p><p><span>This is </span><a href="https://gwern.net/backstop#burnout" rel="">your theory of burnout</a><span>, right? That you have to do the exact opposite?</span></p><p><strong>Gwern</strong></p><p>Yes, when people experience burnout, you just feel a lack of reward for what you're doing or what you’re working on. You just need to do something different. Something as different as possible. Maybe you could do better than weightlifting, but it does feel very different from anything I do in front of a computer.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong></p><p>I want to go back to your process. Everyday, you’re loading up all this context. You’re reading all the RSS feeds and all these papers. Are you basically making contributions to all your essays, adding a little bit here and there every single day? Or are you building up some potential which will manifest itself later on as a full essay, a fully formed thesis?</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong></p><p>I would say it’s the latter one. All the minor low-level additions and pruning and fixing I do is really not that important. It's more just a way to make nicer essays. It’s a purely aesthetic goal, to make as nice an essay as I possibly can. I'm really waiting to see what happens next. What will be the next thing I'll be provoked to write about? It's just passing the time in between sudden eruptions.</p><p>I feel that for many writers, you can't neglect the gardening process. You don't harvest every day. You have to tend the garden for a long time in between harvests. If you start to neglect the gardening because you're gallivanting around the world… Let's say you're going to book signing events and doing all the publicity stuff. Then you're not doing the work of being in there and tending your garden. That's undermining your future harvest, even if you can't see it right now.</p><p>If you ask what is Tyler Cowen's secret to being Tyler Cowen, my guess would be that he's just really good at tending his garden, even as he travels a crazy amount. That would be his secret, that he's able to read books on a plane. I can't read books on a plane. He's able to write everything in the airport. I can do a little bit of writing in the airport but not very much. He's just very robust to the wear and tear of traveling. I'll be collapsing in the hotel room after talking to people for eight hours. He's able to talk to people for eight hours and then go do podcasts and talk to someone for another four hours! That's extremely admirable, but I just can't do that.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>How often do you get bored? It sounds like you’re spending your whole day reading different things. Are they all just inherently interesting to you? Or do you just trudge through it even when it’s not compelling to you in the moment?</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>I don't think I get bored too easily because I switch between so many different topics. Even if I'm kind of sick of deep learning papers, well, I have tons of other things I can read or argue with people about. So I don't really get bored. I just get exhausted. I have to go off and do something else, like lift weights.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong></p><p>What is your most unusual but successful work habit?</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong></p><p><span>I think I get </span><a href="https://gwern.net/doc/science/1986-hamming#anger-negativity-and-self-delusion" rel="">a lot more mileage</a><span> out of arguing with people online than… pretty much any other writer does. [Patel laughs] Hey, I'm trying to give a genuine answer here, not some stupid thing about note-taking—a real answer!</span></p><p><span>I get a lot more out of arguing with people than most people do. You need motivation to write and actually sit down, and </span><a href="https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/your-book-review-silver-age-marvel/comment/65693964" rel="">crystallize something</a><span> and do the harvest. After you tend your garden, you do have to do the harvest, and the harvest can be hard work. It's very tedious.&nbsp;</span></p><p>There are many people I talk to who have many great ideas. But they don't want to harvest because it's tedious and boring. And it's very hot out there in the fields, reaping. You're getting dusty and sweaty. Why wouldn't you just be inside having lemonade?</p><p>But motivation from arguing and being angry at people online is in plentiful supply. So I get a lot of mileage out of people being wrong on the Internet.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong></p><p>What are the pitfalls of an isolated working process?</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong></p><p>There’s the obvious one: you could be arbitrarily wrong when writing by yourself and just become a crazy loony by having a ‘big take’.&nbsp;</p><p>Aside from that, you also have the issue of the emotional toll of not having colleagues that you can convince. You often just have the experience of shouting onto the internet that continues to be wrong despite your shouting.</p><p>One thing I observe is that very often independent writers are overcome by resentment and anger and disappointment. They sort of spiral out into bitterness and crankdom from there. That's kind of what kills them. They could have continued if they’d only been able to let go of the ideas and arguments and move on to the next topic.</p><p>So I say that ‘spite can be a great motivation to write, but you have to use it skillfully and let it go afterwards’. You can only have it while you need motivation to write. If you keep going and hold on to it, you're poisoning yourself.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong></p><p><span>I'm sure you're aware that many people comment on the fact that ‘if Gwern put the effort he spends </span><a href="https://gwern.net/design" rel="">optimizing the CSS on his website</a><span> towards more projects and more writing, the benefits to society could be measured in the nearest million dollars’. What's your reaction to people who say you're spending too much time on site design?</span></p><p><strong>Gwern</strong></p><p>I have no defense at all there in terms of objective benefits to society. I do it because I'm selfish and I like it. That is my defense. I like the aesthetics of my website and it is a hobby.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong></p><p>Does the design help you think?</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong></p><p><span>It does because I like rereading my stuff more when I can appreciate the aesthetics of it and the beauty of the website. It’s easier for me to tolerate reading something for the hundredth time when I would otherwise be sick to death of it. Site maintenance for the author is inherently this kind of </span><a href="https://gwern.net/spaced-repetition" rel="">spaced repetition</a><span>. If I go over pages to check that some new formatting feature worked, I am getting spaced repetition there. More than once, I’ve gone to check some stupid CSS issue and looked at something and thought, “Oh, I should change something,” or, “Oh, </span><em>that</em><span> means something.”</span></p><p>So in a way, it's not as much of a waste as it looks, but I can't defend it entirely. If someone wants to make their own website, they should not invest that much for the aesthetic value.&nbsp;</p><p>I just want a really nice website. There's so many bad websites out there that it depresses me. There's at least one website I love.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>By the way, I’m going to mention this since you never mentioned it yourself. But I think the main way you fund your research is through </span><a href="https://www.patreon.com/gwern" rel="">your Patreon</a><span>, right? You never advertise it but I feel—with the kind of thing you’re doing—if it were financially viable and got adequate funding, not only would you be able to keep doing it but other people who wanted to be independent researchers could see it’s a thing you can do. It’s a viable thing you can do. More Gwerns would exist.</span></p><p><strong>Gwern</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>Well, I don't necessarily want more Gwerns to exist. I just want more writers and more activeness and more agency in general.&nbsp;</p><p>I would be perfectly happy if someone simply wrote more Reddit comments and never took a dollar for their writings and just wrote better Reddit comments. I'd be perfectly happy if someone had a blog and they kept writing, but they just put a little more thought into the design. I'd be perfectly happy if no one ever wrote something, but they hosted PDFs so that links didn't rot.</p><p>&nbsp;In general, you don't have to be a writer delivering longform essays. That's just one of many ways to write. It happened to be the one that I personally kind of prefer. But it'd be totally valid to be a Twitter thread writer.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong></p><p>How do you sustain yourself while writing full time?</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong></p><p><span>Patreon and savings. I have a </span><a href="https://www.patreon.com/gwern" rel="">Patreon</a><span> which does around $900-$1000/month, and then I cover the rest with my savings. I got lucky with having some early Bitcoins and made enough to write for a long time, but not forever. So I try to spend as little as possible to make it last.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>I should probably advertise the </span><a href="https://www.patreon.com/gwern" rel="">Patreon</a><span> more, but I'm too proud to shill it harder.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>It's also awkward trying to come up with some good rewards which don't entail a paywall. Patreon and Substack work well for a lot of people like </span><a href="https://www.astralcodexten.com/about" rel="">Scott Alexander</a><span>, because they like writing regular newsletter-style updates but I don't like to. I just let it run and hope it works.</span></p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>Wait if you’re doing $900-1000/month and you’re sustaining yourself on that, that must mean you’re sustaining yourself on less than $12,000 a year. What is your lifestyle like at $12K?</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>I live in the middle of nowhere. I don't travel much, or eat out, or have health insurance, or anything like that. I cook my own food. I use a free gym. There was this time when the floor of my bedroom began collapsing. It was so old that the humidity had decayed the wood. We just got a bunch of scrap wood and a joist and propped it up. If it lets in some bugs, oh well! I live like a grad student, but with better ramen. I don't mind it much since I spend all my time reading anyway.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong></p><p>It's still surprising to me that you can make rent, take care of your cat, deal with any emergencies, all of that on $12K a year.</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>I'm lucky enough to be in excellent health and to have had no real emergencies to date. This can't last forever, and so it won't. I'm definitely not trying to claim that this is any kind of ideal lifestyle, or that anyone else could or should try to replicate my approach! I got lucky with Bitcoin and with being satisfied with living like a monk and with my health.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyone who would like to take up a career as a writer or blogger should understand that this is not an example they can imitate. I’m not trying to be a role model.&nbsp;</p><p>Every writer will have to figure it out a different way. Maybe it can be something like a Substack, or just writing on the side while slinging Javascript for a tech company. I don’t know.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>It seems like you’ve enjoyed this recent trip to San Francisco? What would it take to get you to move here?</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>Yeah, it is mostly just money stopping me at this point. I probably should bite the bullet and move anyway. But I'm a miser at heart and I hate thinking of how many months of writing runway I'd have to give up for each month in San Francisco.&nbsp;</p><p>If someone wanted to give me, I don’t know, $50–100K/year to move to SF and continue writing full-time like I do now, I'd take it in a heartbeat. Until then, I'm still trying to psych myself up into a move.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>That sounds very doable. If somebody did want to contribute to making this move, and your research more generally, possible, how would they get in touch with you?</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>I have </span><a href="https://donate.stripe.com/6oE9DTgaf6oD0M03cc" rel="">a Stripe donation page</a><span>, or they could just email me at </span><a href="mailto:gwern@gwern.net" rel="">gwern@gwern.net</a><span>.</span></p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong></p><p>By when will AI models be more diverse than the human population?</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong></p><p>I'm going to say that if you exclude capability from that, AI models are already much more diverse cognitively than humans are.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Different LLMs think in very distinct ways that you can tell right away from a sample of them. An LLM operates nothing like a GAN. A GAN also is totally different from </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variational_autoencoder" rel="">VAEs</a><span>. They have totally different latent spaces, especially in the lower end, where they’re small or bad models. They have wildly different artifacts and errors in a way that we would not see with humans.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Humans are really very quite similar in writing and attitude compared to these absurd outputs of different kinds of models.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Really? If you look at </span><a href="https://lmarena.ai/" rel="">Chatbot Arena</a><span> and you see side-by-side comparisons of the outputs of different models, it's often very hard to tell which ones comes from which model.</span></p><p><strong>Gwern</strong></p><p><span>Yeah but this is all </span><a href="https://gwern.net/doc/reinforcement-learning/preference-learning/mode-collapse/index" rel="">very heavily tuned</a><span>. Now you're restricting it to relatively recent LLMs, with everyone riding each other's coattails and often training on the same exact data. This is a situation much closer to if they were identical twins.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>If I don't restrict myself to just LLMs and I compare the wide diversity of say </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-to-image_model" rel="">image generation models</a><span>, they often have totally different ways. Some of them seem as similar to each other as ants do to beavers.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Within LLMs, I would agree that there has been a massive loss of diversity. Things used to be way more diverse among LLMs. But across deep learning in general, we’ve seen a whole range of minds and ways to think that you won't find in any philosophy of mind paper.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>What's an example of two models that have these sorts of cognitive differences?</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>I’ll give one example I was telling someone the other day. GAN models have </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11626" rel="">incentives to hide things</a><span> because it's an adversarial loss, whereas diffusion models have no such thing. So GAN models are ‘scared’. They </span><a href="https://gwern.net/crop#fn5" rel="">put ‘hands’ off the screen</a><span>. They just can't think about hands. Whereas diffusion models think about hands, but in their gigantic, monstrous, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cthulhu" rel="">Cthulhu</a><span>-esque abortions.</span></p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>People weren't paying attention to scaling in 2020. Is there some trend today where people aren’t really comprehending the full implications of where this is headed?</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong></p><p><span>I'm excited by the weight-loss drugs, the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLP-1_receptor_agonist" rel="">GLP drugs</a><span>. Their effects in general on </span><a href="https://gwern.net/doc/longevity/glp/psychology/index" rel="">health and addiction </a><span>across all sorts of behaviors really surprised me. No one predicted that as far as I know. While the results are still very preliminary, it does seem like it's real.&nbsp;</span></p><p>I think that’s going to tell us something important about human willpower and dysfunctionality. What's going wrong broadly in the modern environment?</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Do GLP drugs break the Algernon argument—</span><a href="https://gwern.net/drug-heuristic#:~:text=That%20intelligence%20(g%E2%81%A0)%20in,)%2C%20so%20why%20not%20intelligence%3F" rel="">the one you listed in your blog post</a><span>—that if there are any simple and useful interventions without bad side effects, then evolution should have already found them?</span></p><p><strong>Gwern</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>It's too soon to say because we haven't actually figured out what's going on with the GLPs to even understand what they are doing at all, what has the off target. It's kind of crazy that activating and deactivating both work.&nbsp;</p><p>It's a completely crazy situation. I don't really know what to think about the Algernon argument there. It could be that the benefits actually decrease fitness in the fertility sense because you're going out and having a happy life instead of having kids. No offense to parents. Or it could just be that it's hitting the body in a way that's really, really hard to replicate in any kind of genetic way.&nbsp; Or it could be that it's just too soon.&nbsp;</p><p><span>When I think back, I see that the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity_in_the_United_States" rel="">obesity crisis</a><span> only became obvious around the 1990s. It's quite recent. I look back at photos and today is completely unrecognizable from 1990. You look at photos and people are still thin. You look at photos now and everyone is like a blimp. So you can't possibly have any kind of Algernon argument over 20 or 30 years.</span></p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>When you look back at the Romans and you see how </span><a href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/encyclopaedia_romana/wine/leadpoisoning.html" rel="">lead was constantly poisoning the entire city</a><span>, what credence do you give to the possibility that something in our environment is having an effect on us on a similar magnitude of what lead was doing to the ancient Romans?</span></p><p><strong>Gwern</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>I think the odds of there being something as bad as lead is almost 100%. We have so many things out there. Chemists are always cooking up new stuff. There are all sorts of things with microbiomes. Plastics are trendy, but maybe it's not plastics. Maybe it’s something else entirely. But there's almost no way that everything we have put out there is totally benign and safe and has no harmful effects at any concentration—that seems like a really strong claim to be making.&nbsp;</p><p><span>I don't believe in any particular one, but I do believe in like, “1% here, 1% here, 1% here.” There's something out there. There's something out there where we're going to look back at and say, “Oh, wow, those people were really poisoning themselves just like with </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetraethyllead" rel="">leaded gasoline</a><span>. If only they had known&nbsp; </span><em>x</em><span>, </span><em>y</em><span>, and</span><em> z</em><span>. It’s so obvious now!”</span></p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>Do you think this would manifest itself most likely in cognitive impairments or obesity or something else?</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>A priori, I would possibly expect intelligence to be the most fragile thing and most harmed by it. But when we look at the time series there, intelligence is pretty stable overall. So I have to say that whatever the harmful thing is, it’s probably not going to be on intelligence.&nbsp;</p><p>Whereas obesity is a much better candidate because you do see obesity go crazy over the last 30 years.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong></p><p><span>I was surprised to hear you say yesterday that you are skeptical of Bay Area-type experimentation with psychedelics. I sort of associate you very much with experimentation with different substances and seeing if they are helpful to you. I’m curious why you draw </span><a href="https://fs.blog/chestertons-fence/" rel="">Chesterton's fence</a><span> here when it comes to psychedelics.</span></p><p><strong>Gwern</strong></p><p>The cleanest way to divide that would just be to point out that the effects of psychedelics can be acute and permanent.&nbsp;</p><p>The things I was looking at are much more controlled in the sense that they are relatively manageable in effect. None of them affect your judgment permanently about whether to take more nootropics. Whereas something like LSD permanently changes how you see things such as taking LSD, or permanently changes your psychiatric state. There's a cumulative effect with psychedelics that you don't see much with nootropics, which makes nootropics inherently a heck of a lot safer and much more easy to quantify the effects of.</p><p>With nootropics, you don't see people spinning off into the crazy outcomes psychedelics have. They get crazier and crazier each time they take another dose, which makes them crazy enough to want to take another dose. Psychedelics have what you might call a “self-recommending problem” where they always make you want to take more of them. It’s similar to meditation. What is the most visible sign of having done a lot of meditation? It's that you seem compelled to tell people that they ought to meditate. This kind of spiral leads to bad outcomes for psychedelics that you just don't see with nootropics.</p><p>The standard failure case for nootropics is that you spent a few hundred or $1,000 and then you got no real benefit out of it. You went on with your life. You did some weird drugs for a while and that was all. That's not so bad. It's a weird way to get your entertainment... But in principle, it's not really all that worse than going to the movie theater for a while and spending $1,000 on movie theater tickets.</p><p>With psychedelics, you're changing yourself permanently, irrevocably in a way you don't understand and exposing yourself to all sorts of malicious outside influences: whatever happens to occur to you while you're very impressionable.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Okay, yeah, a few uses can be good. I have gotten good out of my few uses. But if you are doing it more than that, you should really have a hard look in the mirror about what benefit you </span><em>think</em><span> you are getting and how you are changing.</span></p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>People don’t know your voice. People don’t know your face. As a result, they have this interesting parasocial relationship with you. I wonder if you have a theory of what kind of role you fill in people’s life.</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>What role do I </span><em>actually</em><span> fill, or what role would I </span><em>want</em><span> to fill?</span></p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>Let's do both.</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The role I </span><em>want</em><span> to fill is actually sort of like how LLMs see me, oddly enough. If you play around with LLMs like Claude-3, a character named “Gwern” sometimes will show up. He plays the role of a mentor or old wizard, offering insight into the situation, and exhorting them with a </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey#The_Call_to_Adventure" rel="">call to adventure</a><span>. “</span><em>You too</em><span> can write stuff and </span><a href="https://milan.cvitkovic.net/writing/things_youre_allowed_to_do/" rel="">do stuff</a><span> and think stuff!”</span></p><p><span>I would like people to go away having not just been entertained or gotten some useful information, but be better people, in however slight a sense. To have an aspiration that web pages could be better, that the Internet could be better: “</span><em>You too</em><span> could go out and read stuff! </span><em>You too</em><span> could have your thoughts and compile your thoughts into essays, too! </span><em>You</em><span> could do all this!”</span></p><p><span>But I fear that the way it </span><em>actually</em><span> works for quite a few people is that I wind up as either a guru or trickster devil.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Depending on whether you like me or hate me, either I am the god of statistics &amp; referencing who can do no wrong—”Just take everything on the site as gospel!”, which I really dislike—or I'm just some sort of horrible, covert, malicious, neo-Nazi, eugenicist, totalitarian, communist, anti-Chinese devil figure lurking in the background trying to bring down Western society.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>Final question, what are the open rabbit holes you have—things you’re curious about but don't have an answer to—that you hope to have an answer to by 2050?</p><p><strong>Gwern</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>By 2050, I really hope we can finally answer some of the big questions about ourselves that have just reliably resisted definitive answers. A lot of them might not matter any more, but I'd still like to know.</p><p><span>Why do we sleep or dream? Why do humans age? Why </span><em>does</em><span> sexual reproduction exist? Why do humans differ so much, from each other and day to day? Why did humans take </span><em>so</em><span> long to develop technological civilization? Where are all the aliens? Why didn't </span><em>China</em><span> have the Industrial Revolution instead? How </span><em>should</em><span> we have predicted the deep learning revolution? Why are our brains </span><em>so</em><span> oversized compared to artificial neural networks?&nbsp;</span></p><p>Those are some of the questions that I really hope we’ve answered by 2050.</p><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong></p><p>Alright Gwern, this has been excellent. Thank you for coming on the podcast.</p></div></div>]]></description>

documentation<a href="#invested-heavily-in-documentation" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h3><p>Before I started my first business six years ago, I read the book <a href="https://builttosell.com/"><em>Built to Sell</em></a> by John Warrilow. It encourages founders to build businesses that run smoothly without the founder actively managing day-to-day activities. An effective company should have a set of well-defined processes and a team that knows how to execute them.</p><p>I’ve always loved reproducible processes, so when I started building the team for TinyPilot, I invested in documentation. Rather than train people in person or on video calls, I wrote playbooks in our Notion workspace. If we ran into issues with our playbooks, we’d revise them to reduce errors in the future. When new team members joined, they’d onboard via the same playbooks, and we’d continuously improve them.</p><p>After I sold TinyPilot, the contract called for a 30-day transition period, during which I would provide up to 80 hours of consulting time. The buyer only needed about 25 hours. The team already knew how to run the day-to-day of TinyPilot, and the buyer had access to all of our documentation. Most of my time post-transition was just introducing the new owner to the team and our key vendors.</p><h3 id="created-a-transition-checklist">Created a transition checklist<a href="#created-a-transition-checklist" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h3><p>As I prepared the company for sale, I started a checklist of everything I wanted to do before selling. It included things like deleting obsolete playbooks and ensuring that all of our account credentials were in the company Bitwarden account.</p><p>As we entered due diligence, I expanded this checklist to include things that would need to happen during the transition. I split the checklist into four categories:</p><ul><li>Things that must happen before closing</li><li>Things that must happen a day or two after closing</li><li>Things that should happen within the first week after closing</li><li>Things that should happen within the first month after closing</li></ul><p>The checklist turned out to be extremely valuable, especially the week of the closing. So many accounts were changing hands, and processes needed tweaking for the new owner, so it was helpful to have a checklist I created in calmer times.</p><h3 id="worked-with-a-broker-i-trusted">Worked with a broker I trusted<a href="#worked-with-a-broker-i-trusted" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h3><p>I used to have a negative view of M&amp;A brokers. When I thought “broker,” I imagined someone who just wanted to close deals as quickly as possible and didn’t care about anything else. I imagined them saying things like, “Let’s bottom line this,” or “Time for Jäger bombs!”</p><p>When I attended Microconf in 2023, I met Chris Guthrie, an advisor at <a href="https://quietlight.com/">Quiet Light Brokerage</a>. He immediately came across as laid-back, low-pressure, and founder-focused. He was a former founder, and he emphasized the importance of finding the best deal for the founder, not necessarily the quickest payout.</p><p>I appreciated working with Quiet Light because our incentives felt aligned throughout the process. The pool of bootstrapped founders looking for M&amp;A brokers is small and relatively tight-knit, so Quiet Light has natural pressure to maintain a positive reputation.</p><p>In discussions about the sale, some people <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40515107">balked</a> at Quiet Light’s $89k fee, as it represented 15% of the sale price. I still think that was a fair commission, as they found me a buyer I couldn’t have found on my own and kept the deal on track throughout the process.</p><h3 id="avoided-seller-financing">Avoided seller financing<a href="#avoided-seller-financing" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h3><p>I didn’t need cash desperately, so I was initially open to a buyer paying me in installments over several years. When I spoke to other founders, they warned me away from seller financing. As one founder put it:</p><blockquote><p>If you finance the purchase yourself, you now work for the buyer.</p></blockquote><p>I was puzzled. How does financing the sale mean I work for the buyer?</p><p>The founder explained that you don’t get paid unless the business makes money, and the new owner knows that. The new owner can push management responsibilities onto you, knowing that if the business fails, you can’t collect your debt.</p><p>The other risk of seller financing is that I, as a small lender, don’t have tools or experience to collect a loan if a buyer defaults. The buyer might decide they simply don’t feel like paying me even if they have the cash on hand. For a deal that’s under $1M, I’d probably spend more in legal fees than I could hope to collect from an unscrupulous buyer.</p><p>I would have been open to seller financing had there been no other options available, but it would be a red flag to me that the buyer couldn’t secure a loan from a bank. Further, I’d need to charge well above prevailing interest rates because my risk would be higher than a bank’s.</p><h3 id="assumed-id-get-nothing-after-closing">Assumed I’d get nothing after closing<a href="#assumed-id-get-nothing-after-closing" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h3><p>From talking to other founders about their exits, most people seemed disappointed with the payments they were supposed to receive after closing. In some cases, the buyer failed to honor the contract, but it was too small an amount to litigate. In other cases, the new owner used creative bookkeeping to avoid paying performance-based bonuses.</p><p>The advice I heard consistently was to structure the deal so that if I got nothing after closing, I’d still be happy. I should treat anything after closing as an unexpected bonus.</p><p>The buyer and I did send some money back and forth after closing to account for little costs that we forgot to include in the deal, and that went smoothly. These amounts were a tiny part of the overall transaction, less than $5k. Had the buyer refused to pay, I would have been frustrated, but it would have been easy to move on.</p><h3 id="recognized-the-limits-of-my-influence-on-the-business-post-close">Recognized the limits of my influence on the business post-close<a href="#recognized-the-limits-of-my-influence-on-the-business-post-close" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h3><p>One of the most important criteria for the sale was finding a new owner who wanted to continue investing in the product, the team, and our customers.</p><p>I asked other founders for advice on avoiding a buyer who’s out to gut the company and squeeze everything for short-term profits. Their advice was that I can’t control what the new owner does after closing, so I shouldn’t think about it.</p><p>It’s true that I can’t control how the new owner runs their business, but it’s possible to screen out risky buyers. For example, if a private equity company like Idera approached me, I’d notice that they have a history of buying companies and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19218036">laying off their staff</a>, so I’d have a good guess about their plans for TinyPilot.</p><p>I looked for buyers whose vision for the company aligned with mine, but I also recognized that my influence over the company ended on closing day.</p><p>The new owner runs the business his own way, but his approach matches what we discussed about his vision for the company. I didn’t guarantee this outcome, but I think screening buyers increased my odds to some degree.</p><h3 id="revised-the-broker-agreement-so-that-the-broker-gets-paid-when-i-get-paid">Revised the broker agreement so that the broker gets paid when I get paid<a href="#revised-the-broker-agreement-so-that-the-broker-gets-paid-when-i-get-paid" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h3><p>The first draft of Quiet Light’s broker agreement said that their fee is a percentage of the purchase price, and it’s due at closing.</p><p>The problem was that I, as the seller, may not receive the full purchase price at closing. I sign with the broker well before I know the terms of any deal they might find for me.</p><p>If the purchase agreement involved deferred payment, I’d have to pay Quiet Light upfront and wait several years until I received my full payout. Worse, if the buyer failed to make payment after closing, I’d have paid a broker commission on money I never received.</p><p>I requested that Quiet Light revise their broker agreement to say that they only get paid when I get paid, and they quickly agreed.</p><p>I was relieved that they were willing to adjust the contract, as the new payment terms kept incentives aligned between me and Quiet Light. They’d have just as much desire to push back against deferred payments as I would.</p><h3 id="discussed-contentious-issues-without-lawyers-first">Discussed contentious issues without lawyers first<a href="#discussed-contentious-issues-without-lawyers-first" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h3><p>The buyer’s attorney drafted the asset purchase agreement for the sale rather than using a pre-made template from the broker. For the most part, we agreed on the initial draft, but there were a few key terms where we had different expectations.</p><p>We could have each told our lawyers what we wanted and had them hash it out, but lawyers get expensive fast — mine was $550/hr.</p><p>Lawyers also slow down the process. The buyer and I could usually arrange to meet within one business day, whereas it would have taken a week to arrange a meeting with both of our lawyers. For a process that already felt long at three months, every day mattered.</p><p>When the buyer and I ran into disagreements in the contract, we’d first talk one-on-one. In these conversations, my goal was to go past the contract terms and find out the underlying need.</p><p>For example, the first draft of the contract called for tight restrictions on discussing the sale publicly. I spoke with the buyer about why the clause was there, and it turned out that there were only a few things the buyer cared about keeping private. We adjusted the wording from “you can’t discuss anything publicly” to “you can’t discuss <a href="https://mtlynch.io/i-sold-tinypilot/#what-am-i-allowed-to-say">these two specific things</a> publicly,” and we both felt good about the compromise.</p><h3 id="used-dedicated-accounts-for-the-business">Used dedicated accounts for the business<a href="#used-dedicated-accounts-for-the-business" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h3><p>Part of what made TinyPilot’s ownership handoff smooth was that its accounts and infrastructure were totally separate from my other business and personal accounts:</p><ul><li>I always sent emails related to the business from my @tinypilotkvm.com email address.</li><li>I always used @tinypilotkvm.com email addresses whenever signing up for services on behalf of TinyPilot.</li><li>I kept TinyPilot’s email in a dedicated Fastmail account.<ul><li>This wasn’t true at the beginning. TinyPilot originally shared a Fastmail account with my other businesses, but I eventually migrated it to its own standalone Fastmail account.</li></ul></li><li>I never associated my personal phone number with TinyPilot. Instead, I always used a dedicated Twilio number that forwarded to my real number.</li><li>All account credentials were in Bitwarden.</li></ul><p>After closing, handing over control was extremely straightforward. I just added the new owner to Bitwarden, and they took over from there. There were a few hiccups around 2FA codes I’d forgotten to put in Bitwarden, but we worked those out quickly.</p><h2 id="what-ill-do-differently-in-the-future">What I’ll do differently in the future<a href="#what-ill-do-differently-in-the-future" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h2><h3 id="offer-incentives-for-a-cash-buyer">Offer incentives for a cash buyer<a href="#offer-incentives-for-a-cash-buyer" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h3><p>The last time I bought a house, I requested a 10-day inspection period. I wanted to do standard checks with an inspector and an electrician before completing the purchase.</p><p>The homeowner pushed back and asked me to limit the inspection period to seven days. They were worried about the cost of keeping the house off the market for an extra three days.</p><p>And that’s a house! Its price is far more stable than a small business.</p><p>I didn’t realize how much it would cost to take my business off the market for three whole months.</p><p>Three months of due diligence meant three months where I was distracted from the business and spent 50% of my time on the sale itself. It also disincentivized long-term investments, as they’d reduce short-term profits and deflate the company’s valuation.</p><p>One of the biggest factors for closing time is how the buyer finances the purchase. In TinyPilot’s case, the buyer used a loan from the <a href="https://www.sba.gov/">US Small Business Administration (SBA)</a>, which typically involves three to five months of paperwork and approvals. For TinyPilot, the time from signing the letter of intent to closing day was three months, so we were on the quicker side, but it still felt dreadfully slow.</p><p>The other subtlety of a bank loan is that it complicates the closing contract, which means you spend more on lawyers. Working through the requirements from the bank and the SBA probably consumed $10k in lawyer time on each side, so even if I accepted a lower price from a cash buyer, I’d make some of it back by reducing closing costs.</p><p>Cash deals involve fewer decision-makers and require less paperwork and bureaucracy. I’ve heard of cash deals closing in 30 days or less.</p><p>If I sell another business, I plan to offer incentives that make it easier for the buyer to purchase in cash. I could offer a discount for a cash purchase or make other accommodations to attract buyers who can purchase in cash and make a fast close.</p><h3 id="discuss-key-contract-terms-earlier-in-the-process">Discuss key contract terms earlier in the process<a href="#discuss-key-contract-terms-earlier-in-the-process" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h3><p>The most stressful part of the sale was the contract negotiations, and I’m still not sure how to do it better.</p><p>I didn’t see the first draft of the contract until five weeks into due diligence. By that point, I felt like I was already in a terrible negotiating position. I’d invested so much time and revealed so much during due diligence that I felt exhausted and afraid of starting the whole process over with a new buyer.</p><p>It would be wonderful if the buyer had to present the entire purchase agreement at the letter of intent stage. That way, if I saw terms I didn’t like, I could request adjustments before ever taking TinyPilot off the market or participating in due diligence.</p><p>The problem is that buyers don’t want to spend thousands of dollars of lawyer time drafting a purchase agreement before they’ve gotten some commitment from the seller.</p><p>What I’ll try next time is to negotiate a few terms I care about at the letter of intent stage. I’d want to include things like:</p><ul><li>Short transition time</li><li>Limited restrictions on confidentiality</li><li>Seller liability is limited to 50% of the sale price</li></ul><h3 id="begin-working-with-a-lawyer-earlier">Begin working with a lawyer earlier<a href="#begin-working-with-a-lawyer-earlier" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h3><p>When I started talking with a broker, I also found an M&amp;A law firm to represent me in the sale. The lawyer reviewed the broker agreement, but I didn’t reach out to them again until I had the purchase agreement from the buyer.</p><p>I never asked my lawyer to review the letter of intent, as I figured there wasn’t much value in paying a lawyer to review something that wasn’t legally binding in the first place.</p><p>In retrospect, it would have been helpful to involve my lawyer at that stage, as the letter of intent sets a baseline for the purchase agreement.</p><p>Had I met with my lawyer earlier, they also would have helped me with other due diligence tasks like reviewing my existing contracts and gathering documents the buyer or lender would request later.</p><p>Working with a lawyer at the letter of intent stage also would have been a good opportunity to find out if I liked working with my lawyer. I ended up feeling dissatisfied with mine, but by the time I saw the issues, it was too late to replace him.</p><h3 id="create-an-unofficial-small-stuff-agreement-with-the-buyer">Create an unofficial “small stuff agreement” with the buyer<a href="#create-an-unofficial-small-stuff-agreement-with-the-buyer" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h3><p>TinyPilot had a physical office that was a short drive from my house but a plane ride from the buyer, so they didn’t want to keep it.</p><p>We had about $1k worth of equipment in the office, but the value was spread over so many small items that the cost of liquidating it would cancel out whatever proceeds we’d collect. For example, we could sell our printer for $40, but the cost of interrupting an employee’s normal work to sell a printer is higher than $40.</p><p>Still, the stuff in TinyPilot’s office was a business asset, so the buyer and I felt like we had to define in the asset purchase agreement what should happen to it. We spent several hours enumerating everything of value in the office, working out a timeline of when the buyer would clear it from the office, and how long I’d extend the lease to facilitate that. The buyer and I probably spent $2k on lawyer hours trying to work out how to handle $1k worth of stuff that neither of us wanted.</p><p>If I were to do this again, I’d propose to the buyer a “small stuff agreement.” This would sit outside of the official legal documents and maybe have some header at the top saying, “Nothing in here is a real legal agreement.” And that’s where we could define things where we need to decide <em>something</em>, but the stakes are so small that if one side breaches the agreement, it wouldn’t matter.</p><h3 id="announce-the-sale-to-my-team-later">Announce the sale to my team later<a href="#announce-the-sale-to-my-team-later" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h3><p>When should an owner announce a potential acquisition to their team?</p><p>If you keep the sale a secret until the deal closes, you’re effectively lying to your team.</p><p>If you’re completely transparent about the sale, you bear enormous risk. Members of the team might threaten to leave unless you offer them bonuses or promotions. Or the looming sale might kill their motivation and tank their job performance.</p><p>I had a good relationship with every member of TinyPilot’s team, so I didn’t think anyone would use my candor against me in bargaining. That said, people do unexpected things when a relationship is about to end.</p><p>I chose to reveal the sale to the team at the earliest formal step of the process: when I signed the agreement to begin working with my broker. That ended up being six months before closing.</p><p>I regret that decision <em>slightly</em>.</p><p>Nothing catastrophic happened, but announcing the sale affected management dynamics in certain cases and made it harder to work with employees on performance issues.</p><p>To the team, an acquisition meant the new owner could fire them or drastically change their role. If they wanted to interfere with the sale, they could scare off a buyer and slice $50-100k off the valuation. Worse, they could delay the sale and leave me in a position where I’m managing the company, trying to prepare it for sale, and <a href="https://mtlynch.io/i-sold-tinypilot/#whats-next">caring for a newborn</a> all at the same time.</p><p>I didn’t want a bad outcome for anyone, but the worst case for me was significantly worse than the worst case for any other member of the team.</p><p>If I do this again, I’d wait to tell my team about the sale until it’s a done deal, but I’d also make sure the team knows that an acquisition is always a possibility. I’d explain before I even start looking for a buyer that an acquisition might happen, and that the team won’t necessarily know it’s happening. If it did, I’d prioritize a buyer whose vision aligns with the team’s interests, as I did with TinyPilot.</p><p>This strategy is not ideal or fair to everyone, but it feels like the least bad of many flawed options.</p><h3 id="dont-catastrophize-every-setback">Don’t catastrophize every setback<a href="#dont-catastrophize-every-setback" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h3><p>I found the due diligence process quite stressful and demoralizing, but I made it even harder on myself by catastrophizing everything.</p><p>Every time there was even a potential obstacle in negotiations, I began imagining exactly how this obstacle would ruin everything. I’d ruminate about the bad outcome so much that I’d feel like it already happened, and the deal was dead.</p><p>For example, TinyPilot uses the H.264 video encoding algorithm. It’s patented, so we had to get a license from the patent holder before we shipped that feature. During due diligence, we discovered that the patent license forbade me from transferring the license in an asset sale.</p><p>I immediately started imagining the worst possible outcome. What if the patent holder realizes they can block the sale, and they demand I pay them $100k? What if the patent holder just can’t be bothered to deal with a tiny business like mine, and they block the sale out of sheer indifference?</p><p>I played out negative scenarios all day, and it kept me awake for hours that night.</p><p>The next morning, the buyer emailed to say they’d already heard back from the patent owner. The wheels were in motion for a new license. I’d freaked out when there was no evidence of a problem in the first place.</p><p>If I sell a company in the future, I hope to worry less about potential disasters. I need to remember to sleep on things and see how they feel in the morning.</p><h3 id="reveal-vendors-earlier-but-put-tighter-restrictions-in-the-loi">Reveal vendors earlier, but put tighter restrictions in the LOI<a href="#reveal-vendors-earlier-but-put-tighter-restrictions-in-the-loi" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h3><p>An experienced founder advised me to withhold the names of TinyPilot’s critical vendors until after the deal closed. They explained that you can force the buyer to sign something promising not to use the information if the deal falls through, but it’s hard to enforce that on small-scale deals. The only way to protect the information is not to share it at all.</p><p>I withheld the names of my vendors, but I wouldn’t do it again.</p><p>As part of due diligence, I had to share the last two years of TinyPilot’s bank statements. Our vendor’s names appeared frequently in the statements, so I had to go through a hundred PDFs searching for each vendor’s name, manually drawing black rectangles over them, and rasterizing the PDF to prevent leaks in the metadata.</p><p>A few days later, I sent an inventory report to the buyer and was horrified when he replied, “Who’s FooCorp?”</p><p>“FooCorp” (not their real name) was the very web-searchable name of TinyPilot’s electrical engineering vendor. I forgot that the report mentioned them, so I didn’t redact it before sending.</p><p>And then just a few weeks later, the buyer’s bank firmly insisted on seeing vendor names, so I had to reveal everything anyway.</p><p>If I sell a business in the future, my strategy will be to create a contract that forbids the buyer from acting on insider secrets they learn in due diligence. I’d guard trade secrets more carefully if I were selling to a competitor, but my default would be to rely on the contract to discourage bad behavior.</p><p>Hiding the names of key vendors makes due diligence so much harder. On top of all the contortions to withhold information, missing a single redaction can undo hours of tedious work.</p><h3 id="eliminate-inventory-from-the-brokers-commission">Eliminate inventory from the broker’s commission<a href="#eliminate-inventory-from-the-brokers-commission" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h3><p>My only regret about my broker agreement with Quiet Light was that their commission included the value of TinyPilot’s inventory at the time of the sale.</p><p>The value of TinyPilot’s inventory could vary by a factor of four depending on where we were in the manufacturing cycle. It makes no sense to pay the broker $20k if my inventory happens to be high vs. $5k if my inventory is low.</p><p>Worse, I was selling my inventory to the buyer at cost. It’s not like the broker can negotiate a great price on my unsold inventory and earn their commission that way. If I have $100k in inventory, I only receive $90k for it after paying the broker their commission. The more inventory I had, the more money I’d lose in the sale.</p><p>That said, I got lucky, and the deal closed when TinyPilot’s inventory was at its ideal level for the sale. On closing day, we were a couple of weeks away from placing our next manufacturing order for the subsequent eight months. That was perfect because we were low but not so low that the new buyer was coming in understocked. On top of that, there’s wiggle room in calculating inventory value for the broker fee, and Quiet Light calculated it in a way that was especially generous to me.</p><p>Still, the broker fee on inventory was one more layer that made timing stressful. If the deal had stretched out another month, I’d have lost $10k on additional broker fees for the inventory.</p><p>If I do this again, I’ll push the broker to eliminate inventory from the fee, even if it means giving them a higher percentage of the sale price.</p><h3 id="assume-from-the-start-that-nothing-written-is-private">Assume from the start that nothing written is private<a href="#assume-from-the-start-that-nothing-written-is-private" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h3><p>The acquisition was for TinyPilot’s assets, including all company emails. This seemed reasonable, as a lot of institutional knowledge is buried in old emails.</p><p>As I started thinking more about the sale, I realized that some of my email would be complicated to hand over. What if an employee had said something that was personal and private?</p><p>As a fictional example, imagine I had an email from an employee that said, “Ever since my father died, I’ve been struggling with anxiety and depression, and I’ve been feeling unproductive.” That email would be to Michael, their human co-worker, not Michael, the corporate owner of TinyPilot’s email assets. It felt strange and cold to sell that email to the new buyer.</p><p>Fortunately, I worked out an agreement between the buyer and the team that before closing, anyone could flag private, personal emails, and I’d purge them before closing.</p><p>There were also other sensitive emails, like conversations with my lawyer about the acquisition itself. I didn’t want the buyer to see our private discussions even after the sale was complete, so the purchase agreement excluded those emails from the sale.</p><p>In the future, I’d make two changes in how I approach emails in my business:</p><ul><li>Make sure everyone on the team understands that in the case of an acquisition, any emails and meeting notes will transfer to the new buyer.</li><li>When working with lawyers and brokers on the sale itself, do it from a separate email account from the business I’m selling.</li></ul><h3 id="define-what-happens-to-money-flows-around-the-time-of-closing">Define what happens to money flows around the time of closing<a href="#define-what-happens-to-money-flows-around-the-time-of-closing" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h3><p>When we reached closing day, we realized the contract left a lot of ambiguity around who’s entitled to money flowing in and out of the business around the time of the closing:</p><ul><li>How do you split bills for services that straddle the closing (e.g., a monthly charge that will be billed again a week after closing)?</li><li>What happens to money in PayPal or Shopify that hasn’t yet transferred to your bank?</li><li>Who pays when a customer purchases before closing but requests a refund after closing?</li><li>Who receives revenue from sales on closing day?</li><li>Who pays employees for work on closing day?</li><li>Who pays fees associated with closing (e.g., escrow fees)?</li></ul><p>The buyer and I found amicable resolutions for everything after the fact, but I wish we had answered these questions more explicitly in the closing contract.</p><h3 id="in-the-transition-agreement-value-calendar-days-more-than-work-hours">In the transition agreement, value calendar days more than work hours<a href="#in-the-transition-agreement-value-calendar-days-more-than-work-hours" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h3><p>Most acquisitions have terms around how much work the seller agrees to do after the sale to help the buyer with the post-close transition.</p><p>My initial offer to the buyer was that I’d do free consulting for two weeks after the closing for up to 40 hours per week. After that, he could purchase consulting hours from me at $180/hr for up to 10 hours per week.</p><p>The buyer counteroffered 30 days of free consulting with a maximum of 80 hours total. That is, the same total hours stretched over a longer period.</p><p>I knew a longer transition period would be a better deal for the buyer, but I didn’t realize how much it would cost me.</p><p>Even though I was available for 40 hours per week, the buyer couldn’t really use all of those hours. He’s taking over a team of six employees and learning to run everything, so it’s hard for him to direct my time enough to fill 40 hours per week right out of the gate.</p><p>I ended up only working about 10 hours per week, but there was still a high cost to me being available every workday for 30 days. There was nothing in the contract about how quickly I had to respond to emails, but I checked my TinyPilot inbox every hour or so. If I did two hours of transition work in a day, it was often spread into several 30-minute chunks, so I didn’t get much else done.</p><h3 id="disconnect-non-transferable-accounts-from-business-email-before-closing">Disconnect non-transferable accounts from business email before closing<a href="#disconnect-non-transferable-accounts-from-business-email-before-closing" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h3><p>Sales below $1M are usually asset sales, meaning that the buyer is purchasing assets from the business but not the business itself. So, I technically still own a company called TinyPilot, but I transferred all of its physical and intellectual property to the new owner.</p><p>The few assets I kept were TinyPilot’s banking and payroll accounts, as they’re bound to the LLC itself. The problem was that I forgot to change the email address on those accounts before I handed over control of TinyPilot’s email to the new buyer, so they still had <code>@tinypilotkvm.com</code> emails.</p><p>I worked with the new owner to fix the email address on those accounts, but I wish I’d done it myself before transferring TinyPilot’s email.</p><h3 id="take-even-fewer-dependencies-on-google">Take even fewer dependencies on Google<a href="#take-even-fewer-dependencies-on-google" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h3><p>All of TinyPilot’s account credentials were in Bitwarden, so transferring ownership of accounts was smooth.

I used Google Cloud Platform for some TinyPilot services, and I had a dedicated TinyPilot GCP project, but it was within my personal Google account.</p><p>There’s a big “Migrate” button at the top of the GCP project settings page, so I naïvely thought pushing that button would let me — I don’t know, <em>migrate</em> the project to the new owner’s GCP account.</p><p><a href="https://mtlynch.io/lessons-from-my-first-exit/gcp-migrate.webp"><img sizes="(min-width: 768px) 574px, 98vw" srcset="https://mtlynch.io/lessons-from-my-first-exit/gcp-migrate_hue9dc84b46d66618030c8d9a3205ca1c7_2230_300x0_resize_q90_h2_lanczos_2.webp 300w,

We had a similar issue with some notes and old documents that I’d stored in Google Drive.</p><p>The new owner decided it was too much hassle to do the official migration, so I exported what I could, and we deleted the rest.</p><p>In general, I’ve tried to minimize my dependencies on Google, both personally and professionally. Google frequently burns me on corner cases like these, so this is a further reminder to depend on them even less.</p><h2 id="what-surprised-me">What surprised me<a href="#what-surprised-me" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h2><h3 id="due-diligence-is-unbounded-high-stress-work">Due diligence is unbounded, high-stress work<a href="#due-diligence-is-unbounded-high-stress-work" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h3><p>I greatly underestimated how labor-intensive the due diligence process would be.</p><p>At the start, I thought due diligence would be somewhat tedious but still straightforward. The buyer had already seen two years of profit and loss statements before they even signed the LOI. Maybe they’d spot-check a few bank statements to verify that my numbers were real. Perhaps I’d have an opportunity to show off my immaculate bookkeeping ledger, of which I was quite proud.</p><p>It turned out that the due diligence process required me to share <em>all</em> of my bank statements from the last two years. And that was just part of the first round of requests.</p><p>As we proceeded further into the due diligence process, I needed to create lots of one-off reports to demonstrate different aspects of my business, like how frequently our customers make repeat purchases or which platforms account for what percentage of our revenue.</p><p>I didn’t want to expose customer data, so I did custom processing on our reports to avoid leaking customer details. But the more I customized the reports, the more I risked introducing errors into my records. And if I made an error, the buyer would have grounds to sue me later for selling the company based on fraudulent data. So, even for simple reports, I felt stressed about doing them perfectly.</p><p>A non-cash buyer makes it harder to push back on due diligence requests. The buyer was presenting me with requests from both himself and the bank. The bank was hard to negotiate with because they didn’t care if the deal fell through. I was more comfortable pushing back against the buyer because he had skin in the game and was motivated to make a deal. But I can’t ask the buyer, “Is this request coming from you or from the bank? Because if it’s you, I’m going to say no; if it’s the bank, I’ll say yes.”</p><h3 id="as-you-prepare-to-sell-everything-costs-4x-as-much">As you prepare to sell, everything costs 4x as much<a href="#as-you-prepare-to-sell-everything-costs-4x-as-much" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h3><p>When you sell a small business, the sale price is usually some multiple of your profit or revenue.</p><p>If your annual profit was $100k and businesses like yours sell at 3x annual profit, then you could sell your business for roughly $300k.</p><p>Now, imagine you decided to give one of your employees a $10k bonus.

In that process, the broker does a lot of things I don’t understand or know how to do like listing on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_listing_service">MLS</a> or ensuring we’re following municipal regulations for the sale.</p><p>Quiet Light’s main contribution was finding a buyer, as that’s something I couldn’t have done on my own. After that, they’re outside of the critical path of the deal. Once we found a buyer, the heavy lifting of getting the deal to close was on my M&amp;A lawyer to prepare and negotiate all the legal documents.</p><p>The M&amp;A broker should provide guidance to keep the deal on track, which Quiet Light did. They even found a new lender when the buyer’s lender backed out. But if my broker had disappeared after the LOI, we could have completed the sale without a broker, whereas I couldn’t have closed without a lawyer.</p><p>If I sell a business in the future, I may forego a broker if I can find a buyer independently. As a first-time seller, it was worth 15% of the sale price to have an advisor on my side from start to finish. Now that I have more experience, I’d feel more comfortable going through the process on my own, but I valued the broker enough that I’d always keep the option open.</p><h3 id="if-the-non-compete-is-too-restrictive-youre-screwed">If the non-compete is too restrictive, you’re screwed<a href="#if-the-non-compete-is-too-restrictive-youre-screwed" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h3><p>If a big tech company hires me as a developer, and the 500th page of my contract says I can never write software for any other company, a judge would likely reject that non-compete as unfair and unenforceable.</p><p>If, however, I sell my company, and the purchase agreement says that I agree to never work in software again, a judge might hold me to that promise. My lawyer warned me that judges are stricter in acquisition agreements, as they assume I had reasonable bargaining power and awareness of the agreement. If I signed a bad deal, it’s on me.</p><p>When reviewing TinyPilot’s purchase agreement, my lawyer carefully reviewed the non-compete clause with me to ensure that I was only agreeing not to work in the domain of KVM over IP devices rather than software or technology in general.</p><h3 id="if-theres-no-cap-on-liability-youre-screwed">If there’s no cap on liability, you’re screwed<a href="#if-theres-no-cap-on-liability-youre-screwed" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h3><p>When you run a business in the US as a corporation or an LLC, the most you can ever lose is the value of the business itself.</p><p>If your business is worth $100k, and someone sues you for $5M, the worst that can happen is that they take your business.

<p>A few months ago, I was adapting an official guide for an AWS service. Specifically, <a href="https://docs.amplify.aws/react/build-a-backend/data/custom-business-logic/search-and-aggregate-queries/">integrating OpenSearch with Amplify</a>. I worked through the guide, and modified and debugged it for my own purposes. A few weeks later, I received an AWS bill for over $1200, and almost had a heart attack. I hadn’t selected the most expensive OS instance type. I hadn’t even used it much at all. I had worked with Amplify &amp; OpenSearch back in 2020 (back when it still was ElasticSearch). It’s pricey for personal use, usually around $50 per month, but not $1200.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Elliott</strong></p>

  <p>I think the [OpenSearch] domains should have only been billed for part of the month, for one machine.</p>

  <p>The Amplify + OpenSearch behavior was unexpected. While I appreciate it if you waive my charges, I would also recommend raising this issue to the team in charge of documentation/implementation at Amplify.</p>

  <p>Name of the Service: Amazon OpenSearch Service</p>

  <p>Total Amount: 1,124.88</p>

  <p>Time Frame( in Days, Weeks and Months): One Month</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>AWS Customer Support</strong></p>

  <p>After a detailed review of your case and account, I’m happy to inform you that we’ve processed a billing adjustment for the unexpected charges as a one time courtesy.</p>

  <p>[…] Regarding your follow-up notes, I have reached out to the concerned team to investigate it further […]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I opened a support ticket with AWS. I narrowed down what happened. There were a few behaviors with Amplify + OpenSearch that I felt were oversights. The response from AWS was prompt. They had me set up a budget alert and gave me service credit for both OpenSearch and its storage. Kudos! Even if you are not using Amplify/OpenSearch, I recommend getting familiar with AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-budgets/">budgets</a>. They predict future spend, for a service or for AWS as a whole, and can send you alerts if you are projected to break them. However, I was terrified from that experience, and set the project, and Amplify, aside.</p>

<p>I came back to it recently and… The behavior still exists! This post exists to caution the reader about using AWS Amplify, especially with OpenSearch. That said, let’s jump into how you can rack up thousands of dollars of compute by just following the official guide.</p>

<h2 id="1-follow-quickstart">1. Follow Quickstart</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.amplify.aws/react/start/quickstart/">quickstart</a> is pretty straightforward. You spin up a toy app, with code provided by AWS, that includes DB schema for TODO notes. Amplify creates a DynamoDB database as well as authenticated CRUD requests for you. You also get a nice login flow, and it intelligently only shows the right TODOs to the right users. You can run it locally, but Amplify also creates a domain that you can visit.</p>

<p>Enjoy the cute formatted build status update:</p>
<div><pre><code>✨ hotswapping resources:
   ✨ AWS::AppSync::ApiKey '******'
✨ AWS::AppSync::ApiKey '*******' hotswapped!

 ✅  amplify-amplifyvitereacttemplate-mymac-sandbox-xxxx

✨  Deployment time: 4.82s

</code></pre></div>

<p>Here is what the webapp looks like:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><img src="https://elliott-king.github.io/assets/images/amplify_overcharge/screenshot_initial_app.png" alt="Webapp after quickstart" title="Webapp after quickstart"></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><em>Webapp after quickstart</em></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="2-follow-guide-for-opensearch-setup">2. Follow Guide for OpenSearch Setup</h2>
<p><a href="https://docs.amplify.aws/react/build-a-backend/data/custom-business-logic/search-and-aggregate-queries/">The next part I followed</a> involves writing a bunch of Typescript boilerplate for the Amplify to declare your resources. You don’t need to commit this to memory, but here’s a quick overview:</p>
<ul>
  <li>set DynamoDB table as a variable so we can reference it elsewhere and use it in the pipeline</li>
  <li>create an OpenSearch instance, index, and indexMapping (where you declare the fields &amp; their types)</li>
  <li>write a query to access the data living in OpenSearch</li>
  <li>create an OpenSearchIngestionService pipeline to copy from DDB -&gt; OS</li>
</ul>

<p>All of this is written in Typescript/Javascript, and lives in your repo with the frontend code. The CLI command is <code>npx ampx sandbox</code>, which spins up the AWS services. It detects changes to your configuration, and automatically modifies the existing AWS services as needed.</p>

<p>At this point, we have a DynamoDB database, one OpenSearch service, one OSIS pipeline, and various other things (like IAM roles).</p>

      <td><em>r5.large.search instance pricing</em></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="3-shut-it-down-for-the-day">3. Shut it Down for the Day</h2>
<p>Nice job, you are done with work for the day. You hit <code>CTRL-C</code> and stop your sandbox. It asks if you want to delete everything permanently. Not wanting to go over budget, you say “Y”.</p>

<p>If you were a smarter cookie than me, you may double-check the AWS console. Is everything gone? DynamoDB is gone, but your OpenSearch domain is still there!</p>

<h2 id="4-spin-it-back-up">4. Spin it back up</h2>
<p>You come back in the morning and re-create your services. You need an OpenSearch instance, but <code>npx ampx sandbox</code> will create a new one. In fact, running <code>npx ampx sandbox delete</code> will not delete your original instance. You suddenly have two OpenSearch domains! Rinse and repeat a few times, and you will find yourself with multiple domains in the background, ticking up to thousands of dollars in dues to AWS.</p>

  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><img src="https://elliott-king.github.io/assets/images/amplify_overcharge/two_domains.png" alt="Two OpenSearch domains" title="Two OpenSearch domains"></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><em>Two OpenSearch domains created for the same project</em></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="is-this-a-bug">Is This a Bug?</h2>

<p>I certainly think so, but it hasn’t been addressed since my customer support ticket with AWS. This seems like a huge footgun. There are <a href="https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-cli/issues/10523">a few old bug reports</a>, but I did not find anything from less than a year ago. Perhaps the OpenSearch domain was correctly deleted in v1, but no longer in v2. Regardless, it’s now run through <code>npx</code>, not the Amplify CLI.</p>

<p>In addition, I am also irked by the fact that the <code>r5.large.search</code> is the default machine type. In my opinion, there shouldn’t be a default at all, it should be a required field. The <em>guide</em> should default to <code>r5.large.search</code> so it’s more visible to the user. This default is not Amplify-specific, however, so I don’t blame the Amplify team. It’s part of the AWS CDK.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>A certain section of readers will be quick to say, “you should understand what you are working on” or “you should double check pricing.” That is technically correct, but misses the point. It’s so difficult to be paranoid about every single technology you use. When using new technologies that promise to speed up the developer flow, I already expect them to be more expensive than bare metal, but I think this is beyond the pale. It’s again worth noting that AWS does have a “budget” console, and you can use this to receive alerts to warn if you are projected to go over budget. In fact, AWS required me to set up a budget before sending me credit for the unused OpenSearch domains.</p>

<p>I’m not sure if Amazon doc writers expect you to double-check all this. It’s a complicated piece of technology at a complicated company, so I think it’s more likely an oversight than intended behavior. There is so much going on within the Amplify guide. Just <a href="https://docs.amplify.aws/react/build-a-backend/data/custom-business-logic/search-and-aggregate-queries/">within the OpenSearch section</a>, it creates IAM accounts, an OpenSearch domain, an OSIS pipeline, a log group, and s3 storage. Because OpenSearch is often used for enterprise customers, I wonder if OpenSearch is considered “advanced,” and users of OS are expected to have a stronger understanding of the AWS ecosystem. I’ll admit that I myself am only using OpenSearch because it supports <code>geo_point</code> bounding-box queries, a subject that I don’t have a full understanding of. Perhaps there is a way to do these with a simpler product, and OpenSearch is overkill. Perhaps this relates to a larger problem: it’s difficult to figure out what you need when you start with conscious incompetence on the internet.</p>

          <p>The classic PC games market is "in a sorry state," according to DRM-free and classic-minded storefront GOG. Small games that aren't currently selling get abandoned, and compatibility issues arise as technology moves forward or as one-off development ideas age like milk.</p>
<p>Classic games are only 20 percent of GOG's catalog, and the firm hasn't actually called itself "Good Old Games" in 12 years. And yet, today, GOG announces that it is making "a significant commitment of resources" toward a new GOG Preservation Program. It starts with 100 games for which GOG's own developers are working to create current and future compatibility, keeping them DRM-free and giving them ongoing tech support, along with granting them a "Good Old Game: Preserved by GOG" stamp.</p>

<p>GOG is not shifting its mission of providing a DRM-free alternative to Steam, Epic, and other PC storefronts, at least not entirely. But it is demonstrably excited about a new focus that ties back to its original name, inspired in some part by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/5-years-after-it-was-yanked-off-stores-gogs-bringing-underrated-spy-rpg-alpha-protocol-in-from-the-cold-with-fewer-crashes-and-new-achievements/">its work on </a><em><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/5-years-after-it-was-yanked-off-stores-gogs-bringing-underrated-spy-rpg-alpha-protocol-in-from-the-cold-with-fewer-crashes-and-new-achievements/">Alpha Protocol</a>.</em></p>
<p>"We think we can significantly impact the classics industry by focusing our resources on it and creating superior products," writes Arthur Dejardin, head of sales and marketing at GOG. "If we wanted to spread the DRM-free gospel by focusing on getting new AAA games on GOG instead, we would make little progress with the same amount of effort and money (we’ve been trying various versions of that for the last 5 years)."</p>

<h2>Getting knights, demons, and zombies up to snuff</h2>
<p>What kind of games? Scanning the list of <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/gog-preservation-program">Good Old Games</a>, most of them are, by all accounts, both good and old. Personally, I'm glad to see the <em>Jagged Alliance</em> games,&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2</em>,&nbsp;<em>Warcraft I &amp; II</em>,&nbsp;<em>Dungeon Keeper</em> <em>Gold </em>and&nbsp;<em>Theme Park</em>,&nbsp;<em>SimCity 3000 Unlimited,&nbsp;</em>and the&nbsp;<em>Wing Commander</em> series (particularly, personally,&nbsp;<em>Privateer)</em>. Most of them are, understandably, Windows-only, though Mac support extends to 34 titles so far, and Linux may pick up many more through Proton compatibility beyond the 19 native titles to date.</p>

<p dir="auto">Responses are then written simply as slices of bytes, headers can be arbitrarily
manipulated and so on. This approach offers much needed flexibility for these
who really need it.</p>
<p dir="auto">Unfortunately, this approach leaves great space for introducing security
vulnerabilities and even experienced developers tend to do so.</p>
<p dir="auto">This document aims to design an HTTP API that eliminates whole classes of bugs,
like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or Cross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF). This can
be achieved by an approach known at Google as <em>safe coding</em>. Learn more at

<p dir="auto">Imagine an API for configuring access control. It features three types of rules:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>ALLOW(user)</code> - allows a given <code>user</code></li>
<li><code>DENY(user)</code> - denies a given <code>user</code> (has priority over <code>ALLOW</code>)</li>
<li><code>REPORT(user)</code> - reports that it has seen a request from a given <code>user</code></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Imagine now that at some point, security standards need to be increased and
<code>user = "frombulator"</code> has been determined to not meet the desired bar.</p>
<p dir="auto">How do we, for all the services running in our company, address this?</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>For existing services, we add a <code>LegacyFrombulatorAccess</code> option like so:
<code>security.AccessControl(rules, unsafe.LegacyFrombulatorAccess())</code>.</li>
<li>We change the <code>security.AccessControl()</code> call to add by default a
<code>DENY("frombulator")</code> rule. This rule <strong>is not added</strong> if
<code>unsafe.LegacyFrombulatorAccess</code> is applied.</li>
<li>Instead, <code>unsafe.LegacyFrombulatorAccess</code> adds a <code>REPORT("frombulator")</code>
rule.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">This way, we have:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Ensured that all new callers of <code>security.AccessControl</code> use the safe setting
by default.</li>
<li>Can monitor existing services dependence on calls from the <code>frombulator</code>.
After a period of observation (let’s say, 30 days):
<ul dir="auto">
<li>If the service doesn’t receive requests from the <code>frombulator</code>: <strong>prune the
<code>unsafe.LegacyFrombulatorAccess</code></strong> option.</li>
<li>If the service does receive requests from the <code>frombulator</code>: <strong>inform the
service owners and plan a fix.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Crucially, only the last case (dependence on unsafe configuration) requires
engineering work per service. The rest can be automated.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>This approach is possible due to careful API design.</strong> A missing <code>DENY</code> or
<code>REPORT</code> rule, or a single sink in the form of <code>security.AccessControl</code> would
make this infeasible.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><heading></heading><div><p><h3>Dan Salmon</h3></p><p><em>November 11 2024</em></p></div><content><h3 id="the-issue">The Issue</h3><p>Yesterday when trying to transfer an ISO file from a TrueNAS SMB share, I was getting horrible transfer speeds.</p><figure><img src="https://danthesalmon.com/windows-smb-tailscale/slow1.png" alt="Copy progress dialog window showing a speed of 355KB/s"></figure><p>The NAS can definitely saturate a gigabit link which is what my desktop connects to the switch over. I had seen this behavior before and had a feeling it was related to having Tailscale running - the last time it happened I quit Tailscale and my fast transfers returned.</p><p>Why would this matter?</p><p>Well, in my home network I have a Proxmox VM that, among other things, runs Tailscale as a <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1019/subnets" target="_blank">subnet router</a>. I set it up this way so that my homelab services (especially Pi-hole) are available to my laptop and phone from outside my house.</p><p>Consequently, my desktop now has 2 interfaces that can both reach my trusted <code>10.10.1.1/24</code> network - the gigabit NIC connected to the switch and the Tailscale virtual adapter.</p><p>A quick online search led me to a thread <a href="https://forum.tailscale.com/t/windows-routes-all-smb-traffic-through-tailscale-even-when-lan-ip-is-specified-is-much-slower/1995" target="_blank">on the Tailscale forums</a> describing the exact behavior I was seeing.</p><p>I learned that Windows has a system for determining which interface will handle a request when multiple interfaces could be used. Just like dynamic routing protocols calculate the “cost” of each route to a remote network, Windows has a system to calculate which interface to use. Windows refers to this cost as the “Interface Metric” which is calculated based on the physical interface medium and its link speed (as documented <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/networking/automatic-metric-for-ipv4-routes" target="_blank">here</a> in the last table).</p><p>Since the Tailscale interface advertises a link speed of 100Gbps, Windows assigns it a much lower interface metric than the integrated gigabit NIC on my motherboard. Lower metric = lower “cost” associated.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="powershell"><span><span>PS C:\&gt; Get-NetAdapter | Where-Object {$_.Name <span>-EQ</span> <span>"Tailscale"</span> <span>-or</span> $_.Name <span>-EQ</span> <span>"Ethernet"</span>}

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Since the beginning of September, I’ve been <a href="https://blog.kaplich.me/i-am-looking-for-a-job-as-a-frontend-developer/">searching for a job</a> after <a href="https://blog.kaplich.me/i-got-laid-off-and-i-feel-fine/">being laid off from my previous role</a> at the end of June.</p>
<p>The market is tough, lot’s of fake jobs, so it’s been pretty challenging to even land an interview. Still, I managed to get a few, and, well, not all of them were great — though not necessarily because of my performance.</p>
<p>Here are two examples I’d like to share.</p>
<h2>The Good One</h2>
<p>I applied for a design engineer role at an interesting startup. I know it’s a popular role right now, but I thought that with my experience on <a href="https://kaplich.me/projects">personal projects</a>, work with Figma, and my love for design, I might have a chance.</p>
<p>My first interview was with a recruiter who asked me a lot about my experience and why I wanted to join their company. It wasn’t the usual generic talk; he actually seemed to want to get to know me better. By the end, he said I’d have a chance to speak with the hiring manager the next day.</p>
<p>The following day, I had another great conversation with the person who would be my manager. Again, it was an amazing talk, touching on work attitude, ethics, and experiences, both good and bad.</p>
<p>A week later, I had a technical interview with a senior engineer, which went well too. I reached the final rounds, where I was supposed to present my projects to the team. The presentation was fine, but I sensed something was off.</p>
<p>A few days later, I received a rejection <em>with feedback</em>. They were happy with my technical skills, but they were looking for someone with more design experience. Disappointing, but understandable.</p>
<p>At least now I know where I need to improve for next time. Overall, I left with a positive impression of the company and would definitely love to work there in the future if I get the chance.</p>
<h2>The Bad One</h2>
<p>I applied for a web engineering role. A few days later, I got an email from the recruiter: “Hi Sergey, I added a task to the job description. Please apply again and complete the task.”</p>
<p>The task looked like a code line that I needed to decipher — sounded interesting, but time consuming. And there was one more thing: the salary listed in the description had dropped by $30,000.</p>
<p>I followed up with the recruiter: “Hey! I saw you added an assignment, but the salary also changed. Is this an error, or is it the actual salary for the role?”</p>
<p>He replied that it wasn’t an error.</p>
<p>That was my first red flag. But the role still sounded interesting, and the task itself looked like a fun challenge, so I spent a few hours solving it. It was tricky, but I really enjoyed working on it.</p>
<p>I sent in the completed task, and a few days later, the recruiter replied that everything looked good and that the next step would be an initial interview.</p>
<p>I booked a time on his calendar, waited a week, and then, two hours before the interview, he messaged me saying the company had an onsite and he couldn’t find the time. He asked to reschedule for another day. Another red flag.</p>
<p>I booked a new meeting, waited another week, and on the morning of our rescheduled meeting, he messaged me again to say he wasn’t feeling well.</p>
<p>Okay, let’s try one more time.</p>
<p>In the meantime I noticed that they changed back the salary, but the team was changed, so it was kind of confusing to understand, what tasks I am supposed to work on.</p>
<p>Eventually, we had the conversation, though he was late. He apologized, and we had a decent talk. Recruiter said he’d get back to me next week to schedule the technical round. But instead, three days later, he sent me a rejection email, saying they had too many applicants.</p>
<p>That was a few weeks ago, and the role is still open.</p>
<p>I have no idea what was going on with that process, but I feel kind of lucky I didn’t end up there.</p>
<p>So yeah, the market is tough. There were other good (and not so good) interviews, but these ones were really special.</p>
<p>I’m still looking for my next role and hoping it’ll happen soon. And if you happen to be looking for an amazing web developer or frontend engineer, please <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/skaplich/">let me know</a>.</p>

We think that the benefits of being on X are now outweighed by the negatives and that resources could be better used promoting our journalism elsewhere.</p><p>This is something we have been considering for a while given the often disturbing content promoted or found on the platform, including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/sep/05/racism-misogyny-lies-how-did-x-become-so-full-of-hatred-and-is-it-ethical-to-keep-using-it" data-link-name="in body link">far-right conspiracy theories and racism</a>. The US presidential election campaign served only to underline what we have considered for a long time: that X is a toxic media platform and that its owner, Elon Musk, has been able to use its influence to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/04/elon-musk-x-network-donald-trump" data-link-name="in body link">shape political discourse</a>.</p><p>X users will still be able to share our articles, and the nature of live news reporting means we will still occasionally embed content from X within our article pages.</p><p>Our reporters will also be able to carry on using the site for news-gathering purposes, just as they use other social networks in which we do not officially engage.</p><p>Social media can be an important tool for news organisations and help us to reach new audiences but, at this point, X now plays a diminished role in promoting our work. Our journalism is available and open to all on our website and we would prefer people to come to <a href="http://theguardian.com/" data-link-name="in body link">theguardian.com</a> and support our work there.</p><p>Thankfully, we can do this because our business model does not rely on viral content tailored to the whims of the social media giants’ algorithms – instead we’re funded directly by our readers.
