<h2 id="where-to-start">Where to start</h2>
<p>See below for links to the <a href="#inventory">2024 winning IOCCC entries</a>.</p>
<p>Check out the <code>index.html</code> web pages for each winning entry. They have
most of the information you need to compile and run the winning program.
Take a look at the winning source code and try to figure out how it works.
You might also want to check out the author’s remarks for even more details.</p>
<p>You may <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/2024/2024.tar.bz2">download all winning entries</a> in the form
of a compressed tarball, for this year’s contest.</p>

<p>This year marked the <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/faq.html#ioccc_start">40th anniversary of the IOCCC</a>.
The <strong>IOCCC28</strong> opened submissions from <strong>2025-03-05 23:19:17.131107 UTC</strong> to <strong>2025-06-05
04:03:02.010099 UTC</strong> after a 4 year pause.</p>
<p>A significant portion of those 4 years was an effort by a <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/thanks-for-help.html">number of people</a>,
with over 6168+ commits, to rebuild the <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/index.html">Official IOCCC website</a>
in what became known as the <strong>Great Fork Merge</strong>.</p>
<p>Another portion of those 4 years went into retooling the IOCCC, including the creation of
the <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry">mkiocccentry toolkit</a>, a new
<a href="https://www.ioccc.org/next/register.html">IOCCC registration process</a>, and a new
<a href="https://submit.ioccc.org/">IOCCC submit server</a> (which may not be up if the contest is closed).</p>
<p>The <strong>major motivation</strong> for the above was to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Present <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/years.html">IOCCC winners</a> that that honors the contributions of all of the <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/authors.html">winning authors</a> from <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/location.html">around the world</a>,</p></li>
<li><p>Reduce the administrative effort required by the <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/judges.html">IOCCC Judges</a> to run the contest, and</p></li>
<li><p>Minimize the time between when the winners of the IOCCC are selected and when the source is made available.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>On the last point, for <strong>IOCCC28</strong> the Judging started on <strong>2025-06-05 04:03:02.010099 UTC</strong> and then the winners were selected by the <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/judges.html">IOCCC Judges</a> on <strong>2025-07-07 20:05:07.000000 UTC</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Winners were announced during a live the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@OurFavoriteUniverse">Our Favorite Universe</a> YouTube Channel that started on <strong>2025-08-02 18:00:00.000000 UTC</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Near the end of the 2 hour XXX-add-show-URL-here-XXX YouTube show, the <strong>source code</strong> of the <a href="#inventory">IOCCC28 winning entries</a> was published on <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner">IOCCC GitHub winner repo</a> and on the <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/index.html">Official IOCCC website</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>No longer will there be many months</strong> between when the winners are
announced and their source code is made available. For <strong>IOCCC28</strong>
the time was <strong>less than 2 hours</strong>. :-)</p>
<h3 id="increased-submission-quantity-and-quality">Increased submission quantity and quality</h3>
<p>The submissions to <strong>IOCCC28</strong> were remarkable when compared with previous contests, in both the
<strong>increased quantity and quality</strong> of the submissions. As a result the judging process for <strong>IOCCC28</strong>
was more challenging and required greater effort. Thankfully due to the above mentioned improvements,
the judging process <strong>took only 33 days</strong>. Under the previous system it <strong>would have taken much longer</strong>!</p>
<p>One thing that began to emerge after we exits the early rounds of judging and entered the middle rounds
of judging was that we were very likely to have more winning entries than in previous contests.
Even so, the final rounds of judging required more rounds and tool longer than in any previous IOCCC.</p>
<p>At the end of the final round of the final rounds of judging, we had a record <strong>23 winners of IOCCC28</strong>,
eclipsing the record of 15 winners!</p>
<p>While we suspect that the 4 year gap between <strong>IOCCC27</strong> and <strong>IOCCC28</strong> allowed people extra
time to improve their submissions, we also believe that people submitting to the IOCCC have
adept in obfuscation and have become more skilled in the programming in the C language.</p>
<h3 id="code-size-and-rule-2">Code size and Rule 2</h3>
<p>We were pleased to observe that while the <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/faq.html#size_rule_history">IOCCC size limit</a>
increased by about 21%, we received many submissions that were well under the new
<a href="https://www.ioccc.org/next/rules.html#rule2">Rule 2 size limit</a> including a fair number of quality
small and medium sized submissions. Half of the <strong>IOCCC28 winners</strong> were less than
<em>2/3 of the size limit</em>, and 10 of the <strong>IOCCC28 winners</strong> were less than
<em>1/2 of the size limit</em>!</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE</strong>: The <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/faq.html#size_rule_history">IOCCC size limit</a> increase for <strong>IOCCC28</strong>
was the first size increase in over 10 years. Given the quality of submissions we received
that were well under the limit, we do <strong>NOT</strong> expect to change the
<a href="https://www.ioccc.org/next/rules.html#rule2">Rule 2 size limit</a> for <strong>at least another 10 years</strong> (and likely longer).</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT HINT</strong>: Only 3 of 23 the <strong>IOCCC28 winners</strong> came close to the <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/next/rules.html#rule2">Rule 2 size limit</a>.
Large code size isn’t everything. :-) Those submitting to future contents should
<strong>take a careful note</strong> of that fact.</p>
<h3 id="rules-and-guidelines-for-this-contest">Rules and Guidelines for this contest</h3>
<p>Here are the final versions of the IOCCC rules and guidelines that were in effect for this contest:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ioccc.org/2024/rules.html">2024 rules</a> version <strong>28.30 2025-03-03</strong></li>
<li><a href="https://www.ioccc.org/2024/guidelines.html">2024 guidelines</a> version <strong>28.47 2025-03-15</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="looking-forward-to-the-next-contest">Looking forward to the next contest</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/judges.html">IOCCC Judges</a> realize that the <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/next/rules.html">IOCCC rules</a> and
the <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/next/guidelines.html">IOCCC guidelines</a> need to be <strong>greatly improved and streamlined</strong>.
We decided to not overhaul them for <strong>IOCCC28</strong> so as to <strong>NOT</strong> delay the opening of the contest.</p>
<p>After the <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/judges.html">IOCCC Judges</a> take a short <em>IOCCC Vacation</em> (we have been working solid
on <strong>IOCCC28</strong> since <strong>2020 Dec 30</strong>), we plan to update, improve and streamline the
<a href="https://www.ioccc.org/next/rules.html">IOCCC rules</a> and the <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/next/guidelines.html">IOCCC guidelines</a> for <strong>IOCCC29</strong>.
Then we will address whatever bug fixes in the form of GitHub Pull Requests to both the
<a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner">IOCCC GitHub winner repo</a> and the
<a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry">mkiocccentry toolkit repo</a> that may be pending.</p>
<p>Once we are all caught up, we will set the opening date for <strong>IOCCC29</strong>. It is our plan
to open <strong>IOCCC29</strong> sometime in <strong>2025 December</strong>.</p>

<p>There were a number of remarkable winning entries for <strong>IOCCC28</strong>. We wish to call
attention to a few of them:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ioccc.org/2024/kurdyukov1/index.html">2024/kurdyukov1</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This entry is a fun revisit of the theme of <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/2000/natori/index.html">2000/natori</a>,
only better and without using any floating point arithmetic. You are invited
to try and understand why the constant <code>2551443</code> is common to both entries.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ioccc.org/2024/cable1/index.html">2024/cable1</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This entry claims to be “<em>the world’s smallest LLM (large language
model) inference engine</em>”: running open-source model based on Meta’s
LLaMA 2 with 7 billion parameters. After downloading the model via the
<a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/blob/master/2024/cable1/get_model.sh">2024/cable1/get_model.sh</a> script,
we invite you explore this <strong>ChatIOCCC</strong> tool. While not super fast,
the tool’s output can be amusing.</p>
<p>You might wish to ask <strong>ChatIOCCC</strong>: “<em>Why did this entry win IOCCC28?</em>”?</p>
<p>We encourage you to read and understand the
<a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/blob/master/2024/cable1/prog.c">2024/cable1/prog.c source code</a>. Then see
if the <strong>ChatIOCCC</strong> tool can offer any new, or even correct insights
into the code’s obfuscation. :-)</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ioccc.org/2024/howe/index.html">2024/howe</a></li>
</ul>
<p>“<em>Eh</em>”? The source code, with its UTF-8 conforming accent gives you a
polite editor that is more functional an <code>ed(1)</code>.</p>
<p>We invite you to use the program to view the UTF-8 fun in the
<a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/blob/master/2024/howe/prog.c">2024/howe/prog.c source code</a>.</p>
<p><strong>HINT to emacs users</strong>: type <strong>Q</strong> or press <strong>CTRL+C</strong> to exit. 🤓</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ioccc.org/2024/stedolan/index.html">2024/stedolan</a></li>
</ul>
<p>When you view the <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/blob/master/2024/stedolan/prog.c">prog.c source code</a>,
notice magic numbers. This <strong>one liner</strong> packs a significant amount
of obfuscation in only 135 bytes!</p>
<p>Try giving 10 hex digits to standard input of the program. Then try a
different hex digits value. Then feed the MD5 hash of the
<a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/blob/master/2024/stedolan/prog.c">2024/stedolan/prog.c source code</a> and
“<em>C</em>” what happens. :-)</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ioccc.org/2024/endoh1/index.html">2024/endoh1</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/blob/master/2024/endoh1/try.sh">2024/endoh1/try.sh</a> will carry you on
a journey that tests your patience as well as the patience of the C-preprocessor.</p>
<p>Building a 8x8 image requires order of 20 seconds of C-preprocessor
time, when running 6 jobs on 4 CPU cores in parallel. Unfortunately,
with such a tiny image, it is hard to appreciate the image being rendered.</p>
<p>So you might try building a 32x32 form of the image, invoking the
C-preprocessor 1024 times. When using 6 jobs on 4 CPU cores in parallel,
this might take about 5.5 minutes to complete. However, the small image
only gives you a hint of the image being rendered.</p>
<p>If you have the time you might try building a 128x128 image, invoking
the C-preprocessor 16384 times. With 6 jobs on 4 CPU cores in parallel,
this will take about 1.5 hours. At this scale you might consider it
worthwhile to render a more detailed image.</p>
<p>Using 6 jobs on 4 CPU cores in parallel, to build a 512x512 image invoking
the C-preprocessor 262144 times over a period of about 23.5 hours, you
will be given an image with a reasonable amount of detail to appreciate
what is being rendered.</p>
<p>One fun aspect of the <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/blob/master/2024/endoh1/prog.c">2024/endoh1/prog.c source code</a>
is that when it is compiled an executed, the program outputs C code.
That C code, call it <code>rt.c</code> will fail to compile! But that is OK because the C-preprocessor
has enough work to do without bothering the C compiler. :-)</p>
<p>We plan to recognise those who report that they <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/2024/endoh1/index.html#larger">rendered a new record sized image</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ioccc.org/2024/weaver/index.html">2024/weaver</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As the expression goes, “Seeing (and hearing) is believing”: or at least can lead to better understanding of the code. :o)</p>
<p>After studying the <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/blob/master/2024/weaver/prog.c">2024/weaver/prog.c source code</a>,
we suggest you compile and run the program for more information.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ioccc.org/2024/mills/index.html">2024/mills</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This won the “<strong>Prize in ℤ₃</strong>”, but what does that mean? Well,
the “<em>double-struck Z</em>” is <strong>NOT</strong> a reference to a set of integers,
nor is the “<em>double-struck Z subscript 3</em>” a reference to a ring of
3-adic integers. Instead, it is a reference to the 3rd version of a
certain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-machine">virtual machine</a>.</p>
<p>If you use the <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/blob/master/2024/mills/try.sh">2024/mills/try.sh</a> script, you will first be given
an opportunity to view the <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/blob/master/2024/mills/prog.c">2024/mills/prog.c source code</a>.
Then you will be given 10 choices to play.</p>
<p><strong>HINT</strong>: If you select <strong>0</strong>: Try to not be eaten by a Grue when
reading/navigating the twisty mazes of this source code! :-)</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ioccc.org/2024/codemeow/index.html">2024/codemeow</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As you study the <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/blob/master/2024/codemeow/prog.c">2024/codemeow/prog.c source code</a>,
try not to lose track of the forest of obfuscation while tracking down the execution path trees.</p>
<p>We think this code will “grow on you” as the C expression goes just a compiled C code “<em>grows on parse trees</em>”. :-)</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ioccc.org/2024/kurdyukov2/index.html">2024/kurdyukov2</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If seeing is believing, and you believe you understand the
<a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/blob/master/2024/kurdyukov2/prog.c">2024/kurdyukov2/prog.c source code</a>,
then you might be able to see how the code words.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION</strong>: How many of the “<em>magic numbers</em>” in the program do you understand?</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ioccc.org/2024/kurdyukov3/index.html">2024/kurdyukov3</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The prize, “<strong>virtual quietus</strong>”, is a virtual reference to the doom that awaits you when
you run this code: let alone when your try to figure out how the author was able to
encode the virtual machine in under <strong>2.5K bytes</strong> of <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/blob/master/2024/kurdyukov3/prog.c">prog.c source code</a>!</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The implementation runs without sound or mouse
input. You will need reply on your keyboard skills. The
<a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/blob/master/2024/kurdyukov3/try.sh">2024/kurdyukov3/try.sh</a>
demonstration script will give you some useful keyboard hints.</p>

<p>To those who follow the concept of “<em>seeing is believing</em>” will very
likely be “<em>deceived</em>” when they try to see the source in terminal window:</p>
<pre><code>    cat 2024/cable2/prog.c</code></pre>
<p>Viewing the <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/blob/master/2024/cable2/prog.c">prog.c source code</a> in most editors
might suggest that the is something fishy 🐠 with the code.</p>

</ul>
<p>Have you ever wondered would what would happen if you recursively removed
files starting from the root directory? Are you curious what happens when
you launch a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_bomb">fork bomb</a>?
You can safely give those and other scenarios under this virtual machine.</p>
<p>We invite you to explore the <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/blob/master/2024/straadt/prog.c">prog.c source code</a>
to explore this interesting virtual machine implementation. And as a bonus, a
full-fledged C64 emulator is included!</p>

<p>The “<strong>Prize in yil-tas</strong>” provides a hint as to what this marvelous
winning entry is going, provided that you are someone familiar in at
least 3 languages (<strong>hint</strong>: One of them is C, another id English).</p>
<p>The IOCCC is honored to present this entry for your enjoyment and you ponder
the <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/blob/master/2024/ferguson2/prog.c">prog.c source code</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ioccc.org/2024/carlini/index.html">2024/carlini</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The IOCCC has seen a number of winning entries that allow code designed to
run on early Intel processors, however none of them emulate a processor as
early as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_4004">Intel 4004</a>.
Launched in 1971, the 4004 was the core of the first commercially marketed
microprocessor chipset.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/blob/master/2024/carlini/prog.c">2024/carlini/prog.c</a>
code runs rather slow, so patience is required to watch
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_4004#/media/File:Intel_C4004.jpg">4004</a>
code run. This is very understandable when you realize that the
<a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/blob/master/2024/carlini/prog.c">2024/carlini/prog.c</a> is actually
emulating the entire
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_4004#/media/File:Chip_layout_from_the_development_phase_of_the_Intel_4004_from_1971,_the_first_microprocessor_of_the_world_(cropped_and_edited_image).jpg">4004 chip circuit</a>
by computing the output of each gate in a loop, effectively running the CPU and associated RAM/ROM chips!</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Depending on the address of a variable, as not all platforms support
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization">ASLR</a>,
as the single source of pseudo-randomness isn’t a good idea. It’s
much better to mix in other sources of variability (e.g.&nbsp;time, process
ID, etc.) so that subsequent runs will behave differently.</p></li>
<li><p>If a submission’s obfuscation strongly resembles a past IOCCC winning
entry, and the submission’s obfuscation is mainly in the C code source,
then the submission likely to not make it into the final rounds of judging.</p></li>
<li><p>When working with modern C compilers, it’s crucial to explicitly
declare variable and function types. Don’t assume they’ll
automatically default to an <code>int</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Sadly, K&amp;C-style C code does not compile well under modern C compilers.</p></li>
<li><p>A submission that only works under gcc or clang does not work as well
as submissions that can work under either compiler.</p></li>
<li><p>Shrinking an existing open-source program to meet rule 2 size might
be an impressive feat of code shrinking, but it might not be enough to
make it into the final rounds of judging. Originality is key, and this
might not be the most innovative approach.</p></li>
<li><p>If your submission relies on mathematical algorithms, be sure that the
C code that implements the mathematics is well obfuscated.</p></li>
<li><p>Just a friendly reminder that before you upload your submissions,
uncompress the compressed tarball into a different directory. This way,
you can be sure you didn’t miss uploading any important files!</p></li>
<li><p>Using a lot of goto statements to make your code harder to understand
might not help it pass the final rounds of judging.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="encouragement-for-those-who-did-not-win-this-year">Encouragement for those who did not win this year</h3>
<p>We know many of you that submitted to the IOCCC put in a ton of effort
into your submissions for this year’s IOCCC. We can’t just give out
awards to everyone. That would mean taking away from the submissions
that we think are the best and deserve to win.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a final round submission might be good enough to be a
winning IOCCC entry, only to be beaten by a similar, but slightly better
submission. If you think this happened with your submission, consider
submitting an enhanced version to the next IOCCC.</p>
<p><strong>PLEASE DO NOT</strong> give up hope! There are some submissions that have been
submitted with revisions, multiple times before rising to the level of
a winning IOCCC entry. You might also want to try with a different type
of submission altogether for the next IOCCC.</p>
<p>If you’re not planning to improve and resubmit your non-winning entry
for the next IOCCC, you’re welcome to publish it.</p>
<h2 id="on-compiling-and-running-winning-entries">On Compiling and running winning entries</h2>
<p>Some C compilers aren’t as great as they could be. If yours isn’t
working well, you might want to try compiling with an updated version
of clang and/or gcc instead.</p>

<p>The first thing I do every time I need to learn a new codebase is to start drawing the UML diagram of its classes, and usually give up soon after I started. The process of doing it manually is certainly useful, but now with reflections I figure it would be fun to try to generate it instead.</p>



<p>With C++26 reflections[1] the general consensus is that the magnitude of language change is comparable to what happened with C++11. After my little experiment with it, I would cautiously agree. So how does one go about creating a (Plant)UML diagram at compile time? With something like <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/P39K4vYEz">this</a>.</p>



<p>With the spoilers out of the way let’s dig in the details.</p>



<p>P2996[1] introduces a couple of operators, namely lift <code>^^</code> and splice<code> [: :]</code>. The first one “lifts” a type or variable into a “meta” space, and the “splice” one (which imho should have been called “grounding operator”) does the opposite.</p>



<p>The first thing to understand is that regardless of what we apply the lift operator (^^) to, it creates a <code>std::meta::info</code> type. This means that some <code>info</code> objects will be <em>reflections of types</em>, and some will be <em>reflections of values</em>. This creates confusion in my head, as at times one needs to check which <em>kind</em> of <code>info </code>something is, but there are good reasons for this and are well explained in section 2.2 of the paper. With that in mind let’s start coding.</p>



<div><pre data-lang="C++"><code>int main() {
  MyClass s;
  std::string_view dot_graph_uml = make_class_graph&lt;MyClass&gt;();

  std::cout &lt;&lt; dot_graph_uml &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}</code></pre></div>



<p><em>(edit: thanks <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/1mevtwm/c26_reflections_adventures_compile_time_uml/n6cp0w9/" data-type="link" data-id="https://old.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/1mevtwm/c26_reflections_adventures_compile_time_uml/n6cp0w9/"> u/katzdm-cpp</a> for the suggestion to use <code>std::string_view</code>)</em> <s>You’ll notice right away there is an ugly, and seemingly avoidable char pointer. Let’s get back to that later.</s> Not much happens in <code>main()</code> besides us calling function template that is just a wrapper for what we actually care about:</p>



<div><pre data-lang="C++"><code>template&lt;typename U&gt;
consteval std::string_view make_class_graph() { 
  std::string graph = "@startuml \nskinparam linetype ortho \n";

  std::vector&lt;std::meta::info&gt; already_drawn;
  graph += make_class_graph_impl(^^U, already_drawn);
  graph += "@enduml";

  return std::define_static_string(graph);
}</code></pre></div>



<p>Here we see the first interesting thing, something called <code>std::define_static_string</code>[2]. What this does is take what is a compile time <code>std::string</code> and create a string literal, which we can return from a consteval function. If we were to try to return the<code> std::string</code> we would be greeted with the compiler error</p>



<pre><code>&lt;source&gt;:116:24: note: pointer to subobject of heap-allocated object is not a constant expression
/opt/compiler-explorer/clang-bb-p2996-trunk-20250703/bin/../include/c++/v1/__memory/allocator.h:117:13: note: heap allocation performed here
  117 |     return {allocate(__n), __n};</code></pre>



<p>Which makes sense as we cannot expect to create an object we allocate on the heap at compile time, then have this object <em>exist</em> in the heap also at runtime. This is why we end up with a big fat literal string that holds our final UML diagram, which we can do whatever we want with in <code>main()</code>. Looking at the assembly you’ll see the end result:</p>



<div><pre data-lang="C"><code> .asciz  "@startuml \nskinparam linetype ortho \ntogether {\n class \"MyClass\"\n  \"MyClass\"*--\"unsigned int\"\n  \"MyClass\"*--\"unsigned int\"\n  \"MyClass\"*--\"unsigned int\"\n  \"MyClass\"*--\"Nested\"\n  \"MyClass\"-up-|&gt;\"MyBase\"\n}\ntogether {\n class \"Nested\"\n  \"Nested\"*--\"int\"\n  \"Nested\"*--\"int\"\n  \"Nested\"*--\"MyClass\"\n}\ntogether {\n class \"MyBase\"\n  \"MyBase\"*--\"vector&lt;int, allocator&lt;int&gt;&gt;\"\n}\ntogether {\n class \"vector&lt;int, allocator&lt;int&gt;&gt;\"\n}\n@enduml"
</code></pre></div>



<p>Now that we have a magic function that “defines a static string” for us, let’s dig into the actual reflection bits. The first thing to note is what we pass to <code>make_class_graph_impl</code>, which shows the use of the <em>lift</em> operator, <code>^^U</code>. This creates a std::meta::info object that in this case is a <em>reflection of a type</em>. The Impl function itself, as you may have guessed, is meant to be recursive and takes a second argument that we’ll explain later:</p>



<div><pre data-lang="C++"><code>consteval std::string make_class_graph_impl(std::meta::info head, std::vector&lt;std::meta::info&gt;&amp; already_drawn)
{
  [...]

  constexpr auto ctx = std::meta::access_context::current();
  std::string uml_diagram;
    
  uml_diagram += "together {\n class " + add_quotes(display_string_of(head)) + "\n";
  
  const std::string indent = "  ";

  // members
  for (std::meta::info field_info : std::meta::nonstatic_data_members_of(head, ctx))
  {
    uml_diagram += indent +  add_quotes(display_string_of(head)) + composition_arrow + add_quotes(display_string_of(remove_ptr_cv_type_of(field_info))) + "\n";
  }
[...]</code></pre></div>



<p>First let’s talk about the new “context” object: the main paper[1] describes it as “<em>a class that represents a namespace, class, or function from which queries pertaining to access rules may be performed[…]</em>“, and it was introduced in [3] as a mean to resolve the “encapsulation” issue. This context comes in 3 flavours:</p>



<ul>
<li><code>std::meta::access_context::current()</code>: for accessing the public stuff in the current scope</li>



<li>s<code>td::meta::access_context::unprivileged()</code>: for accessing public stuff in the global scope</li>



<li><code>std::meta::access_context::unchecked()</code>: for accessing anything in the global scope</li>
</ul>







<p>After that the interesting things are <code>std::meta::nonstatic_data_members_of(head, ctx)</code>, and <code>std::meta::info::display_string_of(head)</code>. Those are pretty self explanatory, and they do make “metaprogramming” as easy as “programming”!</p>



<p>It gets a bit trickier later, when we have to recurse</p>



<div><pre data-lang="C++"><code>uml_diagram += make_class_graph_impl(remove_ptr_cv_type_of(field_info), already_drawn);</code></pre></div>



<p>Besides the very convenient fact that we can keep track of what we iterated over already simply using a <code>std::vector&lt;std::meta::info&gt;</code>, we do define a custom function with the terrible name of <code>remove_ptr_cv_type_of</code>.</p>



<div><pre data-lang="C++"><code>consteval auto remove_ptr_cv_type_of(std::meta::info r) -&gt; std::meta::info {
  return decay(remove_pointer(is_type(r) ? r : type_of(r)));
}</code></pre></div>



<p>This does what it says on the box, as in our UML we don’t want to distinguish between const/volatile/pointers whathaveyou. The important and interesting bit however is <code>std::meta::is_type(..)</code>. This function tells us what kind of <em>info</em> object we have, as they can be reflections of anything, and therefore we need to test whether or not we have a reflection of a type or a value and apply std::meta::type_of only when necessary. This is a bit of a pain, but imho it’s a small price to pay for Reflections.</p>



<p>That is basically it, we just need to try it out<a href="https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/png/hOx12i8m44Jl-OebHp5_8ANeMVzXQPSsc6vATYCKzTyrO2r2eHTlRsQPcQr5CMaU0XYGg-SH4muGF9DE8q5CsaSm6ZlIdXBS3JG1HS2UfrC1Qs3XdNCsi_YEgGNF-iVZXKIf_R5T7jsZUiiZ2bdpNFjoYSrOoih0jZNlh3VFi_35ahbHep4TFEiUC8JOu4TMrNhFLg8cRlCGNW00" data-type="link" data-id="//www.plantuml.com/plantuml/png/hOx12i8m44Jl-OebHp5_8ANeMVzXQPSsc6vATYCKzTyrO2r2eHTlRsQPcQr5CMaU0XYGg-SH4muGF9DE8q5CsaSm6ZlIdXBS3JG1HS2UfrC1Qs3XdNCsi_YEgGNF-iVZXKIf_R5T7jsZUiiZ2bdpNFjoYSrOoih0jZNlh3VFi_35ahbHep4TFEiUC8JOu4TMrNhFLg8cRlCGNW00"> plotting our PlantUML result</a>, which gets printed out at runtime in this case. </p>

<p dir="auto">There is no web API to easily render complex layouts of text and other content into a <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>. As a result, <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>-based content suffers in accessibilty, internationalization, performance and quality.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Use cases</h3><a id="user-content-use-cases" aria-label="Permalink: Use cases" href="#use-cases"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Styled, Laid Out Content in Canvas.</strong> There’s a strong need for better styled text support in Canvas. Examples include chart components (legend, axes, etc.), rich content boxes in creative tools, and in-game menus.</li>
<li><strong>Accessibility Improvements.</strong> There is currently no guarantee that the canvas fallback content currently used for <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> accessibility always matches the rendered content, and such fallback content can be hard to generate. With this API, elements drawn into the canvas bitmap will match their corresponding canvas fallback.</li>
<li><strong>Composing HTML Elements with Shaders.</strong> A limited set of CSS shaders, such as filter effects, are already available, but there is a desire to use general WebGL shaders with HTML.</li>
<li><strong>HTML Rendering in a 3D Context.</strong> 3D aspects of sites and games need to render rich 2D content into surfaces within a 3D scene.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Proposed solution: <code>layoutsubtree</code>, <code>drawElement</code>, <code>texElement2D</code> and <code>setHitTestRegions</code></h2><a id="user-content-proposed-solution-layoutsubtree-drawelement-texelement2d-and-sethittestregions" aria-label="Permalink: Proposed solution: layoutsubtree, drawElement, texElement2D and setHitTestRegions" href="#proposed-solution-layoutsubtree-drawelement-texelement2d-and-sethittestregions"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>the <code>layoutsubtree</code> attribute on a <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element allows its descendant elements to have layout (*), and causes the direct children of the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> to have a stacking context and become a containing block for all descendants. Descendant elements of the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> still do not paint or hit-test, and are not discovered by UA algorithms like find-in-page.</li>
<li>The <code>CanvasRenderingContext2D.drawElement(element, x, y, options)</code> method renders <code>element</code> and its subtree into a 2D canvas at offset x and y, so long as <code>element</code> is a direct child of the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>. It has no effect if <code>layoutsubtree</code> is not specified on the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>. The <code>options</code> dictionary, if given, has a single option that preserves user privacy in the drawn content, allowing readback or use in WebGL.</li>
<li>The <code>WebGLRenderingContext.texElement2D(..., element)</code> method renders <code>element</code> into a WebGL texture. It has no effect if <code>layoutsubtree</code> is not specified on the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>CanvasRenderingContext2D.setHitTestRegions([{element: ., rect: {x: x, y: y, width: ..., height: ...}, ...])</code> (and <code>WebGLRenderingContext.setHitTestRegions(...)</code>) API takes a list of elements and <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>-relative rects indicating where the
element paints relative to the backing buffer of the canvas. These rects are then used to redirect hit tests for mouse and touch events automatically from the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element to the drawn element.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">(*) Without <code>layoutsubtree</code>, geometry APIs such as <code>getBoundingClientRect()</code> on these elements return an empty rect. They do have computed styles, however, and are keyboard-focusable.</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>drawElement(element ...)</code> takes the CTM (current transform matrix) of the canvas into consideration. The image drawn into the canvas is sized to <code>element</code>'s border box size; element outsize that bounds (including ink and layout overflow) are clipped. The <code>drawElement(element, x, y, dwidth, dheight)</code> variant resizes the image of <code>element</code>'s subtree to <code>dwidth</code> and <code>dheight</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">In an addition, a <code>fireOnEveryPaint</code> option is added to <code>ResizeObserverOptions</code>, allowing script to be notified whenever the drawn elements might have changed their
DOM state and the canvas should be redrawn. The callback to the resize obsever will be called at resize obsever timing, which is after DOM style and layout, but before paint.</p>
<p dir="auto">The same element may be drawn multiple times.</p>
<p dir="auto">Once drawn, the resulting canvas image is static. Subsequent changes to the element will not be reflected in the canvas, so the element must be explicitly redrawn if an author wishes to see the changes.</p>
<p dir="auto">The descendant elements of the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> are considered fallback content used to provide accessibility information.
See <a href="https://github.com/WICG/html-in-canvas/issues/11" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/WICG/html-in-canvas/issues/11/hovercard">Issue#11</a> for an ongoing discussion of accessibility concerns.</p>
<p dir="auto">Offscreen canvas contexts and detached canvases are not supported because drawing DOM content when the canvas is not in the DOM poses technical challenges. See <a href="https://github.com/WICG/html-in-canvas/issues/2" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/WICG/html-in-canvas/issues/2/hovercard">Issue#2</a> for further discussion.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>NOTE</strong>: When using this feature in a DevTrial, take steps to avoid leaking private information, as privacy controls are still in-progress. The <code>allowReadback</code> option must be set to <code>true</code> when an untainted canvas is required; in this mode the content painted into the canvas skips all content which may reveal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data" rel="nofollow">PII</a>). In WebGL rendering, content which may reveal PII is never painted. DevTrial users may wish to start using this option now to avoid disruption when tainting is enabled.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">A surprising figure is celebrating Figma’s successful IPO: Lina Khan, former chair of the Federal Trade Commission.</p>

<p>In a Friday afternoon <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/linamkhan/status/1951361535861043589">post on X</a>, Khan linked to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/stocks/figma-shares-jump-over-200-in-stock-market-debut-605f6212?mod=e2tw">an article</a> about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/31/figmas-stock-soars-in-its-highly-anticipated-ipo-market-cap-instantly-hits-45b/">Figma’s impressive first day of trading</a> and argued the IPO is “a great reminder that letting startups grow into independently successful businesses, rather than be bought up by existing giants, can generate enormous value.”</p>







<p>Khan was alluding to a $20 billion deal for Adobe to acquire Figma that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/18/adobe-figma-europe-regulation-acquisition/">fell through</a> back in 2023. While Adobe cited the lack of a “clear path” to approval from the European Commission and the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority, the acquisition also faced regulatory scrutiny in the United States over concerns that it could prevent Figma from being an “effective competitor” to Adobe.</p>

<p>Khan was FTC chair at the time, leading the agency to challenge Big Tech on fronts including startup acquisitions — to the point that companies tried to avoid this scrutiny with “reverse acqui-hires” in which they hired key team members and licensed technology rather than acquiring startups outright. (The practice <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/19/windsurf-ceo-opens-up-about-very-bleak-mood-before-cognition-deal/">seems to be continuing</a> despite Khan’s departure from the FTC.)</p>

<p>While her aggressive stance led to intense criticism from corners of the tech industry, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/15/ftc-chair-lina-khan-on-startups-scaling-and-innovations-in-potential-law-breaking/">she defended her approach</a> by saying that only a tiny percentage of deals received “a second look” and arguing that founders would ultimately benefit from “a world in which you have six or seven or eight potential suitors” rather than “just one or two.”</p>

<p>And although Khan — who’d been appointed by President Joe Biden — <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-ftc-chair-khan-resign-commission-coming-weeks-2025-01-20/">resigned at the start</a> of the second Trump administration, her comments Friday paint the Figma IPO as a vindication for her approach, calling the IPO “a win for employees, investors, innovation, and the public.”</p>

<p>Of course, Khan’s critics are more likely to see Figma’s success as coming despite regulatory scrutiny, not because of it. For example, Wedbush Security analyst Dan Ives <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/lina-kahn-victory-lap-figma-ipo-after-fighting-adobe-merger-2025-8">told Business Insider</a>, “Figma is a massive success, but it’s because of the company’s innovative growth and not due to the FTC and Kahn.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On July 23, 2025, AWS deleted my 10-year-old account and every byte of data I had stored with them. No warning. No grace period. No recovery options. Just complete digital annihilation.</p>
<p>This is the story of a catastrophic internal mistake at AWS MENA, a 20-day support nightmare where I couldn’t get a straight answer to “Does my data still exist?”, and what it reveals about trusting cloud providers with your data.</p>
<h2 id="the-architecture-that-should-have-protected-me">The Architecture That Should Have Protected Me</h2>
<p>Before anyone says “you put all your eggs in one basket,” let me be clear: I didn’t. I put them in one <em>provider</em>, with what should have been bulletproof redundancy:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multi-region replication</strong> across AWS Europe (completely separate from US infrastructure)</li>
<li><strong>Dead man’s switch</strong> implemented for disaster recovery</li>
<li><strong>Proper backup architecture</strong> following AWS’s own best practices</li>
<li><strong>Segregated encryption keys</strong> stored separately from data</li>
</ul>
<p>The only scenario I hadn’t planned for? AWS itself becoming the extinction event.</p>
<p>Ten years. That’s how long I’d been an AWS customer. A decade of using AWS as my testbed—spinning up instances to validate deployments for the Ruby gems I maintain like capistrano-puma and capistrano-sidekiq. Nothing production-critical, but essential for open-source development.</p>
<p>On my birthday, AWS gave me a present I’ll never forget: proof that no amount of redundancy matters when the provider itself goes rogue.</p>
<h2 id="the-20-day-support-nightmare-a-timeline">The 20-Day Support Nightmare: A Timeline</h2>
<p><strong>July 10</strong>: AWS sends verification request. 5-day deadline (including weekend).</p>
<p><strong>July 14</strong>: Form expired. I contact support. Simple question: “What do you need from me?”</p>
<p><strong>July 16-20</strong>: <strong>Four days of silence.</strong> Then: “We’re escalating to the appropriate team.”</p>
<p><strong>July 20</strong>: New form finally arrives.</p>
<p><strong>July 21</strong>: I submit ID and utility bill (clear PDF). Response time: 10 hours.</p>
<p><strong>July 22</strong>: AWS: “Document unreadable.” The same PDF my bank accepts without question.</p>
<p><strong>July 23</strong>: Account terminated. My birthday gift from AWS.</p>
<p><strong>July 24</strong>: I ask the only question that matters: <strong>“Does my data still exist?”</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>AWS: “Your case is being reviewed by our service team.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I also request temporary read-only access to backup my data. Remember, if I were fraudulent, I would have already copied everything before the verification deadline. They refuse. (Because the data is probably already gone.)</p>
<p><strong>July 28</strong>: After 4 days of template responses, I lose patience:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Me: “Is my data safe? Yes or no?”
AWS: “I want to personally follow up on your case and inform you that we understand the urgency.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>July 29</strong>: I compare their evasion to political deflection:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Me: “You’re answering like I’m Piers Morgan asking ‘Do you condemn October 7th?’ and you reply with historical complexity dating to 1948.”
AWS: “We genuinely value your commitment to following backup best practices.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>July 29</strong>: They finally admit the truth:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AWS: “Because the account verification wasn’t completed by this date, the resources on the account were terminated.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>July 30</strong>: Their final response includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AWS: “We value your feedback. Please share your experience by rating this correspondence.” ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Twenty days. Zero straight answers. Multiple requests for 5-star reviews while my data lay in digital ashes.</p>
<h2 id="the-policy-they-claim-vs-the-reality-they-deliver">The Policy They Claim vs. The Reality They Deliver</h2>
<p>Here’s what AWS’s own documentation says about account closure:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The post-closure period is 90 days—during this time, an account can be reopened and data is retained.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“After 90 days, the account is ‘permanently closed’ and all content—including snapshots and backups—is deleted.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But here’s the catch: I never voluntarily closed my account. AWS suspended it for “verification failure”—a policy grey zone conveniently absent from their public documentation. There’s no published exception stating that verification-suspended accounts bypass the 90-day retention period.</p>
<p>The community standard across cloud providers? 30-90 days retention unless there’s actual fraud or abuse. AWS? Zero days. Zero hours. Zero mercy.</p>
<h2 id="the-payer-complication">The Payer Complication</h2>
<p>AWS blamed the termination on a “third-party payer” issue. An AWS consultant who’d been covering my bills disappeared, citing losses from the FTX collapse. The arrangement had worked fine for almost a year—about $200/month for my testing infrastructure.</p>
<p>When AWS demanded this vanished payer validate himself, I pointed out that I already had my own Wise card on file—the same card I’d used to pay before the payer arrangement, kept active specifically in case the payer disconnected while I was traveling or offline. They refused to simply switch billing back to it for 20 days, citing “privacy” concerns while making me fully responsible for the consequences.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing: This wasn’t about payment. If it were, they would have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Switched billing to my on-file credit card</li>
<li>Suspended services, not deleted data</li>
<li>Provided the 90-day grace period their own docs promise</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead, they used the payer issue as cover for what really happened—their botched internal testing.</p>
<h2 id="the-hypocrisy-runs-deeper">The Hypocrisy Runs Deeper</h2>
<p>The payer wasn’t some random scammer—they were a YC-backed company. I could see this when linking the payment. If AWS MENA’s security is so robust, why did they fail to identify any issues for an entire year?</p>
<p>When I tried to resolve this, AWS demanded I explain:</p>
<ul>
<li>What I use my account for</li>
<li>My future plans</li>
<li>Why I need the services</li>
</ul>
<p>Like I was applying for funding or a promotion. This is a 10-year-old account. I shouldn’t need to justify my existence to use services I’ve been paying for since 2015.</p>
<p>But here’s the real kicker: AWS developers regularly email me asking for help with Ruby issues. No compensation. No AWS credits. Not even a “thank you” in their commits. Just “Hey, can you help us debug this Rails deployment issue?”</p>
<p>So let me get this straight:</p>
<ul>
<li>AWS benefits from my open-source code</li>
<li>AWS engineers ask me for free consulting</li>
<li>AWS makes me explain why I deserve to keep my account</li>
<li>AWS deletes everything when a YC-backed payer (that they failed to vet) disappears</li>
</ul>
<p>And they want me to background check every client? Should I run security clearances on the AWS verification emails too? Because apparently, their own vetting process couldn’t catch whatever the payer did wrong for an entire year.</p>
<h2 id="what-aws-really-destroyed">What AWS Really Destroyed</h2>
<p>Here’s what most people don’t understand: AWS wasn’t just my backup—it was my clean room for open source development.</p>
<p>My desktop is chaos. Always has been. Files everywhere, half-finished projects, experimental code. But I discovered that by copying everything to AWS, starting fresh, and pulling back only what I needed, I could create clean, focused gems. This workflow is how I released:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>BreakerMachines</strong> - Circuit breaker patterns for Ruby</li>
<li><strong>ChronoMachines</strong> - Time-based state machines</li>
<li><strong>RailsLens</strong> - Performance monitoring for Rails</li>
<li>And dozens more</li>
</ul>
<p>These gems save developers hundreds, maybe thousands of hours. They’re used in production systems worldwide. AWS didn’t just delete my data—they destroyed the infrastructure that made these contributions possible.</p>
<p>But it gets worse. Also gone:</p>
<ul>
<li>A complete programming book written in my Chronicles narrative style</li>
<li>Electronics tutorials bridging hardware and software</li>
<li>“Go for Rubyists”—lessons helping Ruby developers transition to Go</li>
<li>Years of unpublished work that could have helped thousands</li>
</ul>
<p>When AWS deleted my account, they didn’t just hurt me. They hurt every developer who uses my gems. Every student who could have learned from those tutorials. Every future contribution that won’t happen because my workflow is destroyed.</p>
<p>The irony? Some of these gems probably run in AWS’s own infrastructure, making their systems more reliable. And they deleted the very environment that created them.</p>
<h2 id="the-theory-how-vs-may-have-killed-my-account">The Theory: How <code>-dry</code> vs <code>--dry</code> May Have Killed My Account</h2>
<p>After my story started circulating, an AWS insider reached out. They were upset, leaving AWS soon, and wanted to share what they knew—specifically because AWS depends on open-source code I’ve written.</p>
<p>According to them, AWS MENA was running some kind of proof of concept on “dormant” and “low-activity” accounts. Multiple accounts were affected, not just mine. Here’s where it gets technical:</p>
<p>The developer running the test typed <code>--dry</code> to execute a dry run—standard practice across modern CLIs:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ruby --version</code></li>
<li><code>npm --version</code></li>
<li><code>bun --version</code></li>
<li><code>terraform --dry-run</code></li>
</ul>
<p>But the internal tool was written in Java. And Java uses single dashes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>java -version</code> (not <code>--version</code>)</li>
<li><code>java -dry</code> (not <code>--dry</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>When you pass <code>--dry</code> to a Java application expecting <code>-dry</code>, it gets ignored. The script executed for real, deleting accounts in production.</p>
<p>The developer did everything right. Java’s 1995-era parameter parsing turned a simulation into an extinction event.</p>
<p>Is this exactly what happened? I can’t prove it. The insider was vague, worried about being identified. But it explains:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why multiple “low-activity” accounts were suddenly flagged</li>
<li>The 4-day delays (scrambling to cover up)</li>
<li>The refusal to answer simple questions</li>
<li>The support agents who admitted they “couldn’t make decisions”</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="aws-mena-why-people-pay-to-avoid-it">AWS MENA: Why People Pay to Avoid It</h2>
<p>This theory gains credibility when you consider the AWS MENA reputation. For years, I’ve watched developers on Reddit and Facebook desperately seeking US or EU billing addresses, willing to pay $100+ premiums to avoid MENA region assignment.</p>
<p>When I asked why, a colleague warned me: “AWS MENA operates differently. They can terminate you randomly.”</p>
<p>I laughed it off. AWS is AWS, right?</p>
<p>The 4-day delay for a simple verification form. The 10-hour response times. The robotic support responses. This wasn’t standard AWS incompetence—this was something else entirely.</p>
<h2 id="the-ultimate-irony-security-became-my-weakness">The Ultimate Irony: Security Became My Weakness</h2>
<p>I’d done everything right. Vault encryption keys stored separately from my main infrastructure. Defense in depth. Zero trust architecture. The works.</p>
<p>My security posture was textbook—protect against compromise by ensuring no single failure could take down everything. What I hadn’t protected against? AWS itself being the single point of failure.</p>
<p>I built a hardened bunker with multiple escape routes, only to have AWS drop a nuke on the entire complex.</p>
<h2 id="what-this-means-for-you">What This Means for You</h2>
<p>You might be thinking, “What are the odds they target me?” But that’s the wrong question. I thought the same thing—with my level of exposure and contributions, surely they could just write my name down and not bother me with stupid verification requests about whether I exist.</p>
<p>But you’re not being targeted—you’re being algorithmically categorized. And if the algorithm decides you’re disposable, you’re gone.</p>
<p>Doesn’t matter if you’re a verified open-source contributor. Doesn’t matter if you’ve been a customer for a decade. If you don’t fit the revenue model, if you don’t engage with support regularly, if your usage patterns look “suspicious” to a poorly trained ML model—you’re just another data point to be optimized away.</p>
<p>Look, I write weird stuff. My documentation style triggers AI safeguards. Take my ActionMCP gem that provides MCP capabilities to Rails—Opus can’t even read the documentation without hanging when its safeguards trigger. Sonnet? No problem. (Try it yourself: github.com/seuros/action_mcp)</p>
<p>If my creative technical writing can confuse one AI but not another, imagine what AWS’s “fraud detection” algorithms see when they look at my account. An anomaly. A pattern that doesn’t fit. Something to be eliminated.</p>
<h2 id="the-only-path-forward-a-broken-promise">The Only Path Forward: A Broken Promise</h2>
<p>After 20 days of appeals, AWS support finally responded with this gem: “Because verification wasn’t completed by the due date, your resources were terminated.”</p>
<p>But here’s the dilemma they’ve created: What if you have petabytes of data? How do you backup a backup? What happens when that backup contains HIPAA-protected information or client data? The whole promise of cloud computing collapses into complexity.</p>
<p>This isn’t a system failure. The architecture and promises are sound. AWS doesn’t lose data—they have backups of backups of backups, stored in vaults that last far longer than the stated 90 days, where no rogue AI script can reach.</p>
<p>What’s happening here is simpler: teams in MENA are trying to cover up a massive fuck-up. Restoring data from those deep vaults would require explanations. Incident reports. Post-mortems. “Why did we have to open the vaults?”</p>
<p>Their entire communication strategy screams: “He’s nobody. He’ll give up soon. We won’t have to report this up the chain.”</p>
<p>But they messed with the wrong developer.</p>
<p>I’m now building a free tool to help people exodus from AWS. Not hosted on AWS, obviously. My clients—representing over $400k/month in AWS billing—have already agreed to migrate to Oracle OCI, Azure, and Google Cloud.</p>
<p>Because if AWS can delete a 10-year customer without blinking, what are they capable of when the stakes are higher?</p>
<h2 id="the-bitter-truth">The Bitter Truth</h2>

































<table><thead><tr><th>What You Give AWS</th><th>What AWS Gives You</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>A decade of loyalty</td><td>Zero-day termination</td></tr><tr><td>Prompt payment history</td><td>20 days of runaround</td></tr><tr><td>Proper documentation</td><td>”Unreadable” rejection</td></tr><tr><td>Open-source contributions</td><td>No consideration whatsoever</td></tr><tr><td>Carefully segregated backups</td><td>Complete data annihilation</td></tr><tr><td>Trust</td><td>Betrayal</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>AWS has clout. They run the internet’s infrastructure. They sponsor conferences, fund open source projects, and position themselves as the reliable backbone of the digital economy.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t excuse digitally executing someone’s decade-old testbed account over a verification form glitch and a bill under $200. This wasn’t my production infrastructure—thankfully—but it was my launch pad for updating other infrastructure. Now I’m spending days rotating encryption keys across multiple systems because my central testing environment vanished.</p>
<h2 id="the-systemic-failure">The Systemic Failure</h2>
<p>This isn’t just about my account. It’s about what happens when:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Regional divisions go rogue</strong>: AWS MENA operating outside global policies</li>
<li><strong>Support becomes theater</strong>: Agents who can only paste templates and ask for 5-star reviews</li>
<li><strong>“Move fast and break things” meets production data</strong>: Internal tools with Java’s 1995 parameter parsing handling customer deletions</li>
<li><strong>No accountability</strong>: 20 days of deflection instead of one honest answer</li>
</ol>
<p>The evidence of dysfunction:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hundreds paying premiums to avoid MENA billing (the market has spoken)</li>
<li>4-day delays for simple forms</li>
<li>Support comparing data recovery questions to geopolitical debates</li>
<li>Automated “please rate us” emails while actively destroying customer data</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-real-cost">The Real Cost</h2>
<p>AWS markets itself as the backbone of the internet, the reliable partner for your infrastructure. They sponsor open-source projects, run re:Invent, and position themselves as developer allies.</p>
<p>But when their internal systems fail—when someone types <code>--dry</code> and Java ignores it—they’ll delete a decade of your work without blinking. Then they’ll spend 20 days gaslighting you about it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, actual malicious accounts hosting phishing sites and crypto scams run for weeks untouched. Because those generate revenue. A low-activity open-source developer testing Ruby gems? Collateral damage.</p>
<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Never trust a single provider</strong>—no matter how many regions you replicate across</li>
<li><strong>“Best practices” mean nothing</strong> when the provider goes rogue</li>
<li><strong>Document everything</strong>—screenshots, emails, correspondence timestamps</li>
<li><strong>The support theater is real</strong>—they literally cannot help you</li>
<li><strong>Have an exit strategy</strong> executable in hours, not days</li>
</ol>
<p>AWS won’t admit their mistake. They won’t acknowledge the rogue proof of concept. They won’t explain why MENA operates differently. They won’t even answer whether your data exists.</p>
<p>But they will ask you to rate their support 5 stars.</p>
<p>The cloud isn’t your friend. It’s a business. And when their business needs conflict with your data’s existence, guess which one wins?</p>
<p>Plan accordingly.</p>
<h2 id="a-personal-note">A Personal Note</h2>
<p>At one point during this ordeal, I hit rock bottom. I was ready to delete everything—yank all my gems from RubyGems, delete the organizations, the websites, everything I’d created. Leave a single message: “AWS killed this.”</p>
<p>It would have made headlines. Caused chaos for thousands of projects. Trended on HN, Reddit, YouTube. But it would have hurt the wrong people—developers who depend on my work, not AWS.</p>
<p>I was alone. Nobody understood the weight of losing a decade of work. But I had ChatGPT, Claude, and Grok to talk to. Every conversation revealed I wasn’t alone in being targeted by AWS—especially MENA. Hundreds of Reddit threads, websites, forums, all telling similar stories.</p>
<p>I tried reaching out to some victims. Some didn’t want to talk about it—the trauma was too fresh. Others said they’d left programming entirely. AWS didn’t just delete their data; they deleted their careers.</p>
<p>As someone with LLI (Low Latent Inhibition), I can’t filter out this trauma like others might. Can’t just switch careers and forget. The raw, unfiltered pain stays with me. I wish I could move on, but I can’t.</p>
<p>Who knows how many people in my situation have been erased from our timeline because of the sadistic behavior of support teams like AWS’s? The whole system is built to hurt—to make you feel small, powerless, unheard. To make you give up. To make you disappear.</p>
<p>To everyone who worked on these AIs, who contributed to their training data—thank you. Without you, this post might have been a very different kind of message.</p>
<p>AWS may have deleted my data, but they didn’t delete my determination to help others avoid this fate.</p>
<p>Build that exodus tool I will.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>Welcome back to The Sunday Morning Post, this newsletter’s weekly rundown of the most interesting and important stuff I’m seeing in science, technology, economics, and beyond. Comments are open. Leave tips, papers, studies, tweets, posts, questions, and graphs in the comments, if you think they’ll serve for future editions.</p><p><span>Euan Ashley has </span><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4llcv2QIXnxKeMzaqRZ1dS" rel="">claimed</a><span> that exercise is the “single most potent medical invention” ever—more broadly effective than any medicine discovered in the natural world or devised in a laboratory. In 2025, this is the sort of rah-rah sentiment about working out that one might associate with a Make America Healthy Again ambassador rather than, say, the chair of medicine at Stanford University. So, what makes Ashley’s claim significant is that he </span><em>is</em><span> the chair of medicine at Stanford University.</span></p><p><span>Last year, Ashley and a large team of scientists conducted an elaborate experiment on the effects of exercise on the mammalian body. In one test, Ashley put rats on tiny treadmills, worked them out for weeks, and cut into them to investigate how their organs and vessels responded to the workout compared to a control group of more sedentary rodents.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-168158155" href="https://www.derekthompson.org/p/the-sunday-morning-post-why-exercise#footnote-1-168158155" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span><span> The results were spectacular. Exercise transformed just about every tissue and molecular system that Ashley and his co-authors studied—not just the muscles and heart, but also the liver, adrenal glands, fat, and immune system. </span></p><p>When I asked Ashley if it was possible to design a drug that mimicked the observed effects of exercise, he was emphatic that, no, this was not possible. The benefits of exercise seem too broad for any one therapy to mimic. To a best approximation, aerobic fitness and weight-training seem to increase our metabolism, improve mitochondrial function, fortify our immune system, reduce inflammation, improve tissue-specific adaptations, and protect against disease.</p><p><span>The latest entry in the Exercise Is Magic file comes from </span><a href="https://www.nejm.org/do/10.1056/NEJMdo008039/full/" rel="">the New England Journal of Medicine</a><span>. In a recent study, 900 cancer patients who had undergone surgery on their advanced colon cancer were randomly assigned to two groups. One group got a “structured exercise program.” They went to behavioral support sessions and attended supervised exercise classes every few weeks for several years. The other group received only basic information about diet and health.</span></p><p>Compared to the control group, the exercise group saw “significantly” more years without cancer, a 7 percentage point increase in the overall survival rate after 8 years, and a dramatic reduction in new primary cancers. Exercise, it seems, doesn’t just prevent disease; it can also save your life after you get sick.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!t4il!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa837333-1baa-463a-9b82-2a0422978694_1282x1254.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!t4il!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa837333-1baa-463a-9b82-2a0422978694_1282x1254.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!t4il!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa837333-1baa-463a-9b82-2a0422978694_1282x1254.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!t4il!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa837333-1baa-463a-9b82-2a0422978694_1282x1254.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!t4il!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa837333-1baa-463a-9b82-2a0422978694_1282x1254.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!t4il!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa837333-1baa-463a-9b82-2a0422978694_1282x1254.jpeg" width="1282" height="1254" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fa837333-1baa-463a-9b82-2a0422978694_1282x1254.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1254,&quot;width&quot;:1282,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:128015,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.derekthompson.org/i/168158155?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa837333-1baa-463a-9b82-2a0422978694_1282x1254.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!t4il!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa837333-1baa-463a-9b82-2a0422978694_1282x1254.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!t4il!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa837333-1baa-463a-9b82-2a0422978694_1282x1254.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!t4il!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa837333-1baa-463a-9b82-2a0422978694_1282x1254.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!t4il!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa837333-1baa-463a-9b82-2a0422978694_1282x1254.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>The author Daniel Lieberman </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Exercised-Something-Evolved-Healthy-Rewarding/dp/052543478X/ref=asc_df_052543478X?mcid=1734c528e04d3fb5b8f542ded7df910a&amp;hvocijid=17701023827466789008-052543478X-&amp;hvexpln=73&amp;tag=hyprod-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=721245378154&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=17701023827466789008&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9061285&amp;hvtargid=pla-2281435177818&amp;psc=1" rel="">has put it well</a><span>: Exercise is healthy and rewarding even though it’s something we never evolved to do. To adapt to the physical ease of the modern world, people invented a variety of weight-resistant devices and bodily movements that allow today’s population to simulate the arduous tasks that were once necessary to make it through a life, and this strange pantomime of physical stress seems to do more for us at a molecular level than any therapy or intervention in the history of medicine.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-168158155" href="https://www.derekthompson.org/p/the-sunday-morning-post-why-exercise#footnote-2-168158155" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span><span> </span></p><p>Soon after overseeing cuts to more than 80 percent of programs at the United States Agency for International Development, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in remarks in July that USAID “has little to show since the end of the Cold War.” In the field of global health, this analysis may be off by about 100 million.</p><p><span>In June, The Lancet </span><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01186-9/fulltext" rel="">published</a><span> an evaluation of 20 years of USAID funding by a team of global researchers from Brazil, Spain, Mozambique, and the United States. They calculated that US global health and development spending has spared about 90 million deaths in low-income countries, including:</span></p><ul><li><p>25 million lives saved from HIV/AIDS</p></li><li><p>11 million from diarrheal disease</p></li><li><p>9 million from lower respiratory infections</p></li><li><p>9 million from "neglected" tropical diseases, such as dengue and river blindness</p></li><li><p>8 million from malaria</p></li><li><p>5 million from tuberculosis</p></li><li><p>2 million from nutritional deficiencies</p></li></ul><p>All this was achieved with a program that accounts for about 0.8 percent of the federal budget and about 1/400th of America’s total national spending. This is a staggering return on moral investment.</p><p>When I think about the case for global health spending, I think about the first days of my life. Nobody chooses how they come into the world. I achieved nothing to earn my birth in a hospital in Washington, D.C., as opposed to a clinic in Maputo or Kinshasa, or to deserve the automatic guarantee of American citizenship upon my first breath of air. That I was born in the capital of the world’s richest country is one of the greatest strokes of luck in my life—a pure accident of timing and gametes. There is no way to pay back this good fortune, and wallowing in guilt over it would do nothing, either. The quiet miracle of charity and global aid is that the uneven distribution of global wealth creates an asymmetry by which relatively trivial amounts of money from the rich can prevent immense suffering and death among the poor. Interventions as simple as bed nets, antiretroviral therapies for HIV/AIDS, and the distribution of commonplace vaccines and therapies in impoverished rural areas can save an astonishing number of lives, while costing a rich country an amount of money that makes practically no difference to any their citizen’s day-to-day. </p><p>Americans are blessed to be in possession of a kind of sorcerer’s stone—a bit of policy alchemy that can transform one-four hundredth of our spending into 100 million saved lives, in less than half a century. I think we should use it.</p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>Fact-checkers may have a new tool in the fight against misinformation.</span></p><p><span>A team of Cornell researchers has developed a way to “watermark” light in videos, which they can use to detect if video is fake or has been manipulated.</span></p><p><span>The idea is to hide information in&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN">nearly-invisible fluctuations&nbsp;</span><span>of lighting at important events and locations, such as interviews and press conferences or even entire buildings, like the United Nations Headquarters. These fluctuations are designed to go unnoticed by humans, but are recorded as a hidden watermark in any video captured under the special lighting, which could be programmed into computer screens, photography lamps and built-in lighting. Each watermarked light source has a secret code that can be used to check for the corresponding watermark in the video and reveal any malicious editing.</span></p><p><span>Peter Michael, a graduate student in the field of computer science who led the work, will present the study, “</span><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3742892"><span lang="EN-US">Noise-Coded Illumination for Forensic and Photometric Video</span></a><span>,” on Aug. 10 at SIGGRAPH 2025 in Vancouver, British Columbia.</span></p><p><span>Editing video footage in a misleading way is nothing new.

<p><span>“Video used to be treated as a source of truth, but that’s no longer an assumption we can make,” said&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/abe/group/"><span lang="EN-US">Abe Davis</span></a><span>, assistant professor of computer science in the Cornell Ann S. Bowers College of Computing and Information Science, who first conceived of the idea. “Now you can pretty much create video of whatever you want. That can be fun, but also problematic, because it’s only getting harder to tell what’s real.”</span></p><p><span>To address these concerns, researchers had previously designed techniques to watermark digital video files directly, with tiny changes to specific pixels that can be used to identify unmanipulated footage or tell if a video was created by AI. However, these approaches depend on the video creator using a specific camera or AI model – a level of compliance that may be unrealistic to expect from potential bad actors.</span></p><p><span>By embedding the code in the lighting, the new method ensures that any real video of the subject contains the secret watermark, regardless of who captured it. The team showed that programmable light sources, like computer screens and certain types of room lighting, can be coded with a small piece of software, while older lights, like many off-the-shelf lamps, can be coded by attaching a small computer chip about the size of a postage stamp.

<p>Your code using the <code>/o</code> modifier</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Hi there! Do you like Regex? Do you like performance? Do you like creating confounding bugs for yourself rooted in the mechanics of the Ruby VM itself?</p>
<p>If you said yes to all of the above, have I got a feature for you!</p>
<p>But first, let’s start with a story.</p>
<h3 id="the-cliffs-of-insanity">The cliffs of insanity</h3>
<p>I was recently reviewing some code, and part of the functionality was about matching. A class took an array of strings, and you could call a method to see if an input matched part of any of the strings. Stripped down, it was effectively the following code:</p>
<pre><code>class Matcher
  def initialize(matchables)
    @matchables = matchables
  end

  def matches_any?(input)
    @matchables.any? { |m| m.match?(/#{input}/io) }
  end
end
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>I <em>know</em> there are some of you reading this code and thinking “does this really need a regex?”, “couldn’t it just use <code>include?</code> and some downcasing?”, “does this even need to exist?”, etc, etc. I see you, I hear you, I’d probably think the same, and I <em>promise</em> you the specifics of this method aren’t that important.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Functionally, the code looked <em>ok</em> to me. I knew what <code>/i</code> was (a regex in <a href="https://ruby-doc.org/3.4.1/Regexp.html#class-Regexp-label-Case-Insensitive+Mode">case-insensitive mode</a>), but I didn’t recognize <code>/o</code>. It didn’t seem critically important to lookup yet. Tests were not exhaustive but were green, and so I went to run the code in a console:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ruby"><span>Matcher</span><span>.</span>new(<span>[</span><span>"Ruby!"</span><span>]</span>)<span>.</span>matches_any?(<span>"ruby"</span>)
<span>=&gt;</span> <span>true</span>
<span>Matcher</span><span>.</span>new(<span>[</span><span>"Ruby!"</span><span>]</span>)<span>.</span>matches_any?(<span>"something else"</span>)
<span>=&gt;</span> <span>true</span>
<span>Matcher</span><span>.</span>new(<span>[</span><span>"Ruby!"</span><span>]</span>)<span>.</span>matches_any?(<span>"javascript"</span>)
<span>=&gt;</span> <span>true</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Well, that seemed broken. Assuming it was a bug, I looked at the code to see what was wrong. But nothing stuck out. The code <em>seemed</em> ok, and simple:</p>
<pre><code>@matchables.any? |m| m.match?(/#{input/io) }
</code></pre>
<p>So I deconstructed the code and ran it directly, outside the class:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ruby"><span>[</span><span>"Ruby!"</span><span>].</span>any? { <span>|</span>m<span>|</span> m<span>.</span>match?(<span>/ruby/io</span>) }
<span>=&gt;</span> <span>true</span>
<span>[</span><span>"Ruby!"</span><span>].</span>any? { <span>|</span>m<span>|</span> m<span>.</span>match?(<span>/something else/io</span>) }
<span>=&gt;</span> <span>false</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Even weirder. Run directly, it ran as expected. What if I started a new console, and ran the original class in a different order?</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ruby"><span>Matcher</span><span>.</span>new(<span>[</span><span>"Ruby!"</span><span>]</span>)<span>.</span>matches_any?(<span>"something else"</span>)
<span>=&gt;</span> <span>false</span>
<span>Matcher</span><span>.</span>new(<span>[</span><span>"Ruby!"</span><span>]</span>)<span>.</span>matches_any?(<span>"ruby"</span>)
<span>=&gt;</span> <span>false</span>
<span>Matcher</span><span>.</span>new(<span>[</span><span>"something else"</span><span>]</span>)<span>.</span>matches_any?(<span>"Ruby!"</span>)
<span>=&gt;</span> <span>true</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Well, that was interesting. It seems like whatever value I sent to <code>matches_any?</code> was cached for every run after that point, even for <em>brand new objects</em>.</p>
<p>I looked through the class again. There was no weird memoization. No class-level variables. No thread locals. I was instantiating the class each time I ran <code>matches_any?</code>. I was out of ideas for the predictable things that cause unpredictable results. What else was there?</p>
<h3 id="o-the-humanity">/o the humanity!</h3>
<p>With nothing else to investigate, I finally looked up the docs for what the <code>/o</code> regex modifier does. <code>/o</code> is referred to as “Interpolation mode”, which sounded pretty harmless. The Ruby docs have a succinct section on the expected behavior: <a href="https://ruby-doc.org/3.4.1/Regexp.html#class-Regexp-label-Interpolation+Mode">https://ruby-doc.org/3.4.1/Regexp.html#class-Regexp-label-Interpolation+Mode</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Modifier o means that the first time a literal regexp with interpolations is encountered, the generated Regexp object is saved and used for all future evaluations of that literal regexp</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just reading that, I still wasn’t sure I’d expect what I was seeing. It almost sounded like internally Ruby would cache <em>each</em> different interpolation that comes through. As if it would maybe reuse an internal regex if the same string value was interpolated. They provide a code example that makes it a little clearer:</p>
<pre><code>def letters; sleep 5; /[A-Z][a-z]/; end
words = %w[abc def xyz]
start = Time.now
words.each {|word| word.match(/\A[#{letters}]+\z/) }
Time.now - start # =&gt; 15.0174892

start = Time.now
words.each {|word| word.match(/\A[#{letters}]+\z/o) }
Time.now - start # =&gt; 5.0010866
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>letters</code> method in the first example is called three times. One time for each iteration, as expected, taking 15 seconds total.</p>
<p>In the second example, the code iterates three times, but the <code>letters</code> method is called <em>once</em>, taking 5 seconds total.</p>
<p>Knowing that, I went back to the original code with new eyes:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ruby"><span>class</span> <span>Matcher</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>initialize</span>(matchables)
    @matchables <span>=</span> matchables
  <span>end</span>
	
  <span>def</span> <span>matches_any?</span>(input)
    @matchables<span>.</span>any? { <span>|</span>m<span>|</span>
      m<span>.</span>match?(
        <span>/</span><span>#{</span>input<span>}</span><span>/io</span> <span># This is run once, _ever_</span>
      )
    }
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>What that meant for me is that the regular expression inside of <code>matches_any?</code> was interpolating the <em>first value it <strong>ever</strong> receives</em>. Past that point the regex <em>never interpolated another value</em>.</p>
<p>As it turned out, the developer had read about it as a potential regex optimization. It seemed harmless enough, so they added it. Now that I knew why I was hitting the issue, I removed the <code>/o</code> and everything started working properly.</p>
<p>But it still was not clear to me <em>how</em> this was possible. What in the world is Ruby doing internally? Let’s figure it out together.</p>
<h3 id="inside-the-vm">Inside the VM</h3>
<p>Sometimes the only way to understand a behavior in Ruby is to drop a bit lower. Let’s disassemble the code into Ruby VM byte code, to see if it gives us any clues. I’ll use the <code>DATA</code> feature to be able to put it into a script directly (you can find more about <a href="https://ruby-doc.org/3.4.1/Object.html#DATA">that syntax here</a>).</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ruby">puts <span>RubyVM</span><span>::</span><span>InstructionSequence</span><span>.</span>compile(<span>DATA</span><span>.</span>read)<span>.</span>disassemble
	
<span>__END__
</span><span>class Matcher
</span><span>  def initialize(matchables)
</span><span>    @matchables = matchables
</span><span>  end
</span><span>	
</span><span>  def matches_any?(input)
</span><span>    @matchables.any? { |m| m.match?(/#{input}/io) }
</span><span>  end
</span><span>end
</span></code></pre></div><p>There are a bunch of other instructions you’ll see if you run that code, but we’ll focus on the instructions specific to the block in the <code>matches_any?</code> method:</p>
<pre><code># { |m| m.match?(/#{input/io) }

== disasm: #&lt;ISeq:block in matches_any?@&lt;compiled&gt;:7 (7,21)-(7,51)&gt;
local table (size: 1, argc: 1 [opts: 0, rest: -1, post: 0, block: -1, kw: -1@-1, kwrest: -1])
[ 1] m@0&lt;AmbiguousArg&gt;
0000 getlocal_WC_0                          m@0                       (   7)[LiBc]
0002 once                                   block (2 levels) in matches_any?, &lt;is:0&gt;
0005 opt_send_without_block                 &lt;calldata!mid:match?, argc:1, ARGS_SIMPLE&gt;
0007 leave                                  [Br]
</code></pre>
<p>It describes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting local variable <code>m</code></li>
<li>Running the… <code>once</code> instruction?</li>
<li>Calling <code>m</code> with <code>opt_send_without_block</code> with a method id (<code>mid</code>) of <code>match?</code></li>
<li>Then <code>leave</code>ing.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these instructions are <em>very</em> common in the Ruby VM. All except one - the <code>once</code> instruction. I’ve never heard of that!</p>
<p>What is <code>once</code>? It can’t exist almost solely for the purposes of this extremely strange regex modifier, can it? Surely this modifier is not built into the very <em>bones</em> of Ruby?</p>
<h3 id="once-upon-a-time"><code>once</code> upon a time</h3>
<p>If you are ever curious to know how Ruby VM instructions get interpreted in CRuby, there is a central file to all of it called <code>insns.def</code>. It contains all of the available YARV (Yet Another Ruby VM) instructions in a C-esque format which is compiled into an actual C file as part of building the language.</p>
<p>In normal program execution, without JIT optimizations applied (like YJIT, ZJIT, MJIT), you can trace how each instruction is executed by reading <code>insns.def</code>. Let’s look at the <code>once</code> definition to see what kind of dark magic is being invoked.</p>
<pre><code>/* run iseq only once */
DEFINE_INSN
once
(ISEQ iseq, ISE ise)
()
(VALUE val)
{
    val = vm_once_dispatch(ec, iseq, ise);
}
</code></pre>
<p>In essence it’s very simple - it takes the instruction and runs it using <code>vm_once_dispatch</code>. <code>iseq</code> is the instruction sequence, and <code>ise</code> is an “Inline Storage Entry”, which is a place to cache an instruction result. What does <code>vm_once_dispatch</code> do?</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="c"><span>static</span> VALUE
<span>vm_once_dispatch</span>(rb_execution_context_t <span>*</span>ec, ISEQ iseq, ISE is)
{
    rb_thread_t <span>*</span>th <span>=</span> rb_ec_thread_ptr(ec);
    rb_thread_t <span>*</span><span>const</span> RUNNING_THREAD_ONCE_DONE <span>=</span> (rb_thread_t <span>*</span>)(<span>0x1</span>);
	
  again:
    <span>if</span> (is<span>-&gt;</span>once.running_thread <span>==</span> RUNNING_THREAD_ONCE_DONE) {
        <span>return</span> is<span>-&gt;</span>once.value;
    }
    <span>else</span> <span>if</span> (is<span>-&gt;</span>once.running_thread <span>==</span> NULL) {
        VALUE val;
        is<span>-&gt;</span>once.running_thread <span>=</span> th;
        val <span>=</span> rb_ensure(vm_once_exec, (VALUE)iseq, vm_once_clear, (VALUE)is);
        <span>// ... skipped ...
</span><span></span>        is<span>-&gt;</span>once.running_thread <span>=</span> RUNNING_THREAD_ONCE_DONE; <span>/* success */</span>
        <span>return</span> val;
    }
    <span>else</span> <span>if</span> (is<span>-&gt;</span>once.running_thread <span>==</span> th) {
        <span>/* recursive once */</span>
        <span>return</span> vm_once_exec((VALUE)iseq);
    }
    <span>else</span> {
        <span>/* waiting for finish */</span>
        RUBY_VM_CHECK_INTS(ec);
        rb_thread_schedule();
        <span>goto</span> again;
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>It’s a little daunting at first look, but broken down it’s just some simple if statements:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>is-&gt;once.running_thread == RUNNING_THREAD_ONCE_DONE</code><br>
If the instruction cache is set to <code>RUNNING_THREAD_ONCE_DONE</code> (a flag to identify being done vs pointing at a thread), it returns its cached value. Forever.</li>
<li><code>is-&gt;once.running_thread == NULL</code><br>
If there is no running thread, congratulations! Your thread is the winner! You get to decide what value gets cached! Every other thread trying to run this instruction will wait until you have produced a value (by calling <code>vm_once_exec</code>), then use whatever value you produced. Forever.</li>
<li><code>is-&gt;once.running_thread == th</code><br>
If there is a running thread set, and it’s the current thread, we’re in a recursive <code>once</code> (terrifying…)</li>
<li>Otherwise you are a different thread, and you have to wait. You’ll keep checking for a value immediately, or get rescheduled and check it a little later (once some other threads have been given a slice of time)</li>
</ol>
<p>We’ve broken down the logic. Now let’s break down the implications.</p>
<ol>
<li>If you use <code>/o</code> in your regex, the content of the regex will be evaluated <em>once</em>, <strong>ever</strong>. Even if it’s inside of an instance method. Even if it’s inside of a loop with a thousand iterations. It will <em>never</em> be evaluated again. That’s the content you’ve got for your regex. This is why the code I was reviewing was so confusing - even though it lived in an object, and was only created local to that method - it <strong>implicitly created a constant, immutable value</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now we can understand how the original code worked, by evaluating it relative to how the CRuby internals work. The first call we have no value set - past that point we will always use the value literally cached inside of the VM itself:</p>
<pre><code># We haven't run the code yet, so in our starting state:
#   is-&gt;once.running_thread == NULL
#   m.match?(/#{input}/io)
&gt; Matcher.new(["Ruby!"]).matches_any?("something else")
# Now we've run the code once, we're done!
#   is-&gt;once.running_thread == RUNNING_THREAD_ONCE_DONE
#   m.match?(/something else/io)

&gt; Matcher.new(["Ruby!"]).matches_any?("ruby")
#   is-&gt;once.running_thread == RUNNING_THREAD_ONCE_DONE
#   m.match?(/something else/io)

&gt; Matcher.new(["something else"]).matches_any?("Ruby!")
#   is-&gt;once.running_thread == RUNNING_THREAD_ONCE_DONE
#   m.match?(/something else/io)
</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>If the code has not been run yet, you’re in the starting state of <code>is-&gt;once.running_thread == NULL</code>. This means two things. One is clear - the first code to run this gets to determine the value set. Two is a little less clear - it is non-deterministic what value will win!</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’ve read any of <a href="https://jpcamara.com/2024/06/04/your-ruby-programs.html">my series on Ruby concurrency</a>, you’ll know I love a good thread non-determinism example. Here we create a method containing an “interpolation mode” regex. Then we create five threads, and call the method from each thread. To introduce some context switching, we sleep for random amounts (this could also be caused by IO, or long-running code, alternatively):</p>
<pre><code>def once_and_for_all(input)
  /#{input}/o
end

5.times.map do |i|
  Thread.new { sleep(rand); p once_and_for_all(i) }
end.map(&amp;:join)

# Run it once, it prints /3/ 5 times
# Run it again, it prints /1/ 5 times
# Run it again...
</code></pre>
<p>In my first run, I see the regex <code>/3/</code> printed 5 times. Each run gave me a different result. Run this code several times and you will likely see a different value printed each time. It may repeat at times, but there will be no consistency.</p>
<p>Quite the behavior! This is pretty close to being a <a href="https://jpcamara.com/2024/06/04/your-ruby-programs.html#heisenbugs">Heisenbug</a>. Non-determinism at its finest.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>The code has been run already, but now it’s being run again before being set as <code>RUNNING_THREAD_ONCE_DONE</code>: <code>is-&gt;once.running_thread == th</code>. This can only happen within the same thread, and it’s there to handle <em>recursion</em>. It’s hard to imagine using the <code>/o</code> at all, let alone <em>recursively</em>. If you were to do that I’d only have one question for you: “Who hurt you?”</li>
</ol>
<p>But let’s do the damn thing. Here’s a recursive case of the <code>/o</code> modifier. Heaven help us.</p>
<pre><code>def recursive_regex(n)
  puts "Evaluating regex for n=#{n}"
  if n &gt; 0
    /#{recursive_regex(n - 1)}/o # This calls itself recursively
  else
    "base"
  end
end

recursive_regex(5)
# Evaluating regex for n=5
# Evaluating regex for n=4
# Evaluating regex for n=3
# Evaluating regex for n=2
# Evaluating regex for n=1
# Evaluating regex for n=0

recursive_regex(5)
# Evaluating regex for n=5

# Call it with whatever value you want, it's never running the method recursively again.
recursive_regex(500)
# Evaluating regex for n=500
</code></pre>
<p>I promise it hurt me more to write that than it did for you to read it.</p>
<p>This example does bring up an interesting point though! Our examples so far have been simple values interpolated into the regex. In this case, we’re calling a method and it is still only being evaluated once. The operation you run in the interpolation is irrelevant - whatever is interpolated will never be run again with the <code>/o</code> modifier.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>If none of the other conditions are met, it means the interpolation is being evaluated by a different thread. All we can do here is wait to see what the value is.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the same concept as the threading example, but this is about the threads that lose the race. The most interesting part here is that it means this interpolation is guaranteed to be thread safe in CRuby (at least in the sense that other threads are locked out of it, not that you get a deterministic result). That will actually matter a little later, if you can believe it.</p>
<h3 id="why-does-it-exist">Why does it exist?</h3>
<p>I didn’t find a clear origin of this modifier. But it’s been around for 20+ years. It’s likely been around almost as long as Ruby itself. Matz, you scoundrel, you.</p>
<p>Shockingly, every other forum or blog post I found in relation to the <code>/o</code> modifier exclusively spoke about the performance benefits of it. I didn’t find any warnings at all. But mostly I found it used in a scripting context. In a single, simple script run, <em>maybe</em> you’re safe. But the downside seems way worse than any potential upside. If you really need a speed boost - just cache the regex yourself?</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ruby">interpolated_once <span>=</span> <span>/</span><span>#{</span><span>ARGV</span><span>.</span>first<span>}</span><span>/</span>
interpolated_once<span>.</span>match?(<span>"a string"</span>)
interpolated_once<span>.</span>match?(<span>"a string 2"</span>)
interpolated_once<span>.</span>match?(<span>"a string 3"</span>)
<span># Just as performant as /o?</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The earliest reference I could find to the existence of a <code>/o</code> modifier in regex was in a <a href="https://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=256053">2003 post on a <strong>Perl</strong> forum</a>. Based on this, I’m guessing Ruby borrowed it from Perl. Even in 2003, the prevailing wisdom was already clear:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The best heuristic is: Never use <code>/o</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree with that 2003 Perl person. You don’t need it. You should not use it. Step away from the modifier, and no one has to get hurt.</p>
<h3 id="ill-take-your-once-and-raise-you">I’ll take your <code>once</code>, and raise you…</h3>
<p>We’re all having fun here, right? Should we take this confounding modifier, and muddy things a bit more?</p>
<p>There <em>is</em> actually a way to force the <code>/o</code> modifier to re-evaluate.</p>
<p><em>hushed whispers!</em></p>
<p><em>someone in the back of the room faints!</em></p>
<p>I stumbled upon it because I was testing this code in a Rails console. I found that every time I called <code>reload!</code>, I was able to test my method from scratch again. Why would that be?</p>
<p>It’s because when you <code>reload!</code>, all of your code is re-evaluated by Ruby. And when it gets re-evaluated, you get new bytecode, and a new cache! Take this for instance:</p>
<pre><code>def one_time(input)
  /#{input}/o
end

p one_time("hi there!")

def one_time(input)
  /#{input}/o
end

p one_time("how are you?")
# /hi there!/
# /how are you?/
</code></pre>
<p>Even though we used the <code>/o</code> modifier, we were able to re-evaluate it. That’s because we overrode our <code>one_time</code> implementation, which gave us a new <code>once</code> cache.</p>
<p>This matters because it means you can’t even <em>truly</em> guarantee your <code>/o</code> regex will only be run once. If a piece of monkey patch code gets loaded and overrides your method, you will get even <em>more</em> non-deterministic behavior.</p>

<p>In a moment of pure serendipity, the day after I started writing this post I happened to read Jared Norman’s <a href="https://jardo.dev/code-reloading-for-rack-apps">Code Reloading for Rack Apps</a>. The article teaches you how to build the same kind of code reloading Rails has, but in a standalone Rack application. You should give it a read.</p>
<p>In it, he creates a class called <code>Once</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This class let’s you create an object that encapsulates a bit of code and only ever lets it run once, even if it’s called across multiple threads.</p>
<p>-Jared Norman</p>
</blockquote>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ruby"><span>class</span> <span>Once</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>initialize</span>(<span>&amp;</span>block)

<span># =&gt; I should only happen once</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Any thread attempting to run this code will block on the <code>@mutex.synchronize</code>. It runs <code>@block.call</code>, then at the end of the <code>synchronize</code> block, the <code>@mutex</code> is set to <code>nil</code>. This means that after the first thread, every other thread either exits early because <code>@mutex</code> is <code>nil</code>, or never runs the <code>synchronize</code> block at all because of the safe-nav. Makes sense!</p>
<p>As if I was destined to read this by some kind of trickster regex god, what did I see at the end of the article? A reimplementation of his <code>Once</code> class using the <code>/o</code> modifier!</p>
<p>A veritable devil on Jared’s shoulder, <a href="https://www.johnhawthorn.com/">John Hawthorn</a> gave him the idea. It would make sense that John, a Ruby internals wizard, would suggest such a thing. Then Jared, author of <a href="https://jardo.dev/advent-of-criminally-bad-ruby-code">Advent of Criminally Bad Ruby Code</a>, would actually decide to include it.</p>
<p>Here is their ingenious abomination.</p>
<pre><code>class Once
  def initialize(&amp;block)
    @block = block
  end

  def call
    /#{@block.call}/o # THE HORROR
  end
end

o = Once.new do
  puts "I should only happen once"
end

100.times.map { Thread.new { o.call } }.each(&amp;:join)
# =&gt; I should only happen once
</code></pre>
<p>Using <code>/o</code>, the code examples still behave correctly and only run once despite the many threads attempting to run it.</p>
<p>It does, however, have a fatal flaw in comparison to the original code. Can you guess it?</p>
<p>Let’s demonstrate by creating multiple instances:</p>
<pre><code>o1 = Once.new { puts "I should only happen once 1" }
o2 = Once.new { puts "I should only happen once 2" }
o3 = Once.new { puts "I should only happen once 3" }

100.times.map { Thread.new { o1.call } }.each(&amp;:join)
100.times.map { Thread.new { o2.call } }.each(&amp;:join)
100.times.map { Thread.new { o3.call } }.each(&amp;:join)
</code></pre>
<p>In the original, mutex based implementation, we’d see the following:</p>
<pre><code># =&gt; I should only happen once 1
# =&gt; I should only happen once 2
# =&gt; I should only happen once 3
</code></pre>
<p>In the <code>/o</code> based implementation, we see this:</p>
<pre><code># =&gt; I should only happen once 1
</code></pre>
<p>Because of the instruction-level caching, we can only have <em>one</em> result from <code>Once#call</code>, <strong>ever</strong>. A class that literally can only be run reliably a <em>single</em> time. “Once”, indeed.</p>
<p>It’s probably more efficient than the mutex approach and <strong>maybe</strong> in some bizarro world where you truly needed a piece of code to be thread safe and lazy evaluated and as efficient up front as possible and only ever run once… maybe…</p>
<p>No… I cannot condone it - <strong><em>don’t do it!</em></strong></p>
<p>Side note: Jared also has an excellent podcast called <a href="https://shows.acast.com/dead-code">Dead Code</a>, with loads of episodes with fantastic guests. I went on to <a href="https://shows.acast.com/dead-code/episodes/violent-sleep-of-concurrency">speak about concurrency - give it a listen!</a></p>
<h3 id="this-is-the-end">This is the <code>END</code></h3>
<p>Earlier, I said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is <code>once</code>? It can’t exist almost solely for the purposes of this extremely strange regex modifier, can it? Surely this modifier is not built into the very <em>bones</em> of Ruby?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the truth is, <code>/o</code> is not the <em>only</em> reason the <code>once</code> instruction exists. It took a little digging, but I found another piece of Ruby code that uses <code>once</code> - the <a href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.4/syntax/miscellaneous_rdoc.html#label-BEGIN+and+END"><code>END</code> language sytax</a>. I was surprised to find that <code>END</code> existed! I had never heard of it or used it before.</p>
<p>Not to be confused with the <code>end</code> keyword that closes out blocks, <code>END</code> defines a block that is run at the end of the Ruby program. For instance:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ruby"><span>END</span> { puts <span>"do this last please"</span> }
puts <span>"1"</span>
puts <span>"2"</span>
	
<span># =&gt; 1</span>
<span># =&gt; 2</span>
<span># =&gt; do this last please</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Note that if you run this code in <code>irb</code>, the <code>END</code> block will not run until you exit. <code>irb</code> is just a Ruby program, and it doesn’t <code>END</code> until <code>irb</code> is exited.</p>
<p>If you disassemble this code, we’ll see a familiar instruction:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="ruby">puts <span>RubyVM</span><span>::</span><span>InstructionSequence</span><span>.</span>compile(<span>DATA</span><span>.</span>read)<span>.</span>disassemble
	
<span>__END__
</span><span>END { puts "do this last please" }
</span><span>puts "1"
</span><span>puts "2"
</span><span>	
</span><span># == disasm: #&lt;ISeq:&lt;compiled&gt;@&lt;compiled&gt;:1 (1,0)-(4,8)&gt;
</span><span># 0000 once          block in &lt;compiled&gt;, &lt;is:0&gt;(   2)
</span></code></pre></div><p>So the <code>END</code> block, but not the <code>end</code> of a block, uses the <code>once</code> instruction, an instruction that is used twice in Ruby. An appropriately confusing close to an article about a fascinating feature I think you should never use - the <code>/o</code> modifier.</p>

<p>On January 31, 2024, I received a call at 4am from a strange number. Normally, I keep my phone on vibrate overnight, but this number kept calling repeatedly. Eventually, I woke up and answered the phone. The caller said, “Adam? This is Adam, right? This is Jack, a friend of your dad. I’m sorry to call so early, but I have some distressing news.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/dia/l/docinsure?wtm_id=307698&amp;wtm_pt=dia&amp;wtm_lt=l" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="250" height="250" src="https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Doc-Insure.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Doc-Insure.jpg 250w, https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Doc-Insure-238x238.jpg 238w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"></a></p>
<p>Jack went on to tell me that the police were taking my dad to the local hospital’s emergency department. Over the next few hours, we pieced together the story. My dad had wandered out of his house the night before, presumably to go for a walk. It started raining, and he became disoriented, unable to find his way home. He found a house with an unlocked door and went inside. He fell asleep in a spare bedroom. When he woke early the next morning, he became frustrated and confused by his unfamiliar surroundings.</p>
<p>The couple who lived there found him wandering in their kitchen. After the initial shock, they realized my dad posed no threat, but they called 911 due to the intrusion. No charges were filed, and the police recognized what our family had feared for some time: dementia. The local ER staff evaluated him for acute medical issues, and after finding nothing urgent, they sent him home.</p>
<p>I must first publicly express my gratitude to the couple who found my dad. I can only imagine how distressing it must have been to find a stranger in their home. I sent them a letter thanking them for their kindness and understanding.</p>
<p>Let me explain a little bit about my father’s situation. My mother passed away in 2018, and my father has lived alone since. He has a new girlfriend who lives 30 minutes away. My brother lives two hours away, and I live three time zones away. Up until that point, we knew he had some memory difficulties, and a local neurologist had diagnosed him with mild cognitive impairment.</p>
<p>But we didn’t think it was that severe.</p>
<p>There had been instances where my dad chose mismatched or inappropriate clothing, burned his toast, or replaced the telephone in the refrigerator instead of on the phone charger. However, after the January 2024 incident, we went back to his neurologist, who sadly confirmed that with my dad’s combination of cognitive and functional impairments—most notably his lack of direction, wandering, and getting lost—meant that he had progressed from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. It became clear that my dad was likely no longer safe to be by himself at home.</p>
<p>While my dad was the breadwinner during his working years, my mother managed the household finances. She and my father had bought <a href="https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/long-term-care-insurance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long-term care (LTC) insurance</a> policies for the possibility of prolonged illness later in life. As best as I can tell from the paperwork, my parents bought these policies in 2004, they each paid about $14,000 in annual premiums for 10 years, and the daily benefit started at $200 per day. I was unaware of these policies when my mother died (after a relatively short illness), but I became aware of them when an uncle called and mentioned, “Your father has a long-term care insurance policy. I helped him get it.”</p>
<p>Thus began the long process of filing and obtaining claims with the LTC insurance company. I’d like to share some lessons learned from this experience.</p>


<h2><strong>What to Do with Your Relative's Long-Term Care Insurance</strong></h2>


<h3><strong>#1 Call the Insurance Company to Obtain an Application to File a Claim</strong></h3>
<p>For a while, my brother and I tried to track down the actual policy. We sifted through stacks of paperwork at our dad’s house and became frustrated (fairly and unfairly) that he didn’t know where the papers were located. When we finally called the insurance company, it, of course, had his policy on file. The company sent us an application, and we began filling out the paperwork. The application included several parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Authorization to obtain and disclose information</li>
<li>Claimant’s statement</li>
<li>Attending physician’s statement</li>
<li>Benefit direct deposit form</li>
<li>Fraud notice</li>
</ul>
<p>Try to get a point of contact in the company's call center if possible. We found calling more fruitful than emailing. Many of our emails went completely unanswered, which was a source of frustration and delayed the process.</p>

<h3><strong>#2 Insurance Companies Do Their Own Evaluations</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/net/l/insurance" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img decoding="async" width="250" height="250" src="https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Recommended-Insurance-Page_Ad_250x250_02.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Recommended-Insurance-Page_Ad_250x250_02.jpg 250w, https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Recommended-Insurance-Page_Ad_250x250_02-238x238.jpg 238w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"></a></p>
<p>Most LTC insurance policies require one of two conditions to be satisfied to qualify for a claim: the claimant must be unable to perform at least two activities of daily living (ADLs)—which include bathing, continence, dressing, eating, toileting, and transferring—or the claimant must have severe cognitive impairment. My father was already established with a neurologist, who certified that his dementia was severe enough to require supervision. Despite the neurologist’s (and my dad’s primary doctor’s) signature on the “Attending Physician’s Statement,” the LTC insurance company sent a contracted nurse to conduct an in-home evaluation. This further delayed the process of receiving the claims.</p>



<h3><strong>#3 Use Professional Help During the 90-Day Elimination Period and Beyond</strong></h3>
<p>When the family learned of my dad’s situation, aunts, uncles, and cousins offered to help care for him. His girlfriend also spent a lot of time with him. But when everyone was busy, we contracted with two companies for in-home health services. This mostly consisted of someone essentially adult-sitting him to ensure he didn’t do anything dangerous—like leaving the stove on or wandering outside at night—and occasionally reminding him to eat lunch or take a shower. After 90 calendar days, I called the LTC insurance company to ask for payments to begin. I should note that while waiting for LTC insurance payments to kick in, we were paying for these services with my father’s income from his retirement portfolio.</p>
<p>However, unlike a <a href="https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/what-you-need-to-know-about-disability-insurance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disability insurance</a> policy that starts paying out after 90 calendar days, LTC insurance policies don’t begin payments until 90 service days have passed. A service day is any calendar day during which professional health services are rendered and paid for, even if limited to only a few hours. Twenty-four hours of care was not necessary to have a “day” counted with our policy, but I would recommend that others going through this process check their own policy for what satisfies a “service day.” All the days our wonderful aunts, uncles, and cousins had stayed with him did not count toward his 90 service-day elimination period. I readjusted my tally and started counting the days on which hired help provided professional services.</p>


<h3><strong>#4 Indemnity Rider</strong></h3>
<p>Some LTC insurance policies include an indemnity rider that you can purchase in addition to the base policy. If you opt for this rider, the policy pays out a predetermined benefit, regardless of the expenses you incur. For my dad’s policy, he receives a daily benefit regardless of the number of hours of care provided. For example, there are days that he only receives seven hours of care (midnight to 7am when his girlfriend arrives to spend the rest of the day together), while other days he receives 24 hours of care. At $32-$34 an hour, seven hours of care costs $224-$238. My dad’s daily benefit is greater than this amount, so on some days we receive a surplus. However, these days are usually matched by the days he receives 24 hours of care, which can approach $800. For now, the LTC insurance payments are essentially covering the cost of his in-home care. I anticipate that as his dementia progresses and he has more days requiring 24-hour care, we will be paying for his care with both LTC payments and his retirement savings.</p>
<p>When we first signed up with a care provider company, it offered to bill the LTC insurance company directly. Since there were days where the LTC insurance benefit exceeded the cost of care, we wanted to pocket that difference rather than the care provider company keep it. We decided to have the LTC insurance payments directly deposited into my dad’s checking account, from which we then pay the care provider.</p>

<h3><strong>#5 Keep Your Own Tally and Double-Check the Dates of Service</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/misc/l/sermo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="250" height="250" src="https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Sermo.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Sermo.jpeg 250w, https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Sermo-238x238.jpeg 238w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"></a></p>
<p>The LTC insurance company collects invoices with the dates and hours for in-home care services listed, but it never accepted the invoices directly from me. It required the care provider companies to send them in. Fortunately, the care provider companies were kind enough to CC my brother and me on their emails. I kept a tally of the dates of service, and I was excited when we crossed the 90-day mark. However, when I contacted the LTC insurance company, it said my dad had only received 60 days of service. I double-checked my math and knew I was right. I asked the LTC insurance for its tally so I could compare. The discrepancy turned out to be the company's failure to account for overnight care, which spanned two different dates. After I informed it of its mistake and sent highlighted invoices proving the error, the company updated its records to reflect more than 90 days of service.</p>


<h3><strong>#6 Care Notes</strong></h3>
<p>My excitement over finally reaching the 90-day elimination period was short-lived because the next hurdle was “care notes.” The LTC insurance adjuster informed me that invoices alone were not enough; they also needed documentation that the adult-sitters were providing care for my dad. We had contracted with two different care provider companies—one for daytime care and one for overnight care. When the companies sent invoices to the LTC insurance company, one included care notes, but the other didn’t.</p>
<p>While I could see that care was provided (e.g., cooking lunch, cueing my dad to eat, reminding him to use the bathroom, helping him get dressed), the LTC insurance company threatened to discount the days provided by the company without care notes. After contacting the company, we learned that it had care notes but had only sent invoices. The care provider hadn’t realized the care notes were necessary. Fortunately, this was easily rectified, and both companies sent the required care notes.</p>


<h3><strong>#7 Check the Math</strong></h3>
<p>After all the delays, payments finally started coming in, and I was pleased to find that the company had backdated payments to begin on service day #91. Either my brother or I now check every month to ensure the LTC insurance company is paying for all the dates of service; we estimate we spend 1-2 hours per month checking the invoices and payments. Our dad’s LTC insurance company has a portal where we can log in to view received invoices, care notes, and subsequent payments. But the care provider companies must email or fax the invoices and care notes, and then a human at the company files them and adds them to the ongoing claim. The typical payment turnaround time is 1-2 weeks after the care notes and invoices are received.</p>


<h3><strong>#8 Ensure That Ongoing Invoices and Care Notes Are Still Being Sent In</strong></h3>
<p>Our latest issue is that the LTC insurance company is accidentally combining or mislabeling invoices. We use care providers with similar company names, and they share the words “senior” and “help” in their titles. The LTC insurance company has been misreading the invoices and combining them rather than separating them. We’re still working to get this corrected.</p>

<h3><strong>#9 Use Your Insurance Agent</strong></h3>
<p>My last piece of advice is to use your insurance agent if they’re willing to help. As mentioned earlier, the agent who helped my parents purchase these policies is a family member. I am incredibly grateful that we could reach out to him when we had questions. He also called the LTC insurance company on our behalf when our calls and messages went unanswered. We were close to involving a lawyer due to all the delays, but thanks to our uncle’s help, we avoided that additional expense.</p>

<p>As a guest writer recently pointed out, <a href="https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/long-distance-eldercare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long-distance eldercare</a> is difficult. My brother and I hope that, with the financial assistance from our dad’s LTC insurance policy, we can safely help him age in place in the home where he’s comfortable. We know there will be life disruptions, but with the help of LTC insurance, we worry less about financial disruptions.</p>
<p><strong>Have you had an experience with caring for an aging parent? Did they have LTC? Was it convenient, or was there more red tape than you would have imagined?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>
  All discussion is via a Google Group. You probably need a Google
  account. Your email will be public if you post but otherwise it will
  not be visible to anyone.
</p>

<p>
  There will be no Zoom or Google Hangout, it will purely be over text
  email.
</p>

<p>
  You should read the chapter before the date it
  is listed.
</p>

<h3>Discussion starter</h3>

<p>
  Each weekend, one person will send out an email to start
  discussion. It can be as short as a paragraph or two just to get
  discussion going. Anyone else can chime in afterward.
</p>

<p>
  It's most fun if this discussion starter doesn't summarize the
  chapter but tells a bit about themselves, their background, and what
  resonated or was confusing in the chapter, or how it tied back to
  something they experienced in the real-world.

<p><span>Interview</span> Launched in 1992, the boxy black ThinkPad with its little red nub remains the quintessential business productivity notebook. Unlike commercial offerings from competitors such as Dell and HP, Lenovo's laptop has a following of people who collect old models and celebrate each new innovation.</p>
<p>If you bought a ThinkPad between 1995 and 2017, it was probably designed under the oversight of David W. Hill, who served as lead designer under both IBM and Lenovo for those 22 years. We caught up with Hill, who today runs his own firm, ThinkNext Design, to talk about the history of ThinkPad, what drove him to make key design decisions, and the products he wanted to come out with but just couldn't.</p>
<div><p><a href="https://regmedia.co.uk/2025/07/30/davidhill.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://regmedia.co.uk/2025/07/30/davidhill.jpg?x=648&amp;y=430&amp;infer_y=1" alt="David Hill with a ThinkPad 700C" title="David Hill with a ThinkPad 700C" height="430" width="648"></a></p><p>David Hill with a ThinkPad 700C</p>
</div>
<p>In a wide-ranging conversation, Hill revealed that he tried several times to introduce additional laptops that had the famous "butterfly keyboard" found on the ThinkPad 701C. He spoke about wanting to create a portable all-in-one desktop that would fold up like a laptop. And he explained the evolution of the TrackPoint nub and the ThinkLight overhead light.</p>
<h3>Hill's career before ThinkPad</h3>
<p>Hill started at IBM in 1985 and spent ten years working as an industrial designer on non-ThinkPad projects, including the company's AS/400, a mid-range computer (between a mainframe and a PC) that came out in 1988. At the time, most PCs were gray or beige.</p>
<p>"I led the design, most notably of IBM's AS/400 Advanced series. Which was all black, which was unbelievable in the world of servers at the time," he said. "It was all black and kind of menacing looking as some people said. But now you can hardly buy a server that's not black."</p>
<h3>ThinkPad launches in 1992</h3>
<p>The original ThinkPads, the 300, 700, and 700C, came out in October 1992, and were designed by IBM stalwart Richard Sapper, with the idea that they would look like bento boxes. These were also the first laptops to use a pointing stick, the vaunted TrackPoint, which still appears on Lenovo's commercial laptops today. At this time, Hill was not yet on the team.</p>
<div><p><a href="https://regmedia.co.uk/2025/07/30/hill2.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://regmedia.co.uk/2025/07/30/hill2.jpg" alt="ThinkPad 700C, the first ThinkPad" title="ThinkPad 700C, the first ThinkPad" height="619" width="640"></a></p><p>ThinkPad 700C, the first ThinkPad</p>
</div>
<p>"I thought it was brilliant, and I still think it is," Hill said of the nub. "You know, there's some people that don't like a TrackPoint, but I think a lot of those people probably never tried one."</p>
<h3>The butterfly keyboard</h3>
<p>Hill took over the design reins of ThinkPad in 1995, just as the company was launching the ThinkPad 701C and its unique keyboard mechanism. The design work on this was done before he started, but he got to work with its creators John Karidis and Sapper and learn this iconic laptop's inside story. Unlike every other laptop, which has a keyboard that's the width of or shorter than the lid above it, the 701C used a butterfly-style keyboard that folded open to become larger when the laptop was in use.</p>
<div><p><a href="https://regmedia.co.uk/2025/07/30/hill3.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://regmedia.co.uk/2025/07/30/hill3.jpg?x=648&amp;y=486&amp;infer_y=1" alt="IBM ThinkPad 701C butterfly keyboard.

</div>
<p>"There was always a mismatch between screen size and full-size keyboard. Because when the 701C came out, that was about the biggest screen you could make," he said of the laptop with its 10-inch display. "People forget about this, but it was very difficult to make a full-color screen that was really big. You wanted to have a full-size keyboard; you ended up with a huge border around the screen."</p>
<p>It was Karidis who came up with the game-changing butterfly concept.</p>
<p>"John Karidis had this brilliant idea that the way to solve this was inspired by wooden blocks. He had a daughter and they were playing with these wooden blocks and there's two blocks that are rectangles," Hill said. "So he went to work the next day with this 'aha' moment, and he put a keyboard from a ThinkPad on a copy machine and then cut it at a diagonal with a pair of scissors and put it back together in two different directions... And then he invented this mechanism to make it actually move when you've opened the display."</p>

</div>
<p>Hill told <em>The Register</em> that he had wanted to make more ThinkPads with butterfly keyboards and had tried at least three times to make it happen – in one case there was a prototype where only half of the keyboard moved – but was never able to get there. Eventually, screens became big enough that there was no need to have a keyboard that expanded. However, Hill said, he thought about putting a butterfly keyboard on a netbook when they were a viable product category in the late aughts.</p>
<h3>Changes to everyone's favorite nub</h3>
<p>In addition to this work on ThinkPad keyboards, Hill also had influence over the design of the TrackPoint. The key improvements he oversaw were changes to the TrackPoint's red cap and its height.</p>
<p>"When I first started working on ThinkPad, [the TrackPoint] was rough, like it was called the 'cat tongue.' It was basically like sandpaper. And it gave you great traction, but I thought it didn't feel so great," he said. "I launched an initiative to create a new TrackPoint cap and we ended up actually developing one a lot of people called 'the Golf Tee' and then one called 'the Soft Dome.'"</p>
<div><p><a href="https://regmedia.co.uk/2025/07/30/hill5.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://regmedia.co.uk/2025/07/30/hill5.jpg?x=648&amp;y=486&amp;infer_y=1" alt="Four variations on the ThinkPad cap – Soft Dome, Golf Tee, Classic Dome, and Eraser Head.

Image by Raymangold22, Creative Commons 1.0</p>
</div>
<p>For several years, ThinkPad owners got three types of TrackPoint cap – Soft Dome, Golf Tee, and Original Dome – and could choose among them. However, at this point, the Soft Dome design has won out with a rather large, flat top that's filled with dots for texture and an easy grip. Hill said that he also changed the height of the TrackPoint over the years, making it shorter as the laptops themselves got thinner.</p>
<div><p><a href="https://regmedia.co.uk/2025/07/30/hill6.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://regmedia.co.uk/2025/07/30/hill6.jpg?x=648&amp;y=486&amp;infer_y=1" alt="ThinkPad TrackPoint with soft dome top.

Image by Inklein, Creative Commons 3.0" height="486" width="648"></a></p><p>ThinkPad TrackPoint with Soft Dome top. Image by Inklein, Creative Commons 3.0</p>
</div>
<p>During TrackPoint's heyday, Lenovo also licensed the technology to other companies while some competitors tried to make their own versions. Dell, Acer, HP, and Toshiba all had pointing sticks on their business laptops. However, none of these competitors were allowed to use a red cap and the feel just wasn't the same.</p>
<p>Another feature that Hill implemented was a scroll button for the TrackPoint, which is still in use. Today, the button sits between the left and right click TrackPoint buttons and allows you to scroll horizontally or vertically if you hold it down while pushing on the nub. In the early years of ThinkPad, there was no scroll button at all and then, in models like the ThinkPad T20 (shown below), it was in its own row below the left and right click buttons.</p>
<div><p><a href="https://regmedia.co.uk/2025/07/30/hill7.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://regmedia.co.uk/2025/07/30/hill7.jpg" alt="ThinkPad T20 with its scroll button below the left/right click.

</div>
<p>At one point, after IBM added touchpads to its laptops, Hill was almost forced to remove the TrackPoint scroll button because it was getting in the way of the pad.</p>
<p>"There were a lot of people who said 'well, we'll just get rid of it,'" Hill recalls. "And I said, 'whoa, wait, wait a minute. This scrolling thing with a TrackPoint is a huge advantage because I can just hold down one button and I can scroll omnidirectionally. I'm not just talking up and down. I'm all over the whole screen.'"</p>

    

<p>He eventually created a compromise where the scroll button moved in between the left and right buttons. Although touchpads have gotten a lot better over the years and every manufacturer but Lenovo has ditched its pointing sticks, Hill still believes that the TrackPoint is the best way to navigate on a laptop.</p>
<div><p><a href="https://regmedia.co.uk/2025/07/30/hill8.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://regmedia.co.uk/2025/07/30/hill8.jpg?x=648&amp;y=486&amp;infer_y=1" alt="ThinkPad with both middle and side TrackPoint buttons.

</div>
<p>"It's very efficient because you don't have to take your hands off the home row [to use a TrackPoint]. And you're not wildly moving your hands around like when you're rubbing a pad or or rolling a ball with your thumb," he said.</p>

</div>
<p>Hill said that, while he still gets new ThinkPads and uses them, he would not be interested in owning the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/c/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpadx9/" rel="nofollow">ThinkPad X9</a>, which is a new model that lacks a TrackPoint in an attempt to appeal to a different demographic of users than other SKUs.</p>
<h3>ThinkLight, a better way to illuminate the keyboard</h3>
<p>One of the features Hill is most proud of developing is the ThinkLight, an overhead light located above the screen that lit up the entire keyboard and deck. Though the advent of keyboard backlights has made the ThinkLight redundant – Lenovo discontinued it in 2013 – it offers capabilities that backlights do not. If you want to place a paper on top of your keyboard, the LED will light it up, allowing you to see more than just your key legends.</p>
<div><p><a href="https://regmedia.co.uk/2025/07/30/hill10.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://regmedia.co.uk/2025/07/30/hill10.jpg?x=648&amp;y=648&amp;infer_y=1" alt="ThinkLight on and off on a keyboard.

Image by Ashley Pomeroy, Creative Commons 4.0" height="648" width="648"></a></p><p>ThinkLight on and off on a keyboard. Image by Ashley Pomeroy, Creative Commons 4.0</p>
</div>
<p>The idea for the ThinkLight came to Hill when he was on a flight from Japan, where IBM's Yamato Lab was located. He wanted to do some work on his laptop, but he didn't want to turn on his seat's overhead light because he felt guilty about waking up the other passengers. Then he noticed a woman on the plane with a tiny booklight attached to her book and inspiration struck.</p>
<p>When Hill got back to Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina, where he was based, he told his colleagues that he wanted to put an LED on the top edge of a ThinkPad and provide a switch to turn it on. His colleagues then made a prototype laptop with the ThinkLight and sent it to him. He immediately went to show it to the boss.</p>

        


        

<p>"So I called the general manager of ThinkPad at the time, Adalio Sanchez, and I said 'Adalio, I've got something you've got to see,'" Hill said. "So he comes down, and I took him in this little closet, and I had the model sitting there, and I said 'OK, I'm going to turn off the lights and I'm going to turn this thing on.' And so I turn off the lights. You couldn't see anything, right? I mean, you can see the display was illuminated. That's it. I pushed the little switch, and he looked at it. He said, 'We've got to make this.'"</p>
<div><p><a href="https://regmedia.co.uk/2025/07/30/hill11.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://regmedia.co.uk/2025/07/30/hill11.jpg?x=648&amp;y=486&amp;infer_y=1" alt="ThinkLight.

</div>
<p>Hill said he still misses the ThinkLight and notes that it was, at the time of the transition, much more cost-effective than a backlight. The former would cost 40 cents per unit while the latter added a full $12 to the bill of materials.</p>
<p>When designing the 25th anniversary ThinkPad, which came out in 2017, Hill brought back the ThinkLight, but he actually wanted to have – for the first time – two LEDs instead of one. The dual lights would have eliminated shadows and provided even better illumination, but unfortunately, this effort proved too costly to make it into the final product.</p>

<h3>The ThinkPad X300, proving that Lenovo could outdo IBM</h3>
<p>In 2005, Chinese PC vendor Lenovo bought ThinkPad and the rest of IBM's PC division. According to Hill, IBM had been winding down its PC business for years, looking to get out of the market.</p>
<p>"IBM at the time was, I like to describe it as they were slowly turning off hot water in the shower," he said. "If you wouldn't notice, the budgets get a little bit smaller. The portfolio gets a little smaller. They were less interested in developing new concepts. What they're really trying to do is get the books in order and sell a business."</p>
<p>After the sale, Hill got to work on building the ultimate ThinkPad, the X300. When it launched in early 2008, the X300 was one of the thinnest and lightest laptops made, tipping the scales at just 2.9 pounds with a slim profile of just 0.7 to 0.9 inches thick. And it did all that with a built-in DVD burner. It was also the first ThinkPad to ship without an IBM logo on it.</p>
<div><p><a href="https://regmedia.co.uk/2025/07/30/hill12.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://regmedia.co.uk/2025/07/30/hill12.jpg?x=648&amp;y=765&amp;infer_y=1" alt="ThinkPad X300.

Image by Sean Neakums, Creative Commons 2.0</p>
</div>
<p>Hill said that the X300 is the favorite ThinkPad he worked on, not only because of its thinness, but also because it proved that, under Lenovo, he could build an even better product than he had for IBM.</p>
<p>"There was a giant scare that this Chinese company was going to destroy ThinkPad, and it was going to become cheerful and ruin it and all this kind of stuff," he said. "And so we had this concept to build the best ThinkPad ever made that was so advanced and so well thought through that it would leapfrog anything that IBM had ever done."</p>

        

<p>The X300 was an astounding critical success. It made the cover of Business Week magazine in February 2008 and became the subject of a book by Steve Hamm called <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/Race-Perfect-Ultimate-Portable-Computer/dp/B006OI3IH4">The Race for Perfect</a>. At $2,700 to $3,000, it was very expensive for the time, but it showed that Lenovo could compete with Apple's MacBook Air, and that ThinkPad was here to stay.</p>
<h3>Keyboard development: From seven rows to six</h3>
<p>With their deep travel, snappy feedback, and ergonomically sculpted keys, ThinkPad keyboards have a well-deserved reputation as the best in the business. However, in 2011, there was quite a controversy as the laptops slowly moved from having seven rows of keys to six. Many ThinkPad fans did not like the change.</p>
<div><p><a href="https://regmedia.co.uk/2025/07/30/hill13.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://regmedia.co.uk/2025/07/30/hill13.jpg?x=648&amp;y=486&amp;infer_y=1" alt="ThinkPad X200 with seven-row keyboard.

</div>
<p>The seventh row sat above the function keys and provided extra room for keys such as Scroll Lock, Pause, and, on some models, tall, double-row Esc and Delete keys. It also had more traditional, square shaped keys that were packed closer together. The six-row keyboard got rid of some of the legacy keys, had no row above function, and used an island-style layout with the appearance of more empty space between the key caps.</p>
<p>Hill was involved in the decision to redesign the keyboard, which he says was largely based on the changing screen aspect ratios of the time. As laptops moved to wider 16:9 displays from the earlier 16:10 and 4:3, there was less vertical real estate on the deck to play with.</p>
<div><p><a href="https://regmedia.co.uk/2025/07/30/hill14.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://regmedia.co.uk/2025/07/30/hill14.jpg?x=648&amp;y=431&amp;infer_y=1" alt="A ThinkPad X1 with a six-row keyboard.

</div>
<p>"It's very difficult to make a seven-row keyboard anymore because of the aspect ratio of the display and the whole arrangement of the pieces on the inside," he said. "It's a decision that was not made lightly, however. I still like the seven-row keyboard and, as aspect ratios change, and they continue to change, I don't know. Maybe someday somebody will be interested in it again."</p>
<p>Years later, there was still a lot of nostalgia for the seven-row keyboard. In 2015, Hill was working on a retro ThinkPad that would become the ThinkPad 25th Anniversary edition (released in 2017). He <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151112171550/http://blog.lenovo.com/en/blog/retro-thinkpad-survey-2-displays-keyboard&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1753911353401570&amp;usg=AOvVaw18zNKxwmZAtXW4us6lkMbH" rel="nofollow">surveyed users</a>&nbsp;about what they'd want in the retro laptop and found that 80.3 percent wanted the seven-row over the six-row.</p>
<h3>The ThinkPad mobile desktops we never got</h3>
<p>When I asked Hill about products he wanted to come out with but never got to, he talked about an idea for portable workstations that would fold up like a laptop but have a separate keyboard and screen like a desktop when you put them on your desk. He collaborated with butterfly keyboard creator John Karidis on this concept, but couldn't make it ready for market.</p>

</ul>
<p>"We did a lot of experimentation with laptops that sort of unfolded to be more like a desktop: things where the display elevated or the keyboard would remove so you could use them like a workstation, rather than just being a clamshell with a hinge, you open and close," Hill recalled. "We did a lot of experimentation with that and got close a few times, but never could completely sell it. I always thought it was an opportunity to create a new category."</p>
<h3>Maintaining ThinkPad traditions</h3>
<p>Even after 32 years on the market, the iconic design language of the ThinkPad remains largely unchanged. The laptops have gotten thinner, lighter, and less boxy, but most of them are still raven-black rectangles with a familiar accent of red from the TrackPoint nub.</p>
<p>Hill was not opposed to offering other colors as long as black was the default. In some ThinkPad lines today, you can get a silver colorway and, on occasion, there have been other colors such as the fire engine red cover on the ThinkPad Edge in 2010.</p>
<div><p><a href="https://regmedia.co.uk/2025/07/30/hill15.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://regmedia.co.uk/2025/07/30/hill15.jpg?x=648&amp;y=430&amp;infer_y=1" alt="ThinkPad Edge in red.

</div>
<p>"Black is a color that's highly associated with ThinkPad. It's like, Owens Corning fiberglass is pink and John Deere tractors are green and ThinkPads are black," he opined. "But it doesn't necessarily mean that you can't offer a ThinkPad in a different color. I never really had a problem with that, as long as you can still get a black one."</p>
<p>Hill said that his approach to ThinkPad design was to give it what he called a "purposeful evolution" where it changed to accommodate new features and developments, but the design language was always recognizable.</p>
<p>"I was very instrumental in creating this purposeful evolution model for ThinkPad. I didn't think that it needed to be reinvented every year. I thought it needed to be improved," Hill said. "It's the same way Porsche treats the 911 or Jeep with the Wrangler. They don't start over every year. They build on a heritage."</p>
<p>One thing he changed over the years was the latch system. Originally, you had to pull two latches to open the lid and Hill wanted to cut that to one latch. So he made a design where one knob moved two latches at once. Eventually, the weight distribution in laptops changed so that latches weren't necessary at all, because the systems were lighter and the lids did not fly open without them.</p>

        

<p>"You have to remember at the time [we had latches], these laptops were very thick and heavy: much, much heavier than they are today, and much more fragile. So having these latches was very important," he said. "When you close it, when it pinged, it was almost like closing the door on a Porsche 911. It has this sound of authority."</p>
<p>Hill also had some advice on navigating corporate politics, telling the story of a general manager of ThinkPad (whom he didn't want to name) who tried to get him to remake the designs.</p>
<p>"They brought him into the design studio to show him the design models for the next generation, and he looked at me kind of funny. And he said, 'These look like last year's ThinkPads.

<p>The manager was undeterred and ordered Hill to come back to him in 90 days with an action plan for redesigning ThinkPads. Hill took the issue to his manager, the VP of marketing for IBM's PC business.</p>

  <p>It is wild to think that it has been only a handful of weeks.</p>
<p>Claude Code has considerably changed my relationship to writing and maintaining code at scale. I still write code at the same level of quality, but I feel like I have a new freedom of expression which is hard to fully articulate.</p>
<p>Claude Code has decoupled myself from writing every line of code, I still consider myself fully responsible for everything I ship to Puzzmo, but the ability to instantly create a whole scene instead of going line by line, word by word is incredibly powerful.</p>
<p>I believe with Claude Code, we are at the <em>“introduction of photography”</em> period of programming. Painting by hand just doesn’t have the same appeal anymore when a single concept can just appear and you shape it into the thing you want with your code review and editing skills.</p>
<p>If this feels like an intimidating line-of-thought then welcome to the mid-2020s, nothing is stable anymore and change is the only constant. Sorry. I didn’t make it so nearly all of culture’s changes are <em>bad</em>, and I think that LLMs are already doing social damage and will do much worse in the future - but this genie is fully out of the bottle and it is substantially going to change what we think of as programming.</p>
<h2 id="a-retrospective-on-the-last-6-weeks">A Retrospective on the last 6 Weeks<a href="#a-retrospective-on-the-last-6-weeks" arialabel="Heading anchor">#</a></h2>
<p>This article builds on <a href="https://blog.puzzmo.com/posts/2025/06/07/orta-on-claude/">“On Coding with Claude”</a> which I wrote after using Claude for a week. If you think that I am AI-pilled, you can get my nuanced take on LLMs at <a href="https://blog.puzzmo.com/posts/2025/06/07/orta-on-claude/#before-we-start">the start</a> of that post.</p>
<p>That said, this is transformative and I want to try give you some perspective from the last 6 weeks of activity in the Puzzmo engineering space to try and show you what I’ve been seeing.</p>
<h3 id="maintenance-is-significantly-cheaper">Maintenance is Significantly Cheaper<a href="#maintenance-is-significantly-cheaper" arialabel="Heading anchor">#</a></h3>
<p>I have been on many projects with people which have taken weeks full-time to perform some sort of mundane task: “converting this JS codebase to TypeScript”, “Update to Swift X”, “Switch to a monorepo” they’re the kind of things which are delicate migrations which require a gazillion rebases.</p>
<p>Here is a list of things which I have completed, <strong>solo</strong>, since getting access to Claude Code:</p>
<ul>
<li>Converting hundreds of React Native components to just React</li>
<li>Replaced 3 non-trivial RedwoodJS systems with home-grown or mature, supported replacements</li>
<li>Built complex REPLs for multiple internal and external projects</li>
<li>Switched almost every db model to have a consistent ‘flags’ system for booleans</li>
<li>Converted from Jest to Vitest</li>
<li>Created our front-end testing strategies for React</li>
<li>Moved many things defined in code to run via the CMS</li>
<li>Made significant headway on server-side rendering</li>
<li>Re-wrote the iOS app’s launch system due to deprecations</li>
<li>Built a suite of LLM created (and framed as such, hen hand annotated) documentation for systems like leaderboards, dailies etc</li>
<li>Converted a significant amount of our design system primitives to use base-ui</li>
<li>Migrated significant code from inline styles to stylex</li>
<li>Converted all animations in puzzmo.com to use the same techniques as games</li>
<li>Fixed multiple bugs which have been around since the start of Puzzmo</li>
<li>Updated all Vite integrations</li>
<li>Migrate all Puzzmo production projects to node 22</li>
<li>Convert the games repo to a real monorepo</li>
<li>Built iPad support for the Puzzmo app</li>
</ul>
<p>None of these projects are the “actual work” which I need to do on a day to day basis as the ‘bizdev’ guy on Puzzmo for this year. These are <em>literally side-projects</em> which I did <em>on my own</em> while working on something else.</p>
<p>For clarity in the back because this is shocking to me, while I was still working on the existing roadmap I had prior to Claude Code over the last 6 weeks, I accomplished all of these things on my own. Mostly in the background (and then with a polish pass day for some of the larger ones). I didn’t go from working ~10 hour days to working ~16 hours or anything like that either.</p>
<p>This was years of <em>“tech debt” / “tech innovation”</em> backlog for me! Done in just over a month and a half.</p>
<p>If you understand what you are doing, the capacity for building and handling the breadth of tasks which typically live within the remit of “technical debt” <em>do not need to be treated as debt</em> and you can just do it as you are working on other things.</p>
<p><em>‘carving out some time on the schedule’</em> is now so incredibly cheap that getting started and making a serious dint is <em>something you can prime before going into a meeting</em>, then deciding if you thought it was the right thing after. Mind-blowing.</p>
<h3 id="write-first-decide-later">Write First, Decide Later<a href="#write-first-decide-later" arialabel="Heading anchor">#</a></h3>
<p>A habit I have been trying to form is to give an idea a shot before I fully shoot it down. For example, since day 1 on Puzzmo I had been waiting on figuring out a testing strategy for the front-end because I wanted to be able to hire someone to fully own “puzzmo.com” and a part of that is figuring out how to not do as many regressions as we get.</p>
<p>Figuring out a testing strategy for the front-end isn’t pretty, and I have seen a lot of really bad test suites which over-test and become brittle things that engineers don’t like to work with. The mix of networking, react, the scope of contexts, the dom, flakiness in tooling just leads to answers where you are looking for the least bad solution which you’ve used yourself and feel comfortable maintaining.</p>
<p>I wondered if I needed to wait for someone else, so instead of just “adding a test suite” - I opted to have Claude Code write tests for every pull request I made to the front end over the course of two weeks.</p>
<p>Then, after seeing the tests, I deleted them. It added an extra 5m to my process, but gave me an insight each time into different ways in which other projects deal with the problem. After weeks of this, I was ready to start looking at that problem systemically.</p>
<p>The idea of writing tests for every pull request and then deleting it would just be so much time, there would be no way I’d be OK with doing.</p>
<p>Or a recent example from slack where I just vibed for half a day in the background on trying to make an abstraction for CRUD resources in our CMS tools:</p>

<section>
<p>This means you can work in each independently and still visually recognize the differences in you workspaces by having a different theme:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.puzzmo.com/posts/2025/07/30/six-weeks-of-claude-code/clone-2-settings.png" alt="alt text"></p>
<p>My best argument is simply that each clone represents a single pull request that you can work on at a time. If you are writing pull requests and collaborating with others then that is still pretty important. I made it so that our dev servers close any processes using the ports you want and its trivial to jump between the two clones as Claude Code is working stuff out before you are looking build.</p>
<h3 id="game-design-collaboration">Game design collaboration<a href="#game-design-collaboration" arialabel="Heading anchor">#</a></h3>
<p>Since Puzzmo was created this was the process of creating a game:</p>
<ul>
<li>We create some prototypes using all sorts of technologies</li>
<li>Collectively we work through the prototypes with feedback</li>
<li>We decide if this game is worth shipping</li>
<li>The game team re-write the from scratch in our tech stack, and with puzzmo’s system integrations</li>
</ul>
<p>The process of this is weeks before any production code is written, if at all. At our current throughput, we roughly release a game a quarter at the level of polish we want to achieve.</p>
<p>In a post-Claude Code world, this model can be simplified greatly and it is a space we are exploring. I created a new Puzzmo monorepo (that’s three now, “app”, “games” and this new one “prototypes”) which emulates the infrastructure of the games repo but has significantly different expectations on the type of code being shipped. With this repo, a game designer can go from an idea to something running on puzzmo.com for admins in a couple of hours, you write the code, then go into our admin CMS and click a few buttons and it’s done.</p>
<p>To go from “this is good for the team” to “we should make this public” takes a bit of hands-on work from me and Saman, but it’s a different ball park of effort compared to our current production pipeline.</p>
<p>We released <a href="https://blog.puzzmo.com/posts/2025/07/04/missing-link/">Missing Link</a> using this technique, which seems to be a hit. This… actually is a bit of a problem for us. I am happy for us to have a game designer’s code running on Puzzmo for a time-gated experiment, but I am not OK with this turning into Puzzmo canon with the rest of the games.</p>
<p>The flexibility which allows a game designer to make a prototype is the part that makes it un-suitable for writing long-term production code. This leaves us with a few options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finish the experiment and stop having the game on the site</li>
<li>Re-write the game as production code</li>
<li>Declare some games as not quite having every Puzzmo integration feature</li>
<li>Explore making it more possible to write ‘production worthy’ code in prototypes</li>
<li>Extend the experiment to give ourselves time to figure another option</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these have trade-offs, and it isn’t obvious what the right idea is. The problem is novel because prior to Claude Code it wasn’t worth the effort of integrating prototype code with Puzzmo’s systems — now it’s trivial and accomplishable by anyone on the team. We can really deliver on the idea of ’experimental’ games that we launched with, which means we have to be much more thoughtful about the risk of launching too many games that people want us to keep around.</p>
<h3 id="taking-a-shot-during-triage">Taking a Shot During Triage<a href="#taking-a-shot-during-triage" arialabel="Heading anchor">#</a></h3>
<p>One thing I have been experimenting with during our weekly triage of all raised GitHub issues is asking the Claude Code GitHub action to take a stab at a pull request while we are talking about what we think as a group of engineers:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.puzzmo.com/posts/2025/07/30/six-weeks-of-claude-code/claude-code-pr.png" alt="A screenshot of a GitHub issues"></p>
<p>Or one where I was the one providing enough context myself in the issue:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.puzzmo.com/posts/2025/07/30/six-weeks-of-claude-code/nuanced-issue.png" alt="Another screenshot of a github issue"></p>
<p>As I am the one responsible for getting that Pull Request into production, that’s the first few steps ready and for smaller things I’ve found it to be a solid one-shot now that the repo is very well set up.</p>
<h2 id="who-has-been-successful-using-it-internally">Who has been successful using it internally?<a href="#who-has-been-successful-using-it-internally" arialabel="Heading anchor">#</a></h2>
<p>I think it’s worth noting here that we offered Claude Code to everyone on the team from the moment it because obvious how powerful of a tool it was for me personally.</p>
<p>I would say from our team, the sort of people who have used and found value the most are people with both product, technical skills and agency to feel like they can try things.</p>
<p>One of them said that Claude Code freed them from the anxiety of the first step in programming constantly.</p>
<p>Justin Searls did an interesting write-up where he described an idea of <a href="https://justin.searls.co/posts/full-breadth-developers/">full-breadth developers</a> where-in he argues that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Up until a few months ago, the best developers played the violin. Today, they play the orchestra.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which I think is correct, within the Puzzmo team the people whose skill-sets are being self-driven, run their own verticals and feel like they have the freedom to explore and push those boundaries are doing really cool work. It bursts out of any explicit job role boundaries and it becomes a pleasure to collab at a larger/faster scale on ideas than before.</p>
<p>So I will double-down on saying that everything <a href="https://justin.searls.co/posts/full-breadth-developers/">in Justin’s post</a> echoes what is happening inside the Puzzmo engineering team and his post is really worth musing over.</p>
<h3 id="what-do-i-think-makes-it-successful-in-our-codebases">What Do I Think Makes It Successful in our Codebases<a href="#what-do-i-think-makes-it-successful-in-our-codebases" arialabel="Heading anchor">#</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We use monorepos. I was lucky to have spent the time <a href="https://.puzzmo.com/posts/2025/01/22/turborepo/">a year ago</a> to take every project and move it into a two main environments. This was originally done to reflect the working processes of the engineering teams. My goal was to make it possible to go from db schema change to front-end components in a single pull request.</p>
<p>A monorepo is perfect for working with an LLM, because it can read the file which represents our schema, it can read the sdl files defining the public GraphQL API, read the per-screen requests and figure out what you’re trying to do. Having a single place with so much context means that <em>I</em> as user of Claude Code do not need to tell it that sort of stuff and a vague message like <em>“Add a xyz field to the user model in the db and make it show in this screen”</em> is something that Claude Code can do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My tech choices were made a decade ago. This video of a conference talk I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Z3loALSVQM">gave from 2018</a> is still the way I introduce people to the Puzzmo codebase and the mentality behind these tech choices. React, Relay, GraphQL, TypeScript and (now StyleX) are boring and <em>very explicit</em> technologies. There are compilation steps in all of these systems which means everything has to be available locally and correct to run, this makes it a bit of a curve to learn but often when you have got it right - you know you have got it right. For our admin tools, its even more boring/mature, I’m still using <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>!</p>
<p>For an LLM, these technologies are very well baked into its training set and Claude Code knows to do things like “run the Relay compiler” (when I saw Claude Code first do that, I knew I was in for a wild ride) which gives it incremental ways to be validating the changes it has done are working.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This isn’t novel work. Most of the stuff we’re doing on a day to day basis is pretty normal down-to-earth CRUD style apps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These codebases aren’t that big, nor that old. Nothing is older than 2021 and while I keep things up-to-date, I try to have a long-tail of support / backwards compatibility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our business is literally the test suite / benchmark for these models. For example, on the 28th of June, two days before posting this <a href="https://z.ai/blog/glm-4.5">GLM-4.5</a> came out. Offering a way to run an ~80% as good as <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/29/space-invaders/">Claude Code on your computer</a> locally. How do they measure that 80%? Here is <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/zai-org/CC-Bench-trajectories#test-dataset">the table from</a> their benchmarks of what they use:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.puzzmo.com/posts/2025/07/30/six-weeks-of-claude-code/dataset-GLM-45.png" alt="alt text"></p>
<p>Puzzmo’s day-to-day work is represented in ~(39/52)% of their testing infrastructure!</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>I thought I would see a pretty drastic change in terms of Pull Requests, Commits and Line of Code merged in the last 6 weeks. I don’t think that holds water though:</p>

<section>
<p>This is a 3 month chart, with a month of post-Claude Code. I just asked it to make a script to generate a CSV from looking at repos on my harddrive.</p>
<p>That said, I think anyone internally would feel like the pace of change inside Puzzmo has most definitely increased (at least in the areas I contribute) but those numbers haven’t <em>really</em> changed in reality.</p>
<p>There was a <a href="https://metr.org/blog/2025-07-10-early-2025-ai-experienced-os-dev-study/">recent paper</a> (which is from the pre-Claude Code days) which says that developers with AI over-estimate its impact and maybe I am.</p>
<p>Doesn’t <em>feel</em> it though. Did you see that list at the top? I feel like I’m constantly trashing my usual estimation timings to the point where it’s hard for me to gauge how long a task will take.</p>
<h3 id="you-dont-have-to-obsess-over-llm-trends">You Don’t Have To Obsess Over LLM Trends<a href="#you-dont-have-to-obsess-over-llm-trends" arialabel="Heading anchor">#</a></h3>
<p>While intoxicating at first, settling in to Claude Code usage just becomes mundane normal tool use after a while. You do not need to spend your time worrying about Sonnet or Opus, or grabbing every Claude Code competitor like Gemini CLI, Qwen Code or some other model that is cool. I have not used anything but Claude Code with whatever it does on the $100 a month account and I am doing very fine. I’ve heard good things about asking Gemini when Claude Code is stuck, but I’ve found that if Claude Code is stuck, I have not been doing a good job framing our work and a re-examination is worth the time.</p>
<p>I’ve never set up an MCP server, I’ve found doing voice-chat super awkward and not used it and I don’t follow the “blue tick-y” people on Twitter who have some “*.ai” bio. Those folks can do their thing, but I’m very happy not engaging.</p>
<p>There will be a future when it makes sense to think about looking at other ecosystem tools, but for me the difference between pre-Claude Code and post-Claude Code is so substantial that any increments between it and others (which will be better in some ways, worse in others) is not worth the hassle for such a small incremental win.</p>
<p>Running something locally is tempting, but the networked versions like Claude Code are always gonna be a step ahead, and as long as I do not need to think about usage limits (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/17/anthropic-tightens-usage-limits-for-claude-code-without-telling-users/">yes, I know</a>) then we’re in a good spot.</p>
<h3 id="you-can-let-claude-rest">You Can Let Claude Rest<a href="#you-can-let-claude-rest" arialabel="Heading anchor">#</a></h3>
<p>Like with a mobile phone, you can become consumed by the notion that because Claude Code can run at all times, you should make it run at all times. Effectively doom-scrolling in your terminal (or phone?!) instead.</p>
<p>It’s worth remembering that any tool can be used at any time, but that you are the one driving it and your energy / capacity to make informed decisions is not infinite.</p>
<h3 id="i-run-via-claude-yolo">I run via <code>claude yolo</code><a href="#i-run-via-claude-yolo" arialabel="Heading anchor">#</a></h3>
<p>I have been trying to make a list of everything I’m OK with:</p>
<details>
    <summary>
        .claude/settings.json
    </summary>
    <div>
        
    <pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>{</span></span>

<span><span>  }</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>

    </div>
    
</details>

<p>But it’s still not enough to constantly feel like I’m being asked things that I don’t need to confirm. So I run <code>claude --dangerously-skip-permissions</code> aka <code>claude yolo</code>. The worst things that have happened to me have been having my dev db wiped during a bad Prisma migration, and that Claude Code decided it should make a commit, and then a Pull Request.</p>
<p>My theory for the latter two is that if a human is expected to read it, a human should have wrote it. I’m OK with something like:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>[Authored description, or one liner]</span></span>
<span><span></span></span>
<span><span>---</span></span>
<span><span></span></span>
<span><span>[Codegen'd PR template]</span></span>
<span><span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>But I’m not slopping about in production.</p>

<p>One thing I’ve talked with folks earlier in their careers who want to still be doing a lot of the grunt work themselves is to consider writing their work, then comparing their results to the same requested by Claude Code.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_construction">Parallel construction</a> is a way to have your cake and eat it. You’re still learning and growing, but your results can be honed by seeing how the aggregate of training data in Claude Code has also decided to do it. Claude Code likely has a deeper ecosystem understanding, and may read more source code in the current codebase as well as knowing abstractions you’ve still not learned.</p>
<p>IMO treating it as a competitor which you can learn from is a much healthier alternative to either giving up and just accepting you don’t need to know stuff anymore, or putting your head in the sand and assuming somehow this change won’t affect you.</p>
<h3 id="you-can-just-do-it-for-side-projects">“You can just do it” for Side Projects<a href="#you-can-just-do-it-for-side-projects" arialabel="Heading anchor">#</a></h3>
<p>Throughout my entire programming career, like all humans I have been largely constrained in my capacity for side-projects and one-offs by the fact I still want to have a life. I choose to devote myself to contributing to large-scale open source to make me feel good about the amount of time I commit to the craft.</p>
<p>In concrete terms, that means spending time on projects like CocoaPods, Danger, Jest, GraphQL were things I did instead of making fun projects to explore a technology, or to fix a smaller nit.</p>
<p>Now it’s different. I can just take a stab and decide if I like the result. In one hour of exploration with Claude Code, I feel like can do roughly a weekends worth of exploration.</p>
<h4 id="eg-inline-chats">E.g. Inline Chats<a href="#eg-inline-chats" arialabel="Heading anchor">#</a></h4>
<p>For example, this blog post. When I was musing about it, I thought, <em>‘it’d be nice to show the Claude Code conversations inline’</em> and then subsequently, <em>“wouldn’t it be fun to bring back Adium themes for it”</em>. So. I just got started.</p>

<div>
    
    <div>
        <p>So, I spec’d out a rough idea of what I was looking for. Described it pretty well up-front, took the dogs for an hour-long walk and came back to a reasonable approximation of the CLI which would have taken me a few hours to build by hand.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a lot of code, but it was a lot of research, how do I re-create the Adium theme HTML, how do you make sense of claude code’s message formatting, how do you handle keeping resources local for a preview.</p>

<p>With that working enough to be able to correctly mix the ideas, I gave it a polish pass.</p>

<div>
    
    <div>
        <p>I’ve polished and deployed enough npm modules (<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/~orta">174?!</a>), so again, totally within my skills to do this without thinking too hard. Instead I treated this project as a fun side gig while watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LRyOw1R_SE">Apex Legends</a>.</p>
<p>If you read the chat, you’ll see that I do spend some time figuring out how to filter some things, how to show messages in a particular way but this is systemic babysitting and code which I really don’t care about.</p>

<p>A feature like this is a <em>full weekend</em> project, easily about 10-12 hours to get right and feel shippable for me. Instead most of the work happened when I was away and then the polishing was sporadic. Maybe the whole thing took ~2 hours of my thinking time? <em>This is wild</em>.</p>
<p>If you want to see the rest of the conversations to get it to the point where I shipped this blog post, here they are:</p>

        <p>This is a chat where I have a general sense of what I want, but know that I don’t actually know the answer around postgres indexing and how it effects mass deletes.</p>
<p>So first I ask a general question where it is using my prisma definition file to determine what is currently set up in the db.</p>
<p>We iterate on a scripting improvement, and make it possible to test locally.</p>
<p>After trying locally, I give it a “kinda” and then ask for a more explicit technique.</p>
<p>With that set up I go through all the code, review it locally, fix up style make it work according to how I would write it.</p>

<p>You might note that it makes some guesses (“10-20%”" of our gameplays are anon users), then make bold promises from that guess:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>That’s an 80-85% reduction in index size!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which I doubt. However, the code was solid, it’s got significantly more logs than I would have written (useful for a daily task) and I feel like I understand what the index does. I went and added a bunch of glue comments <em>“this script works with the index in migration y, so any updates…”</em></p>

        <p>I knew this was going to be nightmare PR, which you can <a href="https://github.com/puzzmo-com/xd-crossword-tools/pull/42">see here</a>.</p>
<p>I started by adding fixtures into the repo, and providing context via <a href="https://github.com/puzzmo-com/xd-crossword-tools/issues/31">an issue</a> which I had left ideas in. To get started, I framed this task as ’this is the long term goal, to get started we will do Y.’. Y here being an ASCII snapshot of the bars.</p>
<p>We started by building out a way to visualize the work, and Claude Code got very close. In the end, I took it’s work and finished the integration myself.</p>
<p>Once I had a way to visualize the solution, we could start looking at the main chunk of the work</p>

<p>I used tests based on ASCII snapshot to hardcode test using the explicit version of the bars in the imported file format jpz, then created a test which relied on the algorithm we were going to create. This meant I, and Claude, had a very explicit way to judge how the algorithm was working.</p>
<p>The import algorithm which existed for a jpz was too naive, and imported clues were wrong which meant we spent a long time trying to get the two snapshots to match. Claude kept cheating and hardcoding the answers! It took till I re-evaluated all of the clues (by making a separate test on the import for these clues) for a fresh re-examination of the algorithm to start getting somewhere.</p>

        <p>I wanted to build a design for printable PDFs of Crosswords. I already had a working pipeline for generating them and needed to work on the layout specifically.</p>
<p>I would have considered this a relatively easy problem to work with, but it turned out that there just isn’t a set of CSS primitives that allows for columns <em>and</em> re-flows around an image.</p>
<p>Claude was good for trying the different css properties and systems I was working with, and I experimented with different ways to describe or show the problem but never managed to get it working.</p>

<p>I think I had the wrong core abstraction in mind in these conversations, either by being too specific in my recommendations or experimenting through half answers.</p>
<p>In the end, I will have to re-write it to use JavaScript to do the layouts I think.</p>

<p>Perhaps an interesting place to end it, is how do I think about this tool in terms of its capabilities. Claude Code knows a lot, and you can easily send it reference material in terms of links, screenshots and extra code for context. I’ve found it to sit somewhere at the stage of <a href="https://artsy.github.io/blog/2016/09/10/Help!-I'm-becoming-Post-Junior/">“Post-Junior”</a>, there’s a lot of experience there and a whole boat-load of energy but it doesn’t really do a good job remembering things you ask (even via <code>CLAUDE.md</code> and the scope of it’s ownership is obviously trivial).</p>
<p>At Artsy, early on we had <a href="https://artsy.github.io/blog/2015/04/03/artsy-engineering-compensation-framework/">a 5 step technical ladder</a> for engineers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Engineer 1 - Can ship a well defined product feature.</p>
<p>Engineer 2 - Can independently own a product feature and can handle the communication with others around it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hitting part 2 requires actually being around in some form, and having some sort of sense of ownership. This is an interesting thing to muse about because I guess it might have some ownership in the sense that parts of the codebase which are fully vibed and humans do not really <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCEmiRjPEtQ">read are fully “owned” by these tools</a>.</p>
<p>However, pragmatically, as a pairing partner with an experienced engineer constantly reviewing, amending and understanding the output - you can really treat Claude like a Pair Programming buddy with infinite time and patience, a bit too much sycophancy, and the ability to ship reasonable code given reasonable constraints in a speed I’ve not seen before.</p>
<p>And that is like a new way to build things.</p>

<p>Molly Woodworth was a kid who seemed to do well at everything: good grades, in the gifted and talented program. But she couldn't read very well.</p>
<p>"There was no rhyme or reason to reading for me," she said. "When a teacher would dictate a word and say, 'Tell me how you think you can spell it,' I sat there with my mouth open while other kids gave spellings, and I thought, 'How do they even know where to begin?' I was totally lost."</p>
<p>Woodworth went to public school in Owosso, Michigan, in the 1990s. She says sounds and letters just didn't make sense to her, and she doesn't remember anyone teaching her how to read. So she came up with her own strategies to get through text. </p>
<p>Strategy 1: Memorize as many words as possible. "Words were like pictures to me," she said. "I had a really good memory."</p>
<p>Strategy 2: Guess the words based on context. If she came across a word she didn't have in her visual memory bank, she'd look at the first letter and come up with a word that seemed to make sense. Reading was kind of like a game of 20 Questions: What word could this be?</p>
<p>Strategy 3: If all else failed, she'd skip the words she didn't know. </p>
<p>Most of the time, she could get the gist of what she was reading. But getting through text took forever. "I hated reading because it was taxing," she said. "I'd get through a chapter and my brain hurt by the end of it. I wasn't excited to learn."</p>
<p>No one knew how much she struggled, not even her parents. Her reading strategies were her "dirty little secrets." </p>

<p>Woodworth, who now works in accounting,<a id="footnote-link-1" href="#footnote-content-1">1</a> says she's still not a very good reader and tears up when she talks about it. Reading "influences every aspect of your life," she said. She's determined to make sure her own kids get off to a better start than she did.</p>
<p>That's why she was so alarmed to see how her oldest child, Claire, was being taught to read in school.</p>

<p>A couple of years ago, Woodworth was volunteering in Claire's kindergarten classroom. The class was reading a book together and the teacher was telling the children to practice the strategies that good readers use. </p>
<p>The teacher said, "If you don't know the word, just look at this picture up here," Woodworth recalled. "There was a fox and a bear in the picture. And the word was bear, and she said, 'Look at the first letter. It's a "b." Is it fox or bear?'"</p>
<p>Woodworth was stunned. "I thought, 'Oh my God, those are my strategies.' Those are the things I taught myself to look like a good reader, not the things that good readers do," she said. "These kids were being taught my dirty little secrets."</p>
<p>She went to the teacher and expressed her concerns. The teacher told her she was teaching reading the way the curriculum told her to.</p>
<p>Woodworth had stumbled on to American education's own little secret about reading: Elementary schools across the country are teaching children to be poor readers — and educators may not even know it.</p>
<p>For decades, reading instruction in American schools has been rooted in a flawed theory about how reading works, a theory that was debunked decades ago by cognitive scientists, yet remains deeply embedded in teaching practices and curriculum materials. As a result, the strategies that struggling readers use to get by — memorizing words, using context to guess words, skipping words they don't know — are the strategies that many beginning readers are taught in school. This makes it harder for many kids to learn how to read, and children who don't get off to a good start in reading find it difficult to ever master the process.<a id="footnote-link-2" href="#footnote-content-2">2</a></p>
<p>A shocking number of kids in the United States can't read very well. A third of all fourth-graders can't read at a basic level, and most students are still not proficient readers by the time they finish high school. </p>

<p>When kids struggle to learn how to read, it can lead to a downward spiral in which behavior, vocabulary, knowledge and other cognitive skills are eventually affected by slow reading development.<a id="footnote-link-3" href="#footnote-content-3">3</a>&nbsp;A disproportionate number of poor readers become high school dropouts and end up in the criminal justice system.<a id="footnote-link-4" href="#footnote-content-4">4</a></p>
<p>The fact that a disproven theory about how reading works is still driving the way many children are taught to read is part of the problem. School districts spend hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars on curriculum materials that include this theory. Teachers are taught the theory in their teacher preparation programs and on the job. As long as this disproven theory remains part of American education, many kids will likely struggle to learn how to read.</p>

<h3 id="h3_the_origins">The origins</h3>

<p>The theory is known as "three cueing." The name comes from the notion that readers use three different kinds of information — or "cues" — to identify words as they are reading.</p>
<p>The theory was first proposed in 1967, when an education professor named Ken Goodman presented a paper at the annual meeting of the American Educational Research Association in New York City.</p>
<p>In the paper,<a id="footnote-link-5" href="#footnote-content-5">5</a>&nbsp;Goodman rejected the idea that reading is a precise process that involves exact or detailed perception of letters or words. Instead, he argued that as people read, they make predictions about the words on the page using these three cues:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>graphic cues (what do the letters tell you about what the word might be?)</p></li>
<li><p>syntactic cues (what kind of word could it be, for example, a noun or a verb?)</p></li>
<li><p>semantic cues (what word would make sense here, based on the context?)</p></li>

</ul>

<p>Goodman concluded that:</p>
<p>Skill in reading involves not greater precision, but more accurate first guesses based on better sampling techniques, greater control over language structure, broadened experiences and increased conceptual development. As the child develops reading skill and speed, he uses increasingly fewer graphic cues.</p>
<p>Goodman's proposal became the theoretical basis for a new approach to teaching reading that would soon take hold in American schools. </p>
<p>Previously, the question of how to teach reading had focused on one of two basic ideas. </p>
<p>One idea is that reading is a visual memory process. The teaching method associated with this idea is known as "whole word." The whole word approach was perhaps best embodied in the "Dick and Jane" books that first appeared in the 1930s. The books rely on word repetition, and pictures to support the meaning of the text. The idea is that if you see words enough, you eventually store them in your memory as visual images.</p>

<p>The other idea is that reading requires knowledge of the relationships between sounds and letters. Children learn to read by sounding out words. This approach is known as phonics. It goes way back, popularized in the 1800s with the McGuffey readers.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.apmcdn.org/c8de3e651149802edda84446d893bdd8a7b5533c/uncropped/7c1b50-20190820-mcguffey-reader.png"></p>
<p>These two ideas — whole word and phonics — had been taking turns as the favored way to teach reading until Goodman came along with what came to be known among educators as the "three-cueing system." </p>
<p>In the cueing theory of how reading works, when a child comes to a word she doesn't know, the teacher encourages her to think of a word that makes sense and asks: Does it look right? Does it sound right? If a word checks out on the basis of those questions, the child is getting it. She's on the path to skilled reading.</p>
<p>Teachers may not know the term "three cueing," but they're probably familiar with "MSV." M stands for using meaning to figure out what a word is, S for using sentence structure and V for using visual information (i.e., the letters in the words). MSV is a cueing idea that can be traced back to the late Marie Clay, a developmental psychologist from New Zealand who first laid out her theories about reading in a dissertation in the 1960s.<a id="footnote-link-6" href="#footnote-content-6">6</a></p>
<p>Clay developed her cueing theory independently of Goodman, but they met several times and had similar ideas about the reading process. Their theories were based on observational research. They would listen to children read, note the kinds of errors they made, and use that information to identify a child's reading difficulties. For example, a child who says "horse" when the word was "house" is probably relying too much on visual, or graphic, cues. A teacher in this case would encourage the child to pay more attention to what word would make sense in the sentence. </p>
<p>Goodman and Clay believed that letters were the least reliable of the three cues, and that as people became better readers, they no longer needed to pay attention to all the letters in words. "In efficient word perception the reader relies mostly on the sentence and its meaning and some selected features of the forms of words," Clay wrote.<a id="footnote-link-7" href="#footnote-content-7">7</a>&nbsp;For Goodman, accurate word recognition was not necessarily the goal of reading. The goal was to comprehend text.<a id="footnote-link-8" href="#footnote-content-8">8</a>&nbsp;If the sentences were making sense, the reader must be getting the words right, or right enough.</p>
<p>These ideas soon became the foundation for how reading was taught in many schools. Goodman's three-cueing idea formed the theoretical basis of an approach known as "whole language" that by the late 1980s had taken hold throughout America.<a id="footnote-link-9" href="#footnote-content-9">9</a>&nbsp;Clay built her cueing ideas into a reading intervention program for struggling first-graders called Reading Recovery. It was implemented across New Zealand in the 1980s and went on to become one of the world's most widely used reading intervention programs.<a id="footnote-link-10" href="#footnote-content-10">10</a></p>
<p>But while cueing was taking hold in schools, scientists were busy studying the cognitive processes involved in reading words. And they came to different conclusions about how people read.<a id="footnote-link-11" href="#footnote-content-11">11</a></p>

<h3 id="h3_scientists_take_on_three_cueing">Scientists take on three cueing</h3>

<p>It was the early 1970s, and Keith Stanovich was working on his doctorate in psychology at the University of Michigan. He thought the reading field was ready for an infusion of knowledge from the "cognitive revolution" that was underway in psychology. Stanovich had a background in experimental science and an interest in learning and cognition due in part to the influence of his wife, Paula, who was a special education teacher.</p>
<p>Stanovich wanted to understand how people read words.<a id="footnote-link-12" href="#footnote-content-12">12</a>&nbsp;He knew about Goodman's work and thought he was probably right that as people become better readers, they relied more on their knowledge of vocabulary and language structure to read words and didn't need to pay as much attention to the letters.</p>
<p>So, in 1975, Stanovich and a fellow graduate student set out to test the idea in their lab. They recruited readers of various ages and abilities and gave them a series of word-reading tasks. Their hypothesis was that skilled readers rely more on contextual cues to recognize words than poor readers, who probably weren't as good at using context.</p>
<p>They couldn't have been more wrong. </p>
<p>"To our surprise, all of our research results pointed in the opposite direction," Stanovich wrote. "It was the poorer readers, not the more skilled readers, who were more reliant on context to facilitate word recognition."<a id="footnote-link-13" href="#footnote-content-13">13</a></p>
<p>The skilled readers could instantly recognize words without relying on context. Other researchers have confirmed these findings with similar experiments. It turns out that the ability to read words in isolation quickly and accurately is the hallmark of being a skilled reader. This is now one of the most consistent and well-replicated findings in all of reading research.<a id="footnote-link-14" href="#footnote-content-14">14</a></p>
<p>Other studies revealed further problems with the cueing theory:<a id="footnote-link-15" href="#footnote-content-15">15</a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Skilled readers don't scan words and sample from the graphic cues in an incidental way; instead, they very quickly recognize a word as a sequence of letters. That's how good readers instantly know the difference between "house" and "horse," for example.</p></li>
<li><p>Experiments that force people to use context to predict words show that even skilled readers can correctly guess only a fraction of the words; this is one reason people who rely on context to identify words are poor readers.</p></li>
<li><p>Weak word recognition skills are the most common and debilitating source of reading problems.<a id="footnote-link-16" href="#footnote-content-16">16</a></p></li>

</ul>

<p>The results of these studies are not controversial or contested among scientists who study reading. The findings have been incorporated into every major scientific model of how reading works.</p>
<p>But cueing is still alive and well in schools. </p>

<h3 id="h3_picture_power!">Picture Power!</h3>

<p>It's not hard to find examples of the cueing system. A quick search on Google, Pinterest or Teachers Pay Teachers turns up plenty of lesson plans, teaching guides and classroom posters. One popular poster has cute cartoon characters to remind children they have lots of strategies to use when they're stuck on a word, including looking at the picture (Eagle Eye), getting their lips ready to try the first sound (Lips the Fish), or just skipping the word altogether (Skippy Frog).</p>

<p>There are videos online where you can see cueing in action. In one video posted on The Teaching Channel,<a id="footnote-link-17" href="#footnote-content-17">17</a>&nbsp;a kindergarten teacher in Oakland, California, instructs her students to use "picture power" to identify the words on the page. The goal of the lesson, according to the teacher, is for the students to "use the picture and a first sound to determine an unknown word in their book."</p>
<p>The class reads a book together called "In the Garden." On each page, there's a picture of something you might find in a garden. It's what's known as a predictable book; the sentences are all the same except for the last word.</p>

<p>The children have been taught to memorize the words "look," "at," and "the." The challenge is getting the last word in the sentence. The lesson plan tells the teacher to cover up the word with a sticky note. </p>
<p>In the video, the wiggly kindergarteners sitting cross-legged on the floor come to a page with a picture of a butterfly. The teacher tells the kids that she's guessing the word is going to be butterfly. She uncovers the word to check on the accuracy of her guess. </p>
<p>"Look at that," she tells the children, pointing to the first letter of the word. "It starts with the /b/ /b/ /b/." The class reads the sentence together as the teacher points to the words. "Look at the butterfly!" they yell out excitedly.</p>
<p>This lesson comes from "Units of Study for Teaching Reading," more commonly known as "reader's workshop."<a id="footnote-link-18" href="#footnote-content-18">18</a>&nbsp;According to the lesson plan, this lesson teaches children to "know and apply grade-level phonics and word analysis skills in decoding words."<a id="footnote-link-19" href="#footnote-content-19">19</a></p>
<p>But the children were not taught to decode words in this lesson. They were taught to guess words using pictures and patterns — hallmarks of the three-cueing system.</p>
<p>The author of Units of Study for Teaching Reading, Lucy Calkins, often refers to cueing in her published work.<a id="footnote-link-20" href="#footnote-content-20">20</a>&nbsp;She uses the term MSV — the meaning, structure and visual idea that originally came from Clay in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Then there is Fountas and Pinnell Literacy, started by Irene Fountas and Gay Su Pinnell, teachers who learned the MSV concept from Clay in the 1980s.<a id="footnote-link-21" href="#footnote-content-21">21</a></p>
<p>Fountas and Pinnell have written several books about teaching reading, including a best-seller about a widely used instructional approach called "Guided Reading." They also created a reading assessment system that uses what are called "leveled books."<a id="footnote-link-22" href="#footnote-content-22">22</a>&nbsp;Children start with predictable books like "In the Garden" and move up levels as they're able to "read" the words. But many of the words in those books — butterfly, caterpillar — are words that beginning readers haven't been taught to decode yet. One purpose of the books is to teach children that when they get to a word they don't know, they can use context to figure it out.</p>
<p>When put into practice in the classroom, these approaches can cause problems for children when they are learning to read.</p>

<h3 id="h3_'that_is_not_reading'">'That is not reading'</h3>

<p>Margaret Goldberg, a teacher and literacy coach in the Oakland Unified School District, remembers a moment when she realized what a problem the three-cueing approach was. She was with a first-grader named Rodney when he came to a page with a picture of a girl licking an ice cream cone and a dog licking a bone. </p>
<p>The text said: "My little dog likes to eat with me."</p>
<p>But Rodney said: "My dog likes to lick his bone."</p>

<p>Rodney breezed right through it, unaware that he hadn't read the sentence on the page. </p>
<p>Goldberg realized lots of her students couldn't actually read the words in their books; instead, they were memorizing sentence patterns and using the pictures to guess. One little boy exclaimed, "I can read this book with my eyes shut!"</p>
<p>"Oh no," Goldberg thought. "That is not reading."</p>
<p>Goldberg had been hired by the Oakland schools in 2015 to help struggling readers by teaching a Fountas and Pinnell program called "Leveled Literacy Intervention" that uses leveled books and the cueing approach.<a id="footnote-link-23" href="#footnote-content-23">23</a></p>
<p>Around the same time, Goldberg was trained in a program that uses a different strategy for teaching children how to read words. The program is called "Systematic Instruction in Phonological Awareness, Phonics, and Sight Words," or SIPPS.<a id="footnote-link-24" href="#footnote-content-24">24</a>&nbsp;It's a phonics program that teaches children how to sound out words and uses what are known as "decodable books." Most words in the books have spelling patterns that kids have been taught in their phonics lessons.</p>
<p>Goldberg decided to teach some of her students using the phonics program and some of her students using three cueing. And she began to notice differences between the two groups of kids. "Not just in their abilities to read," she said, "but in the way they approached their reading."</p>
<p>Goldberg and a colleague recorded first-graders talking about what makes them good readers. </p>
<p>One video shows Mia, on the left, who was in the phonics program. Mia says she's a good reader because she looks at the words and sounds them out. JaBrea, on the right, was taught the cueing system. JaBrea says: "I look at the pictures and I read it."</p>

<p>It was clear to Goldberg after just a few months of teaching both approaches that the students learning phonics were doing better. "One of the things that I still struggle with is a lot of guilt," she said. </p>
<p>She thinks the students who learned three cueing were actually harmed by the approach. "I did lasting damage to these kids. It was so hard to ever get them to stop looking at a picture to guess what a word would be. It was so hard to ever get them to slow down and sound a word out because they had had this experience of knowing that you predict what you read before you read it."</p>
<p>Goldberg soon discovered the decades of scientific evidence against cueing.<a id="footnote-link-25" href="#footnote-content-25">25</a>&nbsp;She was shocked. She had never come across any of this science in her teacher preparation or on the job.</p>
<p>And she started to wonder why not.</p>

<h3 id="h3_balanced_literacy">Balanced Literacy</h3>

<p>People have been arguing for centuries about how children should be taught to read. The fight has mostly focused on whether to teach phonics.</p>
<p>The whole language movement of the late 20th century was perhaps the zenith of the anti-phonics argument.<a id="footnote-link-26" href="#footnote-content-26">26</a>&nbsp;Phonics instruction was seen as tedious, time-consuming and ultimately unnecessary. Why? Because — according to the three-cueing theory — readers can use other, more reliable cues to figure out what the words say.<a id="footnote-link-27" href="#footnote-content-27">27</a></p>
<p>Marilyn Adams came across this belief in the early 1990s. She's a cognitive and developmental psychologist who had just written a book summarizing the research on how children learn to read.<a id="footnote-link-28" href="#footnote-content-28">28</a>&nbsp;One big takeaway from the book is that becoming a skilled reader of English requires knowledge of sound-spelling correspondences.<a id="footnote-link-29" href="#footnote-content-29">29</a>&nbsp;Another big takeaway is that many kids were not being taught this in school.</p>
<p>Soon after the book was published, Adams was describing her findings to a group of teachers and state education officials in Sacramento, California. She was sensing discomfort and confusion in the room. "And I just stopped and said, 'What is it that I'm missing?'" she recalled. "'What is it that we need to talk about? Help me.'"</p>
<p>A woman raised her hand and asked: "What does this have to do with the three-cueing system?" Marilyn didn't know what the three-cueing system was. "I think I blew all of their fuses that I did not [know what it was] since this was so fundamental to being an elementary reading teacher," she said. "How could I present myself to them as an expert on reading and not know about this?"</p>
<p>The teachers drew her a Venn diagram of the three-cueing system. It looked something like this:</p>
<figure>
  <img sizes="(max-width: 47.999em) 99vw, 66vw" alt="venn" srcset="https://img.apmcdn.org/ccbe5d327ddcb469cd8d6e3b3f90994e55637a4c/uncropped/721b29-20190822-venn.png 1000w" src="https://img.apmcdn.org/ccbe5d327ddcb469cd8d6e3b3f90994e55637a4c/uncropped/721b29-20190822-venn.png">

    <span>
      &nbsp;
    </span>
    <span>&nbsp;</span>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Adams thought this diagram made perfect sense. The research clearly shows that readers use all of these cues to understand what they're reading.</p>
<p>But Adams soon figured out the disconnect. Teachers understood these cues not just as the way readers construct meaning from text, but as the way readers actually identify the words on the page. And they thought that teaching kids to decode or sound out words was not necessary.</p>
<p>"The most important thing was for the children to understand and enjoy the text," Adams said. "And from that understanding and joy of reading, the words on the page would just pop out at them."</p>
<p>She would explain to teachers at every opportunity that explicitly teaching children about the relationships between sounds and letters is essential to ensure all kids get off to a good start in reading. But she got tons of pushback from teachers. "They didn't want to teach phonics!" she recalled in frustration.</p>
<p>In 1998, Adams wrote a book chapter about how the three-cueing system conflicts with what researchers have figured out about reading. She hoped it would help put three cueing to rest.<a id="footnote-link-30" href="#footnote-content-30">30</a></p>
<p>By this time, the scientific research on reading was gaining traction. In 2000, a national panel convened by Congress to review the evidence on how to teach reading came out with a report.<a id="footnote-link-31" href="#footnote-content-31">31</a>&nbsp;It identified several essential components of reading instruction, including vocabulary, comprehension and phonics. The evidence that phonics instruction enhances children's success in learning how to read was clear and compelling. National reports on reading a few years later in the United Kingdom and Australia came to the same conclusion.<a id="footnote-link-32" href="#footnote-content-32">32</a></p>

<p>Eventually, many whole language supporters accepted the weight of the scientific evidence about the importance of phonics instruction. They started adding phonics to their books and materials and renamed their approach "balanced literacy." </p>
<p>But they didn't get rid of the three-cueing system.</p>
<p>Balanced literacy proponents will tell you their approach is a mix of phonics instruction with plenty of time for kids to read and enjoy books. But look carefully at the materials and you'll see that's not really what balanced literacy is mixing. Instead, it's mixing a bunch of different ideas about how kids learn to read. It's a little bit of whole word instruction with long lists of words for kids to memorize. It's a little bit of phonics. And fundamentally, it's the idea that children should be taught to read using the three-cueing system.</p>
<p>And it turns out cueing may actually prevent kids from focusing on words in the way they need to become skilled readers.</p>

<h3 id="h3_mapping_the_words">Mapping the words</h3>


<p>To understand why cueing can get in the way of children's reading development, it's essential to understand how our brains process the words we see. </p>
<p>Reading scientists have known for decades that the hallmark of being a skilled reader is the ability to instantly and accurately recognize words.<a id="footnote-link-33" href="#footnote-content-33">33</a>&nbsp;If you're a skilled reader, your brain has gotten so good at reading words that you process the word "chair" faster than you process a picture of a chair.<a id="footnote-link-34" href="#footnote-content-34">34</a>&nbsp;You know tens of thousands of words instantly, on sight. How did you learn to do that?</p>
<p>It happens through a process called "orthographic mapping."<a id="footnote-link-35" href="#footnote-content-35">35</a>&nbsp;This occurs when you pay attention to the details of a written word and link the word's pronunciation and meaning with its sequence of letters.<a id="footnote-link-36" href="#footnote-content-36">36</a>&nbsp;A child knows the meaning and pronunciation of "pony." The word gets mapped to his memory when he links the sounds /p/&nbsp;/o/&nbsp;/n/&nbsp;/y/ to the written word "pony."</p>
<p>That requires an awareness of the speech sounds in words and an understanding of how those sounds are represented by letters.<a id="footnote-link-37" href="#footnote-content-37">37</a>&nbsp;In other words, you need phonics skills.</p>
<p>Here's what happens when a reader who has good phonics skills comes to a word she doesn't recognize in print. She stops at the word and sounds it out. If it's a word she knows the meaning of, she has now linked the spelling of the word with its pronunciation. If she doesn't know the meaning of the word, she can use context to try to figure it out.</p>
<p>By about second grade, a typically developing reader needs just a few exposures to a word through understanding both the pronunciation and the spelling for that word to be stored in her memory.<a id="footnote-link-38" href="#footnote-content-38">38</a>&nbsp;She doesn't know that word because she memorized it as a visual image. She knows that word because at some point she successfully sounded it out. </p>
<p>The more words she stores in her memory this way, the more she can focus on the meaning of what she's reading; she'll eventually be using less brain power to identify words and will be able to devote more brain power to comprehending what she's reading.<a id="footnote-link-39" href="#footnote-content-39">39</a></p>
<p>But when children don't have good phonics skills, the process is different. </p>
<p>"They sample from the letters because they're not good at sounding them out," said David Kilpatrick, a psychology professor at SUNY Cortland and the author of a book about preventing reading difficulties.<a id="footnote-link-40" href="#footnote-content-40">40</a>&nbsp;"And they use context."</p>
<p>In other words, when people don't have good phonics skills, they use the cueing system. </p>
<p>"The three-cueing system is the way poor readers read," said Kilpatrick.</p>
<p>And if teachers use the cueing system to teach reading, Kilpatrick says they're not just teaching children the habits of poor readers, they are actually impeding the orthographic mapping process.<a id="footnote-link-41" href="#footnote-content-41">41</a></p>
<p>"The minute you ask them just to pay attention to the first letter or look at the picture, look at the context, you're drawing their attention away from the very thing that they need to interact with in order for them to read the word [and] remember the word," Kilpatrick said. In this way, he said, three cueing can actually prevent the critical learning that's necessary for a child to become a skilled reader. </p>
<p>In many balanced literacy classrooms, children are taught phonics and the cueing system. Some kids who are taught both approaches realize pretty quickly that sounding out a word is the most efficient and reliable way to know what it is. Those kids tend to have an easier time understanding the ways that sounds and letters relate. They'll drop the cueing strategies and begin building that big bank of instantly known words that is so necessary for skilled reading.</p>
<p>But some children will skip the sounding out if they're taught they have other options. Phonics is challenging for many kids. The cueing strategies seem quicker and easier at first. And by using context and memorizing a bunch of words, many children can look like good readers — until they get to about third grade, when their books begin to have more words, longer words, and fewer pictures. Then they're stuck. They haven't developed their sounding-out skills. Their bank of known words is limited. Reading is slow and laborious and they don't like it, so they don't do it if they don't have to. While their peers who mastered decoding early are reading and teaching themselves new words every day, the kids who clung to the cueing approach are falling further and further behind.<a id="footnote-link-42" href="#footnote-content-42">42</a></p>
<p>These poor reading habits, once ingrained at a young age, can follow kids into high school. Some kids who were taught the cueing approach never become good readers. Not because they're incapable of learning to read well but because they were taught the strategies of struggling readers.</p>

<h3 id="h3_'so_what_if_they_use_the_picture%3F'">'So what if they use the picture?'</h3>

<p>Once Margaret Goldberg discovered the cognitive science evidence against cueing, she wanted her colleagues in the Oakland school district to know about it too.</p>
<p>Over the past two years, Goldberg and a fellow literacy coach named Lani Mednick have been leading a grant-funded pilot project to improve reading achievement in the Oakland schools.<a id="footnote-link-43" href="#footnote-content-43">43</a></p>
<p>They have their work cut out for them. Nearly half the district's third-graders are below grade level in reading. Goldberg and Mednick want to raise questions about how kids in Oakland are being <em>taught</em> to read. </p>
<p>They meet every couple weeks with literacy coaches from the 10 elementary schools in the pilot program. They read and discuss articles about the scientific research on reading. At a meeting in March, the coaches watched the video of the "picture power" lesson.</p>
<p>"This teacher meant well," Mednick said to the coaches after they watched the lesson. "It seemed like she believed this lesson would ensure her students would be on the road toward reading."</p>
<p>Mednick wanted the coaches to consider the beliefs about reading that would lead to the creation of a lesson like "picture power." The Oakland schools purchased the Units of Study for Teaching Reading series, which includes the "picture power" lesson, as part of a balanced literacy initiative the district began about 10 years ago. The district also bought the Fountas and Pinnell assessment system. </p>
<p>The coaches saw right away that "picture power" was designed to teach kids the cueing system. But they said many teachers don't see any problem with cueing. After all, one of the cues is to look at the letters in the word. What's wrong with teaching kids lots of different strategies to figure out unknown words?<a id="footnote-link-44" href="#footnote-content-44">44</a></p>
<p>"I remember before we started looking at the science and everything, I thought to myself, 'Reading is so hard for kids, so what if they use the picture?'" said Soraya Sajous-Brooks, the early literacy coach at Prescott Elementary School in West Oakland. "Like, use everything you've got."</p>
<p>But she's come to understand that cueing sends the message to kids that they don't need to sound out words. Her students would get phonics instruction in one part of the day. Then they'd go reader's workshop and be taught that when they come to a word they don't know, they have lots of strategies. They can sound it out. They can also check the first letter, look at the picture, think of a word that makes sense.</p>
<p>Teaching cueing <em>and</em> phonics doesn't work, Sajous-Brooks said. "One negates the other."</p>
<p>Goldberg and Mednick want to show the district there's a better way to teach reading. Schools in the pilot project used grant money to buy new materials that steer clear of the three-cueing idea. Two charter school networks in Oakland are working on similar projects to move their schools away from cueing. </p>
<p>To see what it looks like, I visited a first-grade classroom at a charter school in Oakland called Achieve Academy.<a id="footnote-link-45" href="#footnote-content-45">45</a></p>
<p>One part of the day was explicit phonics instruction.<a id="footnote-link-46" href="#footnote-content-46">46</a>&nbsp;The students were divided into small groups based on their skill level. They met with their teacher, Andrea Ruiz, at a kidney-shaped table in a corner of the classroom. The lowest-level group worked on identifying the speech sounds in words like "skin" and "skip." The highest-level group learned how verbs like "spy" and "cry" are spelled as "spied' and 'cried" in the past tense.</p>

<p>There were also vocabulary lessons.<a id="footnote-link-47" href="#footnote-content-47">47</a>&nbsp;The entire class gathered on a rug at the front of the classroom to talk about a book Ms. Ruiz read out loud to them. One of the words in the book was "prey."</p>
<p>"What animals are a chameleon's prey?" Ms. Ruiz asked the children. "Or we can also ask, what animals do chameleons hunt for food?"</p>
<p>The kids turned and talked to each other. "A chameleon's prey are bugs and insects and other chameleons and mice and birds," a little boy explained to his classmate. "That's it."</p>
<p>Other vocabulary words these first-graders had learned were posted on cards around the classroom. They included: wander, persevere, squint and scrumptious. The kids weren't expected to read those words yet. The idea is to build their oral vocabulary so that when they <em>can</em> read those words, they know what the words mean. </p>
<p>This comes straight from the scientific research, which shows that reading comprehension is the product of two things.<a id="footnote-link-48" href="#footnote-content-48">48</a>&nbsp;First, a child needs to be able to sound out a word. Second, the child needs to know the meaning of the word she just sounded out. So, in a first-grade classroom that's following the research, you will see explicit phonics instruction and also lessons that build oral vocabulary and background knowledge. And you will see kids practicing what they've been taught.</p>
<p>After their vocabulary lesson, the kids did "buddy reading." They retreated to various spots around the classroom to read books to each other. I found Belinda sitting on an adult chair at the back of the classroom, her little legs swinging. Across from her was her buddy Steven, decked out in a yellow and blue plaid shirt tucked neatly into his jeans. He held the book and pointed to the words while Belinda read. </p>
<p>"Ellen /m/," Belinda paused, sounding out the word "meets." She was reading a decodable book about some kids who visit a farm. Almost all of the words in the book contain spelling patterns she'd been taught in her phonics lessons. </p>
<p>"I am a farm here," Belinda read. </p>
<p>Steven did a double-take. "A farmer here," he said gently. Steven's job as Belinda's reading buddy was to help her if she missed a word or got stuck. But that didn't happen much because Belinda had been taught how to read the words. She didn't need any help from the pictures, either. She barely glanced at them as she read.</p>

<p>To be clear, there's nothing wrong with pictures. They're great to look at and talk about, and they can help a child comprehend the meaning of a story. Context — including a picture if there is one — helps us understand what we're reading all the time. But if a child is being taught to use context to identify words, she's being taught to read like a poor reader.</p>
<p>Many educators don't know this because the cognitive science research has not made its way into many schools and schools of education.<a id="footnote-link-49" href="#footnote-content-49">49</a></p>
<p>Ruiz didn't know about this research until the Oakland pilot project. "I didn't really know anything about how kids learn to read when I started teaching," she said. It was a relief when she came to Oakland and the curriculum spelled out that kids use meaning, structure and visual cues to figure out words. "Because I came from not having anything, I was like, 'Oh, there's a way we should teach this,'" she said.</p>
<p>I heard this from other educators. Cueing was appealing because they didn't know what else to do. </p>
<p>"When I got into the classroom and someone told me to use this practice, I didn't question it," said Stacey Cherny, a former teacher who's now principal of an elementary school in Pennsylvania. She says many teachers aren't taught what they need to know about the structure of the English language to be able to teach phonics well. She says phonics can be intimidating; three cueing isn't. </p>
<p>Another reason cueing holds on is that it seems to work for some children. But researchers estimate there's a percentage of kids — perhaps about 40 percent — who will learn to read no matter how they're taught.<a id="footnote-link-50" href="#footnote-content-50">50</a>&nbsp;According to Kilpatrick, children who learn to read with cueing are succeeding in spite of the instruction, not because of it.</p>
<p>Goldberg hopes the pilot project in Oakland will convince the district to drop all instructional materials that include cueing.</p>
<p>When asked about this, the Oakland superintendent's office responded with a written statement that there isn't enough evidence from the pilot project to make curriculum changes for the entire district and that the Oakland schools remain committed to balanced literacy. </p>
<p>Oakland's situation is no different from many other districts across the country that have invested millions of dollars in materials that include cueing. </p>
<p>"It feels like everyone's trusting somebody else to have done their due diligence," Goldberg said. "Classroom teachers are trusting that the materials they're being handed will work. The people who purchase the materials are trusting if they were on the market, that they will work. We're all trusting, and it's a system that is broken."</p>

<h3 id="h3_'my_science_is_different'">'My science is different'</h3>

<p>If cueing was debunked decades ago by cognitive scientists, why is the idea still in materials that are being sold to schools? </p>
<p>One answer to that question is that school districts still buy the materials. Heinemann, the company that publishes the Fountas and Pinnell and Lucy Calkins' products that the Oakland schools use, earned somewhere in the neighborhood of $500 million in 2018, according to earnings reports.<a id="footnote-link-51" href="#footnote-content-51">51</a></p>
<p>I wanted to know what the authors of those materials make of the cognitive science research. And I wanted to give them a chance to explain the ideas behind their work. I wrote to Calkins, Fountas and Pinnell and asked for interviews. They all declined. Heinemann sent a statement that said every product the company sells is informed by extensive research.</p>
<p>I also asked Ken Goodman for an interview. It's been more than 50 years since he first laid out the three-cueing theory in that 1967 paper. I wanted to know what he thinks of the cognitive science research. Of the major proponents of three cueing I reached out to, he was the only one who agreed to an interview. </p>
<p>I visited Goodman at his home in Tucson, Arizona. He's 91. He uses a scooter to get around, but he's still working. He just finished a new edition of one of his books.</p>

<p>When I asked him what he makes of the cognitive science research, he told me he thinks scientists focus too much on word recognition. He still doesn't believe accurate word recognition is necessary for reading comprehension.</p>
<p>"Word recognition is a preoccupation," he said. "I don't teach word recognition. I teach people to make sense of language. And learning the words is incidental to that."</p>
<p>He brought up the example of a child who comes to the word "horse" and says "pony" instead. His argument is that a child will still understand the meaning of the story because horse and pony are the same concept. </p>
<p>I pressed him on this. First of all, a pony isn't the same thing as a horse. Second, don't you want to make sure that when a child is learning to read, he understands that /p/&nbsp;/o/&nbsp;/n/&nbsp;/y/ says "pony"? And different letters say "horse"?</p>
<p>He dismissed my question. </p>
<p>"The purpose is not to learn words," he said. "The purpose is to make sense." </p>
<p>Cognitive scientists don't dispute that the purpose of reading is to make sense of the text. But the question is: How can you understand what you are reading if you can't accurately read the words? And if quick and accurate word recognition is the hallmark of being a skilled reader, how does a little kid get there?</p>
<p>Goodman rejected the idea that you can make a distinction between skilled readers and unskilled readers; he doesn't like the value judgment that implies. He said dyslexia does not exist — despite lots of evidence that it does.<a id="footnote-link-52" href="#footnote-content-52">52</a>&nbsp;And he said the three-cueing theory is based on years of observational research. In his view, three cueing is perfectly valid, drawn from a different kind of evidence than what scientists collect in their labs.</p>
<p>"My science is different," Goodman said.</p>
<p>This idea that there are different kinds of evidence that lead to different conclusions about how reading works is one reason people continue to disagree about how children should be taught to read. It's important for educators to understand that three cueing is based on theory and observational research and that there's decades of scientific evidence from labs all over the world that converges on a very different idea about skilled reading.</p>
<p>The cognitive science does not provide all the answers about how to teach children to read, but on the question of how skilled readers read words, scientists have amassed a huge body of evidence.</p>
<p>Goldberg thinks it's time for educators across the country to take a close look at all the materials they use to teach reading. </p>
<p>"We should look through the materials and search for evidence of cueing," she said. "And if it's there, don't touch it. Don't let it get near our kids, don't let it get near our classrooms, our teachers."</p>
