Inside each of the two 'Thinking Rooms,' a single armchair is surrounded by thick curtains made of blue velvet — a nod to Lynch’s 1986 film Blue Velvet. 'At the beginning, there was only one big armchair inside the room. And I realised it was exactly like an image from one of his films,' says Monda of the scenography.</p><p>Above the chair, a series of brass tubes rise towards a curving gold ceiling. While around the perimeter, screens playing abstract videos act like portals to the outside world. According to Monda, Lynch posits the installation as a moment of respite and reflection from the frenetic pace outside on the Fiera floor. To construct the sets, Monda and Lynch worked with the set builders at Milan’s Piccolo Teatro.</p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check=""><div><p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XjDqSXDkvQBVceLropEs3C-1920-80.jpg.webp 1920w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XjDqSXDkvQBVceLropEs3C-1600-80.jpg.webp 1600w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XjDqSXDkvQBVceLropEs3C-1280-80.jpg.webp 1280w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XjDqSXDkvQBVceLropEs3C-1024-80.jpg.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XjDqSXDkvQBVceLropEs3C-768-80.jpg.webp 768w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XjDqSXDkvQBVceLropEs3C-415-80.jpg.webp 415w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XjDqSXDkvQBVceLropEs3C-360-80.jpg.webp 360w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XjDqSXDkvQBVceLropEs3C-320-80.jpg.webp 320w" sizes="(min-width: 710px) 670px, calc(100vw - 30px)"><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XjDqSXDkvQBVceLropEs3C-320-80.jpg" alt="Interiors of David Lynch Thinking Room" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XjDqSXDkvQBVceLropEs3C-1920-80.jpg 1920w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XjDqSXDkvQBVceLropEs3C-1600-80.jpg 1600w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XjDqSXDkvQBVceLropEs3C-1280-80.jpg 1280w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XjDqSXDkvQBVceLropEs3C-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XjDqSXDkvQBVceLropEs3C-768-80.jpg 768w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XjDqSXDkvQBVceLropEs3C-415-80.jpg 415w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XjDqSXDkvQBVceLropEs3C-360-80.jpg 360w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XjDqSXDkvQBVceLropEs3C-320-80.jpg 320w" sizes="(min-width: 710px) 670px, calc(100vw - 30px)" loading="lazy" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XjDqSXDkvQBVceLropEs3C.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XjDqSXDkvQBVceLropEs3C.jpg"></picture></p></div><p>(Image credit: Courtesy of David Lynch and Salone del Mobile)</p></figure><p>'This the first time that I do these kinds of things and it was a lot of fun,' Monda reflects on the project.

<p><em><mark>“The word for world is forest” —&nbsp;Ursula K. Le Guin</mark></em></p>



<p>In the late 18th century, officials in Prussia and Saxony began to rearrange their complex, diverse forests into straight rows of single-species trees. Forests had been sources of food, grazing, shelter, medicine, bedding and more for the people who lived in and around them, but to the early modern state, they were simply a source of timber.</p>



<p>So-called “scientific forestry,” was that century’s growth hacking: it made timber yields easier to count, predict and harvest, and meant owners no longer relied on skilled local foresters to manage forests. They were replaced with lower-skilled laborers following basic algorithmic instructions to keep the monocrop tidy, the understory bare.</p>



<p>Information and decision-making power now flowed straight to the top. Decades later when the first crop was felled, vast fortunes were made, tree by standardized tree. The clear-felled forests were replanted, ready to extend the boom. Readers of the American political anthropologist of <a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/james-c-scott-two-cheers-for-anarchism" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">anarchy</a> and order, James C. Scott, know <a href="https://files.libcom.org/files/Seeing%20Like%20a%20State%20-%20James%20C.%20Scott.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">what happened</a> next.</p>



<p>It was a disaster so bad that a new word, <em>Waldsterben</em>, or “forest death,” was minted to describe the result. All the same species and age, the trees were flattened in storms, ravaged by insects and disease — even the survivors were spindly and weak. Forests were now so tidy and bare they were all but dead. The first magnificent bounty had not been the beginning of endless riches, but a one-off harvesting of millennia of soil wealth built up by biodiversity and symbiosis. Complexity was the goose that laid golden eggs, and she had been slaughtered.</p>



<p>The story of German scientific forestry transmits a timeless truth: When we simplify complex systems, we destroy them, and the devastating consequences sometimes aren’t obvious until it’s too late.</p>



<p>That impulse to scour away the messiness that makes life resilient is what many conservation biologists <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2386849" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">call</a> the “pathology of command and control.” Today, the same drive to centralize, control and extract has driven the internet to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/21/opinion/internet-aging-gen-z.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">same fate</a> as the ravaged forests.</p>



<p>The internet’s 2010s, its boom years, may have been the first glorious harvest that exhausted a one-time bonanza of diversity. The complex web of human interactions that thrived on the internet’s initial technological diversity is now corralled into globe-spanning <a href="https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/data-shared-sold-whats-done/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">data-extraction</a> engines making huge fortunes for a tiny few.</p>



<p>Our online spaces are not ecosystems, though tech firms love <a href="https://crookedtimber.org/2022/12/08/your-platform-is-not-an-ecosystem/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">that word</a>. They’re plantations; highly concentrated and controlled environments, closer kin to the industrial farming of the cattle feedlot or battery chicken farms that madden the creatures trapped within.</p>



<p>We all know this. We see it each time we reach for our phones. But what most people have missed is how this concentration reaches deep into the internet’s infrastructure — the pipes and protocols, cables and networks, search engines and browsers. These structures determine how we build and use the internet, now and in the future.</p>



<p>They’ve concentrated into a series of near-planetary duopolies: For example, as of April 2024, Google and Apple’s internet browsers have <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">captured</a> almost 85% of the world market share, Microsoft and Apple’s two desktop operating systems over<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/268237/global-market-share-held-by-operating-systems-since-2009/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"> 80%</a>. Google <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-host-market-share" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">runs</a> 84% of global search and Microsoft 3%. Slightly more than half of all phones <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/vendor-market-share/mobile" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">come from</a> Apple and Samsung, while over 99% of mobile operating systems <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/mobile/worldwide" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">run on</a> Google or Apple software.<sup> </sup>Two cloud computing providers, Amazon Web Services and Microsoft’s Azure <a href="https://www.hava.io/blog/2024-cloud-market-share-analysis-decoding-industry-leaders-and-trends#:~:text=Amazon%20Web%20Services%20(AWS)%20maintains,in%20the%20Asia%2DPacific%20market." data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">make up</a> over 50% of the global market. Apple and Google’s email clients <a href="https://www.litmus.com/email-client-market-share" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">manage</a> nearly 90% of global email. Google and Cloudflare serve around 50% of global domain name system requests.</p>



<p>Two kinds of everything may be enough to fill a fictional ark and repopulate a ruined world, but can’t run an open, global “network of networks” where everyone has the same chance to innovate and compete. No wonder internet engineer Leslie Daigle <a href="https://www.thinkingcat.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2019-InvariantsUpdated.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">termed</a> the concentration and consolidation of the internet’s technical architecture “‘climate change’ of the Internet ecosystem.”</p>



<h2 id="h-walled-gardens-have-deep-roots"><strong>Walled Gardens Have Deep Roots</strong></h2>



<p>The internet made the tech giants possible. Their services have scaled globally, via its open, interoperable core. But for the past decade, they’ve also worked to enclose the varied, competing and often open-source or collectively provided services the internet is built on into their proprietary domains. Although this improves their operational efficiency it also ensures the flourishing conditions of their own emergence aren’t repeated by potential competitors. For tech giants, the long period of open internet evolution is over. Their internet is not an ecosystem. It’s a zoo.</p>



<p>Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Meta are consolidating their control deep into the underlying infrastructure through acquisitions, vertical integration, building proprietary networks, creating chokepoints and concentrating functions from different technical layers into a single silo of top-down control. They can afford to, using the vast wealth reaped in their one-off harvest of collective, global wealth.</p>

<p>Taken together,&nbsp;the enclosure of infrastructure and imposition of technology monoculture forecloses our futures. Internet people like to talk about “the stack,” or the layered architecture of protocols, software and hardware, operated by different service providers that collectively delivers the daily miracle of connection. It’s a complicated, dynamic system with a basic value baked into the core design; key functions are kept separate to ensure resilience, generality and create room for innovation.</p>



<p><a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/distributed-computing/html/history.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Initially</a> funded by the U.S. military and designed by academic researchers to function in wartime, the internet evolved to work anywhere, in any condition, operated by anyone who wanted to connect. But what was a dynamic, ever-evolving game of Tetris with distinct “<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mcfadden-cnsldtn-effects/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">players” and “layers</a>” is today hardening into a continent-spanning system of compacted tectonic plates. Infrastructure is not just what we see on the surface; it’s the forces below, that make mountains and power tsunamis. Whoever controls infrastructure determines the future. If you doubt that, consider that in Europe we’re still using the roads and living in many towns and cities the Roman Empire mapped out 2,000 years ago.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2019, some internet engineers in the global standards-setting body, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), raised the alarm. Daigle, a respected engineer who had previously chaired its oversight committee and internet architecture board, <a href="https://www.thinkingcat.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2019-InvariantsUpdated.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> in a policy brief that consolidation meant network structures were ossifying throughout the stack, making incumbents harder to dislodge and violating a core principle of the internet: that it does not create “permanent favorites.” Consolidation doesn’t just squeeze out competition. It narrows the kinds of relationships possible between operators of different services. </p>



<p>As Daigle put it: “The more proprietary solutions are built and deployed instead of collaborative open standards-based ones, the less the internet survives as a platform for future innovation.” Consolidation kills collaboration between service providers through the stack by rearranging an array of different relationships — competitive, collaborative — into a single predatory one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since then, standards development organizations (SDOs) started several initiatives to name and tackle infrastructure consolidation, but these floundered. Bogged down in technical minutiae, unable to separate themselves from their employers’ interests and deeply held professional values of <a href="https://archive.org/details/whatengineerskno0000vinc" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">simplification and control</a>, most internet engineers simply couldn’t see the forest for the trees.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Up close, internet concentration seems too intricate to untangle; from far away, it seems too difficult to deal with. But what if we thought of the internet not as a doomsday “<a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Hyperobjects.html?id=qu5zDwAAQBAJ&amp;source=kp_book_description" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">hyperobject</a>,” but as a damaged and struggling ecosystem facing destruction? What if we looked at it not with helpless horror at the eldritch encroachment of its current controllers, but with compassion, constructiveness and hope?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Technologists are great at incremental fixes, but to regenerate entire habitats we need to learn from ecologists who take a whole-systems view. Ecologists know something just as important, too; how to keep going when others first ignore you and then say it’s too late, how to mobilize and work collectively, and how to build pockets of diversity and resilience that will outlast them, creating possibilities for an abundant future they can imagine but never control. We don’t need to repair the internet’s infrastructure. We need to rewild it.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-rewilding"><strong>What Is Rewilding?</strong></h2>



<p>Rewilding “aims to restore healthy ecosystems by creating wild, biodiverse spaces,” <a href="https://www.iucn.org/resources/issues-brief/benefits-and-risks-rewilding" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">according</a> to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. More ambitious and risk-tolerant than traditional conservation, it targets entire ecosystems to make space for complex food webs and the emergence of unexpected interspecies relations. It’s less interested in saving specific endangered species. Individual species are just ecosystem components, and focusing on components loses sight of the whole. Ecosystems flourish through multiple points of contact between their many elements, just like computer networks. And like in computer networks, ecosystem interactions are multifaceted and generative.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rewilding has much to offer people who care about the internet. As Paul Jepson and Cain Blythe wrote in <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262046763/rewilding/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">their book</a> “Rewilding: The Radical New Science of Ecological Recovery,” rewilding pays attention “to the emergent properties of interactions between ‘things’ in ecosystems … a move from linear to systems thinking.”</p>



<p>It’s a fundamentally cheerful and workmanlike approach to what can seem insoluble problems. It doesn’t micromanage. It creates room for “ecological processes [which] foster complex and self-organizing ecosystems.” Rewilding puts into practice what every good manager knows: hire the best people you can, provide what they need to thrive, then get out of the way. It’s the opposite of command-and-control.</p>

      “Rewilding the internet is more than a metaphor. It’s a framework and plan.”    </p>

    
    
  </div>




<p>Rewilding the internet is more than a metaphor. It’s a framework and plan. It gives us fresh eyes for the wicked problem of extraction and control, and new means and allies to fix it. It recognizes that ending internet monopolies isn’t just an intellectual problem. It’s an emotional one. It answers questions like how do we keep going when the monopolies have more money and power? How do we act collectively when they suborn our community spaces, funding and networks? And how do we communicate to our allies what fixing it will look and feel like?</p>



<p>Rewilding is a positive vision for the networks we want to live inside, and a shared story for how we get there. It grafts a new tree onto technology’s tired old stock. And embodied in rewilding’s ecological tools is the collective wisdom of an entire discipline already tackling humanity’s toughest, systemic problems.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-ecology-knows"><strong>What Ecology Knows</strong></h2>



<p>Ecology knows plenty about complex systems that technologists can benefit from learning. First, it knows that <a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fee.1794" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><strong>shifting baselines</strong></a><strong> are real.</strong></p>



<p>If you were born around the 1970s, you probably remember many more dead insects on the windscreen of your parents’ car than on your own; global land-dwelling insect populations are <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aax9931" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">dropping</a> about 9% a decade. If you’re a geek, you probably programmed your own computer to make basic games. You certainly remember a web with more to read than the <a href="https://theconversation.com/we-spent-six-years-scouring-billions-of-links-and-found-the-web-is-both-expanding-and-shrinking-159215" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">same five</a> websites. You may have even written your own blog.</p>



<p>But many people born after 2000 probably think a world with few insects, little ambient noise from birdcalls, where you regularly use only a few social media and messaging apps (rather than a whole <em>web</em>) is normal. As Jepson and Blythe wrote, shifting baselines are “where each generation assumes the nature they experienced in their youth to be normal and unwittingly accepts the declines and damage of the generations before.” Damage is already baked in. It even seems natural.</p>



<p>Ecology knows that shifting baselines dampen collective urgency and deepen generational divides. People who care about internet monoculture and control are often told they’re nostalgists harkening back to a pioneer era. But it’s fiendishly hard to regenerate an open and competitive infrastructure for younger generations who’ve been raised to assume that two or three platforms, two app stores, two operating systems, two browsers, one cloud/mega-store and a single search engine for the world comprise <em>the internet</em>. If the internet for you is the massive sky-scraping silo you happen to live inside and the only thing you can see outside is the single, other massive sky-scraping silo, then how can you imagine anything else?</p>



<p>The answer isn’t to make everyone learn about how the original protocols were designed to separate key functions and the power that goes with them (though that’s certainly good to <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/4216/Designing-an-Internet" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">know</a>). It’s to change how we feel and react to living inside a complex system that needs our care. Tech toxicity stems from there being only one business model for <em>how to internet</em>: concentration, surveillance, control. Further centralizing and managing this broken system will only make it worse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rewilding the internet is not a nostalgia project for middle-aged nerds who miss IRC and Usenet. For many people across the generations today, platforms like Facebook or TikTok <em>are</em> the internet. They’ve long dwelled in walled gardens they think are the world. Concentrated digital power produces the same symptoms that command and control produces in biological ecosystems; acute distress punctuated by sudden collapses once tipping points are reached. Rewilding is a way to collectively see the counterintuitive truth; today’s internet isn’t <em>too wild</em>, even if it feels like that. It’s simply not wild <em>enough.</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s important to share that ecological rewilding is a work in progress. What do you rewild <em>to</em>? Humans have shaped and cultivated landscapes for tens of thousands of years, so what does “wild” even mean? Just as there’s no ecosystem on Earth untouched by human actions, there’s no “true” wildness to return habitats to. And what scale is needed for rewilding to succeed? It’s one thing to <a href="https://www.yellowstonepark.com/things-to-do/wildlife/wolf-reintroduction-changes-ecosystem/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">reintroduce</a> wolves to the 3,472 square miles of Yellowstone, quite another to cordon off about 20 square miles of a reclaimed polder near Amsterdam. Large and diverse Yellowstone is likely complex enough to adapt to change, but the small Dutch reserve known as Oostvaardersplassen has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jun/21/pioneering-dutch-rewilding-project-oostvaardersplassen-works-to-rebuild-controversial-reputation-aoe" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">struggled</a>.</p>

      “For tech giants, the long period of open internet evolution is over. Their internet is not an ecosystem. It’s a zoo.”    </p>

    
    
  </div>




<p>In the 1980s, the Dutch government attempted to regenerate a section of the overgrown Oostvaardersplassen. An independent-minded government ecologist, Frans Vera, said reeds and scrub would dominate unless now-extinct herbivores grazed them. In place of ancient aurochs, the state forest management agency introduced the <a href="https://www.popsci.com/nazi-bred-cows-are-too-ferocious-farm/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">famously bad-tempered</a> German Heck cattle, and in place of an extinct steppe pony, a Polish semi-feral breed.</p>



<p>Some 30 years on, with no natural predators, and after plans for a wildlife corridor to another reserve came to nothing, there were many more animals than the limited winter vegetation could sustain. People were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/27/dutch-rewilding-experiment-backfires-as-thousands-of-animals-starve" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">horrified</a> by starving cows and ponies, and beginning in 2018, government agencies instituted animal welfare checks and culling or removals.</p>



<p>Just turning the clock back was insufficient. The segment of Oostvaardersplassen was too small and too disconnected to be rewilded. Its effectively landlocked status made over-grazing and collapse inevitable, an embarrassing but necessary lesson. Rewilding is a work in progress. It’s not about trying to revert ecosystems to a mythical Eden. Instead, rewilders seek to rebuild resilience by restoring autonomous natural processes and letting them operate at scale to generate complexity. But rewilding, itself a human intervention, can take several turns to get right. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Whatever we do, the internet isn’t returning to old-school then-common interfaces like FTP and Gopher, or each organization running its own mail server, rather than operating off G-Suite. But shifting baselines mean that everyone using it today needs a shared way to articulate what’s happening, and a collective sense of purpose and possibility.</p>



<p>Some of what we need is already here, especially on the web. Look at the resurgence of RSS feeds, email newsletters and blogs as we discover (yet again) that relying on one app to host global conversations creates a single point of failure and control. New systems are growing, like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24063290/fediverse-explained-activitypub-social-media-open-protocol" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Fediverse</a> with its federated islands, or Bluesky with <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/3-30-2023-algorithmic-choice" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">algorithmic choice</a> and <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/4-13-2023-moderation" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">composable moderation</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We don’t know what the future holds. Our job is to keep open as much opportunity as we can, trusting that those who come later will use it. Rewilding gets this. Instead of setting purity tests for which kind of internet is most like the original, we can test changes against the values of the original design.&nbsp; Do new standards protect the network’s “generality,” i.e. its ability to support multiple uses, or is functionality limited to optimize efficiency for the biggest tech firms? The internet is the technological expression of hard-won human wisdom; general-purpose systems are the most resilient, and it’s risky to concentrate information and control.</p>



<p>Ecologists also know that <strong>complexity is not the enemy, it’s the goal. </strong>The story of scientific forestry shows the conflict isn’t just between duopoly platforms and everyone else; it’s between a brittle, command-and-control mentality, and the ability to have faith in complex systems that may produce things you didn’t foresee for people you don’t control.</p>



<p>As early as 1985, plant ecologists Steward T.A. Pickett and Peter S. White <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780125545204/the-ecology-of-natural-disturbance-and-patch-dynamics#book-info" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> in “The Ecology of Natural Disturbance and Patch Dynamics,” that “[an] essential paradox of wilderness conservation is that we seek to preserve what must change.” Some internet engineers know this. David Clark, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor who worked on some of the internet’s earliest protocols, <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262547703/designing-an-internet/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> an entire book about other network architectures that might have been built, if different values, like security or centralized management, had been prioritized by the internet’s creators.</p>



<p>But our internet took off because it was designed as a general-purpose network, built to connect anyone. Our internet was built to be complex and unbiddable, to do things we cannot yet imagine. When we interviewed Clark for rewilding project, he told us that “‘complex’ implies a system in which you have emergent behavior, a system in which you can’t model the outcomes. Your intuitions may be wrong. But a system that’s too simple means lost opportunities.”<sup> </sup>Or, as Daigle wrote in that 2019 <a href="https://www.thinkingcat.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2019-InvariantsUpdated.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">policy brief</a>, “simplicity is not always the best outcome.” Everything worthwhile we collectively make is complex or, honestly, messy. The cracks are where new people and ideas get in.</p>



<p>Internet infrastructure is a degraded ecosystem, but it’s also a built environment, like a city. Its complexity and unpredictability make it generative, worthwhile and deeply human. In 1961, Jane Jacobs, an American-Canadian activist and author of “The Death and Life of Great American Cities,” <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/86058/the-death-and-life-of-great-american-cities-by-jane-jacobs/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">argued</a> that mixed-use neighborhoods were safer, happier, more prosperous, and <a href="https://savingplaces.org/stories/a-tale-of-two-planners-jane-jacobs-and-robert-moses" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">more livable than</a> the sterile, highly controlling designs of urban planners like New York’s Robert Moses.</p>

      “Crashes, fires and floods may simply be entropy in action, but systemically concentrated and risky infrastructures are choices made manifest —&nbsp;and we can make better ones.”    </p>

    
    
  </div>




<p>Both Jacobs and the anthropologist Scott showed that top-down planning is often disastrous because instead of setting the stage for generative interactions it tries to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-09/robert-moses-and-his-racist-parkway-explained" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">control</a> what people will do. Just like the crime-ridden, Corbusier-like towers Moses crammed people into when he demolished mixed-use neighborhoods and built highways through them, today’s top-down, concentrated internet is, for many, an unpleasant and harmful place. Its owners are hard to remove, and their interests do not align with ours.</p>



<p>As Jacobs wrote: “As in all Utopias, the right to have plans of any significance belonged only to the planners in charge.”<sup> </sup>As a top-down, built environment, the internet has become something that is done to us, not something we collectively remake every day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an ecosystem, everything <a href="https://berjon.com/internet-transition/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">is infrastructure for</a> everything else. Ecosystems endure because species serve as checks and balances on each other. They have different modes of interaction, not just extraction, but mutualism, commensalism, competition and predation. In flourishing ecosystems, predators are subject to <a href="https://www.livingwithwolves.org/wolf-science-weekly/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">limits</a>. They’re just one part of a complex web that passes calories around, not a one-way ticket to the end of evolution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ecologists know that <strong>diversity is resilience</strong>.</p>



<p>On July 18, 2001, 11 carriages of a 60-car freight train <a href="https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/RAB0408.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">derailed</a> in the Howard Street Tunnel under Mid-Town Belvedere, a neighborhood just north of downtown Baltimore. Within minutes one carriage containing a highly flammable chemical was punctured. The escaping chemical ignited and soon adjacent carriages were alight in a fire that took about five days to put out. The disaster multiplied and spread. Thick, brick tunnel walls <a href="https://tsapps.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=900095" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">acted like</a> an oven, and temperatures rose to nearly 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit. A more than three-foot-wide water main above the tunnels burst, flooding the tunnel with millions of gallons within hours. It only cooled a little. Three weeks later, an explosion <a href="https://mde.maryland.gov/programs/pressroom/Pages/436.aspx" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">linked</a> to the combustible chemical <a href="https://www.bullsheet.com/bullsheet.com/tunnelfire.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">blew out</a> manhole covers located as far as two miles away.&nbsp;</p>



<p>WorldCom, then the second largest long-distance phone company in the U.S., had fiber-optic cables in the tunnel carrying high volumes of phone and internet traffic. However, according to&nbsp; Clark, WorldCom’s resilience planning meant traffic was spread over different fiber networks in anticipation of just this kind of event.</p>



<p>On paper, Worldcom had network redundancy. But almost immediately, U.S. internet traffic <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/20/us/fire-in-baltimore-snarls-internet-traffic-too.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">slowed</a>, and WorldCom’s East Coast and transatlantic phone lines went down. The region’s narrow physical topography had concentrated all those different fiber networks into a single chokepoint, the Howard Street Tunnel. WorldCom’s resilience was, quite literally, incinerated. It had technological redundancy, but not diversity. Sometimes we don’t notice concentration until it’s too late.
          </p>
        



<p>Clark tells the story of the Howard Street Tunnel fire to show that bottlenecks aren’t always obvious, especially at the operational level, and huge systems that seem secure due to their size and resources, can unexpectedly crumble.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In today’s internet, much traffic <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-amazon-meta-and-microsoft-weave-a-fiber-optic-web-of-power-11642222824" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">passes</a> through tech firms’ private networks, for example, Google and Meta’s own undersea cables. Much internet traffic is served from a few dominant content distribution networks, like Cloudflare and Akamai, who run their own networks of proxy servers and data centers. Similarly, that traffic goes through an increasingly small number of domain name system (DNS) resolvers, which work like phone books for the internet, linking website names to their numeric address.</p>



<p>All of this improves network speed and efficiency but creates new and non-obvious bottlenecks like the Howard Street Tunnel. Centralized service providers say they’re better resourced and skilled at attacks and failures, but they are also large, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23738871.2020.1728355" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">attractive targets</a> for attackers and possible single points of system failure.</p>



<p>On Oct. 21, 2016, dozens of major U.S. websites suddenly stopped working. Domain names belonging to Airbnb, Amazon, PayPal, CNN, The New York Times simply didn’t resolve. All were clients of the commercial DNS service provider, Dyn, which had been hit by a cyberattack. Hackers infected <a href="https://coverlink.com/case-study/mirai-ddos-attack-on-dyn/#:~:text=Impacted%20internet%20platforms%20included%20PayPal,platforms%20in%20approximately%20two%20hours" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">tens of thousands</a> of internet-enabled devices with malicious software, creating a network of hijacked devices, or a botnet, that they used to bombard Dyn with queries until it collapsed. America’s biggest internet brands were brought down, essentially, by a network of<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-day-of-the-zombie-baby-monitors-when-hackers-weaponized-the-internet-of-things/2016/10/25/167fdf42-9a1b-11e6-b3c9-f662adaa0048_story.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"> baby monitors</a>. Although they all likely had resilience planning and redundancies, they went down because a single chokepoint — in one crucial layer of infrastructure — failed.</p>



<p>Consolidation drives fragility. It imposes narrowness. Arranging deliberately varied networks and services into centralized stovepipes means we repeatedly fail to think of the internet as a complex system. Just like the train crash that caused a chemical leak that resulted in burst water pipes, melted fiber-optic cables and blown up manholes, single points of failure in complex critical systems have wide, unpredictable and devastating effects.</p>

<p>Widespread outages due to centralized chokepoints have become so common that investors even use them to identify opportunities. When a failure by cloud provider Fastly took high-profile websites offline in 2021, its share price <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4c68df91-98d1-4942-87cf-f734ea2cdd73" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">surged</a>. Investors were delighted by headlines that informed them of an obscure technical service provider with an apparent lock on an essential service.<sup> </sup>To investors, this critical infrastructure failure doesn’t look like fragility but like a chance to profit.</p>



<p>The result of infrastructural narrowness is baked-in fragility that we only notice after a breakdown. But monoculture is also highly visible in our search and browser tools. Search, browsing and social media are how we find and share knowledge, and how we communicate. They’re a critical, global epistemic and democratic infrastructure, controlled by just a few U.S. companies. Crashes, fires and floods may simply be entropy in action, but systemically concentrated and risky infrastructures are choices made manifest —&nbsp;and we can make better ones.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-the-look-feel-of-a-rewilded-internet"><strong>The Look &amp; Feel Of A Rewilded Internet</strong></h2>



<p>A rewilded internet will have many more service choices. Some services like search and social media will be broken up, <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/02/what-att-breakup-teaches-us-about-big-tech-breakup" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">as AT&amp;T eventually was</a>. Instead of tech firms extracting and selling people’s personal data, different payment models will fund the infrastructure we need. Right now, there is little explicit provision for public goods like protocols and browsers, essential to making the internet work. The biggest tech firms subsidize and profoundly influence them.</p>



<p>Part of rewilding means taking what’s been pulled inside the big tech stack out of it, and paying for the true costs of connectivity. Some things like basic connectivity we will continue to pay for directly, and others like browsers we will support indirectly but transparently, as described below. The rewilded internet will have an abundance of ways to connect and relate to each other. There won’t be just one or two numbers to call if leaders of a political coup decide to shut the internet down in the middle of the night, as has happened in places like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/29/technology/internet/29cutoff.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Egypt</a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/graphics/MYANMAR-POLITICS/INTERNET-RESTRICTION/rlgpdbreepo/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Myanmar</a>. No one entity will permanently be on top. A rewilded internet will be a more interesting, usable, stable and enjoyable place to be.</p>



<p>Through extensive research, Nobel-winning economist Elinor Ostrom <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959378010000634" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">found</a> that “when individuals are well informed about the problem they face and about who else is involved, and can build settings where trust and reciprocity can emerge, grow, and be sustained over time, costly and positive actions are frequently taken without waiting for an external authority to impose rules, monitor compliance, and assess penalties.” Ostrom <a href="https://www.yesmagazine.org/economy/2021/08/11/the-commons-lobster-maine-elinor-ostrom" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">found</a> people spontaneously organizing to manage natural resources —&nbsp;from water company cooperation in California to Maine lobster fishermen monitoring each other and repelling outsiders to prevent over-fishing.</p>



<p>Self-organization also exists as part of a key internet function: traffic coordination. Internet exchange points (<a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/issues/ixps/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">IXPs</a>) are an example of common-pool resource management, where internet service providers (ISPs) collectively agree to carry each other’s data for low or no cost. Network operators of all kinds — telecoms companies, large tech firms, universities, governments and broadcasters — all need to send large amounts of data through other ISPs’ networks so that it gets to its destination.</p>



<p>If they managed this separately through individual contracts, they’d spend much more time and money. Instead, they often form IXPs, typically as independent, not-for-profit associations. As well as managing traffic, IXPs have, in many — and especially developing — countries, formed the backbone of a flourishing technical community that further drives economic development.</p>



<p>Both between people and on the internet, connections are generative. From technical standards to common-pool resource management and even to more localized broadband networks known as “altnets,” internet rewilding already has a deep toolbox of collective action ready to be deployed.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-road-to-rewilding"><strong>The Road To Rewilding</strong></h2>



<p>The list of infrastructures to be diversified is long; as well as pipes and protocols, there are operating systems, browsers, search engines, DNS, social media, advertising, cloud providers, app stores, AI companies and more. Not only are the technologies involved complex, but they’re also intertwined. But freedoms are additive. Showing what can be done in one area creates opportunities in others. First, let’s start with regulation.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-new-drive-for-antitrust-competition"><strong>The New Drive For Antitrust &amp; Competition</strong></h2>



<p>You don’t always need a big new idea like rewilding to frame and motivate major structural change. Sometimes reviving an old idea will do. President Biden’s 2021 “<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/07/09/executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Executive Order</a> on Promoting Competition in the American Economy” revived the original, pro-worker, trust-busting scope and urgency of the early 20th-century legal activist and Supreme Court Justice Louis D. Brandeis, along with rules and framings that date back to before the 1930s New Deal.</p>

<p>U.S. antitrust law was <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2023/11/how-gilded-age-lawmakers-saved-america-from-plutocracy/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">created</a> to break the power of oligarchs in oil, steel and railroads who threatened America’s young democracy. It gave workers basic protections and saw equal economic opportunity as essential to freedom. This expansive and interdependent view of competition and antitrust as essential for fairness and democracy was <a href="https://bfi.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/BFI_WP_2022-104.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">whittled away</a> by Chicago School economists’ policies in the 1970s and Regan-era judges’ court rulings over the decades and <a href="https://lawreview.uchicago.edu/print-archive/chicago-school-and-forgotten-political-dimension-antitrust-law" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">sidelined</a> by the narrow economic doctrine that intervention is only permitted when monopoly power causes consumer prices to rise. The intellectual monoculture of the consumer harm threshold has since spread globally.</p>



<p>It’s why governments just stood aside as 21st-century tech firms romped to oligopoly. If a regulator’s sole criterion for action is to make sure consumers don’t pay a penny more, then the free or data-subsidized services of tech platforms don’t even register. (Of course, consumers pay in other ways, as these tech giants exploit their personal information for profit.) This laissez-faire approach allowed the biggest firms to choke off competition by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-27/big-tech-goes-on-shopping-spree-brushing-off-antitrust-scrutiny" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">acquiring</a> their competitors and vertically integrating service providers, creating the problems we have today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regulators and enforcers in Washington and Brussels now say they have learned that lesson and won’t allow AI dominance to happen as internet concentration did. Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan and U.S. Department of Justice antitrust <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/22/technology/jonathan-kanter-apple-antitrust.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">enforcer</a>, Jonathan Kanter, are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/28/23660101/ai-competition-ftc-doj-lina-khan-jonathan-kanter-antitrust-summit" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">identifying</a> chokepoints in the AI “<a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/assistant-attorney-general-jonathan-kanter-delivers-remarks-22nd-international" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">stack</a>” —&nbsp;concentration in control of processing chips, datasets, computing capacity, algorithm innovation, distribution platforms and user interfaces —&nbsp;and analyzing each potential bottleneck to see if it affects systemic competition. This is potentially good news for people who want to prevent the current dominance of tech giants being grandfathered into our AI future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In his 2021 signing of the executive order on competition, President Biden <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/07/09/remarks-by-president-biden-at-signing-of-an-executive-order-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">said</a>, “capitalism without competition isn’t capitalism; it’s exploitation.” Biden’s enforcers are changing the kinds of cases they take up and widening the applicable legal theories on harm that they bring to judges. Instead of the traditionally narrow focus on consumer prices, today’s cases argue that the economic harms perpetrated by dominant firms include those suffered by their workers, small companies and the market as a whole.</p>



<p>Khan and Kanter have jettisoned narrow and abstruse models of market behavior for real-world experiences of healthcare workers, farmers, writers. They <em>get</em> that shutting off economic opportunity fuels far-right extremism. They’ve made antitrust enforcement and competition policy explicitly about coercion versus choice, power versus democracy. Kanter <a href="https://bruxconference2024.clevercast.com/webcast/w-qodbzp/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">told</a> a recent conference in Brussels that “excessive concentration of power is a threat … it’s not just about prices or output but it’s about freedom, liberty and opportunity.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Enforcers in Washington and Brussels are starting to preemptively block tech firms from using dominance in one realm to take over another. After scrutiny by the U.S. FTC and European Commission, Amazon recently <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68131819" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">abandoned</a> its plan to acquire the home appliance manufacturer, iRobot. Regulators on both sides of the Atlantic have also moved to stop Apple from using its iPhone platform dominance to squeeze app store competition and dominate future markets through, for example, pushing the usage of CarPlay on automakers and limiting access to its tap-to-pay digital wallet in the financial services sector.</p>



<p>Still, so far, their <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/04/technology/europe-apple-meta-google-microsoft.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">enforcement actions</a> have focused on the consumer-facing, highly visible parts of the tech giants’ exploitative and proprietary internet. The few, narrow measures of the 2021 executive order that aim to reduce infrastructure-based monopolies, only prevent <em>future </em>abuses like radio spectrum-hogging, not those already <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/mbjpjb/a-short-history-of-wireless-spectrum-the-most-complicated-puzzle-youve-ever-seen" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">locked in</a>. Sure, the best way to deal with monopolies is to stop them from happening in the first place. But unless regulators and enforcers eradicate the existing dominance of these giants now, we’ll be living in today’s infrastructure monopoly for decades, perhaps even a century.</p>



<p>Just imagine applying Khan and Kanter’s chokepoint identification and whole-system harms investigation to the internet’s <em>invisible</em> layers —&nbsp;and doing so today. Just imagine what the future possibilities for internet innovation could be if “capitalism without competition” was rooted out all the way up and down the stack.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The recent return to more muscular competition enforcement still isn’t radical enough. So far, even activist regulators have shied away from applying the toughest remedies for concentration in long-consolidated markets, such as non-discrimination requirements, functional interoperability and structural separations, i.e. breaking companies up. And talk of declaring the so-called “<a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/big-tech-s-natural-monopoly-tough-to-self-regulate-malone-says-1.1679411" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">natural monopolies</a>” in search and social media to be <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/no-facebook-google-not-public-utilities/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">public utilities</a> — and forcing them to act as common carriers open to all — is still too extreme for most.</p>



<p>But taken together, these are some of the most powerful tools we have to rewild the internet’s silent and existing vertical integrations; its deliberately moated fiefdoms squatting on bottlenecks of critical national and global infrastructure. Rewilding an already built environment isn’t just sitting back and seeing what tender, living thing can force its way through the concrete. It’s razing to the ground the structures that block out light for everyone not rich enough to live on the top floor.</p>

      “Regulators’ efforts to make the visible internet competitive will achieve little unless they also tackle the devastation that lies beneath.”    </p>

    
    
  </div>




<p>When the writer and activist Cory Doctorow <a href="https://www.noemamag.com/freeing-ourselves-from-the-clutches-of-big-tech/" data-wpel-link="internal">wrote</a> about how to free ourselves from the clutches of Big Tech, he said that though breaking up big companies will likely take decades, providing strong and mandatory interoperability would open up innovative space and slow the flow of money to the largest firms — money they would otherwise use to deepen their moats. </p>



<p>Doctorow describes “comcom,” or competitive compatibility, as a kind of “guerrilla interoperability, achieved through reverse engineering, bots, scraping and other permissionless tactics.” Before a thicket of invasive laws sprung up to strangle it, comcom was just how people figured out how to fix cars and tractors or re-write software. Comcom drives the try-every-tactic-until-one-works behavior you see in a flourishing ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an ecosystem, diversity of species is another way of saying “diversity of tactics,” as each successful new tactic creates a new niche to occupy. Whether it’s an octopus camouflaging itself as a sea snake, a cuckoo smuggling her chicks into another bird’s nest, orchids producing flowers that look just like a female bee, or parasites influencing rodent hosts to take life-ending risks, each evolutionary micro-niche is created by a successful tactic. Comcom is simply tactical diversity; it’s how organisms interact in complex, dynamic systems. And humans have demonstrated the epitome of short-term thinking by enabling the oligarchs who are trying to end it.</p>



<p>Efforts are underway. The EU already has several years of experience with interoperability mandates and precious insight into how determined firms work to circumvent such laws. The U.S., however, is still in its early days of ensuring software interoperability, for example, for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/8/24119268/wyden-secure-interoperable-goverment-collaboration-technology-act-encryption" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">videoconferencing</a>.”</p>



<p>Perhaps one way to motivate and encourage regulators and enforcers everywhere is to explain that the subterranean architecture of the internet has become a shadowland where evolution has all but stopped. Regulators’ efforts to make the visible internet competitive will achieve little unless they also tackle the devastation that lies beneath.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-next-steps"><strong>Next Steps</strong></h2>



<p>Much of what we need is already here. Beyond regulators digging deep for courage, vision and bold new litigation strategies, we need vigorous, pro-competitive government policies around procurement, investments and physical infrastructure, that require interoperability at every level and the resources to make it happen. Universities must reject research <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/06/academic-research-meta-google-university-influence/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">funding from tech firms</a> because it always comes with conditions, both spoken <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2023/12/04/tech/facebook-disinformation-whistleblower/index.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">and</a> <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/2019/06/how-big-tech-funds-debate-ai-ethics" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">unspoken</a>.</p>



<p>Instead, we need more public-funded tech research with publicly released findings aimed at serving the collective good. Such research should investigate power concentration in the internet ecosystem and practical alternatives to it. We need to recognize that much of the internet’s infrastructure is a de facto utility, that any monopolies are critical public resources that we must regain control of.</p>



<p>We must ensure regulatory and financial incentives and support for alternatives including common-pool resource management, community networks, and the myriad other collaborative mechanisms people have always used to provide essential public goods like clean water, roads and defense.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All this takes money. Governments are starved of tax revenue by the once-in-history windfalls seized by today’s tech giants, so it’s clear where the money is. We need to get it back. We need to stop talking about ethics and hoping the next generation will do a better job and start making demands of <em>power</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We know all this, but still find it so hard to collectively act. Why?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Herded into rigid tech plantations rather than functioning, diverse ecosystems, it’s tough to imagine alternatives. Even those who can see clearly may feel helpless and alone. Rewilding unites everything we know we need to do and brings with it a whole new toolbox and vision.</p>



<p>Ecologists face the same systems of exploitation and are organizing urgently, at scale and across domains. They <a href="https://www.wbur.org/onpoint/2023/12/08/inside-the-rewilding-movement" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">see clearly</a> that the issues aren’t isolated but are instances of the same pathology of command and control, extraction and domination that political anthropologist Scott first noticed in scientific forestry. The solutions are the same in ecology and technology; aggressively use the rule of law to level out unequal capital and power, then rush in to fill the gaps with better ways of doing things.</p>



<h2 id="h-keep-the-internet-the-internet"><strong>Keep The Internet, The Internet</strong></h2>



<p>Susan Leigh Star, a sociologist and theorist of infrastructure and networks, wrote in her 1999 influential paper, “The Ethnography of Infrastructure”:</p>



<p>“Study a city and neglect its sewers and power supplies (as many have), and you miss essential aspects of distributional justice and planning power. Study an information system and neglect its standards, wires, and settings, and you miss equally essential aspects of aesthetics, justice, and change.”</p>

      “If fundamental internet protocols don’t maximize the values of interoperability, generality and openness, then they’re simply not the internet.”    </p>

    
    
  </div>




<p>The technical protocols and standards that underlie the internet’s infrastructure are ostensibly developed in open, collaborative SDOs, but are also increasingly under the control of a few companies; so what appear to be “voluntary” standards are often the business choices of the biggest firms.</p>



<p>The dominance of SDOs by big firms also shapes what does <em>not</em> get standardized — for example, search, which is effectively a global monopoly. While efforts to directly <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-nottingham-avoiding-internet-centralization-02.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">address</a> internet consolidation have been raised <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/pdf/draft-mcfadden-cnsldtn-effects-01" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">repeatedly</a> within SDOs, little progress has been made. This is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/investigation-into-googles-privacy-sandbox-browser-changes" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">damaging</a> SDOs’ credibility, especially outside the U.S. SDOs must radically change or they will lose their implicit global mandate to steward the future of the internet.</p>



<p>We need internet standards to be global, open and generative. They’re the wire models that give the internet its planetary form, the gossamer-thin but steely-strong threads holding together its interoperability against fragmentation and permanent dominance. We need them to work. As internet engineer Jari Arkko <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23738871.2020.1740753?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">put it</a> in 2020, for the health of the network and all our security, SDOs must “ensure that key aspects of the evolving internet stay open, e.g. through open, standardized interfaces and that open source continues to be an important building block.” If fundamental internet protocols don’t maximize the values of interoperability, generality and openness, then they’re simply not the internet.</p>



<h2 id="h-make-laws-standards-work-together"><strong><strong>Make Laws &amp; Standards Work Together</strong></strong></h2>



<p>In 2018, a small group of Californians <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/13/business/california-data-privacy-ballot-measure.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">maneuvered</a> the California Legislature into passing the <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa#:~:text=The%20California%20Consumer%20Privacy%20Act,how%20to%20implement%20the%20law." data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">California Consumer Privacy Act</a> (CCPA). Nested in the statute was an unassuming provision, the “right to opt out of sale or sharing” your personal information via a “user-enabled global privacy control” or GPC signal that would create an automated method for doing so. The law didn’t define how GPC might work. As a technical standard was required for browsers, businesses and providers to speak the same language, the signal’s details were delegated to a group of experts.</p>



<p>In July 2021, California’s Attorney General <a href="https://www.huntonprivacyblog.com/2021/07/15/california-attorney-general-updates-ccpa-faqs-indicating-mandatory-compliance-with-global-privacy-control/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">mandated</a> that all businesses use the newly created GPC for California-based consumers visiting their websites. The group of experts is now <a href="https://w3cping.github.io/administrivia/2023/charter.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">shepherding</a> the technical specification through global web standards development at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). For California residents, GPC automates the request to “accept” or “reject” sales of your data, such as cookie-based tracking,&nbsp; on its websites; however, it isn’t yet supported by major default browsers like Chrome and Safari. Broad adoption will take time, but it’s a small step in changing real-world outcomes by driving antimonopoly practices deep into the standards stack — and it’s already being <a href="https://usercentrics.com/knowledge-hub/what-is-global-privacy-control/#:~:text=United%20States%20and%20state%2Dlevel%20laws%20and%20GPC,-Six%20new%20data&amp;text=The%20laws%20in%20California%2C%20Connecticut,to%20respect%20Global%20Privacy%20Control." data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">adopted</a> elsewhere.</p>



<p>GPC is not the first legally mandated open standard, but it was deliberately designed from day one to bridge policymaking and standards-setting. The standard provides a mechanism and the law makes it mandatory. It’s a powerful dynamic where all play to their strengths. The idea is gaining ground. A recent United Nations Human Rights Council <a href="https://documents.un.org/doc/undoc/gen/g23/117/05/pdf/g2311705.pdf?token=2yMgO0WoPF6QcYggQX&amp;fe=true" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">report</a> recommends that states delegate “regulatory functions to standard-setting organizations.” Our technical standards can be crossbred with institutions to produce protocols for governance that let people shape their online world.</p>



<h2 id="h-make-service-providers-not-users-transparent"><strong>Make Service-Providers — Not Users — Transparent</strong></h2>



<p>Today’s internet offers minimal transparency of key internet infrastructure providers. For example, browsers are highly complex pieces of infrastructure that determine how billions of people use the web, yet they are provided for free. That’s because the most commonly used search engines enter into opaque financial deals with browsers, paying them to be set as the default. Since few people change their default search engine, browsers like Safari and Firefox <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johanmoreno/2021/08/27/google-estimated-to-be-paying-15-billion-to-remain-default-search-engine-on-safari/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">make money</a> by defaulting the search bar to Google, locking in its dominance even as the search engine’s quality of output <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/09/google-search-size-usefulness-decline/675409/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">declines</a>.</p>



<p>This creates a quandary. If antitrust enforcers were to impose competition, browsers would lose their main source of income. Infrastructure requires money, but the planetary nature of the internet challenges our public funding model, leaving the door open to private capture. However, if we see the current opaque system as what it is, a kind of non-state taxation, then we can craft an alternative.</p>



<p>Search engines are a logical place for governments to mandate the collection of a levy that supports browsers and other key internet infrastructure, which could be financed transparently, under open, transnational, multistakeholder oversight. &nbsp;Imagining new institutional methods to solve old problems at a global scale is one way to rewild the web.</p>

<h2 id="h-make-space-to-grow"><strong>Make Space To Grow</strong></h2>



<p>We need to stop thinking of internet infrastructure as too hard to fix. It’s the underlying system we use for nearly everything we do. The former prime minister of Sweden, Carl Bildt, and former Canadian deputy foreign minister, Gordon Smith <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23738871.2016.1235908" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> in 2016 that the internet was becoming “the infrastructure of all infrastructure.”<sup> </sup>It’s how we organize, connect and build knowledge, even — perhaps — planetary intelligence. Right now, it’s concentrated, fragile and utterly toxic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ecologists have re-oriented their field as a “<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1600-0498.12149" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">crisis discipline</a>,” a field of study that’s not just about learning things but about saving them. We technologists need to do the same. Rewilding the internet connects and grows what people are doing across regulation, standards-setting and new ways of organizing and building infrastructure, to tell a shared story of where we want to go. It’s a shared vision with many strategies. The instruments we need to shift away from extractive technological monocultures are at hand or ready to be built.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just as a diverse “<a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/09/tiny-urban-forests-miyawaki-biodiversity-carbon-capture/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">pocket forest</a>” is the <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354231796_Between_Pocket_Forest_Wilderness_and_Restored_Rural_Arcadia_Optimizing_the_Use_of_a_Feral_Woodland_Enclave_in_Urban_Environment" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">surest</a> way to regenerate urban vegetation, a global network with multiple different ways “to internet” is the best insurance policy for future innovation and resilience. We need to rewild the internet for the future, for our freedom to build tools and spaces, and to share knowledge, ideas and stories that haven’t been anticipated by the internet’s current overlords and cannot be contained.</p>

While I was working on Viberary, I remarked to friends that Redis was a better vector store for probably 80% of use-cases than actual vector databases, and that it was a shame that the Redis Search module wasn’t well-known. Of course, in the heat of the generative AI landscape, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monkey%27s_Paw">the monkey’s paw curled</a>, the over-leveraged business decided they needed to <a href="https://redis.io/press/redis-labs-secures-44-million-funding-led-goldman-sachs-private-capital-investing-strengthen-database-leadership/">actually make money</a>, and they <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/04/redis-license-change-and-forking-are-a-mess-that-everybody-can-feel-bad-about/">changed the license</a>, ostensibly so that AWS and other large-scale cloud vendors couldn’t sell it as a product offering.</p><p>In a pattern that has previously happened for Elasticsearch and Terraform, and one that was extremely predictable, <a href="https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/966631/6bf2063136effa1e/">Redis is now forked at least three different ways</a> - the original Redis, now <a href="https://redis.io/blog/redis-adopts-dual-source-available-licensing/">no longer under BSD</a>, <a href="https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey">Valkey</a>, under BSD and led by previous contributors to Redis from AWS and other companies, and <a href="https://redict.io/">Redict</a>, under GPL, led by an open-source coalition. Both of these licenses allow commercial reuse.</p><p>The old Redis was for developers. The new Redis is for enterprise sales, and for <a href="https://redis.io/blog/the-future-of-redis/">generative AI</a>. It’s true that it’s not yet entirely clear what all of this means for the future of Redis the software. Some say the<a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3714688/the-bizarre-defense-of-trillion-dollar-cabals.html"> licensing changes won’t impact much</a> if you’re not a large-scale Redis reseller. Because it’s true that the license changes were all legal and all parties acted in accordance with both what’s acceptable and what the market dictates to sustain the software. And yet at the same time, projects that depend on <a href="https://github.com/alpinelinux/aports/commit/57959e206db177fb4c2c641dac24eb0bf1d528ae#diff-cbaca272b75bdb3596a5e2ddab75cf99bb95f420da9f2dbede1fff6148fe986fR5">Redis are withholding updates</a> or <a href="https://github.com/packit/deployment/issues/561">migrating.</a></p><p>But the problem is not only that the license changed suddenly, without warning, it’s the messaging behind the change, and the message is, even though there is extremely active community development, Redis is no longer in and of the community. We are <a href="https://www.ftrain.com/wwic">no longer being consulted.</a></p><p>As for the forks, there is no clear direction yet either. Valkey is on GitHub and already extremely active, yet there is already a debate about what <a href="https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey/issues/18#issuecomment-2016683243">OSS means in the context of the fork</a>. Redict is entirely open but has opened contributions on Codeberg, where they are far from GitHub’s AI training data collection, but also miss out on the network effect for contribution in the GitHub social network, the friction of which can’t be underestimated.</p><p>All of this is very sad, because it’s not clear which path forward makes sense in this new landscape for me as a builder if I want to now use Redis in a new project, particularly since neither of the new projects support modules like <a href="https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/interact/search-and-query/">Redis Search yet</a>. (Or if they do, it’s not clear to me whether it’s directly drop-in compatible and what the licensing issues are there.) It seems like the new, corporate Redis is no longer for me or my personal projects, which is ironic given that my interests lie squarely in the vector search and generative AI spaces. It’s also not clear if I wanted to contribute, which one I should give my time and energy into. So, it seems like I’ll be staying on the Redis available <a href="https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/13157">before this commit</a> for <a href="https://github.com/alpinelinux/aports/commit/57959e206db177fb4c2c641dac24eb0bf1d528ae#diff-cbaca272b75bdb3596a5e2ddab75cf99bb95f420da9f2dbede1fff6148fe986fR5">the time being</a>, until the dust settles.</p><p><a href="https://vickiboykis.com/essays/2017-05-10-good-things-dont-scale/">Good things don’t scale</a>, except in the case of Redis, where all it does scale in <code>O(1)</code> time, but doesn’t align with the realities of markets in software.</p><p>Fortunately, in redis/valkey/redict codebases, one thing that is still a constant is that whenever there is a ping, you can always expect a quiet, resounding pong, and in that regard, with the current energy around open-source, particularly in the ML space, I’m optimistic.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p><span>If you're an organ donor in the U.S., there's a 25% chance your kidney ends up in the trash. Today's guests, </span><strong>Jennifer Erickson </strong><span>and </span><strong>Greg Segal</strong><span>, argue a government-enabled monopoly is the culprit.</span></p><p><span>We spoke with Erickson and Segal about how they successfully advocated for major fixes to the organ donation network. Erickson is a Senior Fellow with the </span><strong><a href="https://fas.org/expert/jennifer-erickson/" rel="">Federation of American Scientists</a></strong><a href="https://fas.org/expert/jennifer-erickson/" rel=""> </a><span>and former Assistant Director of Innovation for Growth in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Segal is the founder and CEO of </span><strong><a href="https://www.organize.org/about" rel="">Organize</a></strong><span>, a nonprofit patient advocacy group.&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li><p><em>Why are 28,000 organs going untransplanted annually?</em></p></li><li><p><em>Why does 1% of the federal budget go to dialysis?</em></p></li><li><p><em>Why has a sole bidder run the U.S. transplant system for decades?</em></p></li></ul><p><em>[Thanks to Rita Sokolova for her judicious transcript edits.]</em></p><p><strong>Jennifer Erickson: </strong><span>What I will say out of the gate about the organ waiting list is that it alternatingly makes me want to turn over the table, it makes me so angry because it's unnecessary. But then also the great thing is, this is actually a healthcare problem that we can fix. The problem, it turns out, is actually the federal contractors.&nbsp;</span></p><p>So who are the contractors? First, there are 55 local contractors. These are called organ procurement organizations or OPOs. Some have a state as their donation service area, some are across part of a state.&nbsp;</p><p>Congress set up a monopoly contract in the eighties, called the Organ Procurement Transplantation Network, or OPTN. This national contract has only ever been held by one contractor, the United Network for Organ Sharing. If you've seen Grey's Anatomy or ER and they said “I need a heart, get UNOS on the phone,” that's UNOS.&nbsp;</p><p>Just one example again of how bad it is: Greg and I recently got a whistleblower call in the last heat wave. Someone took a liver, a human liver that a family said yes to on the worst day of their life because a loved one died in an accident, and left it at the wrong hospital’s cargo bay in 90 degree heat, and no one noticed for an hour and a half.&nbsp;</p><p>The OPTN has a board to set policy. Who's on the board right now? The current board, the board members of the nation's Organ Procurement Transplantation Network, were until recently the exact same board members for the contractor, UNOS. So, literally, they would meet on a Sunday as OPTN board members and then on a Monday as UNOS board members.</p><p>To say it's a conflict is an understatement: it's a Venn diagram that just is one circle. It's really, really bad. So as a first thing, this legacy board is still deciding policy for the nation. There are ongoing, bipartisan Congressional investigations into conflicts of interest and corruption.</p><p>The tech is so bad. The United States Digital Service found 17 days of downtime in recent years. Until recently, the algorithm that was protecting all organ donor patient information in the country, so STI status, mental health, every physical history, was from 1996.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a fixable problem: it’s about the contractor, supply chain, it’s logistics, transparency. Congress unanimously passed a bill in July. The only other thing that passed unanimously that day was Tony Bennett Day.</p><p>Senator Todd Young, a Republican from Indiana, who lost a friend waiting for a heart, has done a lot of oversight into OPOs, including the OPO in Indiana. And in one year of that oversight — this has been peer reviewed and published — organ donation in the state of Indiana went up by 44 percent. It went up by 44 percent because they approached 57 percent more families. What in the hell was that government contractor doing before Todd Young started asking questions?</p><p><strong>JE:</strong><span> The predecessor organization to UNOS lobbied heavily to insert language into the National Organ Transplant Act (</span><strong><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/98th-congress/senate-bill/2048" rel="">NOTA</a></strong><span>) that stipulated that, to compete for this contract, a contractor has to be an independent nonprofit with expertise in organ donation and transplantation. </span><em>That phrase has always been interpreted to mean UNOS.</em><span> In 2018, the last time there was an open contracting cycle, you had to have </span><strong><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/for-the-first-time-in-years-new-groups-may-vie-to-run-organ-transplant-network/2018/04/23/a8b7eb3c-44ad-11e8-ad8f-27a8c409298b_story.html" rel="">three years of experience</a></strong><span> to even submit a bid to the federal government. Now, that might sound sensible until you realize that there’s a national monopoly and only one group has ever had three years of experience. So no one else applied.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The United States Digital Service produced a report called </span><em><strong><a href="https://thewellnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/143-USDS-Report-Modernizing-OPTN-Jan-2021_Redacted70.pdf" rel="">Lives are at Stake</a></strong></em><span>, which is not a normal name for a government report. It's a way of writing it in flashing red letters. They identified that phrase in NOTA as one that has restricted competition across decades, and in the summer of 2023, both the Senate and the House unanimously passed the </span><strong><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/2544" rel="">Securing the U.S. Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network Act</a></strong><span>, which removed it. President Biden signed that into law in September.&nbsp;</span></p><p>It was surprising even to Greg and me how this news broke through in the national media, but I think it was because Americans inherently know that monopolies are bad and no one, unless you're in this very particular world of organ donation, was aware that there was a national organ monopoly and that they were funding as taxpayers, and which has spectacularly failed patients.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>JE:</strong><span> I think one really important thing to know is that these organ donation contractors are funded by the taxpayer. Organ procurement is </span><strong><a href="https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Transmittals/downloads/R471pr1.pdf" rel="">cost reimbursed</a></strong><span>, which means that pretty much anything organ procurement organizations pay for gets reimbursed by readers, by taxpayers.&nbsp;</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://costlyeffects.organdonationreform.org/Summary/" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39f177aa-719c-478d-a007-93f2ea1bf73a_2550x1650.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39f177aa-719c-478d-a007-93f2ea1bf73a_2550x1650.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39f177aa-719c-478d-a007-93f2ea1bf73a_2550x1650.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39f177aa-719c-478d-a007-93f2ea1bf73a_2550x1650.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39f177aa-719c-478d-a007-93f2ea1bf73a_2550x1650.jpeg" width="1456" height="942" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/39f177aa-719c-478d-a007-93f2ea1bf73a_2550x1650.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:942,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Detailed map of governance and oversight in the organ donation process&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;https://costlyeffects.organdonationreform.org/Summary/&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="Detailed map of governance and oversight in the organ donation process" title="Detailed map of governance and oversight in the organ donation process" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39f177aa-719c-478d-a007-93f2ea1bf73a_2550x1650.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39f177aa-719c-478d-a007-93f2ea1bf73a_2550x1650.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39f177aa-719c-478d-a007-93f2ea1bf73a_2550x1650.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39f177aa-719c-478d-a007-93f2ea1bf73a_2550x1650.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>From Organ Donation Reform</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>That’s how you end up with organ contractor executives </span><strong><a href="https://oversightdemocrats.house.gov/news/press-releases/oversight-subcommittee-expands-investigation-into-fraud-waste-and-abuse-in-organ" rel="">flying around on private jets</a></strong><span> and going to Sonoma wine retreats while the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) say they're </span><strong><a href="https://www.opodata.org/" rel="">failing</a></strong><span> basic government performance metrics. If you're really worried about which vineyard you take your board to, you're probably not spending a ton of time thinking about how to staff underserved hospitals in the middle of the night.</span><em>&nbsp;</em></p><p><span>I think the system has stayed broken for so long because they had budgets to market themselves. There’s a halo effect here: 95% of Americans </span><strong><a href="https://www.donornetworkwest.org/about-donation/organ-donation-facts-statistics/" rel="">support organ donation</a></strong><span>. That literally polls higher than puppies and ice cream.

And despite wild executive perks and abuse of funds, these contractors are nominally nonprofits.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>So no one was ever looking under the hood.

That put it into technicolor for us that we had not only a preventable, outrageous tragedy and a responsibility to actually fix it and prevent it. Greg and the researchers that he worked with showed that there are 17,500 kidneys, 7,500 livers, 1,500 hearts, and 1,500 lungs that go untransplanted every year from potential American organ donors. For scale, that means the United States does not need to have a waiting list for livers, hearts, or lungs within three years, and the kidney waiting list should come way down. That data convinced not only the Obama administration, but also the Trump administration. This reform movement has now crossed three administrations, and that almost never happens.</span></p><p><strong>Greg Segal:</strong><span> So our organization, </span><strong><a href="https://www.organize.org/about" rel="">Organize</a></strong><span>, was awarded the Innovator in Residence position in the secretary's office of the </span><strong><a href="https://www.hhs.gov/" rel="">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</a></strong><span> (HHS) from 2015 to 2016. We were still technically a non-governmental nonprofit, but in some sense, we were embedded within HHS.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>We had different levels of data access and we used </span><strong><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd/icd9cm.htm" rel="">ICD-9 codes</a></strong><span>, which have since been revised to </span><strong><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd/icd10.htm#:~:text=The%20International%20Classification%20of%20Diseases,and%20presentation%20of%20mortality%20statistics." rel="">ICD-10</a></strong><span>, to paint an objective picture of how well, or in many cases, how poorly, these industry stakeholders were performing. Many people probably directionally knew that something was amiss in this system, but it was very opaque. Before having this data, it was hard to articulate what was going on to members of Congress, and you sometimes felt like you were Christopher Lloyd from </span><em>Back to the Future</em><span>, where you're just the forensic accountant or crazy person in the office.</span></p><p><strong>GS:</strong><span> We could access it as private citizens, but HHS employees really helped us understand why things were set up the way that they were, how things were coded, and which one of our ten ideas might actually be implementable. As Jennifer always says, government works by analogy. We had so many different ideas, and then civil servants would very soberly explain to us why nine of them were just completely unfeasible. When you're left with the one idea, that does not guarantee that it will happen. We then needed help understanding the ten different analogous projects that have happened in the last ten years to figure out how to implement ours.</span></p><p><span>So we used government data, and we validated it with some </span><strong><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28726327/" rel="">external data</a></strong><span> voluntarily shared from industry to verify that what we were doing was directionally correct with what was happening in industry.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>JE:</strong><span> One of the things that really helped was the specificity. There had previously been </span><strong><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26813036/" rel="">federally funded research</a></strong><span> showing that in the United States as few as one in five organ donors were having their organs recovered. So four in five were not, right?&nbsp;</span></p><p>We knew that there was a gap between the huge support for organ donation and what was actually happening. What I’ve learned is that if there’s a big national problem, the government often does exactly the wrong thing. It punts, it does another big study, a consensus conference.&nbsp;</p><p><span>What you really need to understand is the data: what is happening in the state of Virginia, what's happening across Texas or California. There are 55 of these organ procurement organizations, and we found a </span><strong><a href="https://costlyeffects.organdonationreform.org/Summary/" rel="">470%</a></strong><span> variability in recovery between the top performers and the lowest performers. You need to ask, “What are the top performers doing that the bottom performers are not?” That really helps you get specific and follow the data to find problems you can solve.</span></p><p><strong>JE:</strong><span> So keep in mind, there's a huge generosity of spirit and national agreement about organ donation. Most people, myself included before I started this work, think of organ donation as, “Did you tick a box at the DMV when you got a driver's license?” And that really isn't the story of what happens.&nbsp;</span></p><p>In the United States, only 2-3% percent of deaths are organ donation-eligible. That includes car and motorcycle accidents, overdoses, strokes, and traumas: something that means a patient isn't going to make it, but up to eight of their organs might. When someone is dying in an organ donation-eligible way, that hospital calls the organ procurement organization they're assigned to. That OPO is supposed to turn up to every potential case in a timely and compassionate way and have one of two conversations with the family:&nbsp;</p><p>“Smith family, I'm so sorry for your loss. Jane was a registered organ donor. We'd like to proceed with her wishes.”&nbsp;</p><p>Or, “Smith family, I’m so sorry for your loss. Jane seemed like a wonderful person. Can we talk to you about organ donation?”&nbsp;</p><p>Keep in mind that 95% of Americans support organ donation. My older brother is a registered organ donor, and if, God forbid, something happened to him, and someone approached me at the hospital in a timely and compassionate way, I would consent to organ donation. If they do not approach me, then I cannot consent. If they do not show up at the hospital, even if he ticked the box at the DMV, those organs cannot be recovered.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Another problem is that when they do show up, OPOs are not required to have </span><strong><a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Diane%20Brockmeier%20Written%20Testimony-Senate%20Finance%20Committee.pdf" rel="">basic standards of clinical care</a></strong><span>. So another way in which organs are lost is </span><strong><a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/UNOS%20Hearing%20Confidential%20Memo%20(FOR%20RELEASE)%20on%20website.pdf" rel="">medical mistakes</a></strong><span>.</span></p><p><span>Organs are literally lost and damaged in transit every single week. The OPTN contractor is </span><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxD0eYalmQI&amp;t=3934s" rel="">15 times</a></strong><span> more likely to </span><strong><a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/how-lifesaving-organs-for-transplant-go-missing-in-transit/" rel="">lose or damage an organ in transit</a></strong><span> than an airline is a suitcase. That should be shocking. Think about a donor family agreeing to organ donation on the worst day of their life, and what it means if their loved one's kidney gets left on the airport counter in Atlanta, or gets delayed and then thrown in the trash in another part of the country. And then, of course, what that means to one of the 100,000 Americans waiting to get that call for a lifesaving transplant.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>GS:</strong><span> I’ll also share a lesson on advocacy. There's a rare genetic condition in my family which causes heart failure. My dad and aunt had heart transplants, another aunt died waiting for her transplant. I spent a lot of time running around D.C., talking to people about the organ donation system, and had a lot of sympathetic meetings where people heard me out. I think I convinced them that I was right, and then they moved on to the next meeting and never thought about me again.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Then I realized that kidneys are not only just as important as hearts, but far more expensive to taxpayers. If you need a kidney, you are almost certainly waiting on dialysis, which is then paid for by Medicare. In 2019, </span><strong><a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/about-niddk/strategic-plans-reports/usrds/prior-data-reports/2019" rel="">treatment for kidney failure cost Medicare $36 billion</a></strong><span> — it might be higher now, and is certainly higher if you include Medicaid numbers and VA numbers.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>One percent of the </span><strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/12/11/organ-donation-reform-could-save-thousands-lives-billions-taxes-column/4377383002/" rel="">entire federal budget</a></strong><span> goes to dialysis</span><strong>.</strong><span> So we started foregrounding kidneys in our advocacy, but reform to the kidney donation system, at least the deceased donation system, is a vehicle for the same reforms for all of the organ categories. After we started talking about the importance of helping people get kidney transplants, within a year or two, there was a presidential directive on reforming the organ donation system that rode on the </span><strong><a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-advancing-american-kidney-health/" rel="">Executive Order on Advancing American Kidney Health</a></strong><span>.</span></p><p>I was so blinded by telling my story that I didn't think for a while about what's actually going to resonate most with a person across the table from me. And in D.C., often that is not just who has the most sympathetic issue, but whose issue has a pay-for to it.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>JE:</strong><span> There are two areas of healthcare that are still under cost reimbursement, which means the taxpayer funds the vast majority of the system: critical access hospitals and organ procurement. As Greg alluded to, because of some amazing patient advocacy in the 1970s, kidneys have a unique classification and end-stage renal disease is the only major disease that qualifies you for Medicare regardless of age. In 1971, a patient was </span><strong><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK234191/" rel="">dialyzed on the floor of Congress</a></strong><span>, and Congress decided they needed to help patients on dialysis and made an exception so that disease could be covered by Medicare.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>So if we can get patients a kidney transplant, not only can they live a much better quality of life, which is what Greg and I care about, we can also save the taxpayer </span><strong><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35690519/" rel="">up to $1.5 million per patient</a></strong><span> in foregone dialysis. It's really rare in healthcare that patient and taxpayer interests are so closely aligned.</span></p><p><strong>JE:</strong><span> I think there were a few things. One is, you actually have two different types of contractors. The national contractor, OPTN, was supposed to be overseen by HRSA, which is one agency of HHS. The dozens of local OPOs are supposed to be overseen by </span><strong><a href="https://www.cms.gov/" rel="">Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services</a></strong><span> (CMS). So you already had this division of oversight, and both agencies would say, “We have this government contractor — UNOS — that is supposed to be looking out over the whole system.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Here I'll quote </span><strong><a href="https://www.grassley.senate.gov/" rel="">Senator Chuck Grassley</a></strong><span>, who’s been investigating this since 2005. He said, “Asking one contractor to look out for dozens of others is like asking the fox to guard the chicken house.” It's fundamentally a failed model. It has left patients in a terrible and deadly position. The </span><em><strong><a href="https://thewellnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/143-USDS-Report-Modernizing-OPTN-Jan-2021_Redacted70.pdf" rel="">Lives are at Stake</a></strong></em><span> report details a continuous erosion of leverage from the government through the contracting cycles.&nbsp;</span></p><p>For example, the report says that UNOS threatened to walk away and operate the U.S. transplant system outside the contract, which would be incredibly bad faith behavior. Government isn't a monolith, but I think some people in government perhaps thought they didn’t have alternatives. Keep in mind that OPOs are on four-year contracting cycles, and UNOS, the OPTN, has been on five-year contracting cycles. So all these contractors have had to do is withstand scrutiny during a contracting period, and then they're in for four or five more years.</p><p><span>A </span><em>Forbes</em><span> piece in 1999 </span><strong><a href="https://www.forbes.com/forbes/1999/1101/6411164a.html?sh=69eaaed7659f" rel="">called</a></strong><span> UNOS a “cartel”, and “the federal monopoly that's chilling the supply of transplantable organs and letting Americans who need them die needlessly.” </span><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Shalala" rel="">Donna Shalala</a></strong><span>, who was the Secretary of HHS under President Bill Clinton, called out </span><strong><a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-105shrg51198/html/CHRG-105shrg51198.htm" rel="">UNOS misinformation</a></strong><span> in a Congressional hearing back in 1998 and called for competition in the field. The then-leader of HRSA </span><strong><a href="https://www.forbes.com/forbes/1999/1101/6411164a.html?sh=20cfd4b7659f" rel="">called</a></strong><span> for an end to the stranglehold of the UNOS monopoly, and yet 25 years later, UNOS is still the monopoly contractor in charge. I think people of goodwill tried to introduce reform, but UNOS still managed to keep the contract.</span></p><p><strong>JE:</strong><span> There have been some tremendous surgeons who have spoken up, and three have </span><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2748&amp;v=TnKo8Q-Hemk&amp;embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.opodata.org%2F&amp;embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.opodata.org&amp;source_ve_path=NzY3NTg&amp;feature=emb_yt_watermark" rel="">testified</a></strong><span> before three different congressional hearings in recent years, saying that too many of their patients are dying, and the system has to be fixed. There's also been investigative reporting about </span><strong><a href="https://about.bgov.com/news/biden-plan-to-fix-organ-transplant-network-promised-more-support/" rel="">UNOS threatening whistleblowers</a></strong><span>. I'm grateful for voices for reform and I just want to acknowledge that this is why the government has to act.</span></p><p><strong>JE:</strong><span> It did, but there were two problems. One, when it came to contracting, there was often a strict interpretation of that phrase in NOTA, which kept constraining competition.</span></p><p><span>I would also say that there are other oversight responsibilities that both HRSA and CMS should use and never have. The technology of UNOS is </span><strong><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/07/31/unos-transplants-kindeys-hearts-technology/" rel="">deeply failing and antiquated</a></strong><span> — for hours at a time, it will shut down and no organs across the country can be matched.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Organs are all on a clock, right? There's only so much cold ischemic time, or time outside the body, they can have. An astounding one out of every four kidneys that's recovered from a generous American organ donor is </span><strong><a href="https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/media/p2oc3ada/data_report_kidney_full_20220624_1.pdf" rel="">thrown in the trash</a></strong><span>. The federal government has never held UNOS or any OPOs accountable for that.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Until recent data-driven regulation passed, CMS could not pull a contract from a failing OPO. They tried to decertify the Arkansas OPO in 1999, but </span><strong><a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp2/104/1084/2503890/" rel="">ultimately lost in court</a></strong><span> because the regulation was </span><strong><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/despite-low-performance-organ-collection-group-gets-new-federal-contract/2019/02/04/9b9ba2aa-2895-11e9-b2fc-721718903bfc_story.html" rel="">written so badly</a></strong><span>, yet CMS didn't update it for 21 years until 2020. That update, which passed under both </span><strong><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-administration-finalizes-rule-that-could-make-thousands-more-organs-available-for-transplant/2020/11/21/912168d0-2b60-11eb-9b14-ad872157ebc9_story.html" rel="">President Trump</a></strong><span> and </span><strong><a href="https://www.pogo.org/investigations/americas-transformative-new-organ-donation-rule-goes-into-effect-over-objections-from-monopolistic-contractors" rel="">President Biden</a></strong><span>, was the first big win for patient advocates. OPOs will be held accountable for their performance this year. Between that and the Securing the U.S. OTPN Act that removed the restrictive phrase that propped up the national organ monopoly, we’re hoping that 2024 is a different year.</span></p><p><strong>GS:</strong><span> If you'll indulge me, I’ll add one other quick piece of context from 1999, not just as a history lesson, but because it is fiercely relevant now.</span></p><p><strong>GS:</strong><span> It’s one thing for HRSA to say that we need more competition back in 1999, but government contracting doesn’t let them just pick whoever they want and bet on them. HRSA can only respond to credible bids that meet contracting requirements. The </span><em>Forbes</em><span> report mentioned that UNOS was interfering with other competitors’ bids, but even if everyone knew that, HRSA’s hands would still have been tied.</span></p><p><strong>JE:</strong><span> I mentioned how Greg brought this issue to the White House when I was in the Obama administration. After the transition in January 2017, we brought it to Alex Azar, who was the Secretary of HHS. [Statecraft </span><em>interviewed Secretary Azar on “How to Replicate Operation Warp Speed.”</em><span>] Greg, Secretary Azar, and I all lost relatives to organ failure, so we were all connected in this rather unfortunate way. We said, “We want to show you everything we started, every place that we failed and where there's still work to do. This is not a political issue.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>This is a rare bipartisan issue that's crossed multiple administrations. We had similar conversations with Congress members and their staffs, and as I said, Senator Chuck Grassley has done hero’s work highlighting problems at OPOs over the years. We also worked with then-ranking member </span><strong><a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/" rel="">Ron Wyden</a></strong><span>, who is now chair of the Senate Finance Committee, </span><strong><a href="https://www.cardin.senate.gov/" rel="">Senator</a></strong><a href="https://www.cardin.senate.gov/" rel=""> </a><strong><a href="https://www.cardin.senate.gov/" rel="">Ben Cardin</a></strong><span>, and </span><strong><a href="https://www.young.senate.gov/" rel="">Senator Todd Young</a></strong><span>, who actually reached out to Greg over a cold email when Young was still a member of the House. The four of them have really been tremendous leaders in this work.</span></p><p><span>So we went to see members of the Senate Finance Committee and also talked to members of the </span><strong><a href="https://oversight.house.gov/" rel="">House Oversight Committee</a></strong><span>, which had a bipartisan hearing back in 2021. We tried to bring the data and the experts to show them what was going on. The Senate Finance investigation is now four years old, literally longer than Watergate, and has driven many reforms. And I think it's important to realize that Congress can still work. I really want to give credit to not only those four senators, but also </span><strong><a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/" rel="">Senators Elizabeth Warren</a></strong><span>, </span><strong><a href="https://www.booker.senate.gov/" rel="">Cory Booker</a></strong><span>, </span><strong><a href="https://www.moran.senate.gov/public/" rel="">Jerry Moran</a></strong><span>, </span><strong><a href="https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/" rel="">Bill Cassidy</a></strong><span>, and on the House side, </span><strong><a href="https://porter.house.gov/" rel="">Congresswoman Katie Porter</a></strong><span>, and the current leader of the House Oversight Committee, </span><strong><a href="https://comer.house.gov/" rel="">James Comer</a></strong><span>. There are a lot of unlikely bedfellows here.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>GS:</strong><span> The Senate Finance Committee investigation launched publicly in February 2020, but Senator Todd Young first contacted me in 2014, when he was still a congressman. He was elected to the Senate in 2016, and eventually in 2018, he moved over to the Senate Finance Committee, where Chuck Grassley was Chair at the time and had been investigating UNOS on and off since 2005.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>JE:</strong><span> I think out of the gate, it helps to have bipartisanship and finding points of commonality. You need to be able to convince the two political parties that this makes sense to move on and ground things in data.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>I just want to give a tremendous amount of credit to members and their staff, who really stayed focused on patients at every turn. They </span><strong><a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/ranking-members-news/grassley-wyden-subpoena-the-united-network-for-organ-sharing-as-part-of-continued-investigation-into-us-organ-transplant-system" rel="">subpoenaed UNOS</a></strong><span> when it was stonewalling the investigation, and staffers pored over patient safety documents to highlight exactly what happened and who to hold accountable. It was painstaking work.&nbsp;</span></p><p>There’s been a ton of resistance from some of the contractors themselves, but I also want to call out the good actors. There have been OPO leaders who have called for reform, who said that their jobs matter and that they and their colleagues should be held to a high standard. Some of them have testified before both the House and the Senate.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>GS:</strong><span> There have now been two Senate Finance Committee hearings. The hearings are vehicles to achieve a goal, and the Senate Finance Committee was so strategic and thoughtful about the fact that there were a hundred problems with the system. We fixed a few, but there are still ninety-something left.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The first hearing was in August of 2022, and a potential contracting cycle for OTPN was coming up. That hearing successfully showed that the status quo is unsafe and untenable, and by March of 2023, HRSA announced the intent to break up the OPTN monopoly in the </span><strong><a href="https://www.hrsa.gov/optn-modernization" rel="">OPTN Modernization Initiative</a></strong><span>. Then in the July 2023 Senate Finance Committee hearing, Senators advocated for the passage of legislation to amend NOTA to support the breakup of the monopoly contract. Seven days later, the legislation passed. So to your point about scoring points on a TikTok executive, if there isn't a clear policy goal, what's going to fill that vacuum is a partisan goal or someone's need to go viral for reelection.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>JE:</strong><span> Yeah. The Senate Finance investigation is ongoing, but it launched in </span><strong><a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/chairmans-news/finance-committee-members-probe-us-organ-transplant-system" rel="">February 2020</a></strong><span>. They issued a damning report of system failures that called for the breakup of the monopoly in August of 2022. The modernization initiative then followed about nine months later, saying that they needed help from Congress to amend the National Organ Transplant Act. That bill actually originally came out of the </span><strong><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/4343/text?s=1&amp;r=63" rel="">Energy and Commerce Committee</a></strong><span> in the House, which is the Committee of Jurisdiction. Both the House and Senate passed the bill unanimously last July.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>JE:</strong><span> And this was not only Senate Finance, but also, huge credit to Senator Cory Booker and then-Congressman Mondaire Jones, who led a </span><strong><a href="https://www.booker.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/letter_to_the_biden_admin_on_organ_donations.pdf" rel="">bicameral letter in November of 2022</a></strong><span> that underscored the importance of the committee recommendations and called to break up the national monopoly and that CMS enforce the OPO rule as an urgent health equity issue.</span></p><p><span>We're now four years on from the investigation and just last week HRSA </span><strong><a href="https://www.hrsa.gov/optn-modernization" rel="">issued the first draft competitive Requests for Proposal (RFPs)</a></strong><span> for pieces of the OPTN contract. In our minds, nothing is actually going to be done until the monopoly is broken up, and there are new, competent contractors working in transparent contracting cycles that the government is holding accountable.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The rule that lets CMS hold OPOs accountable based on objective data </span><strong><a href="https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/organ-procurement-organization-opo-conditions-coverage-final-rule-revisions-outcome-measures-opos" rel="">passed in 2020</a></strong><span>, but none of them have lost a contractor contract yet because of the sheer amount of time it takes to put those rules through and get through contracting cycles. The OPO rule went through a midnight regulatory review process in 2021, was passed again by the Biden administration, and then we had to wait for the next contracting cycle.</span></p><p><span>This year the federal government will collect data, but that data won’t be available until 2026, when failing OPOs will be replaced by higher performers. That regulation alone is projected to save </span><strong><a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/content/forefront/new-organ-donation-rule-win-black-patients-and-health-equity" rel="">7,000 lives a year</a></strong><span> and </span><strong><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-03-24/biden-should-implement-trump-s-organ-donation-policy-fix" rel="">one billion dollars annually</a></strong><span> to Medicare. So when will we think that the system is working for patients? When every part of the country is served by a high-performing OPO. That's not an abstract vision, you can look at performance metrics from the government.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>JE:</strong><span> I would go back to what Senator Chuck Grassley talked about, the fox guarding the chicken house. In the fight for the OPO rule, we saw that UNOS leaders were surrogates for the status quo on unenforceable OPO metrics and tried to block accountability. In similar fashion, the Association of OPOs lobbied against different provisions in the bill, trying to restrict competition.</span></p><p><strong>GS:</strong><span> I think that there was a lot of laundering of that opposition through other groups, whether through an astroturf lobbying group or misinforming well-meaning patients who thought they were advocating for themselves but were doing it based on completely uninformed, misleading, or objectively incorrect inputs. In the last few years, lobbyists have said “We support the goals of increasing transplant, but we have edits,” but then their edits just oppose everything.</span></p><p><strong>JE:</strong><span> There can be valid reasons to discard organs, but the United States is the only country that is throwing away one out of every four kidneys. I don't think anyone would be impressed by the “Look how many kidneys we didn't lose” argument much as they wouldn't want to hear a pilot say, “Look how many flights I didn't crash.” This is a system that has to operate at a high level every day, and we know how to do these logistics. Yet in 2024, we have a system where the technology goes down for hours at a time. The wifi at my house doesn't go down for hours at a time. And if it did, it would have no real consequence. That we have life and death systems that have such abject failures should be alarming.</span></p><p>In some instances, the system does work. Greg's dad got a heart transplant, but I do not think that it should have been a five year wait. We put patients and their families through way too much unnecessary pain, and the organ waiting list is an awful place to be. There are OPOs that do their job at a really high level, and I want every family and patient to receive that service.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>GS:</strong><span> To respond to that Kevin O'Connor quote, he is right that there are many reasons that organs are discarded. Jennifer is also right that the U.S. is an outlier. It isn’t necessarily true that one thing went wrong 100 times. It could be true that 20 things went wrong and they each went wrong five times, but the U.S. is the only country in which that happens. That still means that UNOS is failing to identify and remediate problems in the system.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Yes, to Kevin’s point, transportation is a problem, but there are also ten other problems. I think that should only increase the urgency. Perversely, sometimes it just increases the feelings of fatalism in government.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>GS:</strong><span> That is also a contributing problem, but let me give some context on how having an antiquated technology system exacerbates the problem. Remember, every organ is on a clock, and only good for so long. If I’m a surgeon, my patient is first on the list, and I'm offered the organ but for regulatory or perverse incentive, I don't want to take it for my patient, it goes to the next patient on the list. This becomes problematic because the technology is decades old. Seventeen percent of kidneys are </span><strong><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6724162/" rel="">offered to at least one deceased person</a></strong><span> before they are transplanted, because the system doesn’t do appropriate data hygiene to pull deceased patients off of the list.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Are there also things that can be addressed for transplant centers? Absolutely. UNOS could make their technology nimble so that it's easy to go down the list, whether the surgeons are passing the kidney for a good or bad reason. They could identify policy problems, OPO behavior, or surgeon behavior, and go to regulatory bodies like CMS to demand they fix it. UNOS hasn’t done that. If you really press them into a corner, they’ll sometimes explain that there are lots of problems, but they have no track record of looking for solutions.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>JE:</strong><span> What I hope comes across is that this has been an effort across multiple administrations, with both political parties and two branches of government working to fix the system. It’s still not done, so we have to keep going. To win a policy fight, you have to win the same argument multiple times, and it’s important to stay vigilant beyond the regulation or law or front page story, until implementation actually affects people's lives.</span></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote>“The ability to do authorization queries over data in our existing database reduces architectural complexity and is a big technical win for us. We’re super excited to take advantage of it.” – Anthony Cristiano, Staff Software Engineer, Headway</blockquote><p>Authorization as a Service. The reality falls short of the promise. That’s because to use an authorization service, you have to send it a lot of application data. Any solution that signs you up for a data synchronization process isn’t providing a service. It’s creating a burden.</p><p>When we started work on Oso, we knew this. It’s one of the key problems we set out to solve. Today we’re taking a major step towards realizing that vision with the release of <strong><em>Distributed Authorization</em></strong>.</p><p>Distributed Authorization lets you apply your application data to authorization decisions without synchronizing it to Oso Cloud. Instead, you distribute authorization decisions between the Oso Cloud service and the Oso Cloud client in your application.</p><p>This may sound counterintuitive – shouldn’t an authorization service answer authorization questions on its own? Surprisingly, no.</p><p>In this post, we’ll show you how we reached that conclusion and why we’re so excited about Distributed Authorization.</p><h2>DIY Authorization: Good until it Isn’t</h2><p>Authorization starts with a question. Consider <a href="https://github.com/osohq/gitcloud">gitcloud</a>, our sample version control app. You may be asked this question: May <code>alice</code> <code>read</code> the <code>amazing-app</code> repository? In order to answer this question you need two things: logic and data. The logic might be:</p><p>A <code>user</code> may <code>read</code> a <code>repository</code> in their <code>organization</code> if they have the <code>maintainer</code> or <code>admin</code> role on that <code>repository</code> </p><p>The data might be:</p><ul role="list"><li><code>alice</code> is a member of the <code>acme</code> organization.</li><li>the <code>acme</code> organization contains the <code>amazing-app</code> repository</li><li><code>alice</code> has the <code>maintainer</code> role on the <code>amazing-app</code> repository</li></ul><p>By combining the logic and the data, we get our answer: <code>alice</code> can <code>read</code> the <code>amazing-app</code> repository.</p><p>In the early stages of an application, this logic usually lives in the application code, and the data in the application database. For the case of our simple question above, that might look like this:</p><pre contenteditable="false"><code><span>// Get this user's roles on the repo</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>const</span><span> userRoles = db.getUserRoles({ </span><span>userId</span><span>: user.id, </span><span>repoId</span><span>: issue.repoId});
</span>
<span></span><span>// Check whether the user has a role that confers read access</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>if</span><span>(!userRoles.some(</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>) =&gt;</span><span> [</span><span>"maintainer"</span><span>, </span><span>"admin"</span><span>].includes(r)) {
</span><span>   </span><span>throw</span><span> </span><span>new</span><span> PermissionDeniedRoleRequired(</span><span>"maintainer"</span><span>);
</span>}</code></pre><pre contenteditable="false"><code><span># SQL </span><span>for</span><span> getting the repository roles </span><span>for</span><span> a user.
</span><span>select </span><span>"role"</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>from</span><span> repository_role rr
</span>join repository r on rr.repo_id = r.id
join organization_member om on r.org_id = om.org_id
where om.user_id = ?
    and r.id = ?</code></pre><p>If your authorization logic isn’t much more complicated than that, this works just fine. But over time, authorization questions and logic both tend to become more complex.</p><ul role="list"><li>It becomes cumbersome to manage roles at the repository level, so you allow users to inherit roles on repositories from their role in the organization.</li><li>You start getting a lot of requests to add new roles to gitcloud, so you give users the ability to create custom roles with configurable permission</li><li>You add an Issue feature to gitcloud, so repo users have a way to report bugs.</li></ul><p>Great news – your Issue feature is taking off! In fact, it’s so popular that your users request a list of Issues that they have permission to triage, because it’s getting hard to keep track of them. You decide that a user can <code>triage</code> an issue if:</p><ul role="list"><li>They created the <code>issue</code> <em>or</em></li><li>They have the <code>triage</code> role on the <code>repository</code> that contains the <code>issue</code> <em>or</em></li><li>They have the <code>triage </code>role on the <code>organization</code> that contains the <code>repository </code><em>or</em></li><li>They have a <code>custom role</code> that grants them the necessary permissions</li></ul><p>This looks something like this:</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f1483105c9a72fd0a3b662a/661e789326b81c5224d68c46_Authz-logic-complex.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Sample code left as an exercise for the reader.</figcaption></figure><p>Good luck sifting through that code 6 months from now when you want to figure out the rules for granting triage access to a user.</p><h2>Policy As Code: Decouple Authorization Logic From Application Logic</h2><p>Your application has an authorization policy, whether you build it explicitly or not. When you mix application logic and authorization logic in your application code, you make that policy implicit. The problem with things that are implicit is that they’re easy to misunderstand, or to miss entirely. Suppose you decide to add teams to gitcloud, so different teams in an organization can have different permissions. Will you be able to find all the functions and queries you need to modify in order to make teams work properly? Do you want to have to do that?</p><p>This is why we introduced <a href="https://www.osohq.com/docs/reference/polar/foundations">Polar</a>, our declarative DSL for authorization. Polar allows you to separate your authorization logic from your application logic and express it in a language that is purpose built for authorization. A simple Polar policy looks something like this:</p><pre contenteditable="false"><code><span>allow(user: User, </span><span>"read"</span><span>, </span><span>org</span><span>: Organization) </span><span>if</span><span>
</span><span>	has_role(user, </span><span>"member"</span><span>, org);
</span>	
<span>has_role(User{</span><span>"alice"</span><span>}, </span><span>"member"</span><span>, Organization{</span><span>"acme"</span><span>});</span></code></pre><p>We’ve specified the entities we’re interested in: <code>User</code> and <code>Organization</code>. We’ve defined the conditions that allow a given <code>User</code> to <code>read</code> an <code>Organization</code>, in terms of the <code>member</code> role. Finally, we’ve asserted that <code>alice</code> has the <code>member</code> role on the <code>acme</code> organization.</p><p>Like any new language, it takes a little getting used to if you haven’t worked with Polar before, but we can see from this example that it’s both concise and expressive. These are important characteristics if our aim is to make your authorization logic explicit. If you had to wade through a bunch of confusing syntax to divine that logic, we would have done a lot of work for nothing.</p><p>Explicit policy is a big improvement for complex authorization logic. Now we needed to let you take advantage of that policy in your code. This is why we built the Oso library.</p><h2>Oso Library: Authorization for Monoliths</h2><p>The Oso library represented our initial implementation of a client to Polar. There was a lot to like about it. It was open source. It operated directly over your data. It integrated tightly with your application. With your policy defined in Polar and the open source library embedded in your application, you could find out whether <code>alice</code> can <code>read</code> a <code>repository</code> like this:</p><pre contenteditable="false"><code><span>@app.route(</span><span>"/repo/&lt;name&gt;"</span><span>)
</span>def repo_show(name):
    repo = Repository.get_by_name(name)

<span>    </span><span>try</span><span>:
</span><span>        oso.authorize(User.get_current_user(), </span><span>"read"</span><span>, repo)
</span>        
<span>        </span><span>return</span><span> f</span><span>"&lt;h1&gt;A Repo&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to repo {repo.name}&lt;/p&gt;"</span><span>, </span><span>200</span><span>
</span>    except NotFoundError:
<span>        </span><span>return</span><span> f</span><span>"&lt;h1&gt;Whoops!&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repo named {name} was not found&lt;/p&gt;"</span><span>, </span><span>404</span></code></pre><p>The beauty of this was that as your authorization logic gets more complicated, the application code stayed just this simple. You expressed the authorization logic in a .polar file, where you could version and inspect it alongside your application code. When you needed to ask if a given user was authorized to perform a given action, you always asked the same question, in exactly those terms:</p><pre contenteditable="false"><code><span>oso.authorize(&lt;User&gt;, &lt;action&gt;, &lt;resource&gt;)</span></code></pre><p>As powerful as this was, over time we learned that the library approach has some significant downsides.</p><p>The library got access to application data via a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/ffi.html">foreign function interface</a> (FFI). This was clever (and fun) engineering, but the mental model tripped up a lot of developers, and made things hard to debug.</p><p>There was no standard data model. This was part of the point – we built the library to operate over your data. As convenient as it was to have direct access to that data, in practice we observed performance issues and inconsistent behavior caused by details of the underlying data model that we could neither see nor change ourselves. This lack of standardization also made it hard for us to build new capabilities on top of the library.</p><p>But the main problem was this: the library was a great solution if you have a single service. A lot of people, however, have more than one service! For these people, the library approach only solved a piece of the puzzle.</p><h2>Oso Cloud: Authorization for Microservices</h2><p>When your application is a monolith, it’s straightforward to implement your authorization logic with something like the Oso library. You write your logic in a <code>.polar</code> file that lives in the same repository as all the rest of your code. Then you load it when you initialize the client. Finally, you issue authorization requests against the loaded policy. You don’t have to worry about data, because it’s all in a single database that all your code can access.</p><p>But when you break your application up into multiple services, you introduce new questions. Which service should own the authorization model? There’s no good answer, because the model needs data to be effective, and that data is now split across services. Can each service have its own model? No, because authorization questions often span services. Let’s go back to deciding whether <code>alice</code> can triage an <code>Issue</code>.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f1483105c9a72fd0a3b662a/661e79566ab74177a2807255_Multi-Service-Auth.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>The Issue service knows whether <code>alice</code> created the issue. The Repository service knows whether <code>alice</code> has the <code>triage</code> role on the repository, and the User service knows whether <code>alice</code> has the <code>triage</code> role on the organization. So now you’re making multiple API calls to figure out whether <code>alice</code> can <code>triage</code> the issue.</p><p>The design that ends up making the most sense is to have a dedicated service for authorization, but now you have to build your own APIs, create your own data model, figure out how to design change control. It’s a lot of work.</p><p>So our next step was to take that work on. We designed Oso Cloud to solve authorization in multi-service environments. This let us address two persistent issues in the library model:</p><ul role="list"><li>We built a hosted solution that could be shared by all services in an application.</li><li>We defined a consistent data model for authorization data.</li></ul><p>The Oso Cloud data model is called <a href="https://www.osohq.com/docs/concepts/oso-cloud-data-model">facts</a>. Facts are a lightweight, flexible format that can represent any authorization data in your application.</p><p>Oso Cloud brings the benefits of policy as code to multi-service applications. You can make your authorization logic explicit, share it amongst all of your services, and represent your authorization data in a standard format that’s optimized for authorization operations. But now we’ve recreated exactly the problem we set out to solve: you have to sync your application data to our service.</p><h2>Authorization as a Service: Excessive Centralization</h2><p>Let’s take a look back at why we started down this road. Our application got brittle because the application logic and the authorization logic were intertwined. We wanted to make authorization logic explicit, and in order to do that in a way that worked for microservices, we created a hosted service that provides the benefits of Polar behind an API.</p><p>To answer authorization questions, we need more than logic. We also need data. And in that respect, Oso Cloud suffers from the same limitation that all centralized authorization services do. It needs that data to exist <em>in the service</em>.</p><p>But that’s our problem, not yours. You already have that data where you need it: in your application. By requiring you to convert it to facts and synchronize it to Oso Cloud, we’re making our lives easier at the cost of making yours harder. Now you have to deal with potentially massive initial data loads, distributed transactions, sync and replication processes, detecting drift. None of this is easy.</p><p>We know it’s not easy, because you’ve told us it isn’t. The good news is that this was never the end state for us.</p><h2>Distributed Authorization: Microservices done right</h2><p>What we really want to do is let you centralize your authorization logic without centralizing all of your authorization data. To do this, we have to let go of a fundamental assumption of Authorization as a Service: that the service has to answer the question independently. It’s this requirement that makes it necessary for the authorization service to have <em>all of your application data</em>.</p><p>What if, instead, you could centralize your logic and your common authorization data (things like roles) in the authorization service, and then distribute the evaluation of authorization questions between the server and the client? That’s Distributed Authorization. Instead of only answering <code>yes</code> or <code>no</code>, Oso Cloud can now respond to an authorization question with <code>yes, if</code>.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f1483105c9a72fd0a3b662a/661e7985c375a2d9548dd6df_LF-AaaS-Distributed.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>That <code>yes, if</code> is followed by a list of conditions that are evaluated at the client using your local data. You give the Oso Cloud client a configuration file that tells it how to test those conditions by converting your application data to facts. At authorization time, the Oso Cloud service evaluates as much of the request as it knows, and then hands off the remainder to the Oso Cloud client in your application.</p><h2>A Practical Application: Filtering Lists</h2><p>One area where this shines is filtering lists of authorized data. We’ve already talked about how painful it can be to get your application data into a centralized authorization service. It can also be painful to get it back out. If you want to generate a list of Issues that <code>alice</code> can <code>triage</code> and all of your data is centralized in your authorization service, then the operation looks like this:</p><ul role="list"><li>Ask the service for a list of Issue IDs that <code>alice</code> can <code>triage</code></li><li>Get the full list of IDs back from the service</li><li>Use the list of IDs to query your local database for Issue data</li></ul><p>This is how the <code>oso.list</code> command works, and it works great in a lot of cases.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f1483105c9a72fd0a3b662a/661e79a2d8205c333e9fce74_List-Filtering-Centralized.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>For users who belong to multiple organizations, or who belong to organizations with very active repositories, that list of Issues can get very long! It's not hard to envision situations where a user has access to hundreds or thousands of issues. That’s a lot of data going across the internet before you’re able to use it in your application.</p><p>Oso Cloud now supports <a href="https://www.osohq.com/docs/guides/integrate/filter-lists">List Filtering using Distributed Data</a>. When you use local data to generate lists of authorized resources, rather than returning the full list of resources, Oso Cloud instead returns a (much shorter) query filter to the client. The client then uses this filter to construct the full list from your locally stored data. You get your response back from Oso faster, and because you generate the list in your local database, you can sort and paginate the results using the tools you're already using to handle large sets of application data.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f1483105c9a72fd0a3b662a/661e79bea17ed6490e2c61a9_List-Filtering-Distributed.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>Bringing our Vision into Focus</h2><blockquote>“Our team was looking for a new authorization system. We assessed a number of technologies (plus building our own) and Oso's distributed architecture, in-depth auth knowledge, and 99.99% uptime were key reasons why we chose Oso.” – Guhan Venguswamy, Head of Platform Engineering, Jasper.ai</blockquote><p>With Distributed Authorization, you get the the benefits of explicit authorization logic without the penalty of centralizing all your authorization data. It’s Authorization as a Service that works with your application, rather than forcing you to rework your application to work with it.</p><p>This is a major milestone for us, but we know the job’s not done. We’re continuing to make it easier for you to centralize the data that you do want to keep in Oso Cloud. We’re enhancing Polar to make it even more flexible and robust. And we haven’t forgotten about monoliths – although the Oso library is now deprecated, we’re working on bringing these capabilities to you too!</p><p>In the coming weeks, we’ll be sharing more on how Distributed Authorization works under the hood, and the different ways customers like Headway and Jasper.ai are already using it. </p><p>If you’d like to learn more about how to use it in your app, <a href="https://www.osohq.com/docs/guides/integrate/filter-lists?utm_content=distributedauthz_launchpost#list-filtering-with-decentralized-data">check our our docs for Distributed Authorization and List Filtering</a>. </p><p>Do you have questions or want to share your thoughts? <a href="https://join-slack.osohq.com/">Reach out to us on Slack</a> or <a href="https://calendly.com/osohq/oso-cloud-1-on-1?utm_content=distributed_authz_launchpost">Schedule a 1x1 with an Engineer</a>!

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-v-444dbe18="">This is a visual guide to Vision Transformers (ViTs), a class of deep learning models that have achieved state-of-the-art performance on image classification tasks. Vision Transformers apply the transformer architecture, originally designed for natural language processing (NLP), to image data. This guide will walk you through the key components of Vision Transformers in a scroll story format, using visualizations and simple explanations to help you understand how these models work and how the flow of the data through the model looks like.</p><p data-v-444dbe18="">Like normal convolutional neural networks, vision transformers are trained in a supervised manner. This means that the model is trained on a dataset of images and their corresponding labels.</p><div data-v-444dbe18=""><!----><div data-v-444dbe18=""><h3 data-v-444dbe18="">1) Focus on one data point </h3><p data-v-444dbe18="">To get a better understanding of what happens inside a vision transformer lets focus on a single data point (batch size of 1). And lets ask the question: How is this data point prepared in order to be consumed by a transformer?</p></div><div data-v-444dbe18=""><h3 data-v-444dbe18="">2) Forget the label for the moment</h3><p data-v-444dbe18="">The label will become more relevant later. For now the only thing that we are left with is a single image.</p></div><div data-v-444dbe18=""><h3 data-v-444dbe18="">3) Create patches of the image</h3><p data-v-444dbe18="">To prepare the image for the use inside the transformer we divide the image into equally sized patches of size <strong data-v-444dbe18="">p x p</strong>.</p></div><div data-v-444dbe18=""><h3 data-v-444dbe18="">4) Flatting of the images patches</h3><p data-v-444dbe18="">The patches are now flattened into vectors of dimension <strong data-v-444dbe18=""> p'= p²*c </strong> where <strong data-v-444dbe18=""> p </strong> is the size of the patch and <strong data-v-444dbe18=""> c </strong> is the number of channels.</p></div><div data-v-444dbe18=""><h3 data-v-444dbe18="">5) Creating patch embeddings</h3><p data-v-444dbe18="">These image patch vectors are now encoded using a linear transformation. The resulting <strong data-v-444dbe18="">Patch Embedding Vector</strong> has a fixed size <strong data-v-444dbe18="">d</strong>.</p></div><div data-v-444dbe18=""><h3 data-v-444dbe18="">6) Embedding all patches</h3><p data-v-444dbe18="">Now that we have embedded our image patches into vectors of fixed size, we are left with an array of size <strong data-v-444dbe18="">n x d</strong> where <strong data-v-444dbe18=""> n </strong> is the the number of image patches and <strong data-v-444dbe18=""> d </strong> is the size of the <strong data-v-444dbe18="">patch embedding</strong></p></div><div data-v-444dbe18=""><h3 data-v-444dbe18="">7) Appending a classification token</h3><p data-v-444dbe18="">In order for us to effectively train our model we extend the array of patch embeddings by an additional vector called <strong data-v-444dbe18="">classification token (cls token)</strong>. This vector is a learnable parameter of the network and is randomly initialized. Note: We only have one cls token and we append the same vector for all data points.</p></div><div data-v-444dbe18=""><h3 data-v-444dbe18="">8) Add positional embedding Vectors</h3><p data-v-444dbe18="">Currently our <strong data-v-444dbe18=""> patch embeddings </strong> have no positional information associated with them. We remedy that by adding a learnable randomly initialized <strong data-v-444dbe18="">positional embedding vector</strong> to all our patch embeddings. We also add a such a positional embedding vector to our <strong data-v-444dbe18=""> classification token</strong>.</p></div><div data-v-444dbe18=""><h3 data-v-444dbe18="">9) Transformer Input</h3><p data-v-444dbe18="">After the positional embedding vectors have been added we are left with an array of size <strong data-v-444dbe18=""> (n+1) x d </strong>. This will be our input for the transformer which will be explained in greater detail in the next steps</p></div><div data-v-444dbe18=""><h3 data-v-444dbe18="">10.1) Transformer: QKV Creation </h3><p data-v-444dbe18="">Our transformer input patch embedding vectors are linearly embedded into multiple large vectors. These new vectors are than separated into three equal sized parts. The <strong data-v-444dbe18=""> Q - Query Vector</strong>, the <strong data-v-444dbe18=""> K - Key Vector </strong> and the <strong data-v-444dbe18=""> V - Value Vector </strong>. We will have (n+1) of a all of those vectors. </p></div><div data-v-444dbe18=""><h3 data-v-444dbe18="">10.2) Transformer: Attention Score Calculation </h3><p data-v-444dbe18="">To calculate our attention scores A we will now multiply all of our query vectors Q with all of our key vectors K.</p></div><div data-v-444dbe18=""><h3 data-v-444dbe18="">10.3)Transformer: Attention Score Matrix </h3><p data-v-444dbe18="">Now that we have the attention score matrix A we apply a `softmax` function to every row such that every row sums up to 1.</p></div><div data-v-444dbe18=""><h3 data-v-444dbe18="">10.4)Transformer: Aggregated Contextual Information Calculation </h3><p data-v-444dbe18="">To calculate the <strong data-v-444dbe18="">aggregated contextual information</strong> for the first patch embedding vector. We focus on the <strong data-v-444dbe18="">first row</strong> of the attention matrix. And use the entires as weights for our <strong data-v-444dbe18="">Value Vectors V</strong>. The result is our <strong data-v-444dbe18="">aggregated contextual information</strong> vector for the first image patch embedding.</p></div><div data-v-444dbe18=""><h3 data-v-444dbe18="">10.5)Transformer: Aggregated Contextual Information for every patch</h3><p data-v-444dbe18="">Now we repeat this process for every row of our attention score matrix and the result will be N+1 aggregated contextual information vectors. One for every patch + one for the classification token. This steps concludes our first Attention Head.</p></div><div data-v-444dbe18=""><h3 data-v-444dbe18="">10.6)Transformer: Multi-Head Attention</h3><p data-v-444dbe18="">Now because we are dealing multi head attention we repeat the entire process from step <strong data-v-444dbe18="">10.1 - 10-5</strong> again with a different QKV mapping. For our explanatory setup we assume 2 Heads but typically a VIT has many more. In the end this results in multiple Aggregated contextual information vectors.</p></div><div data-v-444dbe18=""><h3 data-v-444dbe18="">10.7)Transformer: Last Attention Layer Step</h3><p data-v-444dbe18="">These heads are stacked together and are mapped to vectors of size <strong data-v-444dbe18="">d</strong> which was the same size as our patch embeddings had.</p></div><div data-v-444dbe18=""><h3 data-v-444dbe18="">10.8)Transformer: Attention Layer Result</h3><p data-v-444dbe18="">The previous step concluded the attention layer and we are left with the same amount of embeddings of <strong data-v-444dbe18="">exactly the same size</strong> as we used as input.</p></div><div data-v-444dbe18=""><h3 data-v-444dbe18="">10.9)Transformer: Residual connections</h3><p data-v-444dbe18="">Transformers make heavy use of <strong data-v-444dbe18="">residual connections</strong> which simply means adding the input of the previous layer to the output the current layer. This is also something that we will do now. </p></div><div data-v-444dbe18=""><h3 data-v-444dbe18="">10.10)Transformer: Residual connection Result</h3><p data-v-444dbe18="">The addition results in vectors of the same size. </p></div><div data-v-444dbe18=""><h3 data-v-444dbe18="">10.11)Transformer: Feed Forward Network </h3><p data-v-444dbe18="">Now these outputs are feed through a feed forward neural network with non linear activation functions</p></div><div data-v-444dbe18=""><h3 data-v-444dbe18="">10.12)Transformer: Final Result </h3><p data-v-444dbe18="">After the transformer step there is another residual connections which we will skip here for brevity. And so the last step concluded the transformer layer. In the end the transformer produced outputs of the same size as input.</p></div><div data-v-444dbe18=""><h3 data-v-444dbe18="">11) Repeat Transformers </h3><p data-v-444dbe18="">Repeat the entire transformer calculation <strong data-v-444dbe18="">Steps 10.1 - Steps 10.12</strong> for the Transformer several times e.g. 6 times.</p></div><div data-v-444dbe18=""><h3 data-v-444dbe18="">12) Identify Classification token output</h3><p data-v-444dbe18="">Last step is to identify the classification token output. This vector will be used in the final step of our Vision Transformer journey.</p></div><div data-v-444dbe18=""><h3 data-v-444dbe18="">13) Final Step: Predicting classification probabilities</h3><p data-v-444dbe18="">In the final and last step we use this classification output token and another fully connected neural network to predict the classification probabilities of our input image.</p></div></div><p data-v-444dbe18="">We train the Vision Transformer using a standard cross-entropy loss function, which compares the predicted class probabilities with the true class labels. The model is trained using backpropagation and gradient descent, updating the model parameters to minimize the loss function.</p><p data-v-444dbe18="">In this visual guide, we have walked through the key components of Vision Transformers, from the data preparation to the training of the model. We hope this guide has helped you understand how Vision Transformers work and how they can be used to classify images.</p><p data-v-444dbe18="">I prepared this little <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1r_cmWE9RbjkwyqKbhnX5GAtenoFvBurM?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" data-v-444dbe18="">Colab Notebook</a> to help you understand the Vision Transformer even better.

In our view, one of the key reasons this topic hasn’t been successfully “framework-ified” is that most folks still talk about the concept in generalities.&nbsp;</p><p>Fish are jumping into the boat. Leads are falling on the floor. You’re chasing — not pushing — a boulder. The product is being pulled out of your hands. You’ll know it when you see it. You can feel when it’s <i>not</i> happening. These descriptions lack the specificity that we see in other areas of company building.</p><p>Another issue? Most resources target a wide range of builders — which results in watered-down advice that’s more hand-wavy than tactical. Founders are left with approaches that are neither replicable nor practical, ranging from unhelpful “We kind of just started going viral” founding stories to one-size-fits-all frameworks that don’t address the nuances of their specific business.&nbsp;</p><p>While the hunt for PMF can be more of a dice game with poor odds for, say, consumer apps, <b>our experience has taught us that for sales-led B2B companies, you </b><b><i>can</i></b><b> reduce the role of luck.&nbsp;</b></p><p>Here’s how we’ve developed that conviction: As a firm of former founders and startup builders, we’re coming up on our 20th year of investing in pre-product-market fit startups. Along with Square, Notion, Looker, and Verkada, we’ve backed hundreds of companies when they were just a couple of founders and an idea.</p><p>Drawing on our own data and observations from more than 500 investments, we’ve spent the last several years breaking down the decade-long project of building a category-defining B2B company into more concrete steps — in hopes that we could create this resource that we feel is missing from the ecosystem.</p></div></div><h3>To put it even more plainly: Despite all the talk about product-market fit, it didn’t seem like anyone was meaningfully putting the pieces together to help B2B founders increase their odds of finding it. We wanted to change that.</h3><p>In addition to distilling lessons from decades of our own experience, we’ve layered on hundreds of hours of research and interviewed dozens of founders who’ve gotten further on this journey than most, from both within and outside of our community. (If you’re a regular reader of The Review, you may have noticed that we’ve started publishing some of these stories in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://review.firstround.com/series/product-market-fit"><u>our series Paths to PMF</u></a> — focusing on the down-in-the-weeds details of how companies from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://review.firstround.com/vantas-path-to-product-market-fit/"><u>Vanta</u></a> to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://review.firstround.com/vercels-path-to-product-market-fit/"><u>Vercel</u></a> took off.)</p><p>As the culmination of that work, <b>today we’re proud to unveil </b><a href="https://pmf.firstround.com/home"><b>Product-Market Fit Method</b></a>,<b> an intensive 14-week experience designed to help exceptional pre-seed founders build epic B2B SaaS companies</b>. From proven tactics to detailed benchmarks that help founders gauge progress, we’ve mined the secrets that are buried in the best B2B builders’ experiences to create a new methodology that helps startups take a straighter path to PMF.</p><p>The program (which kicks off on May 29 and can be applied for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://first-round-website.vercel.app/apply">here</a>) consists of eight tactical sessions. We’ll cover everything from validating your product insight and market, to approaching positioning, design partners, and product iteration, to learning the ropes of what we call “dollar-driven discovery” and founder-led sales.</p><p>While this is currently a highly-curated program with a limited number of spots, our tradition here at First Round has been to open-source everything we can to share what we’ve learned with the broader startup ecosystem — whether it’s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://review.firstround.com/100-best-bits-of-advice-from-first-round-review"><u>a decade of advice on The Review</u></a> or years spent building <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://angeltrack.firstround.com/"><u>communities like Angel Track</u></a>. In keeping with that spirit, <b>we’ve decided to publish the content of the first session in full, as a preview</b>.&nbsp;</p><p>No commitment to applying. No email paywall (although of course, we’d highly recommend subscribing to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://review.firstround.com/newsletter/"><u>The Review newsletter</u></a>). No charge. And no equity required for the program either — our aim is to increase the odds that more founders find product-market fit, whether they’re backed by First Round or not.</p><h3>The deck may seem stacked, but we're on a mission to rebalance the odds in the early founder's favor. We’re firm believers that you don’t have to go at it alone — and you don’t have to make it all up as you go either.</h3><p>We’ve taken a systematic approach to defining <i>what</i> product-market fit is and identifying truly tactical steps for <i>how</i> to go about finding it. <b>But to be very clear, the first session that we’re open-sourcing here is all about exploring the former, breaking down the elements of PMF so it’s easier to unlock.</b> The rest of the sessions in PMF Method tackle the latter in much greater detail — with expert-led workshops, practical exercises and templates, actual customer introductions, and unique access to our network of established founders and angel investors.</p><p>With that, let’s dive in.</p></div></section><section id="levels-of-pmf"><div><p>INTRODUCING EXTREME PRODUCT-MARKET FIT</p></div><div><p><span>L</span>et’s start with the obvious question: What is product-market fit? Here’s our specific definition of what founders are aiming for — and why it’s a bit different from what you may have seen before:</p><h3>Extreme product-market fit is a state of widespread demand for a product that satisfies a critical need and — crucially — can be delivered repeatably and efficiently to each customer.</h3><p>As we’ve noted, the way most people have talked about product-market fit feels insufficient. More specifically, there are certain nuances that we feel haven't yet been adequately addressed:</p><div><ul><li><p><b>Product-market fit progresses in levels</b>. It’s not a binary state where you have it and you’re golden, or you don’t and you’re not on the path. But it’s also not a vague spectrum or fuzzy sliding scale, where you can’t be sure where you’re at.</p></li><li><p><b>There are a few dimensions of PMF that are in tension with each other, requiring deliberate tradeoffs at each level</b>. There isn’t just one element to emphasize above all else. And importantly, there are different times in a company’s lifespan where founders need to intentionally prioritize one over another.</p></li><li><p><b>There isn’t nearly enough emphasis on repeatability</b>. As you move your way up through the different levels of product-market fit, what you’re really unlocking is repeatability — across demand generation, product development, customer satisfaction and unit economics. A startup hasn’t reached the upper levels of product-market fit until it has developed a fine-grained understanding of who the right customer is, how to land them, and how to deliver a product that (in most cases) isn’t bespoke for each customer yet consistently solves a significant need. In a nutshell, you don’t have to work as hard to find what we’re calling your “marginal customer” (more on that in the section below).&nbsp;</p></li></ul></div><h3>Repeatability is the holy grail on the hunt for product-market fit.

Some companies move up the progression over a longer period of time, while others skip ahead at different moments, leapfrogging from nascent to strong, for example. In our experience, there are a couple of specific timing patterns here that companies fall into, whether it’s making their way through Levels 1-3 quickly but stalling out and never quite hitting Level 4, or reaching Level 1 in record time but then getting trapped at Level 2.</p><p>We’ll also note that the journey to PMF is a two-way ladder, meaning levels aren’t permanently unlocked — it is possible to regress. To use another metaphor, think of it more as a dynamic equilibrium. Just like in chemistry, your actions, your competitors’ actions, customer expectations, technology shifts and other factors are all at a tentative equilibrium state. If one of those elements changes — maybe your competitor makes a huge leap forward — and you don’t adjust, you may not be at the same level of PMF anymore. (For another take on this topic, we recommend three-time founder <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertjmoore/"><u>Bob Moore</u></a>’s framework <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://review.firstround.com/this-founder-built-startups-in-2008-2016-and-2018-heres-what-hes-learned-about-resiliency/#2-productmarket-fit-doesn%E2%80%99t-mean-you%E2%80%99re-in-the-clear"><u>here</u></a>.)</p><p>We’ll get deep into the details of what progressing through each level feels like further down, but staying at our current altitude, there’s one high-level question you can ask here if you’re unsure where your company stacks up: <b>How hard is it to find and serve your next “marginal” customer?</b> As you move up, it becomes easier and easier, and increasingly more repeatable.</p><p>At Levels 3 and 4, for example, demand swells. Contrast that with Levels 1 and 2, where the search for the marginal customer feels more like a battle on several fronts — finding the right person, convincing them that your solution is what they need, converting them, and turning them into satisfied customers.</p><h4><p>The 3 Dimensions of Product-Market Fit</p></h4><p>We like to break that definition down even further into what we call <b>the three dimensions of product-market fit</b>:</p><div><ul><li><p><b>Satisfaction: </b>How happy are customers with the product? Are you able to effectively retain customers? How much do people <i>need</i> the product? It may seem like splitting hairs, but we’ll note that we’ve intentionally used “need” and not “love” here — there are many companies that have extreme PMF <i>without</i> customer love. (Salesforce is an example of a product that’s perhaps not beloved, but certainly satisfies a critical customer need.)</p></li><li><p><b>Demand: </b>Do you have the proverbial “lines out the door”? How quickly and how much can you sell your product for?&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><b>Efficiency: </b>Can the product grow repeatably and scale effectively? In our view, this is the critical piece that many definitions of PMF gloss over — even though it’s one of the most important things that a company must achieve. Here’s how we like to break it down: efficiency in finding the customer (CAC), selling and closing the customer (sales conversion, magic number, CAC payback), in activating and supporting the customer (length of integration cycle, NRR), in producing the product (COGS, gross margin), and across the company as a whole (burn multiple).</p></li></ul></div><p>Some may bristle at that last one. Most other definitions of product-market fit overtly focus on satisfaction and demand, implying that efficiency takes care of itself in the long run. <b>But our belief is that while your business won’t be efficient from day one — and may in fact be intentionally </b><b><i>inefficient</i></b><b> while you work to figure things out at Level 1 — there is tremendous value in building with an eye towards efficiency throughout your entire journey as a founder.</b></p><p>As a thought exercise, say you open up a stand on the side of the road where anyone who lines up and gives you $1 gets $100 in return. By classic definitions, product-market fit would be off the charts. You'd have lines out the door. Customers would be very satisfied. But it would be a mirage. And a particularly dangerous one at that, given the risk that you’ll lull yourself into the false belief that you’ve unlocked PMF.&nbsp;</p></div></div><h3>When you’re starting a marathon, it’s helpful to know what the final mile needs to look like — even if you don’t alter your approach to mile 1. If you keep efficiency in the back of your mind even at the earlier stages, you’ll be able to stay intentional in the tradeoffs you’re making as you build.</h3><p>One final note here: These dimensions are actually highly intertwined — and require distinct tradeoffs in different scenarios. For example, you can take on several initiatives to increase efficiency — spending less time doing unscalable things, automating and operationalizing more aspects of your business — but in many instances, that harms the customer experience, reducing satisfaction. (Of course, there are times where there’s more harmony than discord — for example, shipping a critical product feature might improve all three at once.)</p><figure><img alt="" _uid="i-c31554b3-f874-4461-83fb-5f1addc51497" loading="eager" width="1" height="1" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2F9aca4f0b07%2Fthe-intertwined-dimensions-of-pmf.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=90 640w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2F9aca4f0b07%2Fthe-intertwined-dimensions-of-pmf.png&amp;w=750&amp;q=90 750w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2F9aca4f0b07%2Fthe-intertwined-dimensions-of-pmf.png&amp;w=828&amp;q=90 828w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2F9aca4f0b07%2Fthe-intertwined-dimensions-of-pmf.png&amp;w=1080&amp;q=90 1080w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2F9aca4f0b07%2Fthe-intertwined-dimensions-of-pmf.png&amp;w=1200&amp;q=90 1200w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2F9aca4f0b07%2Fthe-intertwined-dimensions-of-pmf.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=90 1920w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2F9aca4f0b07%2Fthe-intertwined-dimensions-of-pmf.png&amp;w=2048&amp;q=90 2048w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2F9aca4f0b07%2Fthe-intertwined-dimensions-of-pmf.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=90 3840w" src="https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2F9aca4f0b07%2Fthe-intertwined-dimensions-of-pmf.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=90"></figure><h4>The First Round 4Ps: Levers to Get Unstuck on Your Path to Product-Market Fit</h4><p>As for how you can get unstuck and catapult your company to the next level, you can experiment with <b>pulling these four levers at various points along your journey</b> (our spin on the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/4-ps-of-marketing"><u>classic 4Ps framework</u></a>):</p><div><ul><li><p><b>The persona:</b> Who would benefit most from your insight? Do you have a person in a specific type of role or function who faces a set of challenges in mind? In this context, the persona can be the buyer (CTO or CRO), the company type (e.g. Fortune 10,000 financial services) or both. As you look to make adjustments here, consider whether it’s too narrow, too broad — or needs to be abandoned altogether. <i>&nbsp;Example from Plaid: Consumers didn’t need another budgeting app, but fintech apps needed the integrations the team had built on the back-end.</i></p></li><li><p><b>The problem: </b>Is this an urgent and important problem that your target persona has? It’s the classic painkiller versus vitamin question. You’re looking to solve a problem that is urgent and, if solved, will provide huge relief to your potential customers. If not, you may need to explore adjacent problems for your persona, or rethink your persona and problem entirely.<i> Example from Lattice: Stayed focused on people leaders, but went from building a solution for OKRs to solving performance management.</i></p></li><li><p><b>The promise</b>: Are those customers interested in what you’ll do to address that need — your unique value proposition? It’s easy to confuse this for your actual product, but the promise is how you communicate the benefit your product will deliver. In our experience, this is the lever that is most overlooked.<i> Example from Ironclad: Repositioned from an AI legal assistant (that promised to automate lawyers’ tasks) to a Contract Lifecycle Management platform (that promised to help enterprise companies create and manage legal contracts end-to-end) in order to play in an existing category.</i></p></li><li><p><b>The product</b>: Will the product that you’re building actually deliver on this promise? Are customers interested in this particular solution to their problem? Would they pay for it? <i>Example from </i><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://helloalma.com/our-mission/"><i><u>Alma</u></i></a><i>: Pivoted during the pandemic from a community-based physical office concept for therapists, to giving providers a suite of digital tools to build thriving private practices.</i></p></li></ul></div><p>For example, a startup might be stuck at developing PMF, but later find that pivoting to a new buyer is the move that unlocks the next level. Or another company may have stumbled onto nascent PMF with resonant positioning, but then can’t ship the correct product that delivers on its promise.</p><p>These levers, of course, fall more into the camp of <i>how</i> to go about finding PMF, which is not the focus of this essay.

(You’ll notice how the curve starts to inflect right around this timeframe in the chart below, taken from the company’s April 2018 board deck.)</p><p>Here’s how Looker checked each box on our list of the three dimensions at this time:</p><div><ul><li><p><b>Demand</b>: Went from 450 to nearly 800 customers in a year, growing revenue from $11.5M to $27M and increasing ACV to $57.7K.</p></li><li><p><b>Satisfaction</b>: Extremely happy customers, with 141% NRR, an 18 month-streak of net negative churn and renewals higher than plan.</p></li><li><p><b>Efficient</b>: The company had built an efficient model, with 77.6% gross margin.</p></li></ul></div><figure><img alt="" _uid="i-4a70c47a-24d4-4f50-acc2-c6538c03f67e" loading="eager" width="1" height="1" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2Fc6346371a7%2Flookers-path-to-pmf.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=90 640w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2Fc6346371a7%2Flookers-path-to-pmf.png&amp;w=750&amp;q=90 750w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2Fc6346371a7%2Flookers-path-to-pmf.png&amp;w=828&amp;q=90 828w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2Fc6346371a7%2Flookers-path-to-pmf.png&amp;w=1080&amp;q=90 1080w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2Fc6346371a7%2Flookers-path-to-pmf.png&amp;w=1200&amp;q=90 1200w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2Fc6346371a7%2Flookers-path-to-pmf.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=90 1920w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2Fc6346371a7%2Flookers-path-to-pmf.png&amp;w=2048&amp;q=90 2048w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2Fc6346371a7%2Flookers-path-to-pmf.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=90 3840w" src="https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2Fc6346371a7%2Flookers-path-to-pmf.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=90"></figure><figure><img alt="" _uid="i-328abc92-8959-4f89-bad1-377effe0eb7b" loading="eager" width="1" height="1" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2F35187b3042%2Flooker-board-graph-2018.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=90 640w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2F35187b3042%2Flooker-board-graph-2018.png&amp;w=750&amp;q=90 750w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2F35187b3042%2Flooker-board-graph-2018.png&amp;w=828&amp;q=90 828w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2F35187b3042%2Flooker-board-graph-2018.png&amp;w=1080&amp;q=90 1080w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2F35187b3042%2Flooker-board-graph-2018.png&amp;w=1200&amp;q=90 1200w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2F35187b3042%2Flooker-board-graph-2018.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=90 1920w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2F35187b3042%2Flooker-board-graph-2018.png&amp;w=2048&amp;q=90 2048w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2F35187b3042%2Flooker-board-graph-2018.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=90 3840w" src="https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2F35187b3042%2Flooker-board-graph-2018.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=90"></figure><p>Looker’s path is a great example of each dimension coming together to contribute to extreme product-market fit (and we’ll be sharing more of it in the pages below). But just as there are success stories like these, <b>in our experience, the absence of one or more of these dimensions is also the biggest reason that startups fail</b>.</p><h3>We believe that if you think about PMF in these terms, you'll be more likely to end up at strong or extreme levels of PMF than all the companies that didn't make it — in part because you and your co-founders will have a shared framework to more precisely diagnose where you might be falling short.</h3><p>To help your startup achieve that feat, we’ll dive into each of these levels and unpack them with more detail. In the sections that follow, we’ll walk you through what it feels like to be at each one, the most important thing to focus on, and thought starters from fellow founders on what you might try to level up.</p><p>In addition to benchmarks based on data we’ve gathered and insights from established B2B founders who are where you want to be, we’ve also drawn from the hundreds of companies we’ve worked with to create composite case studies of fictitious startups that bring each level to life. We’ll also return to our example of how Looker actually progressed through every level and eventually reached extreme product-market fit.</p></div></section><div id="level-1-nascent"><div><figure><figcaption><span>WATCH (7 MIN)</span><span>•</span><span>JASON BOEHMIG ON IRONCLAD’S PATH TO PMF</span></figcaption></figure><div><p><span>A</span>t this stage, a founder’s primary job is to find a problem worth solving for three to five customers. And by problem we mean an issue that is urgent and important for them, where solving it would be immensely valuable for their business. With that in sight, it’s time to build a product that solves the problem and delivers high satisfaction for those customers. You may need to iterate across our 4Ps (persona, problem, promise, product) a few times to land on the right combination.</p><p>And while it’s not the primary focus of Level 1, you should also be thinking about demand here, exploring whether you’ll be able to find enough customers with that problem who will need your product. While efficiency isn't something to spend much time on yet, we’d recommend trying to start constructing a credible argument in your head about how the business could eventually scale efficiently.&nbsp;</p><p>In our experience, we’ve found that a fairly high percentage of startups get stuck at Level 1 — and stay stuck for six, 12, or even 18 months. That's when we’ve seen founders get bogged down in “the grind.”&nbsp;</p><p><b>That’s because the hallmark of this level is that it lacks repeatability — that’s to be expected at Level 1. </b>Finding the marginal customer is the opposite of easy. <b>At this point, you’re not entirely clear on what a customer needs to look like in order to be the right fit for what you’re building</b>. And even when you land on a rough hypothesis, acquisition is usually unscalable. Then when you do get in front of a prospect, your messages don’t always land — some customers immediately “get it,” while for others it doesn’t resonate.&nbsp;</p><p>Each customer’s needs (and thus the solutions that you build) are slightly different. Some come in asking for a slew of additional features and functionality to meet their requirements, while others see an immediate impact even with an early version of the product.&nbsp;</p><h4><p>What is Feels Like</p></h4><p>As we talked to sales-led B2B founders about how they navigated this first phase, unsurprisingly, several different paths emerged. Some grappled with finding the right product, others struggled to identify the target user, still others doubted the size of the market or even abandoned their original idea entirely.</p><p>The common thread was wasted cycles before they stumbled upon those first few sparks of traction — which were more in the vein of “aha moments” or “this might just work” inklings, rather than hard metrics and the beginning of a hockey stick growth curve.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are three specific examples from Ironclad, Verkada and Plaid on what that early traction felt like (after a winding path to getting there):</p><h4><p>Ironclad: Unlocking a more specific product by visiting customers IRL</p></h4><p><b>Ironclad</b> is now a well-known digital contracting platform (last valued at $3.2B), but unpacking their journey to nascent product-market fit highlights just how much manual, non-scalable work you’ll find at this level.&nbsp;</p><p>After serving as outside counsel for startups, co-founder <b>Jason Boehmig </b>started tinkering with automating parts of his own practice with coding that he had taught himself along the way. After realizing that there was a gap both in new solutions for lawyers and a team that understood how they actually used software products, he decided to leave his law firm life behind.</p><p>“It’s wild to think back to this now that we're in the AI assistant boom because the first version of Ironclad was an automated assistant for legal paperwork — but it was really me on the backend of an email address,” Boehmig says.&nbsp;</p><p>“We started by doing everything from corporate filings to NDAs and everything in between. So if you were doing an NDA, you would CC <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cai-gogwilt/">admin@ironclad.ai</a> and be like, ‘Hey, I'm doing an NDA with Joe Smith. Can you help us get it done?’ And I would send a series of responses as the Ironclad AI such as, ‘Hey, I need the following information,’ or ‘Here's the template. I filled it in.’ I later met my co-founder, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cai-gogwilt/"><u>Cai</u></a>, who was an amazing engineer, and he’d watch me work as the assistant and then would automate what could be automated away.”</p><p>But it was spending time in person with their initial customers that helped narrow their product’s focus. “I remember that we flew out the whole company — which was four or five people at the time —to Boulder to see a customer who had a bunch of product feedback for us. We all just sat around and watched them use the product,” Boehmig says.&nbsp;</p><p>“They had two monitors, one showing their email and on the other was Ironclad. They were just doing their day-to-day routine, working on a legal team. And by observing them and seeing how important these routine, repeatable transactions were to their profession, we realized we had to go all in on these corporate legal teams — particularly legal operations, which was a role that was just getting defined back in 2015.”</p></div></div><div><blockquote>"<!-- -->At Ironclad, the early ‘aha moments’ came from watching our customers use the product. It enabled us to pick a niche audience that we could go after — legal operations — and the specific task they were doing — routine transactions.<!-- -->"</blockquote></div><div><figure><figcaption><span>WATCH (7 MIN)</span><span>•</span><span>FILIP KALISZAN ON VERKADA’S PATH TO PMF</span></figcaption></figure><div><h4>Verkada: Going unreasonably deep and moving fast to wow customers</h4><p><b>Verkada </b>has six different physical security product lines today, but the founders started back in 2016 with video security. Inspired by IoT devices in the consumer space, they realized the enterprise equivalent of applying software to video security was missing. When co-founder <b>Filip Kaliszan </b>thinks back to the nascent stage of their journey to PMF, the team’s speed and willingness to get in the field stand out.&nbsp;</p><p>“The very first version looked very funny. It was a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Pi-Camera-Module-Megapixel/dp/B01ER2SKFS"><u>Raspberry Pi</u></a> based camera. We just hacked it together from different parts — the supply chain was <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Pi-Camera-Module-Megapixel/dp/B01ER2SKFS">Amazon.com</a>, We built maybe 100 of these little cameras and we gave them to friends and businesses we knew,” says Kaliszan. “The whole idea was to just learn what it takes to build the software and build out the solution. The prototype was just about learning if the technology would work and convincing ourselves that there was a there there.”</p><p>What struck us about Verkada’s approach here was how hands on it was — and how quickly they moved to extract those insights. “<b>For the first few customers, we just did whatever it took to get the customer deployed as fast as possible and then stayed close to that customer to learn what was working for them and what wasn’t</b>. That approach has been extremely informative in shaping everything we build in our products,” he says.</p><p>Take this example: “We were very aggressive with sending trial units. The moment we had a positive signal from the customer, we would get them a camera. We made sure that the process was seamless, fast, and easy from the very beginning. If you talked to us today, 24 hours later you’d have a nice box of kit to try it out,” Kaliszan says.</p><p>“We were also going on site and doing a lot of installs for customers. This is before we had a partner ecosystem, before we had installers who wanted to work with us. I remember flying to L.A. to install cameras at the Beverly Hills Equinox, one of our early customers. The gym closed at midnight, and we had until 5:00 AM to get the cameras installed. So I'm buying some drills, getting up on a ladder and pulling cables myself. We were making sure whatever needed to get done got done so that the product worked.”</p><p>That commitment paid off. “We spent two years building, so 2018 was our first year of sales. In the first couple of months of that year, we got enough pull and demand on the camera front where it was that validation ‘aha’ moment,” Kaliszan says. “We sort of always thought the idea was cool, but that was that moment that really crystallized that what we had built was beginning to work for the customers.”</p></div></div><div><blockquote>"<!-- -->When you have any signs of early demand pull, you have to follow it and work as hard as it takes to just make it happen.&nbsp;<!-- -->"</blockquote><p><span><span>Filip Kaliszan</span><span><span>•</span> <!-- -->Verkada</span></span></p></div><div><figure><figcaption><span>WATCH (7 MIN)</span><span>•</span><span>ZACH PERRET ON PLAID’S PATH TO PMF</span></figcaption></figure><div><h4>Plaid: Pivoting and building conviction in an unproven market</h4><p>But even with early customer traction, it can still feel like a slog. <b>Plaid </b>is now known as the pioneer of the “invisible plumbing” fintech infrastructure that powers everything from paying your friends back on Venmo, to making an investment on Robinhood, to buying Bitcoin on Coinbase. But the product actually started out as a consumer budgeting app.&nbsp;</p><p>“The response of consumers was such that we pretty quickly realized we weren't going to be any good at building budgeting apps. We tried for a while. We built six different versions of budgeting management, analyzing your spend types of applications and they didn't really ever get any traction,” says co-founder <b>Zach Perret.</b></p><p>“One day, a friend who was one of the early engineers at Venmo came to us and said, ‘Hey, your consumer products are not so good, but I'd like to license the backend that you've built, the way that you've integrated with the banks in order to get the data into your app.’ It took awhile, but eventually we decided to make this pivot and shift over to building the platform,” he says.</p><p>“We then had five or seven people who said that they would probably use the product if we built it. We even had one who said they would <i>pay us</i> if we built it. And so it was pretty easy to find nascent product-market fit in that very early stage once we landed on the right idea,” says Perret.</p><p>“The bigger challenge for Plaid was that the market didn't really exist. So while we had these five or seven companies that wanted us to build something, the real challenge was market development. That was the reason that almost every VC passed on investing in Plaid in the early stages. They said, ‘You've built an interesting product, it could be useful for some customers, but the market's not very big.’”&nbsp;</p></div></div><div><blockquote>"<!-- -->When I think back to the earliest stage of Plaid’s product-market fit journey, the challenge wasn't finding a product that people would buy. It was creating a market around the product that we believed would be very important for the future, but was yet to be proven.<!-- -->"</blockquote><p><span><span>Zach Perret</span><span><span>•</span> <!-- --> Plaid</span></span></p></div><p>“Convincing ourselves and everyone else that there was a real market here — that financial services space would eventually have startups in it — that was the hardest thing we had to do in the earliest phase,” says Perret.</p><h4><p>What it Looks Like: A Case Study on Nascent Demand, Satisfaction, Efficiency in Action</p></h4><p>To return to the very beginning of our example from Looker’s actual trajectory, the data platform startup spent roughly from August 2011 to March 2013 in the nascent stage. “We waited almost a year to raise money, until we knew it was a venture business — not every startup is, and you don’t want to get locked in. We were cranking along with customers and revenue. And it wasn’t all nailed down, but we had figured out enough of how go-to-market might work to know that it was workable,” says <!-- -->Looker co-founder Lloyd Tabb.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s how the business looked at the nascent stage: With that early glimmer of traction, Looker raised a $2 million seed round from First Round and PivotNorth in August 2012. By the end of Q1 of 2013, the 9-person team was at $357K in ARR with 15 customers. (Incidentally, f<!-- -->ive of Looker’s first six<!-- --> customers were First Round companies.) Outside of warm intros, one tactic the team found effective early on was customer events. “We started doing ‘Look&amp;Tell’ customer events super early on compared to other startups. I remember sweating and dragging cases of beer down Market Street to get to an event we were hosting — I think we probably had about eight attendees, but we kept at it and they paid off eventually,” says Tabb’s co-founder Ben Porterfield.</p><p>But to show an even more detailed snapshot of what “good” looks like at this level, we present a case study on our first fictitious startup: Ledgerly, a platform that uses LLMs to help accounting teams — complete with very detailed qualitative descriptions and metrics.&nbsp;</p><p>The Ledgerly team is pretty new, with just five full-time employees. They raised a $1.2 million pre-seed round earlier this year and they don't even know what their burn multiple is — but that’s appropriate, given how early they are.</p><figure><img alt="" _uid="i-f39dc879-d5c6-414e-907a-4f767ef731e2" loading="eager" width="1" height="1" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2F073c067071%2Fledgerly.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=90 640w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2F073c067071%2Fledgerly.png&amp;w=750&amp;q=90 750w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2F073c067071%2Fledgerly.png&amp;w=828&amp;q=90 828w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2F073c067071%2Fledgerly.png&amp;w=1080&amp;q=90 1080w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2F073c067071%2Fledgerly.png&amp;w=1200&amp;q=90 1200w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2F073c067071%2Fledgerly.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=90 1920w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2F073c067071%2Fledgerly.png&amp;w=2048&amp;q=90 2048w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2F073c067071%2Fledgerly.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=90 3840w" src="https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2F073c067071%2Fledgerly.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=90"></figure><div><p>Let’s walk through each of the dimensions of product-market fit:</p><ul><li><p><b>Demand</b>: They only have four customers, all of which they acquired through warm intros from their personal networks or from investors. They don't have an outbound sales machine yet. Three of those customers are paying $15K each, putting them at $45K ARR. (The fourth one is a design partner and isn’t paying yet.) But what you don’t see in these stats is that they actually had to connect with <i>46 different companies</i> to land these four customers. That’s fairly typical. In the early stages, you're going to talk to a ton of different prospects as you try to figure out the following: who are the customers that are right for you, and who are the customers with a problem that you can solve with a single product. The Ledgerly team doesn’t have any renewals yet since they're so early that none of their customers have hit the one-year mark. They did have one design partner churn due to lack of fit, but they don't consider that regretted churn.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><b>Satisfaction</b>: All of their customers are starting to use the product regularly, at least once a week. Two of them have onboarded multiple users internally. Ledgerly is getting good feedback from the three customers they’ve asked, so they’re starting to see signs of satisfaction, but it's early and anecdotal at this point.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><b>Efficiency: </b>This is the area the team has paid the least attention to, which is appropriate given their stage. Customer onboarding feels too lengthy (currently at eight weeks) and it takes them a lot of time to find qualified leads for new customers (at least five meetings to just find one prospective — not even signed — customer).

In the case of our fictitious startup, Ledgerly, in order to move the needle on satisfaction, their goal is to increase daily use and number of users at each company and start sending NPS surveys as a regular part of customer interactions. But don’t focus solely on these satisfaction metrics here — <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://review.firstround.com/mastering-the-art-of-the-outcome-how-guru-turned-customer-success-into-a-company-cornerstone/"><u>staying outcome-oriented</u></a> is key. This simple rule of thumb is a great reminder: Are you moving the business outcome you promised to move for your customer, and by how much?&nbsp;</p><p>With satisfaction front and center, demand is second at this stage. While you don't need heaps of customers, you do need an inkling that if you make this small set of customers happy, eventually there will be that proverbial line out the door. For Ledgerly, this means setting a target of landing two or three more customers in the next few months.</p><p>Efficiency comes in last at this stage. We’d recommend that you don't spend a ton of time thinking about it at Level 1. For Ledgerly, its planned optimizations are in service of improving satisfaction and demand. Their goal is to trim customer onboarding down to four weeks and create a faster, more repeatable sales process to improve conversion.</p></div></div><h3>To reach developing product-market fit, you have to build something that at least a handful of customers really, really need. It solves a problem for them. They can't live without it. And that requires earning a very high level of satisfaction first.</h3><div><figure><figcaption><span>WATCH (5 MIN)</span><span>•</span><span>LLOYD TABB ON LOOKER’S PATH TO PMF</span></figcaption></figure><div><p>Sticking close to your customers early on is key to cultivating that satisfaction. But there’s an important distinction here. “If you're not giving them value, they don't want to be near you,” says <b>Looker</b>’s <b>Lloyd Tabb</b>. “How many surveys do you get as a customer yourself? I just went and had my car repaired and I got a survey, which isn’t going to give me any value. You need to bring them something of value — otherwise you’re just annoying them,” he says.&nbsp;</p><p>“For Looker, the search for product-market fit was about figuring out how to deliver the value. For our first four customers, I had different ways of delivering what I was building, from pure consulting to a standalone product. But the problem with just giving someone the software was that they didn't get as much value out of it. I realized I needed to be teaching how to do data as well as delivering a product,” says Tabb.&nbsp;</p><p>“What worked best was part product, part service. We used the demo as a chance to build a proof of concept, so we didn’t have a dummy sales pitch version — we always asked the prospect for an actual dataset to play with. Then it was a very quick forward-deploy. We would come in and do a free trial where we would set up the software and teach them how to use it. And then we would watch for engagement,” he says. “Only when there was engagement would we close the deal. We had almost no early churn because we only sold customers who got the value out of it.”&nbsp;</p><p>As we’ve noted, inefficiency is expected at Level 1. “The downside was that some of the trials ran a <i>really</i> long time. If we didn’t see that momentum, I’d go back in and be more hands-on to make sure they understood how we could answer all of their data questions,” he says.</p></div></div><div><blockquote>"<!-- -->I had no qualms about sinking a disproportionate amount of resources here.

It’s a common trap at this stage to have customers who <i>like</i> but don't <i>love or need</i> your product. I use the relationship analogy a lot internally at Persona: <b>knowing when someone likes but doesn’t love something is very, very difficult but if you’ve ever been in the friend zone, you know that answer</b>,” he says.&nbsp;</p><p>To figure out if he was being “friend-zoned” in the early years of Persona, Song sought to build trusted relationships with a handful of his early customers. He talked to them all the time, texted them, grabbed coffee with them, and made sure he was very candid and self-deprecating to get that real feedback. Song would ask questions like the ones below over and over until he got strong enough answers that convinced him they were on the right track:</p><div><ul><li><p>If a competitor came along and charged you 50% less than what I'm charging you, would you switch?</p></li><li><p>If we increase the price, is that something that you're going to have a lot of pushback around?</p></li><li><p>Is Persona a game changer for your company?

We had seen at our last company that quarterly OKR planning was a painful process for companies. We validated that there was a real problem by talking to a bunch of other companies about how hard it is. The execs get mad at each other. The employees are like, why are we doing this? Nobody adheres. But while it was in fact a real problem, we never built software that truly solved that problem,” says Altman.</p><p>“There were two things that made that clear. One, it was really hard to get people to actually pull out their credit cards and pay us. And so a lot of CEOs and people leaders were saying, ‘We'd really like this. We want to manage our OKRs better. We're doing this in spreadsheets currently, it's not great. Can we try it? Can we test it for a quarter? Can we do a monthly thing? Can you give me a login so I can poke around?’ But when we tried to get them to pay, it was very challenging,” says Altman.</p><p>“The second issue was that once we did get people into the product — even entire teams where the whole company would do an OKR planning cycle in Lattice — the next quarter didn't come easily. They were like, ‘Ugh, we’ve got to do this.’ And then by the third quarter they were like, ‘This is not happening naturally.’ For the employees, the retention was just not there. So both sides were not strong enough,” he says.</p><p>His advice on how to get unstuck rang true for us: “<b>If you’re stuck, your only way out of the nascent stage is big changes, not small changes</b>. A lot of people hang out in nascent and make small changes for years, and that's just a literal waste of everybody's time and resources. Moving up levels of product-market fit or getting unstuck requires more than just incremental steps or giving it more time,” he says.</p><p>“You need to remind people of that reality so they don't stay in these loops for too long and instead say, ‘Alright, we're going to just move on and wholesale try a new thing.’ After nine or 10 months of working on OKRs, we got to a place where there wasn’t any line we could draw between what was happening and a business that was going to make any sense for the next round of funding by the time we ran out of money. So we ended up needing to pivot a couple of times before we landed on the thing that really worked, which was performance management.”</p></div></div><div><blockquote>"<!-- -->More often than not, if you're working on something that is not getting great traction, you’re probably not a 10% adjustment away — you’re probably a 200% adjustment away.<!-- -->"</blockquote><p><span><span>JACK ALTMAN</span><span><span>•</span> <!-- -->LATTICE</span></span></p></div><p><i>For more on how to make the right adjustments that will get you unstuck and out of nascent product-market fit, </i><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://first-round-website.vercel.app/apply"><i>apply to join PMF Method.</i></a></p></div><div id="level-2-developing"><div><figure><img alt="" loading="eager" width="1" height="1" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 90vw, 50vw" srcset="https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F700x410%2Fcf9fdbbe67%2F7.svg&amp;w=384&amp;q=90 384w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F700x410%2Fcf9fdbbe67%2F7.svg&amp;w=640&amp;q=90 640w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F700x410%2Fcf9fdbbe67%2F7.svg&amp;w=750&amp;q=90 750w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F700x410%2Fcf9fdbbe67%2F7.svg&amp;w=828&amp;q=90 828w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F700x410%2Fcf9fdbbe67%2F7.svg&amp;w=1080&amp;q=90 1080w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F700x410%2Fcf9fdbbe67%2F7.svg&amp;w=1200&amp;q=90 1200w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F700x410%2Fcf9fdbbe67%2F7.svg&amp;w=1920&amp;q=90 1920w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F700x410%2Fcf9fdbbe67%2F7.svg&amp;w=2048&amp;q=90 2048w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F700x410%2Fcf9fdbbe67%2F7.svg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=90 3840w" src="https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F700x410%2Fcf9fdbbe67%2F7.svg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=90"></figure><div><p><span>B</span>y Level 2, you’ve ticked through some of the classic milestones, such as building something 20 or so customers need, or getting to your first $1M in ARR.

For co-founder Lloyd Tabb, this was the stage when he knew they were onto something. “By the time we had 20 customers, I knew it was going to be big,” he says.&nbsp;</p><p>By August 2013, they’d made enough progress to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/08/13/business-intelligence-startup-looker-raises-16m-from-redpoint-first-round/"><u>raise</u></a> a $16M Series A round. By November 2013, they’d hit the coveted $1M in ARR milestone and grown to over 40 customers. New channels outside of warm intros were proving successful, from outbound and sales prospecting with two SDRs, to the potential of partner marketing with AWS Redshift and Snowplow. At this stage, that repeatability was starting to peek through. The Looker team had a better sense of who they were selling to (<!-- -->see their ICP from their Jan 2014 board deck below<!-- -->), having recently closed clients like Thumbtack, The RealReal, and Gilt. They were interested in going upmarket, and although they landed their first enterprise logos in April 2014 (eBay’s Venmo and NYTimes’ Baseline), for the most part, enterprise remained “elusive” at this level.</p><figure><img alt="" _uid="i-1effe912-48af-4ac0-b429-9a435fbd18fa" loading="eager" width="1" height="1" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2F64c45407d3%2Flookers-icp-2014.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=90 640w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2F64c45407d3%2Flookers-icp-2014.png&amp;w=750&amp;q=90 750w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2F64c45407d3%2Flookers-icp-2014.png&amp;w=828&amp;q=90 828w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2F64c45407d3%2Flookers-icp-2014.png&amp;w=1080&amp;q=90 1080w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2F64c45407d3%2Flookers-icp-2014.png&amp;w=1200&amp;q=90 1200w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2F64c45407d3%2Flookers-icp-2014.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=90 1920w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2F64c45407d3%2Flookers-icp-2014.png&amp;w=2048&amp;q=90 2048w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2F64c45407d3%2Flookers-icp-2014.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=90 3840w" src="https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2F64c45407d3%2Flookers-icp-2014.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=90"></figure><p>By July 2013, there was an average of 1600+ hours spent per month by customers in Looker. As the team put it in a board update, they continued to see amazing satisfaction by “maintaining insane referenceability and minimal churn (3).” As for efficiency, by the end of 2013, their CAC was $54,000 with a payback period of 19 months. At this time they noted that from first meeting to close ranged from two to seven months, with three months as the average. Customizations were still cropping up, as white-labeling and self-service had unique requirements. While sales process improvements were underway, their unique forward-deploy trials were still taking 30-40 hours, which needed to be brought down.</p><p>As for our example company at this level, meet Hire Hero, a fictional interviewing platform that uses AI to help teams hire better.

Their average sales cycle is 32 days, but that's an improvement over 47 days. One promising sign is that their most recent five customers are paying twice as much as what their early customers paid. Increasing ACV is a very strong sign on the demand side.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><b>Satisfaction</b>: This team has been around long enough to actually track renewals, and four of their customers have renewed. After selling for more than 12 months, four customers have churned, which isn’t ideal, but two of those were non-regretted. This is pretty typical. As the product direction changes, you’ll often realize that certain early customers are just not the right fit anymore. Additionally, weekly active usage is going up. The team is running classic NPS style surveys and getting roughly half nines and tens.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><b>Efficiency: </b>At this stage, it’s still not a focus, but at least they know they're at 65% gross margin. Software companies should be shooting for 75-80%+ when it comes to gross margin, so something to improve on. Their onboarding has gotten 15% faster. And very critically, fewer customizations are being asked for by each of their customers, meaning they’re able to sell the same product to now 22 customers.</p></li></ul></div><h4><p>Benchmarks:</p></h4><div><p>These are the benchmarks that we would consider very typical of Level 2:</p><ul><li><p>Team size: Up to 20 people.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>You're either a Seed or Series A company.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Demand source: Early signs of a scalable channel that doesn't depend on warm intros from your VCs or your friends.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Without a warm intro, your first call to closed-won percentage is approaching 10%.</p></li><li><p>“Magic Number” (ARR/CAC) in the .5 to .75 range.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>5-25 customers.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>$500K to $5M ARR.</p></li><li><p>Some renewals, 10-20% regretted churn, NRR at least 100%.</p></li><li><p>Not less than 50% gross margin.</p></li><li><p>Not worse than 5X burn multiple.</p></li></ul></div><figure><img alt="" _uid="i-9b94e3e7-5225-41f1-91cb-29d2380cab38" loading="eager" width="1" height="1" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2Fdedd54ef8b%2Fdeveloping-pmf.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=90 640w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2Fdedd54ef8b%2Fdeveloping-pmf.png&amp;w=750&amp;q=90 750w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2Fdedd54ef8b%2Fdeveloping-pmf.png&amp;w=828&amp;q=90 828w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2Fdedd54ef8b%2Fdeveloping-pmf.png&amp;w=1080&amp;q=90 1080w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2Fdedd54ef8b%2Fdeveloping-pmf.png&amp;w=1200&amp;q=90 1200w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2Fdedd54ef8b%2Fdeveloping-pmf.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=90 1920w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2Fdedd54ef8b%2Fdeveloping-pmf.png&amp;w=2048&amp;q=90 2048w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2Fdedd54ef8b%2Fdeveloping-pmf.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=90 3840w" src="https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2Fdedd54ef8b%2Fdeveloping-pmf.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=90"></figure><div><figure><figcaption><span>WATCH (8 MIN)</span><span>•</span><span>CHRISTINA CACIOPPO ON VANTA’S PATH TO PMF</span></figcaption></figure><div><h4>What Matters Most:</h4><p>To level up, your priority needs to shift to demand. Here’s why: <b>We’ve seen true grind-it-out founders muscle their way to 20 customers through sheer willpower and effort. But you can’t will your way to 100 or 200 customers — </b>the satisfaction and demand for the product are starting to do the work for you.</p><p>Startups need to find a way to effectively drive demand. But in addition to working on lengthening those lines out the door, you still have to maintain the satisfaction bar that you’ve reached. And while efficiency <i>still</i> isn't the primary concern, it’s something that you’ll need to pay more and more attention to. Now is the time to start thinking about if this is going to be an efficient business, and starting to do the work to make it one.</p><p>The most helpful levers for pushing on demand are typically fine-tuning your product positioning and finding scalable channels, whether that’s outbound sales or SEO, paid marketing, or referrals.&nbsp;</p><p>For <b>Vanta</b>’s <b>Christina Cacioppo</b>, the latter is an area she would revisit with a time machine. “There was this kind of tight call-and-response where someone in a First Round community Slack channel or a YC forum would say ‘SOC 2’ and someone else would say ‘Vanta,’” she says. “We were so proud of ourselves with our brilliant guerilla marketing or whatever we thought we were doing, but I think what actually happened is we really underinvested in learning how to explain what we were building, outside of ‘Vanta gets you SOC 2, and that's important for your business.’ In retrospect, we should have started on some of that earlier versus coasting on what was initially great word of mouth.”</p></div></div><div><blockquote>"<!-- -->Word of mouth is wonderful, but in B2B you also need to scale ways you're acquiring customers. You need to start on that work earlier than you think.&nbsp;<!-- -->"</blockquote><p><span><span>Christina Cacioppo</span><span><span>•</span> <!-- -->Vanta</span></span></p></div><h4>Yellow Flags to Watch Out for:</h4><div><p>If you’re still unsure of whether your business can be classified as developing product-market fit, here are the yellow flags we recommend watching out for:</p><ul><li><p>Current customers are happy, but you're having trouble opening the floodgates.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Regretted churn is greater than 20%. People bought your product and paid for it and just weren't happy — and one out of five of them is churning off.</p></li><li><p>Starting to get concerned about your burn multiple, e.g. you're burning $200K per month and only bringing in $20K net new ARR per month, which would put you at a less-than-stellar burn multiple of 10. (You’re aiming for as close to 1 as possible, or even below 1). But you feel like if you stop spending the money you're just going to stop growing.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Sales cycle is taking too long and you lose deals late in the funnel. You start to lose to competitors. And you're just not feeling the urgency from potential customers.</p></li><li><p>You're struggling to hit the price point that you want. This is often a signal that customers see your product as a nice-to-have versus a must-have. You often hear “we don't have the budget,” or “it's not the right time for us,” in conversations.</p></li></ul></div><figure><img alt="" _uid="i-f6cda70e-b678-42cc-97af-91bb41a4e87f" loading="eager" width="1" height="1" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2Fbed5a64cda%2Fstuck-level-2.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=90 640w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2Fbed5a64cda%2Fstuck-level-2.png&amp;w=750&amp;q=90 750w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2Fbed5a64cda%2Fstuck-level-2.png&amp;w=828&amp;q=90 828w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2Fbed5a64cda%2Fstuck-level-2.png&amp;w=1080&amp;q=90 1080w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2Fbed5a64cda%2Fstuck-level-2.png&amp;w=1200&amp;q=90 1200w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2Fbed5a64cda%2Fstuck-level-2.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=90 1920w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2Fbed5a64cda%2Fstuck-level-2.png&amp;w=2048&amp;q=90 2048w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2Fbed5a64cda%2Fstuck-level-2.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=90 3840w" src="https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2Fbed5a64cda%2Fstuck-level-2.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=90"></figure><p><i>For more on how to get your sales machine firing on all cylinders to propel your company out of developing product-market fit, apply to join </i><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://first-round-website.vercel.app/apply"><i>PMF Method</i></a><i>.</i></p></div><div id="level-3-strong"><div><figure><img alt="" loading="eager" width="1" height="1" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 90vw, 50vw" srcset="https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F700x410%2Ff8d46b0861%2F8.svg&amp;w=384&amp;q=90 384w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F700x410%2Ff8d46b0861%2F8.svg&amp;w=640&amp;q=90 640w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F700x410%2Ff8d46b0861%2F8.svg&amp;w=750&amp;q=90 750w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F700x410%2Ff8d46b0861%2F8.svg&amp;w=828&amp;q=90 828w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F700x410%2Ff8d46b0861%2F8.svg&amp;w=1080&amp;q=90 1080w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F700x410%2Ff8d46b0861%2F8.svg&amp;w=1200&amp;q=90 1200w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F700x410%2Ff8d46b0861%2F8.svg&amp;w=1920&amp;q=90 1920w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F700x410%2Ff8d46b0861%2F8.svg&amp;w=2048&amp;q=90 2048w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F700x410%2Ff8d46b0861%2F8.svg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=90 3840w" src="https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F700x410%2Ff8d46b0861%2F8.svg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=90"></figure><div><p>In our experience, the majority of startups never get to this level. If you get to strong product-market fit, your company has the potential to be very valuable.&nbsp;</p><p>The big difference between Level 2 and Level 3 is that the demand floodgates have opened. There’s even more repeatability. Demand is coming inbound. People have heard of you. The company feels like it’s humming. You know who your customer is with much more specificity (for example, the head of security at a company with 250-1000 employees who’s already using a Palo Alto Networks product). Your costs to acquire them are still a little high, but you’ve found that (most of the time) you can engage them with a clear and consistent message that resonates. You’re able to deploy a solution with little customization that delivers a ton of value to the customer.</p><h4><p>What it Feels Like:</p></h4><p>This is the stage where most of those PMF analogies you’ve previously heard start to make sense — you start to really <i>feel</i> the effects of product-market fit.</p><p><b>David Hsu</b> from <b>Retool</b> put it this way: “We talked to someone who said that finding product-market fit was so visceral that you immediately felt it — like a geyser exploding. And we honestly never felt that in the first couple years. At Retool every early customer we got, whether that was number four or number 14, felt like the last customer we were ever going to find. It felt more like rolling the stone uphill. If you stop pushing, it'll start rolling back on you immediately. That's how it felt until we had a few million in ARR — that's when the boulder went down the other side, and we had to chase it to keep up.”&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s how Jack Altman from Lattice describes it: “The biggest shift was in the ease of getting leads. I remember thinking, ‘I don't even know where these leads are coming from.’ <!-- -->And more just kept<!-- --> showing up every month,” he says.</p><p>For Verkada’s Filip Kaliszan, the feeling was similar. “After our first year of sales in 2018, those next two years were crazy. We were barely keeping up with production. We had to scale all the systems. A lot of things had to happen in the span of the next 12-18 months in order to deliver on everything that customers were hoping the solution was going to do for them. That in itself was a very formative and tricky part of the journey.”</p><p>For Plaid’s Zach Perret, this level felt noticeably different. “2016 to 2017 is when we knew we had very strong product-market fit, and that was mostly because we just saw rapid growth of many of our customers,” he says.&nbsp;</p><p>“This is around when Robinhood and Coinbase started to take off, and we saw it in our numbers. One of the benefits of being a platform company is that you're able to install really early with a customer and then grow over time, and that scale is really, really lovely,” says Perret. “For example, we eventually branded a portion of the user signup flow within Venmo and other apps. And that minor branding actually drove a lot of demand for our product because people would see it and they would say, ‘Hey, this is a new financial services experience. I should call Plaid because Plaid helped build this one.’ And so we had this nice cycle of our customers doing well, driving demand back to us and then so on and so forth every time,” he says.</p><p>“But keep in mind, by this point it had been four or four and a half years since we started the company. And so a lot of the early journey was based on faith and belief that this market would exist, on good early signals that were partially real and partially manufactured by the work that we'd done.”</p><h4><p>What it Looks Like: A Case Study on Strong Demand, Satisfaction, Efficiency in Action</p></h4><p>Let’s start again by tracing back to when Looker fit into Level 3, roughly from November 2014 to December 2015. By November 2014, the team had passed the $5M ARR mark. CEO Frank Bien put it best in an email update to us: “<i>The general feeling is that lots of companies can make it to $1 or 2M ARR, but hitting 5M shows you’ve built something very real and sustainable. Also impressive is how quickly we hit this point.”</i></p><p>In February 2015, the company <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/11/looker-raises-another-30m-for-its-new-approach-to-business-intelligence/"><u>raised</u></a> a $30M Series B round, noting they’d grown to 110 employees, and increased revenue by 400%. At this point, Looker had 250 customers, adding new customers such as Uber, Instacart, Plaid, and Etsy. Continuing to open up new channels, the team closed its first reseller deal in Q2 2015 and started expanding into Europe, opening their first EMEA office in London. The team was focused on growing organic inbound through PR, community, content &amp; thought leadership, in addition to scaling their partnerships. For example, early in 2015 bringing on Segment and Snowflake was a big win, as was being selected as one of three top launch partners for Microsoft SQL DW &amp; Azure. However, a main focus during this period was fine-tuning their positioning, to better appeal both to data experts and general business users.&nbsp;</p><p>Customers experienced as much as 80-90% user adoption across an employee base. By the end of 2015, 97% of customers were accessing Looker at least once per day, CAC had decreased to $45,300 and payback period was down to 17.5 months. Gross margin improved from 62.5% in 2014 to 72.6% in 2015. The sales trial model continued to get more efficient, and the company had a 70% trial to win rate. But perhaps what was most impressive as efficiency shifted into the forefront was their planning accuracy: In seven years, the Looker team never missed a bookings plan, achieving a rare 28-quarter streak of pure execution.</p><p>For our Level 3 case study, let’s introduce GuardDog, a fictional incident management tool to help security teams seamlessly identify and address security issues. They have 64 full-time employees and are planning to raise a $25M Series B. Their burn multiple is now 2.1, which is getting respectable.</p></div></div><figure><img alt="" _uid="i-2f903094-ee23-442d-9d76-9b9f0a8912a9" loading="eager" width="1" height="1" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2Fb06dbf012f%2Fguarddog.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=90 640w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2Fb06dbf012f%2Fguarddog.png&amp;w=750&amp;q=90 750w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2Fb06dbf012f%2Fguarddog.png&amp;w=828&amp;q=90 828w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2Fb06dbf012f%2Fguarddog.png&amp;w=1080&amp;q=90 1080w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2Fb06dbf012f%2Fguarddog.png&amp;w=1200&amp;q=90 1200w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2Fb06dbf012f%2Fguarddog.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=90 1920w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2Fb06dbf012f%2Fguarddog.png&amp;w=2048&amp;q=90 2048w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2Fb06dbf012f%2Fguarddog.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=90 3840w" src="https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2Fb06dbf012f%2Fguarddog.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=90"></figure><div><p>Let’s walk through each of the dimensions of product-market fit:</p><ul><li><p><b>Demand: </b>GuardDog has 88 customers.

CAC payback, LTV to CAC ratio — these are all the metrics that really start to matter. (Specifically you want to see a CAC payback period under 18 months, and LTV/CAC greater than three.)</p><p>If you eventually want to be valued well in the public markets (which you’re probably starting to think about at Level 3), you have to become more efficient — while still sustaining satisfaction and demand. Focusing on refining your GTM motion (inside sales, outside sales, layering on channel partnerships) and figuring out broad awareness building is key here.</p><h3>The difference between strong and extreme product-market fit is that you have to successfully stay on that growth curve and make the whole operation more efficient at the same time. It’s a highwire act.</h3><h4>Yellow Flags to Watch Out for:</h4><p>What we’ve observed most at Level 3 is that this is when real competitors start to emerge — before you may have been flying a bit under the radar.

Here’s how he thought about balancing these competing interests: “After crunching the numbers, we saw that by the time we had 2,000 customers, we could be doing $100 million dollars in ARR, and on the path to going public. That was the model from 2013 on. And as a side note, we were pretty spot on — we were at 1,700 customers, so we actually did a little better than we predicted,” says Bien.</p><p>“Lloyd’s early sales intuition was right, you had to do a robust proof of concept. It reminded me of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.palantir.com/dev-versus-delta-demystifying-engineering-roles-at-palantir-ad44c2a6e87"><u>Palantir’s forward-deployed engineers</u></a>. We wanted to do an inside sales motion of that. Those salespeople had to be supported by an embedded technical person. But you have to know your model backwards and forwards to make a bet like that,” says Bien. “We knew the margins on the costs we were sinking into pre-sales support made sense. But if we had been unsure whether it was going to take 2,000 customers or 100,000 customers to reach the $100 million run rate, that would have been an incredibly risky move — we very easily could have been lighting our VC dollars on fire.”</p><p>“People often create models to drive valuation, they’re always trying to do 2x the plan. In my opinion, that’s the most dangerous, company-killing move you can make. We’ve never adjusted our plan based on any external investor influence or a valuation we were trying to achieve in an upcoming round. We did, of course, put our foot down on the pedal from time to time, but it was only when we saw opportunity in the business,” says Bien. “For example, when we first started trying to expand into enterprise, we were testing the waters. Once it started working, we invested more in our enterprise go-to-market efforts and bumped up our targets.”</p><p>Bien notes that when it comes to setting your plan, you want to maximize growth, but you also want it to still feel like a win. “It’s tempting to throw the plan numbers up much higher, and think that if you put the rabbit a little bit farther in front of the dog, it’ll run much faster. But that’s not how it works. It mostly just leaves you feeling like you’re treading water, which over the long run, actually slows you down,” he says. “We set our numbers according to our model, and we were ambitious, but not crazy — and in the end we got there faster.”</p><div><blockquote>"<!-- -->When it comes to setting your targets for the quarter, don’t stray too far from your model.

But we got good advice that you shouldn’t expand until you feel like you're pedaling at half speed, until you as the CEO are comfortable with all the progress that is being made in your core market,” says Rhodes.</p><p>“We made a pretty explicit choice to really focus on nailing things in our core market. It wasn’t until late 2019, so three years in, that we decided we were ready to go international and to go after apparel — we made the decision to do both simultaneously,” he says.</p><p>“There were a few boxes that I felt like we'd checked. One, we had the growth model figured out. I felt comfortable that growth was predictable and that we were just going to keep growing in the U.S., and that we built a big enough lead on domestic competition that we didn't need to figure out new things to accelerate our growth. We were more in optimization mode than really needing deep innovation,” says Rhodes.</p><p>“Second, we also had a leadership team in place for all the key functions. That felt stable. And I no longer felt like I was having to put out fires all day every day because this person was going to quit, or this problem popped up that we didn't know the answer to. My involvement in the day-to-day operations of all the functions no longer felt necessary. It felt like things were mostly working,” he says.&nbsp;</p><p>“And then the third thing is we had our unit economics figured out. I was no longer worried that we would run out of money if we kept growing. We had good payback periods. We were historically a very low margin business. We were negative contribution margin for the first two and a half years, but we'd finally cracked the code on getting to positive contribution. And so it felt like the systemic risks to the business, whether it was competition, hurting our growth, capital risk, or people execution issues, were in a solid place.”</p></div></div><div><blockquote>"<!-- -->Earlier in company building, you’re going uphill on a bike and pedaling as hard as you can.

Their burn multiple is looking very good at .87 — last month they brought in $2M of net-new ARR, and only burned $1.73M.</p><figure><img alt="" _uid="i-7ca9560f-7e78-4775-8470-30e196c3aff2" loading="eager" width="1" height="1" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2Ff9916964f1%2Fmetriq.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=90 640w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2Ff9916964f1%2Fmetriq.png&amp;w=750&amp;q=90 750w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2Ff9916964f1%2Fmetriq.png&amp;w=828&amp;q=90 828w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2Ff9916964f1%2Fmetriq.png&amp;w=1080&amp;q=90 1080w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2Ff9916964f1%2Fmetriq.png&amp;w=1200&amp;q=90 1200w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2Ff9916964f1%2Fmetriq.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=90 1920w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2Ff9916964f1%2Fmetriq.png&amp;w=2048&amp;q=90 2048w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2Ff9916964f1%2Fmetriq.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=90 3840w" src="https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2Ff9916964f1%2Fmetriq.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=90"></figure><div><p>Let’s walk through each of the dimensions of product-market fit:</p><ul><li><p><b>Demand: </b>They've got 262 customers.

Growing over a long period of time is actually the act of finding extreme PMF over and over again. The very best companies are forever focused on expanding TAM and re-finding PMF in new markets.</h3><p>In our experience, most founders struggle with the timing, and start thinking about expanding TAM too late. When you’re focused on getting the core business to fire on all cylinders, it’s hard to split your time. <b>Atlassian</b> stands out as an example to take inspiration from here — the company pursued this work much earlier than most.&nbsp;</p><p>“We created our second product, Confluence, in Atlassian’s second year, which is really unusual — especially when you’ve got a breakout product like Jira that’s growing really nicely. Conventional company-building wisdom would say not to do it — there’s still a ton of work you need to do on the first product, and it will fragment your focus once you start working on a second thing, which could be a death sentence for a young company,” says <b>Jay Simons</b>.</p><p>But not only did Confluence become a cornerstone of Atlassian’s product suite, Simons also spots plenty of less-tangible upsides. “We began to build this muscle around cross-merchandising, cross-selling, and upselling. How do you think about pricing and packaging around multiple things? How do you do product planning and prioritization and budgeting and staffing? <b>At a really early age at Atlassian, we began to wire our brain to think about all of those things that companies need to do as they get bigger</b>,” he says.</p><p>“It’s harder as you get bigger too, because the product you add actually needs to be bigger. For a company like Atlassian that has individual products that are hundreds of millions of ARR, a new thing that you add has got to grow pretty quickly, and it’s got to have a big market it can grow into,” he says.</p><p>Timing aside, the other hurdle is tackling the question of which path to take once you hit that inflection point of needing to grow your TAM. We like this framework from <b>Persona</b> founder <b>Rick Song</b>:</p><p><b>Once you’ve reached extreme product-market fit and are ready to attempt to do it all over again, you can effectively expand your TAM — which is how you compound revenue — by remixing one (and eventually all) of three components: your product, your market or your buyer.</b></p><div><p>That could look like:</p><ol><li><p>Creating new product use cases by adding new features and functionality.</p></li><li><p>Creating a net-new product that you sell in the same market to the same buyer.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Taking the same product and expanding into a different market (whether that’s a different sector or moving upmarket/downmarket).</p></li><li><p>Selling the same product in the same market to a different buyer.</p></li></ol></div><p>Over time, you will likely need to expand all of these. Let’s return to Atlassian. For simplicity’s sake, say Act I was JIRA (a single product) sold to an engineering leader (buyer) at companies between 10 to 100 people in size (market segment). <b>You can change any of those three elements —</b> <b>but in most cases, it’s best to do this serially</b>.</p><p>In our Atlassian example, say Act II was taking the same product and selling it to security leaders to manage all the security tickets (new buyer, same market segment). Say Act III was introducing Confluence (a new internal wiki product), in many cases sold to the same buyers and market segment.</p><p>Or consider how Salesforce sells into healthcare, financial services, and government. The product use case is relatively similar, the buyer may be different or the same, but the market segment is very different. Other times, the buyer remains relatively consistent but the product use cases change. In its most simplistic form, Amazon’s AWS has hundreds of use cases and SKUs sold into the same (or a similar) buyer.&nbsp;</p><p>As you can see, there are countless combinations to explore. But in our experience, when most founders think about building concentric circles around their core business, too often they concentrate on selling a new product use case into an existing buyer. It seems like a lower lift, in the sense that you already have the customer. And sometimes that's the correct thing to do — <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://squareup.com/us/en/press/square-capital"><u>Square expanding into lending</u></a> is a great example — but if that’s the only path you pursue, there will be a ceiling on your TAM.</p><p>What’s crucial is that for each one of these new bets, you need to get to strong and extreme product-market fit. In some cases, the journey is much shorter, given the work your company has already put into understanding a customer or developing a market. But in other cases, this requires starting at the very bottom of the ladder, moving through the levels of product-market fit all over again. In other words, a company might have extreme product-market fit with one product, buyer and segment, and perhaps only nascent product-market fit for another product with the same buyer and segment. That is the journey of building compounding revenue over years and then decades.</p><figure><img alt="" _uid="i-8fa783e5-2a08-4fd6-b2ff-33e2d3caf6a0" loading="eager" width="1" height="1" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2F4432459ef9%2Flayercake.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=90 640w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2F4432459ef9%2Flayercake.png&amp;w=750&amp;q=90 750w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2F4432459ef9%2Flayercake.png&amp;w=828&amp;q=90 828w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2F4432459ef9%2Flayercake.png&amp;w=1080&amp;q=90 1080w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2F4432459ef9%2Flayercake.png&amp;w=1200&amp;q=90 1200w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2F4432459ef9%2Flayercake.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=90 1920w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2F4432459ef9%2Flayercake.png&amp;w=2048&amp;q=90 2048w, https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2F4432459ef9%2Flayercake.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=90 3840w" src="https://pmf.firstround.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fa-us.storyblok.com%2Ff%2F1019508%2F2816x1536%2F4432459ef9%2Flayercake.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=90"></figure><h3>It’s like you’re assembling a layer cake over many many years. You’re adding on new features, new products, new customers, new market segments — trying to stack your way to a multi-billion dollar valuation without knocking the whole thing over. That’s been the recipe for every fantastic B2B company.</h3><p>That journey of climbing your way to extreme product-market fit only to have to move through the levels once more is certainly daunting — particularly when you remember how tough those early days without traction were. “As much as I now joke about Vanta’s early days and how confused we were with all of our different startup ideas, the truth is that period is really rough,” says Christina Cacioppo.&nbsp;</p><p>“From the outside, you can romanticize a founder’s life and think, ‘The world's your oyster. You can build whatever you want. You're going to start a company, it'll be great. You get to decide everything.’ And that's all true, but in the day-to-day, it's more like, ‘What am I doing? Does anyone care? Will anyone <i>ever</i> care?’ There’s so much in the early days where you can't tell if you’re doing it wrong. Having a group of other people going through a similar experience to talk about that with and normalize some of the uncertainty is really, really helpful. It can help you figure out if it’s an idea that you’re pulled toward because you’re just looking for something in all of the uncertainty, or if it’s actually viable.”&nbsp;</p><p>We’ve purpose-built PMF Method to solve those challenges. Building a company is lonely, but we’re firm believers that there’s no cure like working alongside a tight group of other top 1% B2B founders at your same stage. <a href="https://pmf.firstround.com/apply">Apply here to join them</a>.</p><p><i>This article was about what extreme PMF looks like, but in our program, we dive into the details of how you can get there — you can preview the other seven </i><a href="https://pmf.firstround.com/#sessions"><i>sessions you’d learn from in the program here</i></a><i>.</i></p></div></article></main></div></div>]]></description>

Apple's M3 processors provide 18 TOPS of NPU performance but obviously aren't impacted by Microsoft's requirements.&nbsp;</p><p>The ability to run AI workloads locally helps alleviate critical privacy concerns in the commercial space. It also delivers latency, performance, and battery life advantages for AI applications (power efficiency is dramatically better with the NPU than running the same AI workload on the GPU). However, unleashing that performance requires tightly coupled software solutions, and in many respects, the early war for AI dominance will come down to developer partnerships.</p><p>The AI ecosystem is still raw as developers work to leverage NPU acceleration in their products, but AMD, Microsoft, and others are working to build the foundations that will enable a broad swath of AI-accelerated features in software and Windows. AMD cites that it will have 150+ ISV (independent software vendor) partnerships to develop AI-driven solutions in 2024, in contrast to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-shares-new-ai-pc-definition-launches-ai-pc-acceleration-programs-and-core-ultra-meteor-lake-nuc-developer-kits-at-ai-conference" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-shares-new-ai-pc-definition-launches-ai-pc-acceleration-programs-and-core-ultra-meteor-lake-nuc-developer-kits-at-ai-conference">Intel's broadening AI Developer Program</a>, which has 100 ISV and 100+ IHV (integrated hardware vendor) partnerships thus far.</p><p>Naturally, unleashing the power of locally-run AI starts with the hardware.

AMD also shared benchmarks with a wider range of AI models, like facial and object recognition, among others. Claimed performance advantages range from 5% to 23% across a spate of more general CPU-centric applications.&nbsp;</p><p>The company also claims a 46% battery life advantage over the Intel Core Ultra 7 165H during a Teams workflow and a slight advantage over the Apple M3 Pro CPU.

You've got the real-life casino, the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/betmgm-ceo-sports-betting-online-gambling-strategy-competition-heats-up-2023-11" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">casino on your phone</a>, sports betting, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/crypto-market-cap-bubble-peak-bitcoin-ethereum-solana-2024-4" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">crypto</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meme-stocks-return-how-to-identify-2024-4" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">meme stocks</a> — even complex financial products like <a target="_blank" href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/what-are-zero-day-expiration-options-stock-market-risks-0dte-2023-9" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">zero-day options</a> can give you a quick hit of risk. For young men in particular, it's an enticing, if a bit troubling, prospect. But for a variety of companies, from sportsbooks to investing apps, an increased willingness to make some kind of gamble means business is booming. The boys-who-like-to-bet bank is open, and companies are making as many withdrawals as they can.</p><p>The level at which gambling has become normalized in the United States in recent years is stunning. Americans legally bet a record $119.84 billion on sports in 2023, up from $93 billion in 2022. Since the Supreme Court in 2018 struck down a federal law prohibiting sports gambling, more than three dozen states have embraced it in some form. Seven states have also legalized iGaming, meaning online blackjack, roulette, and slot machines.</p><p>And while not explicitly gambling, free trading apps such as Robinhood have gotten <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-investing-outlook-day-trading-risks-threats-peter-tchir-2020-9" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">an increasing number of ordinary people</a> into investing — for fun, to alleviate boredom, to try to make some extra cash. While many people have used the apps to build a stable portfolio, a good chunk of people are doing high-risk day trading or piling into meme stocks like GameStop, AMC, or, as Donald Trump's people are hoping, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-media-stock-price-crash-spac-djt-truth-social-2024-4" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">his newly public social-media company</a>. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-all-time-high-etfs-crypto-price-crash-boom-bust-2024-3" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Crypto is back again</a>, and this time around, almost nobody is pretending the endeavor is about anything other than "number go up." Many<a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/esrb-cracks-down-on-microtransactions-what-it-means-for-you-2018-2" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""> video games have a gambling-like aspect</a>, too, that gets kids and adolescents into the risk-minded pipeline.</p><!-- Excluded mobile ad on desktop --><p>While plenty of people across demographics are participating in these trends, data suggests the crowds skew younger and male. A 2023 survey from the NCAA found that <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sports-betting-apps-online-gambling-lottery-draftkings-fanduel-2024-3" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">sports gambling was prevalent</a> among young adults, specifically on college campuses and among Black and Latino respondents. Pew Research found in 2022 that men and people under 50 were likelier to bet on sports than women and the over-50 crowd. Younger men tend to be more into crypto and meme-stock trading as well.</p><p>This isn't surprising. Men tend to take more financial risks than women. As investors, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-men-and-women-invest-2015-2" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">they're more prone to overconfidence</a>, which often leads them to trade more — and, as a result, get lower returns. Men generally <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-sports-betting-fantasy-games-taking-over-college-campuses-2024-1" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">gamble more than women</a>, and they've been found to have lower levels of impulsive coping in gambling settings.</p><p>The precise reason for this behavior is hard to pin down, said Timothy Fong, a clinical professor of psychiatry at UCLA and the codirector of its gambling-studies program. There's a cultural component: In the '80s, young men were fed movies like "Wall Street," shown flashy cars and money, and told that greed is good. In the '90s and early 2000s, they were sold on more traditional forms of gambling and poker. Now they're being marketed sports betting and crypto. But it also goes deeper than that.</p><p>"For years, when we've studied gambling behaviors as well as other addictive behaviors, the trend has always been males more than females are impacted," Fong said. "People have said, well, is that a biological risk? Is that a culturally driven risk? Is that a psychological risk or a social risk factor? And basically, what I can say is that it's probably a combination."</p><p>There may be FOMO, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/gen-z-are-investing-crypto-stocks-because-of-fomo-survey-2023-6" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">as in fear of missing out</a>. Younger men see their friends playing in crypto or betting on sports, and they want to join in. Many of them have income they're not doing more productive things with, especially in the wake of a pandemic that has a lot of consumers who were once trying to save up thinking, "Eh, screw it." Maybe 40 years ago a 28-year-old had a mortgage and a family to support. Now he doesn't have those responsibilities and can direct disposable income toward whichever stock he just saw recommended on Reddit or a bet on whether the next pitch in a baseball game will be a ball or a strike.</p><es-blockquote data-styles="pullquote-breakout" data-quote="For years, when we've studied gambling behaviors as well as other addictive behaviors, the trend has always been males more than females are impacted" data-quote-updated="true" data-source="Add source (optional)" data-source-updated="false">

                            </es-blockquote><p>Kahlil Philander, a Washington State University professor who focuses on public policy and gambling, said this gambling boom is being compounded by a novelty effect. Many <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-gen-z-and-millennials-view-sports-betting-study-2021-3" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">young people are being exposed to gambling </a>for the first time. and a wide variety of products are being marketed aggressively to them. All the advertising dollars that have been spent on sports-betting platforms and crypto exchanges, for example, have amplified the exposure effect. The other part of the story is that many of these people haven't gambled before: Unlike a 60-year-old who's been there, done that, they haven't internalized the downsides.</p><p>"If there are risks or risk-mitigating strategies that individuals can take, they might not have learned those lessons yet," Philander said. "That can lead to higher levels of involvement, more harmful activity, all the types of things that people with more experience might have figured out for themselves one way or another."</p><p>At the heart of this is technology is the idea that guys don't have to walk over to the casino to place a bet or call a broker to trade a stock&nbsp;— they can just take out their phones.</p><!-- Excluded mobile ad on desktop --><p>"The technology that brings us that intersection between gambling, gaming, investing, and financial risk, that technology barrier is so low right now," Fong said.</p><p>For some young men, a level of nihilism about the economy leads to an impetus to take some risks. It shows up in movies like "Dumb Money," about the GameStop phenomenon, or "This Is Not Financial Advice," a documentary about dogecoin where the protagonists are portrayed as Davids against Goliaths — hedge funds, but also the economic system at large.</p><p>"We're at a place as a society where there are many new forms of gambling where the nature of investing and financial risk-taking is much different than it was before," Philander said.</p><p>The billionaire investor Warren Buffett, who has a penchant for <a target="_blank" href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/warren-buffett-bitcoin-gambling-token-crypto-market-outlook-berkshire-hathaway-2023-4" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">doing some finger-wagging</a> from time to time, described <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/warren-buffett-letter-munger-berkshire-annual-shareholder-stock-speculation-ai-2024-2" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">the shifting nature of investing</a> in his latest letter to Berkshire Hathaway investors.</p><p>"For whatever reasons, markets now exhibit far more casino-like behavior than they did when I was young," he wrote. "The casino now resides in many homes and daily tempts the occupants."</p><p>Along with the rise of new customers, problem-gambling behavior is increasing, especially among young men. A 2023 report on the prevalence of gambling in New Jersey — where sports betting and online gambling are legal, and where Atlantic City is — found that men had double the rate of high-risk problem gambling than women and that those ages 18 to 44 were at the highest risk. The New Jersey report identified a significant prevalence of high-risk stock trading among young men. In the state, which pushed to have the federal law prohibiting sports betting overturned, calls to its problem-gambling hotline tripled in five years, with people 25 to 34 being the likeliest to reach out.</p><es-blockquote data-styles="pullquote-right" data-quote="The casino now resides in many homes and daily tempts the occupants" data-quote-updated="true" data-source="Warren Buffett" data-source-updated="true">

                            </es-blockquote><p>Most people who gamble don't wind up with an addiction. According to the National Council on Problem Gambling, some 2.5 million Americans have a severe gambling problem, and another 5 million to 8 million have a problem it considers mild or moderate. That's a small sliver of the population. Plenty of people do some amount of betting and eventually fall off, or they dip in from time to time and are just fine. The public's interest in crypto ebbs and flows, and just because someone got into meme stocks for a while doesn't mean they're living on <a target="_blank" href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/3-meme-stocks-that-r-wallstreetbets-loves-but-shouldnt-1033148653" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Wall Street Bets</a> forever.</p><p>Still, the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-us-sports-betting-is-changing-media-companies-partnerships-ma-2021-12" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">explosion of playing so much with money</a> in the US is worrying, especially without a lot going on in the way of regulations, education, or safeguards to keep problem gambling in check. At least a sports-betting app will nudge someone to slow down if they go too far — there are virtually no protections in place if your day-trading habit gets out of hand, and many people don't even realize that what they're doing really is gambling. Fong told me he sees patients who will have lost thousands of dollars playing stocks and insist they just didn't time the market right.</p><!-- Excluded mobile ad on desktop --><p>"The one question I'll ask folks, I'll say, 'Does this behavior make your life better, or does it create problems?'" he said.

<h2 id="what-are-we-even-doing">What are we even doing?</h2>

<h2 id="why-build-a-weather-data-warehouse">Why build a weather data warehouse?</h2>

<p>I think it would be cool to have historical weather data from around the world to analyze for signals of climate change we’ve <em>already</em> had rather than think about potential future change.</p>

<p>If we had a huge weather data warehouse we could query it to figure out whether Jakarta is actually warmer or stormier these days and exactly how is it warmer (heat waves, winter highs, etc.). Or whether Chile is warming or getting cloudier as a whole, which could be region-specific. We could do this kind of analysis for every city or region on Earth to find out which places have already experienced the most climate change and what kind of change.</p>

<p>But to do this analysis globally we need to make querying the data warehouse fast, and there’s a lot of data. The first step is to load the data into a database of some kind. I’m going to try using PostgreSQL here. It should be a good learning experience and using TimescaleDB to speed up time-based queries and eventually PostGIS to speed up geospatial queries seems promising.</p>

<p>To get there though we first need to load all this data into Postgres and this is what this post is about. Initial attempts at loading the data seemed slow so I wanted to investigate how to do this fast, leading me down a rabbit hole and me writing this.<sup id="fnref:postgres-guide" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:postgres-guide" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Are we building a data warehouse? I think so…? Is a relational database even appropriate for gridded weather data? No idea but we’ll find out.</p>

<h2 id="whats-the-data">What’s the data?</h2>

<p>We are not working with actual weather observations. They are great, but can be sparse in certain regions especially in the past. Instead, we will be working with the ERA5 climate reanalysis product<sup id="fnref:era5-explanation" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:era5-explanation" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. It’s our best estimate of the historical state of the Earth’s weather and is widely used in weather and climate research.</p>

<p>The data is output from a climate model run that is constrained to match weather observations. So where we have lots of weather observations, ERA5 should match it closely. And where we do not have any weather observations, ERA5 will be physically consistent and should match the climatology, i.e. the simulated weather’s statistics should match reality. At the top of this page is a snapshot of what global surface temperature looks like and below is a snapshot of global precipitation.</p>

<figure>

  <p><img src="https://aliramadhan.me/img/trillion_rows/precipitation_figure.png" alt="global precipitation snapshot"></p>

  <figcaption>Global snapshot of precipitation rate at 2018-12-04 04:00:00 UTC.</figcaption>

</figure>

<p>Here’s what a time series of temperature looks like at one location.</p>

<figure>

  <p><img src="https://aliramadhan.me/img/trillion_rows/zoom_plot_temperature_Durban.png" alt="temperature time series"></p>

  <figcaption>Time series of surface temperature near Durban, South Africa.</figcaption>

</figure>

<p>ERA5 covers the entire globe at 0.25 degree resolution, and stretches back in time to 1940 with hourly resolution. Hourly data stretching back to 1940 is 727,080 snapshots in time for each variable like temperature, precipitation, cloud cover, wind speed, etc. A regularly-spaced latitude-longitude grid at 0.25 degree resolution has 1,038,240 grid points or locations (1440 longitudes and 721 latitudes including both poles). Together that’s 753,836,544,000 or ~754 billion rows of data if indexed by time and location. That’s a good amount of data. And as I found out, it’s not trivial to quickly shove this data into a relational database, much less be able to query it quickly.</p>

<p>The ERA5 data is distributed as NetCDF<sup id="fnref:netcdf-explanation" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:netcdf-explanation" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> files. You can query an API for the data or download it from certain providers but generally each file contains data for a day, a month, or a year. This chunking by time makes it quick and easy to query the dataset at single points in time, but looking at temporal patterns is very slow as many files need to be read to pull out a single time series. It takes like 20~30 minutes to pull out temperature data for one location to make the plot above! Complex geospatial queries, especially over time, will be slow and difficult to perform. Packages like <a href="https://xarray.dev/">xarray</a> and <a href="https://www.dask.org/">dask</a> (and efforts by <a href="https://pangeo.io/">Pangeo</a>) speed things up but it’s still a slow process.</p>

<p>We’ll just load in temperature, zonal and meridional wind speeds, total cloud cover, precipitation, and snowfall for each time and location so we’ll use this table schema:</p>

<pre><code>create table weather (
    time timestamptz not null,
    location_id int,
    latitude float4,
    longitude float4,
    temperature_2m float4,
    zonal_wind_10m float4,
    meridional_wind_10m float4,
    total_cloud_cover float4,
    total_precipitation float4,
    snowfall float4
);
</code></pre>

<p>And before you mention database normalization, yes I have both a <code>location_id</code> column and <code>latitude</code> and <code>longitude</code> columns. It’s for later benchmarking with queries and indexes.</p>

<h2 id="the-insert-statement">The <code>insert</code> statement</h2>

<h2 id="starting-with-just-the-single-row-insert-statement">Starting with just the single-row <code>insert</code> statement</h2>

<p>The simplest way to load data into a table is by using the <code>insert</code> command to insert a single row. This looks something like</p>

<pre><code>insert into weather (
    time,
    location_id,
    latitude,
    longitude,
    temperature_2m,
    zonal_wind_10m,
    meridional_wind_10m,
    total_cloud_cover,
    total_precipitation,
    snowfall
) values ('1995-03-10 16:00:00+00', 346441, -30, 30.25, 15.466888,
          -2.0585022, 0.25202942, 0.9960022, 0.007845461, 0);
</code></pre>

<p>and so you can just loop over all the data doing this row-by-row. Unfortunately it is quite slow as quite a bit goes on behind the scenes here:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Postgres needs to parse the statement, validate table and column names, and plan the best way to execute it.</li>
  <li>Postgres may need to lock the table to ensure data integrity.<sup id="fnref:mvcc-explanation" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:mvcc-explanation" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></li>
  <li>The data is written to a buffer as Postgres uses a write-ahead logging<sup id="fnref:wal-explanation" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:wal-explanation" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> (or WAL) system.</li>
  <li>Data from the buffer is actually inserted into the table on disk (which may involve navigating through and updating indexes, but we won’t have any here).</li>
  <li>If the <code>insert</code> statement is part of a transaction<sup id="fnref:transaction-explanation" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:transaction-explanation" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> that is committed, then the changes are made permanent.</li>
</ol>

<p>So there’s a lot of overhead associated with inserting single rows, especially if each <code>insert</code> gets its own transaction.</p>

<p>How many rows can we actually insert per second using single-row inserts? After loading the data from NetCDF into a pandas dataframe I found three<sup id="fnref:orm-explanation" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:orm-explanation" rel="footnote">7</a></sup> ways to insert the data into Postgres from Python so let’s benchmark all three:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>pandas</strong>: You can insert data straight from a dataframe using the <code>df.to_sql()</code> function with the <code>chunksize=1</code> keyword argument to force single-row inserts.</li>
  <li><strong>psycopg3</strong>: You can use <a href="https://www.psycopg.org/psycopg3/docs/basic/params.html">parameterized queries</a> to protect against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection">SQL injection</a>, not that it’s a risk here (yet) but it’s good to practice safety I guess. All inserts are part of one transaction that is committed at the end.</li>
  <li><strong>SQLAlchemy</strong>: You can similarly use named parameters in a parameterized query to prevent SQL injection attacks.</li>
</ol>

<figure>

  <p><img src="https://aliramadhan.me/img/trillion_rows/benchmarks_insert.png" alt="single-row insert benchmarks"></p>

  <figcaption>
    Blue bars show the median insert rate into a regular PostgreSQL table, while orange bars show the median insert rate into a TimescaleDB hypertable. Each benchmark inserted 20k rows and was repeated 10 times. The error bars show the range of insert rates given by the 10th and 90th percentiles.
</figcaption>

</figure>

<p>I benchmarked inserting into a regular Postgres table and a TimescaleDB hypertable<sup id="fnref:hypertable-explanation" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:hypertable-explanation" rel="footnote">8</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Pandas and psycopg3 perform similarly, with a slight edge to psycopg3. SQLAlchemy is the slowest even though we’re not using its ORM tool. This may be because it introduces extra overhead with its abstractions around session management and compiled SQL expressions.</p>

<p>Inserting into a Timescale hypertable is a bit slower. This is maybe because rows are being inserted into a hypertable with chunks so there may be some overhead there, even if there’s only one chunk.</p>

<p>So at best we’re only getting ~3000 inserts per second with single-row inserts at which rate we’re gonna have to wait ~8 years for all the data to load 🦥 There must be a faster way.</p>

<h2 id="multi-valued-insert">Multi-valued <code>insert</code></h2>

<p>You can insert multiple rows with one <code>insert</code> statement. This is called a multi-valued or bulk insert and looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>insert into weather (
    time,
    location_id,
    latitude,
    longitude,
    temperature_2m,
    zonal_wind_10m,
    meridional_wind_10m,
    total_cloud_cover,
    total_precipitation,
    snowfall
) values
    ('1995-03-02 04:00:00+00', 346444, -30, 31, 21.54013,
     7.1091003, 5.9887085, 1, 2.7820282, 0),
    ('1995-03-02 05:00:00+00', 346444, -30, 31, 21.596466,
     7.0369415, 6.2397766, 0.95751953, 2.1944494, 0),
    ('1995-03-02 06:00:00+00', 346444, -30, 31, 21.660583,
     6.303482, 6.017273, 0.88571167, 1.9253268, 0);
</code></pre>

<p>This is faster for a few reasons. There’s less network overhead as each single-row insert requires a network round trip for each row inserted. Postgres also only has to parse and plan once. Multi-row inserts can also be further optimized when it comes to updating indexes. It seems that you can bulk insert as many rows as you want as long as they fit in memory.</p>

<p>In pandas it sounds like you can do this by passing the <code>method="multi"</code> keyword argument to the <code>df.to_sql()</code> function but I found this to be a bit slower than single-row inserts with <code>chunksize=1</code>. So I just didn’t set a method or chunk size and supposedly all rows will be written at once, and it was faster. With psycopg3 you can construct or stream a list of tuples, one for each row, and insert them all at once. With SQLAlchemy it’s a dict of tuples.</p>

<figure>

  <p><img src="https://aliramadhan.me/img/trillion_rows/benchmarks_multi_insert.png" alt="multi-valued insert benchmarks"></p>

  <figcaption>This time each benchmark inserted 100k rows and was repeated 10 times.</figcaption>

</figure>

<p>Now there’s a clear winner with psycopg3 at 25~30k inserts/sec. I’m not sure why psycopg3 is faster but it looks like pandas is <a href="https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/a671b5a8bf5dd13fb19f0e88edc679bc9e15c673/pandas/io/sql.py#L938-L968">using dictionaries to insert</a> which can be slower than just plain tuples. SQLAlchemy might be extra slow slow here because of additional overhead like with single-row inserts and I also passed it dictionaries.</p>

<p>With multi-row inserts there’s an order-of-magnitude improvement but at ~30k inserts per second, we’re still gonna have to wait ~0.8 years or almost 10 months for all the data to load 🐢</p>

<h2 id="the-copy-statement">The <code>copy</code> statement</h2>

<h2 id="upgrading-to-the-copy-statement">Upgrading to the <code>copy</code> statement</h2>

<p>For loading in larger amounts of data, Postgres has the <code>copy</code> statement allowing us to insert rows from a CSV file or from a binary file.<sup id="fnref:copy-binary-note" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:copy-binary-note" rel="footnote">9</a></sup> <code>copy</code> is faster than multi-row inserts as Postgres reads data straight from the file and optimizes parsing, planning, and WAL usage knowing there is a lot of data to load.</p>

<p>Once you have a CSV file it’s as simple as</p>

<pre><code>copy weather from some_big.csv delimiter ',' csv header;
</code></pre>

<p>We have the option of saving data from NetCDF files as CSV files then using <code>copy</code>. This honestly feels inefficient as saving timestamps and floating-point numbers as plaintext to disk takes up more space that it should then reading it from disk seems like it would be slow, but Postgres seems to have optimized this operation. We also have the option of not saving the data into CSV files and streaming it straight into Postgres using psycopg3’s <code>cusor.copy()</code> function.</p>

<p>When benchmarking <code>copy</code> vs. <code>psycopg3.cursor.copy()</code> we are starting with a pandas dataframe so we must account for the time it takes to save all the data to CSV files on disk in the case of <code>copy csv</code>. In the case of <code>cursor.copy()</code> if we stream a list of tuples then the only overhead is creating the cursor and tuple generator.</p>

<figure>

  <p><img src="https://aliramadhan.me/img/trillion_rows/benchmarks_copy.png" alt="copy benchmarks"></p>

  <figcaption>
    Here the full rate includes overhead (writing CSV files or constructing tuples) while the copy rate does not. This time each benchmark inserted 1,038,240 rows (1 day of ERA5 data) and was repeated 10 times.
</figcaption>

</figure>

<p>We see that <code>copy</code> can actually insert close to 400k rows per second, but that is if you already have the CSV file ready to go. Including overhead, both <code>copy</code> and psycopg3 can manage around 100k inserts/second with psycopg3 being a bit faster. For some reason there seems to be no difference between regular table and hypertable performance for psycopg3.</p>

<p>At ~100k inserts/second we’re still talking about ~3 months to load all the data 🐌</p>

<h2 id="sustaining-copy-insert-rates">Sustaining <code>copy</code> insert rates</h2>

<p>When inserting <em>many</em> rows, Postgres may encounter bottlenecks<sup id="fnref:write-bottlenecks" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:write-bottlenecks" rel="footnote">10</a></sup> so it’s important that the insert rate can be sustained. To look at this, we can insert hundreds of millions of rows and watch for fluctuations in the insert rate.</p>

<figure>

  <p><img src="https://aliramadhan.me/img/trillion_rows/benchmarks_copy_at_scale.png" alt="copy at scale benchmarks"></p>

  <figcaption>
    For this benchmark, rows were inserted in 744 batches of 1,038,240 rows for a total of ~772 million rows. The overall insert rate is plotted. The dots show the insert rate for each batch while the solid lines show a 10-batch rolling mean. The straight horizontal lines show the mean insert rate over the entire benchmark. Note that the lines orange and blue straight lines are right on top of each other.
</figcaption>

</figure>

<p>It seems that, at least with one worker, we don’t see huge drops in insert rates although <code>copy csv</code> shows frequent drops and seems more susceptible to fluctuations. psycopg3 is generally faster and interestingly there isn’t much of a difference between copying into a regular table or hypertable.</p>

<h2 id="parallel-copy">Parallel <code>copy</code></h2>

<p>Inserting data with <code>copy</code> is fast but can we speed it up by executing multiple <code>copy</code> operations in parallel? Using the joblib package we can execute multiple <code>copy</code> statements or psycopg3 cursors in parallel.</p>

<figure>

  <p><img src="https://aliramadhan.me/img/trillion_rows/benchmarks_parallel_copy.png" alt="parallel copy benchmarks"></p>

  <figcaption>
    The overall insert rate is plotted as a function of the number of workers. Each benchmark inserted 128 hours of ERA5 data (~133 million rows).
</figcaption>

</figure>

<p>Inserting data into a single table is not super parallelizable so it looks like performance generally plateaus after 16 workers.<sup id="fnref:better-parallel-benchmark" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:better-parallel-benchmark" rel="footnote">11</a></sup></p>



<h2 id="pg_bulkload-and-timescaledb-parallel-copy">pg_bulkload and timescaledb-parallel-copy</h2>

<p>Beyond the <code>copy</code> statement, there are external tools for loading large amounts of data into Postgres. I’ll benchmark two of them, <a href="https://github.com/ossc-db/pg_bulkload">pg_bulkload</a> and <a href="https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb-parallel-copy">timescaledb-parallel-copy</a>.</p>

<figure>

  <p><img src="https://aliramadhan.me/img/trillion_rows/benchmarks_tools.png" alt="tools benchmarks"></p>

  <figcaption>
    Blue and orange bars show results from benchmarks that inserted 1,038,240 rows (1 day of ERA5 data) and were repeated 10 times. The sustained insert rates are from benchmarks that inserted 256 hours of ERA5 data (~266 million rows) into a hypertable. In these benchmarks the CSV files were already written to disk so the insert rate corresponds to the "copy rate" from the copy benchmarks. The insert rate including overhead accounts for the time it takes to write the CSV files to disk.
</figcaption>

</figure>

<p>At first it would seem that pg_bulkload is much faster, however, this is because by default it bypasses the shared buffers and skips WAL logging so data recovery following a crash may not be possible while timescaledb-parallel-copy does not and does things more safely. On a level playing field with <code>fsync</code> off (see next section for an explanation) timescaledb-parallel-copy with multiple workers beats out pg_bulkload.</p>

<h2 id="multiple-workers-with-timescaledb-parallel-copy">Multiple workers with timescaledb-parallel-copy</h2>

<p>timescaledb-parallel-copy lets you specify the number of workers inserting data in parallel. Let’s see how much performance we can squeeze out with more workers, and if that performance can be sustained.</p>

<figure>

  <p><img src="https://aliramadhan.me/img/trillion_rows/benchmarks_parallel_tpc.png" alt="timescaledb-parallel-copy benchmarks"></p>

  <figcaption>
    The insert rate as a function of the number of rows inserted. In this benchmark the CSV files were already written to disk so the insert rate corresponds to the "copy rate" from the copy benchmarks. Each benchmark inserted 256 hours of ERA5 data (~266 million rows). Note the vertical log scale.
</figcaption>

</figure>

<p>Initial performance looks great! But eventually, before 100 million rows on my system, a bottleneck is reached and the insert rate tanks before picking back up in waves. The maximum sustained insert rate is around 600~700k inserts/sec for regular tables and ~300k for hypertables.</p>

<p>pg_bulkload doesn’t let you specify the number of threads or workers, but does have a <code>writer=parallel</code> option which uses multiple threads to do data reading, parsing and writing in parallel. We’ll look at its insert rate later.</p>

<h2 id="tweaking-postgres-settings">Tweaking Postgres settings</h2>

<p>There are a couple of other things we can try to speed up inserts, but are basically some form of tweaking <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/non-durability.html">Postgres’ non-durable settings</a>.</p>

<p>Some extra performance can be squeezed out of tweaking non-durable settings specifically for loading data following suggestions by <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/12207237">Craig Ringer on StackOverflow</a>. Some of the settings can be dangerous for database integrity in the event of a crash though. The main settings to change are turning off <code>fsync</code> to avoid flushing data to disk and also turning off <code>full_page_writes</code> to avoid guarding against partial page writes.</p>

<p>You can also insert data into an unlogged table that generates no WAL and gets truncated upon crash recovery but is faster to write into. While inserting into an unlogged table might be fast, you still have to convert it to a regular logged table afterwards which can be a <a href="https://dba.stackexchange.com/a/195829">slow single-threaded process</a>. And hypertables cannot be unlogged, so if you want a hypertable you need to further convert/migrate the regular logged table to a hypertable which can also be slow.</p>

<h2 id="so-whats-the-best-method">So what’s the best method?</h2>

<p><strong>Short answer: Use psycopg3 to directly copy data into a hypertable. If you already have CSV files then use timescaledb-parallel-copy. For parallelization the sweet spot seems to be 12~16 workers on my system.</strong></p>

<p>We want to end up with a hypertable but it seems like inserting into a regular table is faster. So is it faster to insert into a regular table then convert it to a hypertable? Or is it faster to just insert data straight into a hypertable?</p>

<figure>

  <p><img src="https://aliramadhan.me/img/trillion_rows/conversion_time.png" alt="table conversion time"></p>

  <figcaption>
    Blue bars show the wall clock time taken to insert data into the table and the orange bar shows the time taken to convert the regular table into a hypertable.
</figcaption>

</figure>

<p>A quick test with inserting ~772 million rows with psycopg3’s copy and 16 workers shows that inserting data into a hypertable is faster as it takes roughly 80% of the time in this case. This may not always be the case but inserting into a regular table then converting it to a hypertable and migrating the data will probably always be slower as the conversion/migration process is not super fast and seems to be single-threaded.</p>

<p>Now that we’ve concluded we want to be inserting data into a hypertable, let’s take a look at the all hypertable insert rates we’ve considered in one plot.</p>

<figure>

  <p><img src="https://aliramadhan.me/img/trillion_rows/benchmarks_summary.png" alt="benchmarks summary"></p>

  <figcaption>
    Sustained hypertable insert rates including overhead (writing CSV files) for different insertion methods. Here "tpc" is short for timescaledb-parallel-copy and "pgb" is short for pg_bulkload. "32W" means 32 workers were used for that benchmark.

<p>For pg_bulkload with a single worker the the <code>writer=buffered</code> option was used. For multiple workers, the <code>writer=buffered</code> and <code>multi_process=yes</code> options were used. Then for multiple workers with fsync off, the <code>writer=parallel</code> option was used.</p>

<p>So what can we conclude?</p>

<ol>
  <li>At least on my hardware it seems there’s a ceiling of ~140k sustained inserts/sec with overhead when using a single worker with protections on. pg_bulkload wins here by quite a bit.</li>
  <li>You can use multiple workers to increase the sustained insert rate up to ~250k inserts/sec with psycopg3’s copy cursor while still being protected.</li>
  <li>The insertion process is not very parallelizable so the sweet spot is 4-16 workers. The benchmarks used 32 workers to maximize insert rates.</li>
  <li>If you’re okay living a bit dangerously you can turn off fsync and sustain an insert rate of ~462k inserts/sec with psycopg3! You’ll also squeeze out a bit more performance out of timescaledb-parallell-copy.</li>
  <li>Be careful when using pg_bulkload as it disables <code>fsync</code> by default.</li>
  <li>These conclusions assume you need to do extra work to convert data to CSV files which is why psycopg3 was the clear winner, although it does seem pretty fast. If you’re starting with CSV files timescaledb-parallel-copy is probably faster (and quicker to set up).</li>
</ol>

<p>Some closing thoughts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Want even faster inserts? You should probably upgrade your hardware. A nice enterprise-grade NvME SSD and lots of high-speed DDR5 RAM will help a lot. I used hardware that is roughly 5 years old so newer hardware should be able to easily beat these benchmarks.</li>
  <li>I know the general wisdom is to just dump this data into Snowflake or BigQuery and get fast analytics for relatively cheap. But I like working with my own hardware and learning this way. Plus I have no real budget for this project.</li>
  <li>I’d be curious how ClickHouse performs on these benchmarks. My impression is that it would probably be faster out of the box. But I want to learn PostgreSQL and like the fact that TimescaleDB is just a Postgres extension so I went with TimescaleDB.</li>
</ol>

<p>At a sustained ~462k inserts per second, we’re waiting ~20 days for our ~754 billion rows which is not bad I guess 🐨 It’s less time than it took me to write this post.</p>

<p>The code used to download the ERA5 data, create the tables, insert/copy data, run benchmarks, and plot figures is at the <a href="https://github.com/ali-ramadhan/timescaledb-insert-benchmarks">timescaledb-insert-benchmarks</a> repository.</p>

<h2 id="benchmarking-methodology">Benchmarking methodology</h2>

<p>To ensure a consistent environment for benchmarking, a new Docker container was spun up for each individual benchmark. No storage was persisted between Docker containers. Data including NetCDF and CSV files were read from a HDD and the database was stored on an NvME SSD.</p>

<p>Hardware:</p>

<ul>
  <li>CPU: 2x 12-core Intel Xeon Silver 4214</li>
  <li>RAM: 16x 16 GiB Samsung M393A2K40CB2-CTD ECC DDR4 2666 MT/s</li>
  <li>SSD: Intel SSDPEKNW020T8 2 TB NvME</li>
  <li>HDD: Seagate Exos X16 14TB 7200 RPM 256MB Cache</li>
</ul>

<p>Software:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ubuntu 20.04 with Linux kernel 5.15</li>
  <li>PostgreSQL 15.5</li>
  <li>TimescaleDB 2.13.0</li>
  <li>pg_bulkload 3.1.20</li>
</ul>

<p>Postgres configuration chosen by <code>timescaledb-tune</code>:</p>

<pre><code>shared_buffers = 64144MB
effective_cache_size = 192434MB
maintenance_work_mem = 2047MB
work_mem = 13684kB
timescaledb.max_background_workers = 16
max_worker_processes = 67
max_parallel_workers_per_gather = 24
max_parallel_workers = 48

Recommendations based on 250.57 GB of available memory and 48 CPUs for PostgreSQL 15
wal_buffers = 16MB
min_wal_size = 512MB
default_statistics_target = 100
random_page_cost = 1.1
checkpoint_completion_target = 0.9
max_locks_per_transaction = 512
autovacuum_max_workers = 10
autovacuum_naptime = 10
effective_io_concurrency = 256
</code></pre>

<p>For benchmarking I set the WAL size:</p>

<pre><code>min_wal_size = 4GB
max_wal_size = 16GB
</code></pre>

<p>And for the <code>fsync</code> off benchmarks I set:</p>

<pre><code>max_wal_size = 32GB
fsync = off
full_page_writes = off
</code></pre>

        <p>NPR suspended senior editor Uri Berliner for five days without pay after he wrote an essay accusing the network of losing the public's trust and appeared on a podcast to explain his argument.</p>

   <p>NPR has formally punished Uri Berliner, the senior editor who publicly argued a week ago that the network had "lost America's trust" by approaching news stories with a rigidly progressive mindset.</p>   <p>Berliner's five-day suspension without pay, which began last Friday, has not been previously reported.</p>   <p>Yet the public radio network is grappling in other ways with the fallout from <a href="https://www.thefp.com/p/npr-editor-how-npr-lost-americas-trust">Berliner's essay for the online news site The Free Press</a>. It angered many of his colleagues, led NPR leaders to announce monthly internal reviews of the network's coverage, and gave fresh ammunition to conservative and partisan Republican critics of NPR, including former President Donald Trump.</p>   
   <p>Conservative activist <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/01/03/christopher-rufo-claudine-gay-harvard-resignation-00133618">Christopher Rufo</a> is among those now targeting NPR's new chief executive, Katherine Maher, for messages she posted to social media years before joining the network. Among others, those posts include <a href="https://twitter.com/krmaher/status/1260960520586145797">a 2020 tweet that called Trump racist</a> and another that appeared to minimize rioting during social justice protests that year. Maher took the job at NPR last month — her <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/01/24/1226035539/npr-ceo-katherine-maher-wikimedia">first at a news organization</a>.</p>   <p>In a statement Monday about the messages she had posted, Maher praised the integrity of NPR's journalists and underscored the independence of their reporting.</p>   <p>"In America everyone is entitled to free speech as a private citizen," she said. "What matters is NPR's work and my commitment as its CEO: public service, editorial independence, and the mission to serve all of the American public. NPR is independent, beholden to no party, and without commercial interests."</p>   <p>The network noted that "the CEO is not involved in editorial decisions."</p>   <p>In an interview with me later on Monday, Berliner said the social media posts demonstrated Maher was all but incapable of being the person best poised to direct the organization.</p>   <p>"We're looking for a leader right now who's going to be unifying and bring more people into the tent and have a broader perspective on, sort of, what America is all about," Berliner said. "And this seems to be the opposite of that."</p>   <div id="res1244985594">

   <p>He said that he tried repeatedly to make his concerns over NPR's coverage known to news leaders and to Maher's predecessor as chief executive before publishing his essay.</p>   <p>Berliner has singled out coverage of several issues dominating the 2020s for criticism, including trans rights, the Israel-Hamas war and COVID. Berliner says he sees the same problems at other news organizations, but argues NPR, as a mission-driven institution, has a greater obligation to fairness.</p>   <p>"I love NPR and feel it's a national trust," Berliner says. "We have great journalists here. If they shed their opinions and did the great journalism they're capable of, this would be a much more interesting and fulfilling organization for our listeners."</p>   
   <h3>A "final warning"</h3>   <p>The circumstances surrounding the interview were singular.</p>   <p>Berliner provided me with a copy of the formal rebuke to review. NPR did not confirm or comment upon his suspension for this article.</p>   <p>In presenting Berliner's suspension Thursday afternoon, the organization told the editor he had failed to secure its approval for outside work for other news outlets, as is required of NPR journalists. It called the letter a "final warning," saying Berliner would be fired if he violated NPR's policy again. Berliner is a dues-paying member of NPR's newsroom union but says he is not appealing the punishment.</p>   <p>The Free Press is a site that has become a haven for journalists who believe that mainstream media outlets have become too liberal. In addition to his essay, Berliner appeared in an episode of its podcast <em>Honestly </em>with Bari Weiss.</p>   <p>A few hours after the essay appeared online, NPR chief business editor Pallavi Gogoi reminded Berliner of the requirement that he secure approval before appearing in outside press, according to a copy of the note provided by Berliner. </p>   <p>In its formal rebuke, NPR did not cite Berliner's appearance on Chris Cuomo's NewsNation program last Tuesday night, for which NPR gave him the green light. (NPR's chief communications officer told Berliner to focus on his own experience and not share proprietary information.) The NPR letter also did not cite <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/11/business/media/npr-criticism-liberal-bias.html">his remarks to <em>The New York Times</em></a>, which ran its article mid-afternoon Thursday, shortly before the reprimand was sent. Berliner says he did not seek approval before talking with the <em>Times</em>.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1244978861" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>Berliner says he did not get permission from NPR to speak with me for this story but that he was not worried about the consequences: "Talking to an NPR journalist and being fired for that would be extraordinary, I think."</p>   <p>Berliner is a member of NPR's business desk, as am I, and he has helped to edit many of my stories. He had no involvement in the preparation of this article and did not see it before it was posted publicly.</p>   
   <p>In rebuking Berliner, NPR said he had also publicly released proprietary information about audience demographics, which it considers confidential. He said those figures "were essentially marketing material. If they had been really good, they probably would have distributed them and sent them out to the world."</p>   <h3>Feelings of anger and betrayal inside the newsroom</h3>   <p>His essay and subsequent public remarks stirred deep anger and dismay within NPR. Colleagues contend Berliner cherry-picked examples to fit his arguments and challenge the accuracy of his accounts. They also note he did not seek comment from the journalists involved in the work he cited.</p>   <p><em>Morning Edition</em> host Michel Martin told me some colleagues at the network share Berliner's concerns that coverage is frequently presented through an ideological or idealistic prism that can alienate listeners.</p>   <p>"The way to address that is through training and mentorship," says Martin, herself a veteran of nearly two decades at the network who has also reported for <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> and ABC News. "It's not by blowing the place up, by trashing your colleagues, in full view of people who don't really care about it anyway."</p>   <p>Several NPR journalists told me they are no longer willing to work with Berliner as they no longer have confidence that he will keep private their internal musings about stories as they work through coverage.</p>   <p>"Newsrooms run on trust," <a href="https://twitter.com/titonka/status/1778461456410800339">NPR political correspondent Danielle Kurtzleben tweeted</a> last week, without mentioning Berliner by name. "If you violate everyone's trust by going to another outlet and sh--ing on your colleagues (while doing a bad job journalistically, for that matter), I don't know how you do your job now."</p>   <p>Berliner rejected that critique, saying nothing in his essay or subsequent remarks betrayed private observations or arguments about coverage.</p>   <p>Other newsrooms are also grappling with questions over news judgment and confidentiality. On Monday, <em>New York Times </em>Executive Editor Joseph Kahn announced to his staff that the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/03/06/1236130609/new-york-times-hamas-attacks-israel-palestine">newspaper's inquiry</a> into who leaked internal dissent over a planned episode of its podcast <em>The Daily</em> to another news outlet proved inconclusive. The episode was to focus on a December report on the use of sexual assault as part of the Hamas attack on Israel in October. Audio staffers aired doubts over how well the reporting stood up to scrutiny.</p>   
   <p>"We work together with trust and collegiality everyday on everything we produce, and I have every expectation that this incident will prove to be a singular exception to an important rule," Kahn wrote to <em>Times</em> staffers.</p>   <p>At NPR, some of Berliner's colleagues have weighed in online against his claim that the network has focused on diversifying its workforce without a concomitant commitment to diversity of viewpoint. Recently retired Chief Executive John Lansing has referred to this pursuit of diversity within NPR's workforce as its "<a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/01/11/1072104110/lulu-garcia-navarro-audie-cornish-noel-king-leave-npr">North Star</a>," a moral imperative and chief business strategy.</p>   <p>In his essay, Berliner tagged the strategy as a failure, citing the drop in NPR's broadcast audiences and its struggle to attract more Black and Latino listeners in particular.</p>   <p>"During most of my tenure here, an open-minded, curious culture prevailed. We were nerdy, but not knee-jerk, activist, or scolding," Berliner writes. "In recent years, however, that has changed."</p>   <p>Berliner writes, "For NPR, which purports to consider all things, it's devastating both for its journalism and its business model."</p>   <p>NPR investigative reporter Chiara Eisner wrote in a comment for this story: "Minorities do not all think the same and do not report the same. Good reporters and editors should know that by now. It's embarrassing to me as a reporter at NPR that a senior editor here missed that point in 2024."</p>   <p>Some colleagues drafted a letter to Maher and NPR's chief news executive, Edith Chapin, seeking greater clarity on NPR's standards for its coverage and the behavior of its journalists — clearly pointed at Berliner.</p>   <h3>A plan for "healthy discussion"</h3>   <p>On Friday, CEO Maher stood up for the network's mission and the journalism, taking issue with Berliner's critique, though never mentioning him by name. Among her chief issues, she said Berliner's essay offered "a criticism of our people on the basis of who we are."</p>   
   <p>Berliner took great exception to that, saying she had denigrated him. He said that he supported diversifying NPR's workforce to look more like the U.S. population at large. She did not address that in a subsequent private exchange he shared with me for this story. (An NPR spokesperson declined further comment.)</p>   <p>Late Monday afternoon, Chapin announced to the newsroom that Executive Editor Eva Rodriguez would lead monthly meetings to review coverage.</p>   <p>"Among the questions we'll ask of ourselves each month: Did we capture the diversity of this country — racial, ethnic, religious, economic, political geographic, etc — in all of its complexity and in a way that helped listeners and readers recognize themselves and their communities?" Chapin wrote in the memo. "Did we offer coverage that helped them understand — even if just a bit better — those neighbors with whom they share little in common?"</p>   <p>Berliner said he welcomed the announcement but would withhold judgment until those meetings played out.</p>   <p>In a text for this story, Chapin said such sessions had been discussed since Lansing unified the news and programming divisions under her acting leadership last year.</p>   <p>"Now seemed [the] time to deliver if we were going to do it," Chapin said. "Healthy discussion is something we need more of."</p>   <p><em>Disclosure: This story was reported and written by NPR Media Correspondent David Folkenflik and edited by Deputy Business Editor Emily Kopp and Managing Editor Gerry Holmes.

<p>A small UK stock exchange called Aquis hosts their matching engine in the cloud. Crypto exchanges are all cloud-based too. What if the NYSE, CME and others followed? The NASDAQ is already thinking about this since 2021. Let’s evaluate about how HFTs would adapt, and how small-time traders could benefit.</p>



<h2>A brief intro to ULL (ultra low latency) trading infra</h2>



<p>ULL trading firms go to a lot of trouble to get their servers and switches within the same buildings as the exchanges they trade with to reduce latency. Some firms don’t even use layer 1 switches to be competitive. </p>



<p>Most major exchanges run out of public data centres, for example:</p>



<ul>
<li>The <strong>NASDAQ </strong>is in an Equinix facility called NY11 in Carteret, NJ</li>



<li>The <strong>CME </strong>is in a site called Aurora</li>



<li>The <strong>LME </strong>sits in a Digital Realty facility Brick Lane (London), and so on</li>
</ul>



<p>The <strong>NYSE</strong> runs out of a facility in <strong>Mahwah, NJ, </strong>and whilst not a public colo, you can still rent a rack there.</p>



<p>You’ll pay heavily for a rack in one of these data centres. Individual quant traders cannot simply deploy ULL strategies here, due to the difficulty of sourcing the right hardware and getting set up in a site. You could go to a provider like Pico, but good infra is half of the competitive advantage when trading ULL (the other half is writing the trading strategy in low-level code and deploying it before other HFTs).</p>



<p>It’s not unthinkable that these facilities migrate to the cloud (which is where Coinbase’s trading happens).</p>



<h2>Can I trade stocks at low latency myself?</h2>



<ol>
<li>Reach out to Equinix, get a rack in NY4 with 5kVA power and about 4 cross connects</li>



<li>Reach out to Arista and get a <a href="https://www.arista.com/en/products/7130-layer-1-network-switches-quick-look" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">7130</a> low latency switch</li>



<li>Buy a Xilinx card that supports <a href="https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/x2-series/onload.html">Onload</a>, put it in a server, do this x2 for reliability</li>



<li>Buy a time server to handle PTP so you know exactly when the market opens</li>



<li>Become a member of the NYSE</li>



<li>Pay for market data</li>



<li>Get an Internet connection so you can connect your server to deploy strats</li>
</ol>



<p>You’re looking at six to seven figures of set up costs and about that in yearly running costs. In other words, it’s not happening. Similar pains will exist for trading FX with some bank like Citi, or futures with the CME.</p>



<h2>Low(ish) latency crypto</h2>



<p>Smart quant crypto traders will spin up many thousands of EC2 instances, measure latency to the exchange, and only keep the best instances, continually. This process allows them to eventually get EC2 instances to trade from probably in the same rack, or maybe on the same bare metal box, as the exchange. This is pretty good going. Traffic will still be routed through some sort of overlay network, but everyone has that penalty. There are no large upfront costs to setting up a strategy and market data is free.</p>



<h2>So, what happens if exchanges move?</h2>



<p>The NASDAQ is already bringing AWS infra into their facilities (<a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/nasdaq-to-migrate-to-aws-use-on-premise-data-center-as-private-aws-local-zone/">link</a>). So let’s say the NYSE went full cloud tomorrow with AWS – what happens?</p>



<h5>You’re already behind</h5>



<p>ULL leaders like Jump Trading, XTX and PDT Partners probably already thought this through, so will already be ahead of you. They’d immediately deploy the abovementioned gameplan to continually find the lowest latency boxes. They’d probably try some EKS instances and bare metal instances too, in case the matching engines are now containerized, or bare-metal-ized.</p>



<h5>Time-keeping</h5>



<p>If you’re on a VM, you’re probably getting time via the hypervisor, but is it accurate enough? If you have a great strategy that needs to buy and sell two stocks 100 nanos (ns) after the open, and you know you’re <mark>3 mics</mark> (µs) away from the matching engine, you may want to send those two trades at 09:29:59.99999<mark>7</mark><mark>1</mark> at the hope your order arrives at <mark>100ns</mark> past 9.30am. Since 2023, high-precision PTP has been available on some EC2 instances (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/11/amazon-time-sync-service-microsecond-accurate-time/">link</a>), so it’s likely you’d want to be on one of these boxes. Amazon says the accuracy is “within microseconds” so this could be problematic. A strategy could be to send multiple trades at 09:29:59.99999{…, 4,5,6} and see if they get filled, but this risks double-trading (and breaking the exchange’s rules) which may well itself affect the strategy’s alpha.</p>



<h5>Market data</h5>



<p>The NYSE might make it your problem to deal with recording data, or they may make an S3 bucket available to anyone who pays them. Anyways, you probably want to pipe that directly into the strategy at filesystem level from the virtual NIC, and secondarily into Kafka/RedPanda and into something like kdb+ or ClickHouse to look at later.</p>



<h5>Strats/alphas</h5>



<p>Next, the strats. All HDL-written code for FPGAs becomes irrelevant, and winning strategies would quickly be ported to C, compiled with some optimal compiler for wahtever CPU the VM/container/bare metal box chosen is running on. For example, Intel has Math Kernel Library, whilst AMD has their own called AOCL. Strategies may even need to be compiled with optimizations for both.</p>



<h5>Optimisations</h5>



<ol>
<li><strong>Running some more lightweight OS</strong> like an ultra-thinned down Debian guest might yield some advantages to stock EC2 instances. This would be at the trade-off of increasing the time to build VMs, which will almost always land up somewhere useless for latency purposes.</li>



<li><strong>Going to bare metal even when the exchange is on EC2</strong> might still be better if you could remove some crucial mics of hypervisor overhead. The create and kill game might need to be played with EC2 Bare Metal, and this may offend Amazon.</li>



<li><strong>Hogging instances</strong> might pay, if this stops competitors getting good hosts. This would eat into PnL and is also wasteful on energy.</li>
</ol>



<h5>Nasty stuff that might happen</h5>



<ol>
<li>Bad players could do a ping test to many thousands of EC2 instances, find those which are also at very low latency to their good boxes (assuming these are competitors), and DDoS them during trading hours to hammer the hypervisor’s NIC. This would result in critical overhead occurring for competitors sending orders out.</li>



<li>Bad players could also generate large bursts of traffic on good EC2 instances they control on hypervisors believed to be close to the exchange, but don’t plan to trade on, to achieve the same thing in a less blatantly offensive way (e.g. say 40 servers in a rack, you guesstimate which physical box your trading VM is on, but also try find VMs on the other 39 good servers, and just generate spam traffic to add overhead to the actual NICs).</li>
</ol>



<h5>Unsolved problems</h5>



<ol>
<li>How would you short <strong>AMZN</strong> stock if there was an outage on AWS? This is super convenient for Amazon.</li>
</ol>



<h2>Winners and losers</h2>



<p>Smaller quant shops and sophisticated home traders are the winners, whilst professional HFTs would be losers due to their sophisticated hardware advantages becoming worthless.</p>



<p>Equinix is also a loser, and obviously Amazon is the biggest winner overall.</p>



<h2>Why did Aquis move?</h2>



<ol>
<li><strong>They probably can’t differentiate massively </strong>with LSEG or Euronext (who have way bigger tech spend), so being cloud-based is something different to do.</li>



<li><strong>AWS might have given them a good deal </strong>versus a colo, since Aquis doesn’t command the same sway someone like NYSE does to bless Equinix with a <s>cash cow</s> dairy farm.</li>



<li><strong>The UK is an HFT-hostile country</strong> (due to share trading taxes) where most UK ULL trading is on swaps and CFDs anyways, so they have little to lose by angering the HFTs by levelling the playing field.</li>
</ol>

<p>In a major clean energy benchmark, wind, solar, and hydro exceeded 100% of demand on California’s main grid for 30 of the past 38 days.</p>



<p>Stanford University professor of civil and environmental engineering Mark Z. Jacobson has been tracking California’s renewables performance, and he shares his findings on Twitter (X) when the state breaks records. Yesterday he posted:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Jacobson notes that supply exceeds demand for “0.25-6 h per day,” and that’s an important fact. The continuity lies not in renewables running the grid for the entire day but in the fact that it’s happening on a consistent daily basis, which has never been achieved before.</p>



<p>At the two-week record mark, Ian Magruder at Rewiring America made this great point <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ianmagruder_this-is-getting-so-easy-its-almost-boring-activity-7176053666829762561-3UgW/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">on LinkedIn</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>And what makes it even better is that California has the largest grid-connected battery storage facility in the world (<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/01/25/us-largest-solar-battery-storage-project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">came online in January</a> …), meaning those batteries were filling up with excess energy from the sun all afternoon today and are now deploying as we speak to offset a good chunk of the methane gas generation that California still uses overnight.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On April 2, the California Independent System Operator (ISO) recommended 26 new transmission projects worth $6.1 billion, with a big number being devoted to offshore wind.</p>




	<p>In response, Jacobson predicted <a href="https://twitter.com/mzjacobson/status/1775902563310899254">on April 4</a> that California will entirely be on renewables and battery storage 24/7 by 2035. </p>



<p>California passed a law that commits to achieving 100% net zero electricity by 2045. Will it beat that goal by a decade? We hope so. It’s going to be exciting to watch.</p>

<p dir="auto">This is the latest version of the Descent 3 source code. This includes the '1.5' patch that Jeff Slutter and Kevin Bentley several years ago. At the time, it worked for Windows, Linux, and Mac.</p>
<p dir="auto">Some proprietary sound and video libraries from Interplay have been stripped out (the ACM and MVE format). I have that code if someone wants to help make a converter so the old cutscenes work. It'll take some effort to stub out that code so it compiles.</p>
<p dir="auto">The first thing I want to do is get everything compiling again, and ideally some CI/CD actions. After that, the code needs to be cleaned up some, to remove old version control comments, etc. A lot of this code was written by a really great team, but keep in mind we were much younger and less experienced back then.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you're interested in helping maintain it, please send me a message. Otherwise, I'm happy to take pull requests.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is the last update I put out there showing different architectures playing along. Yikes, that was a long time ago, sorry we never released a 1.5 patch. Some logistics got in the way!</p>

<h2>A Curious Phenomenon Called ‘Etak’</h2>



<p>Every once in a while, a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything. Or so said Steve Jobs when he announced iPhone in 2007.</p>



<p>But I’m talking about a different revolutionary product. A foundational product that forever changed how everyone on this planet gets to where they need to be.  </p>



<p>Today, I’d like to tell you about the Etak Navigator, a truly revolutionary product and the world’s first practical vehicle navigation system.</p>



<p>Here’s a picture of it:</p>

<p>Back in 1985 you used paper maps to navigate, like this one from a Thomas Brother’s map of Los Angeles:</p>

<p>As you can see, the maps weren’t always pretty. By today’s standards it was also supremely difficult and tedious to find locations and even more difficult to work out how to get there.</p>



<p>So, when the Etak Navigator launched, it was like something from the future.</p>

<p>It immediately got tons of press, including the front cover of Popular Science:</p>

<p>Nearly everything about the Etak Navigator had to be conceived from scratch.</p>



<p>Most important was the self contained positioning system. Remember that back in 1985 GPS was not available (see “<a href="https://maphappenings.com/2024/03/14/where-art-thou/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">12 Map Happenings that Rocked our World: Part 8 — Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?</a>“)</p>



<p>Before GPS, navigation systems used a technique called ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_reckoning" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dead reckoning</a>‘. Dead reckoning relied on sensors to determine distance traveled and direction of travel. However, no sensor is perfect. As a result the further you travel the greater the errors build. Pretty quickly you have no idea where you are.</p>



<p>To solve this problem Etak invented ‘augmented dead reckoning’. This used a process to match the position given by the navigation sensors to a topologically correct electronic map. Whenever the vehicle turned you made the assumption that you’re driving on a road. At that point the location could be ‘snapped’ back to the road and the error from the sensors could be reset. This technique was later adopted by all navigation apps and is still in use today. </p>



<p>Like all attempts at building a navigation system before it, without this key invention the Etak Navigator would have failed.</p>



<p>The second key invention was a ‘heading up’, moving map display.  This meant that the vehicle remained at the center of the screen and the map moved and turned under the vehicle. What you saw ahead of you in the windshield was what was displayed on the screen. This proved highly intuitive.</p>



<p>Third: the Etak Navigator was also the first consumer device to introduce the concept of address search, or what the geospatial industry has come to call ‘geocoding’.</p>

<p>Here is a clip from the only video I could find of the Etak Navigator in action:&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As you can see the map moves and turns as the vehicle drives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The buttons on the right control the zoom level which is denoted as the number of miles between the vehicle symbol and the top of the screen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The top of the screen shows the current zoom level, the heading to the destination, the number of miles to the destination as the crow flies, and which way is north.</p>



<p>The address search allowed entry of destination by address, street or intersection.&nbsp;You could also store common locations like home and work.</p>

<p>The Etak Navigator had twelve buttons, six on each side of the screen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These were soft programmed depending on the current function.</p>



<p>In the screen below you can see how street names were entered. Note how any letter or digit could easily be entered with just two button pushes. Also, you only had to enter the first few letters of a street name:</p>

<p>And after that you simply selected the street from a list:</p>

<p>This is the Etak Navigator in navigation mode:</p>

<p>Note that the Etak Navigator did not provide turn-by-turn directions. Instead you simply zoomed out the map to see your destination, shown as a flashing star. As you got closer to the destination you zoomed in revealing more of the local roads. You had to use your own noggin to determine the most appropriate road to take.</p>



<p>The lack of turn-by-turn navigation did not prove to be an issue. I know from much personal experience that the system worked very well!</p>







<h2>Etak Navigator System Details</h2>



<p>There were five key components to the Etak Navigator:</p>

<p>The first was a vector CRT display — similar to what you might find in an oscilloscope.</p>



<p>The navigation app and data were stored on cassette tape. The cassette tape drive was specially developed to read the tape at very high speed. In a music player a cassette tape is read at about 5cm (1 and 7/8″) per second. The cassette tape in an Etak Navigator was read at about 200cm (80″) per second!</p>



<p>There was an electronic compass installed on rear window of the vehicle.</p>



<p>To determine distance traveled and to augment the heading info from the compass, magnetic wheel sensors were installed on the un-driven wheels of the vehicle. This involved sticking special magnetic tape on the inside of the wheels and mounting magnetic sensors on the brake calipers.</p>



<p>Finally there was metal box about the size of a shoe box that contained the CPU and motherboard. This was installed in the trunk.</p>



<p>The cassette tapes stored both the navigation app and the map data. The maps were called “Etak Maps”. It took 6 tapes to cover the San Francisco Bay Area:</p>

<p>The original price for the Etak Navigator was US$1,395:</p>

<p>That’s the equivalent of about US$4,000 today.</p>



<p>On top of the cost of the Navigator there was an expensive installation cost: it took an experienced technician about 4 hours to install the whole system.</p>







<h2>Just Some of the Technical Hurdles</h2>



<p>Back in 1985 there were huge technical constraints.</p>



<p>GPS barely existed. In those days the government prevented anyone but the military getting more than 100 meter accuracy. And GPS receivers were both large and expensive.</p>



<p>In addition there were no large capacity interchangeable media. Floppy disks couldn’t store enough information and CD-ROM technology was brand new and too costly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The most important problem to solve was overcoming inertial navigation error from the wheel sensors and the compass.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here the solution was topological map matching.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This invention, above all others, made the product viable.</p>

<p>Another issue was data storage and latency.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The cassette tapes only held 3.5 megabytes and had 10 second average seek times.</p>



<p>The dev team had to invent a way of storing the 2D map on a one dimensional medium, making sure that regions close by on the map were also close by on the tape.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Years later, when hard drives became cheaper and CD-ROMs became more readily available Etak’s highly efficient map data storage algorithm paid off in spades and resulted in very high performance maps.</p>

<p>Another problem was heat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Users commonly left tapes on their dashboards and obviously dashboards can get very, very hot.</p>



<p>You can see from the tests that not all brands of cassette tape did very well:</p>

<p>However, a brand that worked was finally found. It had a shell made of polycarbonate.</p>



<p>Yet another problem was dealing with inclines.</p>



<p>The map had no elevation information and so if you were traveling up or down a hill errors would be compounded in the system as the distance traveled on the road was not equal to the distance traveled on the map.</p>



<p>To compensate we therefore needed to know the slope of the hill. To compute this Etak’s lead hardware engineer invented a special inclinometer that used fluid and a capacitive sensor. In tests on various fluids he found that Tequila worked quite well!</p>

<p>Another problem were magnetic anomalies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bridges can be highly magnetic and can really throw off a compass.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The positioning algorithm therefore had to recognize these anomalies. When an anomaly was detected the positioning instead relied on the different speeds of the wheels to determine changes in direction. It wasn’t quite machine learning, but at the time it seemed pretty close!</p>



<p>The system also had to compensate for the magnetic fields generated by the rear window defroster.</p>

<p>In 1985 there wasn’t the luxury of 25 billion transistors and an M3 chip.</p>



<p>Instead the system relied on an Intel 8088 CPU which had 8-bits, ran at 5MHz and only had 29,000 transistors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thus every line of code had to be incredibly efficient. It was all written in C, except for key parts of the OS kernel which were written in assembly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What about the digital map?</p>



<p>Etak had to create it — more or less from scratch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Originally Etak thought it could get maps from the government. Back then the US Census Bureau had something called <a href="https://www.census.gov/history/www/innovations/technology/dual_independent_map_encoding.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GBF DIME files</a> (which predated <a href="https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TIGER</a>). But they were stick maps and didn’t contain any shape to the roads.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Etak therefore embarked on a massive program to build a map of key metropolitan areas across the US and later in Europe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To reposition the GBF/DIME files and give them some shape we used 1:24,000 scale United States Geological Survey quadrangle maps, otherwise knowns as ‘USGS quads’ as a reference.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each map was photographed onto 10” transparencies and then scanned using a very expensive drum scanner.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The entire map production program was developed and ran on a single VAX minicomputer.&nbsp;This blazing machine had 2MB RAM and two 400MB hard drives. It cost about US$120,000 in today’s dollars.</p>



<p>This little devil was burdened with a mammoth set of tasks. It supported:</p>



<ul>
<li>4 map digitizing workstations&nbsp;</li>



<li>The engineers developing and compiling code&nbsp;</li>



<li>Batch jobs to process and compile all the map data&nbsp;</li>



<li>The company admins who used it for word processing</li>
</ul>

<p>A dumb monochrome terminal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You edited code using the ‘vi’ editor. Sometimes you waited an hour for your programs to compile.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The jobs to process the map data took up to two weeks to run … which was longer the the mean time between failure for the VAX mini-computer. The engineers used to joke that they should run the long jobs only immediately after a hardware failure had been fixed (knowing full well they were uttering a statistical fallacy).</p>



<p>The map digitizing environment was also revolutionary:</p>

<p>Each digitizing workstation was comprised of a PC clone with an 8-bit color graphics card and a 19” monitor. Initially there were four workstations which were manned by three shifts a day. Later this grew to 36 workstations. Etak digitized maps 24 hours a day, 5 days a week and 8 hours a day on weekends. </p>



<p>The map editing system was the first ever to use ‘heads up’ digitizing and was a huge trade secret at the time. It was so secret that the methodology was never patented and the digitizing environment was walled off from prying eyes — especially from the CEO of a particular company called ‘<a href="http://www.esri.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Environmental Systems Research Institute</a>‘ — i.e. a gentleman called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Dangermond" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jack Dangermond</a> who I’m sure would have leapt at the chance to borrow the concept. 😉</p>



<p>Before this invention people used to digitize ‘blind’ using digitizing tablets which was highly inefficient and error prone.</p>



<p>Etak’s map production system leveraged the eight bits of the color graphics card very efficiently. 5 bits were used to display the scan of the USGS quad in greyscale and the other 3 bits were used to display the digitized map on top.&nbsp;The system was used to reposition the GBF/DIME files as well as to digitize new roads and edit road attributes like street names and addresses:</p>

<h2>The Amazing Team Behind It</h2>



<p>Etak was founded in 1983 by a truly amazing engineer, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Honey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stan </a><a href="https://computerhistory.org/profile/stan-honey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Honey</a>.</p>



<p>Stan was already a world renown sailor. More importantly he was a world class navigator and had already beaten many sailing records across the Pacific by relying on his navigation skills.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before founding Etak, Stan was a research engineer at <a href="http://sri.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SRI International</a> in Menlo Park, California.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stan has gone on to do many things. His most recent achievement was as the director of technology for the America’s Cup sailing races where he developed a system to track the America’s Cup boats to within 2cm, five times per second!</p>

<p>The original idea for Etak came when Stan Honey and a serial entrepreneur, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolan_Bushnell" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nolan Bushnell</a>, were on a sailing boat together. Nolan had hired Stan to navigate his racing yacht through the 1983 Transpacific Yacht Race, a prestigious sailing event that spanned 2,225 nautical miles of open ocean from Los Angeles to Honolulu.</p>



<p>Nolan was famous for inventing the first video game, Pong, and later for founding Atari.</p>

<p>The story is recounted by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjedwards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Benj Edwards</a> in his fantastic article for Fast Company: “<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3047828/who-needs-gps-the-forgotten-story-of-etaks-amazing-1985-car-navigation-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Who Needs GPS? The  Forgotten Story of Etak’s Amazing 1985 Car Navigation System</a>“:</p>







<blockquote>
<p>[Early one morning Stan and Nolan were on night watch together.] They began brainstorming about a computer-based navigation system for use on land. Stan thought a navigation system for automobiles could operate based on dead reckoning and comparing one’s current location to known points on a map, a technique known as map matching. It wouldn’t need satellites at all, just a good digital map, a good compass, and some sensors. Then it could display the result on an electronic screen.</p>



<p>Nolan reaction:&nbsp; “Yeah, let’s do that and I’ll fund it”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Nolan always had an appreciation for where consumer technology might eventually go. In an interview for Inc. magazine in 1984 he said “Let’s say you’re in your car, and you want to go to dinner. You’ve got this box on the dash. You punch in ‘Japanese,’ then ‘cheap,’ then ‘good sushi.’ The box takes over and guides you to a place.”  </p>



<p>One of Etak’s key hires was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marv-white-99945114/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marv White</a>. Marv was a map scientist and mathematician and worked at the US Census Bureau on their mapping program.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Under Marv’s direction Etak’s map digitizing productivity was three times the industry standard.&nbsp;Since leaving Etak, Marv has gone on to many exciting ventures, including a period as Chief Technologist for Innovation at ESPN.</p>

<p>There were many other supremely talented engineers behind the Navigator, many of whom previously worked at SRI International: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ken-milnes-6206356/">Ken Milnes</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/george-loughmiller-9a09a95/">George Loughmiller</a> and Alan Philips to name a few. </p>



<p>Many of the original hires at Etak went on to other mapping organizations, including yours truly. When I worked on the Apple Maps team, 12 of my colleagues were Etak alumni.</p>

<h2>So What Happened to Etak?</h2>



<p>The Etak Navigator was about 20 years ahead of its time. Due to the cost of the hardware and the expensive installation process building a sustainable business proved to be very difficult (sound familiar?)</p>



<p>Instead Etak quickly pivoted. It licensed the navigation code to the biggest automotive OEM hardware manufacturers at the time: Robert Bosch in Germany, GM in the USA and Clarion in Japan. In turn these companies developed their own navigation systems and, many years later, the concept of a ‘Personal Navigation Device’ from the likes of Blaupunkt, Garmin, Magellan, TomTom and many others was born.</p>



<p>During the course of doing business Etak attracted the attention of a perhaps an unusual suitor: Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation. It was News Corps’ <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/apr/07/pressandpublishing.guardianobituaries" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">John B. Evans</a> that saw the potential. </p>



<p>Like Nolan Bushnell, John was a supreme visionary. You would often find him on the same platforms as Intel’s Andy Grove, Bill Gates and other technology megastars. Albert Scardino and Matt Falloon recount the story in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/apr/07/pressandpublishing.guardianobituaries" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">John’s obituary in the Guardian</a>:</p>







<blockquote>
<p>The defining deal of [John’s] career came in the mid-1980s. In 1985, Murdoch invested $350m in a group of travel publications and directories. With one hand, Evans took over the consumer magazine division of Murdoch’s US organisation, including TV Guide, Elle and one he himself invented, Automobile. With his other hand, he launched a secret project in a suburban office building to develop a part of the travel group, the Hotel and Travel Index, into a new media product, codenamed Jaguar.</p>



<p>In the days before streaming video and large file capacity on the internet, travellers’ views of their hotels and destinations were limited to tourist brochures. Jaguar allowed an electronic visual tour of destinations, complete with views of the hotel room they had booked. Once integrated with major airline booking information and other databases and cross-referencing tools, the system threatened to leapfrog other airline, car and hotel reservation systems.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was thus that John had the vision to use Etak’s maps and technology to benefit the Jaguar system. Thus John convinced Rupert to buy Etak. </p>



<p>Stan Honey recounts the conversations:</p>







<blockquote>
<p>John instantly saw the power of maps in media to change the world of classified ads, yellow pages, travel, and broadly answer the questions of “where is the nearest?” and “how do I get to it?”.&nbsp; Naturally, John and my shared sailing background created an instant group of common friends and experience.&nbsp; I remained close friends with John until he passed away and visited him often.&nbsp; Long after John had left News Corp, whenever I was tee’d up in New York waiting for a weather window for a Transatlantic record attempt under sail, I’d always invite John to come visit the boat, which he found fascinating as the boats were 100 foot monohulls or multihulls.&nbsp; I doubt that Etak would have ever appeared on Murdoch’s radar screen without John Evans’ vision and commitment to his vision, and to Etak.&nbsp; At the time of his decision to buy Etak, Murdoch also asked Barry Diller, who was then running Fox, for his opinion.&nbsp; Barry Diller was hard-nosed and direct in his questions, and had a slightly shorter term vision than did John, but Barry also supported News Corp’s acquisition of Etak, and focus on the maps.</p>



<p>John really was a long-term visionary, as was Nolan Bushnell.&nbsp; During the Etak days, both would visit and “wind-up” the Etak crew with their predictions.&nbsp; That was very helpful as the two of them kept our minds wide open.&nbsp; But it was also helpful that they would mostly stay away because we were burdened with the need to actually get things to work, which visionaries seldom are.&nbsp; It is interesting to note that all of the things that Nolan and John predicted, have happened.&nbsp; It is also interesting to remember how far-fetched they seemed at the time of their visits.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>But the times there are a changin’: as fate would have it in 1989 Murdoch sold the Jaguar system to Reed International for a profit of $500M. With Jaguar sold the relevance of Etak to New Corp lessened. </p>



<p>News Corp subsequently sold Etak to SONY, who then later sold it to Tele Atlas. And still later Tele Atlas was subsumed by TomTom. So what was originally Etak is now <a href="http://tomtom.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TomTom</a>:</p>

<h2>But Why the name ‘Etak’?</h2>



<p>The answer goes back to the early days of Polynesian navigation. In those days the ancient mariners navigated the seas by relying on a series of environmental cues, such as the positions of islands around them.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="2657" data-permalink="https://maphappenings.com/2024/04/11/story-of-etak/etak-navigator-jpg-053/" data-orig-file="https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.053.jpeg" data-orig-size="3840,2160" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="etak-navigator-jpg.053" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.053.jpeg?w=300" data-large-file="https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.053.jpeg?w=1024" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.053.jpeg?w=1024" alt="Polynesian navigators" srcset="https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.053.jpeg?w=1024 1024w, https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.053.jpeg?w=2048 2048w, https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.053.jpeg?w=150 150w, https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.053.jpeg?w=300 300w, https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.053.jpeg?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>They imagined that that their boats were stationary and that the islands moved past them. </p>



<p>In the same way, in the Etak Navigator the vehicle is stationary and it’s the maps that move past the vehicle…</p>



<p>With that in mind, Stan decided to call his company Etak, which is a Polynesian term for moving navigational reference points.</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2>But Wait, There is One More Thing…</h2>



<p>When you look at any consumer mapping app in navigation mode, have you noticed something?</p>



<p>Have you noticed something about the symbol used to denote vehicle location?</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="2610" data-permalink="https://maphappenings.com/2024/04/11/story-of-etak/etak-navigator-jpg-058/" data-orig-file="https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.058.jpeg" data-orig-size="3840,2160" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="etak-navigator-jpg.058" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.058.jpeg?w=300" data-large-file="https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.058.jpeg?w=1024" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.058.jpeg?w=1024" alt="Map navigation symbol in Apple Maps" srcset="https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.058.jpeg?w=1024 1024w, https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.058.jpeg?w=2048 2048w, https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.058.jpeg?w=150 150w, https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.058.jpeg?w=300 300w, https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/etak-navigator-jpg.058.jpeg?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Does it look familiar?  Well, of course it does … </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>So it turns out the symbol used by all navigation apps today is the same one originally invented by Etak.</p>



<p>But why did Etak use that particular symbol?</p>



<p>If you talk to the engineer who wrote the original code, George Loughmiller, he’ll be meek and tell you that it seemed like a good idea at the time. But you have to remember one thing: Etak was incubated by Nolan Bushnell, founder of Atari. And at that time both Etak and Atari were housed in the same office building at 1287 Lawrence Station Road in Sunnyvale, California.</p>



<p>Because Etak used a vector display with limited CPU, George needed a symbol that didn’t burden the very scarce computing resources. He also needed a symbol that was easy to read. A traditional symbol for a car — 🚗 — required too many lines. It also didn’t clearly connote direction. Something simpler was needed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Legend has it that one of Etak’s engineers got to see a pre-release demo of one of Atari’s latest games. And that game was…</p>

<h2>So There You Have It…</h2>



<p>Every once in a while, a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything.</p>



<p>Etak’s many significant inventions included:</p>



<ul>
<li>the world’s first in-vehicle nav system that actually worked</li>



<li>augmented dead reckoning using map matching</li>



<li>moving map heads up display</li>



<li>first use of geocoding in a consumer application</li>



<li>algorithms for highly efficient map data storage and retrieval &nbsp;</li>



<li>heads up digitizing</li>



<li>the world’s first high volume digital map production system</li>



<li>inventor of the universal map navigation symbol</li>
</ul>



<p>I was but <a href="https://maphappenings.files.wordpress.com/2024/04/yours-truly.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a pimply engineer</a> at the time. Little did I know when I joined Etak in 1985 that I was going to be part of such an illustrious team.</p>



<p>My hats off and best wishes to everyone I worked with: it was a privilege, an honor and  an amazing journey. Thank you.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Scientific Research, vital for improving human life, is hindered by its inherent complexity, slow pace, and the need for specialized experts. To enhance its productivity, we propose a ResearchAgent, a large language model-powered research idea writing agent, which automatically generates problems, methods, and experiment designs while iteratively refining them based on scientific literature. Specifically, starting with a core paper as the primary focus to generate ideas, our ResearchAgent is augmented not only with relevant publications through connecting information over an academic graph but also entities retrieved from an entity-centric knowledge store based on their underlying concepts, mined and shared across numerous papers. In addition, mirroring the human approach to iteratively improving ideas with peer discussions, we leverage multiple ReviewingAgents that provide reviews and feedback iteratively. Further, they are instantiated with human preference-aligned large language models whose criteria for evaluation are derived from actual human judgments. We experimentally validate our ResearchAgent on scientific publications across multiple disciplines, showcasing its effectiveness in generating novel, clear, and valid research ideas based on human and model-based evaluation results.
