It's also free, and you can do it on any DNS provider, whereas Load Balancing solutions can get really expensive (even on Cloudflare, which is otherwise very reasonably priced).</p><p>I became obsessed with how it works.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>Opinion</span> If you believe Mark Zuckerberg, Meta's AI large language model (LLM) Llama 3 is open source.</p>
<p>It's not, <a target="_blank" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2024/07/open-source-ai-is-the-path-forward/" rel="nofollow">despite what he says.</a> The <a target="_blank" href="https://opensource.org/" rel="nofollow">Open Source Initiative (OSI)</a> spells it out in the <a target="_blank" href="https://opensource.org/osd" rel="nofollow">Open Source Definition</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.llama.com/llama3/license/" rel="nofollow">Llama 3's license</a>&nbsp;–&nbsp;with clauses on litigation and branding – flunks it on several grounds.</p>
<p>Meta, unfortunately, is far from unique in wanting to claim that some of its software and models are open source. Indeed, the concept has its own name: open washing.&nbsp;</p>

    

<p>This is a deceptive practice in which companies or organizations present their products, services, or processes as "open" when they are not truly open in the spirit of transparency, access to information, participation, and knowledge sharing. This term is modeled after "greenwashing" and was <a target="_blank" href="https://michellethorne.cc/2009/03/openwashing/" rel="nofollow">coined by Michelle Thorne</a>, an internet and climate policy scholar, in 2009.</p>

        


        

<p>With the rise of AI, open washing has become commonplace, as shown in a recent study. Andreas Liesenfeld and Mark Dingemanse of Radboud University's Center for Language Studies <a target="_blank" href="https://techxplore.com/news/2024-07-generative-ai-meta-google-feign.html" rel="nofollow">surveyed</a> 45 text and text-to-image models that claim to be open. The pair found that while a handful of lesser-known LLMs, such as <a target="_blank" href="https://allenai.org/olmo" rel="nofollow">AllenAI's OLMo</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://huggingface.co/bigscience" rel="nofollow">BigScience Workshop + HuggingFace with BloomZ</a> could be considered open, most are not. Would it surprise you to know that according to the <a target="_blank" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3630106.3659005">study</a>, the big-name ones from Google, Meta, and Microsoft aren't? I didn't think so.</p>
<p>But why do companies do this? Once upon a time, companies avoided open source like the plague. Steve Ballmer famously proclaimed in 2001 that "<a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2001/06/02/ballmer_linux_is_a_cancer/">Linux is a cancer</a>," because: "The way the license is written, if you use any open source software, you have to make the rest of your software open source." But that was a long time ago. Today, open source is seen as a good thing. Open washing enables companies to capitalize on the positive perception of open source and open practices without actually committing to them. This can help improve their public image and appeal to consumers who value transparency and openness.</p>

        

<p>Some corporations use open washing to shield their models and practices from scientific and regulatory scrutiny while benefiting from the "open" label.</p>
<p>Another major factor is that the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/07/31/eu_ai_act/">EU AI Act</a> provides special exemptions for "open source" models. This creates a powerful incentive for open washing: if their models count as open, they'll have far less restrictive requirements. That, in turn, means they'll need less money to meet regulatory requirements or have to clean their datasets of copyright and other intellectual property (IP) issues.</p>
<p>However, the EU still doesn't have a clear definition of open source AI. In all fairness, no one does yet. The OSI will release its <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/14/opinion_column_osi/">open source AI definition</a> in the next few days. That said, the current crop of open washing licenses fail by anyone's definition – other than their creators.</p>

        

<p>That's not to say all the big-name AI companies are lying about their open source street cred. For example, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ibm-doubles-down-on-open-source-ai-with-new-granite-3-0-models/" rel="nofollow">IBM's Granite 3.0 LLMs</a> really are open source under the Apache 2 license.</p>
<p>Why is this important? Why do people like me insist that we properly use the term open source? It's not like, after all, the OSI is a government or regulatory organization. It's not. It's just a nonprofit that has created some very useful guidelines.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/20/opinion_column_winamp/">WinAmp's woes will pass, but its wonders will be here forever</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/17/opinion_column_elon_musk/">Elon Musk's disaster relief promises: Should we believe the hype?</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/08/23/cockroachdb_opinion/">CockroachDB scurries off to proprietary software land</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As Dan Lorenc, CEO of security company <a target="_blank" href="https://www.chainguard.dev/" rel="nofollow">Chainguard</a>, said in his keynote speech at the <a target="_blank" href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/soss-fusion/" rel="nofollow">Secure Open Source Software (SOSS) Fusion Conference</a> in Atlanta this week, no one can "force you to use the OSI's definitions." But "fortunately, many people, particularly lawyers, believe in this definition. They trust the work that the OSI does, and they trust and understand the protections that companies are granted when they use these licenses when they meet the open source criteria. That's why we see it showing up in procurement contracts of big companies all over the world."</p>
<p>Open source isn't just a legal and business matter. Open source gives developers the freedom to operate the way they do. Without it, they'll "lose the benefits that we've all grown accustomed to of being able to freely use code without having to know about or care about all the different terms in these licenses."</p>
<p>If we need to check every license for every bit of code, "developers are going to go to legal reviews every time you want to use a new library. Companies are going to be scared to publish things on the internet if they're not clear about the liabilities they're encountering when that source code becomes public."</p>
<p>Lorenc continued: "You might think this is only a big company problem, but it's not. It's a shared problem. Everybody who uses open source is going to be affected by this. It could cause entire projects to stop working. Security bugs aren't going to get fixed. Maintenance is going to get a lot harder. We must act together to preserve and defend the definition of open source. Otherwise, the lawyers are going to have to come back. No one wants the lawyers to come back."</p>
<p>I must add that I know a lot of IP lawyers. They do not need or want these headaches. Real open source licenses make life easier for everyone: businesses, programmers, and lawyers. Introducing "open except for someone who might compete with us" or "open except for someone who might deploy the code on a cloud" is just asking for trouble.</p>
<p>In the end, open washing will dirty the legal, business, and development work for everyone. Including, ironically, the shortsighted companies now supporting this approach. After all, almost all their work, especially in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-open-source-is-the-cradle-of-artificial-intelligence/" rel="nofollow">AI</a>, is ultimately based on open source. ®</p>

<p>A Google engineer presented a proposal to the official standardization committee that would split JavaScript into two languages, a core to be implemented by runtime engines and a more capable variant which depends on tools that compile it down to that core.</p>



<p>The presentation was at a <a href="https://github.com/tc39/agendas/blob/main/2024/10.md#agenda-items">meeting</a> of Emca TC39 earlier this month, TC39 [https://tc39.es] being the committee of Ecma International that evolves the JavaScript (officially ECMAScript) specifiation.</p>



<p>Shu-yu Guo, a staff software engineer at Google who specializes in JITs, VMs, compilers and standardization, made the presentation, with <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ylROTu3N6MyHzNzWJXQAc7Bo1O0FHO3lNKfQMfPOA4o">slides</a> that were co-authored by Guo along with others from Mozilla, Apple, Moddable and Sony. Moddable is a company which offers an <a href="https://github.com/Moddable-OpenSource/moddable">open source SDK</a> for embedded programming, including the XS JavaScript engine.</p>



<p>The authors argue that new language features have a mostly negative impact on users. New features “almost always” worsen security, performance is “neutral to negatively impacted,” stability is sometimes worse, and app features are only improved if developers use what is new.</p>



<p>JavaScript VMs (virtual machines), they say, are “already very complex because of pressure to be fast,” which compromises security, and “feels especially bad” when new features do not get adoption. They cite species, where the MDN web reference for JavaScript <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol/species#browser_compatibility">already reports</a> that “engine implementers are investigating whether to remove this feature,” and BigInt, for large numeric values. Regarding BigInt, the presentation states that “use cases never materialized.”</p><!-- FALCON via Article Inline Ad -->
            



<p>The foundational technology of JavaScript should be simple, according to the proposal, because security flaws and the “complexity cost” of the runtimes affects billions of uses, whereas the benefits are restricted to developers and applications that actually use that complexity to advantage.</p>



<p>Despite the multiple organizations involved, the initiative seems to be driven by Google to some extent, and one of the slides contains a disclaimer that “this possible solution is Google’s preferred solution, not necessarily other implementers’”</p>

<p>The proposed solution is not to backtrack on existing features, including new ones where proposals are at a late stage, but to change the future approach to one where most new features are implemented in tooling rather than in the JavaScript engines. The language implemented by the engines is called “JS0” while the language implemented by the tooling is “JSSugar”; these names are used to enable discussion and not intended as final.</p>



<p>The tooling idea is particularly appropriate for JavaScript since many developers actually code in TypeScript and rely on compilers such as Babel, Webpack or the TypeScript compiler to output JavaScript. From the developer perspective, JavaScript is JSSugar, but the runtime engines need only implement JS0. The implication is that there should be more standards compliance among tools.</p>



<p>If adopted, the proposal would mean that future syntax features go into JSSugar, and only API and capability features go into JS0. Compliant engines would only need to support JS0. The burden would shift to tool implementers to support JSSugar, and a side-effect would be that tool implementers would need to be more involved in the standards process and perhaps form a new technical group.</p>



<p>The proposal is already controversial. “Please don’t grant official status to the current crop of JavaScript tooling … many JavaScript developers, myself included, would like to rely less on these tools,” <a href="https://caolan.uk/notes/2024-10-14_js0_jssugar.cm">said one</a>.</p>



<p>There is widespread agreement that prioritizing security, performance and stability is a good thing, but the notion of making JavaScript dependent on intermediate tooling is not popular. “RIP Vanilla JS” <a href="https://x.com/nullvoxpopuli/status/1842389777674314081">said</a> another developer.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	   
<p><img alt="New Windows Driver Signature bypass allows kernel rootkit installs" height="900" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/hl-images/2024/10/02/Windows_11_headpic.jpg" width="1600"></p>

<p>Attackers can downgrade Windows kernel components to bypass security features such as Driver Signature Enforcement and deploy rootkits on fully patched systems.</p>

<p>This is possible by taking control of the Windows Update process to introduce outdated, vulnerable software components on an up-to-date machine without the operating system changing the fully patched status.</p>

<h3>Downgrading Windows</h3>

<p>SafeBreach security researcher Alon Leviev reported the update takeover issue but&nbsp;Microsoft dismissed it saying that it did not cross a defined security boundary, although was possible by gaining kernel code execution as an administrator.</p>

<p>Leviev&nbsp;at the <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/us-24/briefings/schedule/#windows-downdate-downgrade-attacks-using-windows-updates-38963" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">BlackHat</a> and <a href="https://defcon.org/html/defcon-32/dc-32-speakers.html#54522" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">DEFCON</a> security conferences this year demonstrated that the attack was feasible&nbsp;but the problem remains unfixed, leaving open the door for downgrade/version-rollback attacks.</p>

<p>The researcher published a tool called <a href="https://github.com/SafeBreach-Labs/WindowsDowndate" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Windows Downdate</a>, which allows creating custom downgrades and expose a seemingly fully update&nbsp;target system to already fixed vulnerabilities via outdated components, such as DLLs, drivers, and the NT kernel.</p>

<p>"I was able to make a fully patched Windows machine susceptible to past vulnerabilities, turning fixed vulnerabilities unfixed and making the term “fully patched” meaningless on any Windows machine in the world" -&nbsp;<a href="https://www.safebreach.com/blog/update-on-windows-downdate-downgrade-attacks/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Alon Leviev</a></p>

<p>Despite kernel security improving significantly over the years, Leviev managed to bypass the&nbsp;Driver Signature Enforcement (DSE) feature, showing how&nbsp;an attacker could load unsigned kernel drivers to deploy&nbsp;rootkit malware that disables security controls and hides activity that could lead to detecting the compromise.</p>

<p>“In recent years, significant enhancements have been implemented to strengthen the security of the kernel, even under the assumption that it could be compromised with Administrator privileges,” Leviev says.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While the new protections make it more difficult to compromise the kernel, "the ability to downgrade components that reside in the kernel makes things much simpler for attackers," the researcher explains.</p>

<p>Leviev&nbsp;named his exploitation method&nbsp;<em>"ItsNotASecurityBoundary" DSE bypass</em>&nbsp;as it is part of the&nbsp;<strong>false file immutablity flaws</strong>, a new vulnerability class in Windows&nbsp;described in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.elastic.co/security-labs/false-file-immutability" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">research from Gabriel Landau</a> of Elastic as a way to&nbsp;achieve arbitrary code execution with kernel privileges.</p>

<p>Following Landau's report, Microsoft patched the ItsNotASecurityBoundary admin-to-kernel privilege escalation. However, this does protect against a downgrade attack.</p>

<h3>Targeting the kernel</h3>

<p>In new research published today, Leviev shows how an attacker could exploit the Windows Update process to bypass DSE protections by downgrading a patched component, even on fully updated Windows 11 systems.</p>

<p>The attack is possible by replacing ‘ci.dll,’ a file responsible for enforcing DSE, with an unpatched version that ignores driver signatures, which essentially sidesteps Windows’ protective checks.</p>

<p>This replacement is triggered by the Windows Update, exploiting a double-read condition where the vulnerable ci.dll copy is loaded into memory right after Windows starts checking the latest copy of ci.dll.</p>

<div>

<p>This “race window” allows the vulnerable ci.dll to load while Windows thinks it has verified the file, hence allowing unsigned drivers to be loaded onto the kernel.</p>

<p>In the video below, the researcher demonstrates how he reverted the DSE patch via a downgrade attack and then exploited the component on a fully patched Windows 11 23H2 machine.</p>

<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" mozallowfullscreen="" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1023363712" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Leviev also describes methods to disable or bypass Microsoft's Virtualization-based Security (VBS) that creates an isolated environment for Windows to protect essential resources and securtiy assets like the secure kernel code integrity mechanism (<em>skci.dll</em>)&nbsp;and authenticated user credentials.</p>

<p>VBS typically relies on protections like UEFI locks and registry configurations to prevent unauthorized changes, but it can be disabled if not configured with max security (“Mandatory” flag) by performing targeted registry key modification.</p>

<p>When partially enabled, key VBS files such as ‘SecureKernel.exe’ can be replaced with corrupt&nbsp;versions that disrupt VBS’s operation and open the way for “ItsNotASecurityBoundary” bypass and to replace 'ci.dll'.</p>

<div>
<figure><img alt="Ignoring the VBS configuration during boot" height="131" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/u/1220909/2024/Campaigns/29/vbs.png" width="774"><figcaption><strong>Ignoring the VBS configuration during boot</strong><br><em>Source: SafeBreach</em></figcaption></figure></div>

<p>Leviev’s work shows that downgrade attacks are still possible via several pathways, even if they sometimes carry strong privilege prerequisites.</p>

<p>The researcher highlights the need for endpoint security tools to closely monitor downgrade procedures, even those that do not cross critical security boundaries.</p>

              <p><span>Most of the world’s video games from close to 50 years of history are effectively, legally dead. A&nbsp;</span><span>Video Games History Foundation study found&nbsp;<a href="https://gizmodo.com/9-out-of-10-classic-video-games-are-unavailable-study-1850623505" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you can’t buy nearly</a></span><a href="https://gizmodo.com/9-out-of-10-classic-video-games-are-unavailable-study-1850623505"><span>&nbsp;90% of games</span></a><span> from before 2010. Preservationists have been looking for ways to allow people to legally access gaming history, but the U.S. Copyright Office dealt them a heavy blow Friday. Feds declared that you or any researcher has no right to access old games under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or DMCA.</span></p> <p><span>Groups like the VGHF and the Software Preservation Network have been putting their weight behind an exemption to the DMCA surrounding video game access. The law says that you can’t remotely access old, defunct games that are still under copyright without a license, even though they’re not available for purchase. Current rules in the DMCA restrict libraries and repositories of old games to one person at a time, in person.</span></p> <p><span>The foundation’s proposed exemption would have allowed more than one person at a time to access the content stored in museums, archives, and libraries. This would allow players to access a piece of video game history like they would if they checked out an ebook from a library. The VGHF and SPN argued that if the museum has several copies of a game in its possession, then it should be able to allow as many people to access the game as there are copies available.</span></p>

 <p><span>In the Copyright Office’s </span><a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2024-24563.pdf"><span>decision</span></a><span> dated Oct. 18 (found on Page 30), Director Shira Perlmutter agreed with multiple industry groups, including the Entertainment Software Association. She recommended the Library of Congress keep the same restrictions. </span><a href="https://www.copyright.gov/1201/2018/"><span>Section 1201</span></a><span> of the DMCA restricts “unauthorized” access to copyrighted works, including games. However, it allows the Library of Congress to allow some classes of people to circumvent those restrictions.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/tuGsUZMrcp">https://t.co/tuGsUZMrcp</a> <a href="https://t.co/AyPu072rrY">pic.twitter.com/AyPu072rrY</a></p> <p>— Video Game History Foundation (@GameHistoryOrg) <a href="https://twitter.com/GameHistoryOrg/status/1849867129828540769?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 25, 2024</a></p></blockquote> 

 <p>In a <a href="https://gamehistory.org/dmca-2024-statement/">statement</a>, the VGHF said lobbying efforts from rightsholders “continue to hold back progress.”&nbsp;The group pointed to comments from a representative from the ESA. An attorney for the ESA told&nbsp;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/can-an-online-library-of-classic-video-games-ever-be-legal/">Ars Technica</a>, “I don’t think there is at the moment any combinations of limitations that ESA members would support to provide remote access.”</p> <p><span>Video game preservationists </span><a href="https://www.copyright.gov/1201/2024/2024_Section_1201_Registers_Recommendation.pdf"><span>said</span></a><span> these game repositories could provide full-screen popups of copyright notices to anybody who checked out a game. They would also restrict access to a time limit or force users to access via “technological controls,” like a purpose-built distribution of streaming platforms.</span></p>

 <p><span>Industry groups argued that those museums didn’t have “appropriate safeguards” to prevent users from distributing the games once they had them in hand. They also argued that there’s a “substantial market” for older or classic games, and a new, free library to access games would “jeopardize” this market. Perlmutter agreed with the industry groups.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“While the Register appreciates that proponents have suggested broad safeguards that could deter recreational uses of video games in some cases, she believes that such requirements are not specific enough to conclude that they would prevent market harms,” she wrote.</span></p>

 <p><span>Do libraries that lend books hurt the literary industry? In many cases, publishers see libraries as free advertising for their products. It creates word of mouth, and since libraries only have a limited number of copies, those who want a book to read for longer are incentivized to purchase one. The video game industry is so effective at shooting itself in the foot that it doesn’t even recognize when third-party preservationists are actively about to help them for no cost on the publishers’ part.</span></p> <p><span>If there is such a substantial market for classic games, why are so many still unavailable for purchase? Players will inevitably turn to piracy or emulation if there’s no easy-to-access way of playing older games.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“The game industry’s absolutist position… forces researchers to explore extra-legal methods to access the vast majority of out-of-print video games that are otherwise unavailable,” the VGHF wrote.</span></p>

    <h2>Adventures in Algorithmic Trading on the Runescape Grand Exchange</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
      Runescape has been a game near and dear to my heart since I was a child. Though I do not actively 
      play anymore, it still functions as an interesting programming project substrate. 
      Most recently, I created a bot that automatically executes trades on the Grand Exchange in order to 
      conduct market making via common machine learning techniques. This blog post will explain the individual 
      components of the bot, the various trading algorithms used, and the results of an experiment comparing 
      the various trading algorithms' performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Old School Runescape Grand Exchange is a market where all players can place buy or sell offers 
      for almost any item in the game. It is a chaotic system like most markets, but it is also modelable 
      on small enough time scales or microstructures. The only constraint placed on offers is a four hour 
      buy limit that is different for each item. For example, coal ore has a buy limit of 13,000. This means that a player 
      can only buy up to 13,000 coal every four hours. Another interesting feature of the Grand Exchange is 
      the 1% tax applied to all executed sell offers. This tax is applied to all items with an individual 
      trading price greater than 100 gold. It is capped at 5 million gold per offer and is applied on a 
      per-item basis rounded down to the nearest integer. The proceeds of the tax are used by the game 
      developer to control inflation.  As an example, if I were to sell 10,000 coal ore at today's price 
      of 142 gold per item, then my executed trade would be subject to a tax of: <code>math.floor(0.01 * 142) * 10000 = 10,000 gold</code>
    </p>
    <h3>Components</h3>
    <p>
      The bot is composed of three separate applications: a JavaScript API to interact with the OSRS Wiki's 
      real-time item price stream, a Java client to control character actions, and a Python API to return the 
      ranking of a set of possible offers in terms of their forecasted profitability. The OSRS Wiki project 
      maintains <a target="_blank" href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/RuneScape:Real-time_Prices">a useful API</a> that, 
      every 5 minutes, writes data about every single item trading on the Grand Exchange. It records fields such 
      as the average item price spread over a configurable past period, the volume traded over a configurable past 
      period, and the buy limit of each item.
    </p>
    <p>
      The data pipeline I use to train the ML models is composed of two cronjobs that interact with the 
      OSRS Wiki API: one that polls it every 5 minutes, and another that polls it every hour. Each of them record 
      the price spreads and volumes of every item traded on the Grand Exchange over that time period and write the 
      resulting data to a database. Furthermore, the bot records data about each offer that it successfully executes. 
      The fields it records are: gold/second generated, absolute profit generated, timestamp of the buy offer 
      initialization, and the ID of the item traded. These two tables are joined on timestamp such that each row 
      contains aggregate trade data of the item across the entire Grand Exchange for the period leading up to 
      a successful trade as well as the profitability of the individual executed trade. The target of the model's 
      loss function is gold/second generated. Lastly, to prevent temporal leakage, the training set consists of 
      labeled trades from 63 days prior to 14 days prior, while the validation set includes the most recent 14 days.
    </p>
    <h3>Baseline Method</h3>
    <p>
      In any modeling scenario, it is always good practice to establish a naive baseline method that can be 
      used to determine if non-trivial methods are actually improving performance. The baseline method I came 
      up with is as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      Given an item, its price spread over the last 5 mins, and its trade volume over the last hour, compute 
      the following variables:
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>ROI:</b>
      <code>(sell_total - {1% tax} - buy_total) / buy_total</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Volume ratio:</b>
      <code>(1h_volume_traded_high_price / 1h_volume_traded_low_price)</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Average gold/second of item trades over last two weeks</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Then do the following:
      </p><ol>
        <li>Compute ROI Z score for each item.</li>
        <li>Compute volume ratio Z score for each item.</li>
        <li>Filter out any items with a historically negative average gold/second metric.</li>
        <li>Sort each item by <code>(roi_zscore + volume_ratio_zscore)</code> descending.</li>
      </ol>
    
    <h3>Machine Learning Methods</h3>
    <p>
      After generating results for the baseline method, I ran a one-week experiment comparing the baseline 
      to <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rhodesrt/ML_exercises/blob/main/random_forest/random_forest.ipynb">random forest</a> 
      and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rhodesrt/ML_exercises/blob/main/random_forest/neural_net.ipynb">neural network</a> 
      regression models. In order to avoid a sample ratio mismatch, I 
      programmed the game client to choose randomly between each model type's output when ranking potential offers. 
      The results are displayed in the following table sorted by mean profit/hour in 
      descending order:
    </p>
    <table>
      <thead>
          <tr>
              <th>Model Type</th>
              <th>n</th>
              <th>L2 loss</th>
              <th>Mean profit/hr</th>
              <th>95% CI profit/hr</th>
          </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
          <tr>
              <td>random forest</td>
              <td>257</td>
              <td>53</td>
              <td>150,892</td>
              <td>129,140 - 172,643</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
              <td>neural network</td>
              <td>191</td>
              <td>57</td>
              <td>123,923</td>
              <td>103,279 - 144,566</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
              <td>baseline</td>
              <td>216</td>
              <td>N/A</td>
              <td>87,353</td>
              <td>79,493 - 95,212</td>
          </tr>
      </tbody>
  </table>
  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>
    Machine learning methods outperformed baseline by a significant amount. Among ML model architectures, random 
    forest performed the best, edging out the neural network slightly. This aligns with the validation loss of each 
    model during training. I am somewhat surprised that the random forest generated the highest profit/hour, as 
    random forest predictions are typically constrained to the range of target values in the training data. With 
    that said, the training data does have relatively low variance as the market making trades these models are 
    predicting tend to be high frequency and low ROI.

<p>The <a href="https://opensource.org/">Open Source Initiative</a>
(OSI) has been working on defining <a href="https://opensource.org/ai">Open Source AI</a>—that is what
constitutes an AI system that can be used, studied, modified, and
shared for any purpose—for almost two
years. Its <a href="https://opensource.org/about/board-of-directors">board</a> will
be voting on the <a href="https://opensource.org/ai/drafts/the-open-source-ai-definition-1-0-rc2">Open Source AI Definition</a> (OSAID) on Sunday,
October&nbsp;27, with the 1.0 version slated to be published on
October&nbsp;28. It is never possible to please <em>everyone</em> in
such an endeavor, and it would be folly to make that a goal. However,
a number of prominent figures in the open-source community have voiced
concerns that OSI is setting the bar too low with the OSAID—which
will undo decades of community work to cajole vendors into adhering to
or respecting the original <a href="https://opensource.org/osd">Open Source
Definition</a> (OSD).</p>

<h4>Defining Open&nbsp;Source&nbsp;AI</h4>

<p>OSI executive director Stefano Maffulli <a href="https://opensource.org/blog/now-is-the-time-to-define-open-source-ai">announced</a>
the organization's intent to provide a definition for open-source AI
in June&nbsp;2023. He took exception to announcements of 
"<q>large language models, foundational models, tooling, services all
claiming to be 'open' or 'Open Source'</q>", while adding restrictions
which run afoul of the OSD. A <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/open-source-llm-not-open">survey</a>
of large-language model (LLM) systems in 2023 found that ostensibly
open-source LLMs did not live up to the name.</p>

<p>The problem is not quite as simple as saying "use an OSD-compliant
license" for LLMs, because there are many more components to
consider. The original OSD is understood to apply to the
source code of a program in "<q>the preferred form in which a
programmer would modify the program</q>". A program is not considered
open source if a developer cannot study, use, modify, and share a
program, and a license is not OSD‑compliant if it does not
preserve those freedoms. A program can include non-free data and still
be open source. For example, the game <a href="https://github.com/id-Software/Quake-III-Arena">Quake&nbsp;III&nbsp;Arena</a>
(Q3A) is available under the GPLv2. That distribution, however, does
not include the <a href="https://quakewiki.org/wiki/.pak">pak</a>
files that contain the maps, textures, and other content required to
actually play the commercial game. Despite that, others can still use
the Q3A code to create their own games, such as <a href="https://tremulous.net/">Tremulous</a>.</p>

<!-- middle-ad -->

<p>When discussing an "AI system", however, things are much more
complicated. There is more than just the code that is used to run the
models to do work of some kind, and the data is not something that
can be wholly separate from the system in the way that it can be with a
game. When looking at, say, LLMs, there is the model architecture, the
code used to train models, model parameters, the techniques and methodologies used for
training, the procedures for labeling training data, the supporting
libraries, and (of course) the data used to train the models.</p>

<p>OSI has been working on its definition since last year. It held a kickoff meeting on June&nbsp;21, 2023 at the
Mozilla headquarters in San&nbsp;Francisco. It <a href="https://opensource.org/deepdive/#:~:text=How%20to%20participate">invited
participation</a> afterward via a regular series of in-person
and <a href="https://opensource.org/ai/townhalls">online sessions</a>,
and with a <a href="https://discuss.opensource.org/">forum for online
discussions</a>. LWN <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/961868/#:~:text=Stefano%20Maffulli,AI%20system">covered</a>
one of the sessions, held at <a href="https://archive.fosdem.org/2024/">FOSDEM 2024</a>, in
February.</p>

<p>The current draft of the OSAID takes its definition of an AI system from the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/">Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development</a> (OECD) <a href="https://legalinstruments.oecd.org/en/instruments/OECD-LEGAL-0449">Recommendation
of the Council on Artificial Intelligence</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
A machine-based system that, for explicit or implicit objectives,
infers, from the input it receives, how to generate outputs such as
predictions, content, recommendations, or decisions that can influence
physical or virtual environments.
</blockquote>

<p>This includes source code for training and running the system,
model parameters "<q>such as weights or other configuration
settings</q>", as well as "<q>sufficiently detailed information about
the data used to train the system so that a skilled person can build a
substantially equivalent system</q>".</p>

<h4>Preferred form to make modifications</h4>

<p>Those elements must all be available under OSI-approved licenses,
according to the proposed definition, which seems perfectly in line
with what we've come to expect when something is called "open
source". There is an exception, though, for things like the data
information and model parameters which must be available under
"<q>OSI-approved terms</q>". The definition of OSI-approved terms is
not supplied yet.</p>

<p>There is no requirement to make the <em>training data</em> available. To be
compliant with the current draft of the OSAID, an AI system need only
provide "<q>detailed information</q>" about the data but not the data
itself.</p>

<p>The OSI <a href="https://opensource.org/blog/community-input-drives-the-new-draft-of-the-open-source-ai-definition">published</a>
version 0.0.9 on August 22. It acknowledged then that "<q>training data is
one of the most hotly debated parts of the definition</q>". However,
the OSI was choosing not to require training data:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After long deliberation and co-design sessions we have concluded
that defining training data as a benefit, not a requirement, is the
best way to go.</p>

<p>Training data is valuable to study AI systems: to understand the
biases that have been learned, which can impact system behavior. But
training data is not part of the preferred form for making
modifications to an existing AI system. The insights and
correlations in that data have already been learned.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As it stands, some feel that the OSAID falls short of allowing the
four freedoms that it is supposed to ensure. For example, julia
ferraioli <a href="https://www.juliaferraioli.com/blog/2024/on-open-source-ai/">wrote</a>
that without including data, the only things that the OSAID guarantees
are the ability to use and distribute an AI system. "<q>They would be
able to build on top of it, through methods such as transfer learning
and fine-tuning, but that's it.</q>"

</p><p>Tom Callaway has <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-open-data-necessary-source-ai-tom-callaway-stzcc/">written</a>
at length on LinkedIn about why open data should be a requirement. He 
acknowledges that there are good reasons that distributors of an AI
system may not want, or be able, to distribute training data. For
example, the data itself may have a high monetary value on its own,
and a vendor may be unwilling or unable to share it.
Acme Corp might license a data set and
have permission to create an AI system using it, but not the
ability to distribute the data itself. The data might have legal
issues, ranging from confidentiality (e.g., medical data sets) to a
desire to avoid lawsuits from using copyrighted data.</p>

<p>All of those are understandable reasons for not distributing
data with an AI system, he said, but they don't argue for crafting a definition
that allows companies to call their system open:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If we let the Open Source AI definition contain a loophole that
makes data optional, we devalue the meaning of "open source" in all
other contexts. While there are lots of companies who would like to
see open source mean less, I think it's critical that we not
compromise here, even if it means there are less Open Source AI
systems at first.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Objections to lack of training data are more than an attachment to
the original meaning of open source. Giacomo Tesio <a href="https://discuss.opensource.org/t/list-of-unaddressed-issues-of-osaid-rc2/650">posted</a>
a list of issues he considered unaddressed in the RC2 version of
the OSAID, including a claim that there is inherent insecurity due to the
ability to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06974">plant
undetectable backdoors</a> in machine-learning models.</p>

<h4>Others weigh in</h4>

<p>The Free Software Foundation (FSF) <a href="https://www.fsf.org/news/fsf-is-working-on-freedom-in-machine-learning-applications">announced</a>
that it was working on "<q>a statement of criteria for free machine
learning applications</q>" to call something a free (or libre)
machine-learning application. The FSF says that it is close to a
definition, and is working on the exact text. However, it adds that
"<q>we believe that we cannot say a ML application 'is free' unless
all its training data and the related scripts for processing it
respect all users, following the four freedoms</q>".</p>

<p>However, the FSF makes a distinction between non-free and
unethical in this case:</p>

<blockquote>
It may be that some nonfree ML have valid moral reasons for not
releasing training data, such as personal medical data. In that case,
we would describe the application as a whole as nonfree. But using it
could be ethically excusable if it helps you do a specialized job that
is vital for society, such as diagnosing disease or injury.
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/">Software&nbsp;Freedom&nbsp;Conservancy</a>
has <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/news/2024/oct/25/aspirational-on-llm-generative-ai-programming/">announced</a>
an "<q>aspirational statement</q>" about LLM-backed generative AI for
programming called "Machine-Learning-Assisted Programming that
Respects User Freedom". Unlike the OSAID, this target focuses solely
on computer-assisted programming, and was developed <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2022/feb/03/github-copilot-copyleft-gpl/">in
response</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub_Copilot">GitHub
Copilot</a>. The announcement did not directly name the OSI or the OSAID effort, but
said "<q>we have avoided any process that effectively auto-endorses
the problematic practices of companies whose proprietary products are
already widely deployed</q>". It describes an ideal LLM system built
only with FOSS, with all components available, and only for the creation of FOSS.</p>

<h4>Response to criticisms</h4>

<p>I emailed Maffulli about some of the criticisms of the current
OSAID draft, and asked why OSI appears to be "lowering the bar" when
the OSI has never budged on source availability and use
restrictions. He replied:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I'll be blunt: you mention "source redistribution" in your question
and that's what leads people like [Callaway] into a mental trap
[...]</p>

<p>There are some groups believing that more components are required to
guarantee more transparency. Other groups instead believe that model
parameters and architecture are enough to modify AI. The Open Source
AI Definition, developed publicly with a wide variety of stakeholders
worldwide, with deep expertise on building AI (see the <a href="https://opensource.org/ai/endorsements">list of endorsers</a>),
found that while those approaches are legitimate, neither is
optimal. The OSAID grants users the rights (with licenses) and the
tools (with the list of required components) to meaningfully
collaborate and innovate on (and fork, if required) AI systems.  We
have not compromised on our principles: we learned many new things
from actual AI experts along the way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maffulli objected to the idea that the OSAID was weaker or making
concessions, and said that the preferred form for modifying ML systems
was what is in the OSAID: "<q>it's not me nor OSI board saying that,
it's in the list of endorsers and in [Carnegie Mellon University's] <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/engin/programs/about-ofai/cmu-osaid-statement.html">comment</a></q>". He
added that OSI had synthesized input from "<q>AI builders, users, and
deployers, content creators, unions, ethicists, lawyers, software
developers from all over the world</q>" to arrive at the definition. A
"<q>simple translation</q>" of the OSD, he said, would not work.</p>

<p>Stephen O'Grady, founder of the RedMonk analyst firm, also makes
the case that the OSD does not easily translate to AI projects. But he
does not believe that the term open source "<q>can or should be
extended into the AI world</q>" as he <a href="https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2024/10/22/from-open-source-to-ai/">wrote</a>
in a blog post on October&nbsp;22:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At its heart, the current deliberation around an open source
definition for AI is an attempt to drag a term defined over two
decades ago to describe a narrowly defined asset into the present to
instead cover a brand new, far more complicated future set of
artifacts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>O'Grady makes the case that the OSI has set out on a pragmatic path
to define open-source AI, which requires nuance. Open source has
succeeded, in part, because the OSD removes nuance. Does a license
comply with the OSD or doesn't it? It's pretty easy to determine. Less
so with the OSAID. The pragmatic path, he said:

</p><blockquote>
Involves substantial compromise and, more problematically,
requires explanation to be understood. And as the old political adage
advises: "If you're explaining, you're losing."
</blockquote>

<p>It would have been better, he said, if the OSI had not tried to
"<q>bend and reshape a decades old definition</q>" and instead had
tried to craft something from a clean slate. That seems unlikely now,
he said, after two years of trying to "<q>thread the needle between
idealism and capitalism to arrive at an ideologically sound and yet
commercially acceptable</q>" definition.</p>

<p>Indeed, it seems likely that the OSI board will move forward with
the current draft of the OSAID or something close to it. The
impact that will have is much less certain.</p>

<p>Why is there almost nothing on the left hand side of the USA? Water scarcity!</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfsrjxVvYuSx3jqO_GPM8nz9UCu1ren7z8LJxyZseJ9XNJUcqdeN5kzy8KHO5nslDO57mMsTYX_rw62RS3UonQiHrqk_mcYcsrkzdK2Vz1q0jzHMH0TlfxHCDL84Ak5-nsvxMzXse4MGNlAJNE-iYo1Cl-z?key=iCG5M9LCDpdICPDZFbOVOw" alt=""></figure>



<p>We’re missing 300 million Americans. We’re missing&nbsp; 30 global cities west of 100 degrees longitude. We should do something about it!</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXflI4sm6aAyzrY6mQwG6bJNra7GRAW453ukdu2wFTFIyAb90blTrLQ6VkvBVeAbQVlnsYKqSU2u_08OHRpN2Tw6yb-FDPFY4ew4AjwGABhzNrLNY_1gEPYFeqgJGLfJekB1bGkHqPhWFeFav4sdRcFxiSc?key=iCG5M9LCDpdICPDZFbOVOw" alt=""></figure>



<p>The western US is a parched opportunity to create millions of acres of prime land for the next billion Americans to live on. Only one ingredient is missing – water.</p>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadillac_Desert">“Cadillac Desert” (1986)</a> by Marc Reisner correctly pointed out that within the limits of natural precipitation, we’ve expanded habitation in the West close to its maximal extent. Nearly 40 years after he wrote, however, the answer to shrinking flows of the Colorado and ever more demand for living space is not to stage some kind of retreat from land otherwise blessed with climate, solar power potential, mineral and human capital wealth. The answer is to flex our industrial might and finish what the irrigators began a century ago, and bring water in vast quantities to the high desert, to terraform a few select valleys in Nevada, and build a 21st century aesthetic vision.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfUniDpBhI13ToOjDA9kr0lUAhiyW5Z3ZUnaNP7-7sVgOIBe7yZHULZCdgEqfuxj35M_p4FUJci9QsyRfTnZBp-ZYHQrcQB6CBWJiosCVf1AgpOYpmSfLWMQHDdYGSR3qY__x-Fhg_ZcoCm48NGiPACdcLa?key=iCG5M9LCDpdICPDZFbOVOw" alt=""></figure>



<p>We’ve already Terraformed California and Florida. 63 million people live in sparkling prosperous modern metropolises that were formerly uninhabitable swamps, within living memory. How did we do this? Large scale infrastructure projects that moved natural resources, principally water, from one place to another.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXehcP4o29934O9Dow7vQQRsVK1z2hurQfQWLi4AYOGevcNgbE-sP-4VWAtV6gJJg8Zm9zPLcQjMFO-UWyJC9T0pGfvBFlrAzlc8CLzmBvIfz_wfSl6cr_3H_ieCJDn8ICRaLVuTOYd4VEzGToCne6pJ5ss?key=iCG5M9LCDpdICPDZFbOVOw" alt=""></figure>



<p>March 1938 flood in Los Angeles.</p>



<p>In Los Angeles, we channelized the rivers and lowered the water table, creating 284,000 acres on which we’ve built one of the most dynamic cities on Earth. At the same time, we built the LA aqueduct, the Colorado River aqueduct, and the California aqueduct to bring in millions of acre feet of water every year to serve agriculture, homes, and businesses.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfzsj-Ae_7_wV6hS9Mc6tMFFfcmceDgLnqHapU9esW1vXB2rCWGNIAyZt8H_9Wm2W4Hk9rJJ7sMRnokcFMUTdRWATOSDhPRR5ipG3PCicAXEUwvrArdCOrXbqpz8phcAwNnedsh-TgsC2B1kzI2EneYCg?key=iCG5M9LCDpdICPDZFbOVOw" alt=""></figure>



<p>In Florida, a combination of development, drainage, and air conditioning created one of the most desirable cities on Earth from a previously pestilential swamp.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfKTKwn-nsFlkqrLxOhtCDIq_SihxS0Hsjv1BnOELKZAXzo05r8rfW4uieKrr543R0emSkYMq4rFEviS_PgbUBVF1PmdUuJRMCRLZN51bmeXMFfrUojN423susBYjaaI2Evot-tWDrkONPRlDcvFAXrFnew?key=iCG5M9LCDpdICPDZFbOVOw" alt=""></figure>



<p>As a people, we need to ask ourselves whether we have an aesthetic sensibility. Do we need to curate landscapes? Cultivate life? Create beauty? Do we want to continue our historical pattern of striving to build better towns, cities, and opportunities for the coming generation?</p>



<p>My sense is that the answer to these questions is yes, of course, but that water scarcity in the American West blocks the sort of truly ambitious development we would otherwise like to see.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We should solve that problem.</p>



<p>The key to solving water scarcity at the scale necessary to terraform Nevada is not to build bigger dams or to resort to rain dances, but to make more water using solar powered desalination technology.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/2022/11/20/we-need-more-water-than-rain-can-provide-refilling-rivers-with-desalination/">this post two years</a> ago I explained how cheap solar unlocks usefully cheap desalinated water, with current (2024) state-of-the-art plants producing at just $0.40/m^3 – and radical further improvements are within reach.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In <a href="https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/2024/01/09/a-vision-for-the-alleviation-of-water-scarcity-in-the-us-southwest-and-the-revitalization-of-the-salton-sea/">this post a year ago</a> I showed how a desalination project in the Imperial Valley could not only double southern California’s water availability but also jump start an enormous brine mineral extraction industry, convert the Salton Sea environmental catastrophe into a warmer version of Lake Tahoe, and pay for itself in short order.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXf3f2TitV5zultvm8sLNFLkx_wV2RS6qlUq5xO5Pw380DDYtWcPnZ8h0WB7hzGJKh3S_L8GuFkEcD-LCNfmWQAbeB3vztOGxttbVGBgQt0YBrFwPOa_nIyqMywRS0VP6duBFthUDXypbFEkkEd87ywxspza?key=iCG5M9LCDpdICPDZFbOVOw" alt=""></figure>



<p>Both of these posts were based on using solar+batteries+reverse osmosis desalination technology (RO) to produce cheap water – with no technical risk and almost no market risk. I firmly believe regulatory risk is a solvable problem, once the participants in the usual zero sum water disputes realize that there’s an easy path to unconditional future abundance. We can radically expand the pie, everyone can have a big slice!</p>



<p>In the previous posts I baselined solar power at $0.50/W and batteries at $100/kWh, together with RO at $2000/kW. Amortized over 10 years, these systems produce water at around $500/acre-foot, or $0.40/m^3. This is a great price for municipal supply and even for the farming of certain high value cash crops. Indeed, the Federal Government now pays <a href="https://calmatters.org/commentary/2023/06/colorado-river-deal-west-water/">$521/af for water use avoided</a>! Matching California’s annual 5 maf extraction from the Colorado would cost $2.5b per year, a tiny fraction of the economic productivity enabled by this water but a significant premium on the price California pays for the first 5 million acre-feet per year!&nbsp;</p>



<p>We should be able to do better than this. Solar is getting cheaper.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfchRPEqx7a3EsUMsHLcL47TxMzHLZtjXosjLStgNeo8MYNZUAX4A0e5r2Ypw2tUlF5ys-rbW3B6OA3dvQk0SqxIWND1FY1jLkB9rdHGi2jBX6ONHdip0SFTOiydxliIDfUCWee2AZDUDz35rmJ0eSWIoXe?key=iCG5M9LCDpdICPDZFbOVOw" alt=""></figure>



<p>Indeed, solar PV is the first mass produced product where energy is an <em>output </em>rather than an <em>input. </em>We have literally invented a way to produce more and more energy at ever lower prices, which are currently falling at 15-20% per year. Earlier this week, we saw modules changing hands for the <a href="https://x.com/SolarInMASS/status/1848671580424999379">record low price</a> of $0.07/W! Solar modules are commodities, inert slabs of glass that you put on the ground and which spit out wealth. If we can maintain similar cost curves on racking and installation systems, we’re within striking distance of $0.10/W for a large scale array.</p>



<p>At the same time, and for the same reason, batteries have dropped in cost too.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXc-BwE6H81kL2U7k_6mmEjREgzU1tLTFfBstLyPl0XUvc5HKyjY9MgdiwTR0VQNg7BvL_gGZtk8RdtLuYNLjuokeWyACmTv-rxnJU-EL0hK_HCjjWEMVgUBWPeOjAlpvGwZK3WUu5P6zL6kYqeBA8yNxjE?key=iCG5M9LCDpdICPDZFbOVOw" alt=""></figure>



<p>I will have to update this chart too, since earlier this week we saw <a href="https://x.com/sdmoores/status/1849375715961016368">LFP cells changing hands</a> for less than $50/kWh.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Scaling these advances to the Salton-Imperial project, we can cut the cost of the array from $10b to $2b, the battery storage system from $12b to $6b, while the intervening (and rather modest) 5% RO cost reduction brings that part from $10b to $9.5b, for a total of just $17.5b, compared to $32b a year ago. Feeding forward, that reduces water cost to $280/af or $0.22/m^3, cheap enough that you could almost double your irrigation while still cutting legacy extraction to zero and pocketing the $521/af from the feds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the same time, more than half of the residual cost is just the amortized RO system. If we want to go even lower, we’re going to have to adapt to the solar supply curve. <a href="https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/2024/05/22/the-solar-industrial-revolution-is-the-biggest-investment-opportunity-in-history/">In this post earlier this year</a>, I explained how adapting legacy industrial processes for lower capex and intermittency can capture the upside of future solar PV cost reductions more effectively than relying on solar and batteries. As a rough rule of thumb, an even split of capex between the solar array and the application, collocated in some off-grid distributed plant, minimizes product cost for customers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, for a $200k 1 MW solar plant, a $200k desalination plant that operates at 25% utilization and 3 kWh/m^3 produces 7.3 million cubic meters over 10 years at an amortized cost of just $0.055/m^3 or $68/af.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Current RO plants cost more like $2000/kW, so they’re both financially and technically unsuited to intermittent operation, which fatigues their membranes. Thermal desalination could achieve radically lower cost, albeit at lower energy efficiencies, so there’s work to be done here designing new, low cost desalination machines that fully exploit the upside of cheap solar PV.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In particular, a multi-effect distillation apparatus could be produced from injection molded low cost plastics in enormous volumes and at minimum practicable cost. Multi-effect distillation uses a series of heat exchanges to get more distillation bang from the high latent heat of vaporization buck.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcDg8wxxHej2zlfc8TnIw6gAkbHDj_HP5zDUb9_OKDsIHFe13a7sZKCot-m7_Bf_cxz2NdezNyU7nYwkxe2wvkqFA7EwPw6Qa5mWA-eOR4Z3aIa0YvXZbyucglWqc6OGdGQdjFXALwR7UYgpfQRg3MNhKQ?key=iCG5M9LCDpdICPDZFbOVOw" alt=""></figure>



<p>In addition to cheaper desalination, terraforming of the Nevada high desert or similar landscapes will require pumping water uphill. Fortunately, once again solar PV can provide the necessary low cost energy. Pumping one million acre feet of water per year 1000 m uphill requires a 6 GW solar PV array plus the usual low cost, high efficiency water pumps. Pumping water doesn’t involve nasty thermodynamic transitions so is relatively easy to perform. Depending on desalination efficiency, pumping water 1000 m uphill roughly doubles the energy cost, with a lower incremental increase in price due to the relatively low cost of pumps vs desalination equipment.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Let’s Terraform Nevada</strong></p>



<p>Nevada is a fascinating place. 71 million acres, of which 80% is federally managed land. Only three million people, of which almost all live in Las Vegas, a city which depends on the Colorado River for its water. Reno, at the other end of the state, houses just over half a million people. In contrast, Ohio is roughly one third the size and has nearly four times as many people. Unlike Ohio, Nevada receives so little rain that it lacks rivers with significant perennial flow. Water-induced erosion is so minimal that the geological formation of the basin and range geography has fragmented the drainage into a few dozen endorheic basins. In the battle between mountain formation and water erosion, mountain formation is winning handily.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdvg8UZEHXqm024dmA4S5rfwG-q9iTeGgPfrOYEBu3Em9tIVTR7tWvZk-8cXUYzjoygKkCHrJ2bjRtmRZVopqmxg02LgxrlwRTkrseAiUlpupjI5hVILzIh4TK8kPwF2a3atIDTU1e7EgjVAm4Kj9HzLoog?key=iCG5M9LCDpdICPDZFbOVOw" alt=""></figure>

<p>This wasn’t always the case. During the last ice age, only 10,000 years ago, Nevada enjoyed a much wetter climate, with numerous lakes, rivers, forests, and even North American megafauna such as mammoths, mastodons, and giant sloths.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I’m <a href="https://www.makerain.com/">hardly the first</a> to observe that <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2021/11/what-would-a-world-with-very-cheap-energy-look-like.html">cheap energy can radically transform Nevada</a>, so here I’ll try to be more constructive. How do we do this?</p>



<p>We use cheap solar PV and, ideally, cheap desalination technology to generate millions of acre feet of water on the coast. We move the water inland. We release it onto the landscape to substitute for a lack of natural rainfall.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXep5xt2dhdWM9H6y2OYjxUqPRzgbyY84Tqb8Lo_QTsFOw5bDMieM_xjqxMajwzFkK_9M1_WTjmHryERtt7DvKY2vCfNqAmlb2fLtNcWY1YhodYUFFX3w7gzgTcZL9gIV6Vnmo2hNGQki9IR5Q9Sxaz0e3I?key=iCG5M9LCDpdICPDZFbOVOw" alt=""></figure>



<p>Let’s get specific.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First, we have to get fresh desalinated water to Nevada, a landlocked state. There are a number of ways this could be accomplished, depending on aesthetic preferences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By far the simplest and easiest is to swap water desalinated in the Colorado River delta for water otherwise released from Lake Meade, which lies at altitude adjacent to Las Vegas. Five million acre feet per year generated either in Mexico or the US part of the Imperial Valley can feed the All American Canal, the Coachella Canal, and thence the Colorado River Aqueduct. As part of a water deal, Nevada can lease California’s water rights to Colorado River water and divert it on a loop or two through the state before returning flow to the river.</p>



<p>The lower Colorado River has three reservoirs, through which coastal desalinated fresh water could even be pumped uphill to Lake Meade, depending on seasonal demand and compensating for future variability in flows and releases from the Upper Colorado river.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is not the only way to get water to Nevada. The next easiest is to restore the Mojave River, a now dry/underground watercourse that runs from the Cajon Pass near San Bernardino north and east towards Death Valley, ultimately terminating at Badwater. In this case, however, flow would be diverted upstream of the National Park, then pumped up the Amargosa River valley across the border into Nevada.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfUVSAaTHGNRxTaqfbOL6KKWBOYLNhRLdwfss_sM8VPSWQSqK3HtxzB81ea5BrXoeiBxQpz21sWYkWuClqXbrB4-ZIC68CQPLhh0lT54Fmo07Jii4KFnrKuOzcYGue4UAKwxCWe75wI6F_onm5PwcwgqW7u?key=iCG5M9LCDpdICPDZFbOVOw" alt=""></figure>



<p>This approach, instead of or in combination with a canal from Lake Meade skirting Las Vegas, brings water into the south west corner of Nevada, still at relatively low altitude.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The upstream end of the Mojave river can easily be fed by the California Aqueduct, which brings water from the Sacramento Delta south to Los Angeles. This flow would be augmented by significant desalination anywhere on the California coast. It could even be in the LA basin – the land requirement for 20 GW of distributed solar is hardly onerous. For one example, an array adjacent to the I5 between San Clemente and Camp Pendleton – all undeveloped land – would be more than sufficient.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfIGfmPoe1VLIe10rBd2bPxKg5FIbkPf1BQfwXbCyzE_mxJRCBAJnRyU3RSHZ7qWDyrc1JqtAcFQ65HRcytz6FrAfYQhVx5tVG4nS_KSZqOfuwUFDQ2iyhqt4KpLgW3X_c291gXvyfmNU3lgpYTv5jJ9IQ?key=iCG5M9LCDpdICPDZFbOVOw" alt=""></figure>



<p>If the desalination is occurring in the vicinity of the Sacramento delta, it may even be possible to pump water over the Sierras, then let it flow down the Truckee, Carson, or Walker rivers.</p>



<p>In some ways, the upstream instantiation of Nevada’s water supply is an aesthetic choice: Would you rather deal with California regulators or Mexican regulators? Fortunately, both are aligned on the broader political necessity to increase the supply of low cost water in essentially unlimited quantities. The best approach would be to set up a situation where sensible rents cause regulatory competition for deployment, not unlike early railroad siting. Save some money by skipping sealant on canals to ensure everyone along the route gets some free water, and all is well.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Routing within Nevada</strong></p>



<p>Geographically, Nevada’s valleys run primarily north-south. There is an east-west trending divide in the middle of the state, with better ordered north-flowing drainage feeding the Humboldt river, which in turn brings water to the Carson Sink in the western part of the state, near Reno. Southern drainage is mostly endorheic, though the White River (usually dry) drains south along the eastern edge of the state, ultimately into the Colorado.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdaK0IyWRJ-V284MwWTSvq_jGvurS1Sx8A92OUWtJwOmtiWw_eEO43i9g48OvnYYY0usvTQ7RBmHrSWB67IVLM547y9GoahITdx_u4ySwTbrsAzQK1NSf0Vg4K-SK5xnhOedud-Fpw-aHXaaOSY1jNzNjzp?key=iCG5M9LCDpdICPDZFbOVOw" alt=""></figure>



<p>Here’s a lovely map showing the various watersheds in the American West. The hodgepodge of colors in the middle reflect that Nevada’s valleys are mostly unconnected, at least for now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The low cost of PV affords considerable flexibility in routing of canals and choice in which valleys are terraformed and which may be left in their inhospitable desert state. It’s quite fun to peruse maps and connect the dots.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXerjKubFpwSHn8lSejWSy-YYqei5t5fs1iXYEghml0942IwhgF556ndFdi2y7C3um2aJl4-pCkxseYWIFKIkrHsLIQLpxKApiA0G9PnjK5msH_TZF1eQjN-y5YL5EpeZaAVUAvLCWoH_6JKnTdiNscrbEXj?key=iCG5M9LCDpdICPDZFbOVOw" alt=""></figure>



<p>One effective approach is to build a canal network that parallels <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_95">US Route 95</a>. This route has logistic access and relatively benign terrain. It would pump water uphill from Las Vegas, Amargosa Valley, and the Carson Sink to Tonopah, and from there to a flooded playa lake in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Smoky_Valley">Big Smoky Valley</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From here it can be pumped over ranges into the Reese Valley and/or Monitor Valley, both of which ultimately drain north to the Humboldt river, bolstering existing agriculture in these valleys and closing the loop on the western side. The Monitor Valley drainage passes through Diamond Valley, refilling a large lake which overflows into Huntington Creek and thence to the Humboldt river.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfAcfv05FNOCTbDNnoQ6C43hbfTD5KwV5aN_YpJSO8uMo6o7rLbv5SymrXgHjgnNpULSmk4pnaBPt9wdl7MY9JtUrOHKy07MpzP2vIv-DozNM7KGwisNXFsJhaGY_zmluXbcT7ogUcC1RUIAhs5DzSAv2yS?key=iCG5M9LCDpdICPDZFbOVOw" alt=""></figure>



<p>For water return to the Colorado River, water from Diamond Valley Lake can be diverted south via Eureka following the path of US Route 50 through Hiwee Valley, Newark Valley, and Jakes Valley into the White River watershed. In this scheme, the White River would also become a generous perennial river as opposed to a mostly dry valley.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The complete system, roughly mapped, could look like this. But infinite variations are possible – what is your ideal?</p>

<p>About 500 miles of canals (red) feed just over 1000 miles of natural drainages (black), creating more than 750 square miles of new directly irrigable agricultural land. Up to 1460 square miles of new lakes, depending mostly on how much water we leave in the Carson Sink, and 240,000 acres of prime waterfront real estate. Ultimate water consumption through evaporation and ground water recharge would be up to 3 maf per year, and commercially significant brines in some of the sinks may enable mineral development in addition to agriculture, commerce, and real estate. In all, over a trillion dollars of land value appreciation alone – an enormous windfall in a state with an annual GDP of about $200b and relatively little economic complexity.</p>

<p>Not to disturb desert lovers (myself included) too much – more than 90% of the state, including all existing National Parks, State Parks, and military bases, would remain unaffected by this project. There is plenty of empty land to go around.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How much would it cost? Baselining on the CAP and the earlier analysis of low cost desalination, I project:</p>



<ul>
<li>$4b for a 20 GW solar desal array</li>



<li>$4b for a matched low cost desal plant</li>



<li>$6b for canal construction, based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Arizona_Project">CAP</a> in Arizona and adjusting for scale.</li>



<li>$2b total for pumps and solar arrays to power them</li>
</ul>



<p>In all, ~$16b to restore a huge swath of the Pleistocene ecosystem, with over $1t of realizable value generation, in addition to ongoing revenue from development.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>This model generalizes</strong></p>



<p>Here we’ve looked at Nevada, and previously we’ve looked at the <a href="https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/2024/01/09/a-vision-for-the-alleviation-of-water-scarcity-in-the-us-southwest-and-the-revitalization-of-the-salton-sea/">southern edge of California</a>. I think the observation applies generally. Something like a third of Earth’s land surface area is very sparsely inhabited desert, much of it coastal and low lying, unlike Nevada. Arizona, Utah, New Mexico, the eastern Cascades, much of India, Australia, Namibia, Chile, Argentina, the Middle East, Central Asia, and Saharan Africa could be, with the use of less than 1% of its land for solar desalination, converted into an arbitrarily fertile paradise. Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE are well on the way, but the first solar desal megaproject awaits development. It could be you! Go forth!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>In mid-2022 I bought a new domain name.</p>

<p>The name was <code>musicbox.fun</code>. I got it for a side-project, an <a href="https://musicbox.fun/">interactive online music box</a> that I had built and hosted at <code>musicboxfun.com</code>. The new name was shorter and more quirky. I felt lucky to have grabbed it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, <code>musicbox.fun</code> had a history. Before I bought it, the domain was used to host pirated music.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://www.bryanbraun.com/assets/images/old-music-box-fun.png" alt="A screenshot of musicbox.fun as it existed in 2018, before I owned it">
  <figcaption><code>musicbox.fun</code>, as it existed in 2018 (before I owned it)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>From June 2018 to February 2021, the site racked up thousands of copyright violation complaints. Over 20,000 of its urls were delisted by Google (and other search engines) before the site went offline in 2022.</p>

<p>I had no idea, of course. It wasn’t until I had redirected all of my <code>musicboxfun.com</code> traffic to <code>musicbox.fun</code> that I noticed that something wasn’t right: my web traffic from organic search dropped to zero.</p>

<p>I assumed it was temporary so I double-checked my process and waited for awhile, but it never really recovered. It wasn’t until a year later that I discovered the copyright violations and learned that the domain name was compromised.</p>

<p>Apparently, this is a thing that happens to domain names, but as far as I know, there’s not really a name for it. When I described it to my wife, she said <em>“Oh, so it’s haunted.”</em></p>

<p>“Haunted” is the perfect word for this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Something terrible happened at the domain name in the past.</li>
  <li>On the surface, nothing seems wrong with the domain name.</li>
  <li>Then there are signs that something isn’t right.</li>
  <li>Obligatory jump-scare when you discover what happened.</li>
  <li>Internal debate: do you abandon it or try to fix it?</li>
  <li>There’s a ton of superstition around how to fix it.</li>
  <li>Superficial fixes don’t seem to work.</li>
</ul>

<figure>

  <figcaption>When there's something strange with your domain name, who you gonna call?</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>So to summarize, I’m saying a domain name is “haunted” when something in its past gives it a poor reputation among search engines, affecting its ability to rank in search results, even after it changes ownership.</p>

<p>The inner-workings of search engines are notoriously opaque*, making it difficult to 1) know if you’re being affected and 2) know how to fix it. The following are my suggestions, based on my experience with <code>musicbox.fun</code>.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-check-if-a-domain-name-is-haunted">How to check if a domain name is haunted</h2>

<p>Before you buy a domain name, there’s a few ways to check if it’s haunted:</p>

<h3 id="1-check-the-wayback-machine-at-archiveorg">1. Check the Wayback Machine at archive.org</h3>

<p>If you go to <a href="https://web.archive.org/">web.archive.org</a> and put in your domain name, it will pull up archived web pages of whatever lived at the domain in the past. Here’s a couple things to look out for:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Does anything in the past look illegal or sketchy (piracy, gambling, porn, etc)?</li>
  <li>Is the history suspiciously empty?
    <ul>
      <li>If so, then possibly the past content was <a href="https://help.archive.org/help/how-do-i-request-to-remove-something-from-archive-org-2/">removed by request</a> (I suspect this was the case for <code>musicbox.fun</code>)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="2-search-dmca-complaints">2. Search DMCA complaints</h3>

<p>DMCA stands for “Digital Millenium Copyright Act,” which is a US law that enables people to report copyright infractions to search engine companies (among other things). These reports are public, and you can look them up in a few ways:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Search <a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/">Google Transparency Report</a> for your domain, to find delist requests (you can <a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/copyright/domains/musicbox.fun">see the report for musicbox.fun here</a>).</li>
  <li>Search <a href="https://lumendatabase.org/">lumendatabase.org</a> for your domain, to find copyright complaints (for an example, see <a href="https://lumendatabase.org/notices/search?term=%22https%3A%2F%2Fmusicbox.fun%22&amp;term-exact-search=true&amp;sort_by=">these results for musicbox.fun</a>).</li>
</ol>

<p>Finding ANY copyright complaints for your domain is cause for concern, especially if there are a lot of them and they were filed recently.</p>

<h3 id="3-search-historical-seo-data">3. Search historical SEO data</h3>

<p>If you’re considering buying an important domain name, you may also want to search historical SEO data. Advanced SEO tools like <a href="https://ahrefs.com/">ahrefs.com</a> can give you detailed information about backlinks, ranking history, and estimates for traffic and domain authority. Often, you’ll need to pay to get full access to this kind of data.</p>

<p>Interpreting this data is beyond the scope of this post, but a bit of research can help uncover problems here.</p>

<h2 id="ok-its-haunted-now-what-do-i-do">Ok, it’s haunted. Now what do I do?</h2>

<h3 id="1-talk-to-the-search-engines">1. Talk to the search engines</h3>

<p>Many search engines have tools for domain owners, like <a href="https://search.google.com/search-console">Google Search Console</a> and <a href="https://www.bing.com/webmasters">Bing Webmaster Tools</a>. Definitely set up a profile and get your domain name added. It can help surface past issues and it gives you a way to report when issues have been resolved. For more details about specific actions you can take here, see <a href="https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/a/145283/36576">my stackexchange post</a> on the topic.</p>

<p>If your domain has DMCA complaints, you may be tempted to file a <a href="https://support.google.com/legal/troubleshooter/1114905?rd=2&amp;sjid=13861243148551035047-NC#ts=9814647%2C1115655%2C13630207%2C12999302%2C9814950%2C1115791">DMCA counter-notice</a>. Don’t do it. Counter-notices are for <em>errorneous</em> copyright complaints, not complaints that were once valid but no longer relevant. Per Google’s counter-notice submission form:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Please note: If the content on the page was infringing at the time the original removal request arrived, your counter notice is not legally valid. Do not submit a counter notice if there was illegal content, even if it’s now been removed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As far as I can tell, there’s not really anything you can do to make past, valid DCMA complaints go away.</p>

<h3 id="2-double-down-on-best-practices">2. Double-down on best practices</h3>

<p>My SEO strategy has always been to do great work and make it easy for Google to see it. It usually works pretty well (at least for my non-haunted domains). For haunted domains, you have a bad reputation to overturn, which seems to require extra vigilence. SEO basics, like high-quality, structured, accessible, content on a fast-loading site, are table stakes.</p>

<p>If you’ve done any SEO work, you know that search engines treat links to your site as a massive signal of relevance and trust. I suspect that fresh incoming links are especially important for overturning a bad reputation, though I haven’t confirmed this personally. If you think <code>musicbox.fun</code> is a useful project and you wield <a href="https://www.bryanbraun.com/2020/10/03/the-power-of-a-link/">the power of a link</a>, consider posting a link to it, and maybe we’ll find out together.</p>

<h3 id="3-wait-for-a-while">3. Wait for a while?</h3>

<p>In my research I found <a href="https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/a/99701/36576">a detailed stackexchange post about trust scores and how they are affected by DMCA complaints</a>. This post suggested that recovery could take some time:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It takes years to rebuild trust scores and for some sites, this may never happen.
…the reality is that a domain can ruin its value beyond redemption.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This post isn’t a primary source, but I also came across an Q&amp;A with a Google Search employee who fielded a similar question about DMCA violations. Their response said something similar, basically, that it can take time for the reputation effects to wear off (I’m struggling to find the video now, but I’ll link it when I do).</p>

<p>All of this is fairly disappointing. In a perfect world, when your legitimately good content isn’t being surfaced by Google, it’s a failure on <strong>their</strong> part, and <strong>their</strong> problem to solve, not yours. In practice, it is <strong>your</strong> problem and you have to do a bunch of work to help them see that their current assessment of your domain name is no longer accurate.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.bryanbraun.com/assets/images/this-house-is-clean.jpg" alt="Image of the medium from the movie 'Poltergeist' saying &quot;this house is clean&quot;"></p>

<hr>

<p>Ideally, search engine algorithms would give new domain owners a fresh start. Yes, it would prevent “haunted domain issues” but it would also reduce <a href="https://macwright.com/2024/10/16/domain-second-thoughts">squatting on trusted domains</a> (another issue I’ve been burned by). Unfortunately, we don’t live in that world*, so we only have a few options:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Avoid buying haunted domain names</li>
  <li>Abandon domain names, once you discover that they are haunted</li>
  <li>Put in a bunch of time and effort to restore a haunted domain name’s low trust score</li>
</ol>

<p>For <code>musicbox.fun</code>, I want to at least <em>try</em> #3. I’ve taken some of the steps above and it feels like I’m starting to see progress. It’s slow, but I’m not in a big hurry to restore traffic. The site is just a hobby and it was always a niche project for a niche audience.</p>

<p>Either way, I hope to post an update in a while to let you know if it improves over time.</p>

<hr>

<p><small>* It’s easy to attribute issues like these to anti-competitive behavior or some other malicious cause, but I don’t blame Google here. If their reputation algorithm was more transparent (or forgiving), it could be more easily exploited by bad actors. Obscurity prevents exploitation but also adds to the mystery and superstition that plagues the SEO industry. It’s tempting to get sucked into the mystery, trying to figure out the algorithm despite its constant changes and intentional obscurity, but that’s not how I want to live my life.</small></p>
