<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>In mid-2022 I bought a new domain name.</p>

<p>The name was <code>musicbox.fun</code>. I got it for a side-project, an <a href="https://musicbox.fun/">interactive online music box</a> that I had built and hosted at <code>musicboxfun.com</code>. The new name was shorter and more quirky. I felt lucky to have grabbed it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, <code>musicbox.fun</code> had a history. Before I bought it, the domain was used to host pirated music.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://www.bryanbraun.com/assets/images/old-music-box-fun.png" alt="A screenshot of musicbox.fun as it existed in 2018, before I owned it">
  <figcaption><code>musicbox.fun</code>, as it existed in 2018 (before I owned it)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>From June 2018 to February 2021, the site racked up thousands of copyright violation complaints. Over 20,000 of its urls were delisted by Google (and other search engines) before the site went offline in 2022.</p>

<p>I had no idea, of course. It wasn’t until I had redirected all of my <code>musicboxfun.com</code> traffic to <code>musicbox.fun</code> that I noticed that something wasn’t right: my web traffic from organic search dropped to zero.</p>

<p>I assumed it was temporary so I double-checked my process and waited for awhile, but it never really recovered. It wasn’t until a year later that I discovered the copyright violations and learned that the domain name was compromised.</p>

<p>Apparently, this is a thing that happens to domain names, but as far as I know, there’s not really a name for it. When I described it to my wife, she said <em>“Oh, so it’s haunted.”</em></p>

<p>“Haunted” is the perfect word for this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Something terrible happened at the domain name in the past.</li>
  <li>On the surface, nothing seems wrong with the domain name.</li>
  <li>Then there are signs that something isn’t right.</li>
  <li>Obligatory jump-scare when you discover what happened.</li>
  <li>Internal debate: do you abandon it or try to fix it?</li>
  <li>There’s a ton of superstition around how to fix it.</li>
  <li>Superficial fixes don’t seem to work.</li>
</ul>

<figure>
  <img src="https://www.bryanbraun.com/assets/images/ghostbusters.jpg" alt="A scene from the movie Ghostbusters.">
  <figcaption>When there's something strange with your domain name, who you gonna call?</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>So to summarize, I’m saying a domain name is “haunted” when something in its past gives it a poor reputation among search engines, affecting its ability to rank in search results, even after it changes ownership.</p>

<p>The inner-workings of search engines are notoriously opaque*, making it difficult to 1) know if you’re being affected and 2) know how to fix it. The following are my suggestions, based on my experience with <code>musicbox.fun</code>.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-check-if-a-domain-name-is-haunted">How to check if a domain name is haunted</h2>

<p>Before you buy a domain name, there’s a few ways to check if it’s haunted:</p>

<h3 id="1-check-the-wayback-machine-at-archiveorg">1. Check the Wayback Machine at archive.org</h3>

<p>If you go to <a href="https://web.archive.org/">web.archive.org</a> and put in your domain name, it will pull up archived web pages of whatever lived at the domain in the past. Here’s a couple things to look out for:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Does anything in the past look illegal or sketchy (piracy, gambling, porn, etc)?</li>
  <li>Is the history suspiciously empty?
    <ul>
      <li>If so, then possibly the past content was <a href="https://help.archive.org/help/how-do-i-request-to-remove-something-from-archive-org-2/">removed by request</a> (I suspect this was the case for <code>musicbox.fun</code>)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="2-search-dmca-complaints">2. Search DMCA complaints</h3>

<p>DMCA stands for “Digital Millenium Copyright Act,” which is a US law that enables people to report copyright infractions to search engine companies (among other things). These reports are public, and you can look them up in a few ways:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Search <a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/">Google Transparency Report</a> for your domain, to find delist requests (you can <a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/copyright/domains/musicbox.fun">see the report for musicbox.fun here</a>).</li>
  <li>Search <a href="https://lumendatabase.org/">lumendatabase.org</a> for your domain, to find copyright complaints (for an example, see <a href="https://lumendatabase.org/notices/search?term=%22https%3A%2F%2Fmusicbox.fun%22&amp;term-exact-search=true&amp;sort_by=">these results for musicbox.fun</a>).</li>
</ol>

<p>Finding ANY copyright complaints for your domain is cause for concern, especially if there are a lot of them and they were filed recently.</p>

<h3 id="3-search-historical-seo-data">3. Search historical SEO data</h3>

<p>If you’re considering buying an important domain name, you may also want to search historical SEO data. Advanced SEO tools like <a href="https://ahrefs.com/">ahrefs.com</a> can give you detailed information about backlinks, ranking history, and estimates for traffic and domain authority. Often, you’ll need to pay to get full access to this kind of data.</p>

<p>Interpreting this data is beyond the scope of this post, but a bit of research can help uncover problems here.</p>

<h2 id="ok-its-haunted-now-what-do-i-do">Ok, it’s haunted. Now what do I do?</h2>

<h3 id="1-talk-to-the-search-engines">1. Talk to the search engines</h3>

<p>Many search engines have tools for domain owners, like <a href="https://search.google.com/search-console">Google Search Console</a> and <a href="https://www.bing.com/webmasters">Bing Webmaster Tools</a>. Definitely set up a profile and get your domain name added. It can help surface past issues and it gives you a way to report when issues have been resolved. For more details about specific actions you can take here, see <a href="https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/a/145283/36576">my stackexchange post</a> on the topic.</p>

<p>If your domain has DMCA complaints, you may be tempted to file a <a href="https://support.google.com/legal/troubleshooter/1114905?rd=2&amp;sjid=13861243148551035047-NC#ts=9814647%2C1115655%2C13630207%2C12999302%2C9814950%2C1115791">DMCA counter-notice</a>. Don’t do it. Counter-notices are for <em>errorneous</em> copyright complaints, not complaints that were once valid but no longer relevant. Per Google’s counter-notice submission form:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Please note: If the content on the page was infringing at the time the original removal request arrived, your counter notice is not legally valid. Do not submit a counter notice if there was illegal content, even if it’s now been removed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As far as I can tell, there’s not really anything you can do to make past, valid DCMA complaints go away.</p>

<h3 id="2-double-down-on-best-practices">2. Double-down on best practices</h3>

<p>My SEO strategy has always been to do great work and make it easy for Google to see it. It usually works pretty well (at least for my non-haunted domains). For haunted domains, you have a bad reputation to overturn, which seems to require extra vigilence. SEO basics, like high-quality, structured, accessible, content on a fast-loading site, are table stakes.</p>

<p>If you’ve done any SEO work, you know that search engines treat links to your site as a massive signal of relevance and trust. I suspect that fresh incoming links are especially important for overturning a bad reputation, though I haven’t confirmed this personally. If you think <code>musicbox.fun</code> is a useful project and you wield <a href="https://www.bryanbraun.com/2020/10/03/the-power-of-a-link/">the power of a link</a>, consider posting a link to it, and maybe we’ll find out together.</p>

<h3 id="3-wait-for-a-while">3. Wait for a while?</h3>

<p>In my research I found <a href="https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/a/99701/36576">a detailed stackexchange post about trust scores and how they are affected by DMCA complaints</a>. This post suggested that recovery could take some time:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It takes years to rebuild trust scores and for some sites, this may never happen.
…the reality is that a domain can ruin its value beyond redemption.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This post isn’t a primary source, but I also came across an Q&amp;A with a Google Search employee who fielded a similar question about DMCA violations. Their response said something similar, basically, that it can take time for the reputation effects to wear off (I’m struggling to find the video now, but I’ll link it when I do).</p>

<p>All of this is fairly disappointing. In a perfect world, when your legitimately good content isn’t being surfaced by Google, it’s a failure on <strong>their</strong> part, and <strong>their</strong> problem to solve, not yours. In practice, it is <strong>your</strong> problem and you have to do a bunch of work to help them see that their current assessment of your domain name is no longer accurate.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.bryanbraun.com/assets/images/this-house-is-clean.jpg" alt="Image of the medium from the movie 'Poltergeist' saying &quot;this house is clean&quot;"></p>

<hr>

<p>Ideally, search engine algorithms would give new domain owners a fresh start. Yes, it would prevent “haunted domain issues” but it would also reduce <a href="https://macwright.com/2024/10/16/domain-second-thoughts">squatting on trusted domains</a> (another issue I’ve been burned by). Unfortunately, we don’t live in that world*, so we only have a few options:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Avoid buying haunted domain names</li>
  <li>Abandon domain names, once you discover that they are haunted</li>
  <li>Put in a bunch of time and effort to restore a haunted domain name’s low trust score</li>
</ol>

<p>For <code>musicbox.fun</code>, I want to at least <em>try</em> #3. I’ve taken some of the steps above and it feels like I’m starting to see progress. It’s slow, but I’m not in a big hurry to restore traffic. The site is just a hobby and it was always a niche project for a niche audience.</p>

<p>Either way, I hope to post an update in a while to let you know if it improves over time.</p>

<hr>

<p><small>* It’s easy to attribute issues like these to anti-competitive behavior or some other malicious cause, but I don’t blame Google here. If their reputation algorithm was more transparent (or forgiving), it could be more easily exploited by bad actors. Obscurity prevents exploitation but also adds to the mystery and superstition that plagues the SEO industry. It’s tempting to get sucked into the mystery, trying to figure out the algorithm despite its constant changes and intentional obscurity, but that’s not how I want to live my life.</small></p>

We don't see it that way.

"In dangerous times, honest people need to stand up.

"Disturbing spinelessness at an institution famed for courage."</p><p>The Washington Post Guild, the union that represents the newspaper's staff, in a statement posted on the social media site X said it was "deeply concerned that The Washington Post — an American news institution in the nation's capital — would make a decision to no longer endorse presidential candidates, especially a mere 11 days ahead of an immensely consequential election."</p><p>"The message from our chief executive, Will Lewis — not from the Editorial Board itself — makes us concerned that management interfered with the work of our members in Editorial," the Guild said in the statement, which noted the paper's reporting about Bezos' role in the decision.</p><p>"We are already seeing cancellations from once loyal readers," the Guild said.

Like countless other Midwestern farmers, he heeded the advice from industry and government leaders to “plant fence row to fence row” to increase the production of commodities.</p><p>“And that’s what we did … tore out all the fences and hedgerows,” Charles Payne said. “Now I wish I had some of them back.”</p><p>U.S. agriculture&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/agricultural-productivity-in-the-u-s/summary-of-recent-findings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">production tripled</a>&nbsp;in the latter half of the 20th century, due in part to chemical inputs.

MacNeil, Missourian</figcaption></figure><p>But University of Missouri rural sociologist Mary Hendrickson said the way Charles Payne farmed was also a result of policy, research and methods encouraged by the industry at the time. Before the ecological consequences were understood, chemical inputs were “miracles” for a farm.</p><p>“Everybody who was going to be an advanced, innovative farmer, they were using chemicals for weed control, for pest control, for all of these things,” she said.</p><p>Hendrickson said for a certain generation of farmers, their skepticism or resistance to regenerative agriculture is a result of their lived experience.</p><p>“There’s a reason why somebody who has lived through that transition says, ‘Wait, you want me to go back to what?” Hendrickson said.</p><p>The advice Charles Payne’s grandchildren, Josh and his sister Jordan Welch, are getting is sometimes the exact opposite of what he was told in his day.</p><p>Hendrickson said this isn’t unique to agriculture. There are many things in life that people do differently than their grandparents’ generation — such as cooking, cleaning or child rearing.</p><p>“The things that my mother did to raise me were not in vogue when I was born, and they were (again) 20 years later,” she said.</p><h3>Generational legacy</h3><p>Farming isn’t Josh Payne’s first vocation. After teaching English for years, he said he ended up back on the farm “completely accidentally” when his grandfather requested help managing the land about 15 years ago.</p><p>“When we got here it was a very, very conventional farm. Everything was commodity, corn and soy. Everything was Roundup ready. Everything was genetically modified,” Josh Payne said. “I call it growing nickels and dimes.”</p><p>Payne wasn’t exactly happy row cropping, and he was curious about trying other methods. But when he discovered his allergy to herbicides, it was a catalyst for change.</p><p>“Grandpa, I’m either going to have to go back to teaching or we’re going to have to completely change what we do,” he told Charles Payne.</p><p>The Paynes now rotationally graze their sheep among 800 chestnut trees — a method called “silvopasture,” which revives the soil by keeping living roots in the ground year round. They planted the trees eight years ago and are completing their third harvest.</p><p>Before the flock of sheep was added to the operation, the Paynes cultivated conventional crops in between the orchard rows that are spaced 30-feet apart — a regenerative method called alley cropping. The Paynes are still finding ways to grow and adapt, most recently by adding a produce garden.</p><p>Charles Payne has been farming the stretch of land in Concordia since 1956. He said corn, soy and wheat were the “going” crops at the time.</p><figure><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" width="780" height="520" data-attachment-id="748684" data-permalink="https://investigatemidwest.org/2024/10/11/regenerative-farming-practices-require-unlearning-past-advice/6705b1f54b7f5-image/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/investigatemidwest.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/6705b1f54b7f5.image_.jpg?fit=1035%2C690&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1035,690" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="6705b1f54b7f5.image" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/investigatemidwest.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/6705b1f54b7f5.image_.jpg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/investigatemidwest.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/6705b1f54b7f5.image_.jpg?fit=780%2C520&amp;ssl=1" tabindex="0" role="button" src="https://i0.wp.com/investigatemidwest.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/6705b1f54b7f5.image_.jpg?resize=780%2C520&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/investigatemidwest.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/6705b1f54b7f5.image_.jpg?w=1035&amp;ssl=1 1035w, https://i0.wp.com/investigatemidwest.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/6705b1f54b7f5.image_.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/investigatemidwest.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/6705b1f54b7f5.image_.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/investigatemidwest.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/6705b1f54b7f5.image_.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/investigatemidwest.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/6705b1f54b7f5.image_.jpg?resize=400%2C267&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/investigatemidwest.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/6705b1f54b7f5.image_.jpg?resize=706%2C471&amp;ssl=1 706w, https://i0.wp.com/investigatemidwest.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/6705b1f54b7f5.image_.jpg?w=370&amp;ssl=1 370w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px"><figcaption>Josh Payne closes the electric fence after 1,000 sheep pass through to a fresh paddock Sept. 3 at the Payne family farm in Concordia. Payne said that moving 1,000 sheep from paddock to paddock is easier than moving a small number. photo by Cory W. MacNeil, Missourian</figcaption></figure><p>“We had some good years and we had some very poor years too,” he said.</p><p>Josh Payne said his grandfather has a deep knowledge of the land and the industry and now acts as a mentor and adviser to his grandkids.</p><p>Although he said he’s had to learn to bite his tongue at times during this transition, Charles Payne said he’s happy they are farming.</p><p>“That’s a good thing to have your grandkids farming where you left off,” Charles Payne said. “Of course, it’s a different way of farming, but they’re on the farm, and they seem to really enjoy it.”</p><p>For Charles and Josh Payne, the elder’s resistance to change and the younger’s desire for change were both motivated by the goal to keep the farm alive. Josh Payne said the markets for sheep and chestnuts are good and support jobs for him and his sister. He said they’re comparable to the markets his grandfather had for corn, soy and wheat decades ago.</p><p>“Grandpa, you made the right decisions for your time,” he said. “You were faithful to this land, to this place, to your family … but that just looks different now.”</p><p>Rural sociologist Hendrickson said in agriculture communities especially, there exists a generational pressure to farm and to succeed doing so.</p><p>“This identity as a farmer and the land and holding that for the next generation was significant for farmers,” she said.</p><p>For years farmers heard that to be successful in modern agriculture, they’d have to get big or get out. Payne thinks there’s another option.</p><p>“I think people either got to get big or get weird,” Josh Payne said. “We chose to get weird.”</p><h3>‘The new old way’</h3><p>Regenerative agriculture starts with the soil. The health of farm ground is connected to the financial viability and resiliency of the farm, said Chuck Rice, a professor at Kansas State University.</p><p>“We’ve lost 50% of our soil organic matter with 100 plus years of cultivation in the United States,” Rice said. “So we aren’t taking care of our soils.”</p><p>Methods like those Josh Payne has implemented on the Concordia farm revive — or regenerate — the soil and by extension the ecosystem. Regenerative agriculture methods aim to not only restore farmland to its prechemical and industrial state, but to help the land withstand the severe weather threats from climate change.</p><p>“Not only is the economy changing, but the climate’s changing,” Rice said. “I think if you’re staying with the same practices … ultimately you’re going to be losing out.”</p><p>Reducing or eliminating tillage of the soil, a practice called “no till,” is often the first step for farmers looking to operate more sustainably. Rice said market forces can sometimes jump start changes in the agriculture industry. In order to till fields, farmers need diesel fuel to power their equipment. That gas was highly priced during the 1970s fuel crisis, which made no till more popular, Rice said.</p><figure><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" width="780" height="520" data-attachment-id="748689" data-permalink="https://investigatemidwest.org/2024/10/11/regenerative-farming-practices-require-unlearning-past-advice/67054975b7485-image/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/investigatemidwest.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/67054975b7485.image_.jpg?fit=1763%2C1176&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1763,1176" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="67054975b7485.image" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/investigatemidwest.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/67054975b7485.image_.jpg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/investigatemidwest.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/67054975b7485.image_.jpg?fit=780%2C520&amp;ssl=1" tabindex="0" role="button" src="https://i0.wp.com/investigatemidwest.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/67054975b7485.image_.jpg?resize=780%2C520&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/investigatemidwest.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/67054975b7485.image_.jpg?w=1763&amp;ssl=1 1763w, https://i0.wp.com/investigatemidwest.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/67054975b7485.image_.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/investigatemidwest.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/67054975b7485.image_.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/investigatemidwest.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/67054975b7485.image_.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/investigatemidwest.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/67054975b7485.image_.jpg?resize=1536%2C1025&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/investigatemidwest.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/67054975b7485.image_.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/investigatemidwest.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/67054975b7485.image_.jpg?resize=1568%2C1046&amp;ssl=1 1568w, https://i0.wp.com/investigatemidwest.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/67054975b7485.image_.jpg?resize=400%2C267&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/investigatemidwest.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/67054975b7485.image_.jpg?resize=706%2C471&amp;ssl=1 706w, https://i0.wp.com/investigatemidwest.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/67054975b7485.image_.jpg?w=370&amp;ssl=1 370w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px"><figcaption>Josh Payne exits the shed where he grows micro-grains with a tray of sprouts to feed his the pigs Sept. 20 at the Payne family farm in Concordia.

Rice said Kansas farmers are leaders in no till operation, encompassing about 40% of the state’s farmed acres.</p><p>“We still haven’t reached its peak, but it’s one of the more common practices,” Rice said.</p><p>Cody Jolliff is a farm historian and the CEO of the Midwest Center for Regenerative Agriculture at Powell Gardens, a botanical garden in Kansas City.</p><p>The Powell Gardens’ Midwest Center for Regenerative Agriculture is creating a living laboratory for farmers to come to Kansas City and get hands-on experience in regenerative agriculture methods. Or as Jolliff said, to learn “the new old way” to farm.</p><p>He said in many ways, regenerative agriculture is a return to the farming of another era.</p><p>“It’s really interesting though, because as we are going to these super modern methods, they also have a lot of resemblance to old methods,” he said.</p><p>Before the Civil War, over half of the country’s residents were farmers, Jolliff said, and they worked with small parcels of land in diversified operations.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
<p>Ever tried to get an ice cream at McDonald’s, only to hear, “Sorry, our machine’s broken?” You’re not the only one: <a href="https://mcbroken.com/">almost 15%</a> of ice cream machines at McDonald’s are broken right now around the US—and in New York, it’s 32%. But today, we won more ice cream, and things should start to change.</p>



<p>The U.S. Copyright Office <a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2024-24563.pdf">just handed down a ruling</a> that marks an important victory for Right to Repair: we can now legally repair commercial food preparation equipment, including McDonald’s machines, without running afoul of copyright law.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ve been fighting for years to challenge the digital locks that manufacturers like Taylor (which makes McDonald’s ice cream machines) use to keep repair information out of reach, forcing expensive service calls for simple fixes. Digital locks blocking repair come from an archaic 1998 copyright law, and every three years, we get a chance to ask the Copyright Office to give us exemptions to that law. Last time, <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/54317/section-1201-exemptions-for-2021-repair-consoles-medical-devices">we won exemptions for basically all consumer equipment</a>, vehicles, and medical devices. The time before that, <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/11951/1201-copyright-final-rule">we won smartphones</a> and home appliances. This time, <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/92942/the-ftc-and-doj-call-for-ice-cream-machine-repair">the FTC and DOJ even weighed in</a> to support our petition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But while this is a significant step forward, the battle is far from over. Any McDonald’s franchisee can hack your own machine, but if you want to share what you found with your friends or <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/kytch-taylor-mcdonalds-ice-cream-machine-smoking-gun/">sell a tool to help diagnose</a> and fix your machine, you’re out of luck. Plus, the ruling didn’t go nearly far enough in granting broader exemptions for repairing other commercial or industrial equipment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Trust us, we’re not stopping there. This is a big win—and we’ll be celebrating with ice cream!—but copyright law still needs fixing before we’re free to fix everything we own.</p>



<h2>The Win: You’re Now Free to Hack Your Ice Cream Machine</h2>



<p>For years, McDonald’s franchise owners have struggled with error codes and malfunctioning ice cream machines that could only be fixed by manufacturer-authorized technicians. The machines would often sit broken for extended periods because owners couldn’t troubleshoot or repair them on their own, due to digital locks embedded in the machine’s software. These locks are <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/some-electronics-repairs-are-illegal-federal-law-could-change-that/">protected under Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)</a>, which generally makes it illegal to bypass software locks known as “technological protection measures,” even for legitimate repairs.</p>



<p>That changes today. Thanks to the new exemption granted by the Copyright Office, owners, repair technicians, and tinkerers can now legally bypass the software locks on retail-level commercial food preparation equipment, such as the Taylor ice cream machines. This allows for the diagnosis, maintenance, and repair of the machines without needing to rely on costly service calls or manufacturer intervention. The exemption also applies to other commercial kitchen equipment—we’ve heard about undocumented <a href="https://assets.breville.com/BES920/BES920_ANZ_IB_O21_FA_WEB.pdf">error codes in commercial espresso machines</a>, restaurant owners getting <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sheetz/comments/y35axd/sheetz_merrychef_manager_password/">locked out of their own commercial ovens</a>, and <a href="https://hvac-talk.com/vbb/threads/176851-ALTO-SHAAM-service-manuals">missing service manuals</a> for insulated cabinets. But we’re <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90923565/congress-mcdonalds-ice-cream-machines">especially excited</a> about the ice cream win.</p>



<p>For ice cream lovers everywhere, this could mean fewer “machine broken” signs at McDonald’s and more sundaes and McFlurries available when you want them. It’s tangible progress in the fight to regain control over the products we own.</p>



<figure><img fetchpriority="high" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="1200" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2020/10/19094648/oneplus_nord_tools.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2020/10/19094648/oneplus_nord_tools.jpg 1600w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2020/10/19094648/oneplus_nord_tools-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2020/10/19094648/oneplus_nord_tools-1200x900.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"><figcaption>Repair’s pretty difficult without tools.</figcaption></figure>



<h2>The Problem: We Still Don’t Have Repair Tools</h2>



<p>Here’s the catch: while it’s now legal to circumvent the digital locks on these machines, the ruling does not allow us to share or distribute the tools necessary to do so. This is a major limitation. Most franchise owners and independent repair shops won’t have the technical expertise to create their own unlocking tools from scratch, meaning that while the door to repair has been opened, few will be able to walk through it without significant difficulty.</p>



<p>It is still a crime for iFixit to sell a tool to fix ice cream machines, and that’s a real shame. The ruling doesn’t change the underlying statute making it illegal to share or sell tools that bypass software locks. This leaves most of the repair work inaccessible to the average person, since the technical barriers remain high. Without these tools, this exemption is largely theoretical for many small businesses that don’t have in-house repair experts.</p>



<h2>The Miss: Broader Exemptions for Commercial and Industrial Equipment</h2>



<p>Even more disappointing is the denial of broader exemptions for commercial and industrial equipment. While we succeeded in securing an exemption for retail-level food equipment, the Copyright Office declined to extend similar protections to a wider class of commercial devices—meaning the ruling does not apply to things like heavy machinery, factory equipment, or even broader categories of restaurant hardware.</p>



<p>This was a key part of our petition, as the same issues plague repair in other industries. Many businesses, from farmers to factory owners, face the same frustrations: they are locked out of their own equipment by digital restrictions that prevent them from making repairs without calling in a certified technician. We pointed to examples like the <a href="https://social.hackerspace.pl/@q3k/111528162462505087">Polish trains</a> that were locked “for arbitrary reasons after being serviced at third-party workshops” with “bogus error codes,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PLC/comments/9dzlv1/safety_plccontroller_passwords/">multi-million dollar factory machines</a> getting bricked for a lack of software access, and a school that <a href="https://hvac-talk.com/vbb/threads/159467-NAE25-Metasyssyagent-Password-Reset">lost access to its HVAC system</a> when the maintenance technician passed away.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Forget about Sony and Netflix, there's DRM in public trains now...." width="456" height="257" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/w8NqBXT6Kos?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>We asked for an exemption that would cover all software-enabled commercial and industrial devices, but the Copyright Office denied this broader request, citing a lack of sufficient evidence that digital locks were creating adverse effects across a wider range of equipment.</p>



<p>Without this broader exemption, a significant portion of the repair market is still controlled by manufacturers, who can charge exorbitant prices for repair services and restrict access to parts and tools. This leaves many small businesses with no choice but to endure downtime and extra costs, even when a simple repair could get them back up and running quickly.</p>



<h2>Renewals: What We Won, What We Didn’t</h2>



<p>Every three years, the Copyright Office reviews the current exemptions and decides which ones to renew, expand, or let expire. This year, we secured several important renewals, though some gaps remain.</p>

<h3>What We Won:</h3>



<p><strong>Medical Devices:</strong></p>



<p>Renewals were granted for medical devices, allowing technicians to access software controlling devices like defibrillators and insulin pumps. This helps ensure that life-saving equipment can be repaired quickly and efficiently, which is crucial for patient care. This renewal is essential for hospitals repairing their own equipment, and came despite heated opposition from AdvaMed. The medical device manufacturers are so upset about all of this that they are <a href="https://1technation.com/mita-advamed-appeal-dismissal-of-copyright-lawsuit/">suing the Copyright Office</a> over the last rulemaking that originally granted this exemption three years ago.</p>



<p><strong>Repair of Motorized Vehicles, Marine Vessels, and Agricultural Equipment:</strong></p>



<p>Exemptions allowing the repair of computer programs in motorized land vehicles, marine vessels, and mechanized agricultural equipment were renewed. This means farmers can continue to repair their tractors, and boat owners can fix their vessels without worrying about digital locks​.</p>



<p><strong>Consumer Devices:</strong></p>



<p>We also successfully renewed the exemption that allows repairs on consumer electronic devices, such as smartphones, tablets, and home appliances. This is a critical exemption for everyday consumers who want the right to repair their own gadgets without voiding warranties or violating copyright law​.</p>



<p><strong>Assistive Technologies:</strong></p>



<p>The exemptions for assistive technologies were renewed as well, ensuring that people with disabilities can access and use literary and musical works through assistive software without running afoul of copyright restrictions​.</p>

</p><figcaption>Video game alternative input methods like eye tracking sometimes require getting around technological protection measures—and the Copyright Office declined to renew that exemption.</figcaption></figure>



<h3>What We Didn’t Win:</h3>



<p><strong>Video Game Accessibility:</strong></p>



<p>Unfortunately, the exemption allowing circumvention of digital locks on video games for accessibility purposes (introduced in 2021) was not renewed. No petition for renewal was submitted, and as a result, individuals with disabilities who need alternative input methods to play video games are left out.</p>



<p><strong>Broader Exemptions for Industrial Devices:</strong></p>



<p>As mentioned earlier, we failed to secure a broader exemption for industrial and commercial equipment. This leaves a huge number of businesses still locked out of the right to repair their own machinery​.</p>



<h2>Why Does This Matter?</h2>



<p>The Copyright Office’s ruling is a step in the right direction, but it’s far from the finish line. We’re thrilled to be able to fix ice cream machines, but without tools, most franchise owners won’t be able to take full advantage of this new freedom. And while retail food equipment is now covered, the vast world of commercial and industrial devices remains stuck in a repair monopoly, where manufacturers control who can fix what and at what cost.</p>



<p>This ruling highlights the ongoing battle between consumers and manufacturers over the right to repair. We’ve made significant strides, but we’re still facing systemic barriers that prevent small businesses and consumers from taking control of their own products.</p>



<h2>What’s Next?</h2>



<p>We’ll take today’s victory and keep fighting for more. Next on our list? Fixing federal copyright law, which is the only way we can secure access to the tools we need and share what we find as we troubleshoot our machines. iFixit CEO Kyle Wiens <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/78204/congress-asks-ifixit-if-the-right-to-repair-exists">testified before congress</a> last year about why this is so important, and we’re hoping to see US federal legislation like last session’s <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/56976/freedom-to-repair-act">Freedom to Repair Act</a>.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Canada is in the final stages of <a href="https://www.parl.ca/legisinfo/en/bill/44-1/c-244">considering legislation</a> that would fix the Canadian version of the DMCA, a bill called C-244 that is in its third reading in the Senate and expected to move before the end of the month. If Canada legalized circumventing technological protection measures for the purposes of repair, we might just have to head north to find the tools we need to do repairs.</p>



<p>So go enjoy that McFlurry—just know that the fight to fix isn’t over yet.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <div><p>This post tries to explain the new reasoning techniques developed by <a href="https://x.com/_xjdr">XJDR</a> in a new project called
<a href="https://github.com/xjdr-alt/entropix">Entropix</a>.</p><p>Entropix attempts to improve reasoning in models through being smarter at sampling during moments of uncertainty.</p><p>A big caveat, there have been no large scale evals yet for Entropix, so it’s not clear how much this helps in practice. But it does seem to introduce some promising techniques and mental models for reasoning.</p></div>
<h2 id="uncertainity-at-a-glance">Uncertainity at a glance</h2>
<p>Sampling is the process of choosing which token from the distribution of possible tokens (the logits) that a LLM chooses. You can tell how confident a model is in its predictions by looking at that distribution.</p>
<p>This is a <strong>confident</strong> model prediction for the next token:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.thariq.io/images/entropix/lowe-lowv.png" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-11 at 10.08.08 AM.png"></p><p>But in reality, models are not always so sure of their predictions. You will often run into cases where the next token prediction looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.thariq.io/images/entropix/lowe-highv.png" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-11 at 10.08.08 AM.png"><img src="https://www.thariq.io/images/entropix/highe-lowv.png" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-11 at 10.09.29 AM.png"></p>
<p>In these cases, the model is uncertain.</p>
<p>Entropix is a method for using <strong>adaptive sampling</strong> to make better decisions when the model is uncertain.</p>
<h3 id="what-does-uncertainity-mean-and-does-it-matter">What does uncertainity mean, and does it matter?</h3>
<p>This uncertainty in the logits might have many different underlying causes, and not all are bad.</p>
<p>Causes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The tokens are synonyms or equivalent (e.g. good vs great)</li>
<li>There are branching paths (e.g. the AI could either write your program in Java or C)</li>
<li>The AI may genuinely not be sure what to do (it is ‘out of distribution’, it hasn’t seen this in its training data before).</li>
</ul>
<p>Entropix suggests that you should have <em>different methods</em> for choosing the next token, depending on how uncertain you are.</p>
<p>How do we do that? To start, we need to measure uncertainty.</p>
<h2 id="entropy-and-varentropy">Entropy and Varentropy</h2>
<p>The key tools that Entropix uses are two metrics that measure uncertainty: <strong>the entropy</strong> &amp; <strong>varentropy</strong> of the logits.</p>
<p>Entropy measures how different the predicted logits are from each other, i.e. how uncertain we are in the most probably outcome. In low entropy, we are pretty certain in a few of the logits. In high entropy, the distribution of the logits is more uniform and we are much less certain.</p>
<p>Varentropy is a different type of entropy metric. It gives us an idea of the “shape” of the uncertainty. High varentropy indicates that some of the values are highly different from others.</p>

<p>Combined, the two of us give 4 possible states:</p>
<ul>
<li>Low entropy, low varentropy: A very peaked distribution (one highly probable outcome).</li>
<li>Low entropy, high varentropy: A distribution with a few disparate peaks.</li>
<li>High entropy, low varentropy: A uniform or near-uniform distribution.</li>
<li>High entropy, high varentropy: A spread-out but uneven distribution.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="adaptive-sampling-based-on-entropy--varentropy">Adaptive Sampling based on Entropy &amp; Varentropy</h2>
<p>Now that we have those metrics for uncertainty, we can use them to perform different types of sampling based on the situation.</p>
<h3 id="low-entropy-low-varentropy">Low Entropy, Low Varentropy</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.thariq.io/images/entropix/lowe-lowv.png" alt="Low entropy, low varentropy"></p><p>This is usually the ideal case. The model is certain not only in what its first option would be, but also what it would choose if the first option was incorrect. Often times this means that the list is ordered in a neat way.</p>
<p>In this case, adaptive sampling would suggest the standard argmax sampling, e.g. choose the token with the highest probabilitly.</p>
<h3 id="low-entropy-high-varentropy">Low Entropy, High Varentropy</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.thariq.io/images/entropix/lowe-highv.png" alt="Low entropy, high varentropy"></p><p>In this case, the model predicts a few options very highly.</p>
<p>This is a tricky case- it may be representing a whole new branch of output, or it may be representing a few options such as a synonym.</p>
<p>In this case, we may want to “<strong>branch</strong>” by predicting both logits, seeing what paths they take and comparing the results after some point. There are many ways to implement this branching, which deserves its own post.</p>
<p>Depending on the results of the branching, we could take different actions. If we get two branches with fairly equal confidence (as measured by their entropy and varentropy) but with different contents, we could formulate this as a question to the user.</p>
<h3 id="high-entropy-low-varentropy">High Entropy, Low Varentropy</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.thariq.io/images/entropix/highe-lowv.png" alt="High entropy, low varentropy"></p><p>This state represents a possible low confidence state in the model. It may be seeing something that it doesn’t recognize at all, or all the options may be interchangeable with each other.</p>
<p>The best thing to do here is to help the model get to a higher confidence state. Entropix suggests using a <strong>“thinking” token</strong> here as the next token, e.g. <em>“Wait..”</em></p>
<p>A thinking token is a token that we insert into the output, to make the model realizes it needs to spend more compute time thinking about the answer before giving one.</p>
<p>For example, if the model is predicting <em>“The capital of Germany is Paris”</em> but it is not sure about the answer, it might insert a thinking token and predict <em>“The capital of Germany is Paris… Wait, no, it’s actually Berlin”</em></p>
<h3 id="high-entropy-high-varentropy">High Entropy, High Varentropy</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.thariq.io/images/entropix/highe-highv.png" alt="High entropy, high varentropy"></p><p>The model has no clear favorite, but it is more certain in some outputs than others. This is a difficult place to be in. One way to think about is that any of the top options may be solid choices (e.g. they are synonyms to each other), and so we should just choose one at random (aka a higher temperature).</p>
<p>We could also branch, or insert thinking tokens like we have done in previous options.</p>
<h2 id="branching-vs-thinking-tokens">Branching vs Thinking Tokens</h2>
<p>Branching &amp; thinking tokens are two different ways of achieving more compute in an uncertain state.</p>
<p>Branching predictions involves following a few logits to see what other tokens they lead to. This is often called MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search) and is a method that has been often tried in LLMs to middling success. One of the tradeoffs of branching is that it requires using inference compute in a way where the branches cannot benefit from each others compute.</p>
<p>Thinking tokens are a way of achieving more compute in an uncertain state without sacrificing some of that compute to explore a branch that you might kill. Inserting “Wait…” causes the AI to realize that it might have made a mistake.</p>
<p>Branching vs thinking tokens is overall an open research question, and deserving of another post.</p>
<h2 id="attention-entropy">Attention Entropy</h2>
<p>It’s worth noting that there are other measures of entropy that we might take into account. Entropix uses them slightly to figure out how to modify temperature, but they might be other tools.</p>
<p><strong>Attention Entropy</strong> - How much are your attention heads tend to follow specific tokens, vs pay attention to a large number of tokens in the context.</p>
<p><strong>Attention Agreement</strong> - How much your attention heads are paying attention to the same tokens as each other, vs different ones.</p>
<p>If your heads have low entropy and high agreement, that can be another signal for you to be confident sampling the highest probability. Low agreement might indicate that different heads are contributing to different predictions, and it might be worth branching.</p>
<h2 id="does-this-matter">Does this matter?</h2>
<p>The insights in Entropix feel in many ways fairly easy to understand, and not entirely novel, which has been surprising to many.</p>
<p>Even if the evals don’t show a large benefit yet. But, inference-time techniques like this are easy to experiment with and could be a promising direction for open source hackers to improve reasoning without huge budgets.</p>  </div></div>]]></description>

We’re also considering creating a serverless Database as a Service (DBaaS) offering, which would allow anyone to create an arbitrary number of Git repositories in the cloud and use them in their own product. If you’d be interested in a DBaaS product like this, please reach out to<!-- --> <a href="https://x.com/nataliemarleny">@nataliemarleny</a>!</p><h3>Motivation</h3><p>Originally, while working on a note-taking application for developers based on Git, we encountered the need to host Git repositories efficiently. Wanting to avoid managing the servers ourselves, we experimented with a serverless approach. After researching, we couldn’t find anyone attempting something similar, so besides its potential usefulness, it also seemed like an interesting problem to solve.</p><p>We’re big fans of Cloudflare and their Workers platform and we were aware of<!-- --> <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/">Durable Objects</a>. In terms of the usage model, likely access patterns, and general philosophy, Durable Objects seemed like the perfect underlying storage for a project like this.</p><p>We consider Durable Objects a novel and revolutionary type of storage. It offers a key-value store that is transactional, strongly consistent, and persistent. It’s tightly integrated with the Workers runtime and is suitable for all sorts of coordination and application-data use cases. Given its usefulness, we fully expect that other cloud providers will offer a comparable type of storage alongside their serverless offerings in the future.</p><p>When we started our research, we knew that Cloudflare had built D1 (their SQLite database offering) on Durable Objects. In addition to our early experiments with Durable Objects, this made us confident that what we intended to implement was feasible, so we made it our goal to host a Git repository within a Durable Object.</p><h3>Git in Cloudflare Workers</h3><p>Cloudflare Workers is a serverless platform based on the V8 JavaScript engine, which can also execute Wasm binaries, so when attempting to run Git in this environment, we had somewhat limited options. We tried a few different approaches, but in the end, there were only two legitimate candidates:</p><ol><li><a href="https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2">libgit2</a> <!-- -->- a cross-platform, linkable Git library written in C,</li><li><a href="https://github.com/isomorphic-git/isomorphic-git">isomorphic-git</a> <!-- -->- a pure JavaScript implementation of Git.</li></ol><p>We judged that it would be easier to start with isomorphic-git, but that the initial up-front investment in making libgit2 work might pay off more significantly, since libgit2 is used much more widely and is more battle-hardened. Prior to our attempts, other developers had already made libgit2 work in Node.js and browsers (see<!-- --> <a href="https://github.com/petersalomonsen/wasm-git">wasm-git</a>), which further encouraged us that we were on the right path.</p><p>We ended up compiling libgit2 with Emscripten and packaging it for Cloudflare Workers.</p><p>Git uses the filesystem as its underlying storage, so the next step was to implement a filesystem on top of Durable Objects. A big hurdle we encountered at this point was how I/O is handled in modern JavaScript (using promises or async/await) versus how filesystem I/O is expected to work in Emscripten (synchronous system calls). Emscripten offers two mechanisms for using asynchronous JavaScript function calls in synchronous C functions:<!-- --> <a href="https://emscripten.org/docs/porting/asyncify.html">JSPI and Asyncify</a>. After extensive research, we rewrote significant parts of Emscripten to support asynchronous file system calls. We ended up creating our own Emscripten filesystem on top of Durable Objects, which we call DOFS. Having a filesystem on Durable Objects is very useful for running a Git server, but it also unlocks many other interesting possibilities (we will write about this in the future).</p><p><img src="https://gitlip.com/images/blog/infinite-git-repos-on-cloudflare-workers/image-00.svg" alt=""></p><h3>Implementing a Git server</h3><p>Compiling libgit2 to Wasm and implementing a filesystem on top of Durable Objects was a good start, but we needed to do more work to make the entire project useful. At this point, our Git implementation in Cloudflare Workers could store a repo in a Durable Object and communicate with the outside world via custom HTTP operations (read file, list branches etc.), but it couldn’t communicate using the Git protocol, so we couldn’t use the Git command-line tool to fetch or push.</p><p>libgit2 is an excellent Git library, but it only provides client functionality; server functionality is missing. We couldn’t find any other implementations of Git server functionality on the web to use as a reference. While Git itself implements the server commands receive-pack and upload-pack, porting them to libgit2 proved impossible. The main reason was that the required server commands depended on numerous other source files, and the interfaces between these files appeared poorly defined. Edward Thomson, the maintainer of libgit2, has written<!-- --> <a href="https://www.edwardthomson.com/blog/libgit2-in-2024-the-past.html#and-then-theres-the-server">an excellent article on the history of libgit2</a>, detailing Git’s issues in more depth.</p><p>We abandoned the porting efforts and ended up implementing the missing Git server functionality ourselves by leveraging libgit2’s core functionality, studying all available documentation, and painstakingly investigating Git’s behavior. We also created an extensive integration test suite to ensure the robustness and performance of our Git server.</p><h3>Reproducible builds</h3><p>Compiling native libraries like libgit2 for a specific target platform requires a significant amount of preparation, especially when the library itself needs to be compiled with a modified version of the compiler. We found it cumbersome to maintain the repeatability of the entire build process by manually invoking build commands for each component. Luckily, amazing software built for this exact purpose already exists - enter<!-- --> <a href="https://nixos.org/">Nix</a>, a declarative, purely functional build system which enables reproducible builds.</p><p>We’ve built our build system by utilizing Nix. This allowed us to reproducibly build patched Emscripten, patched libgit2, and the C implementation of our Git server from scratch by invoking just a single command. Not only that, but Nix has also enabled us to fine-tune this build process and make it configurable with flags passed to the build command. We can now build our Git server from scratch targeting the native platform (Linux or Mac), Node.js, or Cloudflare Workers. We can also easily configure whether we want the release or development build of the entire package tree. Additionally, Nix allows us to build only a subtree of packages, enabling us to intervene mid-build to make necessary modifications. The learning curve for Nix is steep, but well worth it. If you’re interested in a similarly powerful tool that’s easier to get started with,<!-- --> <a href="https://flox.dev/">flox is an excellent option</a>.</p><p>We discovered a beautiful, initially unintended consequence of building our package tree with Nix: with a little bit of effort, we could compile a broad array of interesting native libraries to WebAssembly using our modified Emscripten compiler. So far, we’ve compiled zlib, libarchive, and libmagic to Wasm and statically linked them with our Git server. As a result, our Git server can create archives in many different formats (we currently only use zip and tar.gz) and easily detect MIME types for a vast array of stored files.<!-- --> <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs">Nixpkgs</a> <!-- -->is full of Nix scripts for building various software packages, and it was reasonably straightforward to adjust some of them to build to Wasm.</p><p>Finally, we also compiled<!-- --> <a href="https://bellard.org/quickjs/">QuickJS</a> <!-- -->to Wasm using our Nix build system. We use our QuickJS-based service to run JavaScript files with full support for ES modules’ import/export statements in Cloudflare Workers on-demand (more in the next section).</p><h3>Composable capabilities</h3><p>One of the core design principles in our codebase is to invest effort in building powerful, composable capabilities and curate them carefully in our repository. Having a strong set of these capabilities opens up interesting combinations especially when using a platform like Cloudflare Workers, which makes composition easy.</p><p><span>Example #1:</span> We developed our Git server with the intention of serving a single repository from a Durable Object, but after accomplishing this, it was very easy to package the same HTTP endpoints and Wasm and expose it from a plain Worker instead of a Durable Object. This way, we gained the ability to run the same exact Git code in either a persistent context (clients connect to the same Durable Object) or an ephemeral context (clients connect to any Worker closest to them). There are use cases where executing Git functionality in an ephemeral context is useful, and where sending the request to a Durable Object would be the wrong choice. For example, when validating a branch or tag name in the Web UI, there’s no need to reimplement these Git-specific rules in JavaScript if we can expose the exact upstream libgit2 behavior in the ephemeral Worker closest to the Web UI user.</p><p><span>Example #2:</span> If you visit<!-- --> <a href="https://gitlip.com/@nataliemarleny/test-repo/ref/HEAD/main.js">https://gitlip.com/@nataliemarleny/test-repo/ref/HEAD/main.js</a>, you’ll see an option to execute this file by pressing ’play’ on the right. Alternatively, here’s a quick video:</p><p><video height="200" width="100%" controls=""><source src="https://gitlip.com/images/blog/infinite-git-repos-on-cloudflare-workers/video-00.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video></p><p>Several of our composable capabilities work together to achieve the final result:</p><ol><li>api receives the request to execute main.js from the HEAD of the repo.</li><li>api coordinates the services (using<!-- --> <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/service-bindings/">service bindings</a>).</li><li>git-server service receives a request for an archive of the HEAD of the repo and streams the tar.gz snapshot of the HEAD back to the api.</li><li>api forwards the tar.gz stream to the js-run service (QuickJS-based).</li><li>js-run service unpacks the archive stream into memory.</li><li>js-run service runs the requested file from memory (note that main.js imports fizzbuzz.js!) and streams the response back to the api.</li><li>api streams the response back to the user.</li></ol><p><img src="https://gitlip.com/images/blog/infinite-git-repos-on-cloudflare-workers/image-01.svg" alt=""></p><p>For now, executing JavaScript in an on-demand manner like this is just a showcase of what we can easily achieve with our stack of capabilities, but in the future, we plan to make this more powerful by adding support for importing NPM modules and more.</p><h3>Optimizations</h3><p>Achieving predictable performance from our Git server required applying several optimization techniques. We’ll outline the most important ones.</p><p>Like any other serverless platform, Cloudflare Workers come with their own<!-- --> <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits/">set of constraints</a>. For the purposes of running a Git server, the most important ones are the Worker size (total size of the deployed code), memory, and CPU limit.</p><p><a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/workers-pricing-scale-to-zero/">In September 2023</a>, the Worker size limit on the Paid plan was increased from 1MB to 10MB, but Cloudflare still recommends keeping your entire deployment under 1MB for best performance. Our Wasm Git server, along with libgit2, all other libraries, and JavaScript glue code, fits in just 800kB, which we consider to be quite an achievement. We achieved this primarily by optimizing for code size during compilation and trimming the number of file formats our libmagic utility can detect.</p><p>The runtime limit of 128MB of memory initially posed a challenge. libgit2 makes heavy use of memory mapping when reading or writing objects to Git packfiles. Unfortunately, in a Wasm application compiled with Emscripten, memory mapping requires a completely new copy of the file in memory (even if the file is already in memory). This meant our Git server would copy the entire Git packfile into memory when reading even the smallest objects, causing the server’s performance to depend on the packfile size rather than the object size. We attempted to address this by modifying Emscripten, but it proved too difficult, so we opted to modify libgit2 instead. We removed all mmap equivalents and replaced them with read/write equivalents, and the results were incredible. We achieved performance independent of the packfile (repo) size. Note that memory mapping makes total sense in the typical settings for which libgit2 was designed.</p><p>Durable Objects are single-threaded, so one might think it would be difficult to efficiently serve concurrent requests to the same repository. Fortunately, the access patterns to a Git repository are well-suited for optimization with a cache. For this purpose we created a component called ConsistentCache, which wraps around Cloudflare’s HTTP Cache API (available in every Worker and Durable Object) and adds the necessary consistency guarantees. This component also deduplicates calls to the Git Wasm program, issuing a single call and relaying the response to all requestors in parallel. Using this technique, a significant number of requests to the Git server are fulfilled directly from the cache, and any modification to the repository purges this cache consistently.</p><p>Persistent storage in Durable Objects<!-- --> <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/durable-objects-easy-fast-correct-choose-three/#part-3-automatic-in-memory-caching">has its own built-in caching layer</a>, which improves overall performance and provides additional consistency guarantees. Unfortunately, all reads that hit this built-in cache are billed the same as accessing the underlying storage. libgit2 specifically, and Git more generally, often need to read small chunks of a file incrementally, resulting in a large number of small reads, which became somewhat expensive during testing. We decided to implement our own storage cache, called StorageEngine, and completely disable the built-in cache. This way, we pay nothing for most of the operations our Git server performs on DOFS, only incurring costs for the occasional flush that writes all inodes and file blocks to storage and for occasional reads that populate the StorageEngine.</p><p>Finally, we optimized the implementation of our bare Git repositories to always contain a very limited (mostly constant) number of directories. This allowed us to preload all directories and pack-index files from the persistent storage (depending on the repo between 20 and 60, each up to a few kB in size) every time the Durable Object is instantiated, effectively pre-warming the repository for any Git command it might receive.</p><pre><code>(log) StorageEngine.get (1/1): [HTTP_CACHE_LRU_MAP]

Small read and write operations (think a typical README.md) over HTTP complete in under 150 ms, even without caching and regardless of the repository size.</p><h3>Limitations</h3><p>For now, our Git server is well-suited for repositories up to about 100 MB in size, which is more than enough for our specific use case. Beyond 100 MB, we encounter a few issues:</p><ol><li>Single-threaded packing and unpacking of Git packfiles during clone, fetch, and push operations exceeds the time limit on requests to Workers if the packfiles are too large.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/1254">Fetch body streams are not full duplex</a>, which unfortunately means that while we can theoretically clone and push any repository in our Git server, we may not be able to fetch from it. This is because the fetch operation in Git’s smart protocol requires a full duplex channel for negotiating the optimal packfile to send. Fortunately, in repositories with up to 32 refs, this negotiation process never occurs.</li><li>Cloudflare Workers support only HTTPs for now - so we can’t support cloning, fetching and pushing over SSH without meaningfully complicating our infrastructure.</li></ol><p>We believe the above limitations are solvable in the long term, and that in the future, we could adjust our Git server to handle repositories of arbitrary size and support SSH.</p><h3>Demo</h3><p>To preview this in production, feel free to explore our Gitlip public profiles:</p><ol><li><a href="https://gitlip.com/@nataliemarleny">https://gitlip.com/@nataliemarleny</a></li><li><a href="https://gitlip.com/@plesiv">https://gitlip.com/@plesiv</a></li></ol><p>Please note that the current performance is constrained by the fact that our primary database is not hosted on Cloudflare, and calls to it dominate the latency of most requests. We expect to reduce the overall latency of most requests by 50% to 75% through further optimizations, which we’ll write about in the future.</p><h3>Future</h3><p>Having a serverless and infinitely horizontally scalable Git server infrastructure opens many possibilities for products built on top of it. We believe Git is underutilized for storage purposes, given its versioning capabilities and the fact that it stores plain files, which can be in any format suitable for the application.</p><p>An additional benefit of achieving a performant Git server in JavaScript and Wasm is the fact that our server already mostly works directly in the browser itself.

            <span>Abstract:</span>This paper proves that Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm is universally optimal in both its running time and number of comparisons when combined with a sufficiently efficient heap data structure.
<br>Universal optimality is a powerful beyond-worst-case performance guarantee for graph algorithms that informally states that a single algorithm performs as well as possible for every single graph topology. We give the first application of this notion to any sequential algorithm.
<br>We design a new heap data structure with a working-set property guaranteeing that the heap takes advantage of locality in heap operations. Our heap matches the optimal (worst-case) bounds of Fibonacci heaps but also provides the beyond-worst-case guarantee that the cost of extracting the minimum element is merely logarithmic in the number of elements inserted after it instead of logarithmic in the number of all elements in the heap. This makes the extraction of recently added elements cheaper.
<br>We prove that our working-set property is sufficient to guarantee universal optimality, specifically, for the problem of ordering vertices by their distance from the source vertex: The locality in the sequence of heap operations generated by any run of Dijkstra's algorithm on a fixed topology is strong enough that one can couple the number of comparisons performed by any heap with our working-set property to the minimum number of comparisons required to solve the distance ordering problem on this topology.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This post aims at giving an overview of what SELinux is, how it is implemented, and how to bypass it, from the point of view of Android kernel exploitation.</p><p>Tests were performed on three devices: a Samsung Galaxy A34, a Huawei Mate 20 Pro, and a Xiaomi Redmi Note 12. We will focus mainly on the first two, because they have a hypervisor that will make privilege escalation and bypassing SELinux more difficult.</p><p>Code shown is from Linux kernel 5.15, with relevant notes for older versions in some cases.</p><h2 id="what-is-selinux"><span>What is SELinux</span><a href="#what-is-selinux"><i></i></a></h2><p>SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux) is a Linux kernel <strong>security module</strong> that implements a <strong>Mandatory Access Control</strong> (MAC) mechanism to enforce a given <strong>security policy</strong>. Let’s break this down step by step.</p><h3 id="linux-security-module"><span>Linux Security Module</span><a href="#linux-security-module"><i></i></a></h3><p>Linux Security Modules (LSM) is a framework that allows defining modules that implement security checks. It mainly provides two things:</p><ul><li>It inserts a <strong>security</strong> field into some critical kernel data structures. This field is an opaque <code>void*</code> pointer that is managed by the modules. Some structs that have this field are <code>struct task_struct</code>, <code>struct cred</code>, <code>struct inode</code>, <code>struct file</code>, etc.</li><li>It inserts calls to <strong>hooks</strong> at critical points in the kernel code for modules to manage the security fields and to perform access control. SELinux hooks are defined <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.15.41/source/security/selinux/hooks.c#L7132">here</a>.<ul><li>For example, <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.15.41/source/fs/file_table.c#L96"><code>__alloc_file()</code></a>, which is the function responsible of allocating a <code>struct file</code>, calls <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.15.41/source/security/security.c#L1526"><code>security_file_alloc()</code></a>, which first allocates the <code>f_security</code> field <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.15.41/source/security/security.c#L572">here</a>, and then calls the <code>file_alloc_security</code> hooks to initialize it (e.g. <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.15.41/source/security/selinux/hooks.c#L3712"><code>selinux_file_alloc_security()</code></a>).</li><li>Another example: the <code>open</code> syscall ends up calling <code>do_dentry_open()</code>, which calls <code>security_file_open()</code> <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.15.41/source/fs/open.c#L809">here</a>. This function calls the <code>file_open</code> hooks, which are supposed to use the <code>f_security</code> field that was previously initialized to perform permission checks (e.g. <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.15.41/source/security/selinux/hooks.c#L4017"><code>selinux_file_open()</code></a>). If the check fails, the <code>open</code> syscall will return <code>-EACCES</code>.</li><li>Note that there may be multiple modules, each providing its own hook functions. Modules call <code>security_add_hooks()</code> on initialization (e.g. from <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.15.41/source/security/selinux/hooks.c#L7430"><code>selinux_init()</code></a>) to add their own hooks to the global <code>security_hook_heads</code>, which contains a list of functions for each type of hook. Macros <code>call_void_hook()</code> and <code>call_int_hook()</code> are used to call hooks, and they iterate the list that corresponds to the hook and call each function.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="mandatory-access-control"><span>Mandatory Access Control</span><a href="#mandatory-access-control"><i></i></a></h3><p>The usual permission system in Linux is <strong>Discretionary Access Control</strong> (DAC), where permissions rely solely on the user/group of each process, which is checked against the user, group and others permissions of each file. In addition, there’s the root user, which has permission to do everything.</p><p>In contrast, SELinux implements <strong>Mandatory Access Control</strong> (MAC), a more fine-grained permission system that checks permissions according to a predefined policy when doing any sensitive action with a file, socket, inode, binder object, etc. This allows giving each process only the minimum privilege level it needs to work. It also means that root access can’t do everything anymore, as it is bound to the <a href="#selinux-contexts">SELinux context</a> it is using.</p><h3 id="selinux-policy"><span>SELinux policy</span><a href="#selinux-policy"><i></i></a></h3><p>Some concepts:</p><ul><li>SELinux assigns a <strong>type</strong> to every object (files, processes, sockets, etc). For example, by default an app has the type <code>untrusted_app</code>. For a process, its type is also known as its <strong>domain</strong>.</li><li>It’s possible to assign <strong>attributes</strong> to a type, making it possible to refer to all types that have an attribute.</li><li>Objects are also mapped to <strong>classes</strong>, which indicates if they are a file, a process, a directory, etc.</li></ul><p><strong>SELinux contexts</strong> or <strong>labels</strong> have the format <code>user:role:type:sensitivity[:categories]</code>, with the type being the most important part. When running <code>id</code> from <code>adb shell</code>, it will show our context as <code>u:r:shell:s0</code>. However, when doing it from an app, it will show something like <code>u:r:untrusted_app:s0:c15,c256,c513,c768</code>. This determines our permissions. Files also have a label associated with them, and they can be printed if we add the <code>-Z</code> option to <code>ls</code>:</p><div file="Console"><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><p>SELinux hook functions check the requested permission against a <strong>policy</strong>. This policy defines what resources each process can access. It is made of <strong>rules</strong>, which come in the form: <code>allow source target:class permissions;</code>, where <em>source</em> and <em>target</em> are types or attributes. Here’s an example of a rule from a real device:</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>allow untrusted_app gpu_device:chr_file { append getattr ioctl lock map open read write };
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><p>This rule says that processes with domain <code>untrusted_app</code> (which is the default for an Android app) can open, read, write, map, and perform ioctl on files of type <code>gpu_device</code>, such as the <code>/dev/mali0</code> file above, which is the character device for interacting with the Mali GPU driver. Note that by default, everything is denied unless there’s a rule that allows it.</p><p>Android SELinux policy is defined in the <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/sepolicy/+/main"><code>system/sepolicy</code></a> repository and compiled to a binary file, which can be accessed in the device at <code>/sys/fs/selinux/policy</code>. That policy file can be easily inspected from the host. For example, to list everything accessible from untrusted app context:</p><div file="Console"><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

She implemented the aforementioned workflow in order to load a new SELinux policy. Therefore, she only needed to overwrite the AVC cache at most twice (to <code>open</code> and <code>write</code> on <code>/sys/fs/selinux/load</code>). After that, the injected SELinux policy takes effect, which can contain rules to allow any action.</p><blockquote><p>This doesn’t work on my Huawei device. As noted <a href="https://blog.impalabs.com/2212_huawei-security-hypervisor.html#selinux-protection">here</a>, SELinux data structures are allocated from a memory pool that is later made read-only, making loading a new policy impossible. The AVC cache is not allocated from that memory pool, so it can still be overwritten. But without any other more consistent mechanism to disable SELinux, this is pretty much useless.

A regular memory write primitive won’t work.</p><div file="security/security.c"><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre><span>struct</span> <span>security_hook_heads</span> <span>security_hook_heads</span> <span>__lsm_ro_after_init</span><span>;</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><p>However, if there is no hypervisor, there are ways to write to read-only memory. First, if we have a physical memory write primitive we can just write to it, as it writes to the underlying physical memory, ignoring virtual memory protections. Otherwise, if we have a virtual memory write primitive, we could modify the protections of that page by modifying the kernel page table (<code>swapper_pg_dir</code>), or maybe map that page to another virtual address with read-write permissions.</p><p>On the other side, if there is a hypervisor underneath, it may not be possible to write to read-only memory from the kernel. This is because the physical address obtained from the kernel page tables is actually an Intermediate Physical Address (IPA), which may be mapped to the real physical address as read-only in the second stage page tables in the hypervisor, as explained <a href="https://blog.impalabs.com/2212_huawei-security-hypervisor.html#arm-virtualization-extensions">here</a> and <a href="https://blog.longterm.io/samsung_rkp.html#hypervisor-crash-course">here</a>.</p><blockquote><p>Truth is, I have managed to write to <code>security_hook_heads</code> on both my Samsung and Huawei devices, which supposedly protect read-only memory from the hypervisor. On my Samsung device, I believe it is because they don’t protect “read-only after init” memory, as they don’t do any call to the hypervisor from <code>mark_rodata_ro()</code>, the function in charge of changing permissions of <code>__ro_after_init</code> memory to read-only. On my Huawei device, they did modify <code>mark_rodata_ro()</code> to perform hypercalls to also mark that memory as read-only in the second stage page tables, as shown <a href="https://blog.impalabs.com/2212_huawei-security-hypervisor.html#kernel-read-only-data">here</a>. However, I believe the memory write primitive I was using in my test exploit bypasses this because memory access is performed from the GPU, instead of from the CPU. This may have been patched on more modern devices.</p></blockquote><p>Even when we can write to read-only memory, one must be careful when modifying <code>security_hook_heads</code>. Just emptying every list and removing every hook didn’t work for me. It crashed with some NULL point deref because of a hook accessing a NULL <code>security</code> field. However, I believe by removing the correct hooks, it’s possible to get a stable SELinux bypass, as the post explains.</p><p>Note this can also be used to perform privilege escalation. Syscall <code>setresuid()</code> checks permissions with <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.15.41/source/kernel/sys.c#L680"><code>ns_capable_setid()</code></a>, which ends up calling <code>security_capable()</code>, which simply calls the hook <code>capable</code>. So if we empty the list <code>security_hook_heads.capable</code>, then those permission checks won’t be performed, and we can just do <code>setresuid(0, 0, 0)</code> to get root. Something similar is implemented <a href="https://github.com/chompie1337/s8_2019_2215_poc/blob/master/poc/dac_bypass.c">here</a> by chompie1337.</p><blockquote><p>In theory, this shouldn’t work on my Samsung and Huawei devices, because they have some methods to detect privilege escalations and abort them. However, my Huawei device fails to detect this privilege escalation. I believe this is because, as shown <a href="https://blog.impalabs.com/2212_huawei-security-hypervisor.html#privilege-escalation-detection">here</a>, it stores a protected bitmap indicating if each process is root or not. Then, at certain points, it calls <code>hkip_check_xid_root()</code> to check if the task is now root but wasn’t before according to the bitmap, and kills it in that case. However, that bitmap is updated with <code>hkip_update_xid_root()</code> from <code>commit_creds()</code>, which is <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.15.41/source/kernel/sys.c#L715">called</a> from syscall <code>setresuid()</code>. So if we manage to bypass the permission checks present by default in that syscall as we are doing by overwriting <code>security_hook_heads.capable</code>, then the hypervisor will happily update the bitmap and allow the privilege escalation. Similarly, this privilege escalation method also worked on my Samsung device, but I didn’t further explore the reasons why Samsung DEFEX failed.</p></blockquote><h2 id="conclusion"><span>Conclusion</span><a href="#conclusion"><i></i></a></h2><p>I hope you enjoyed the post and learnt something new.

For instance, your phone's camera uses AI to process images and blur backgrounds in Portrait mode, and Siri and Google Assistant have always been AI-based (albeit using less advanced versions of the tech). But because this new wave of AI introduces ways to more explicitly accomplish tasks on your phone, rather than blending into existing features, it may take some time for people to warm up to.</p><h2>AI could soon cost you -- and not everyone is sold</h2><p>As tech giants continue to roll out these AI functions, consumers may soon have to pay the price if they want to keep using them. Samsung's website says its Galaxy AI features "will be provided for free until the end of 2025 on supported Samsung Galaxy devices." To utilize Gemini's full power across Google's apps, you'll need to subscribe to <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/google-gemini-advanced-review-dont-cancel-your-chatgpt-plus-subscription/" target="_self" rel="follow">Gemini Advanced</a>. And it's likely Apple could also someday&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/apple-intelligence-may-eventually-cost-you/" rel="follow" target="_self">charge for some of its AI-powered iPhone features</a>.</p><p>Many <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/subscription-fatigue-ai-phone-features-will-soon-cost-us-why-im-not-sold/" target="_self" rel="follow">consumers aren't sold</a>. Nearly half of smartphone owners say they're not willing to pay extra money to access AI on their phones. That's not much of a surprise, given how much subscription fatigue is already weighing people down. Another&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/subscription-creep-costs-us-consumers-more-than-1000-a-year-cnet-survey-finds/" rel="follow" target="_self">CNET study</a>&nbsp;from April found that US adults spend an average of $91 on subscription services every month. Two-thirds of respondents said at least one of their subscriptions got more expensive within the last year. Adding yet another monthly fee, therefore, may not be so enticing.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, there are those who are eager to tap into AI on their phones, with Gen Zers and Millennials being the most enthused: 20% of respondents from each generation say they're excited about AI capabilities and find them helpful. Additionally, 15% of Gen Zers and 16% of Millennials use AI on their phones for tasks like photo editing, image creation and summarizing or writing text. Also, 20% of Gen Zers and 19% of Millennials regularly use an AI tool like ChatGPT or Google Gemini on their smartphones.&nbsp;</p><p>Privacy remains a key concern when it comes to AI, with one-third (34%) of smartphone owners flagging their unease in that department. Tech giants have placed a growing emphasis on privacy considerations during their AI-focused keynotes. At its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnet.com/news-live/apple-wwdc-6-10-2024-live-blog/" rel="follow" target="_self">Worldwide Developers Conference</a>&nbsp;in June, for instance, Apple noted many of its <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/apple-intelligence-brings-ai-to-the-iphone-with-chatgpt-integration-and-more/" target="_self" rel="follow">AI models run on-device</a>, which is generally considered more private, since information doesn't have to travel over the internet. When a task calls for more computational power, relevant data will be sent to <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/apple-says-its-ai-sets-a-new-standard-for-privacy-invites-security-experts-to-test-it/" target="_self" rel="follow">Apple Silicon servers</a>, and that data <a href="https://www.apple.com/gn/newsroom/2024/06/apple-extends-its-privacy-leadership-with-new-updates-across-its-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">won't be stored</a> or made accessible to Apple, the company says.&nbsp;</p><h2>The biggest reasons to upgrade a phone</h2><p>With AI being among the last reasons consumers want to upgrade their smartphones, other considerations like longer battery life, more storage and better camera features still dominate. Other motivators include phone display and screen size (32%); keeping the same ecosystem, like iOS or Android (24%); and phone color (10%).&nbsp;</p><p>With the high cost of devices (many flagship phones will cost you anywhere between $800 and $1,200), consumers may not want to <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/getting-a-new-iphone-every-2-years-is-making-less-sense-than-ever/" target="_self" rel="follow">upgrade their devices as frequently</a>. According to our survey, 44% claim they only get a new device when their current phone breaks or needs replacing.

But consumers still feel lukewarm about the concept of a foldable handheld device. Just over half (52%) of smartphone owners say they're not interested in buying a foldable phone, while 13% say they'd be interested sometime in the next two years.</p><p>That gives Apple, which has yet to enter the foldable phone space, the opportunity to tap into that interest.

        <h2>Strategy Tips</h2>
        <p>
            If you get stuck during a game, these rules / tips can help:
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Only-spots-left rule:</strong> if a row has e.g. 3 boat squares and
            all but 3 squares are water, the rest must be boats:
        </p>
        <div>
            <p><img src="https://lukerissacher.com/static/images/battleships/only_spots_left.png?v=1518899129">
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            <strong>The-rest-is-water rule:</strong> likewise, if a row already has the
            required number of boats (including 0), the rest is water:
        </p>
        <div>
            <p><img src="https://lukerissacher.com/static/images/battleships/rest_is_water.png?v=1518899297">
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            Tip: you can click on these numbers to auto-fill water.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Water-on-corners rule:</strong> since ships can't touch diagonally,
            you can always set the corners around a boat square to water:
        </p>
        <div>
            <p><img src="https://lukerissacher.com/static/images/battleships/fill_corners.png?v=1518899520">
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            <strong>Surround-whole-boats rule:</strong> if you know where a 
            whole boat is, you can surround it completely with water:
        </p>
        <div>
            <p><img src="https://lukerissacher.com/static/images/battleships/surround.png?v=1518899945">
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            <strong>Only-place-it-could-fit rule:</strong> often there's only one spot
            left on the board that the largest ship could fit:
        </p>
        <div>
            <p><img src="https://lukerissacher.com/static/images/battleships/only_fit.png?v=1518900280">

		<p><em>By Alan Cao</em></p>
<p>If you love exploit mitigations, you may have heard of a new system call named <code>mseal</code> landing into the Linux kernel’s 6.10 release, providing a protection called “memory sealing.” Beyond notes from the authors, very little information about this mitigation exists. In this blog post, we’ll explain what this syscall is, including how it’s different from prior memory protection schemes and how it works in the kernel to protect virtual memory. We’ll also describe the particular exploit scenarios that <code>mseal</code> helps stop in Linux userspace, such as stopping malicious permissions tampering and preventing memory unmapping attacks.</p>
<h3>What mseal is (and isn’t)</h3>
<p>Memory sealing allows developers to make memory regions immutable from illicit modifications during program runtime. When a virtual memory address (VMA) range is sealed, an attacker with a code execution primitive cannot perform subsequent virtual memory operations to change the VMA’s permissions or modify how it is laid out for their benefit.</p>
<p>If you’re like me and followed the <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAHk-=wh+6n6f0zuezKem+W=aytHMv2bib6Fbrg-xnWOoujFb6g@mail.gmail.com/">spicy discourse</a>&nbsp;surrounding this syscall in the kernel mailing lists, you may have observed that Chrome’s Security team introduced it to support their <a href="https://v8.dev/blog/control-flow-integrity">V8 CFI strategy</a>, initially for Linux-based ChromeOS. After some lengthy deliberation and several rewrites, it finally landed in the kernel, with plans to expand its use case beyond browsers with <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/978010/">its integration into glibc, possibly in version 2.41</a>.</p>
<p><code>mseal</code>’s security guarantees are unlike Linux’s <code>memfd_create</code> and its <code>memfd_secret</code> variant, which provide file sealing. <code>memfd_create</code> and <code>memfd_secret</code> allow one to create RAM-backed anonymous files as an alternative to storing content to <code>tmpfs</code>, with <code>memfd_secret</code> taking it a step further by ensuring that the region of memory is accessible only to the process holding the file descriptor. This lets developers create “secure enclave”-style userspace mappings that can guard sensitive in-memory data.</p>
<p><code>mseal</code> digresses from prior memory protection schemes on Linux because it is a syscall tailored specifically for <em>exploit mitigation</em> against remote attackers seeking code execution rather than potentially local ones looking to exfiltrate sensitive secrets in-memory.</p>
<p>To understand <code>mseal</code>’s security mitigations, we must first study its implementation to understand how it operates. Luckily, <code>mseal</code> is simple to understand, so let’s look at how it works in the kernel!</p>
<h3>A look under the hood</h3>
<p><code>mseal</code> has a simple function signature:</p>
<pre><span>int</span> mseal(<span>unsigned</span> long start, size_t len, <span>unsigned long</span> flags)
</pre>
<ul>
<li><code>start</code> and <code>len</code> represent the start/end range of a valid VMA that we want to seal, and len must be properly page-aligned.</li>
<li><code>flags</code> are unused at the time of writing and must be set to 0.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the 6.12 kernel, its syscall definition calls <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.12-rc3/source/mm/mseal.c#L212"><code>do_mseal</code></a>:</p>
<pre><span>static</span> <span>int</span> do_mseal(<span>unsigned long</span> start, size_t len_in, <span>unsigned long</span> flags)
{
    size_t len;
    <span>int</span> ret = <span>0</span>;
    <span>unsigned long</span> end;
    <span>struct</span> mm_struct *mm = current-&gt;mm;     <span>// [1]</span>

    <span>// ... Check flags == 0, check page alignment, and compute `end`</span>

    <span>if</span> (mmap_write_lock_killable(mm))          <span>// [2]</span>
        <span>return</span> -EINTR;

    /*
     * First pass, <span>this</span> helps to avoid
     * partial sealing in <span>case</span> of <span>error</span> in input address range,
     * e.g. ENOMEM <span>error</span>.
     */
    ret = check_mm_seal(start, end);            <span>// [3]</span>
    <span>if</span> (ret)
        <span>goto</span> out;

    /*
     * Second pass, <span>this</span> should success, unless there are errors
     * from vma_modify_flags, e.g. merge/split <span>error</span>, or process
     * reaching the max supported VMAs, however, those cases shall
     * be rare.
     */
    ret = apply_mm_seal(start, end);            <span>// [4]</span> 

out:
    mmap_write_unlock(current-&gt;mm);
    <span>return</span> ret;
}
</pre>
<p><code>do_mseal</code> will first compute an <code>end</code> offset from the provided length and lock the memory region <code>[2]</code> to prevent concurrent access to the page. The global <code>current</code> at <code>[1]</code> represents the current executing <code>task_struct</code> (i.e., the process invoking <code>mseal</code>). The referenced field is the <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.12-rc3/source/include/linux/mm_types.h#L790"><code>mm_struct</code></a> representing the task’s entire virtual memory address space. The critical field in <code>mm_struct</code> on which this syscall will operate is <code>mmap</code>, a list of <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.12-rc3/source/include/linux/mm_types.h#L667"><code>vm_area_struct</code></a> values. This represents a single contiguous memory region created by <code>mmap</code>, such as the stack or VDSO.</p>
<p>The <code>check_mm_seal</code> call at <code>[3]</code> ensures that the targeted memory map for sealing is a valid range by iterating over each VMA from <code>current-&gt;mm</code> to test boundary correctness.</p>
<pre><span>static</span> <span>int</span> check_mm_seal(<span>unsigned long</span> start, <span>unsigned long</span> end)
{
    <span>struct</span> vm_area_struct *vma;
    <span>unsigned long</span> nstart = start;

    VMA_ITERATOR(vmi, current-&gt;mm, start);

    /* going through each vma to check. */
    for_each_vma_range(vmi, vma, end) {
        <span>if</span> (vma-&gt;vm_start &gt; nstart)
            /* unallocated memory found. */
            <span>return</span> -ENOMEM;
        <span>if</span> (vma-&gt;vm_end &gt;= end)
            <span>return</span> <span>0</span>;

        nstart = vma-&gt;vm_end;
    }
    <span>return</span> -ENOMEM;
}
</pre>
<p>The magic happens in the <code>apply_mm_seal</code> call <code>[4]</code>, which walks over each VMA again and arranges for the targeted region to have an additional <code>VM_SEALED</code> flag through the <code>mseal_fixup</code> call:</p>
<pre><span>static</span> <span>int</span> apply_mm_seal(<span>unsigned long</span> start, <span>unsigned long</span> end)
{
    // ...
    nstart = start;
    for_each_vma_range(vmi, vma, end) {
        <span>int</span> <span>error</span>;
        <span>unsigned long</span> tmp;
        vm_flags_t newflags;

        newflags = vma-&gt;vm_flags | VM_SEALED;
        tmp = vma-&gt;vm_end;
        <span>if</span> (tmp &gt; end)
            tmp = end;
        <span>error</span> = mseal_fixup(vmi, vma, &amp;prev, nstart, tmp, newflags);
        <span>if</span> (<span>error</span>)
            <span>return error</span>;
        nstart = vma_iter_end(&amp;vmi);
    }
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span>;
}
</pre>
<p>To ensure that unwanted memory operations respect this new flag, the <code>mseal</code> patchset adds <code>VM_SEALED</code> checks to the following files:</p>
<pre><span> mm/madvise.c                                |   12 +
 mm/mmap.c                                   |   31 +-
 mm/mprotect.c                               |   10 +
 mm/mremap.c                                 |   31 +
 mm/mseal.c                                  |  307 ++++
</span></pre>
<p>For instance, <code>mprotect</code> and <code>pkey_mprotect</code> will enforce this check when it eventually invokes <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.12-rc3/source/mm/mprotect.c#L614"><code>mprotect_fixup</code></a>:</p>
<pre><span>int</span>
mprotect_fixup(..., <span>struct</span> vm_area_struct *vma, ...)
{
    <span>// ...</span>
    <span>if</span> (!can_modify_vma(vma))
        <span>return</span> -EPERM;
    }
    <span>// ...</span>
}
</pre>
<p>To determine whether the syscall should continue, <code>can_modify_vma</code>—defined in <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.12-rc3/source/mm/vma.h#L534"><code>mm/vma.h</code></a>—will test for the existence of <code>VM_SEALED</code> in the specified <code>vm_area_struct</code>:</p>
<pre><span>static inline</span> bool vma_is_sealed(<span>struct</span> vm_area_struct *vma)
{
    <span>return</span> (vma-&gt;vm_flags &amp; VM_SEALED);
}

/*
 * check <span>if</span> a vma is sealed <span>for</span> modification.
 * <span>return</span> true, <span>if</span> modification is allowed.
 */
<span>static inline</span> bool can_modify_vma(<span>struct</span> vm_area_struct *vma)
{
    <span>if</span> (unlikely(vma_is_sealed(vma)))
        <span>return</span> false;

    <span>return</span> true;
}
</pre>
<p>From the changes in other memory-management syscalls, we can determine the operations that are not permitted on a VMA after it is sealed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changing permission bits with <code>mprotect</code> and <code>pkey_mprotect</code></li>
<li>Unmapping with <code>munmap</code></li>
<li>Replacement of a sealed map with <code>mmap</code>(<code>MAP_FIXED</code>) with another one that is mutable/unsealed</li>
<li>Expanding or shrinking its size with <code>mremap</code>. Shrinking to zero could create a refillable hole for a new mapping with no sealing, as it triggers an unmap altogether.</li>
<li>Migrating to a new destination with <code>mremap(MREMAP_MAYMOVE | MREMAP_FIXED)</code>. Note that sealing checks are imposed on both the source and destination VMAs. Also, the source VMA will be unmapped if <code>MREMAP_DONTUNMAP</code> is not supplied, but the <code>munmap</code> sealing check will still apply.</li>
<li>Calling <code>madvise</code> with the <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.12-rc3/source/mm/mseal.c#L26-#L32">following destructive flags</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For now, one can invoke <code>mseal</code> on a 6.10+ kernel through a direct syscall invocation. Here’s a basic wrapper implementation to help you get started:</p>
<pre>#<span>include</span> &lt;sys/syscall.h&gt;
#<span>include</span> <span>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</span>

#define MSEAL_SYSCALL <span>462</span>

<span>long</span> mseal(<span>unsigned long</span> start, size_t len)
{
    <span>int</span> page_size;
    uintptr_t page_aligned_start;

    /* how large a page should be on our system (<span>default</span>: <span>4096</span> bytes) */
    page_size = getpagesize();

    /* page align the VMA range we want to seal */
    page_aligned_start = start &amp; ~(page_size - 1);
    <span>return</span> syscall(MSEAL_SYSCALL, page_aligned_start, len, <span>0</span>);
}
</pre>
<h3>What exploit techniques does mseal help mitigate?</h3>
<p>From the disallowed operations, we can discern two particular exploit scenarios that memory sealing will prevent:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tampering with a VMA’s permissions. Notably, not allowing executable permissions to be set can stop the revival of shellcode-based attacks.</li>
<li>“Hole-punching” through arbitrary unmapping/remapping of a memory region, mitigating data-only exploits that take advantage of refilling memory regions with attacker-controlled data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s examine these scenarios in more detail, and the defense-in-depth strategies developers can employ in their software implementations.</p>
<h4>Hardening NX</h4>
<p>Even with the continued existence of code reuse techniques like ROP, attackers may prefer to gain shellcoding capability during exploitation; this can provide a stable and “easy win,” especially if constraints are imposed on the gadget chain. Here is a potential workflow to achieve this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Through some target functionality, spray shellcode onto a non-executable stack/heap region.</li>
<li>Exploit the target’s bug to kick off an initial ROP chain to call <code>mprotect</code> with <code>PROT_EXEC</code> to target the region holding the shellcode and turn off the NX bit.</li>
<li>Jump to it to revive old-school shellcoding!</li>
</ul>
<p>The exploit for <a href="https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/146795/MikroTik-RouterOS-SMB-Buffer-Overflow.html">CVE-2018-7445</a> targeting Mikrotik RouterOS’s SMB daemon is a notable example. A socket-based shellcode is sprayed onto the non-executable heap, and the crafted ROP chain from a stack overflow modifies heap memory permissions before executing shellcode.</p>
<p>The most straightforward use case for memory sealing is disallowing VMA permission modification; once that happens, exploits that want to take advantage of traditional shellcode won’t be able to switch off executable bits.</p>
<p>As mentioned, <code>mseal</code> will be introduced in glibc 2.41+, where the dynamic loader will apply sealing across a <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/978010/">predetermined set of VMAs</a>. However, at the time of writing, this will <em>not be done automatically for the stack or heap</em>.</p>
<p>This is expected because these regions can expand during runtime. For instance, a heap allocator that wants to reclaim space will invoke the <code>brk</code> syscall, which could call <code>arch_unmap</code> and eventually <code>do_vmi_unmap</code> to perform shrinking. Of course, this would be disallowed under sealing and thus break dynamic memory allocation for the application altogether.</p>
<p>So, for now, the software developer is responsible for protecting these regions, as they have the context to determine when and where sealing should be applied appropriately.</p>
<p>Let’s use <code>mseal</code> to enhance the stack’s old-school NX (non-executable) protection. Here’s a simple example that emulates the scenario mentioned above:</p>
<pre><span>int</span> main(<span>void</span>)
{
    /* represents the stack that now contains /bin/sh shellcode we somehow sprayed */
    <span>unsigned char</span> exec_shellcode[] =
<span>"\xe1\x45\x8c\xd2\x21\xcd\xad\xf2\xe1\x65\xce\xf2\x01\x0d\xe0\xf2"
"\xe1\x8f\x1f\xf8\xe1\x03\x1f\xaa\xe2\x03\x1f\xaa\xe0\x63\x21\x8b"
"\xa8\x1b\x80\xd2\xe1\x66\x02\xd4";</span>

    <span>// vulnerability triggered, hijacked instruction pointer</span>

    /* ======= what our ROP chain would do: ======= */


    /* compute the start of the page <span>for</span> the shellcode */
    <span>void</span> (*exec_ptr)() =  (<span>void</span>(*)())&amp;exec_shellcode;
    <span>void</span> *exec_offset = (<span>void</span> *)((int64_t) exec_ptr &amp; ~(getpagesize() - 1));

    mprotect(exec_offset, getpagesize(), PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE|PROT_EXEC);

    /* <span>this</span> now works! */
    exec_ptr();
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span>;
}
</pre>
<p>As we’d expect, setting <code>PROT_EXEC</code> on the VMA permits <code>exec_shellcode</code> to become executable again:</p>
<pre><span>~ gcc stack_no_sealing.c -o stack_no_sealing
~ ./stack_no_sealing
$
</span></pre>
<p>Let’s introduce memory sealing on the stack-based <code>exec_offset</code> VMA range:</p>
<pre><span>int</span> main(<span>void</span>)
{
    /* represents the stack that now contains /bin/sh shellcode we somehow sprayed */
    <span>unsigned char</span> exec_shellcode[] =
"\xe1\x45\x8c\xd2\x21\xcd\xad\xf2\xe1\x65\xce\xf2\x01\x0d\xe0\xf2"
"\xe1\x8f\x1f\xf8\xe1\x03\x1f\xaa\xe2\x03\x1f\xaa\xe0\x63\x21\x8b"
"\xa8\x1b\x80\xd2\xe1\x66\x02\xd4";

    /* compute the start of the page <span>for</span> the shellcode */
    <span>void</span> (*exec_ptr)() =  (<span>void</span>(*)())&amp;exec_shellcode;
    <span>void</span> *exec_offset = (<span>void</span> *)((int64_t) exec_ptr &amp; ~(getpagesize() - 1));

    /* seal the stack page containing the shellcode! */
    <span>if</span> (mseal(exec_offset, getpagesize()) &lt; <span>0</span>)
        handle_error(<span>"mseal"</span>);

    <span>// vulnerability triggered, hijacked instruction pointer</span>

    /* ======= what our ROP chain would <span>do</span>: ======= */

    mprotect(exec_offset, getpagesize(), PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE|PROT_EXEC);
    /* segfault now, as no permission change actually occurred */
    exec_ptr();
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span>;
}
</pre>
<p>The aforementioned <code>can_modify_vma</code> check kicks in when <code>mprotect</code> is called, preventing the permission change from ever happening, and the attempt to shellcode now fails:</p>
<pre><span>~ gcc stack_with_sealing.c -o stack_with_sealing
~ ./stack_with_sealing
[1]    48771 segmentation fault (core dumped)  ./stack_with_sealing
</span></pre>
<p>A simple strategy to accommodate real-world software could involve sparingly introducing a macro-ized version of the <code>mseal</code> code snippet and iteratively sealing pages in select stack frames where untrusted data could reside for exploitation:</p>
<pre>#define SIMPLE_HARDEN_NX_SINGLE_PAGE(frame) \
  <span>do</span> { \
    <span>void</span> *frame_offset = (<span>void</span> *)((int64_t) &amp;frame &amp; ~(getpagesize() - 1)); \
    <span>if</span> (mseal(frame_offset, getpagesize()) == -1) { \
      handle_error("mseal"); \
    } \
  } <span>while</span>(<span>0</span>)

<span>int</span> frame_2(void)
{
    <span>int</span> frame_start = <span>0</span>;
    <span>unsigned char</span> another_untrusted_buffer[<span>1024</span>] = { <span>0</span> };
    SIMPLE_HARDEN_NX_SINGLE_PAGE(frame_start);
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span>;
}

<span>int</span> frame_1(<span>void</span>)
{
    <span>unsigned char</span> untrusted_buffer[<span>1024</span>] = { <span>0</span> };
    SIMPLE_HARDEN_NX_SINGLE_PAGE(untrusted_buffer);
    <span>return</span> frame_2();
}
</pre>
<p>Even if a sealed VMA is reused as a frame for another function with sealing logic, invoking <code>mseal</code> again would be considered a no-op, so no errors would emerge. Of course, developers should be mindful of edge cases like automatic stack expansion from aggressive usage or bespoke features like <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/SplitStacks">stack splitting</a>.</p>
<p>Hopefully, as the integration of <code>mseal</code> into glibc continues, we’ll see tunables emerge that do not require any manual use of the syscall for the stack. Commenters in the LWN mailing list <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/958956/">yearn for an automatic sealing that can be toggled for simpler applications</a>.</p>
<p>And with all this said, if an attacker doesn’t want to fully ROP and insists on bringing back shellcode nostalgia, they could always use their initial code reuse technique to mmap a fresh region that is executable. However, this is pretty laborious, as it now involves copying the exploit payload from a readable region to this new mapping.</p>
<h4>Mitigating unmapping-based, data-only exploitation</h4>
<p>Disallowing <code>mprotect</code> also prevents a sealed region from becoming writable, which is valuable if there are data variables that, when modified, could enhance an exploit primitive. However, during the inception of <code>mseal</code>, Chrome maintainers rationalized an easier and more powerful technique with the added benefit of circumventing CFI (control-flow integrity). They determined that if an attacker can pass a corrupted pointer to unmapping/remapping syscalls, they can “punch a hole” in memory that could be refilled with attacker-controlled data. This would not violate CFI guarantees, as forward- and backward-edge CFI would cover only tampered control-flow transitions (e.g., stack return addresses and function pointers).</p>
<p>This is incredibly enticing for a browser implementing a JIT compiler. V8’s Turbofan can create regions that switch between RW and RX, aiding the refill process and changing permissions. Thus, an attacker can take advantage of the JIT compilation process by emitting executable code from hot-path JavaScript into the unmapped region to overwrite critical data and then leverage modifications to yield code execution.</p>
<p>We argue this is a <em>data-only</em> exploitation technique, as it doesn’t involve directly hijacking control flow or requiring leaked pointers but rather tampering with particular data in memory that influences control flow to the attacker’s liking. In an era of mitigations like CFI, this has emerged as a pretty potent technique during exploitation. Thus, memory sealing can prevent these particular data-only techniques by disallowing hole-punching scenarios.</p>
<p>This particular data-only technique isn’t just for browsers with JIT compilers! A similar technique would be the <a href="https://maxwelldulin.com/BlogPost/House-of-Muney-Heap-Exploitation">House of Muney</a> for userspace heap exploitation. As Max Dulin points out in his post, Qualys used this technique to perform a <a href="https://www.qualys.com/2020/05/19/cve-2005-1513/remote-code-execution-qmail.txt">real-world exploit for an ancient bug in Qmail</a>.</p>
<p>This technique relies on the fact that for huge allocated chunks (greater than the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Malloc-Tunable-Parameters.html"><code>M_MAP_THRESHOLD</code></a> tunable), <code>malloc</code> and <code>free</code> will directly invoke <code>mmap</code> and <code>munmap</code>, respectively, with no intermediate freelists that cache any freed chunks (which helps greatly simplify exploitation). Since size metadata exists at the top of allocated chunks, tampering it to a different page size and freeing it would cause a <code>munmap</code> on memory regions adjacent to the chunk. Dulin used the arbitrary <code>munmap</code> to target the <code>.gnu.hash</code> and <code>.dynsym</code> regions and after refilling them with another larger mmap chunk, enabled the overwriting of a single, yet-to-be-resolved PLT entry, reviving a GOT overwrite-style attack!</p>
<p>Dulin has a very well-done and annotated PoC for this attack <a href="https://github.com/mdulin2/house-of-muney/blob/master/munmap_rewrite.c">here</a>. Here’s an abridged version that goes up to the point where the unmapping and refill occur:</p>
<pre>#<span>include</span> <span>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>
#<span>include</span> <span>&lt;string.h&gt;</span>
#<span>include</span> <span>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</span>
#<span>include</span> <span>&lt;malloc.h&gt;</span>

<span>// With this allocation size,
// malloc is now equivalent to mmap
// free is now equivalent to munmap</span>
#define THRESHOLD_SIZE <span>0x100000</span>

<span>int</span> main() {
    <span>long long</span> *bottom, *top, *refill;

    bottom = malloc(THRESHOLD_SIZE);
    memset(bottom, <span>'B'</span>, THRESHOLD_SIZE);

    <span>// [1] Allocation that we write into out-of-bounds from a prior chunk</span>
    top = malloc(THRESHOLD_SIZE);
    memset(top, <span>'A'</span>, THRESHOLD_SIZE);

    <span>// [2] Corrupts size field, ensuring page alignment + mmap bit is set</span>
    <span>// size to unmap = top + bottom + large arbitrary size</span>
    <span>int</span> unmap_size = (<span>0xfffffffd</span> &amp; top[<span>-1</span>]) + (<span>0xfffffffd</span> &amp; bottom[<span>-1</span>]) + <span>0x14000</span>;
    top[<span>-1</span>] = (unmap_size | <span>2</span>);

    <span>// Trigger munmap with corrupted chunk</span>
    free(top);

    <span>// [3] Refill with new and larger mmap chunk</span>
    refill = malloc(<span>0x5F0000</span>);
    memset(refill, <span>'X'</span>, <span>0x5F0000</span>);
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span>;
}
</pre>
<p>By the time we finish <code>[1]</code>, we can see that the <code>top</code> and <code>bottom</code> chunks now exist in a separate mapping below the heap, separated by 4096-byte padding. Note the adjacent libc mapping at <code>0xfffff7df0000</code>:</p>

<p>At <code>[2]</code>, we corrupt the <code>size</code> field of the chunk to a much larger page size and ensure that the <code>mmap</code> bit is set. When we break on the <code>munmap</code> occurring in the free <code>[3]</code>, the <code>size</code> argument passed has been changed, allowing an unmap into the adjacent region!</p>

<p>This is a pretty nifty data-only technique that can operate even in the presence of CFI and does not require a prerequisite ASLR leak!</p>
<p>Luckily, the aforementioned set of VMAs in <code>mseal</code>’s glibc integration is expected to automatically mitigate this without any developer intervention, as mapped binary code and dynamic libraries become sealed from any remap/unmapping tricks like this. For additional hardening, a developer can selectively seal mmap allocations that they know will never expand or become unmapped during the lifetime of their program. This will have the added benefit of preventing the previous exploit scenario if attacker-controlled data can be expected to be written into the mmap chunks and may become writable/executable.</p>
<h3>Build stronger software with mseal</h3>
<p>There are likely many other use cases and scenarios that we didn’t cover. After all, <code>mseal</code> is the newest kid on the block in the Linux kernel! As the glibc integration completes and matures, we expect to see improved iterations for the syscall to meet particular demands, including fleshing out the ultimate use of the <code>flags</code> parameter.</p>
<p>Hardening software is complex, as navigating and evaluating new security mitigations can be challenging in understanding the risk and reward payoff.

    </div><p>A new study conducted on roundworms finds that a common plastic ingredient causes breaks in DNA strands, resulting in egg cells with the wrong number of chromosomes. Monica Colaiácovo of Harvard Medical School led the study, which was published October 24 in the journal <i>PLOS Genetics</i>.</p>

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                    <p>Benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP) is a chemical that makes plastic more flexible and durable, and is found in many consumer products, including food packaging, personal care products and children's toys. Previous studies have shown that BBP interferes with the body's hormones and affects <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/human+reproduction/" rel="tag">human reproduction</a> and development, but the details of how it impacts reproduction have been unclear.</p>
<p>In the new study, researchers tested a range of doses of BBP on the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and looked for abnormal changes in egg cells. They saw that at levels similar to those detected in humans, BBP interferes with how newly copied chromosomes are distributed into the sex cells. Specifically, BBP causes oxidative stress and breaks in the DNA strands, which lead to <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cell+death/" rel="tag">cell death</a> and egg cells with the wrong number of chromosomes.</p>
<p>Based on these findings, the researchers propose that BBP exposure alters <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/gene+expression/" rel="tag">gene expression</a> in ways that cause significant damage to the DNA, ultimately leading to lower quality egg cells with abnormal chromosomes. The study also showed that C. elegans metabolizes BBP in the same way as mammals, and is impacted at similar BBP levels that occur in humans, suggesting that C. elegans is an effective model for studying the impacts on people. Overall, the study underscores the toxic nature of this very common plastic ingredient and the damage it causes to animal reproduction.</p>
<p>The authors summarize, "Here, examining the female germline in the nematode C. elegans, this study found that a level of exposure within the range detected in human serum and urine, alters gene expression linking increased germline <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/oxidative+stress/" rel="tag">oxidative stress</a> with compromised genomic integrity and errors in meiotic chromosome segregation."</p>

        <!--<h1>Logic</h1> -->

        

        

<p>Now let’s talk about one more <em>seemingly</em> unrelated topic just so we can “surprise” ourselves when we realize it’s category theory. By the way, in this chapter there will be another surprise in addition to that, so don’t fall asleep.</p>

<p>Also, I will not merely transport you to a different branch of mathematics, but to an entirely different discipline - <em>logic</em>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-logic">What is logic</h2>

<p>Logic is the science of the <em>possible</em>. As such, it is at the root of all other sciences, all of which are sciences of the <em>actual</em>, i.e. that which really exists. For example, if science explains how our universe works then logic is the part of the description which is also applicable to any other universe that is <em>possible to exist</em>. A scientific theory aims to be consistent with both itself and observations, while a logical theory only needs to be consistent with itself.</p>

<p>Logic studies the <em>rules</em> by which knowing one thing leads you to conclude (or <em>prove</em>) that some other thing is also true, regardless of the things’ domain (e.g. scientific discipline) and by only referring to their form.</p>

<p>On top of that, it (logic) tries to organize those rules in <em>logical systems</em> (or <em>formal systems</em> as they are also called).</p>

<h2 id="logic-and-mathematics">Logic and mathematics</h2>

<p>Seeing this description, we might think that the subject of logic is quite similar to the subject of set theory and category theory, as we described it in the first chapter - instead of the word “formal” we used another similar word, namely “abstract”, and instead of “logical system” we said “theory”. This observation would be quite correct - today most people agree that every mathematical theory is actually logic plus some additional definitions added to it. For example, part of the reason why <em>set theory</em> is so popular as a theory for the foundations of mathematics is that it can be defined by adding just one single primitive to the standard axioms of logic which we will see shortly - the binary relation that indicates <em>set membership</em>. Category theory is close to logic too, but in a quite different way.</p>

<h2 id="primary-propositions">Primary propositions</h2>

<p>A consequence of logic being the science of the possible is that in order to do anything at all in it, we should have an initial set of propositions that we accept as true or false. These are also called “premises”, “primary propositions” or “atomic propositions” as Wittgenstein dubbed them.</p>

<p><img src="https://abuseofnotation.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/05_logic/balls.svg" alt="Balls"></p>

<p>In the context of logic itself, these propositions are abstracted away (i.e. we are not concerned about them directly) and so they can be represented with the colorful balls that you are familiar with.</p>

<h2 id="composing-propositions">Composing propositions</h2>

<p>At the heart of logic, as in category theory, is the concept of <em>composition</em> - if we have two or more propositions that are somehow related to one another, we can combine them into one using a logical operators, like “and”, “or” “follows” etc. The results would be new propositions, which we might call <em>composite propositions</em> to emphasize the fact that they are not primary.</p>

<p>This composition resembles the way in which two monoid objects are combined into one using the monoid operation. Actually, some logical operations do form monoids, like for example the operation <em>and</em>, with the proposition $true$ serving as the identity element.</p>

<p><img src="https://abuseofnotation.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/05_logic/logic_monoid.svg" alt="Logical operations that form monoids"></p>

<p>However, unlike monoids/groups, logics study combinations not just with one but with <em>many</em> logical operations and <em>the ways in which they relate to one another</em>, for example, in logic we might be interested in the law of distributivity of <em>and</em> and $or$ operations and what it entails.</p>

<p><img src="https://abuseofnotation.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/05_logic/logic_distributivity.svg" alt="The distributivity operation of &quot;and&quot; and &quot;or&quot;"></p>

<p>Important to note that $∧$ is the symbol for <em>and</em> and $∨$ is the symbol for $or$ (although the law above is actually valid even if <em>and</em> and $or$ are flipped).</p>

<h2 id="the-equivalence-of-primary-and-composite-propositions">The equivalence of primary and composite propositions</h2>

<p>When looking at the last diagram, it is important to emphasize that,  propositions that are composed of several premises (symbolized by gray balls, containing some other balls) are not in any way different from “primary” propositions (single-color balls) and that they compose in the same way (although in the leftmost proposition the green ball is wrapped in a gray ball to make the diagram prettier).</p>

<p><img src="https://abuseofnotation.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/05_logic/balls_propositions.svg" alt="Balls as propositions"></p>

<h2 id="modus-ponens">Modus ponens</h2>

<p>As an example of a proposition that contains multiple levels of nesting (and also as a great introduction of the subject of logic in its own right), consider one of the oldest (it was already known by Stoics at 3rd century B.C.) and most famous propositions ever, namely the <em>modus ponens</em>.</p>

<p>Modus ponens is a proposition that is composed of two other propositions (which here we denote $A$ and $B$) and it states that if proposition $A$ is true and also if proposition $(A → B)$ is true (that is if $A$ implies $B$), then $B$ is true as well. For example, if we know that “Socrates is a human” and that “humans are mortal” (or “being human implies being mortal”), we also know that “Socrates is mortal.”</p>

<p><img src="https://abuseofnotation.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/05_logic/modus_ponens.svg" alt="Modus ponens"></p>

<p>Let’s dive into this proposition. We can see that it is composed of two other propositions in a $follows$ relation, where the proposition that follows ($B$) is primary, but the proposition from which $B$ follows is not primary (let’s call that one $C$ - so the whole proposition becomes $C → B$.)</p>

<p>Going one more level down, we notice that the $C$ propositions is itself composed of two propositions in an <em>and</em>, relationship - $A$ and let’s call the other one $D$ (so $A ∧ D$), where $D$ is itself composed of two propositions, this time in a $follows$ relationship - $A → B$. But all of this is better visualized in the diagram.</p>

<h2 id="tautologies">Tautologies</h2>

<p>We often cannot tell whether a given composite proposition is true or false without knowing the values of the propositions that it is made of. However, with propositions such as <em>modus ponens</em> we can: modus ponens is <em>always true</em>, regardless of whether the propositions that form it are true or false. If we want to be fancy, we can also say that it is <em>true in all models of the logical system</em>, a model being a set of real-world premises are taken to be signified by our propositions.</p>

<p>For example, our previous example will not stop being true if we <em>substitute</em> “Socrates” with any other name, nor if we substitute “mortal” for any other quality that humans possess.</p>

<p><img src="https://abuseofnotation.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/05_logic/modus_ponens_variations.svg" alt="Variation of modus ponens"></p>

<p>Propositions that are always true are called <em>tautologies</em>. And their more-famous counterparts that are always false are called <em>contradictions</em>. You can turn each tautology into contradiction or the other way around by adding a “not”.</p>

<p>The simplest tautology is the so called law of identity, the statement that each proposition implies itself (e.g. “All bachelors are unmarried”). It may remind you of something.</p>

<p><img src="https://abuseofnotation.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/05_logic/tautology_identity.svg" alt="Identity tautology"></p>

<p>Here are some more complex (less boring) tautologies (the symbol $¬$ means “not”/negation.</p>

<p><img src="https://abuseofnotation.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/05_logic/tautology_list.svg" alt="Tautologies"></p>

<p>We will learn how to determine which propositions are a tautologies shortly, but first let’s see why is this important at all i.e. what are tautologies good for.</p>

<h2 id="axiom-schemasrules-of-inference">Axiom schemas/Rules of inference</h2>

<p>Tautologies are useful because they are the basis of <em>axiom schemas</em>/<em>rules of inference</em>. And <em>axiom schemas</em> or <em>rules of inference</em> serve as starting point from which we can generate other true logical statements by means of substitution.</p>

<p>Realizing that the colors of the balls in modus ponens are superficial, we may want to represent the general structure of modus ponens that all of its variations share.</p>

<p><img src="https://abuseofnotation.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/05_logic/modus_ponens_schema.svg" alt="Modus ponens"></p>

<p>This structure (the one that looks like a coloring book in our example) is called <em>axiom schema</em>. And the propositions that are produced by it are <em>axioms</em>.</p>

<p>Note that the propositions that we plug into the schema don’t have to be primary. For example, having the proposition $a$ (that is symbolized below by the orange ball) and the proposition stating that $a$ implies $a \lor b$ (which is one of the tautologies that we saw above), we can plug those propositions into the <em>modus ponens</em> and prove that $a \lor b$ is true.</p>

<p><img src="https://abuseofnotation.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/05_logic/modus_ponens_composite.svg" alt="Using modus ponens for rule of inference"></p>

<p><em>Axiom schemas</em> and <em>rules of inference</em> are almost the same thing except that rules of inference allow us to actually distill the conclusion from the premises. For example in the case above, we can use modus ponens as a rule of inference to proves that $a \lor b$ is true.</p>

<p>All axiom schemas can be easily applied as rules of inference and the other way around.</p>

<h2 id="logical-systems">Logical systems</h2>

<p>Knowing that we can use axiom schemas/rules of inference to generate new propositions, we might ask whether it is possible to create a small collection of such schemas/rules that is curated in such a way that it enables us to generate <em>all</em> other propositions. You would be happy (although a little annoyed, I imagine) to learn that there exist not only one, but many such collections. And yes, collections of this sort are what we call <em>logical systems</em>.</p>

<p>Here is one such collection which consists of the following five axiom schemes <em>in addition to the inference rule modus ponens</em> (These are axiom schemes, even though we use colors).</p>

<p><img src="https://abuseofnotation.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/05_logic/min_hilbert.svg" alt="A minimal collection of Hilbert axioms"></p>

<p>Proving that this and other similar logical systems are complete (can really generate all other propositions) is due to Gödel and is known as “Gödel’s completeness theorem” (Gödel is so important that I specifically searched for the “ö” letter so I can spell his hame right.)</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>We now have an idea about how do some of the main logical constructs (axioms, rules of inference) work. But in order to prove that they are true, and to understand <em>what they are</em>, we need to do so through a specific <em>interpretation</em> of those constructs.</p>

<p>We will look into two interpretations - one very old and the other, relatively recent. This would be a slight detour from our usual subject matter of points and arrows, but I assure you that it would be worth it. So let’s start.</p>

<h2 id="classical-logic-the-truth-functional-interpretation">Classical logic. The truth-functional interpretation</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Beyond the world that we inhabit and perceive every day, there exist the <em>world of forms</em> where reside all ideas and concepts that manifest themselves in the objects that we perceive e.g. beyond all the people that have ever lived, there lies the prototypical person, and we are people only insofar as we resemble that person, beyond all the things in the world that are strong, lies the ultimate concepts of strength, from which all of them borrow etc. And although, as mere mortals, we live in the world of appearances and cannot perceive the world of forms, we can, through philosophy, “recollect” with it and know some of its features.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The above is a summary of a worldview that is due to the Greek philosopher Plato and is sometimes called Plato’s <em>theory of forms</em>. Originally, the discipline of logic represents an effort to think and structure our thoughts in a way that they apply to this world of forms i.e. in a “formal” way. Today, this original paradigm of logic is known as “classical logic”. Although it all started with Plato, most of it is due to the 20th century mathematician David Hilbert.</p>

<p>The existence of the world of forms implies that, even if there are many things that we, people, don’t know and would not ever know, at least <em>somewhere out there</em> there exists an answer to every question. In logic, this translates to <em>the principle of bivalence</em> that states that <em>each proposition is either true or false</em>. And, due to this principle, propositions in classical logic can be aptly represented in set theory by the boolean set, which contains those two values.</p>

<p><img src="https://abuseofnotation.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/05_logic/boolean_set.svg" alt="The set of boolean values"></p>

<p>According to the classical interpretation, you can think of <em>primary propositions</em> as just a bunch of boolean values. <em>Logical operators</em> are functions that take a one or several boolean values and return another boolean value (and <em>composite propositions</em> are, just the results of the application of these functions).</p>

<p>Let’s review all logical operators in this semantic context.</p>

<h2 id="the-negation-operation">The <em>negation</em> operation</h2>

<p>Let’s begin with the negation operation. Negation is a unary operation, which means that it is a function that takes just <em>one</em> argument and (like all other logical operators) returns one value, where both the arguments and the return type are boolean values.</p>

<p><img src="https://abuseofnotation.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/05_logic/negation.svg" alt="negation"></p>

<p>The same function can also be expressed in a slightly less-fancy way by this table.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>p</th>
      <th>¬p</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>True</td>
      <td>False</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>False</td>
      <td>True</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Tables like this one are called <em>truth tables</em> and they are ubiquitous in classical logic. They can be used not only for defining operators but for proving results as well.</p>

<h2 id="interlude-proving-results-by-truth-tables">Interlude: Proving results by truth tables</h2>

<p>Having defined the negation operator, we are in position to prove the first of the axioms of the logical system we saw, namely the <em>double negation elimination</em>. In natural language, this axiom is equivalent to the observation that saying “I am <em>not unable</em> to do X” is the same as saying  “I am <em>able</em> to do it”.</p>

<p><img src="https://abuseofnotation.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/05_logic/double_negation_formula.svg" alt="Double negation elimination formula"></p>

<p>(despite its triviality, the double negation axiom is probably the most controversial result in logic, we will see why later.)</p>

<p>If we view logical operators as functions from and to the set of boolean values, than proving axioms involves composing several of those functions into one function and observing its output. More specifically, the proof of the formula above involves just composing the negation function with itself and verifying that it leaves us in the same place from which we started.</p>

<p><img src="https://abuseofnotation.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/05_logic/double_negation_proof.svg" alt="Double negation elimination"></p>

<p>If we want to be formal about it, we might say that applying negation two times is equivalent to applying the <em>identity</em> function.</p>

<p><img src="https://abuseofnotation.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/05_logic/boolean_identity.svg" alt="The identity function for boolean values"></p>

<p>If we are tired of diagrams, we can represent the composition diagram above as table as well.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>p</th>
      <th>¬p</th>
      <th>¬¬p</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>True</td>
      <td>False</td>
      <td>True</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>False</td>
      <td>True</td>
      <td>False</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Each proposition in classical logic can be proved with such diagrams/tables.</p>

<h2 id="the-and-and-or-operations">The <em>and</em> and <em>or</em> operations</h2>

<p>OK, <em>you</em> know what <em>and</em> means and <em>I</em> know what it means, but what about those annoying people that want everything to be formally specified (nudge, nudge). Well we already know how we can satisfy them - we just have to construct the boolean function that represents <em>and</em>.</p>

<p>Because <em>and</em> is a <em>binary</em> operator, instead of a single value the function would accept a <em>pair</em> of boolean values.</p>

<p><img src="https://abuseofnotation.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/05_logic/and.svg" alt="And"></p>

<p>Here is the equivalent truth-table (in which $∧$ is the symbol for <em>and</em>.)</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>p</th>
      <th>q</th>
      <th>p ∧ q</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>True</td>
      <td>True</td>
      <td>True</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>True</td>
      <td>False</td>
      <td>False</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>False</td>
      <td>True</td>
      <td>False</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>False</td>
      <td>False</td>
      <td>False</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>We can do the same for $or$, here is the table.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>p</th>
      <th>q</th>
      <th>p ∨ q</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>True</td>
      <td>True</td>
      <td>True</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>True</td>
      <td>False</td>
      <td>True</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>False</td>
      <td>True</td>
      <td>True</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>False</td>
      <td>False</td>
      <td>False</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Task:</strong> Draw the diagram for <em>or</em>.</p>

<p>Using those tables, we can also prove some axiom schemas we can use later:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For <em>and</em> $p ∧ q → p$ and $p ∧ q → q$ “If I am tired and hungry, this means that I am hungry”.</li>
  <li>For <em>or</em>:  $p → p ∨ q$ and $q → p ∨ q$ “If I have a pen this means that I am either have a pen or a ruler”.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-implies-operation">The <em>implies</em> operation</h2>

<p>Let’s now look into something less trivial: the <em>implies</em> operation, (also known as <em>material condition</em>). This operation binds two propositions in a way that the truth of the first one implies the truth of the second one (or that the first proposition is a <em>necessary condition</em> for the second.) You can read $p → q$ as “if $p$ is true, then $q$ must also be true.</p>

<p>Implies is also a binary function - it is represented by a function from an ordered pair of boolean values, to a boolean value.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>p</th>
      <th>q</th>
      <th>p → q</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>True</td>
      <td>True</td>
      <td>True</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>True</td>
      <td>False</td>
      <td>False</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>False</td>
      <td>True</td>
      <td>True</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>False</td>
      <td>False</td>
      <td>True</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Now there are some aspects of this which are non-obvious so let’s go through every case.</p>

<ol>
  <li>If $p$ is true and $q$ is also true, then $p$ does imply $q$ - obviously.</li>
  <li>If $p$ is true but $q$ is false then $q$ does not follow from $p$ - cause $q$ would have been true if it did.</li>
  <li>If $p$ is false but $q$ is true, then $p$ still does imply $q$. What the hell? Consider that by saying that $p$ implies $q$ we don’t say that the two are 100% interdependent e.g. the claim that “drinking alcohol causes headache” does not mean that drinking is the only source of headaches.</li>
  <li>And finally if $p$ is false but $q$ is false too, then $p$ still does imply $q$ (just some other day).</li>
</ol>

<p>It might help you to remember that in classical logic $p → q$ ($p$ implies $q$) is true when $\neg p ∨ q$ (either $p$ is false or $q$ is true.)</p>

<h2 id="the-if-and-only-if-operation">The <em>if and only if</em> operation</h2>

<p>Now, let’s review the operation that indicates that two propositions are equivalent (or, when one proposition is <em>a necessary and sufficient condition</em> for the other (which implies that the reverse is also true.)) This operation yields true when the propositions have the same value.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>p</th>
      <th>q</th>
      <th>p ↔ q</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>True</td>
      <td>True</td>
      <td>True</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>True</td>
      <td>False</td>
      <td>False</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>False</td>
      <td>True</td>
      <td>False</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>False</td>
      <td>False</td>
      <td>True</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>But what’s more interesting about this operation is that it can be constructed using the <em>implies</em> operation - it is equivalent to each of the propositions implying the other one (so $p \leftrightarrow q$ is the same as $p \to q \land q \to p$) - something which we can easily prove by comparing some truth tables.</p>

  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>p</th>

<p>Let’s examine the above formula, stating that $p → q$ is the same as $¬p ∨ q$.</p>

<p><img src="https://abuseofnotation.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/05_logic/hilbert_formula.svg" alt="Hilbert formula"></p>

<p>We can easily prove this by using truth tables.</p>

<p>But it would be much more intuitive if we do it using axioms and rules of inference. To do so, we start with the formula we have ($p → q$) plus the axiom schemas, and arrive at the formula we want to prove ($¬p ∨ q$).</p>

<p>Here is one way to do it. The formulas that are used at each step are specified at the right-hand side, the rule of inference is modus ponens.</p>

<p><img src="https://abuseofnotation.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/05_logic/hilbert_proof.svg" alt="Hilbert proof"></p>

<p>Note that to really prove that the two formulas are equivalent we have to also do it the other way around (start with ($¬p ∨ q$) and ($p → q$)).</p>

<h2 id="intuitionistic-logic-the-bhk-interpretation">Intuitionistic logic. The BHK interpretation</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>[…] logic is life in the human brain; it may accompany life outside the brain but it can never guide it by virtue of its own power. — L.E.J. Brouwer</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t know about you, but I feel that the classical truth-functional interpretation of logic (althought it works and is correct in its own right) doesn’t fit well the categorical framework that we are using here: It is too “low-level”, it relies on manipulating the values of the propositions. According to it, the operations <em>and</em> and <em>or</em> are just 2 of the 16 possible binary logical operations and they are not really connected to each other (but we know that they actually are.)</p>

<p>For these and other reasons, in the 20th century a whole new school of logic was founded, called <em>intuitionistic logic</em>. If we view classical logic as based on <em>set theory</em>, then intuitionistic logic would be based on <em>category theory</em> and its related theories. If <em>classical logic</em> is based on Plato’s theory of forms, then intuitionism began with a philosophical idea originating from Kant and Schopenhauer: the idea that the world as we experience it is largely predetermined of out perceptions of it. Thus without absolute standards for truth, a proof of a proposition becomes something that you <em>construct</em>, rather than something you discover.</p>

<p>Classical and intuitionistic logic diverge from one another right from the start: because according to intuitionistic logic we are <em>constructing</em> proofs rather than <em>discovering</em> them as some universal truth, we are <em>off with the principle of bivalence</em>. That is, in intuitionistic logic we have no basis to claim that each statements is necessarily <em>true or false</em>. For example, there might be a statements that might not be provable not because they are false, but simply because they fall outside of the domain of a given logical system (the twin-prime conjecture is often given as an example for this.)</p>

<p>Anyway, intuitionistic logic is not bivalent, i.e. we cannot have all propositions reduced to true and false.</p>

<p><img src="https://abuseofnotation.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/05_logic/true_false.svg" alt="The True/False dichotomy"></p>

<p>One thing that we still do have there are propositions that are “true” in the sense that a proof for them is given - the primary propositions. So with some caveats (which we will see later) the bivalence between true and false proposition might be thought out as similar to the bivalence between the existence or absense of a proof for a given proposition - there either is a proof of it or there isn’t.</p>

<p><img src="https://abuseofnotation.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/05_logic/proved_unproved.svg" alt="The proved/unproved dichotomy"></p>

<p>This bivalence is at the heart of what is called the Brouwer–Heyting–Kolmogorov (BHK) interpretation of logic, something that we will look into next.</p>

<p>The original formulation of the BHK interpretation is not based on any particular mathematical theory. Here, we will first illustrate it using the language of set theory (just so we can abandon it a little later).</p>

<h2 id="the-and-and-or-operations-1">The <em>and</em> and <em>or</em> operations</h2>

<p>As the existence of a proof of a proposition is taken to mean that the proposition is true, the definitions of <em>and</em> is rather simple - the proof of $A ∧ B$ is just <em>a pair</em> containing a proof of $A$, and a proof of $B$ i.e. <em>a set-theoretic product</em> of the two (see chapter 2). The principle for determining whether the proposition is true or false is similar to that of primary propositions - if the pair of proofs of $A$ and  $B$ exist (i.e. if both proofs exist) then the proof of $A \land B$ can be constructed (and so $A \land B$ is “true”).</p>

<p><img src="https://abuseofnotation.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/05_logic/bhk_and.svg" alt="And in the BHK interpretation"></p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> what would be the <strong>or</strong> operation in this case?</p>

<h2 id="the-implies-operation-1">The <em>implies</em> operation</h2>

<p>Now for the punchline: in the BHK interpretation, the <em>implies</em> operation is just a <em>function</em> between proofs. Saying that $A$ implies $B$ ($A \to B$) would just mean that there exist a function which can convert a proof of $A$ to a proof of $B$.</p>

<p><img src="https://abuseofnotation.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/05_logic/bhk_implies.svg" alt="Implies in the BHK interpretation"></p>

<p>And, (it gets even more interesting) the <em>modus ponens</em> rule of inference is nothing more than the process of <em>functional application</em>. i.e. if we have a proof of $A$ and a function $A \to B$ we can call this function to obtain a proof of $B$.</p>

<p>(In order to define this formally, we also need to define functions in terms of sets i.e. we need to have a set representing $A \to B$ for each $A$ and $B$. We will come back to this later.)</p>

<h2 id="the-if-and-only-if-operation-1">The <em>if and only if</em> operation</h2>

<p>In the section on classical logic, we proved that two propositions $A$ and $B$ are equivalent if $A$ implies $B$ and $B$ implies $A$. But if the <em>implies</em> operation is just a function, then proposition are equivalent precisely when there are two functions, converting each of them to the other i.e. when the sets containing the propositions are <em>isomorphic</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://abuseofnotation.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/05_logic/bhk_iff.svg" alt="Implies in the BHK interpretation"></p>

<p>(Perhaps we should note that <em>not all set-theoretic functions are proofs</em>, only a designated set of them (which we call <em>canonical</em> functions) i.e. in set theory you can construct functions and isomorphisms between any pair of singleton sets, but that won’t mean that all proofs are equivalent.)</p>

<h2 id="the-negation-operation-1">The <em>negation</em> operation</h2>

<p>So according to BHK interpretation saying that $A$ is true, means that that we possess a proof of $A$ - simple enough. But it’s a bit harder to express the fact that $A$ is false: it is not enough to say that we <em>don’t have a proof</em> of $A$ (the fact that don’t have it, doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist). Instead, we must show that claiming that $A$ is true leads to a <em>contradiction</em>.</p>

<p>To express this, intuitionistic logic defines the constant $⊥$ which plays the role of <em>False</em> (also known as the “bottom value”). $⊥$ is defined as the proof of a formula that does not have any proofs. And the equivalent of false propositions are the ones that imply that the bottom value is provable (which is a contradiction). So $¬A$ is $A \to ⊥$.</p>

<p>In set theory, the $⊥$ constant is expressed by the empty set.</p>

<p><img src="https://abuseofnotation.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/05_logic/bhk_false.svg" alt="False in the BHK interpretation"></p>

<p>And the observation that propositions that are connected to the bottom value are false is expressed by the fact that if a proposition is true, i.e. there exists a proof of it, then there can be no function from it to the empty set.</p>

<p><img src="https://abuseofnotation.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/05_logic/bhk_false_function.svg" alt="False in the BHK interpretation"></p>

<p>The only way for there to be such function is if the set of proofs of the proposition is empty as well.</p>

<p><img src="https://abuseofnotation.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/05_logic/bhk_false_function_2.svg" alt="False in the BHK interpretation"></p>

<p><strong>Task:</strong> Look up the definition of function and verify that there cannot exist a function from any set <em>to the empty set</em></p>

<p><strong>Task</strong> Look up the definition of function and verify that there does exist a function <em>from the empty set</em> to itself (in fact there exist a function from the empty set to any other set.</p>

<h2 id="the-law-of-excluded-middle">The law of excluded middle</h2>

<p>Although intuitionistic logic differs a lot from classical logic when it comes to its <em>semantics</em>, i.e. in the way the whole system is built (which we described above), it actually doesn’t differ so much in terms of <em>syntax</em>, i.e. if we try to deduce the axiom schemas/rules of inference that correspond to the definitions of the structures outlined above, we would see that they are virtually the same as the ones that define classical logic. There is, however, one exception concerning the <em>double negation elimination axiom</em> that we saw earlier, a version of which is known as <em>the law of excluded middle</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://abuseofnotation.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/05_logic/excluded_middle_formula.svg" alt="The formula of the principle of the excluded middle"></p>

<p>This law is valid in classical logic and is true when we look at its truth tables, but there is no justification for it terms of the BHK interpretation. Why? in intuitionistic logic saying that something is false amounts to <em>constructing a proof</em> that it is false (that it implies the bottom value) and there is no method/function/alghorithm that can either prove that a given proposition is either true and false.</p>

<p>The question of whether you can use the law of excluded middle spawned a heated debate between the classical logic proponent David Hilbert and the intuitionistic logic proponent L.E.J. Brouwer, known as <em>the Brouwer–Hilbert controversy</em>.</p>

<h2 id="logics-as-categories">Logics as categories</h2>

<p>Leaving the differences between intuitionistic and classical logics aside, the BHK interpretation is interesting because it provides that higher-level view of logic, that we need in order to construct a interpretation of it based on category theory.</p>

<p>Such higher-level interpretations of logic are sometimes called <em>algebraic</em> interpretations, <em>algebraic</em> being an umbrella term describing all structures that can be represented using category theory, like groups and orders.</p>

<h2 id="the-curry-howard-isomorphism">The Curry-Howard isomorphism</h2>

<p>Programmers might find the definition of the BHK interpretation interesting for other reason - it is very similar to a definition of a programming language: propositions are <em>types</em>, the <em>implies</em> operations are <em>functions</em>, <em>and</em> operations are composite types (objects), and <em>or</em> operations are <em>sum types</em> (which are currently not supported in most programming languages, but that’s a separate topic). Finally a proof of a given proposition is represented by a value of the corresponding type. 
<img src="https://abuseofnotation.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/05_logic/logic_curry.svg" alt="Logic as a programming language"></p>

<p>This similarity is known as the <em>Curry-Howard isomorphism</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Task:</strong> The Curry-Howard isomorphism is also the basis of special types of programming languages called “proof assistants” which help you verify logical proofs. Install a proof assistant and try to see how it works (I recommend the Coq Tutorial by Mike Nahas).</p>

<h2 id="cartesian-closed-categories">Cartesian closed categories</h2>

<p>Knowing about the Curry-Howard isomorphism and knowing also that programming languages can be described by category theory may lead us to think that <em>category theory is part of this isomorphism as well</em>. And we would be quite correct — this is why it is sometimes known as the Curry-Howard-<em>Lambek</em> isomorphism (Joachim Lambek being the person who formulated the categorical side). So let’s examine this isomorphism. As all other isomorphisms, it comes in two parts:</p>

<p>The first part is finding a way to convert a <em>logical system</em> into a category - this would not be hard for us, as sets form a category and the flavor of the BHK interpretation that we saw is based on sets.</p>

<p><img src="https://abuseofnotation.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/05_logic/category_curry_logic.svg" alt="Logic as a category"></p>

<p><strong>Task:</strong> See whether you can prove that logic propositions and the “implies” relation form a category. What is missing?</p>

<p>The second part involves converting a category into a logical system - this is much harder. To do it, we have to enumerate the criteria that a given category has to adhere to, in order for it to be “logical”. These criteria have to guarantee that the category has objects that correspond to all valid logical propositions and no objects that correspond to invalid ones.</p>

<p><img src="https://abuseofnotation.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/05_logic/logic_curry_category.svg" alt="Logic as a category"></p>

<p>Categories that adhere to these criteria are called <em>cartesian closed categories</em>. To describe them here directly, but instead we would start with a similar but simpler structures that we already examined - orders.</p>

<h2 id="logics-as-orders">Logics as orders</h2>

<p>So, we already saw that a logical system along with a set of primary propositions forms a category.</p>

<p><img src="https://abuseofnotation.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/05_logic/logic_category.svg" alt="Logic as a preorder"></p>

<p>If we assume that there is only one way to go from proposition $A$, to proposition $B$ (or there are many ways, but we are not interested in the difference between them), then logic is not only a category, but a <em>preorder</em> in which the relationship “bigger than” is taken to mean “implies”, so ($A \to B$ is $A &gt; B$).</p>

<p><img src="https://abuseofnotation.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/05_logic/logic_preorder.svg" alt="Logic as a preorder"></p>

<p>Furthermore, if we count propositions that follow from each other (or sets of propositions that are proven by the same proof) as equivalent, then logic is a proper <em>partial order</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://abuseofnotation.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/05_logic/logic_order.svg" alt="Logic as an order"></p>

<p>And so it can be represented by a Hasse diagram, in which $A \to B$ only if $A$ is below $B$ in the diagram.</p>

<p><img src="https://abuseofnotation.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/05_logic/logic_hasse.svg" alt="Logic as an order"></p>

<p>This is something quite characteristic of category theory — examining a concept in a more limited version of a category (in this case orders), in order to make things simpler for ourselves.</p>

<p>Now let’s examine the question that we asked before - exactly which <del>categories</del> orders represent logic and what laws does an order have to obey so it is isomorphic to a logical system? We will attempt to answer this question as we examine the elements of logic again, this time in the context of orders.</p>

<h2 id="the-and-and-or-operations-2">The and and or operations</h2>

<p>By now you probably realized that the <em>and</em> and <em>or</em> operations are the bread and butter of logic (although it’s not clear which is which). As we saw, in the BHK interpretation those are represented by set <em>products</em> and <em>sums</em>. The equivalent constructs in the realm of order theory are <em>meets</em> and <em>joins</em> (in category-theoretic terms <em>products</em> and <em>coproducts</em>.)</p>

<p><img src="https://abuseofnotation.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/05_logic/lattice_meet_join.svg" alt="Order meet and joing"></p>

<p>Logic allows you to combine any two propositions in and <em>and</em> or <em>or</em> relationship, so, in order for an order to be “logical” (to be a correct representation for a logical system,) <em>it has to have $meet$ and $join$ operations for all elements</em>. Incidentally we already know how such orders are called - they are called <em>lattices</em>.</p>

<p>And there is one important law of the  <em>and</em> and <em>or</em> operations, that is not always present in all lattices. It concerns the connection between the two, i.e. way that they distribute, over one another.</p>

<p><img src="https://abuseofnotation.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/05_logic/logic_distributivity.svg" alt="The distributivity operation of &quot;and&quot; and &quot;or&quot;"></p>

<p>Lattices that obey this law are called <em>distributive lattices</em>.</p>

<p>Wait, where have we heard about distributive lattices before? In the previous chapter we said that they are isomorphic to <em>inclusion orders</em> i.e. orders of sets, that contain a given collection of elements, and that contain <em>all combinations</em> of a given set of elements. The fact that they popped up again is not coincidental — “logical” orders are isomorphic to inclusion orders. To understand why, you only need to think about the BHK interpretation — the elements which participate in the inclusion are our prime propositions. And the inclusions are all combinations of these elements, in an <em>or</em> relationship (for simplicity’s sake, we are ignoring the <em>and</em> operation.)</p>

<p><img src="https://abuseofnotation.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/05_logic/logic_poset_inclusion.svg" alt="A color mixing poset, ordered by inclusion"></p>

<p>The <em>or</em> and <em>and</em> operations (or, more generally, the <em>coproduct</em> and the <em>product</em>) are, of course, categorically dual, which would explain why the symbols that represent them $\lor$ and $\land$ are the one and the same symbol, but flipped vertically.</p>

<p>And even the symbol itself looks like a representation of the way the arrows converge. This is probably not the case, as this symbol is used way before Hasse diagrams were a thing — for all we know the $\lor$ symbol is probably symbolizes the “u” in “uel” (the latin word for “or”) and the <em>and</em> symbol is just a flipped “u”) — but I still find the similarity fascinating.</p>

<h2 id="the-negation-operation-2">The <em>negation</em> operation</h2>

<p>In order for a distributive lattice to represent a logical system, it has to also have objects that correspond to the values <em>True</em> and <em>False</em> (which are written $\top$ and $\bot$). But, to mandate that these objects exist, we must first find a way to specify what they are in order/category-theoretic terms.</p>

<p>A well-known result in logic, called <em>the principle of explosion</em>, states that if we have a proof of <em>False</em> (which we write as $\bot$) i.e. if we have a statement “<em>False</em> is true” if we use the terminology of classical logic, then any and every other statement can be proven. And we also know that no true statement implies <em>False</em> (in fact in intuitionistic logic this is the definition of a true statement). Based on these criteria we know that the <em>False</em> object would look like this when compared to other objects:</p>

<p><img src="https://abuseofnotation.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/05_logic/lattice_false.svg" alt="False, represented as a Hasse diagram"></p>

<p>Circling back to the BHK interpretation, we see that the empty set fits both of these conditions.</p>

<p><img src="https://abuseofnotation.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/05_logic/lattice_false_bhk.svg" alt="False, represented as a Hasse diagram"></p>

<p>Conversely, the proof of <em>True</em> which we write as $\top$, expressing the statement that “<em>True</em> is true”, is trivial and doesn’t say anything, so <em>nothing follows from it</em>, but at the same time it follows from every other statement.</p>

<p><img src="https://abuseofnotation.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/05_logic/lattice_true.svg" alt="True, represented as a Hasse diagram"></p>

<p>So <em>True</em> and <em>False</em> are just the <em>greatest</em> and <em>least</em> objects of our order (in category-theoretic terms <em>terminal</em> and <em>initial</em> object.)</p>

<p><img src="https://abuseofnotation.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/05_logic/lattice_true_false.svg" alt="The whole logical system, represented as a Hasse diagram"></p>

<p>This is another example of the categorical concept of duality - $\top$ and $\bot$ are dual to each other, which makes a lot of sense if you think about it, and also helps us remember their symbols (althought if you are like me, you’ll spent a year before you stop wondering which one is which, every time I see them).</p>

<p>So in order to represent logic, our distributive lattice has to also be <em>bounded</em> i.e. it has to have greatest and least elements (which play the roles of <em>True</em> and <em>False</em>).</p>

<h2 id="the-implies-operation-2">The <em>implies</em> operation</h2>

<p>As we said, every lattice has representations of propositions implying one another (i.e. it has arrows), but to really represents a logical system it also has to have <em>function objects</em> i.e. there needs to be a rule that identifies a unique object $A → B$ for each pair of objects $A$ and $B$, such that all axioms of logic are followed.</p>

<p><img src="https://abuseofnotation.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/05_logic/implies.svg" alt="Implies operation"></p>

<p>We will describe this object in the same way we described all other operations — by defining a structure consisting of a of objects and arrows in which $A → B$ plays a part. And this structure is actually a categorical reincarnation our favorite rule of inference, the <em>modus ponens</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://abuseofnotation.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/05_logic/implies_modus_ponens.svg" alt="Implies operation"></p>

<p>Modus ponens is the essence of the <em>implies</em> operation, and, because we already know how the operations that it contains (<em>and</em> and <em>implies</em>) are represented in our lattice, we can directly use it as a definition by saying that the object $A → B$ is the one for which modus ponens rule holds.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The function object $A → B$ is an object which is related to objects $A$ and $B$ in such a way that such that $A ∧ (A → B) → B$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This definition is not complete, however, because (as usual) $A → B$ is <em>not the only object</em> that fits in this formula. For example, the set $A → B ∧ C$ is also one such object, as is $A → B ∧ C ∧ D$ (not going to draw all the arrows here, because it will get too (and I mean too) messy).</p>

<p><img src="https://abuseofnotation.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/05_logic/implies_modus_ponens_impostors.svg" alt="Implies operation with universal property"></p>

<p>So how do we set apart the real formula from all those “imposter” formulas? If you remember the definitions of the <em>categorical product</em> (or of its equivalent for orders, the <em>meet</em> operation) you would already know where this is going: we recognize that $A \to B$ is the upper <em>limit</em> of $A → B ∧ C$ and $A → B ∧ C ∧ D$ and all other imposter formulas that can be in the place of $X$ in $A ∧ X → B$. The relationship can be described in a variety of ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We can say that $A \to B$ is the most <em>trivial</em> result for which the formula $A ∧ X → B$ is satisfied and that all other results are <em>stronger</em>.</li>
  <li>We can say that all other results imply $A \to B$ but not the other way around.</li>
  <li>We can say that all other formulas lie <em>below</em> $A → B$ in the Hasse diagram.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://abuseofnotation.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/05_logic/implies_universal_property.svg" alt="Implies operation with universal property"></p>

<p>So, after choosing the best way to express the relationship (they are all equivalent) we are ready to present our final definition:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The function object $A → B$ is the topmost object which is related to objects $A$ and $B$ in such a way that $A ∧ (A → B) → B$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The existence of this function object (called <em>exponential object</em> in category-theoretic terms) is the final condition for an order/lattice to be a representation of logic.</p>

<p>Note, by the way, that this definition of function object is valid specifically for intuinistic logic. For classical logic, the definition of  is simpler — there $A → B$ is just $\lnot A ∨ B$, because of the law of excluded middle.</p>

<h2 id="the-if-and-only-if-operation-2">The <em>if and only if</em> operation</h2>

<p>When we examined the <em>if and only if</em> operation can be defined in terms <em>implies</em>, that is $A \leftrightarrow B$ is equivalent to $A \to B \land B \to A$.</p>

<p><img src="https://abuseofnotation.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/05_logic/isomorphism.svg" alt="Implies identity"></p>

<p>We have something similar for categorical logic as well — We say that when two propositions are connected to each other, then, particularily when we speak of orders, they are isomorphic.</p>

<h2 id="a-taste-of-categorical-logic">A taste of categorical logic</h2>

<p>In the previous section we saw some definitions, here we will convince ourselves that they really capture the concept of logic correctly, by proving some results using categorical logic.</p>

<h2 id="true-and-false">True and False</h2>

<p>The join (or least upper bound) of the <em>topmost</em> object $\top$ (which plays the role of the value <em>True</em>) and any other object that you can think of, is… $\top$ itself (or something isomorphic to it, which, as we said, is the same thing). This follows trivially from the fact that the join of two objects must be bigger or equal than both of these objects, and that there is no other object that is bigger or equal to the $\top$ is $\top$ itself. This is simply because $\top$ (as any other object) is equal to itself and because there is by definition no object that is bigger than it.</p>

<p><img src="https://abuseofnotation.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/05_logic/join_true.svg" alt="Implies identity"></p>

<p>This corresponds to the logical statement that $A \lor \top$ is equal to $\top$ i.e. it is true. Hence, the above observation is a proof of that statement, (an alternative to truth tables).</p>

<p><strong>Task</strong>: Think of the duel situation, with False. What does it imply, logically?</p>

<h2 id="and-and-or">And and Or</h2>
<p>Above, we saw that the join between any random object and the top object is the top object itself. But, does this situation only occur when the second object is $\top$? Wouldn’t the same thing happen if $\top$ it is replaced by any other object that is higher than the first one?</p>

<p><img src="https://abuseofnotation.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/05_logic/join_bigger_true.svg" alt="Implies identity"></p>

<p>The answer is “Yes”: when we are looking for the join of two object, we are looking for the <em>least</em> upper bound i.e. the <em>lowest</em> object that is above both of them. So, any time we have two objects and one is higher than the other, their join would be (isomorphic to) the higher object.</p>

<p><img src="https://abuseofnotation.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/05_logic/join_bigger.svg" alt="Implies identity"></p>

<p>In other words, if $A \to B$, then $A \land B \leftrightarrow B$</p>

<h2 id="implies">Implies</h2>

<p>For our first example with implies, let’s take the formula $A → B$, and examine the case when $A$ and $B$ are the same object. We said that, $A → B$ ($A → A$ in our case) is the topmost object $X$ for which the criteria given by the formula $A ∧ X → B$ is satisfied. But in this case, the formula is satisfied for any $X$, (because it evaluates to $A ∧ X → A$, which is always true), i.e. the topmost object that satisfies it is… the topmost object there is i.e. (an object isomorphic to) $True$.</p>

<p><img src="https://abuseofnotation.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/05_logic/implies_identity.svg" alt="Implies identity"></p>

<p>Does this make sense? Of course it does: in fact, we just proved one of the most famous laws in logic (called the law of identity, as per Aristotel), namely that $A → A$ is always true, or that everything follows from itself.</p>

<p>And what happens if $A$ implies $B$ in any model, i.e. if $A \models B$ (semantic consequence)? In this case, $A$ would be below $B$ in our Hasse diagram (e.g. $A$ is the blue ball and $B$ is the orange one). Then the situation is somewhat similar to the previous case: $A ∧ X → B$ will be true, no matter what $X$ is (simply because $A$ already implies $B$, by itself). And so $A → B$ will again correspond to the $True$ object.</p>

<p><img src="https://abuseofnotation.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/05_logic/implies_b_follows.svg" alt="Implies when A follows from B"></p>

<p>This is again a well-known result in logic (if I am not mistaken, it will be a deduction theorem of some sort): if $A \models B$), then the statement $(A → B)$ will always be true.</p>

<!--
If and only if
---

Now for the a more complicated task: what would happen if $A$ is above $B$ i.e. if $B \models A$? What would the topmost object that fits the formula $(A ∧ X) → B$ then? Well, in this case there are many objects $A \land X$ that are also above $B$ and so they *don't* imply $B$. The highest such object that is below $B$ (so it can still imply $B$) would be... $B$ itself (as it literary sets the upper bound).

![Implies when B follows from A](../05_logic/implies_a_follows.svg)

Translated to logical language, this says that if we have $B \models A$, then the proof of $A → B$ coincides with the proof of $B$.

Classical VS intuitionistic logic
===

So, we already formulated the definition of intuitionistic logic in terms of order/lattice --- it is represented by a lattice that is bounded (i.e. has greatest and least objects ($True$ and $False$)) and that has function objects (the law of distributivity which we mentioned earlier is always true for lattices that have function object).

More interestingly, a lattice can follow the laws of *classical logic*, as well. it has to be *bounded* and *distributive* and in addition to that it has to be *complemented* which is to say that each proposition $A$, there exist an a unique proposition $\neg A$ (such that $A ∨ \neg A = 1$ and $A ∧ \neg A = 0$). These lattices are called *boolean algebras*.

Constructive proofs
---

Intuitionistic logic is also called *constructive* logic, or constructive mathematics. And the proofs in intuitionistic logic are constructive.


Proving a negative
---

If classical logic is based on the belief that everything is either true or false, intuitionistic logic gives precedence to the famous common-sense principle that *you cannot prove a negative*.

which means that while you can given a true statement and follow the arrows to reach other true statements, false statements would remain unreachable.

Given a logical system, consisting of axioms and rules of inference, I define positive statements as statements of the type "X follows from the axioms" and negative statements as statements of type  "X does not follow from the axioms".

Given those definitions, a positive statement is proven by just applying the rules of inference to the axioms until you reach the statement you want to prove, while there is no general way to prove a negative statement.

<p>24th October 2024</p>



<p>Anthropic <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/analysis-tool">released a new feature</a> for their <a href="http://claude.ai/">Claude.ai</a> consumer-facing chat bot interface today which they’re calling “the analysis tool”.</p>
<p>It’s their answer to OpenAI’s <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/code-interpreter/">ChatGPT Code Interpreter</a> mode: Claude can now chose to solve models by writing some code, executing that code and then continuing the conversation using the results from that execution.</p>
<p>You can enable the new feature on the <a href="https://claude.ai/new?fp=1">Claude feature flags page</a>.</p>
<p>I tried uploading a <code>uv.lock</code> dependency file (which uses TOML syntax) and telling it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Write a parser for this file format and show me a visualization of what's in it</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It gave me this:</p>
<p><img alt="Claude screenshot. I've uploaded a uv.lock file and prompted &quot;Write a parser for this file format and show me a visualization of what's in it&quot; Claude: I'll help create a parser and visualization for this lockfile format. It appears to be similar to a TOML-based lock file used in Python package management. Let me analyze the structure and create a visualization. Visible code: const fileContent = await window.fs.readFile('uv.lock', { encoding: 'utf8' }); function parseLockFile(content) ... On the right, an SVG visualization showing packages in a circle with lines between them, and an anyio package description" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/analysis-uv-lock.jpg"></p>
<p>Here’s <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/b25198899f92bdd7f15830567a07e319">that chat transcript</a> and <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/uv-lock-vis/index.html">the resulting artifact</a>. I upgraded my <a href="https://observablehq.com/@simonw/convert-claude-json-to-markdown">Claude transcript export tool</a> to handle the new feature, and hacked around with <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/23/claude-artifact-runner/">Claude Artifact Runner</a> (manually editing the source to replace <code>fs.readFile()</code> with a constant) to build the React artifact separately.</p>
<p>ChatGPT Code Interpreter (and the under-documented <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/code-execution">Google Gemini equivalent</a>) both work the same way: they write Python code which then runs in a secure sandbox on OpenAI or Google’s servers.</p>
<p>Claude does things differently. It uses JavaScript rather than Python, and it executes that JavaScript directly in your browser—in a locked down <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers">Web Worker</a> that communicates back to the main page by intercepting messages sent to <code>console.log()</code>.</p>
<p>It’s implemented as a tool called <code>repl</code>, and you can prompt Claude like this to reveal some of the custom instructions that are used to drive it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Show me the full description of the repl function</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/348b4ef2289cb5b1dee9aea9863bbc01">what I managed to extract</a> using that. This is how those instructions start:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What is the analysis tool?</strong></p>
<p>The analysis tool <em>is</em> a JavaScript REPL. You can use it just like you would use a REPL. But from here on out, we will call it the analysis tool.</p>
<p><strong>When to use the analysis tool</strong></p>
<p>Use the analysis tool for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complex math problems that require a high level of accuracy and cannot easily be done with “mental math”<ul>
<li>To give you the idea, 4-digit multiplication is within your capabilities, 5-digit multiplication is borderline, and 6-digit multiplication would necessitate using the tool.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Analyzing user-uploaded files, particularly when these files are large and contain more data than you could reasonably handle within the span of your output limit (which is around 6,000 words).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The analysis tool has access to a <code>fs.readFile()</code> function that can read data from files you have shared with your Claude conversation. It also has access to the <a href="https://lodash.com/">Lodash</a> utility library and <a href="https://www.papaparse.com/">Papa Parse</a> for parsing CSV content. The instructions say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can import available libraries such as lodash and papaparse in the analysis tool. However, note that the analysis tool is NOT a Node.js environment. Imports in the analysis tool work the same way they do in React. Instead of trying to get an import from the window, import using React style import syntax. E.g., you can write <code>import Papa from 'papaparse';</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m not sure why it says “libraries such as ...” there when as far as I can tell Lodash and papaparse are the <em>only</em> libraries it can load—unlike Claude Artifacts it can’t pull in other packages from its CDN.</p>
<p>The interaction between the analysis tool and Claude Artifacts is somewhat confusing. Here’s the relevant piece of the tool instructions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Code that you write in the analysis tool is <em>NOT</em> in a shared environment with the Artifact. This means:</p>
<ul>
<li>To reuse code from the analysis tool in an Artifact, you must rewrite the code in its entirety in the Artifact.</li>
<li>You cannot add an object to the <code>window</code> and expect to be able to read it in the Artifact. Instead, use the <code>window.fs.readFile</code> api to read the CSV in the Artifact after first reading it in the analysis tool.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A further limitation of the analysis tool is that any files you upload to it are currently added to the Claude context. This means there’s a size limit, and also means that only text formats work right now—you can’t upload a binary (as I found when I tried uploading <a href="https://github.com/sqlite/sqlite-wasm/tree/main/sqlite-wasm/jswasm">sqlite.wasm</a> to see if I could get it to use SQLite).</p>
<p>Anthropic’s Alex Albert says <a href="https://twitter.com/alexalbert__/status/1849501507005149515">this will change in the future</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yep currently the data is within the context window—we’re working on moving it out.</p>
</blockquote>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Historically, we could link to a certain part of the page only if that part had an ID. All we needed to do was to link to the URL and add the <em>document fragment</em> (ID). If we wanted to link to a certain part of the page, we needed to anchor that part to link to it. This was until we were blessed with the <strong><a href="https://wicg.github.io/scroll-to-text-fragment/">Text fragments</a></strong>!</p>

<h3 id="what-are-text-fragments">What are Text fragments?</h3>

<p>Text fragments are a powerful feature of the modern web platform that allows for precise linking to specific text within a web page without the need to add an anchor! This feature is complemented by the <code>::target-text</code> CSS pseudo-element, which provides a way to style the highlighted text.</p>

<p>Text fragments work by appending a special syntax to the end of a URL; just like we used to append the ID after the hash symbol (<code>#</code>). The browser interprets this part of the URL, searches for the specified text on the page, and then scrolls to and highlights that text if it supports text fragments. If the user attempts to navigate the document by pressing tab, the focus will move on to the next focusable element after the text fragment.</p>
<h3 id="how-can-we-use-it">How can we use it?</h3>

<p>Here’s the basic syntax for a text fragment URL:</p>

<pre><code>
https://example.com/page.html#:~:text=[prefix-,]textStart[,textEnd][,-suffix]

</code></pre>

<p>Following the hash symbol, we add this special syntax <code>:~:</code> also known as <em>fragment directive</em> then <code>text=</code> followed by:</p>

<ol>
  <li><code>prefix-</code>: A text string preceded by a hyphen specifying what text should immediately precede the linked text. This helps the browser to link to the correct text in case of multiple matches. This part is not highlighted.</li>
  <li><code>textStart</code>: The beginning of the text you’re highlighting.</li>
  <li><code>textEnd</code>: The ending of the text you’re highlighting.</li>
  <li><code>-suffix</code>: A hyphen followed by a text string that behaves similarly to the prefix but comes after the text. Aslo helpful when multiple matches exist and doesn’t get highlighted with the linked text.</li>
</ol>

<p>For example, the following link:</p>

<pre><code>
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/URI/Fragment/Text_fragments#:~:text=without%20relying%20on%20the%20presence%20of%20IDs

</code></pre>

<p>This text fragment we are using is “without relying on the presence of IDs” but it’s <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURIComponent">encoded</a>. If you follow <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/URI/Fragment/Text_fragments#:~:text=without%20relying%20on%20the%20presence%20of%20IDs">this link</a>, it should look like the following:</p>

<p><img src="https://alfy.blog/images/2024/02/screenshot-01.png" alt="Screenshot from Google Chrome showing how highlighted text fragment look in Google Chrome"></p>

<p>We can also highlight a range of text by setting the <code>startText</code> and the <code>endText</code>. Consider the following example from the same URL:</p>

<pre><code>
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/URI/Fragment/Text_fragments#:~:text=using%20particular,don't%20control

</code></pre>

<p>The text fragment we are using is “using particular” followed by a comma then “don’t control”. If you follow <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/URI/Fragment/Text_fragments#:~:text=using%20particular,don't%20control">this link</a>, it should look like the following:</p>

<p><img src="https://alfy.blog/images/2024/02/screenshot-02.png" alt="Screenshot from Google Chrome showing highlighted text fragment with start text and end text"></p>

<p>We can also highlight multiple texts by using ampersands. Consider the following:</p>

<pre><code>
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/URI/Fragment/Text_fragments#:~:text=using%20particular&amp;text=it%20allows

</code></pre>

<p>If you follow <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/URI/Fragment/Text_fragments#:~:text=using%20particular&amp;text=it%20allows">this link</a>, it should look like the following:</p>

<p><img src="https://alfy.blog/images/2024/02/screenshot-03.png" alt="Screenshot from Google Chrome showing different highlighted text fragment"></p>

<p>One of the interesting behaviors about text fragments, is if you’re linking to hidden content that’s discoverable through <em>find-in-page</em> feature (e.g. children of element with hidden attribute set to <code>until-found</code> or content of a closed details element), the hidden content will become visible. Let’s look at this behavior by linking to <a href="https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2022/09/12/details-summary.html">this article</a> from Scott O’Hara’s blog. The blog contains the details element that is closed by default.</p>

<p><img src="https://alfy.blog/images/2024/02/screenshot-04.png" alt="Screenshot from Scott O'Hara's blog showing a details section"></p>

<p>If we <a href="https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2022/09/12/details-summary.html#:~:text=Oh%20hi%20there.%20Forget%20your%20summary,%20didja">linked to the text fragment</a> inside the details element, it will open automatically:</p>

<pre><code>
https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2022/09/12/details-summary.html#:~:text=Oh%20hi%20there.%20Forget%20your%20summary,%20didja

</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://alfy.blog/images/2024/02/screenshot-05.png" alt="Screenshot from Scott O'Hara's blog showing a details section and it opens because it matches the text fragment inside the details section"></p>

<p><strong>Note</strong> that this behavior is <strong>only available in Google Chrome</strong> as it’s the only browser to support discoverable content.</p>

<h3 id="styling-highlighted-fragments">Styling highlighted fragments</h3>

<p>If the browser supports text fragments, we can change the style of the highlighted text by using the <code>::target-text</code> pseudo-element</p>

<pre><code>::target-text {
    background-color: yellow;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that we are only allowed to change the following properties:</p>

<ul>
  <li>color</li>
  <li>background-color</li>
  <li>text-decoration and its associated properties (including text-underline-position and text-underline-offset)</li>
  <li>text-shadow</li>
  <li>stroke-color, fill-color, and stroke-width</li>
  <li>custom properties</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="browser-support-and-fallback-behaviour">Browser support and fallback behaviour</h3>

<p>Text fragments are currently <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-html_elements_a_text_fragments">supported in all the browsers</a>. The pseudo-element <code>::target-text</code> is not yet supported is Safari but it’s now available in the Technology Preview version. If this feature is not supported in the browser, it will degrade gracefully and the page will load without highlighting or scrolling to the text.</p>

<p>The default style for the highlight is different based on the browser. The color of the highlight is different across the different browsers. The highlighted area is bigger in Safari spanning the whole line-height. In Firefox and Chrome, only the text is highlighted and the spaces between the lines are empty.</p>

<p><img src="https://alfy.blog/images/2024/02/comparison.png" alt="Demonstration of the differences in text highlight between the different browsers"></p>

<p>We can detect if the feature is supported or not using <code>document.fragmentDirective</code>. It will return an empty FragmentDirective object, if supported or will return undefined if it’s not.</p>

<h3 id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</h3>

<p>My first encounter with text fragments was through links generated by Google Search results. Initially, I assumed it was a Chrome-specific feature and not part of a broader web standard. However, I soon realized that this functionality was actually built upon the open web, available to any browser that chooses to implement it.</p>

<p>I’d love to see this feature used more broadly, particularly by responsible generative AI systems. Imagine AI that can provide direct, context-sensitive links to the exact content you’re interested in, using text fragments for precise references. This would not only increase transparency but also improve the user experience when navigating AI-generated content.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, it would be fantastic if text fragments were more accessible to all users, not just those with technical knowledge. What if browsers offered built-in features that allowed non-technical users to highlight text and generate links to specific paragraphs with ease? This could be through a native browser feature or even a simple browser extension—either way, it would make deep linking a breeze for everyone.</p>

<p>Finally, I’d like to express my sincere thanks to <a href="https://hannaholukoye.com/">Hannah Olukoye</a> and <a href="https://meiert.com/">Jens Oliver Meiert</a> for the time they’ve taken to share their invaluable feedback and corrections.</p>

<h3 id="update-20th-oct-2024">Update, 20th Oct, 2024</h3>

<p>It turns out that the ability to generate a link to a specific piece of text is already built into Chromium-based browsers, as <a href="https://x.com/HosamSultan_">Hostam Sultan</a> <a href="https://x.com/HosamSultan_/status/1847768998349328553">clarified on X</a> (formerly Twitter). If you’re using Chrome, simply highlight some text, right-click, and you’ll find the “Copy link to highlight” option in the context menu.</p>
