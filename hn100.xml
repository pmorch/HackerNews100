At least one DOGE ally appears to be working to open back doors into systems used throughout the federal government. Thomas Shedd, a former Tesla engineer who was recently appointed director of the Technology Transformation Services, requested privileged access to 19 different IT systems administered by teams within TTS, according to two federal workers we spoke with who are familiar with his request. With this level of control, Shedd would be able to not only view and modify federal data, but also grant and revoke access to other people. (In a written statement, Will Powell, the acting press secretary for the General Services Administration, of which TTS is a part, said Shedd needs this level of access to rapidly identify “areas for optimization and efficiencies” and insisted that he is working with “appropriate GSA officials” to follow established protocols.)</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-0" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 1" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="1"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/02/elon-musk-doge-security/681600/">Read: The government’s computing experts say they are terrified</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Over the past few days, we’ve talked with civil servants working for numerous agencies, all of whom requested anonymity because they fear what will happen if they lose their job—not just to themselves, but to the functioning of the federal government. Their observations reveal the abnormal degree of power that DOGE has already achieved. Federal agencies are subject to various forms of administrative and legal oversight, but they operate separately from one another for good reasons: to support a specialized purpose and to insulate them from undue outside influence. Now they effectively roll up to Elon Musk. (Neither the White House nor DOGE responded to requests for comment for this story. Earlier this week, a White House official <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/us/politics/elon-musk-doge-leader.html">claimed</a> that Musk is not the head of DOGE. He is clearly the group’s functional leader.)</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Among the federal agencies we reported on, USAID is the only one where we could confirm that DOGE has acquired God-mode access across the entire digital system. (The Trump administration has sought to effectively shut down USAID since the inauguration.) But as Musk and his acolytes enter a growing number of federal databases and IT systems, their unfettered access at USAID offers a sense of what they might be able to do elsewhere. At NASA, for example, it could mean access to knowledge about sensitive government technologies used for defense. At the CDC, such ability could expose millions of Americans’ health data and allow DOGE to access labs that store deadly pathogens. At Treasury, such access would allow Musk’s employees to view Americans’ names, Social Security numbers, and financial information. “It is not ridiculous to think they’d have bank-account and routing numbers for every single person in the United States,” the senior USAID source said. “What do you do with this information? I had to ask myself, <em>Do I file my taxes this year or not?</em> I had to sit and debate that.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The federal government does not typically grant such wide-ranging access to a single entity, let alone one that is effectively under the control of an unelected, erratic, and politically extreme actor such as Musk. The group is working on behalf of Donald Trump, but sources we spoke with emphasized that the level of access DOGE possesses means that the organization may already be able to siphon data that Musk or his agents could hold on to forever, long after his time as a government liaison, or even after a potential falling-out with the president.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">One experienced government information-security contractor offered a blunt response to the God-mode situation at USAID: “That sounds like our worst fears come true.” The purpose of DOGE’s incursions remains unclear to employees at these agencies. Musk was supposed to help improve the workings of the government—that is DOGE’s stated purpose. But in the offices where the team is reaching internal IT systems, some are beginning to worry that he might prefer to destroy it, to take it over, or just to loot its vaults for himself.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true" data-flatplan-dropcap="true">“O<span>nce they’re in, they’re in</span>,” the USAID employee told us. And this is a big part of the problem in a nutshell: Access is everything, and in many cases, DOGE has it.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">At USAID and other agencies whose employees we spoke with, leaders explained that Musk’s team could copy and remove information from government servers without anybody knowing. The team could then feed this classified information into AI tools, either for training purposes or to mine the data for insights. (Members of DOGE already reportedly <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/02/06/elon-musk-doge-ai-department-education/">have put sensitive data</a> from the Education Department into AI software.) Within USAID, DOGE has full access to human-resources information—Social Security numbers, addresses, reputational data such as performance reviews, plus classified information and disciplinary information. The USAID source noted that DOGE can also control USAID systems that help with disbursement of funds, building-access tools, and payroll: “If they wanted to change how much a person is making, they could modify that, given their access in the system.” According to the employee, DOGE is also inside of an internal system for managing contracts and grants, which functions like a high-security online marketplace where USAID plans and approves billions in government spending.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Inside NASA, according to one agency employee we spoke with, DOGE workers already have access to contracts, partnerships, performance reviews, classified national-security information, and satellite data, among other materials. The NASA worker told us that such knowledge could erase generations of advantage in aerospace and defense capabilities if it falls into the wrong hands. Agency technologies such as propulsion systems, novel materials, and satellites overlap with Department of Defense projects. Someone with information about NASA’s thermal-protection or encryption technologies could take advantage of vulnerabilities in aerospace vehicles, for example.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-1" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 2" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="2"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/02/musk-terror-reign/681731/">Derek Thompson: DOGE’s reign of ineptitude </a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">USAID employees have felt more acute effects of DOGE’s operations. Employees there say they have been rattled by the demands of DOGE engineers: “They have walked in and said to senior staff,<em> You have 15 minutes to do this or you’re fired</em>,” the USAID senior leader told us. Now USAID staff are “operating in a zero-trust environment.” With its God-mode IT control at the agency, DOGE can read emails and chats, plus see who’s attending which meetings. The source described employees in a recent meeting growing alarmed when transcription services seemed to turn on without warning. An employee at NASA reported similar concerns, after unfamiliar messages appeared on workstations. “We’re operating believing our systems are completely bugged,” one person told us.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The senior USAID official fears that DOGE could terminate somebody working in a conflict zone like Ukraine, Sudan, or Ethiopia from an agency system. “If they lose access to their USAID laptop, phone, and accounts, for a lot of them that’s their only means of communication. We are putting their lives on the line,” one said.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">For those who have watched DOGE storm into their workplace, what is perhaps most terrifying is its attempts to scale. If DOGE were to acquire God-mode administrative access across many systems, several sources told us, that level of control could affect every citizen at home, and many American interests abroad: personal financial data, defense secrets, and more, all in the palm of Musk’s hand.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true" data-flatplan-dropcap="true">T<span>here’s reason to believe</span> that health information may be next. The Trump administration fired roughly <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/02/18/trump-health-firings-fda-cdc/">700</a> people at the CDC last weekend. As in other agencies, the firings will hollow out expertise but also remove obstacles to further changes. A CDC employee told us that the agency’s Office of the Chief Information Officer is expecting DOGE, but “no one has seen anyone yet.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The individual, who has knowledge of how CDC information systems work, fears that DOGE could gain access to an abundant store of sensitive information about health and disease. This year, the CDC is supposed to roll out a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/public-health-data-strategy/php/about/index.html">central data platform</a> for public-health surveillance and emergency response to better address new threats such as H5N1 bird flu and old ones such as <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-texas-mmr-vaccine-homeschooling-b29d08d53cf26704968e8c00dfa712ba">measles</a>. The new system, called the One CDC Data Platform, promises to aggregate all of the CDC’s public-health data, including hundreds of thousands of daily anonymized lab tests, data from emergency-room visits, and measurements from wastewater disease-reporting sites.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The design and rollout of this system were already controversial inside the agency, our source said, even before Trump and Musk came on the scene. Putting everybody’s health data in one place carries risks. Although the health data the CDC houses are usually de-identified or aggregated, “people with very stigmatizing illnesses could be identified by certain characteristics” if the data are exposed or misused, the CDC worker said. What’s more, plenty of health data contain information that, when correlated with other data outside the system, could pinpoint specific individuals. Given all of the data that DOGE appears to be capable of siphoning from all over the government, such identification could become much easier. The CDC collects electronic health-record details from all over the country, meaning that this could affect just about everyone—including us, and you too.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">CDC systems control more than mere information about disease. At the agency’s facility in Atlanta, the CDC stores the microbes that cause disease and can hold secrets to treatment. Some are relatively benign, such as strains of <em>E. coli</em>. Others are intrinsically dangerous, including the Ebola and Marburg viruses, and bacterium that causes tuberculosis. These materials are housed in labs with associated biosafety levels. The highest level, BSL-4, applies to only a small number of labs around the world containing “dangerous and exotic” microbes, as the CDC <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/training/quicklearns/biosafety/#:~:text=%C2%AB%20Prev%20Page-,BSL%2D4,include%20Ebola%20and%20Marburg%20viruses">describes</a> them, that pose a high risk of spread.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Access to such labs is managed by computers, and management of those computers is local to the CDC. If DOGE got the same kind of access to CDC IT systems as it has elsewhere, would that give the group direct access to CDC facilities? “Yes, those are all out of CDC level,” our source at the agency told us. Does that mean that DOGE could gain direct access to BSL-4 labs? we asked. “It’s definitely possible,” the employee said.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-2" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 3" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="3"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/02/elon-musk-doge-nuclear-weapons/681581/">Read: If DOGE goes nuclear</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Our source hoped that such a prospect would be averted. (To repeat, DOGE hasn’t taken control of CDC IT systems yet, at least as far as our source knew.) But the employee also explained that the recent layoffs will reduce the agency’s ability to defend against IT or security errors, on top of diminishing morale. The CDC did not respond to requests for comment about whether someone with full, local IT control could indeed grant entry to, or control over, BSL-4 labs and their contents.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true" data-flatplan-dropcap="true">T<span>he risk of harm, abuse, or political revenge</span> is clear. But simple, brazen corruption is also a concern among the federal workers we spoke with. The CDC staffer wondered if DOGE’s unelected and seemingly unaccountable leadership, including Musk, might simply want to sell the public-health data the CDC collects. Democratic leaders have also expressed the worry that Musk’s interest in SpaceX, which has received billions of dollars in contracts from NASA over the years, creates an untenable conflict of interest. The NASA employee worried that Musk would end up “reaping all of the profits of the investment that the American public put into NASA’s research, which was being shared with the country.” NASA holds technical specs and research data for SpaceX competitors, and insiders fear that such information will soon be compromised, too. They also worry that classified NASA R&amp;D in areas such as quantum, biotech, and astrobiology could be stolen for private gain.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">A number of lawsuits have been filed seeking to limit DOGE’s access, with <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/judges-consider-barring-musks-doge-team-government-systems-2025-02-14/">mixed results</a>. Meanwhile, Trump and Musk have both <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-allies-ramp-up-attacks-judges-musk-calls-impeachments-2025-02-12/">attacked</a> judges who have ruled against their interests; Musk has said they should be impeached. Trump has also indicated that he might just <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/02/trump-vance-courts/681632/">ignore the courts</a>—an act that would be <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/16/opinion/what-if-trump-defies-courts.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare">challenging to counter, providing plenty of opportunity for the administration to get its way.</a> Across agencies, leaders have started to step aside voluntarily. Jim Jones, head of the Food and Drug Administration’s food division, resigned this week. Michelle King, who ran the Social Security Administration, stepped down too rather than carry out DOGE’s wishes. The resignations may be principled, but they open the door for more compliant replacements.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The request from Shedd, the former Tesla engineer, in particular, illustrates the variety of avenues and back doors that DOGE and Musk’s allies may have available to enter the government’s systems. According to the two federal workers we spoke with about Shedd’s efforts, such access typically is not granted to TTS leadership and requires a specific reason and the permission of each system’s owner. Shedd initially issued a blanket request, the sources told us, and is now attempting to bypass the individual system owners by seeking permission from other officials, circumventing standard security procedures. He also had not completed a background check, which is usually required for such access, at least as of when he first made the request, according to our sources. How much access Shedd has been granted remains uncertain.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">This is the DOGE playbook: There are no norms to be respected, and everything is up for grabs. Once the damage is done, it will be difficult to remedy, especially if DOGE staffers can themselves grant or remove access to others at their discretion.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Musk and DOGE’s first month has been so chaotic, their incursions so haphazard, that assessing what has even happened is difficult. DOGE claims to be improving the government, but the agency workers we spoke with feel that they are being hacked instead. So it is worth stepping back to note the most basic fact: No good reason or case can be made for one person or entity to have this scope of access to this many government agencies containing this much sensitive information. Even in one government office, full administrative access to all systems is the rarest privilege. In the aggregate, across the whole of the government, it would be unfathomable.</p></section><div data-event-module="footer"><p><h3>About the Authors</h3></p><div><address id="article-writer-0" data-event-element="author" data-event-position="1" data-flatplan-bio="true"><div><p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/charlie-warzel/" data-event-element="image"><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/lyW9wA_jPYje_sXRDGnpW8Gl4Kk=/54x0:1756x1702/120x120/media/img/authors/2022/11/IMG_0264/original.jpg" width="60" height="60"></a></p></div></address></div><div><address id="article-writer-1" data-event-element="author" data-event-position="2" data-flatplan-bio="true"><div><p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/ian-bogost/" data-event-element="image"><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/dMbJwBoshVoOt2SGSV-7Y1D29xI=/38x38:1890x1890/120x120/media/None/ibogost_atlantic_new/original.jpg" width="60" height="60"></a></p></div></address></div><div><address id="article-writer-2" data-event-element="author" data-event-position="3" data-flatplan-bio="true"><div><p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/matteo-wong/" data-event-element="image"><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/cvqkiGqr5oeTvJi706qtcaOkivk=/815x349:3584x3118/120x120/media/img/authors/2023/06/Matteo_Wong/original.jpg" width="60" height="60"></a></p></div></address></div></div><gpt-ad format="injector" sizes-at-0="mobile-wide,native,house" targeting-pos="injector-most-popular" sizes-at-976="desktop-wide,native,house"></gpt-ad></article></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-8669">
				
<p><strong>Q1.</strong> Did you <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/quantum/2025/02/19/microsoft-unveils-majorana-1-the-worlds-first-quantum-processor-powered-by-topological-qubits/">see</a> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00527-z">Microsoft’s</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/technology/microsoft-quantum-computing-topological-qubit.html">announcement</a>?<br>A. Yes, thanks, you can stop emailing to ask!  Microsoft’s Chetan Nayak was even kind enough to give me a personal briefing a few weeks ago.  Yesterday I did a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/w3ct60h5">brief interview</a> on this for the BBC’s World Business Report, and I also <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/02/19/1112072/a-new-microsoft-chip-could-lead-to-more-stable-quantum-computers/">commented</a> for MIT Technology Review.</p>



<p><strong>Q2.</strong> What <em>is</em> a topological qubit?<br><strong>A.</strong> It’s a special kind of qubit built using nonabelian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anyon">anyons</a>, which are excitations that can exist in a two-dimensional medium, behaving neither as fermions nor as bosons.  The idea grew out of seminal work by Alexei Kitaev, Michael Freedman, and others starting in the late 1990s.  Topological qubits have proved harder to create and control than ordinary qubits.</p>



<p><strong>Q3.</strong> Then why do people care about topological qubits?<br><strong>A.</strong> The dream is that they could <em>eventually</em> be more resilient to decoherence than regular qubits, since an error, in order to matter, needs to change the <em>topology</em> of how the nonabelian anyons are braided around each other.  So you’d have some robustness built in to the physics of your system, rather than having to engineer it laboriously at the software level (via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold_theorem">quantum fault-tolerance</a>).</p>



<p><strong>Q4.</strong> Did Microsoft create the first topological qubit?<br><strong>A.</strong> Well, they say they did!</p>



<p><strong>Q5.</strong> Didn’t Microsoft claim the experimental creation of Majorana zero modes—a building block of topological qubits—back in 2018, and didn’t they then need to <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/majorana-microsoft-backed-quantum-computer-research-retracted">retract</a> that claim?<br><strong>A.</strong> Yep.  Certainly that history is making some experts cautious about the new claim.  When I asked Chetan Nayak how confident I should be, his response was basically “look, we now have a topological qubit that’s behaving fully as a qubit; how much more do people want?”</p>



<p><strong>Q6.</strong> Is this a big deal?<br><strong>A.</strong> <em>If</em> the claim stands, I’d say it’s a scientific milestone for the field of topological quantum computing and physics beyond.  The number of topological qubits manipulated in a single experiment has then finally increased from 0 to 1, and depending on how you define things, arguably a “new state of matter” has even been created, one that doesn’t appear in nature (but only in <em>Nature</em>).</p>



<p><strong>Q7.</strong> Is this useful?<br><strong>A.</strong> Not yet!  If anyone claims that a single qubit, or even 30 qubits, are already <em>useful</em> for speeding up computation, you can ignore anything else that person says.  (Certainly Microsoft makes no such claim.)  On the question of what we believe quantum computers will or won’t <em>eventually</em> be useful for, see like half the archives of this blog over the past twenty years.</p>



<p><strong>Q8.</strong> Does this announcement vindicate topological qubits as the way forward for quantum computing?<br><strong>A.</strong> Think of it this way.  <em>If</em> Microsoft’s claim stands, then topological qubits have finally reached some sort of parity with where more traditional qubits were 20-30 years ago.  I.e., the non-topological approaches like superconducting, trapped-ion, and neutral-atom have an absolutely <em>massive</em> head start: there, Google, IBM, Quantinuum, QuEra, and other companies now routinely do experiments with dozens or even hundreds of entangled qubits, and thousands of two-qubit gates.  Topological qubits can win if, and only if, they turn out to be <em>so much</em> more reliable that they leapfrog the earlier approaches—sort of like the transistor did to the vacuum tube and electromechanical relay.  Whether that will happen is still an open question, to put it extremely mildly.</p>



<p><strong>Q9.</strong> Are there other major experimental efforts to build topological qubits?<br><strong>A.</strong> No, it’s pretty much just Microsoft.  Purely as a scientist who likes to see things tried, I’m grateful that one player stuck with the topological approach even when it ended up being a long, painful slog.</p>



<p><strong>Q10.</strong> Is Microsoft now on track to scale to a million topological qubits in the next few years?<br><strong>A.</strong> In the world of corporate PR and pop-science headlines, sure, why not?  As Bender from <em>Futurama</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGZ10kZ4lmE">says</a>, “I can guarantee anything you want!” In the world of reality, a “few years” certainly feels overly aggressive to me, but good luck to Microsoft and good luck to its competitors!  I foresee exciting times ahead, provided we still have a functioning civilization in which to enjoy them.</p>

          <strong>Magma</strong> is the <span><em>first</em></span> foundation model that is capable of interpreting and grounding multimodal inputs within its environment. Given a described goal, <strong>Magma</strong> is able to formulate plans and execute actions to achieve it. By effectively transferring knowledge from freely available visual and language data, <strong>Magma</strong> bridges verbal, spatial and temporal intelligence to navigate complex tasks and settings.

      <div>
          <p>
            We present <strong>Magma</strong>, a foundation model serving multimodal AI agentic tasks in both the digital and physical worlds.  <strong>Magma</strong> is a significant extension of vision-language (VL) models in that the former not only retains the VL understanding ability (verbal intelligence) of the latter, but is also equipped with the ability to plan and act in the visual-spatial world (spatial intelligence) and to complete agentic tasks ranging from UI navigation to robot manipulation.
            <strong>Magma</strong> is pretrained on large amounts of heterogeneous VL datasets including images, videos and robotics data, where the actionable visual objects (e.g., clickable buttons in GUI) in images are labeled by Set-of-Mark (SoM) and the object movements (e.g., the trace of a robotic arm) in videos are labeled by Trace-of-Mark (ToM). 
            Extensive experiments show that SoM and ToM facilitate the acquisition of spatial intelligence from large-scale training data.
            <strong>Magma</strong> creates new state-of-the-art results on UI navigation and robotic manipulation tasks, outperforming previous models that are tailored specifically to these tasks. On VL tasks, Magma also compares favorably to popular VL models that are trained on much larger datasets.

              <p><strong>Magma pretraining pipeline. </strong>For all training data, texts are tokenized into tokens, while images and videos from different domains
                are encoded by a shared vision encoder. The resulted discrete and continuous tokens are then fed into a LLM to generate the outputs in
                verbal, spatial and action types.

              <p><strong><u>Magma</u></strong>: The video takes place in a convenience store, focusing on the checkout counter. It begins with a view of the counter displaying a sign that reads 'PICK 5 FOR $8.00' along with images of various snacks. The counter is filled with various items, including snacks and a payment terminal. An employee, wearing a black shirt with white sleeves, is seen handling the payment terminal. A customer, identifiable by their white sleeve and colorful bracelet, places a red shopping basket filled with snacks and a drink on the counter. The employee continues to operate the payment terminal while the customer adjusts the items in the basket. The interaction between the customer and the employee is highlighted, with the employee assisting the customer with the items.                 The scene continues at the same checkout counter, with the 'PICK 5 FOR $8.00' sign still prominently displayed. The customer's red shopping basket, now filled with snacks including a drink cup labeled 'Fruit Swoosh' and a blue package of cookies, is placed on the counter. The employee is seen handling the payment terminal. The customer's hand, adorned with a colorful bracelet, interacts with the items in the basket. The employee continues to assist the customer, adjusting the items on the counter. The interaction between the customer and the employee remains the focal point, with the employee assisting the customer with the items. The person behind the counter is likely to process the payment and possibly hand over the items.</p>

              <p><strong><u>Magma</u></strong>: The video begins with a close-up of a hand reaching for a red potted plant placed on a wooden shelf. The plant has green and yellow-striped leaves and is accompanied by a book titled 'YOUNG' and a wooden bowl stacked on top of each other. The hand carefully adjusts the position of the plant on the shelf, ensuring it is properly placed. The background includes a beige watering can hanging on a stand and a radiator with white pipes. The hand then adjusts the plant once more, making sure it is centered on the shelf. The scene develops as the hand, now wearing a yellow sweater and a ring on the left hand, reaches out to adjust the plant's position once more. The hand then moves away from the plant, and the camera shifts to show more of the surrounding area, including a red high chair and a wooden countertop with various items, such as a smartphone and a small red cup. The video wraps up with a wider view of the room, revealing a checkered floor and several other plants in the background, adding a homely touch to the setting.</p>

<p>On Jan. 20, United States President Donald Trump signed an executive order renaming the “Gulf of Mexico” to “Gulf of America.” Last week, Google Maps officially changed the name of the gulf on its maps, sparking a flurry of memes and conversation on social media, and Mexico is now threatening legal action if they don’t change it back.</p>
<p>In a&nbsp;press conference on Monday, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said that Mexico will sue Google if the company does not change the “Gulf of America” label to cover only the portion of the body of water under U.S. jurisdiction, which is just a small portion of the gulf.</p>

<p>Sheinbaum argues that Donald Trump and the United States do not have the authority to rename the entire gulf and that the executive order applies only to the United States continental shelf.</p>
<p>“We’re talking about 22 nautical miles, not the entire gulf,” Sheinbaum said <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mexico-lawsuit-threat-google-maps-gulf-of-america-2025-2">according to Business Insider</a>.</p>

<p>Sheinbaum pointed out that Google has also changed the name of the continental shelves of Mexico and Cuba when those two countries have not changed the name themselves.</p>

<p>In a letter to Google, Sheinbaum made it clear that Mexico will not&nbsp;accept the renaming of any geographical area that includes its national territory or that falls under its jurisdiction.</p>
<p>“Any reference to the ‘Gulf of America’ initiative on your Google Maps platform must be exclusively limited to the marine area under US jurisdiction,” the letter read. “Any extension beyond that zone exceeds the authority of any national government or private entity. Should that be the case, the Government of Mexico will take the appropriate legal actions as deemed necessary.”</p>

<p>Sheinbaum said that it’s possible that the nation could sue Google in civil court over the matter, but they will await Google’s response to their most recent letter before proceeding with legal action.</p>

<p>Even “no-logs” VPNs see both your identity and your internet activity, meaning you have to blindly trust their pinky-promise for privacy. This is exactly why some privacy-conscious folks will tell you not to use a VPN at all.</p>
<p>Obscura is different – we never see your decrypted internet packets. It’s simply <em>impossible</em> for us to log your internet activity, even if we were compelled to, or if our servers were compromised. You can even <a href="#faq-trust">verify this yourself</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Obscura’s stealth protocol is much harder to block.</strong></p>
<p>Our unique stealth protocol is designed to blend in with regular internet traffic. It does so by leveraging QUIC – the same technology that powers HTTP/3 – making it far harder for censors or network filters to detect or block.</p>

<p>Thanks for reaching the bottom — not everyone makes it.</p>
<p>I’m incredibly lucky to have the help of a crack(ed) team of privacy optimists to build Obscura.</p>
<p>Among us, we’ve served on the Nix RFC Steering Committee, implemented the 64bit random number generator for the Go standard library, fixed critical vulnerabilities for hardware security tokens, won bounties for Monero bugs, and contributed to Bitcoin for reproducible builds.</p>
<p>But while privacy and digital sovereignty in some worlds has made leaps and bounds, VPNs have been left behind; peddling privacy based on promises instead of privacy baked into the architecture.</p>
<p>So we’re taking our skills to build Obscura: a VPN you can depend on to get the most out of our glorious digital commons – the internet. It’s the VPN we’ve always wanted to use, and it’s the kind of privacy we believe everyone should have access to.</p>

Designed and engineered to test the energy efficiency of a larger building, it’s full of sensors that monitor the impact of everyday activities on indoor air quality.</p><p>“To understand how airborne particles form indoors, you need to measure the smallest nanoparticles – down to a single nanometer,” said Brandon Boor, associate professor in civil engineering at Purdue and the study’s other corresponding author. “At this scale, we can observe the earliest stages of new particle formation, where fragrances react with ozone to form tiny molecular clusters.”</p><p>The researchers knew from their <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsestair.4c00118" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">previous research</a> that new nanoparticle formation was initiated by terpenes – aromatic compounds that determine the smell of things like plants and herbs – released from the melts and reacting with indoor atmospheric ozone (O<sub>3</sub>). They’d found that activities such as mopping the floor with a terpene-rich cleaning agent, using a citrus-scented air freshener, or applying scented personal care products like deodorant inside the zEDGE house resulted in pulsed terpene emissions to the indoor air within five minutes. Conversely, using essential oil diffusers or peeling citrus fruits caused a more gradual increase in terpenes.</p><p>In the present study, heating the scented wax contributed significantly to the number of new particles formed in the indoor air, particularly those smaller than 100 nanometers (nm). The resulting atmospheric concentrations were over one million nanoparticles per cubic centimeter (10<sup>6</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>), which is comparable to concentrations emitted by traditional lighted candles (10<sup>6</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>), gas stoves (10<sup>5</sup> – 10<sup>7</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>), diesel engines (10<sup>3</sup> – 10<sup>6</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>), and natural gas engines (10<sup>6</sup> – 10<sup>7</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>). By comparison, there were no significant terpene emissions when unscented wax melts were heated.</p><div data-align-center="">

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.sylver.dev/build-your-own-sqlite-part-5-evaluating-queries">https://blog.sylver.dev/build-your-own-sqlite-part-5-evaluating-queries</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43108614">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-content-parent"><p>In the previous posts, we've explored the
<a target="_blank" href="https://blog.sylver.dev/build-your-own-sqlite-part-1-listing-tables">SQLite file format</a> and built a
simple <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.sylver.dev/build-your-own-sqlite-part-3-sql-parsing-101">SQL parser</a>. It's time
to put these pieces together and implement a query evaluator!
In this post, we'll lay the groundwork for evaluating SQL queries and build a
query evaluator that can handle basic SELECT statements. While our initial implementation
won't support filtering, sorting, grouping, or joins yet, it will give us the
foundation to add these features in future posts.</p>
<p>As usual, the complete source code for this post is available
on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/geoffreycopin/rqlite/commit/c7dfeeea6956e209ccbd50a727c2b9352c246082">GitHub</a>.</p>
<h2 id="heading-setting-up-our-test-database">Setting up our test database</h2>
<p>Before we can evaluate queries, we need a database to query. We'll start by
creating a simple database with a single table, <code>table1</code>, with two columns,
<code>id</code> and <code>value</code>:</p>
<pre><code>sqlite3 queries_test.db
sqlite&gt; create table table1(id <span>integer</span>, value text);
sqlite&gt; insert into table1(id, value) values
    ...&gt; (1, <span>'11'</span>),
    ...&gt; (2, <span>'12'</span>),
    ...&gt; (3, <span>'13'</span>);
sqlite&gt; .<span>exit</span>
</code></pre>
<p>⚠️ You might be tempted to use an existing SQLite database to test your queries,
but keep in mind that our implementation does not support overflow pages yet,
so it might not be able to read the data from your database file.</p>

<hr>
<p>This section is specific to the Rust implementation. If you're following along
with another language, you can safely skip it!</p>
<hr>
<p>Currently, our pager can only be used through an exclusive mutable reference.
This was fine for our initial use cases, but as we start building more complex
features, maintaining this restriction will constrain our design.
We'll make the pager shareable by wrapping its inner mutable fields in an
<code>Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;_&gt;&gt;</code> and <code>Arc&lt;RwLock&lt;_&gt;&gt;</code>. This will allow us to effectively clone the pager and
use it from multiple places without running into borrow checker issues.
At this stage of the project we could have chosen to use a simple <code>Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;_&gt;&gt;</code>,
but we'll eventually need to support concurrent access to the pager, so we'll
use thread-safe counterparts from the start.</p>
<pre><code>// src/pager.rs

<span>- #[derive(Debug, Clone)]</span>
<span>+ #[derive(Debug)]</span>
pub struct Pager&lt;I: Read + Seek = std::fs::File&gt; {
<span>-   input: I,</span>
<span>+   input: Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;I&gt;&gt;</span>
    page_size: usize,
<span>-   pages: HashMap&lt;usize, page::Page&gt;,</span>
<span>+   pages: Arc&lt;RwLock&lt;HashMap&lt;usize, Arc&lt;page::Page&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;,</span>
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>read_page</code> and <code>load_page</code> methods need to be updated accordingly:</p>
<pre><code><span>impl</span>&lt;I: Read + Seek&gt; Pager&lt;I&gt; {
    <span>// [...] </span>
    <span>pub</span> <span><span>fn</span> <span>read_page</span></span>(&amp;<span>self</span>, n: <span>usize</span>) -&gt; anyhow::<span>Result</span>&lt;Arc&lt;page::Page&gt;&gt; {
        {
            <span>let</span> read_pages = <span>self</span>
                .pages
                .read()
                .map_err(|_| anyhow!(<span>"failed to acquire pager read lock"</span>))?;

            <span>if</span> <span>let</span> <span>Some</span>(page) = read_pages.get(&amp;n) {
                <span>return</span> <span>Ok</span>(page.clone());
            }
        }

        <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> write_pages = <span>self</span>
            .pages
            .write()
            .map_err(|_| anyhow!(<span>"failed to acquire pager write lock"</span>))?;

        <span>if</span> <span>let</span> <span>Some</span>(page) = write_pages.get(&amp;n) {
            <span>return</span> <span>Ok</span>(page.clone());
        }

        <span>let</span> page = <span>self</span>.load_page(n)?;
        write_pages.insert(n, page.clone());
        <span>Ok</span>(page)
    }

    <span><span>fn</span> <span>load_page</span></span>(&amp;<span>self</span>, n: <span>usize</span>) -&gt; anyhow::<span>Result</span>&lt;Arc&lt;page::Page&gt;&gt; {
        <span>let</span> offset = n.saturating_sub(<span>1</span>) * <span>self</span>.page_size;

        <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> input_guard = <span>self</span>
            .input
            .lock()
            .map_err(|_| anyhow!(<span>"failed to lock pager mutex"</span>))?;

        input_guard
            .seek(SeekFrom::Start(offset <span>as</span> <span>u64</span>))
            .context(<span>"seek to page start"</span>)?;

        <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> buffer = <span>vec!</span>[<span>0</span>; <span>self</span>.page_size];
        input_guard.read_exact(&amp;<span>mut</span> buffer).context(<span>"read page"</span>)?;

        <span>Ok</span>(Arc::new(parse_page(&amp;buffer, n)?))
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Two things to note regarding the <code>read_page</code> method:</p>
<ul>
<li>the initial attempt to read the page from the cache is nested in a block to
limit the scope of the read lock, ensuring that it is released before we try
to acquire the write lock</li>
<li>after acquiring the write lock, we check again if the page is already in the
cache, in case it was inserted in between the two lock acquisitions</li>
</ul>
<p>Similarly, we'll define an owned version of our <code>Value</code> enum that we'll use
in the query evaluator:</p>
<pre><code><span>// src/value.rs</span>

<span>// [...]</span>

<span>#[derive(Debug, Clone)]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span><span>enum</span> <span>OwnedValue</span></span> {
    Null,
    <span>String</span>(Rc&lt;<span>String</span>&gt;),
    Blob(Rc&lt;<span>Vec</span>&lt;<span>u8</span>&gt;&gt;),
    Int(<span>i64</span>),
    Float(<span>f64</span>),
}

<span>impl</span>&lt;<span>'p</span>&gt; <span>From</span>&lt;Value&lt;<span>'p</span>&gt;&gt; <span>for</span> OwnedValue {
    <span><span>fn</span> <span>from</span></span>(value: Value&lt;<span>'p</span>&gt;) -&gt; <span>Self</span> {
        <span>match</span> value {
            Value::Null =&gt; Self::Null,
            Value::Int(i) =&gt; Self::Int(i),
            Value::Float(f) =&gt; Self::Float(f),
            Value::Blob(b) =&gt; Self::Blob(Rc::new(b.into_owned())),
            Value::<span>String</span>(s) =&gt; Self::<span>String</span>(Rc::new(s.into_owned())),
        }
    }
}

<span>impl</span> std::fmt::Display <span>for</span> OwnedValue {
    <span><span>fn</span> <span>fmt</span></span>(&amp;<span>self</span>, f: &amp;<span>mut</span> std::fmt::Formatter&lt;<span>'_</span>&gt;) -&gt; std::fmt::<span>Result</span> {
        <span>match</span> <span>self</span> {
            OwnedValue::Null =&gt; <span>write!</span>(f, <span>"null"</span>),
            OwnedValue::<span>String</span>(s) =&gt; s.fmt(f),
            OwnedValue::Blob(items) =&gt; {
                <span>write!</span>(
                    f,
                    <span>"{}"</span>,
                    items
                        .iter()
                        .filter_map(|&amp;n| <span>char</span>::from_u32(n <span>as</span> <span>u32</span>).filter(<span>char</span>::is_ascii))
                        .collect::&lt;<span>String</span>&gt;()
                )
            }
            OwnedValue::Int(i) =&gt; i.fmt(f),
            OwnedValue::Float(x) =&gt; x.fmt(f),
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, we'll enrich our <code>Cursor</code> struct with a method that returns the value
of a field as an <code>OwnedValue</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>// src/cursor.rs</span>

<span>impl</span> Cursor {
    <span>// [...] </span>
    <span>pub</span> <span><span>fn</span> <span>owned_field</span></span>(&amp;<span>self</span>, n: <span>usize</span>) -&gt; <span>Option</span>&lt;OwnedValue&gt; {
        <span>self</span>.field(n).map(<span>Into</span>::into)
    }
    <span>// [...]</span>
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="heading-evaluating-select-statements">Evaluating <code>SELECT</code> statements</h2>
<p>Our query engine will be composed of two main components:</p>
<ul>
<li>an iterator-like <code>Operator</code> enum that represents nestable operations on the
database, such as scanning a table or filtering rows. Our initial implementation
will only contain a <code>SeqScan</code> operator that yields all rows from a table.</li>
<li>a <code>Planner</code> struct that takes a parsed SQL query and produces an <code>Operator</code> that
can be evaluated to produce the query result.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's start by defining the <code>Operator</code> enum:</p>
<pre><code><span>// src/engine/operator.rs</span>
<span>use</span> anyhow::Context;

<span>use</span> crate::{cursor::Scanner, value::OwnedValue};

<span>#[derive(Debug)]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span><span>enum</span> <span>Operator</span></span> {
    SeqScan(SeqScan),
}

<span>impl</span> Operator {
    <span>pub</span> <span><span>fn</span> <span>next_row</span></span>(&amp;<span>mut</span> <span>self</span>) -&gt; anyhow::<span>Result</span>&lt;<span>Option</span>&lt;&amp;[OwnedValue]&gt;&gt; {
        <span>match</span> <span>self</span> {
            Operator::SeqScan(s) =&gt; s.next_row(),
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The result of evaluating a query will be obtained by repeatedly calling the
<code>next_row</code> method on the <code>Operator</code> until it returns <code>None</code>. Each value
in the returned slice corresponds to a column in the query result.</p>
<p>The <code>SeqScan</code> struct will be responsible for scanning a table and yielding
its rows:</p>
<pre><code><span>// src/engine/operator.rs</span>

<span>// [...]</span>

<span>#[derive(Debug)]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span><span>struct</span> <span>SeqScan</span></span> {
    fields: <span>Vec</span>&lt;<span>usize</span>&gt;,
    scanner: Scanner,
    row_buffer: <span>Vec</span>&lt;OwnedValue&gt;,
}

<span>impl</span> SeqScan {
    <span>pub</span> <span><span>fn</span> <span>new</span></span>(fields: <span>Vec</span>&lt;<span>usize</span>&gt;, scanner: Scanner) -&gt; <span>Self</span> {
        <span>let</span> row_buffer = <span>vec!</span>[OwnedValue::Null; fields.len()];

        <span>Self</span> {
            fields,
            scanner,
            row_buffer,
        }
    }

    <span><span>fn</span> <span>next_row</span></span>(&amp;<span>mut</span> <span>self</span>) -&gt; anyhow::<span>Result</span>&lt;<span>Option</span>&lt;&amp;[OwnedValue]&gt;&gt; {
        <span>let</span> <span>Some</span>(record) = <span>self</span>.scanner.next_record()? <span>else</span> {
            <span>return</span> <span>Ok</span>(<span>None</span>);
        };

        <span>for</span> (i, &amp;n) <span>in</span> <span>self</span>.fields.iter().enumerate() {
            <span>self</span>.row_buffer[i] = record.owned_field(n).context(<span>"missing record field"</span>)?;
        }

        <span>Ok</span>(<span>Some</span>(&amp;<span>self</span>.row_buffer))
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>SeqScan</code> struct is initialized with a list of field indices to read from
each record and a <code>Scanner</code> that will yield the records for every row in the
table to be scanned. As the number of fields to read is identical for every row,
we can preallocate a buffer to store the values of the selected fields.
The next_row method retrieves the next record from the scanner, extracts
the requested fields (specified by their indices), and stores them in our buffer.</p>
<p>Now that we have an <code>Operator</code> to evaluate <code>SELECT</code> statements, let's move on
to the <code>Planner</code> struct that will produce the <code>Operator</code> from a parsed SQL query:</p>
<pre><code><span>// src/engine/plan.rs</span>

<span>use</span> anyhow::{bail, Context, <span>Ok</span>};

<span>use</span> crate::{
    db::Db,
    sql::ast::{<span>self</span>, SelectFrom},
};

<p>The <code>Planner</code> struct is initialized with a reference to the database and
provides a <code>compile</code> method that takes a parsed SQL statement and returns
the corresponding <code>Operator</code>.
The <code>compile</code> method dispatches to a specific method for each type of SQL statement.</p>
<p>Let's see how to build an <code>Operator</code> for a <code>SELECT</code> statement:</p>
<pre><code>
<span>// src/engine/plan.rs</span>

<span>impl</span>&lt;<span>'d</span>&gt; Planner&lt;<span>'d</span>&gt; {
    <span>// [...] </span>

    <span><span>fn</span> <span>compile_select</span></span>(<span>self</span>, select: &amp;ast::SelectStatement) -&gt; anyhow::<span>Result</span>&lt;Operator&gt; {
        <span>let</span> SelectFrom::Table(table_name) = &amp;select.core.from;

        <span>let</span> table = <span>self</span>
            .db
            .tables_metadata
            .iter()
            .find(|m| &amp;m.name == table_name)
            .with_context(|| <span>format!</span>(<span>"invalid table name: {table_name}"</span>))?;

        <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> columns = <span>Vec</span>::new();

        <span>for</span> res_col <span>in</span> &amp;select.core.result_columns {
            <span>match</span> res_col {
                ast::ResultColumn::Star =&gt; {
                    <span>for</span> i <span>in</span> <span>0</span>..table.columns.len() {
                        columns.push(i);
                    }
                }
                ast::ResultColumn::Expr(e) =&gt; {
                    <span>let</span> ast::Expr::Column(col) = &amp;e.expr;
                    <span>let</span> (index, _) = table
                        .columns
                        .iter()
                        .enumerate()
                        .find(|(_, c)| c.name == col.name)
                        .with_context(|| <span>format!</span>(<span>"invalid column name: {}"</span>, col.name))?;
                    columns.push(index);
                }
            }
        }

        <span>Ok</span>(Operator::SeqScan(SeqScan::new(
            columns,
            <span>self</span>.db.scanner(table.first_page),
        )))
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>First, we find a table metadata entry that matches the table name in the <code>SELECT</code>
statement. Then we iterate over the statement's result columns and build a list of
field indices to read from each record, either by expanding <code>*</code> to all columns or
by looking up the column name in the table metadata.</p>
<p>Finally, we create a <code>SeqScan</code> operator that will scan the entire tabl and yield
the selected fields for each row.</p>
<h2 id="heading-query-evaluation-in-the-repl">Query evaluation in the REPL</h2>
<p>It's time to put our query evaluator to the test!
We'll create a simple function that reads a raw SQL query and evaluates it:</p>
<pre><code>
<span>// src/main.rs</span>

<span>// [...]</span>

<span><span>fn</span> <span>eval_query</span></span>(db: &amp;db::Db, query: &amp;<span>str</span>) -&gt; anyhow::<span>Result</span>&lt;()&gt; {
    <span>let</span> parsed_query = sql::parse_statement(query, <span>false</span>)?;
    <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> op = engine::plan::Planner::new(db).compile(&amp;parsed_query)?;

    <span>while</span> <span>let</span> <span>Some</span>(values) = op.next_row()? {
        <span>let</span> formated = values
            .iter()
            .map(<span>ToString</span>::to_string)
            .collect::&lt;<span>Vec</span>&lt;_&gt;&gt;()
            .join(<span>"|"</span>);

        <span>println!</span>(<span>"{formated}"</span>);
    }

    <span>Ok</span>(())
}
</code></pre>
<p>This function creates a pipeline: it parses the SQL query, builds an
<code>Operator</code> with our Planner, and then repeatedly calls next_row() on the resulting operator
to retrieve and display each row of the result.</p>
<p>The final step is to use this function in the REPL loop:</p>
<pre><code>// src/main.rs

// [...]

 fn cli(mut db: db::Db) -&gt; anyhow::Result&lt;()&gt; {
     print_flushed("rqlite&gt; ")?;

     let mut line_buffer = String::new();

     while stdin().lock().read_line(&amp;mut line_buffer).is_ok() {
         match line_buffer.trim() {
             ".exit" =&gt; break,
             ".tables" =&gt; display_tables(&amp;mut db)?,
<span>+            stmt =&gt; eval_query(&amp;db, stmt)?, </span>
<span>-            stmt =&gt; match sql::parse_statement(stmt, true) {</span>
<span>-                Ok(stmt) =&gt; {</span>
<span>-                    println!("{:?}", stmt);</span>
<span>-                }</span>
<span>-                Err(e) =&gt; {</span>
<span>-                    println!("Error: {}", e);</span>
<span>-                }</span>
<span>-            },</span>
         }

         print_flushed("\nrqlite&gt; ")?;

         line_buffer.clear();
     }

     Ok(())
 }
</code></pre>
<p>Now we can run the REPL and evaluate some simple <code>SELECT</code> statements:</p>
<pre><code>cargo run -- queries_test.db
rqlite&gt; select * from table1;
</code></pre>
<p>If everything went well, you should see the following output:</p>
<pre><code>1|11
2|12
3|13
</code></pre>
<h2 id="heading-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Our small database engine is starting to take shape! We can now parse and evaluate
simple <code>SELECT</code> queries. But there's still a lot to cover before we can call it
a fully functional database engine.
In the next posts, we'll discover how to filter rows, read indexes, and implement
sorting and grouping. </p>

Baker, our local ski resort. On a recent afternoon, however, the talk among the moms and dads as we kept half an eye on a hotly contested game of four-square swerved to a somewhat unusual topic—eggs.</p><div><p>Where was the best place to find them? Which brands were available? Were any stores completely out? Parents rattled off reports of what they had seen at various places, from the big box outlets to the local food co-op, from high-end Whole Foods to discounters like Grocery Outlet and WinCo. “And,” someone sighed, “Can you believe the prices?”&nbsp;I listened and nodded, secure in the knowledge that I had six fresh eggs, straight from the backyard, on my kitchen counter.</p><p>“When a few chickens get sick in a facility that has millions of other chickens, the whole flock gets wiped out. As a nation, we have too many eggs in one industrialized basket.”</p><p>Eggs are suddenly a conversation starter as the latest wave of highly pathogenic avian flu clobbers U.S. poultry farmers in the worst outbreak of the virus since 2022. In December, <a href="https://www.ams.usda.gov/mnreports/ams_3725.pdf"><u>some 13.2 million laying hens</u> </a>either succumbed to the disease or were culled as a result of the flu, dominated by the H5N1 subtype. In the first six weeks of this year, <a href="https://www.ams.usda.gov/mnreports/ams_3725.pdf">23.5 million</a> have already died. Altogether, <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/commercial-backyard-flocks">more than 159 million poultry livestock</a> in the U.S. have died due to the virus over the last three years.</p><p>So far, the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/inhumans.html">risks to humans remains low</a>. However, public health experts worry that the Center for Disease Control’s ability to release updates on the virus might be compromised. The agency recently found that <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7404a2.htm?s_cid=mm7404a2_w">the virus may be spreading undetected</a> in cows and in veterinarians who treat them—but that<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/02/13/cdc-bird-flu-spread/"><u> </u>study was omitted</a> from an agency report released this month, after the Trump administration’s <a href="https://www.science.org/do/10.1126/science.z7pm10i/full/actinghhssecretarymemoaction2212025-1737591296147.pdf">pause</a> on federal health-agency communications.</p><p>Meanwhile, in a repeat of the 2022 outbreak, the virus has once again led to a sharp price spike and sent restaurants and<a href="https://www.wfla.com/news/florida/florida-publix-stores-suffer-from-egg-shortages-due-to-bird-flu-outbreak/"> shoppers scrambling</a> for eggs. Social media is awash with reports of<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/donmoyn.bsky.social/post/3lhab4fstho2m"> bare grocery-store shelves</a>. Last week, the average price of a dozen eggs hit $4.95 per dozen—<a href="https://apnews.com/article/egg-prices-record-bird-flu-a2394bdefc7bd0514d4f003cc5e8a908">an all time-record</a>. The wholesale price restaurants pay is even higher, recently topping<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/egg-shortages-now-hitting-restaurants-130000854.html"> $7 a dozen</a>. Waffle House recently announced that it was placing<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/04/food/waffle-house-egg-surcharge/index.html"> a 50-cent surcharge</a> on every egg it cooks.</p><p>The virus’s impacts on the poultry industry—and, to a lesser extent, on <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/02/13/cdc-bird-flu-spread/">dairy production</a>—may well be the biggest interruption to the U.S. food system since the COVID-19 quarantine, which created a rush on vegetable seeds and baby chicks.</p><p>Such shocks to the food system are evidence of some of the inherent weaknesses of an industrialized and highly concentrated agriculture sector.<a href="https://www.eggindustry-digital.com/eggindustry/library/item/january_2024/4160291/"> Just 20 firms raise more than two-thirds</a> of the roughly 380 million laying hens in America. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/opinion/food-agriculture-factory-farms-climate-change.html">To some people</a>, such concentration is an asset, proof of the impressive productivity of modern agriculture.

Most people first heard the term “avian flu” back in 1997, when <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/avian-timeline/1960-1999.html">a </a><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/avian-timeline/1960-1999.html">spillover event </a><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/avian-timeline/1960-1999.html">in Hong Kong</a> led to six human deaths.&nbsp;Since then, human cases have been exceedingly, thankfully rare. But in the intervening decades the once-novel virus has become widespread among wild fowl. It has jumped to other animals, including domesticated cows and wild marine mammals like seals and sea lions. And it has infected humans, though the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/inhumans.html">risk to the public is minimal,</a>&nbsp;at least for now.</p><div><p>The virus can spread by direct contact, as well as through the air, which makes it highly contagious. Biologists estimate that in recent years<a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240425-how-dangerous-is-bird-flu-spread-to-wildlife-and-humans"> millions of wild birds</a> have died from the virus. The disease has been especially hard on waterfowl like geese and ducks, though few bird species have been spared. Bird flu has caused<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/interactive/2024/bald-eagle-avian-flu-death/"> deaths of bald eagles</a>, especially chicks before they fledge. An outbreak among the <a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/can-california-condors-survive-avian-flu">endangered California condors</a> has set back efforts to recover that species.</p><p>“What we do know is that the virus is now endemic in some wild birds, like wild ducks that move through our country,” says Carol Cardona, a professor of veterinary and biomedical sciences at University of Minnesota. “We know that is partially why we keep getting these seasonal outbreaks.”</p></div></section><section><div><p>Every year, tens of millions of migratory birds travel from the northern latitudes southward, and they inevitably cross paths with domesticated flocks. During a recent briefing for reporters, Maurice Pitesky, a cooperative extension agent at the University of California, Davis used California as an example.</p><p>“During the winter . . . we go from 600,000 resident waterfowl to over 8 million waterfowl. You will see ducks and geese. And we’ve decided to have our poultry and dairy operations overlap with where the wildfowl over-winter. They spatially overlap, and that is where infection can take place.”</p><p>After years of repeated bird flu outbreaks, most industrialized poultry operations have implemented sophisticated biosecurity protocols to try to keep their flocks safe. The birds spend the entirety of their lives indoors, quarantined from direct contact with wild fowl. No visitors are allowed on site, and at some facilities staff are even required to shower on the way in and the way out of the barns where the birds live.</p><p>So, how is it possible for the virus to get into a high-tech barn? Simple: the birds still need to breathe, which requires a ventilation system of some kind, which allows an entry point for the virus. Phillip Clauer, a professor emeritus of poultry science at Penn State, explains: “In the Midwest, they are working the fields in the fall, and you’ll see dust coming up from the fields, and the geese will land there to glean the extra corn, and they crap in the field. The dust goes aerosol, and that dust travels a long distance. We had one infected layer house in Pennsylvania, and they could tell you exactly what air vent the virus came in from. And then it spread through the whole flock.”</p><p>What does that mean for pasture-raised poultry, which spend most of their lives outdoors and therefore are at greater risk of contact with contagious wild birds? Farmers involved in smaller scale and regenerative poultry production insist that pastured birds are less susceptible to the virus, thanks to overall better health and wellbeing.</p><p>“In general, birds raised in high-welfare systems with access to pasture and sunlight are healthier and more resilient than birds raised in confinement,” says Tim Holmes, the director of compliance at<a href="https://agreenerworld.org/certifications/"> A Greener World</a>, which oversees the Certified Regenerative and Animal Welfare Approved labels. “In a pasture-based system, the key is having enough space and sunlight for the birds so that the pathogen load does not become too great. The ability [of] birds to forage and express natural behaviors also helps reduce stress, so the bird has a healthier immune system.”</p><p>I heard a similar argument when I paid a visit to David Whittaker at<a href="https://www.oakmeadowsfarmllc.com/"> Oak Meadows Farm</a>, a pasture-raised poultry and hog operation near where I live in Whatcom County, WA. Whittaker maintains his own biosecurity protocols—he wouldn’t let me enter the barn where about 100 chickens of his breeder flock were clucking around—but his chickens spend most of their lives freely roaming outside, with an epic view of glacier-capped Mount Baker.</p><p>Whittaker raises about 6,000 broiler chickens annually on 10 acres, and he has flocks on pasture well into October and November, when tens of thousands of snow geese, trumpeter swans, tundra swans, and ducks of all kinds fly overhead. In the 10 years since he turned his childhood hobby into a commercial operation, he’s never had a bird infected by the virus. “The birds I raise are healthier; they’ve got more resistance to it,” Whittaker says.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://civileats.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/250214-backyard-birds-David-Whittaker-and-his-breeding-flock-photo-by-Jason-Mark.jpg" rel="lightbox"><img decoding="async" src="https://civileats.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/250214-backyard-birds-David-Whittaker-and-his-breeding-flock-photo-by-Jason-Mark.jpg" alt="David-Whittaker and his breeding flock."></a></p><p>David Whittaker and his breeding flock. (Photo credit: Jason Mark)</p></div><div><p>How come, exactly? “Just because I’m using high-quality feed, I’m not packing 100,000 or more into a building. They are out on pasture, eating grass.”</p><p>Clauer—who made a point to tell me that he has worked with both pastured operations and industrial players—was skeptical of the idea that pasture-raised birds might be less susceptible to the virus. “The more birds you have spread all over creation, the more opportunities you have to interface with wild waterfowl.”</p><p>He was also leery of the notion that smaller farms could meet the country’s demands for chicken breasts, turkey dinners, and egg scrambles. “You would need so many small flocks that you couldn’t produce enough eggs. You wouldn’t have enough people to collect the eggs.”</p></div></section><section><div><p>But Clauer didn’t dispute that the high concentrations of birds in industrial facilities (the biggest one he knows of is a 4-million-bird operation in Iowa) come with the risk of high mortality numbers, as well as greater chances of the virus mutating. “If you have a lot of animals, a lot more birds can become infected a lot more quickly. The bigger the flock, the bigger the concern.”</p><p>I have to wonder if some of the risk-reward calculus between industrial poultry farms and smaller, pasture-raised ones might start to change if—or <em>when</em>—bird flu becomes endemic in domesticated flocks. Especially now that the virus is going back and forth between cattle and birds, containment may no longer be an option. All the biosecurity measures in the world won’t stop geese from crapping in farm fields. It’s like wearing a hazmat suit to keep away the common cold.</p><p>If that’s so, then the way to create a more resilient—which is to say, a more <em>efficient</em>—food system would be to have more poultry farms like Whittaker’s. Of course, the economics of small-scale livestock farming are punishingly difficult and it would require a sweeping overhaul of the food system to get more locally raised eggs from pasture to market.</p><p>For that reason alone, we’re unlikely to see a flowering of more thousand-bird flocks any time soon. But there is another route to diversifying egg production from healthy, resilient birds: the kind of backyard flock like mine. “Basically, every couple of families [could have] enough hens to supply their friends and family,” Whittaker says. “Even if a small farm goes out, it wouldn’t matter. That would be the ultimate dream—pretty much everybody produc[ing] their own eggs, if they have the space to.”</p><h4><strong>Should You Raise Chickens?<br> </strong></h4></div><p>Far from being a problem, then, backyard birds offer something of a solution. And, perhaps unsurprisingly, this latest avian flu–driven price shock <a href="https://abc7.com/post/soaring-egg-prices-are-piquing-interest-backyard-chickens-amid-bird-flu-outbreak/15864215/">has reignited interest in backyard flocks</a>. Even if the virus were to disappear tomorrow, retail egg prices will be well above normal for another 12 to 18 months. It will take at least that long for commercial breeding flocks to recover. So this may be the good time to invest in a backyard flock.</p><div><p>If you’re serious about joining the estimated<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10812673/"> 13 percent of U.S. households that keep backyard chickens</a>, here are some things to keep in mind.</p><p>“Every couple of families [could have] enough hens to supply their friends and family. Even if a small farm goes out, it wouldn’t matter.”</p><p>Given all the news about bird flu, you’re no doubt wondering whether backyard poultry could put you or your household at serious risk. <em>At this point</em>, the answer is no. Most of the 67 human cases of bird flu in the United States have resulted from people catching the virus from dairy cattle, and most of them have been mild cases. The one human fatality from bird flu took place in Louisiana, where a woman apparently contracted it from dead chickens,<a href="https://apnews.com/article/bird-flu-death-louisiana-82e4d00876e62cb2b13bb621826c84f9"> but according to all reports</a> the person was elderly and in poor health.</p><p>The risk is low, but it isn’t zero, and contact with backyard chickens would put you at a higher exposure. There are, though, ways to mitigate the danger. Clauer says one of the most important strategies for keeping your backyard flock—and you—healthy is to keep them away from wild birds. This can be as simple as ensuring that their living space is secured from feathered visitors by, for example, putting a net above the coop and run.</p><p>Beyond that, you’d want to follow some basic biosecurity protocols (the<a href="https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/avian-influenza-protect-birds-qa.pdf"> USDA</a> and<a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/news/uc-davis-veterinarians-offer-tips-preventing-bird-flu-backyard-chickens"> UC Davis</a> have some good cheat sheets). Keep an extra pair of “coop boots” that you use only for going in and out of the poultry enclosure, so you’re not tracking poop into your house. Secure the birds’ food and water to keep out other critters, like rodents, that can carry disease. And always, always wash your hands after collecting eggs and feeding and watering your hens—an instruction so simple that even young children can follow it.</p><p>The next big question is: Are you ready to make the commitment of time and attention? Chickens require a level of care not dissimilar to any other animal companion. They need fresh water and food daily, plus regular cleanings of their coop and runs. They also—and this is harder than it sounds—need to be kept safe from predators.</p><p>If you’ve only ever cared for a house plant, you may want to think twice. That said, there are plenty of how-to guides to help you learn the basics, from the encyclopedic<a href="https://www.chelseagreen.com/product/the-small-scale-poultry-flock-revised-edition/?srsltid=AfmBOoo4FdhpoJ1X4OyOVdQoh_uRXF0gzUKQVWQa3foxXnFwLIeGUD-7"> <em>The Small-Scale Poultry Flock</em></a> to the more quick and dirty tips in<a href="https://www.powells.com/book/the-essential-urban-farmer-9780143118718?srsltid=AfmBOoqjcbPf0HOftnnZm1MrUki3kiJ0dVTkU8aJOC6Sa6fOcY6aJ1Iu"> <em>The Essential Urban Farmer</em></a>. Maurice Pitesky and his colleagues at U.C. Davis also have<a href="https://ucanr.edu/sites/poultry/type/backyard/"> a useful library of fact sheets</a>.</p><p>Next, you need to ensure that it’s legally permissible to keep poultry in your city, town, or county. Most areas allow backyard poultry raising, but you need to be aware of the idiosyncrasies of local ordinances. Some places have strict rules about setbacks from neighbors’ properties, and many others prohibit roosters (too noisy). You can find a useful guide to local poultry rules at<a href="https://www.backyardchickens.com/articles/categories/chicken-laws-ordinances.13/"> backyardchickens.com</a>. Also: Be sure to check in with your neighbors before hatching your plans, to avoid drama.</p></div></section><div><p>Finally, ask yourself if it’s financially worth it to you.<a href="https://www.lowes.com/pl/livestock-supplies/chicken-coops-rabbit-hutches/4294610501?cm_mmc=src-_-c-_-prd-_-sol-_-ggl-_-CRP_SRC_Non-Brand_SOL_Online_Patio_BROAD-_-pre%252520assembled%252520chicken%252520coop-_-0-_-0-_-0&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAtYy9BhBcEiwANWQQL-gmT_0l-HwBrl_gLZ1HUl1_0dLPk_CaWR6kU5njr06RvYblTe3oWBoC5dUQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds"> An off-the-shelf chicken coop</a> can easily cost $300—and well more if you go for a bespoke model. If you’re handy, you can build one yourself, but lumber ain’t cheap, and even a homemade coop will pinch your pocketbook. You’ll also need some waterers, and maybe even a heated model if, like me, you live in a place with icy winters. If you’re rearing day-old chicks (which run anywhere from $5 to $15 per bird or more), you’ll need a heat lamp system and the proper feeders. Keep in mind that if you do purchase day-old chicks this spring, you won’t get your first eggs for about 20 weeks.</p><p>In short, there’s no such thing as a free egg. If you’re launching a laying hen setup from scratch, the payoff horizon may be longer than you wish. But if bird flu does become a permanent challenge for the U.S. poultry industry, the investment will eventually be worth it. “That might not be a bad economic equation for the next two years,” Clauer figures.</p><p>I’ve kept chickens for a total of six years in two different states, and by now I’ve paid off my initial investments and ongoing feed costs. During the summer, we’re overflowing with eggs, and routinely give away a half dozen here and a dozen there to friends, family, and neighbors. The egg volume does decline in the winter, yet even without artificial light we manage to get one or two eggs a day up here at the 49th parallel.</p><p>But I would keep backyard chickens even if it were a break-even proposition. I don’t raise hens simply as a matter of grocery-bill savings. They provide me with a subjective, but very real, sense of abundance and security.</p><p>I keep a large home garden, big enough to produce well more than half of my family’s annual fruits and vegetables. But, being a flexitarian, I can’t live on kale alone. And even though I can’t live off kale frittatas alone either, by producing some of my own protein I cultivate a feeling of ecological resilience, knowing that I’m more insulated from the brittleness—and the injustices and the pollution—of industrialized agriculture.</p><p>My small flock represents one additional node in the food production network. Imagine many more nodes like that, hundreds of thousands of new backyard flocks, and you might come to see how every home-scale hen helps strengthen the food system.</p><p>I’m convinced that even with all the cost and labor and time, such resilience and abundance is worth the price tag—is in fact, priceless.</p><p><em>An earlier edition of this article misspelled the name of Tim Holmes, the director of compliance at<a href="https://agreenerworld.org/certifications/"> A Greener World</a>.</em></p></div><div id="post-fundraising"><h3>You’d be a great Civil Eats member…</h3><p>Civil Eats is a reader-supported, nonprofit newsroom, and we count on our members to keep producing our award-winning work.</p><p><strong>Readers like you are the reason why we’re able to keep digging deep into stories you won’t find anywhere else.</strong> When you <a href="https://civileats.com/about/become-a-member/"><strong>become a member</strong></a>, your support directly funds our journalism—from paying our reporters to keeping the internet on in our remote offices across the United States.</p><p>Your membership will also come with great benefits, including our award-winning newsletter, The Deep Dish, which is full of relevant and timely reporting, access to our members’ Slack community, and online salons as a way to engage with reporters, food and agriculture experts, and each other.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://civileats.com/author/jmark/"><img data-del="avatar" src="https://civileats.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/JMark-150x150.jpg" height="96" width="96"></a></p><p>Jason Mark, a former urban farmer and the co-founder of San Francisco's Alemany Farm, is an environmental journalist based in Bellingham, WA.

The province is on track to have at least 1.6 gigawatts of data centers at any given moment from nearly nothing in 2019, making it the fastest-growing data center market in Southeast Asia, <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://20189129.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/20189129/GLOBAL%20DATA%20CENTER%20INDEX_2024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to a report published in April</a></span>. </p>
    

<p>Data centers are large, windowless buildings filled with racks of computers that need lots of electricity. To prevent overheating, they rely on energy-intensive air conditioning systems using pumped water. Increasingly used by tech companies for running artificial intelligence systems, the power demand from future facilities in Malaysia may rise to over 5 gigawatts by 2035, <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.kenanga.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/TENAGA-240830-2Q24-RN-Kenanga.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to researchers at Malaysia’s Kenanga Investment Bank.</a></span> This is more than half of Malaysia’s entire renewable capacity in 2023. </p>

<p>Over 95% of the energy available to Malaysia in 2022 was from fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency. The country is now fifth-largest exporter of liquefied natural gas globally. And with planned renewable projects, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.pmo.gov.my/2024/09/text-speech-by-prime-minister-keynote-address-invest-malaysia-iskandar-2024-where-policy-meets-progress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said in September</a></span> that the country was “confident of a surplus of energy” to fuel large projects and keep exporting.</p><p>But Lau doesn’t fancy the chances of his homegrown business competing against the foreign-funded behemoths for energy. Even without data centers, Malaysia is susceptible to power interruptions because of storms, including one that lasted 30 minutes last year and killed 300,000 fish, costing Lau over $1 million. He worries that data centers would result in longer outages. </p><p>To survive, he is moving to Thailand and already scouting potential locations for a new fish farm. </p><p>“Big data center is coming and there is shortage of power,” he said. “It’ll be crazy.” </p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

                </div><h2>Costs versus benefits</h2><p>Malaysia is betting that potential economic growth from data centers justifies the risk. Once touted as an Asian tiger on the cusp of becoming rich, its industries shrunk in the late 1990s after the <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/thailand-business-international-news-asia-pacific-asia-e57892c505b34f7cb2a016db6b3bc148">Asian financial crisis</a></span>. It has since languished in the middle-income trap. Data centers, the government hopes, will modernize its economy and indirectly create thousands of high-paying jobs.</p><p>But experts worry that Malaysia, and others like Vietnam, Indonesia and India vying for billion-dollar investments from tech giants, may be overstating data centers’ transformative capabilities that also come at a price: Data centers gobble up land, water and electricity while creating far fewer jobs than they promise. Most data centers provide 30 to 50 permanent jobs while the larger ones create 200 jobs at most, according to a report by the <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://goodjobsfirst.org/wp-content/uploads/docs/pdf/datacenters.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American nonprofit Good Jobs First</a></span>. </p>
    

<p>Add to this the rapid increase in power and water use and some experts like Sofia Scasserra, who researches digital economies at the Amsterdam-based think tank Transnational Institute, said that tech companies exploiting resources in poorer countries while extracting data from their populations to get rich is akin to “digital colonialism.” She compared data extraction to silver mining in Bolivia, which enriched colonial Spain but left nothing behind for Latin America.</p><p>“They are extracting data in the same way. Data doesn’t even leave (behind) taxes,” she said. </p><p>Indeed, only a small portion of Malaysia’s data center capacity is actually for Malaysian users. Through a network of submarine cables that fans out into the world, they service East Asia, China and Europe. And the data centers themselves are run by foreign companies like America’s Equinix and Microsoft as well as Chinese competitor GDS Holdings that works with tech giants like Alibaba. </p><p>These data centers are also on the front lines of AI competition between the U.S. and China. Shortly before he left office, U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-ai-artificial-intelligence-chips-computer-trade-4495b5b4a48e856dc612e7abe3e47d20">proposed new rules</a></span> that would limit exports of advanced AI chips made by U.S. companies like Nvidia, part of a strategy to deprive China and other U.S. adversaries from gaining access to AI technology through data centers in places likes Southeast Asia and the Middle East. Although it’s unclear if the Trump administration will retain the policy, which hasn’t yet taken effect, GDS Holdings saw its stock drop more than 18% on the day of the announcement. </p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

Data centers larger than 40 megawatt typically need land the size of seven football fields — about enough power for 36,000 American homes, according to data center service provider <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.streamdatacenters.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/SDC-Brief-Landowners-240112.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stream Data Centers</a></span>. </p><p>That’s costly to build in <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/data-centers-artificial-intelligence-technology-amazon-google-56b84cbb94942039754282afb076a87b">rich nations like the U.S.</a></span>, which over time has built more data centers than any other country but where land comes at a high price. Enter Malaysia, with its inexpensive land, excess power capacity and tax incentives. The country was the fastest growing data center market in Asia Pacific in the first half of 2024, according to <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.cushmanwakefield.com/en/singapore/news/2024/09/malaysia-the-fastest-growing-data-centre-market-in-asia-pacific" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global real estate firm Cushman and Wakefield.</a></span> This makes Malaysia the eighth-largest data center market in terms of operations and the fifth-largest behind China, India, Japan and Australia when accounting for projects already in the pipeline. </p>
    

<p>Globally Malaysia ranks 14th in terms of operational capacity — still smaller than Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam, Paris and Dublin — but it is on track to be among the top 10 markets in five to seven years, according to Pritesh Swamy, who heads research on data centers in Asia for the real estate firm Cushman &amp; Wakefield.</p><p>“We are talking about a region that really grew at a pace that nowhere in the world has seen,” Salgame said.</p><div data-align-center="">

The moratorium was over concerns that the energy-guzzling infrastructure was straining the tiny country’s limited resources. In 2019, data centers consumed 7% of the total electricity in the city-state that imports both power and water while aiming to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. They have been trying to build data centers sustainably since 2022, when the moratorium ended. </p><p>In the meantime, Malaysia has stepped in to fill the void, attracting investments of over $31 billion — three times the investments for 2023 — in the first 10 months of 2024, according to <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.knightfrank.be/research/malaysia-data-centre-research-report-2024-11793.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research</a></span> by real estate firm Knight Frank. Johor already has 22 mostly foreign data centers spanning over 21 hectares, according to the research firm <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://baxtel.com/data-center/johor#sites" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Baxtel</a></span>. That’s the equivalent of nearly 40 football fields, although not all of the data centers are operational. </p>
    

<h2>Concerns over power and water shortages</h2><p>The data centers that are running look anonymous from the outside. But they can be identified by the tell-tale signs of barbed wire fences, CCTV cameras and patrolling security guards. Elsewhere, a thicket of cranes and workers operating construction machinery is transforming the landscape in the sleepy province. </p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

What do I even mean with "semantic paragraphs?"</p> <p>Let me explain. Up until now, Typst considered <em>every</em> piece of text you wrote as a paragraph — be it a single word in a page header, a figure caption, or a page number. Just like paragraphs, these things can have spacing, break across lines, etc. Layout-wise they are not all that different from paragraphs.</p> <p>However, there <em>are</em> semantical differences. Only proper paragraphs should be counted when paragraphs are numbered (such as in legal texts). Only proper paragraphs should be announced by a screen reader as such. And even layout-wise there are differences; for instance, that only proper paragraphs should have first-line indent. While the layout routines for "just text" and a paragraph may be very similar, the second order effects of something being a proper paragraph are far-reaching.</p> <p>In version 0.13, Typst finally gains a better understanding of this distinction. Whether something is a paragraph or just text is decided based on a few simple rules about which you can read in the <a href="https://typst.app/docs/reference/model/par/#what-becomes-a-paragraph">updated paragraph documentation</a>.</p> <p>The most visible immediate effect of this work is that <a href="https://typst.app/docs/reference/model/par/#parameters-first-line-indent"><code>first-line-indent</code></a> can now be applied to all paragraphs instead of just consecutive ones, closing the most upvoted Typst bug. Semantic paragraphs are also crucial for the in-development HTML export and for planned future work on PDF accessibility.</p> <div><pre><code><span>#</span><span>set</span> <span>block</span><span>(</span>spacing<span>:</span> <span>1.2em</span><span>)</span>

The default style had no indentation and rather tightly dotted leaders (leaders are the filler dots between a title and its page number).</p> <p>In Typst 0.13, the outline gets a full facelift while also becoming easier to customize.

However, the input format of this function was rather arcane. Rather than specifying pen movements as in an SVG, you had to specify directly points with their two control points. Moreover, the path function had a fatal flaw: You could not close a path and then keep on drawing. This is necessary to draw a shape with cutouts, as depicated below.</p> <p>The new <a href="https://typst.app/docs/reference/visualize/curve/" title="`curve`"><code>curve</code></a> function fixes these flaws. It provides an easier-to-understand and more expressive interface. We also used this opportunity to change the name from <code>path</code> to <code>curve</code> as we plan to repurpose the name <code>path</code> for a file path type in an upcoming release.</p> <div><pre><code><span>#</span><span>curve</span><span>(</span>

Sometimes though, a little extra flexibility is needed, for example, to preprocess, generate, or inline data into a Typst document.</p> <p>For this reason, there are also <code>.decode</code> variants on various of the functions, e.g. <code>image.decode</code> or <code>json.decode</code>. However, that approach didn't work so well when a path is expected in a set rule, as in <code><span>set</span> <span>raw</span><span>(</span>theme<span>:</span> <span>"light.tmTheme"</span><span>)</span></code>. It also introduced duplication: All the properties of an image are also spelled out again in <code>image.decode</code>.</p> <p>Typst 0.13 revamps file handling to improve this unsatisfactory situation. All places where a path is expected now also support raw <a href="https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/bytes/" title="bytes">bytes</a> instead. Typst will always interpret a string as a path and raw bytes as data. When trying to decode an image from a string, thus make sure to first convert it to bytes. Converting to bytes is cheap as Typst will internally reuse the memory from the string. It will even remember that the bytes came from a string to make conversions back to a string cheap as well!</p> <p>The existing <code>.decode</code> functions are now deprecated as they are not needed anymore. The <code>.encode</code> variants of data loading functions remain unchanged.</p> <div><pre><code>See <span>@netwok</span> for details.

However, the image function expects images in an encoded image exchange format like PNG or JPEG. Producing valid bytes for such a format in pure Typst code is prohibitively complicated. Meanwhile, plugins are unnecessarily bloated and slowed down if they have to include an image encoder.</p> <p>To streamline image generation workflows, Typst 0.13 thus brings support for loading images from uncompressed raw pixel data. To that end, the <a href="https://typst.app/docs/reference/visualize/image/#parameters-format"><code>format</code></a> parameter of the image function supports a new form, where the channel encoding and pixel width/height of the image can be specified. This feature is crucial for better scientific visualizations — think things like heatmaps.</p> <div><pre><code><span>#</span><span>image</span><span>(</span>

Since then, plugins have become the backbone of various community packages. They're great because they bring the power and package ecosystem of all the languages that compile to WebAssembly right into Typst.</p> <p>They are also faster to execute than Typst code. Still, with heavy usage the time spent executing plugin code can make up a significant chunk of compile time. A simple way to improve this would've been to switch to a faster WebAssembly runtime (specifically, from <code>wasmi</code> to <code>wasmtime</code>). However, taking on a dependency on a WebAssembly runtime with just-in-time compilation<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> wasn't a spot we wanted to put Typst into. It would have reduced portability and security and increased the amount of third-party code Typst depends on by a lot.</p> <p>There was another way to speed up plugins: Since 0.12, Typst's layout engine is multi-threaded. Plugins didn't profit from this though as they couldn't be easily replicated across threads. This is a limitation we're lifting with 0.13. Typst will now automatically run plugins in multiple threads without any changes from plugin authors. This is possible because we require (and also already required in the past) plugin functions to be <em>pure.</em> This means that we can execute plugin functions out of order without a visible effect. For cases where purity is too limiting, Typst 0.13 introduces the new <a href="https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/plugin/#definitions-transition"><code>plugin.transition</code> API</a>, which lets plugin authors deal with stateful operations in a sound way.</p> <p>The work on speeding up plugins was prioritized through a Typst open-source support contract. If you're using Typst in production at your company and are hitting any road blocks, <a href="https://typst.app/pricing/?oss-support#oss">please reach out to us!</a></p> <h2 id="single-letter-strings-in-math">Single-letter strings in math</h2> <p>Since Typst's initial release, <code><span>$</span> <span>"hi"</span> <span>$</span></code> would generate the letters "h" and "i" in upright style while <code><span>$</span> <span>"h"</span> <span>$</span></code> would result in an italic "h". It's one of the <a href="https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/274">longest-standing bugs</a>, which is curious because it <em>seems</em> so easy to fix. Unfortunately, it was not. To see why, we need to take a look behind the scenes and understand how Typst views your equations.</p> <p>In Typst 0.12 and lower, the <code>x</code> in <code><span>$</span> x <span>$</span></code> is a <a href="https://typst.app/docs/reference/text/text/" title="text">text</a> element like any other text in your document. A string like <code><span>"hi"</span></code> is converted to content by becoming such a text element, too. While different syntactically, <code><span>$</span> x <span>$</span></code> and <code><span>$</span> <span>"x"</span> <span>$</span></code> thus used to yield identical content. Since <code>x</code> becomes italic by default, <code><span>"x"</span></code> did, too.</p> <p>Changing that by itself wouldn't have been too hard, but there is a third guest to the party: Symbols. The <code>pi</code> in <code><span>$</span> <span>pi</span> <span>$</span></code> is a <a href="https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/symbol/">symbol value</a>. Like strings, symbols were up until now converted to content by becoming text elements. This means they work both in math and normal text (as <code><span>#</span><span>sym</span><span>.</span><span>pi</span></code>).</p> <p>For a long time, the issue was thus blocked on finding a general solution to the text element ambiguity — <a href="https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/1125">perhaps introducing a new <code>var</code> element for math-y text</a>. That story isn't fully written yet, but for 0.13 we really wanted to fix the issue at hand. For this reason, we attempted to find a minimal solution that fixes the issue while leaving our options for further improvements open.</p> <p>The solution we came up with: Bare letters and symbols are now converted into an internal <em>symbol element,</em> which has auto-italics in math, but is transparently converted to normal text outside of math. Meanwhile, strings still generate text elements. With the <a href="https://laurmaedje.github.io/posts/types-and-context/">planned unification of types and elements</a>, this symbol element and the existing symbol type will naturally merge into one.</p> <div><pre><code><span>$</span> a <span>!=</span> <span>"a"</span> <span>$</span>

For example, Latin and Chinese text are almost always typeset with different fonts.</p> <p>This is quite problematic for CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) Typst users which often have text that mix their native language and English. Typst 0.13 takes a first step to improve this situation. With the new <a href="https://typst.app/docs/reference/text/text/#parameters-font"><code>covers</code></a> functionality, users can specify precisely for which character ranges a font should be used. This can, for example, be used to define in which font punctuation (which is present in both Latin and CJK fonts) is rendered.</p> <p>The <code>covers</code> feature supports specifying a character set, either as a <a href="https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/regex/">regular expression</a> or one of the built-in ones. Currently, the only built-in set is <code><span>"latin-in-cjk"</span></code>, which should be specified for a Latin font that is <em>before</em> a CJK font in the fallback list. In the example below, we can put <em>Inria Serif</em> first in the fallback chain while still having quotes render with <em>Noto Serif CJK SC.</em></p> <div><pre><code><span>// Mix Latin and CJK fonts.</span>

These embedded files can then be browsed in PDF viewers or extracted programmatically by third-party tools.</p> <p>When is this useful? One example, electronic invoicing, is ever more important as new EU legislation just came into force. While electronic invoices are typically in XML-based formats, it's often useful to still have a human-readable and printable invoice.</p> <p>With PDF file embedding, the XML invoice data can be inserted into the PDF itself, forming a hybrid invoice. Currently, there is still one missing piece in Typst's support for this: The PDF metadata must identify the document as an E-Invoice to other applications.

</span></pre> <p>The <code>target</code> function is contextual because the export target can vary within one compilation. How? With the <a href="https://typst.app/docs/reference/html/frame/" title="`html.frame`"><code>html.frame</code></a> function, you can lay out part of your HTML document as an inline SVG, using Typst's normal layout engine. Within such a frame, the compilation target is <code><span>"paged"</span></code> again, so that show rules produce the appropriate layout elements instead of HTML elements.</p> <h3 id="what-s-missing">What's missing</h3> <p>A lot! For instance, currently, Typst will always output a single HTML file. Support for outputting directories with multiple HTML documents and assets, as well as support for outputting fragments that can be integrated into other HTML documents is planned.</p> <p>Typst currently also doesn't output any CSS, instead focusing fully on emitting semantic markup. You can of course write your own CSS styles and still benefit from sharing your content between PDF and HTML.</p> <p>In the future, we plan to give you the option of automatically emitting CSS, taking more of your existing set rules into account. More generally, we have a lot of plans for HTML export! Visit the <a href="https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/5512">tracking issue</a> to learn more about them.</p> <h3 id="try-it">Try it!</h3> <p>In the CLI, you can experiment with HTML export by passing <code>--features html</code> or setting the <code>TYPST_FEATURES</code> environment variable to <code>html</code>. In the web app, HTML export is not yet available. It will become available once we think it's ready for general use.</p> <p>You can also use HTML export with <code>typst watch</code>. Typst will then automatically spin up a live-reloading HTTP server that serves your document.</p> <pre><span>$</span><span> typst watch hi.typ --features html --format html --open

</span></pre>  <p>Work on Typst's HTML export is sponsored by <a href="https://nlnet.nl/project/Typst-HTML/">NLNet</a>. We are very grateful for their support! We also want to thank external contributor <a href="https://github.com/01mf02">@01mf02</a> with whom we've thus far collaborated on HTML export through the NLNet grant. Unfortunately, we and him have since parted ways over technical differences. Nonetheless, we plan to increase the time and resources we put into HTML export, and we are very happy to have NLNet's continued support in this endeavor.</p> <h2 id="migrating">Migrating to Typst 0.13</h2> <p>Typst 0.13 ships with a number of deprecations and breaking changes. The <a href="https://typst.app/docs/changelog/0.13.0/">changelog</a> has a full account of all changes, but in this section you'll learn how to deal with the most common kinds of breakage.</p> <h3 id="type-string-compatibility">Type/string compatibility</h3> <p>In Typst 0.8, <a href="https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/type/">types</a> were promoted to proper values. As a result, <code><span>type</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>)</span></code> directly returns a type instead of a string since then. To make this change less disruptive, we also introduced a temporary compatibility behavior where types could be used like strings in some contexts (e.g., <code>int <span>==</span> <span>"integer"</span></code> would be true). For implementation reasons, we did not add a warning for this at the time. We're rectifying this now and adding a warning to shake out remaining reliance on this behavior. With Typst 0.14, the compatibility behavior will be fully removed.</p> <pre><code><span>// Typst 0.8+ ✅</span>

</code></pre> <h3 id="outline-migration">Outline</h3> <p>The changes to the built-in <a href="https://typst.app/docs/reference/model/outline/" title="outline">outline</a> (table of contents) improve the out-of-the-box style and customizability. Unfortunately, they also break some existing outline customizations.</p> <p>First of all, the <code>fill</code> argument moved from <code>outline</code> to <a href="https://typst.app/docs/reference/model/outline/#definitions-entry" title="`outline.entry`"><code>outline.entry</code></a>. If you get the error "unexpected argument: fill", adjust your code as shown below:</p> <pre><code><span>// Typst 0.13+ ✅</span>

<span>#</span><span>set</span> <span>outline</span><span>(</span>fill<span>:</span> <span>none</span><span>)</span>

</code></pre> <p>In light of the changes to paragraphs, outline entries now show themselves as <a href="https://typst.app/docs/reference/layout/block/">blocks</a> instead of lines of text. This means spacing is now configured via normal show-set rules for <a href="https://typst.app/docs/reference/layout/block/#parameters-spacing" title="`block.spacing`"><code>block.spacing</code></a>.</p> <pre><code><span>// Typst 0.13+ ✅</span>

</code></pre> <p>In Typst 0.12 and below, outline entries expose a few fields like <code>.body</code> and <code>.page</code> that are useful for writing an outline entry show rule. These fields were derived from other fields for your convenience. Typst 0.13 makes this more explicit and idiomatic by turning them into methods. Read the <a href="https://typst.app/docs/reference/model/outline/#building-an-entry">documentation on outline customization</a> for more details on how to use these methods.</p> <pre><code><span>// Typst 0.13+ ✅</span>

This led me down a rabbit hole of research into TTPs that Chinese cybersecurity entities have attributed to the NSA – or, as they coin “APT-C-40”.</span></p><p><span>These insights stem from extensive research I did on Weixin containing intelligence reports published by China’s Qihoo 360, Pangu Lab, and the National Computer Virus Emergency Response Center (CVERC). It is important to note that the authenticity and extent of these allegations remain unverified by independent sources. My goal in writing this blog is simply to aggregate and share what Chinese sources are publishing about NSA’s cyber operations (APT-C-40) to see if I could learn any new detection techniques or offensive techniques to research for fun.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>As I did this research, I had a realisation that the Chinese methodology of Incident Response appears very different to how we perform IR in the West and had me thinking more about how I could modify some of my own methodologies to include some of the learnings. Maybe I will write a blog on this in the future.&nbsp;</span><span>Ultimately, depending on the reception of this blog, I may continue this series by sharing my other findings on Chinese reports regarding CIA (APT-C-39) cyber operations and a third North American group (not NSA or CIA) that Chinese firms are tracking named APT-C-57.</span></p><h2><span><b><span>How the
NSA Allegedly Hacked China’s <strong>Northwestern
Polytechnical University</strong></span></b></span></h2><p><span>This is how China’s Northwestern Polytechnical University,
a leading institution specializing in aerospace and defence, allegedly became
the target of a sophisticated cyberattack attributed to the NSA’s APT-C-40 group<strong><span> back in 2022</span></strong>.
Reports claim that the attack was executed by Tailored Access Operations (TAO)<b>,</b> a
division within the NSA, which allegedly deployed over 40 unique malware strains
to conduct data theft and
espionage.<p>

All the information regarding this breach is publicly disclosed on the internet
by Chinese cyber companies Qihoo 360 and National Computer Virus Emergency
Response Centre on Weixin.</p></span></p><p><span><b><span>How did China
perform the attribution?</span></b>Through the joint investigation and forensics on
the University, CVERC and 360 identified 4 IPs that the NSA supposedly purchased
through two cover companies “Jackson Smith Consultants” and “Mueller
Diversified Systems”. The four IPs identified are listed at the end of this
report. CVERC and 360 alleged a TAO employee with the pseudonym “Amanda
Ramirez” anonymously purchased these for the NSA’s FoxAcid platform which was
later used in the attack on the University.<p>

CVERC and 360 also alleged that the NSA had used anonymous protection services
of a Registrar in the US to anonymize domain names and certificates to prevent
them from being queried by public channels. <b><o:p></o:p></b></p></span></p><p><span>Investigators from CVERC
and 360 were able to trace the attack back to NSA's TAO unit
through a mix of human error, patterns in their analysis and tool overlap.&nbsp;</span></p><p><b><span lang="EN-GB"><span>1. Attack Times</span></span></b></p><ul><li><span><span>One of the frameworks used by TAO that was
forensically uncovered during the incident named “NOPEN” requires human
operation. As such, a lot of the attack required hands-on-keyboard and data analysis
of the incident timeline showed 98% of all the attacks occurred during 9am –
16pm EST (US working hours).<br></span></span></li><li><span><span>There were zero cyber-attacks on Saturdays and Sundays
with all attacks centralised between Mon-Fri.<br></span></span></li><li><span><span>No attacks occurred during Memorial Day and
Independence Day holidays which were unique American holidays.<br></span></span></li><li><span><span>No attacks occurred during Christmas.<br></span></span></li></ul><p><b><span lang="EN-GB"><span>2. Keyboard Inputs</span></span></b></p><ul><li><span><span>Attacker used American English.</span></span></li><li><span><span>All devices used by the attacker had English OS and
English applications.<br></span></span></li><li><span><span>American keyboard was utilised.<br></span></span></li></ul><p><b><span lang="EN-GB"><span>3. Human Errors</span></span></b></p><ul><li><span><span>Due to the length and scale of the incident, when one
of the alleged NSA “attackers” tried to upload and run a Pyscript tool, they
forgot to modify the parameters. This returned an error – the error message
exposed the working directory and file name of the attacker’s internet
terminal.<br></span></span></li><li><span><span>This was then used to identify that they were running on a Linux
system and the directory “etc/autoutils” was known to be the special name of
the TAO network attack tool directory.</span></span></li><li><i><span>The error message is as follows: Quantifier follows nothing in regex; marked
by &lt;-- HERE in m/* &lt;-- HERE .log/ at .. /etc/autoutils line 4569</span></i></li></ul><p><b><span lang="EN-GB"><span>4. Tools Were Found Prior to Shadow Brokers Leak</span></span></b></p><ul><li><span><span lang="EN-GB">The </span><span>Northwestern Polytechnical University had
allegedly suffered multiple breaches throughout the years where several pieces
of malware uncovered in prior investigations (prior to Shadow Broker’s leak)
were allegedly the same tools described in the Shadow Broker’s leak</span><span>.

Alleged NSA TTPs </span><o:p></o:p></span></b></p><p><b><span><br>1. Pre Attack Preparation<o:p></o:p></span></b></p><p><span>One of the NSA's
primary strategies in breaching the university was the use of zero-days.
However, to begin the attack the attackers first conducted a pre-attack
preparation phase with extensive work. Two zero-days were used to breach any
company with SunOS-exposed systems in neighbouring countries to China. 360 and
CVERC did not specify which vulnerabilities were targeted in their reports. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span>Specifically, the
NSA would target any server with large network traffic (i.e. educational
institutions and commercial organisations). Once the attack was successful,
they would install NOPEN (more on this later) to establish a foothold. By
deploying zero-days on these systems, they established access on these systems
that would later be used as springboards for the main attack on the University.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span lang="EN-GB"><span>In total, 54 jump servers and 5 proxy
servers were used to perform the attack coming from 17 different countries
including Japan, South Korea, Sweden, Poland and Ukraine with 70% of the
attacks coming from China’s neighbouring countries. <o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p><span>The proprietary tool that was alleged to be run:<o:p></o:p></span></p><ul><li><span>SHAVER: This tool was used to attack the SunOS exposed servers that were used for the jump servers. This was identified as an automated exploitation tool designed for x86 and SPARC architectures with RPC services enabled.</span></li></ul><p><b><span><span>2. Initial Access into the University<o:p></o:p></span></span></b></p><p><span><span>To gain access into the network, they leveraged
MiTM and spear phishing emails. Around April, there were phishing emails
identified with references to “scientific research review” targeted towards
members of the University (students and teachers). These phishing emails
contained malware embedded in them and some were designed to steal credentials
from these users.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p><span><span>Aside from this, 360 and CVERC also reported that
one of the platforms used was a platform coined as <a href="https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/document/22069-document-01" target="_blank">“FOXACID” which was a partof the Snowden leaks</a>.
This platform according to Wikileaks, 360 and CVERC is a 0-day vulnerability
attack platform designed by the NSA to automate delivery of browser (IE, Chrome,
FireFox, Safari, Android Webkit etc) exploits to workstations, servers and
mobile devices. </span><span>When
a user tries to access a website like Gmail, BiliBili (Chinese YouTube) instead
of the normal server response, the response is hijacked to redirect to APT-C-40
(NSA) controlled server which injects malware onto the user’s browser. Below is
a diagram 360 drew of how it works (I translated it into English with Google).</span></span></p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEj1P0TE4Oh0Z4EQxcaQEnNlYSka8ToIPtvBoVoyBXm-POJpCFVgD6FyoAMAUz84CMKrSgm2X_LjWphSyUoJ4XSYznhIklIXF-YG4g31uydFzwqoOOiOyrD2G9wi0M6vEiSczvstxIpftVEZa_qdoHqt1R7UVf29mT-chOUS5MVG_BmXfm4NTIzhXaqMrXfw"><img alt="" data-original-height="1024" data-original-width="1379" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEj1P0TE4Oh0Z4EQxcaQEnNlYSka8ToIPtvBoVoyBXm-POJpCFVgD6FyoAMAUz84CMKrSgm2X_LjWphSyUoJ4XSYznhIklIXF-YG4g31uydFzwqoOOiOyrD2G9wi0M6vEiSczvstxIpftVEZa_qdoHqt1R7UVf29mT-chOUS5MVG_BmXfm4NTIzhXaqMrXfw=s16000"></a></td></tr><tr><td>Qihoo 360 - Diagram</td></tr></tbody></table><p><span><span>The question would be “how did they use FOXACID”
without having compromised systems? Based on the reports it seems like this is
a logical sequence of events:<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><ol><li><span><span>External servers of the University were compromised
giving APT-C-40 foothold into the environment using a tool called ISLAND
(manual exploitation of Solaris systems)</span></span></li><li><span><span>APT-C-40 installed a framework called SECONDDATE an
</span><span lang="EN-GB">espionage software designed to be installed on network
devices (gateways, border routers and firewalls). There is a server and control
side to the tool. The server is run on the network edge device and the traffic
is monitored/tampered through a driver. The communication back to controller is
encrypted and the port used is randomised. Second date has capabilities of
network eavesdropping, MiTM, and code injection. It can be used with other
malware to perform espionage activities. It’s primarily used to hijack mass
amounts of data traffic, tampering and misdirection.</span></span></li><li><span><span>SECONDDATE redirects traffic from users within the
University network accessing popular sites like BiliBili to FOXACID platform
which performs the browser exploitation on the student/staff devices to gain
control.&nbsp;</span></span></li></ol><p><span><span>Using this MiTM platform, they allegedly hijacked
internal hosts and servers of the University before deploying further tools for
remote control of the systems. This allowed them access into core network
equipment, servers and terminals relating to ops and maintenance of the
University network. Of interest (and this appears to be a pattern), APT-C-40
(according to 360 and CVERC) had a keen interest on network devices like
routers and switches. <o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p><span><span>The proprietary tools that were alleged to be run
include:<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><ul><li><span><span>ISLAND: This tool was
allegedly run against the University’s external servers to gain control. It is
a manual exploitation tool used to breach Solaris-based systems.</span></span></li><li><span><span>FOXACID: <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/10/how_the_nsa_att.html" target="_blank">Browserexploitation framework</a> that fingerprints the browser and deploys a 0-day.&nbsp;</span></span></li><li><span><span>SECONDDATE: This
tool was allegedly used by TAO (NSA) to hack into the office intranet of the
University. </span><span lang="EN-GB">Attribution of SECONDDATE was discovered through
collaboration with other industry partners. They found thousands of network
devices running this spyware – where the communications went back to NSA
servers located in Germany, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. This tool was used
to redirect user traffic to the FOXACID platform.</span></span></li></ul><p><b><span><span>3. Persistence and Lateral Movement<o:p></o:p></span></span></b></p><div>

<p><span><span>After securing
initial access, APT-C-40 focused on long-term persistence and lateral movement
across the university’s network. To avoid detection, they allegedly deployed a
combination of backdoors and credential theft techniques.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><ul><li><span lang="EN-GB"><span>SECONDDATE – Backdoor installed on network
edge devices such as gateways and border routers to filter, and hijack mass
amounts of data in a MiTM. This was placed on the border routers of the
University to hijack traffic to redirect to NSA’s FOXACID platform.</span></span></li><li><span><span>NOPEN: A remote-controlled
malware that provided NSA operators with ongoing access to compromised systems.
It allowed for file execution, process management, system command execution,
and privilege escalation. TAO used this to gain persistent control over core
business servers and key network equipment.</span></span></li><li><span lang="EN-GB"><span>FLAME SPRAY - Windows-based
remote-controlled malware with strong anti-analysis features. Can be customized
to generate different types of servers. Works with the "Acid Fox"
platform to control personal office network hosts. It has strong
anti-analysis/anti debug capabilities. </span></span></li><li><span><span>CUNNING HERETICS: A
lightweight implant that established encrypted communication channels for NSA
to remotely reactivate access points even after clean up attempts.</span></span></li><li><span><span>STOIC SURGEON: A
stealthy backdoor targeting Linux, Solaris, JunOS, and FreeBSD systems,
enabling the NSA to maintain control while avoiding security audits.</span></span></li></ul><p><b><span><span>4. Lateral Movement Techniques:<o:p></o:p></span></span></b></p><p><span><span>There was a keen focus from APT-C-40 on targeting
edge network devices. From the IR perspective this makes complete sense (lack
of EDR, lack of logs, lack of visibility and differing OS’s makes investigation
at scale incredible difficult and very manual). At this stage of the attack,
they used legitimate credentials to access firewall appliances and focused a
portion of the attacks on the telecom operators of the University. This was
highlighted by 360 and CVERC as their method of fingerprinting and accessing
personal data related to key researchers.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p></div><ul><li><span><span lang="EN-GB">Legitimate Credentials: NSA allegedly used
legitimate credentials for the Cisco PIX firewall, Tianrongxin firewall and
other equipment to scope out the intranet, monitor data, control the SMS
gateway and telecom operators. They then relied on other tools like MAGIC
SCHOOL to query sensitive personnel, encrypted the information and exfiltrated
it. The result of the queried data was saved to: </span><span lang="EN-GB">var/tmp/.2e434fd8aeae73e1/erf/out/f/</span><span lang="EN-GB"> before being encrypted and exfiltrated.<o:p></o:p></span></span></li><li><span><span>Hijacking Intranet
Upgrade Programs: The NSA allegedly compromised software update mechanisms to
distribute malware disguised as legitimate updates.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Credential
Harvesting via the tool DRINKING TEA: This tool sniffed SSH, Telnet, and Rlogin
passwords used by university IT administrators, granting NSA full access to
internal systems. </span><span lang="EN-GB">NSA allegedly used this to capture
command-line logs, passwords generated by University staff during their
operation and maintenance work. This data was them compressed and encrypted for
exfil by NOPEN. These credentials then gave them more access to edge devices
and business devices.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Hijacking Border
Routers: NSA installed Second Date spyware on university routers, allowing them
to intercept, manipulate, and reroute network traffic.</span></span></li></ul><p><b><span><span>5. Data Exfiltration: Stealing Critical Research
and Credentials<o:p></o:p></span></span></b></p><p><span><span>Once inside, NSA
operatives allegedly systematically stole classified research data, network
infrastructure details, and sensitive operational documents.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p><span><span>Exfiltration Methods Used:<b><o:p></o:p></b></span></span></p><ul><li><span><span>OPERATION BEHIND
ENEMY LINES: A suite of tools used to query, package, and encrypt stolen data
before transmitting it to NSA-controlled servers.</span></span></li><li><span><span>School of Magic,
Clown Food, and Cursed Fire: These NSA tools were specifically designed for
extracting sensitive files from telecom and defense research systems.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Use of Proxy
Servers &amp; VPNs: To avoid detection, stolen data was routed through 54 jump
servers and proxy nodes in 17 countries, masking the true origin of the
attackers.</span></span></li></ul><p><b><span><span>6. Evasion and Anti-Forensic Measures<o:p></o:p></span></span></b></p><div>

<p><span><span>To minimize the
risk of detection and forensic investigation, the NSA employed several
anti-forensic techniques (but most of these are inbuilt in the tools and
frameworks they leveraged):<o:p></o:p></span></span></p><ul><li><span><span>TOAST BREAD: A log
manipulation tool that erased evidence of unauthorized access, including UTMP,
WTMP, and LASTLOG files.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Encrypted
Communications: All NSA tools leveraged encryption, ensuring that traffic to
their command-and-control (C2) servers remained undetectable.</span></span></li></ul></div><p><span><b><span>What did I learn from this?</span></b><span><o:p></o:p></span></span></p><p><span>There is a clear and structured
collaboration amongst Chinese cybersecurity organizations during casework.
While industry collaboration exists in the West through closed invite-only
groups, Chinese cyber organizations openly acknowledge and publicize their
partnerships. This openness was particularly interesting to observe and may be
influenced by cultural factors, such as the Confucian emphasis on shared
knowledge and a political framework that encourages collective efforts.
Additionally, this collaboration extends across borders, involving
cybersecurity entities from multiple countries.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span>In the Incident Response process,
Western methodologies typically focus on constructing a super timeline of an
attack, detailing events in chronological order. We compile timelines, document
indicators of compromise (IoCs), and hand off reports to intelligence teams,
often accompanied by a verbal debrief. However, large-scale data analysis using
AI across multiple cases—or even on a single case—is not a standard practice. A
key observation from the Chinese case notes was the extensive use of big data
analysis, particularly in tracking “hands-on keyboard” activity. This approach enabled
Qihoo 360 to identify patterns, such as the alleged absence of activity on
Memorial Day, and precisely documenting the operational hours of the attackers,
allowing 360 to isolate activity to Monday-Friday, EST working hours.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span>Attacks on edge devices, IoT,
and network appliances appear to be becoming the norm. From a threat actor’s
perspective, this makes complete sense. Most adversaries are aware that XDR/EDR
solutions are deployed on traditional endpoints, making edge devices an
attractive target for initial access and persistence. Defending and detecting
such threats is particularly challenging due to the variety of operating
systems, proprietary encoding methods, and the extensive manual forensic
analysis required. The focus on edge devices is not unique to the NSA—it is an
emerging trend that is likely to escalate. We have already seen Chinese APTs
and Russian actors adopting similar techniques, including firmware
manipulation. It will be interesting to see how this space evolves.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span>Finally, across the reports,
there were sporadic mentions that most of the attack frameworks operated
in-memory, with no files written to disk. This is not abnormal to see –
however, it is interesting always to observe how the investigation and
forensics was done. One area I wish had been covered in more detail was the
methodology used to investigate these attacks, particularly how IR teams
conducted forensic analysis on edge devices and routers.</span></p><p><b><span><span>Alleged NSA IoCs</span><span><o:p></o:p></span></span></b></p><p><span><span><i>The IPs are redacted by 360 and CVERC (not me).<br></i><br><b>NSA IPs (Purchased through cover companies):<o:p></o:p></b></span></span></p><p><span><span>209.59.36.xx<br>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <article>
  
  <time datetime="2025-02-19T00:00:00+00:00">19 Feb 2025</time>
  <p>Often when designing systems, we aim for perfection in things like consistency of data, availability, latency, and more.</p>

<p>The hardest part of system design is that it’s difficult (if not impossible) to design systems that have perfect consistency, perfect availability, incredibly low latency, and incredibly high throughput, all at the same time.</p>

<p>Instead, when we approach system design, it’s best to treat each of these properties as points on different axes that we balance to find the “right fit” for the application we’re supporting.</p>

<p>I recently made some major tradeoffs in the design of <a href="https://bsky.app/">Bluesky’s</a> Following Feed/Timeline to improve the performance of writes at the cost of consistency in a way that doesn’t negatively affect users but reduced P99s by over 96%.</p>

<h2 id="timeline-fanout">Timeline Fanout</h2>

<p>When you make a post on Bluesky, your post is indexed by our systems and persisted to a database where we can fetch it to hydrate and serve in API responses.</p>

<p>Additionally, a reference to your post is “fanned out” to your followers so they can see it in their Timelines.</p>

<p><img src="https://jazco.dev/public/images/2025-02-19/fanout_diagram.png" alt="Fanout Diagram"></p>

<p>This process involves looking up all of your followers, then inserting a new row into each of their Timeline tables in reverse chronological order with a reference to your post.</p>

<p>When a user loads their Timeline, we fetch a page of post references and then hydrate the posts/actors concurrently to quickly build an API response and let them see the latest content from people they follow.</p>

<p>The Timelines table is sharded by user. This means each user gets their own Timeline partition, randomly distributed among shards of our horizontally scalable database (ScyllaDB), replicated across multiple shards for high availability.</p>

<p>Timelines are regularly trimmed when written to, keeping them near a target length and dropping older post references to conserve space.</p>

<h2 id="hot-shards-in-your-area">Hot Shards in Your Area</h2>

<p>Bluesky currently has around <a href="https://bsky.jazco.dev/stats">32 Million Users</a> and our Timelines database is broken into hundreds of shards.</p>

<p>To support millions of partitions on such a small number of shards, each user’s Timeline partition is colocated with tens of thousands of other users’ Timelines.</p>

<p><img src="https://jazco.dev/public/images/2025-02-19/shard_diagram.png" alt="Hot Shard Diagram"></p>

<p>Under normal circumstances with all users behaving well, this doesn’t present a problem as the work of an individual Timeline is small enough that a shard can handle the work of tens of thousands of them without being heavily taxed.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, with a large number of users, some of them will do abnormal things like… well… following hundreds of thousands of other users.</p>

<p>Generally, this can be dealt with via policy and moderation to prevent abusive users from causing outsized load on systems, but these processes take time and can be imperfect.</p>

<p>When a user follows hundreds of thousands of others, their Timeline becomes hyperactive with writes and trimming occurring at massively elevated rates.</p>

<p>This load slows down the individual operations to the user’s Timeline, which is fine for the bad behaving user, but causes problems to the tens of thousands of other users sharing a shard with them.</p>

<p>We typically call this situation a “Hot Shard”: where some resident of a shard has “hot” data that is being written to or read from at much higher rates than others. Since the data on the shard is only replicated a few times, we can’t effectively leverage the horizontal scale of our database to process all this additional work.</p>

<p>Instead, the “Hot Shard” ends up spending so much time doing work for a single partition that operations to the colocated partitions slow down as well.</p>

<p><img src="https://jazco.dev/public/images/2025-02-19/hot_shard_cpu.png" alt="btop output showing some cores at 100% cpu util but not others"></p>

<h2 id="stacking-latencies">Stacking Latencies</h2>

<p>Returning to our Fanout process, let’s consider the case of Fanout for a user followed by 2,000,000 other users.</p>

<p>Under normal circumstances, writing to a single Timeline takes an average of ~600 microseconds. If we sequentially write to the Timelines of our user’s followers, we’ll be sitting around for 20 minutes at best to Fanout this post.</p>

<p>If instead we concurrently Fanout to 1,000 Timelines at once, we can complete this Fanout job in ~1.2 seconds.</p>

<p>That sounds great, except it oversimplifies an important property of systems: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200603133348/https://robertovitillo.com/why-you-should-measure-tail-latencies/">tail latencies</a>.</p>

<p>The <em>average</em> latency of a write is ~600 microseconds, but some writes take much less time and some take much more. In fact, the P99 latency of writes to the Timelines cluster can be as high as 15 milliseconds!</p>

<p><img src="https://jazco.dev/public/images/2025-02-19/write_latencies.png" alt="Graph of write latency P99s on Timelines cluster with spikes poking past 10ms"></p>

<p>What does this mean for our Fanout? Well, if we concurrently write to 1,000 Timelines at once, statistically we’ll see 10 writes as slow as or slower than 15 milliseconds.</p>

<p>In the case of timelines, each “page” of followers is 10,000 users large and each “page” must be fanned out before we fetch the next page.</p>

<p>This means that our slowest writes will hold up the fetching and Fanout of the next page. How does this affect our expected Fanout time?</p>

<p>Each “page” will have ~100 writes as slow as or slower than the P99 latency. If we get unlucky, they could all stack up on a single routine and end up slowing down a single page of Fanout to 1.5 seconds.</p>

<p>In the worst case, for our 2,000,000 Follower celebrity, their post Fanout could end up taking as long as 5 minutes!</p>

<p>That’s not even considering P99.9 and P99.99 latencies which could end up being &gt;1 second, which could leave us waiting tens of minutes for our Fanout job.</p>

<p>Now imagine how bad this would be for a user with 20,000,000+ Followers!</p>

<p>So, how do we fix the problem? By embracing imperfection, of course!</p>

<h2 id="lossy-timelines">Lossy Timelines</h2>

<p>Imagine a user who follows hundreds of thousands of others. Their Timeline is being written to hundreds of times a second, moving so fast it would be humanly impossible to keep up with the entirety of their Timeline even if it was their full-time job.</p>

<p>For a given user, there’s a threshold beyond which it is <em>unreasonable</em> for them to be able to keep up with their Timeline. Beyond this point, they likely consume content through various other feeds and do not primarily use their Following Feed.</p>

<p>Additionally, beyond this point, it is <em>reasonable</em> for us to not necessarily have a perfect chronology of everything posted by the many thousands of users they follow, but provide enough content that the Timeline always has something new.</p>

<p><em>Note in this case I’m using the term “reasonable” to loosely convey that as a social media service, there must be a limit to the amount of work we are expected to do for a single user.</em></p>

<p>What if we introduce a mechanism to reduce the correctness of a Timeline such that there is a limit to the amount of work a single Timeline can place on a DB shard.</p>

<p>We can assert a <code>reasonable limit</code> for the number of follows a user should have to have a healthy and active Timeline, then increase the “lossiness” of their Timeline the further past that limit they go.</p>

<p>A <code>loss_factor</code> can be defined as <code>min(reasonable_limit/num_follows, 1)</code> and can be used to probabilistically drop writes to a Timeline to prevent hot shards.</p>

<p>Just before writing a page in Fanout, we can generate a random float between <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>, then compare it to the <code>loss_factor</code> of each user in the page. If the user’s <code>loss_factor</code> is smaller than the generated float, we filter the user out of the page and don’t write to their Timeline.</p>

<p>Now, users all have the same number of “follows worth” of Fanout. For example with a <code>reasonable_limit</code> of 2,000, a user who follows 4,000 others will have a <code>loss_factor</code> of <code>0.5</code> meaning half the writes to their Timeline will get dropped. For a user following 8,000 others, their loss factor of <code>0.25</code> will drop 75% of writes to their Timeline.</p>

<p>Thus, each user has a effective ceiling on the amount of Fanout work done for their Timeline.</p>

<p>By specifying the limits of <em>reasonable</em> user behavior and embracing imperfection for users who go beyond it, we can continue to provide service that meets the expectations of users without sacrificing scalability of the system.</p>

<h3 id="aside-on-caching">Aside on Caching</h3>

<p>We write to Timelines at a rate of more than one million times a second during the busy parts of the day. Looking up the number of follows of a given user before fanning out to them would require more than one million additional reads per second to our primary database cluster. This additional load would not be well received by our database and the additional cost wouldn’t be worth the payoff for faster Timeline Fanout.</p>

<p>Instead, we implemented an approach that caches high-follow accounts in a Redis sorted set, then each instance of our Fanout service loads an updated version of the set into memory every 30 seconds.</p>

<p>This allows us to perform lookups of follow counts for high-follow accounts millions of times per second per Fanount service instance.</p>

<p>By caching values which don’t need to be perfect to function correctly in this case, we can once again embrace imperfection in the system to improve performance and scalability without compromising the function of the service.</p>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<p>We implemented Lossy Timelines a few weeks ago on our production systems and saw a dramatic reduction in hot shards on the Timelines database clusters.</p>

<p>In fact, there now appear to be no hot shards in the cluster at all, and the P99 of a page of Fanout work has been reduced by over 90%.</p>

<p><img src="https://jazco.dev/public/images/2025-02-19/single_page_fanout_drop.png" alt="Single Page Fanout Latency Graph"></p>

<p>Additionally, with the reduction in write P99s, the P99 duration for a full post Fanout has been reduced by over 96%. Jobs that used to take 5-10 minutes for large accounts now take &lt;10 seconds.</p>

<p><img src="https://jazco.dev/public/images/2025-02-19/fanout_p99_after.png" alt="Fanout Job After P99 Latency Graph"></p>

<p>Knowing where it’s okay to be imperfect lets you trade consistency for other desirable aspects of your systems and scale ever higher.</p>

<p>There are plenty of other places for improvement in our Timelines architecture, but this step was a big one towards improving throughput and scalability of Bluesky’s Timelines.</p>

<h2 id="harnessing-a-new-type-of-material">Harnessing a new type of material</h2>



<p>All of today’s announcements build on our team’s recent breakthrough: the world’s first topoconductor. This revolutionary class of materials enables us to create <em>topological superconductivity,</em> a <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prb/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevB.107.245423" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new state of matter</a> that previously existed only in theory. The advance stems from Microsoft’s innovations in the design and fabrication of gate-defined devices that combine indium arsenide (a semiconductor) and aluminum (a superconductor). When cooled to near absolute zero and tuned with magnetic fields, these devices form topological superconducting nanowires with Majorana Zero Modes (MZMs) at the wires’ ends.</p>


<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;imageId&quot;:&quot;67b6230045a7d&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img decoding="async" data-wp-class--hide="state.isContentHidden" data-wp-class--show="state.isContentVisible" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on-async--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/quantum/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Measurement-graphic.webp" alt="A graphic showcasing reliably reading quantum information: ease of measurement and distinct results." srcset="" data-orig-src="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/quantum/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Measurement-graphic.webp"><figcaption><em>Figure 1: Reading the state of our topological qubit</em>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>For nearly a century, these quasiparticles existed only in textbooks. Now, we can <a href="https://quantum.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/microsoft-quantum-hardware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">create and control them on demand in our topoconductors</a>. MZMs are the building blocks of our qubits, storing quantum information through ‘parity’—whether the wire contains an even or odd number of electrons. In conventional superconductors, electrons bind into Cooper pairs and move without resistance. Any unpaired electron can be detected because its presence requires extra energy. Our topoconductors are different: here, an unpaired electron is shared between a pair of MZMs, making it invisible to the environment. This unique property protects the quantum information.</p>



<p>While this makes our topoconductors ideal candidates for qubits, it also presents a challenge: How do we read quantum information that is so well hidden? How can we distinguish between, say, 1,000,000,000 and 1,000,000,001 electrons?</p>



<p>Our solution to this measurement challenge works as follows (also see Figure 1):</p>



<ul>
<li>We use digital switches to couple both ends of the nanowire to a quantum dot, which is a tiny semiconductor device that can store electrical charge.</li>



<li>This connection increases the dot’s ability to hold charge. Crucially, the exact increase depends on the parity of the nanowire.</li>



<li>We measure this change using microwaves. The dot’s ability to hold charge determines how the microwaves reflect off the quantum dot. As a result, they return carrying an imprint of the nanowire’s quantum state.</li>
</ul>



<p>We designed our devices so these changes are large enough to measure reliably in a single shot. Our initial measurements had an error probability of 1%, and we’ve identified clear paths to significantly reduce this.</p>



<p>Our system shows impressive stability. External energy—such as electromagnetic radiation—can break Cooper pairs, creating unpaired electrons that can flip the qubit’s state from even to odd parity. However, our results show that this is rare, occurring only once per millisecond on average. This indicates that the shielding that envelops our processor is effective at keeping such radiation out. We are exploring ways to reduce this even further.</p>



<p>It’s perhaps not surprising that quantum computation would require us to engineer a new state of matter specifically designed to enable it. What’s remarkable is how accurate our readout technique already is, demonstrating that we are harnessing this exotic state of matter for quantum computation.</p>



<h2 id="revolutionizing-quantum-control-through-digital-precision">Revolutionizing quantum control through digital precision</h2>



<p>This readout technique enables a fundamentally different approach to quantum computing in which measurements are used to perform calculations.</p>



<p>Traditional quantum computing rotates quantum states through precise angles, requiring complex analog control signals customized for each qubit. This complicates quantum error correction (QEC), which must rely on these same sensitive operations to detect and correct errors.</p>



<p>Our measurement-based approach simplifies QEC dramatically. We perform error correction entirely through measurements activated by simple digital pulses that connect and disconnect quantum dots from nanowires. This digital control makes it practical to manage the large numbers of qubits needed for real-world applications.</p>



<h2 id="from-physics-to-engineering">From physics to engineering</h2>

The first panel shows a single-qubit device. The tetron is formed through two parallel topological wires (blue) with an MZM at each end (orange dot) connected by a perpendicular trivial superconducting wire (light blue). The next panel shows a two-qubit device that supports measurement-based braiding transformations. The third panel shows a 4×2 array of tetrons supporting a quantum error detection demonstration on two logical qubits. These demonstrations build toward quantum error correction, such as on the device shown in the right panel (a 27×13 tetron array).</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>With the core building blocks now demonstrated—quantum information encoded in MZMs, protected by topology, and processed through measurements—we’re ready to move from physics breakthrough to practical implementation.</p>



<p>The next step is <a href="https://aka.ms/MSBrandArXivTopo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a scalable architecture</a> built around a single-qubit device called a tetron (see Figure 2). At the Station Q meeting, we shared data demonstrating the basic operation of this qubit. One fundamental operation—measuring the parity of one of the topological nanowires in a tetron—uses the same technique described in our <a href="https://aka.ms/MSQuantumNaturePaper" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Nature </em>paper</a>.</p>



<p>Another key operation puts the qubit in a superposition of parity states. This, too, is performed by a microwave reflectometry measurement of a quantum dot, but in a different measurement configuration in which we decouple the first quantum dot from the nanowire and connect a different dot to both nanowires at one end of the device. By performing these two orthogonal Pauli measurements, <em>Z</em> and <em>X</em>, we’ve demonstrated measurement-based control—a crucial milestone that unlocks the next steps on our roadmap.</p>



<p>Our roadmap now leads systematically toward scalable QEC. The next steps will involve a 4×2 tetron array. We will first use a two-qubit subset to demonstrate entanglement and measurement-based braiding transformations. Using the entire eight-qubit array, we will then implement quantum error detection on two logical qubits.</p>



<p>The built-in error protection of topological qubits simplifies QEC. Moreover, our <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/azure-quantum-innovation-efficient-error-correction-of-topological-qubits-with-floquet-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">custom QEC codes</a> reduce overhead roughly tenfold compared to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/optimization-of-the-surface-code-design-for-majorana-based-qubits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the previous state-of-the-art approach</a>. This dramatic reduction means that our scalable system can be built from fewer physical qubits and has the potential to run at a faster clock speed.</p>



<h2 id="darpa-s-recognition-of-our-approach">DARPA’s recognition of our approach</h2>



<p>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/news/2025/quantum-computing-approaches" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(DARPA) has selected Microsoft</a> as one of two companies to advance to the final phase of their rigorous benchmarking program known as <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/research/programs/underexplored-systems-for-utility-scale-quantum-computing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Underexplored Systems for Utility-Scale Quantum Computing (US2QC)</a>—one of the programs that makes up DARPA’s larger Quantum Benchmarking Initiative (QBI). Microsoft views this recognition as validation of our roadmap for building a fault-tolerant quantum computer with topological qubits.</p>



<p>DARPA’s US2QC program and its broader Quantum Benchmarking Initiative represent a rigorous approach to evaluating quantum systems that could solve problems that are beyond the capabilities of classical computers. To date, the US2QC program has brought together experts from DARPA, Air Force Research Laboratory, Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and NASA Ames Research Center to verify quantum hardware, software, and applications. Going forward, the larger Quantum Benchmarking Initiative is expected to engage with even more experts in the testing and evaluation of quantum computers.</p>



<p>Previously, DARPA selected Microsoft for an earlier phase upon an assessment that we could plausibly build a utility-scale quantum computer in a reasonable timeframe. DARPA then evaluated the Microsoft quantum team’s architectural designs and engineering plan for a fault-tolerant quantum computer. As a result of this careful analysis, DARPA and Microsoft have executed an agreement to begin the final phase of the program. During this phase, <strong>Microsoft intends to build a fault-tolerant prototype based on topological qubits in years, not decades</strong>—a crucial acceleration step toward utility-scale quantum computing.</p>



<h2 id="unlocking-quantum-s-promise">Unlocking quantum’s promise</h2>



<p>Eighteen months ago, we laid out our <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/quantum/2023/06/21/microsoft-achieves-first-milestone-towards-a-quantum-supercomputer/">roadmap to a quantum supercomputer</a>. <strong>Today we hit our second milestone, demonstrating the world’s first topological qubit. </strong>And we’ve already placed eight topological qubits on a chip designed to house one million.</p>



<p>A million-qubit quantum computer isn’t just a milestone—it’s a gateway to solving some of the world’s most difficult problems. Even today’s most powerful supercomputers cannot accurately predict the quantum processes that determine the properties of the materials essential to our future. But quantum computing at this scale could lead to innovations like self-healing materials that repair cracks in bridges, sustainable agriculture, and safer chemical discovery. What today requires billions of dollars in exhaustive experimental searches and wet-lab experiments could be found, instead, through calculation on a quantum computer.</p>



<p>Our path to useful quantum computing is clear. The foundational technology is proven, and we believe our architecture is scalable. Our new agreement with DARPA shows a commitment to relentless progress toward our goal: building a machine that can drive scientific discovery and solve problems that matter. Stay tuned for more updates on our journey.</p>

<p>Microsoft today <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/azure-quantum/">introduced Majorana 1</a>, the world’s first quantum chip powered by a new Topological Core architecture that it expects will realize quantum computers capable of solving meaningful, industrial-scale problems in years, not decades.</p>



<p>It leverages the world’s first topoconductor, a breakthrough type of material which can observe and control Majorana particles to produce more reliable and scalable qubits, which are the building blocks for quantum computers.</p>



<p>In the same way that the invention of semiconductors made today’s smartphones, computers and electronics possible, <a href="https://aka.ms/MSQuantumAQblog">topoconductors and the new type of chip they enable</a> offer a path to developing quantum systems that can scale to a million qubits and are capable of tackling the most complex industrial and societal problems, Microsoft said.</p>



<p>“We took a step back and said ‘OK, let’s invent the transistor for the quantum age. What properties does it need to have?’” said Chetan Nayak, Microsoft technical fellow. “And that’s really how we got here – it’s the particular combination, the quality and the important details in our new materials stack that have enabled a new kind of qubit and ultimately our entire architecture.”</p>

<p>This new architecture used to develop the Majorana 1 processor offers a clear path to fit a million qubits on a single chip that can fit in the palm of one’s hand, Microsoft said. This is a needed threshold for quantum computers to deliver transformative, real-world solutions – such as breaking down microplastics into harmless byproducts or inventing self-healing materials for construction, manufacturing or healthcare. All the world’s current computers operating together can’t do what a one-million-qubit quantum computer will be able to do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Whatever you’re doing in the quantum space needs to have a path to a million qubits. If it doesn’t, you’re going to hit a wall before you get to the scale at which you can solve the really important problems that motivate us,” Nayak said.&nbsp; “We have actually worked out a path to a million.”</p>



<p>The topoconductor, or topological superconductor, is a special category of material that can create an entirely new state of matter – not a solid, liquid or gas but a topological state. This is harnessed to produce a more stable qubit that is fast, small and can be digitally controlled, without the tradeoffs required by current alternatives. A new paper published Wednesday in Nature outlines how Microsoft researchers were able to create the topological qubit’s exotic quantum properties and also accurately measure them, an essential step for practical computing.</p>

<p>This breakthrough required developing an entirely new materials stack made of indium arsenide and aluminum, much of which Microsoft designed and fabricated atom by atom. The goal was to coax new quantum particles called Majoranas into existence and take advantage of their unique properties to reach the next horizon of quantum computing, Microsoft said. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The world’s first Topological Core powering the Majorana 1 is reliable by design, incorporating error resistance at the hardware level making it more stable.</p>



<p>Commercially important applications will also require trillions of operations on a million qubits, which would be prohibitive with current approaches that rely on fine-tuned analog control of each qubit. The Microsoft team’s new measurement approach enables qubits to be controlled digitally, redefining and vastly simplifying how quantum computing works.</p>



<p>This progress validates Microsoft’s choice years ago to pursue a topological qubit design – a high risk, high reward scientific and engineering challenge that is now paying off. Today, the company has placed eight topological qubits on a chip designed to scale to one million.</p>

<p>“From the start we wanted to make a quantum computer for commercial impact, not just thought leadership,” said Matthias Troyer, Microsoft technical fellow. “We knew we needed a new qubit. We knew we had to scale.”</p>



<p>That approach led the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), a federal agency that invests in breakthrough technologies that are important to national security, to include Microsoft in a rigorous program to evaluate whether innovative quantum computing technologies could build commercially relevant quantum systems faster than conventionally believed possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Microsoft is now one of two companies to be <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/news/2025/quantum-computing-approaches">invited to move to the final phase</a> of DARPA’s Underexplored Systems for Utility-Scale Quantum Computing (US2QC) program – one of the programs that makes up DARPA’s larger <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/research/programs/quantum-benchmarking-initiative">Quantum Benchmarking Initiative</a> – which aims to deliver the industry’s first utility-scale fault-tolerant quantum computer, or one whose computational value exceeds its costs.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>‘It just gives you the answer’</h2>



<p>In addition to making its own quantum hardware, Microsoft has partnered with Quantinuum and Atom Computing to reach <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/quantum/2024/09/10/microsoft-and-quantinuum-create-12-logical-qubits-and-demonstrate-a-hybrid-end-to-end-chemistry-simulation/">scientific and engineering breakthroughs</a> with today’s qubits, including the announcement last year of the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/quantum/2024/11/19/microsoft-and-atom-computing-offer-a-commercial-quantum-machine-with-the-largest-number-of-entangled-logical-qubits-on-record/?msockid=0d710b8d313360371e1f1f27301e6148">industry’s first reliable quantum computer</a>.</p>



<p>These types of machines <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/quantum/2025/01/14/2025-the-year-to-become-quantum-ready/?msockid=0d710b8d313360371e1f1f27301e6148">offer important opportunities to develop quantum skills</a>, build hybrid applications and drive new discovery, particularly as AI is combined with new quantum systems that will be powered by larger numbers of reliable qubits. Today, Azure Quantum offers a <a href="https://quantum.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/azure-quantum-solutions">suite of integrated solutions</a> allowing customers to leverage these leading AI, high performance computing and quantum platforms in Azure to advance scientific discovery.</p>



<p>But reaching the next horizon of quantum computing will require a quantum architecture that can provide a million qubits or more and reach trillions of fast and reliable operations. Today’s announcement puts that horizon within years, not decades, Microsoft said.</p>



<p>Because they can use quantum mechanics to mathematically map how nature behaves with incredible precision – from chemical reactions to molecular interactions and enzyme energies – million-qubit machines should be able to solve certain types of problems in chemistry, materials science and other industries that are impossible for today’s classical computers to accurately calculate.</p>



<ul>
<li>For instance, they could help solve the difficult chemistry question of why materials suffer corrosion or cracks. This could lead to self-healing materials that repair cracks in bridges or airplane parts, shattered phone screens or scratched car doors.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Because there are so many types of plastics, it isn’t currently possible to find a one-size-fits-all catalyst that can break them down – especially important for cleaning up microplastics or tackling carbon pollution. Quantum computing could calculate the properties of such catalysts to break down pollutants into valuable byproducts or develop non-toxic alternatives in the first place.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Enzymes, a kind of biological catalyst, could be harnessed more effectively in healthcare and agriculture, thanks to accurate calculations about their behavior that only quantum computing can provide. This could lead to breakthroughs helping to eradicate global hunger: boosting soil fertility to increase yields or promoting sustainable growth of foods in harsh climates.</li>
</ul>



<p>Most of all, quantum computing could allow engineers, scientists, companies and others to simply design things right the first time – which would be transformative for everything from healthcare to product development. The power of quantum computing, combined with AI tools, would allow someone to describe what kind of new material or molecule they want to create in plain language and get an answer that works straightaway – no guesswork or years of trial and error. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Any company that makes anything could just design it perfectly the first time out. It would just give you the answer,” Troyer said. “The quantum computer teaches the AI the language of nature so the AI can just tell you the recipe for what you want to make.”</p>



<h2>Rethinking quantum computing at scale</h2>



<p>The quantum world operates according to the laws of quantum mechanics, which are not the same laws of physics that govern the world we see. The particles are called qubits, or quantum bits, analogous to the bits, or ones and zeros, that computers now use.</p>



<p>Qubits are finicky and highly susceptible to perturbations and errors that come from their environment, which cause them to fall apart and information to be lost. Their state can also be affected by measurement – a problem because measuring is essential for computing. An inherent challenge is developing a qubit that can be measured and controlled, while offering protection from environmental noise that corrupts them.</p>



<p>Qubits can be created in different ways, each with advantages and disadvantages. Nearly 20 years ago, Microsoft decided to pursue a unique approach: developing topological qubits, which it believed would offer more stable qubits requiring less error correction, thereby unlocking speed, size and controllability advantages. The approach posed a steep learning curve, requiring uncharted scientific and engineering breakthroughs, but also the most promising path to creating scalable and controllable qubits capable of doing commercially valuable work.</p>



<figure><div>
<iframe title="Majorana 1 Explained: The Path to a Million Qubits" width="500" height="281" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wSHmygPQukQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></figure>



<p>The disadvantage is – or was – that until recently the exotic particles Microsoft sought to use, called Majoranas, had never been seen or made. They don’t exist in nature and can only be coaxed into existence with magnetic fields and superconductors. The difficulty of developing the right materials to create the exotic particles and their associated topological state of matter is why most quantum efforts have focused on other kinds of qubits.</p>



<p>The Nature paper marks peer-reviewed confirmation that Microsoft has not only been able to create Majorana particles, which help protect quantum information from random disturbance, but can also reliably measure that information from them using microwaves.</p>



<p>Majoranas hide quantum information, making it more robust, but also harder to measure. The Microsoft team’s new measurement approach is so precise it can detect the difference between one billion and one billion and one electrons in a superconducting wire – which tells the computer what state the qubit is in and forms the basis for quantum computation.</p>



<p>The measurements can be turned on and off with voltage pulses, like flicking a light switch, rather than finetuning dials for each individual qubit. This simpler measurement approach that enables digital control simplifies the quantum computing process and the physical requirements to build a scalable machine.</p>



<p>Microsoft’s topological qubit also has an advantage over other qubits because of its size. Even for something that tiny, there’s a “Goldilocks” zone, where a too-small qubit is hard to run control lines to, but a too-big qubit requires a huge machine, Troyer said. Adding the individualized control technology for those types of qubits would require building an impractical computer the size of an airplane hangar or football field.</p>



<p>Majorana 1, Microsoft’s quantum chip that contains both qubits as well as surrounding control electronics, can be held in the palm of one’s hand and fits neatly into a quantum computer that can be easily deployed inside Azure datacenters.</p>



<p>“It’s one thing to discover a new state of matter,” Nayak said. “It’s another to take advantage of it to rethink quantum computing at scale.”</p>



<h2>Designing quantum materials atom by atom</h2>



<p>Microsoft’s topological qubit architecture has aluminum nanowires joined together to form an H. Each H has four controllable Majoranas and makes one qubit. These Hs can be connected, too, and laid out across the chip like so many tiles.</p>



<p>“It’s complex in that we had to show a new state of matter to get there, but after that, it’s fairly simple. It tiles out. You have this much simpler architecture that promises a much faster path to scale,” said Krysta Svore, Microsoft technical fellow.</p>

Photo by John Brecher for Microsoft.&nbsp;&nbsp;</figcaption></figure>



<p>The quantum chip doesn’t work alone. It exists in an ecosystem with control logic, a dilution refrigerator that keeps qubits at temperatures much colder than outer space and a software stack that can integrate with AI and classical computers. All those pieces exist, built or modified entirely in-house, she said.</p>



<p>To be clear, continuing to refine those processes and getting all the elements to work together at accelerated scale will require more years of engineering work. But many difficult scientific and engineering challenges have now been met, Microsoft said.</p>



<p>Getting the materials stack right to produce a topological state of matter was one of the hardest parts, Svore added. Instead of silicon, Microsoft’s topoconductor is made of indium arsenide, a material currently used in such applications as infrared detectors and which has special properties. The semiconductor is married with superconductivity, thanks to extreme cold, to make a hybrid.</p>



<p>“We are literally spraying atom by atom. Those materials have to line up perfectly. If there are too many defects in the material stack, it just kills your qubit,” Svore said.</p>



<p>“Ironically, it’s also why we need a quantum computer – because understanding these materials is incredibly hard. With a scaled quantum computer, we will be able to predict materials with even better properties for building the next generation of quantum computers beyond scale,” she said.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-astro-cid-tnnyocjb="">    <p>I’m adding immutable vectors to my language, Ivan, and needed to pick a suitable data structure to implement them. Clojure uses Persistent Vectors (PVs) which support lookups, updates, and appends all in ‘effectively’ constant time. However, it doesn’t have efficient insert or merge operations. Relaxed Radix Balanced (RRB) Trees, introduced by Bagwell and Rompf in 2011, address this shortcoming.</p>
<p>I had to read a few different papers to properly understand how they worked so I thought I’d write an introduction in the hope of making it a tad easier for others. I’ll try to convey how they work and some intuition for why, while leaving the deeper mathematical treatment to the academic papers.</p>
<p>I will assume you’re already familiar with <a href="https://hypirion.com/musings/understanding-persistent-vector-pt-1">how Persistent Vectors work</a>.</p>
<h2 id="merging-persistent-vectors">Merging Persistent Vectors</h2>
<p>Let’s suppose we merge two Persistent Vectors, giving us the following result:</p>
<img src="https://peter.horne-khan.com/_astro/figure-1.C0izVYEa_Z6UaAU.svg" alt="Merging 2 Persistent Vectors" width="751" height="91" loading="lazy" decoding="async">
<p>Since we rely on a fixed node size (<span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>M</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">M</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>) for radix search to work, we must ensure that every node (except the right edge) has <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>M</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">M</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> children. A tree with this property is said to be <em>leftwise dense</em>. In this example, since the last child of the left vector only has 2 elements we must move 2 elements over from the right vector. Doing so imbalances the first child node of the right vector, so we must repeat the process with its subsequent children until all nodes are balanced. This process involves creating many new replacement nodes (shown in orange). The work that needs to be done is proportional to the size of the right vector.</p>
<h2 id="relax">Relax</h2>
<p>We need to relax the leftwise dense constraint, but doing so will introduce two problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>Radix search relies on each node having the same fixed branching factor.</li>
<li>The height of the tree, which is what lets us claim ‘effectively’ constant operations, is bounded by the fixed branching factor.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first problem can be overcome by recording the actual size of nodes somewhere. We’ll add a <em>size table</em> to each branch – an array with a length equal to the number of children contained in that node. Each entry in the size table records the <em>cumulative</em> number of elements contained in the corresponding child node, which we’ll refer to as a <em>slot</em>.</p>
<img src="https://peter.horne-khan.com/_astro/figure-2.UQI5iB4R_16LP2R.svg" alt="RRB Tree with size tables" width="591" height="151" loading="lazy" decoding="async">
<p>In this example, the root node has two children and we can see from the associated size table that the first child contains 14 elements, while the second contains 8 (<span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>22</mn><mo>−</mo><mn>14</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">22 - 14</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>). Since we can now derive the range of elements contained within each slot, finding an element is fairly straightforward. Suppose we wanted to retrieve the element at index position <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>16</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">16</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Starting at the root, the element we are searching for will be contained within the first slot that has a corresponding entry in the size table greater than the index we are looking up. In this case, we skip the first slot (since <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>16</mn><mo>&gt;</mo><mn>14</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">16 &gt; 14</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>) and find our element will be in the second slot (<span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>16</mn><mo>&lt;</mo><mn>22</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">16 &lt; 22</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>).</li>
<li>Before we repeat the process and search for the element within that slot, we need to adjust our index to account for all the elements in preceding nodes that we are now disregarding. We do that by simply subtracting the previous entry in the size table (<span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>14</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">14</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>) from our index (<span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>16</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">16</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>) which gives us a new index of <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">2</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</li>
<li>We step through the slots to find our element and this time it’s contained within the first slot (<span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>&lt;</mo><mn>3</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">2 &lt; 3</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>). Once again, we adjust our index before recursing – this time subtracting nothing because there is no previous entry in the size table.</li>
<li>We’ve now reached a leaf node which doesn’t have a size table since we can rely on normal array indexing instead.

<p>Doing a linear scan through the size table at each level of the tree is a lot more work than the handful of bit operations performed when radix indexing. However, we can combine the two approaches. Consider that if we’re allowing nodes to contain <em>fewer</em> than <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>M</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">M</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> slots then any elements that no longer fit in the current node will have to be placed in subsequent slots. Therefore we can use radix indexing on the size table to skip any slots that are guaranteed not to contain our element and then, if necessary, step forward until we find the right slot. We’ll soon introduce invariants that limit the number of additional slots we have to step to, on average, only 2 or 3.</p>
<p>Here’s how we might implement relaxed radix search in TypeScript:</p>

<p>Another simple optimisation that we could do is to omit the size table on nodes that are leftwise dense. In other words, we start with Persistent Vectors and only add size tables, incurring their costs, to the subset of nodes that are affected when merging.</p>
<h2 id="mm-1-invariant">M..M-1 Invariant</h2>
<p>To address the second problem, that the tree height is no longer bounded, we’ll reintroduce an invariant similar to the original Persistent Vector requirement that all nodes, except the rightmost edge, must contain <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>M</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">M</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> slots. To permit a variable slot size, we’ll require nodes to have between <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>M</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">M</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>M</mi><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">M -1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> slots. With our example branching factor of 4, nodes may now have 3 or 4 slots. In our implementation where we use a branching factor of 32, nodes may have 31 or 32 slots.</p>
<p>Exactly how this impacts the height of the tree wasn’t immediately obvious to me, so let’s break it down. With a branching factor of 32 the maximum addressable space is 4,294,967,295. In the best case, every node has 32 children, so the height is given by <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>l</mi><mi>o</mi><msub><mi>g</mi><mn>32</mn></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>4</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>294</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>967</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>295</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">log_{32}(4,294,967,295)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> which is 6.39 so we’ll have 7 levels. In the worst case, we have <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>l</mi><mi>o</mi><msub><mi>g</mi><mn>31</mn></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>4</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>294</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>967</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>295</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">log_{31}(4,294,967,295)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> which is 6.45… also only 7 levels!</p>
<p>Not only does this constrain the height of the tree but it also constrains the number of possible extra search steps we have to perform during lookup. Higher levels of the tree may require more steps than lower levels since the offsetting compounds. We can calculate the total possible extra steps at the top of a tree of height <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>h</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">h</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> by taking the difference between the maximum possible number of leaf elements, <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>M</mi><mi>h</mi></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">M^h</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, and the minimum possible number of leaf elements, <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>M</mi><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn><msup><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mi>h</mi></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">(M-1)^h</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, and dividing it by the number of slots under that level, <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>M</mi><mrow><mi>h</mi><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">M^{h-1}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>:</p>

<p>To make that concrete, the worst case for a tree with <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>5</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">5</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> levels and a branching factor of <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>32</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">32</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is an additional <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>4.69</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">4.69</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> steps. However, assuming a random distribution of node sizes between <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>M</mi><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">M-1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>M</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">M</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, then on average we only have to perform <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>2.49</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">2.49</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> additional steps which adds very little overhead. Especially since the relevant entries in the size table are small enough to fit in the CPU cache.</p>
<p>With the introduction of size tables and the <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>M</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi><mi>M</mi><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">M..M-1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> invariant we now have a data structure permitting some flexibility in the number of slots at each node while maintaining efficient lookup. Let’s revisit our earlier example of merging two vectors to see how many replacement nodes we now need to create to ensure a balanced tree.</p>
<img src="https://peter.horne-khan.com/_astro/figure-3.Dvv6G6cr_Z2qdjVz.svg" alt="Merging RRB under M..M-1 invariant" width="771" height="191" loading="lazy" decoding="async">
<p>The second leaf node has only 2 slots yet we must ensure each node has at least 3. The most efficient way to redistribute the slots is either to move the last slot of the first node, or the first slot of the third node, into the second node. In both cases we create 2 new replacement nodes rather than the 3 necessitated when using Persistent Vectors. This may not seem like much, since the trees in this example are shallow and we’re using a branching factor of 4 but we no longer need to shuffle <em>every</em> element in the right vector to the left which means we will be able to leave entire subtrees untouched when merging.</p>
<h2 id="search-step-invariant">Search Step Invariant</h2>
<p>However, we can do even better. You may have noticed that we merged 4 slots across 2 nodes into a single node with a total of… 4 slots. Had we simply merged both trees without rebalancing we would still have the same number of additional search steps for each index (at most 1). Could we use a different invariant that permits us to do that? What if rather than a lower bound on the branching factor we instead placed an invariant on the number of additional search steps permitted?</p>
<p>We know that the optimal number of slots to contain <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>P</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">P</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> nodes is <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">⌈</mo><mi>P</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">/</mi><mi>M</mi><mo stretchy="false">⌉</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lceil P / M \rceil</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> because we can fully fill up the first <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>P</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">/</mi><mi>M</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">P/M</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> slots and then use one additional slot to put the remainder in. Let’s say that we allow some constant, <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>E</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">E</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, of additional extra search steps then the total number of slots <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>S</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">S</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> we may use to contain <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>P</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">P</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> nodes is given by the inequality <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>S</mi><mo>≤</mo><mo stretchy="false">⌈</mo><mi>P</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">/</mi><mi>M</mi><mo stretchy="false">⌉</mo><mo>+</mo><mi>E</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">S \le \lceil P / M \rceil + E</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. We’ll call this the <em>Search Step Invariant</em>. Bagwell &amp; Rompf claim that with <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>M</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>32</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">M = 32</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, using <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>E</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">E = 2</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> provides a good balance between a small impact on the indexing time and a low concatenation cost. Although we’re only using <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>M</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>4</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">M = 4</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> in these examples we’ll use <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>E</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">E = 2</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> too.</p>
<p>Applying this new invariant to our example, we see that no rebalancing is necessary since <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>4</mn><mo>≤</mo><mo stretchy="false">⌈</mo><mn>14</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">/</mi><mn>4</mn><mo stretchy="false">⌉</mo><mo>+</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">4 \le \lceil 14 / 4 \rceil + 2</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, or  <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>4</mn><mo>≤</mo><mn>6</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">4 \le 6</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. In this simple example, merging is very efficient since we only need to recreate the parent node to contain the slots from both input trees. No children nodes need replacing since no rebalancing is required. We also know that lookup is efficient since there are, at most, only <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>E</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">E =2</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> additional search steps required at this level.</p>

<p>Now lets look at another example so we can see how the rebalancing algorithm works in detail. Then we’ll finally cover how to merge RRB trees.</p>
<img src="https://peter.horne-khan.com/_astro/figure-5.CBARG3PW_eHNOQ.svg" alt="Merging RRB under search step invariant with no rebalancing" width="972" height="92" loading="lazy" decoding="async">
<p>When rebalancing, we consider all <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>S</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">S</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> slots together. Since each of the 2 nodes we are merging have at most <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>M</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">M</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> slots, <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>S</mi><mo>≤</mo><mn>2</mn><mi>M</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">S \le 2M</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. To make things easier and reduce the amount of copying done, we first calculate a plan of how many items each slot should contain in the following way:</p>
<ol>
<li>Check if our invariant, <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>S</mi><mo>≤</mo><mo stretchy="false">⌈</mo><mi>P</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">/</mi><mi>M</mi><mo stretchy="false">⌉</mo><mo>+</mo><mi>E</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">S \le \lceil P / M \rceil + E</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, is met. If not, proceed.</li>
<li>Skip any slots with at least <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>M</mi><mo>−</mo><mrow><mi>E</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">/</mi><mn>2</mn></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">M-{E/2}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> items as these don’t need redistributing. Once we reach the first slot with fewer than <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>M</mi><mo>−</mo><mrow><mi>E</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">/</mi><mn>2</mn></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">M-{E/2}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> items, there will always be enough space in the subsequent slots for us to distribute the items over. (I don’t have a good explanation for <em>why</em> this is the case. The papers include a simple proof if you’re curious.)</li>
<li>Remove the slot that needs redistributing and add as many of its items as possible to the next slot, then as many of the remainder to the next one, and so on.</li>
<li>Repeat.</li>
</ol>
<p>Lets apply that to the example step by step:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, we check the invariant <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>7</mn><mo>≤</mo><mo stretchy="false">⌈</mo><mn>16</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">/</mi><mn>4</mn><mo stretchy="false">⌉</mo><mo>+</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">7 \le \lceil 16 / 4 \rceil + 2</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, or <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>7</mn><mo>≤</mo><mn>6</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">7 \le 6</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, which does not hold - so we need to redistribute some items to reduce the slot count.</li>
<li>We skip slots with 3 items or more (<span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>M</mi><mo>−</mo><mrow><mi>E</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">/</mi><mn>2</mn></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">M - {E/2}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>), which means we skip the first slot (contains 3) but need to distribute the second slot (contains 2).</li>
<li>Slots can contain at most <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>M</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">M</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> items so we add one item to the third slot and carry the remaining item over to the fourth slot.</li>
<li>This has reduced our total slot count by 1 so we check the invariant to see if we need to continue. If we do, we find the next slot with fewer than <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>M</mi><mo>−</mo><mi>E</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">/</mi><mn>2</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">M-E/2</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> items and redistribute it; however, since <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>6</mn><mo>≤</mo><mn>6</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">6 \le 6</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> we are done.</li>
</ol>
<p>We apply our plan to the original set of nodes, producing a new set conforming to our invariant. Nodes that already contain the desired number of items can be reused so we only need to copy items when creating slots that have been redistributed over. Bagwell &amp; Rompf claim this new invariant reduces the concatenation cost by a factor of 3.</p>
<p>Despite the somewhat lengthy explanation, the implementation is fairly simple:</p>

<h2 id="merging">Merging</h2>
<p>Finally, let’s merge some trees!</p>
<img src="https://peter.horne-khan.com/_astro/figure-6.D-xXlWtY_Vbb2.svg" alt="Merging 2 RRB Trees - Part #1" width="1141" height="152" loading="lazy" decoding="async">
<p>To reduce clutter, I won’t include the size tables in the subsequent diagrams but in the example implementation we create them as necessary when new nodes are created.</p>
<p>We start by walking down the left tree until we reach the slot pointing to the rightmost leaf node, and the right tree until we reach the slot pointing to the leftmost leaf node. We take these two slots and create a new node from them, thus leaving us with 3 nodes: the original left node minus its last slot, the newly created ‘middle’ node, and the original right node minus its first slot.</p>
<img src="https://peter.horne-khan.com/_astro/figure-7.eEursljJ_1SrHNv.svg" alt="Merging 2 RRB Trees - Part #2" width="1091" height="161" loading="lazy" decoding="async">
<p>We consider the slots of all 3 nodes together and rebalance as necessary, placing the result in a new parent node that will be carried up to the next level and merged in a recursive fashion. Presently, the search step invariant is not met so we redistribute the second slot (which is the first with fewer than <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>M</mi><mo>−</mo><mi>E</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">/</mi><mn>2</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">M - E/2</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> items) over its subsequent siblings, which is sufficient to rebalance the slots. We then create a parent node along with sufficient children to optimally contain the rebalanced slots. All newly created nodes are indicated in orange so you can see that the merging process is able to reuse a lot of the existing nodes, reducing the amount of work that needs to be done.</p>
<img src="https://peter.horne-khan.com/_astro/figure-8.CX0-kYdd_Z2bn0Ay.svg" alt="Merging 2 RRB Trees - Part #3" width="1091" height="161" loading="lazy" decoding="async">
<p>Since the parent node we created is 1 level higher than the nodes we merged, we move up a level an merge it with the other nodes at that level. Much like before, we drop the rightmost slot from the left node, and the rightmost slot from the left node, since those subtrees are already contained in our ‘middle’ node and then consider the slots of all 3 nodes together for rebalancing. This time we have 12 items distributed over 4 slots so the invariant is already met and all we need to do is create a new node to hold them.</p>
<img src="https://peter.horne-khan.com/_astro/figure-9.cmBocD6d_XkTJG.svg" alt="Merging 2 RRB Trees - Part #4" width="1091" height="211" loading="lazy" decoding="async">
<p>This time the new parent node has no siblings to merge with since we’ve reached the top of the tree. As the parent node only contains a single slot the rebalancing process has introduced a redundant level which we simply chop off.</p>
<p>And that’s it! We’ve successfully merged both trees together, ensuring the search step invariant is maintained, while reusing most of the existing nodes.</p>
<p>The implementation is fairly lengthy but there’s nothing especially complex going on:</p>

                 <div><strong><span>CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA</span>&nbsp;</strong>Apple today announced <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFuyX1XgJFg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-analytics-exit-link="">iPhone 16e</a>, a new addition to the iPhone 16 lineup that offers powerful capabilities at a more affordable price. iPhone 16e delivers fast, smooth performance and breakthrough battery life, thanks to the industry-leading efficiency of the A18 chip and the new Apple C1, the first cellular modem designed by Apple. iPhone 16e is also built for Apple Intelligence, the intuitive personal intelligence system that delivers helpful and relevant intelligence while taking an extraordinary step forward for privacy in AI. The 48MP Fusion camera takes gorgeous photos and videos, and with an integrated 2x Telephoto, it is like having two cameras in one, so users can zoom in with optical quality. When outside of cellular and Wi-Fi coverage, Apple’s groundbreaking satellite features — including Emergency SOS, Roadside Assistance, Messages, and Find My via satellite — help iPhone 16e users stay connected and get assistance when it matters most.<sup>1</sup>

                 <div>Apple Intelligence marks an extraordinary step forward for privacy in AI and is designed to protect users’ privacy at every step. It starts with on-device processing, meaning that many of the models that power Apple Inteligence run entirely on device. For requests that require access to larger models, Apple’s groundbreaking Private Cloud Compute extends the privacy and security of iPhone into the cloud to unlock even more intelligence. When using Private Cloud Compute, users’ data is never stored or shared with Apple; it is used only to fulfill their request.

                 <div>The powerful 2-in-1 camera system on iPhone 16e is perfect for capturing everyday moments and important memories, including in Night mode and Portrait mode. Using computational photography, the 48MP Fusion camera takes super-high-resolution photos, so users can capture gorgeous images that balance light and detail. With an integrated 2x Telephoto, users have the equivalent of two cameras in one, and can zoom in with optical quality to get closer to the subject and easily frame their shot. And the front-facing TrueDepth camera with autofocus enables sharper close-ups and beautiful group selfies. The latest generation of HDR captures subjects and the background with true-to-life renderings of skin tones, while ensuring photos have bright highlights, rich mid-tones, and deep shadows.

        <div>iPhone 16e takes stunning videos with the ability to record in 4K with Dolby Vision up to 60 fps, and users can stop and restart a recording for more flexibility when capturing the moment. iPhone 16e also records video in Spatial Audio for immersive listening with AirPods, Apple Vision Pro, or a surround sound system, and enables more ways to edit video sound with Audio Mix. Users can adjust their sound after capture to focus on the voice of the person on camera, make it sound like the video was recorded inside a professional studio, or position vocal tracks in the front and environmental noises in surround sound. With wind noise reduction, powerful ML algorithms automatically reduce unwanted noise for better audio quality.

                 <div>iPhone 16e helps users stay connected and get assistance when it matters most. Apple’s satellite features help users text via satellite when they’re outside of cellular and Wi-Fi coverage. This includes Messages via satellite to text friends and family; Emergency SOS via satellite to connect with emergency services; and Roadside Assistance via satellite to reach a roadside assistance provider in case of car trouble. Users can also use the Find My app to share their location via satellite, reassuring friends and family of their whereabouts while traveling off the grid. Crash Detection on iPhone 16e can detect a severe car crash and automatically dial emergency services if a user is unconscious or unable to reach their iPhone.<sup>5</sup>

</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>iOS 18 makes iPhone 16e more personal, capable, and intelligent than ever.<sup>6</sup> With more customization options, users can give apps and widgets a new dark or tinted look and arrange them in any open space on the Home Screen. The controls at the bottom of the Lock Screen can be customized; Control Center has been redesigned to provide users with easier access to many of the things they use every day, including third-party apps; and new privacy protections include the ability to lock and hide apps to protect sensitive apps and the information inside them. iOS 18 also provides powerful updates for staying connected. In Messages, users can use text effects to bring words, phrases, sentences, and more to life. Tapbacks expand to include emoji, Genmoji, or stickers, and now users can schedule a message to send later. When messaging contacts who do not have an Apple device, the Messages app now supports RCS for richer media and more reliable group messaging when compared to SMS and MMS.

                 <h2><strong>Better for the Environment</strong>
</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>iPhone 16e is designed with the environment in mind. As part of Apple 2030, the company’s ambitious goal to be carbon neutral across its entire carbon footprint by the end of this decade, Apple is transitioning to renewable electricity for its manufacturing, and investing in wind and solar projects around the world to address the electricity used to charge all Apple products, including iPhone 16e. Today, all Apple facilities run on 100 percent renewable electricity — including the data centers that power Apple Intelligence.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>To achieve Apple 2030, the company is designing products with more recycled and renewable materials, which further drives down the carbon footprint. iPhone 16e features over 30 percent recycled content overall, including 100 percent recycled cobalt and 95 percent recycled lithium in the battery, 85 percent recycled aluminum in the enclosure, and more.<sup>7</sup> Additionally, the main logic board and back glass of iPhone 16e are designed to be manufactured more efficiently, reducing the amount of raw materials needed. The packaging is also entirely fiber-based, bringing Apple closer to its goal of removing plastic from its packaging by the end of this year.<sup>8</sup>

    <p data-block-key="685z4">In the pursuit of scientific advances, researchers combine ingenuity and creativity with insight and expertise grounded in literature to generate novel and viable research directions and to guide the exploration that follows. In many fields, this presents a breadth and depth conundrum, since it is challenging to navigate the rapid growth in the rate of scientific publications while integrating insights from unfamiliar domains. Yet overcoming such challenges is critical, as evidenced by the many modern breakthroughs that have emerged from transdisciplinary endeavors. For example, Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna won the <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2020/10/popular-chemistryprize2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry</a> for their work on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CRISPR</a>, which combined expertise ranging from microbiology to genetics to molecular biology.</p><p data-block-key="bngi7">Motivated by unmet needs in the modern scientific discovery process and building on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05530" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent AI advances</a>, including the ability to synthesize across complex subjects and to perform <a href="https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/flash-thinking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">long-term planning and reasoning</a>, we developed an <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/coscientist_paper/ai_coscientist.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AI co-scientist system</a>. The AI co-scientist is a multi-agent AI system that is intended to function as a collaborative tool for scientists. Built on <a href="https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/google-gemini-ai-update-december-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gemini 2.0, AI co-scientist is</a> designed to mirror the reasoning process underpinning the scientific method. Beyond standard literature review, summarization and “deep research” tools, the AI co-scientist system is intended to uncover new, original knowledge and to formulate demonstrably novel research hypotheses and proposals, building upon prior evidence and tailored to specific research objectives.</p>

    </p>



    <p data-block-key="685z4">Given a scientist’s research goal that has been specified in natural language, the AI co-scientist is designed to generate novel research hypotheses, a detailed research overview, and experimental protocols. To do so, it uses a coalition of specialized agents — <i>Generation</i>, <i>Reflection</i>, <i>Ranking</i>, <i>Evolution</i>, <i>Proximity</i> and <i>Meta-review</i> — that are inspired by the scientific method itself. These agents use automated feedback to iteratively generate, evaluate, and refine hypotheses, resulting in a self-improving cycle of increasingly high-quality and novel outputs.</p>

<div>
        
  <p data-block-key="j3yy8">Purpose-built for collaboration, scientists can interact with the system in many ways, including by directly providing their own seed ideas for exploration or by providing feedback on generated outputs in natural language. The AI co-scientist also uses tools, like web-search and specialized AI models, to enhance the grounding and quality of generated hypotheses.</p>

    </div>

                    
                    
    




                    
                    
    


<div>
        
  <p data-block-key="685z4">The AI co-scientist parses the assigned goal into a research plan configuration, managed by a Supervisor agent. The Supervisor agent assigns the specialized agents to the worker queue and allocates resources. This design enables the system to flexibly scale compute and to iteratively improve its scientific reasoning towards the specified research goal.</p>

    <p data-block-key="685z4">The AI co-scientist leverages <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03314" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">test-time compute</a> scaling to iteratively reason, evolve, and improve outputs. Key reasoning steps include <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphago-zero-starting-from-scratch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">self-play</a>–based scientific debate for novel hypothesis generation, ranking tournaments for hypothesis comparison, and an "evolution" process for quality improvement. The system's agentic nature facilitates recursive self-critique, including tool use for feedback to refine hypotheses and proposals.</p><p data-block-key="7ufde">The system's self-improvement relies on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elo</a> auto-evaluation metric derived from its tournaments. Due to their core role, we assessed whether higher Elo ratings correlate with higher output quality. We analyzed the concordance between Elo auto-ratings and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12022" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GPQA benchmark</a> accuracy on its diamond set of challenging questions, and we found that higher Elo ratings positively correlate with a higher probability of correct answers.</p>

<div>
        
  <p data-block-key="685z4">Seven domain experts curated 15 open research goals and best guess solutions in their field of expertise. Using the automated Elo metric we observed that the AI co-scientist outperformed other state-of-the-art agentic and reasoning models for these complex problems. The analysis reproduced the benefits of scaling test-time compute using inductive biases derived from the scientific method. As the system spends more time reasoning and improving, the self-rated quality of results improve and surpass models and unassisted human experts.</p>

<div>
        
  <p data-block-key="685z4">On a smaller subset of 11 research goals, experts assessed the novelty and impact of the AI co-scientist–generated results compared to other relevant baselines; they also provided overall preference. While the sample size was small, experts assessed the AI co-scientist to have higher potential for novelty and impact, and preferred its outputs compared to other models. Further, these human expert preferences also appeared to be concordant with the previously introduced Elo auto-evaluation metric.</p>

    <p data-block-key="685z4">To assess the practical utility of the system’s novel predictions, we evaluated end-to-end laboratory experiments probing the AI co-scientist–generated hypotheses and research proposals in three key biomedical applications: drug repurposing, proposing novel treatment targets, and elucidating the mechanisms underlying antimicrobial resistance.

    <p data-block-key="685z4">Drug development is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eroom%27s_law" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">increasingly time-consuming and expensive process</a> in which new therapeutics require many aspects of the discovery and development process to be restarted for each indication or disease. Drug repurposing addresses this challenge by discovering new therapeutic applications for existing drugs beyond their original intended use. But, due to the complexity of the task, it demands extensive interdisciplinary expertise.</p><p data-block-key="d494o">We applied the AI co-scientist to assist with the prediction of drug repurposing opportunities and, with our partners, validated predictions through computational biology, expert clinician feedback, and <i>in vitro</i> experiments.</p><p data-block-key="18gc5">Notably, the AI co-scientist proposed novel repurposing candidates for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_myeloid_leukemia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">acute myeloid leukemia</a> (AML).

    <p data-block-key="685z4">Identifying novel treatment targets is more complex than drug repurposing, and often leads to inefficient hypothesis selection and poor prioritization for <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> experiments. AI-assisted target discovery helps to streamline the process of experimental validation, potentially helping to reduce development time costs.</p><p data-block-key="8k4au">We probed the AI co-scientist system's ability to propose, rank, and generate hypotheses and experimental protocols for target discovery hypotheses, focusing on <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC546435/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">liver fibrosis</a>. The AI co-scientist demonstrated its potential by identifying epigenetic targets grounded in preclinical evidence with significant anti-fibrotic activity in <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28878125/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">human hepatic organoids</a> (3D, multicellular tissue cultures derived from human cells and designed to mimic the structure and function of the human liver).

    </p>



    <p data-block-key="685z4">As a third validation, we focused on generating hypotheses to explain bacterial gene transfer evolution mechanisms related to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) — microbes' evolved mechanisms to resist infection-treating drugs. This is another complex challenge that involves understanding the molecular mechanisms of gene transfer (<a href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/definition/conjugation-prokaryotes-290/#:~:text=Conjugation%20is%20the%20process%20by,factor%2C%20or%20F%2Dfactor." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">conjugation</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transduction_(genetics)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">transduction</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_transformation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">transformation</a>) alongside the ecological and evolutionary pressures that drive AMR genes to spread.</p><p data-block-key="9a67g">For this test, expert researchers instructed the AI co-scientist to explore a topic that had already been subject to novel discovery in their group, but had not yet been revealed in the public domain, namely, to explain how <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36596306/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">capsid-forming phage-inducible chromosomal islands</a> (cf-PICIs) exist across multiple bacterial species. The AI co-scientist system independently proposed that cf-PICIs interact with diverse phage tails to expand their host range. This<i> in silico</i> discovery, which had been experimentally validated in the original novel laboratory experiments performed prior to use of the AI co-scientist system, are described in co-timed manuscripts (<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.11.637232v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a>, <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/coscientist_paper/penades2025ai.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2</a>) with our collaborators at the Fleming Initiative and Imperial College London.

    <p data-block-key="685z4">In our report we address several limitations of the system and opportunities for improvement, including enhanced literature reviews, factuality checking, cross-checks with external tools, auto-evaluation techniques, and larger-scale evaluation involving more subject matter experts with varied research goals. The AI co-scientist represents a promising advance toward AI-assisted technologies for scientists to help accelerate discovery. Its ability to generate novel, testable hypotheses across diverse scientific and biomedical domains — some already validated experimentally — and its capacity for recursive self-improvement with increased compute, demonstrate its potential to accelerate scientists' efforts to address grand challenges in science and medicine. We look forward to responsible exploration of the potential of the AI co-scientist as an assistive tool for scientists. This project illustrates how collaborative and human-centred AI systems might be able to augment human ingenuity and accelerate scientific discovery.</p>

<hr></span></section><section><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p><span>Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) has observed increasing efforts from several Russia state-aligned threat actors to compromise Signal Messenger accounts used by individuals of interest to Russia's intelligence services. While this emerging operational interest has likely been sparked by wartime demands to gain access to sensitive government and military communications in the context of Russia's re-invasion of Ukraine, we anticipate the tactics and methods used to target Signal will grow in prevalence in the near-term and proliferate to additional threat actors and regions outside the Ukrainian theater of war.</span></p>
<p><span>Signal's popularity among common targets of surveillance and espionage activity—such as military personnel, politicians, journalists, activists, and other at-risk communities—has positioned the secure messaging application as a high-value target for adversaries seeking to intercept sensitive information that could fulfil a range of different intelligence requirements. More broadly, this threat also extends to other popular messaging applications such as WhatsApp and Telegram, which are also being actively targeted by Russian-aligned threat groups using similar techniques. In anticipation of a wider adoption of similar tradecraft by other threat actors, we are issuing a public warning regarding the tactics and methods used to date to help build public awareness and help communities better safeguard themselves from similar threats.</span></p>
<p><span><span>We are grateful to the team at Signal for their close partnership in investigating this activity. The latest Signal releases on </span><a href="https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/commit/112874c08019a40b6f8f1dbbf84eb0ab4d796582" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Android</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-iOS/commit/498b97033254c514404345efc1d4c29c1b076f6c" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>iOS</span></a><span> contain hardened features designed to help protect against similar phishing campaigns in the future. </span><a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007059212-How-do-I-ensure-Signal-is-up-to-date" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Update</span></a><span> to the latest version to enable these features.</span></span></p></span></section><section><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><h2><span>Phishing Campaigns Abusing Signal's "Linked Devices" Feature</span></h2>
<p><span>The most novel and widely used technique underpinning Russian-aligned attempts to compromise Signal accounts is the abuse of the app's legitimate "</span><a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007320551-Linked-Devices" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>linked devices</span></a><span>" feature that enables Signal to be used on multiple devices concurrently. Because linking an additional device typically requires scanning a quick-response (QR) code, threat actors have resorted to crafting malicious QR codes that, when scanned, will link a victim's account to an actor-controlled Signal instance. If successful, future messages will be delivered synchronously to both the victim and the threat actor in real-time, providing a persistent means to eavesdrop on the victim's secure conversations without the need for full-device compromise.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>In remote phishing operations observed to date, malicious QR codes have frequently been masked as legitimate Signal resources, such as group invites, security alerts, or as legitimate device pairing instructions from the Signal website.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>In more tailored remote phishing operations, malicious device-linking QR codes have been embedded in phishing pages crafted to appear as specialized applications used by the Ukrainian military.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Beyond remote phishing and malware delivery operations, we have also seen malicious QR codes being used in close-access operations. </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/apt44-unearthing-sandworm"><span>APT44</span></a><span> (aka Sandworm or Seashell Blizzard, a threat actor attributed by </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/six-russian-gru-officers-charged-connection-worldwide-deployment-destructive-malware-and" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>multiple</span></a><span> governments to the Main Centre for Special Technologies (GTsST) within Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (GU), known commonly as the GRU) has worked to enable forward-deployed Russian military forces to link Signal accounts on devices captured on the battlefield back to actor-controlled infrastructure for follow-on exploitation.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Notably, this device-linking concept of operations has proven to be a low-signature form of initial access due to the lack of centralized, technology-driven detections and defenses that can be used to monitor for account compromise via newly linked devices; when successful, there is a high risk that a compromise can go unnoticed for extended periods of time.</span></p>
<h2><span>UNC5792: Modified Signal Group Invites</span></h2>
<p><span>To compromise Signal accounts using the device-linking feature, one suspected Russian espionage cluster tracked as UNC5792 (which partially overlaps with CERT-UA's </span><a href="https://cert.gov.ua/article/6278735" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>UAC-0195</span></a><span>) has altered legitimate "</span><a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360051086971-Group-Link-or-QR-code" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>group invite</span></a><span>" pages for delivery in phishing campaigns, replacing the expected redirection to a Signal group with a redirection to a malicious URL crafted to link an actor-controlled device to the victim's Signal account.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>In these operations, UNC5792 has hosted modified Signal group invitations on actor-controlled infrastructure designed to appear identical to a legitimate Signal group invite.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>In each of the fake group invites, JavaScript code that typically redirects the user to join a Signal group has been replaced by a malicious block containing the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) used by Signal to link a new device to Signal (i.e., "sgnl://linkdevice?uuid="), tricking victims into linking their Signal accounts to a device controlled by UNC5792.</span></p>

The group operates a tailored Signal phishing kit designed to mimic components of the </span><a href="https://united24media.com/war-in-ukraine/ukraines-secret-weapon-kropyva-software-4026#:~:text=Kropyva's%20impact&amp;text=Amongst%20the%20Ukrainian%20Armed%20Forces,applications%20across%20Ukraine's%20armed%20forces." rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Kropyva</span></a><span> application used by the Armed Forces of Ukraine for artillery guidance. Similar to the social engineering approach used by UNC5792, UNC4221 has also attempted to mask its device-linking functionality as an invite to a Signal group from a trusted contact. Different variations of this phishing kit have been observed, including:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Phishing websites that redirect victims to secondary phishing infrastructure masquerading as legitimate device-linking instructions provisioned by Signal (Figure 4)</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Phishing websites with the malicious device-linking QR code directly embedded into the primary Kropyva-themed phishing kit (Figure 5)</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>In earlier operations in 2022, UNC4221 phishing pages were crafted to appear as a legitimate security alert from Signal (Figure 6)</span></p>

<h2><span>Wider Russian and Belarusian Efforts to Steal Messages From Signal</span></h2>
<p><span>Beyond targeted efforts to link additional actor-controlled devices to victim Signal accounts, multiple known and established regional threat actors have also been observed operating capabilities designed to steal Signal database files from Android and Windows devices.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>APT44 has been observed operating WAVESIGN, a lightweight Windows Batch script, to periodically query Signal messages from a victim's Signal database and exfiltrate those most recent messages using Rclone (Figure 7).</span></p>

<p><span>The operational emphasis on Signal from multiple threat actors in recent months serves as an important warning for the growing threat to secure messaging applications that is certain to intensify in the near-term. When placed in a wider context with other trends in the threat landscape, such as the growing commercial spyware industry and the surge of mobile malware variants being leveraged in active conflict zones, there appears to be a clear and growing demand for offensive cyber capabilities that can be used to monitor the sensitive communications of individuals who rely on secure messaging applications to safeguard their online activity.</span></p>
<p><span>As reflected in wide ranging efforts to compromise Signal accounts, this threat to secure messaging applications is not limited to remote cyber operations such as phishing and malware delivery, but also critically includes close-access operations where a threat actor can secure brief access to a target's unlocked device. Equally important, this threat is not only limited to Signal, but also extends to other widely used messaging platforms, including WhatsApp and Telegram, which have likewise factored into the targeting priorities of several of the aforementioned Russia-aligned groups in recent months. For an example of this wider targeting interest, see Microsoft Threat Intelligence's </span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/01/16/new-star-blizzard-spear-phishing-campaign-targets-whatsapp-accounts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>recent blog post</span></a><span> on a COLDRIVER (aka UNC4057 and Star Blizzard) campaign attempting to abuse the linked device feature to compromise WhatsApp accounts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Potential targets of government-backed intrusion activity targeting their personal devices should adopt practices to help safeguard themselves, including:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Enable </span><a href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/9079129?hl=en" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>screen lock</span></a><span> on all mobile devices using a long, complex password with a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Android supports alphanumeric passwords, which offer significantly more security than numeric-only PINs or patterns.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Install operating system updates as soon as possible and always use the latest version of Signal and other messaging apps.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Ensure </span><a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2812853?hl=en" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Google Play Protect</span></a><span> is enabled, which is on by default on Android devices with Google Play Services. Google Play Protect checks your apps and devices for harmful behavior and can warn users or block apps known to exhibit malicious behavior, even when those apps come from sources outside of Play.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Audit linked devices regularly for unauthorized devices by navigating to the "Linked devices" section in the application's settings.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Exercise caution when interacting with QR codes and web resources purporting to be software updates, group invites, or other notifications that appear legitimate and urge immediate action.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>If available, use two-factor authentication such as fingerprint, facial recognition, a security key, or a one-time code to verify when your account is logged into or linked to a new device.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>iPhone users concerned about targeted surveillance or espionage activity should consider enabling </span><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/iphone/iph049680987/ios" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Lockdown Mode</span></a><span> to reduce their attack surface.</span></p>
