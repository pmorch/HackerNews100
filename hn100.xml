<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>DriveBC's Twitter account maxed out sharing crucial road condition information during a weekend of wildfire evacuations. Experts say it spells the end of social media as a reliable platform during an emergency.</p><div id="details-body" data-words="1143" itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>A B.C. government Twitter account updating residents about driving conditions reached its tweet limit on a weekend it&nbsp;was sharing information about&nbsp;wildfire evacuations.</p>

<p>The incident, which occurred earlier this month, prompted the Ministry of Transportation’s DriveBC account to issue a warning.</p>

<p>“HEADS UP - As many others have this weekend, <a href="https://twitter.com/DriveBC/status/1675600911782256640" target="_blank">@DriveBC</a> on Twitter and its sub accounts have exceeded the temporarily imposed post rate limit,” tweeted the ministry account July 2.</p>

<p>“We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, and appreciate your patience while we work to resolve this issue going forward.”</p>

<p>The outage, first reported by CBC News, lasted little more than an hour but nevertheless has worried emergency preparedness experts, who say it's the&nbsp;latest sign that the&nbsp;once-reliable platform can no longer be counted on.</p>

<p>“It's kind of the end of public alerting through social media,” said Ryan Reynolds, an emergency preparedness consultant with Resilience Mapping Canada.</p>

<p>“These limits basically mean that we can't distribute that information quickly and easily at any scale.”</p>

<p>DriveBC has a dedicated <a href="https://drivebc.ca/" target="_blank">website</a>, but many access its automated messages through its Twitter account, a platform accessed by more than a quarter of Canadians in 2023, according to the company’s <a href="https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2023-canada" target="_blank">advertising data</a>.</p>

<p>In the past, Twitter’s more than 370 million&nbsp;users have accessed the platform&nbsp;as a last bastion of critical information during social upheavals and disaster. It played a crucial role redirecting Pakistanis to a Red Crescent emergency help line during massive floods in 2022, and amplified emergency service information when Hurricane Ian struck Florida last September.</p>

<p>Since Elon Musk’s takeover of the platform, however, Twitter has put new rules in place that limit the number of automated tweets an account can send without paying. The move was carried out partly as a response to rising concerns artificial intelligence platforms would use the historical archives of social media platforms to train their large language models.</p>

<p>“We've been trying to use private infrastructure as public infrastructure for communications,” said Reynolds. “But it really doesn't work once things change.”</p>

<p>“We need to acknowledge that we still want to be where everyone is (so on social media), but we also need fallbacks that are much more reliable.”</p>

<h3>Other jurisdictions feeling pinch of Twitter’s new limits</h3>

<p>B.C. is far from the first jurisdiction to feel the effects of recent tweet limits. The U.S. National Weather Service uses Twitter to share hurricane and tornado alerts. But on July 4, its Boulder, Colo., bureau tweeted that rate limits meant it was unable to sift through tweets during active severe weather events.</p>

<p>“Due to issues with Twitter rate limits, we are unable to access most tweets at this time,” said NWS Boulder.</p>

<p>“Send reports to our other social media accounts or direct through our email/phone lines.”</p>

<p>Similar warnings were posted to the weather service’s bureaus in <a href="https://twitter.com/NWSWilmingtonNC/status/1675570926350651392?s=20" target="_blank">North Carolina</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/NWSWakefieldVA/status/1675258587206275073" target="_blank">Virginia</a>.</p>

<p>Some agencies have responded by cutting off their use of Twitter as a source of critical information. Last week, Dutch politicians told <a href="https://www.rappler.com/technology/social-media/twitter-not-suited-emergency-communications-dutch-say/" target="_blank">Reuters</a> Twitter had become an unreliable platform after the Netherlands’ most intense summer storm on record ripped through North Holland.</p>

<p>In New York, the <a href="https://new.mta.info/press-release/statement-mta-acting-chief-customer-shanifah-rieara-suspending-use-of-twitter-service" target="_blank">Metropolitan Transportation Authority</a> said in April it would suspend use of the platform for service alerts after it was twice locked out of the platform’s Application Programming Interface (API).</p>

<p>“The MTA has terminated posting service information to Twitter, effective immediately, as the reliability of the platform can no longer be guaranteed,” said North America’s largest transportation authority in a press release.</p>

<p>"The MTA does not pay tech platforms to publish service information and has built redundant tools that provide service alerts in real time.”</p>

<h3>Big disasters in big cities present&nbsp;largest risk</h3>

<p>Twitter’s API service limits tweets for non-paying users to 1,500 a month — not enough for many emergency accounts. And while a&nbsp;small fee for the platform's 'Blue Check' service will increase that ceiling for individual users, the cost of an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/21/23691784/elon-musk-twitter-disaster-alert-accounts-fire-storm-tsunami-earthquake" target="_blank">enterprise account</a> has reportedly climbed into the tens of thousands of dollars.</p>

<p>Twitter did not respond to Glacier Media's questions.</p>

<p>Reynolds says Twitter's recent posting limits will likely have a limited effect on communication during emergency events in smaller communities, simply because they are less likely to send out as many tweets.</p>

<p>But he worries what might happen during a major disaster, such as a powerful earthquake striking large population centres in Metro Vancouver or the Capital Regional District on southern Vancouver Island.</p>

<p>“For a place like say Metro Vancouver, that's going to be a very different story, where you're seeing potentially very large number of messages going out during an emergency,” Reynolds said.</p>

<p>Like many government information services, <a href="https://drivebc.ca/" target="_blank">DriveBC</a> and the <a href="https://wildfiresituation.nrs.gov.bc.ca/map" target="_blank">BC Wildfire Service</a> share information on their own websites. But Reynolds worries whether such websites could handle the surge in traffic should a disaster occur in a major population centre.</p>

<p>“That's the official way to get that message out,” he said of the websites. “It has to be bulletproof and support that messaging, but I'm not convinced that that's the case right now. There aren't really good alternatives yet.”</p>

<p>A spokesperson from Metro Vancouver said it plans to use a number of communication platforms to inform residents in an emergency — including the app <a href="https://alertable.ca/#/" target="_blank">Alertable</a>.</p>

<p>“Metro Vancouver is active on social media, but doesn’t rely on any one platform or method to get important information out during an emergency,” said the spokesperson.</p>

<p>The B.C.'s Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure was not immediately available for comment.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Government playing catch-up with 'tech bros'</h3>

<p>Reynolds says he's worried regional, provincial and federal governments aren't taking household disaster preparedness seriously enough.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A former researcher at the University of British Columbia, Reynolds led the development of an <a href="https://www.nsnews.com/highlights/disaster-app-helps-bc-communities-plan-for-climate-fallout-4695240" target="_blank">emergency app</a> to prepare and warn British Columbians of everything from floods to tsunamis and fires.</p>

<p>Initially rolled out in seven communities on Vancouver Island, Reynolds planned to scale up the app across B.C. But the province turned down two of his grant applications and he says the project, developed after years of community-level research, will become “dead” unless&nbsp;Public Safety Canada picks it up.</p>

<p>“That's a concern for me,” he said. “We need to have either a Canadian alerting app that is send only — the part of Twitter that we need for emergency management — or we need to reinforce the alternative approaches.”</p>

<p>Reynolds said that could come through partnering with the U.S. and Mexico or even NATO so Canada doesn’t have to “reinvent the wheel.”</p>

<p>In the meantime, apps like <a href="https://www.alertready.ca/" target="_blank">Alert Ready</a> offer a good option to receive emergency alerts, but they have their limits when it comes to preparing households beforehand, said Reynolds.</p>

<p>“We're losing these other passive solutions. We don't really have a great replacement for them right now,” he said. “This is just the privatization of social media, and the kind of balkanization of social media that we weren't anticipating.”</p>

<p>“Emergency management moves at a much slower rate than tech bros.”</p>

Indy UNIX workstation. The player controls a monster to blow up a city. The
author dedicated a
<a href="https://www.evl.uic.edu/aej/AndyBattalion.html">website</a> to the
game.</p>

<p>Depending on the perspective, the controls are a little awkward. You may
want to change the camera with key <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>,
<code>3</code>, or <code>4</code>. Use the mouse to rotate and to move
forward/backward. The arrow keys only work if the mouse cursor is placed in the
center of the screen. Shoot with the left control key or the left mouse button,
and tilt the head with <code>A</code> and <code>Z</code> to target helicopters
and jets. The camera can be rotated with <code>I</code>, <code>J</code>,
<code>K</code>, and <code>L</code>. Alter the rendering details with
<code>D</code>. Press <code>G</code> to grab the mouse cursor and
<code>P</code> to pause the game.</p>

<p>In a letter to the heads of <span><a href="https://apnews.com/hub/internal-revenue-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the IRS</a></span>, the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission and the IRS watchdog, seven lawmakers say their findings “reveal a shocking breach of taxpayer privacy by tax prep companies and by Big Tech firms.” </p><p>Their report said highly personal and financial information about sources of taxpayers’ income, tax deductions and exemptions was made accessible to Meta as taxpayers used the tax software to prepare their taxes.</p>

<p>That data came to Meta through its Pixel code, which the tax firms installed on their websites to gather information on how to improve their own marketing campaigns. In exchange, Meta was able to access the data to write targeted algorithms for its own users. </p><p>The program collected information on taxpayers’ filing status, income, refund amounts, names of dependents, approximate federal tax owed, which buttons were clicked on the tax preparers’ websites and the names of text entry forms that the taxpayer navigated, the report states. </p><p>Taxpayer data was also shared with Google, through its own tracking tools — though the firm told lawmakers that it never used the information to track users on the internet, according to the report. </p><p>The letter to federal agencies was signed by Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Ron Wyden, Richard Blumenthal, Tammy Duckworth, Bernie Sanders, Sheldon Whitehouse and Rep. Katie Porter. The lawmakers called for the agencies to “immediately open an investigation into this incident.”</p>
    

<p>They ask the agencies to investigate “and prosecute any company or individuals who violated the law,” saying it could result in billions of dollars in criminal liability to the firms.</p><p>The Markup, a nonprofit journalism outlet focusing on technology, <span><a href="https://themarkup.org/pixel-hunt/2022/11/22/tax-filing-websites-have-been-sending-users-financial-information-to-facebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener">initially reported</a></span> on the data-sharing between tax firms and Meta in November. A TaxAct representative said the firm has engaged with Warren’s office to explain its usage of the analytical tools and that protecting customers is its top priority. </p><p>A TaxSlayer representative said Wednesday that the report “contains numerous false or misleading statements” regarding the taxpayers’ personal and filing information sent to Meta and Google and it will request a retraction or correction from Warren’s office. </p><p>H&amp;R Block said that it takes protecting client privacy very seriously and has taken steps to prevent the sharing of information through the Pixel coding.</p><p>And Meta said that it has been clear in its policies that advertisers “should not send sensitive information about people through our Business Tools.”</p><p>“Doing so is against our policies and we educate advertisers on properly setting up Business tools to prevent this from occurring,” the company said in an emailed statement. “Our system is designed to filter out potentially sensitive data it is able to detect.”</p>
    

<p>Meta’s Facebook has a history of failure when it comes to protecting user privacy. </p><p>One of its <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/e0e0df2083fe40c0b0ad10ff1946f041" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biggest scandals erupted in 2018 when investigations revealed that Cambridge Analytica,</a></span> a firm with ties to Donald Trump’s onetime political strategist Steve Bannon, had paid a Facebook app developer for access to the personal information of about 87 million Facebook users. That data was then used to target U.S. voters during the 2016 campaign that culminated in Trump’s election as the 45th president.</p><p>Facebook agreed to a $725 million user settlement in that case, and later was <span><a href="https://apnews.com/general-news-7fa2c8a26b34436d89a1c7aff9914f70" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fined $5 billion</a></span> by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>This May, the FTC proposed <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/facebook-kids-messenger-ftc-privacy-children-6158aa59dee25c473e49f7df16f502ec" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sweeping new changes</a></span> to its standing privacy order for Meta that would bar the company from using any data collected from children under 18, including via its virtual reality technologies. The new rules would also force Meta to pause new products and services until an independent assessor confirms that they comply with the FTC order. The under-18 concerns stem largely from Facebook’s Messenger for Kids app, which has long drawn fire for insufficient privacy protections for its younger users.</p><p>Also in 2018, the company disclosed that <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/65986276c04449ffb3e795ce0eef29d4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost 50 million accounts</a></span> had been vulnerable to the theft of digital “user tokens” that attackers could use to log into personal accounts. Facebook admitted the same year that most of its then 2.2 billion users had likely had their <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/4c5ee5ee573846b68e13e6c3a77b01bf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public data “scraped” by malicious actors</a></span>.</p><p>Representatives from the IRS and FTC did not immediately respond to requests for comment. DOJ and the IRS watchdog declined to comment. </p>
    

<p>The Democrats say their report serves as an argument for the creation of <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/irs-income-tax-free-electronic-filing-option-700e54251a39791091966bc0b356d342" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an electronic free-file system</a></span> for submitting tax returns that would be run by the government, which the IRS is currently piloting. </p><p>The IRS plans to launch a pilot program for the 2024 filing season to test a “direct file” system and help the federal government decide whether to move forward with potentially implementing it in the future.</p><p>The IRS in May published <span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p5788.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a feasibility report</a></span> laying out taxpayer interest in direct file, how the system could work, its potential cost, operational challenges and more.</p><p>The report shows that the majority of surveyed taxpayers would be interested in using an IRS-provided tool to prepare and file their taxes electronically — almost 50% of respondents who preferred the IRS free-file option over commercial tax preparation firms said they preferred to give their financial information directly to the IRS instead of the third party. </p><h2>___</h2><p>AP writer David Hamilton in San Francisco contributed to this report. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-body">
<p>Today, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) has added 802.11bb as a standard for light-based wireless communications. The publishing of the standard has been <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230712214664/en/Global-LiFi-Firms-Welcome-the-Release-of-IEEE-802.11bb-Global-Light-Communications-Standard" data-url="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230712214664/en/Global-LiFi-Firms-Welcome-the-Release-of-IEEE-802.11bb-Global-Light-Communications-Standard">welcomed</a> by global Li-Fi businesses, as it will help speed the rollout and adoption of the &nbsp;data-transmission technology standard.</p><p>Advantages of using light rather than radio frequencies (RF) are highlighted by Li-Fi proponents including pureLiFi, Fraunhofer HHI, and the Light Communications 802.11bb Task Group. Li-Fi is said to deliver “faster, more reliable wireless communications with unparalleled security compared to conventional technologies such as Wi-Fi and 5G.” Now that the IEEE 802.11bb Li-Fi standard has been released, it is hoped that interoperability between Li-Fi systems with the successful Wi-Fi will be fully addressed.</p><p>Of course, Li-Fi isn’t going to sweep away Wi-Fi and 5G alternatives (nor wired networks). Radio waves still have a distinct advantage with regard to transmission through the atmosphere at great distance, and though opaque objects. Instead, work must concentrate on using horses for courses – with Li-Fi advantages being harvested where possible.</p><div data-nosnippet=""><p><iframe data-lazy-priority="high" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kDqA1-ldTOI" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div><p>In the Fraunhofer HHI video above you can see a Li-Fi system re-using a building’s lighting infrastructure for data. Don’t worry, the lights don’t visibly blink or flash, as the data transmission uses part of the infrared spectrum.</p><p>Where Li-Fi shines (pun intended) is not just in its purported speeds <a href="https://lifi.co/lifi-speed/" data-url="https://lifi.co/lifi-speed/">as fast as 224 GB/s</a>. Fraunhofer’s Dominic Schulz points out that as it works in an exclusive optical spectrum, this ensures higher reliability and lower latency and jitter. Moreover “Light’s line-of-sight propagation enhances security by preventing wall penetration, reducing jamming and eavesdropping risks, and enabling centimetre-precision indoor navigation,” says Shultz.</p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check=""><div><p><picture><source type="image/webp" alt="pureLiFi Light Antenna ONE module" onerror="if(this.src &amp;&amp; this.src.indexOf('missing-image.svg') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)" data-normal="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/tomshardware/media/img/missing-image.svg" data-srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4-320-80.jpg.webp 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4-480-80.jpg.webp 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4-650-80.jpg.webp 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4-970-80.jpg.webp 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4-1024-80.jpg.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4-1200-80.jpg.webp 1200w" data-sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4.jpg"><source type="image/jpeg" alt="pureLiFi Light Antenna ONE module" onerror="if(this.src &amp;&amp; this.src.indexOf('missing-image.svg') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)" data-normal="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/tomshardware/media/img/missing-image.svg" data-srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4-1200-80.jpg 1200w" data-sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4.jpg" alt="pureLiFi Light Antenna ONE module" onerror="if(this.src &amp;&amp; this.src.indexOf('missing-image.svg') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)" data-normal="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/tomshardware/media/img/missing-image.svg" data-srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4-1200-80.jpg 1200w" data-sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4.jpg" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59Vxt7JgAzAXun92orxpS4-1200-80.jpg 1200w"></picture></p></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description"><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: pureLiFi)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Now the IEEE 802.11bb standard is published, manufacturers can have greater confidence in the ecosystem and start integrating the tech, where suitable.

<p>Topics to look for in the coming months include: </p>
<ul>
	<li><span>Weaknesses on the Cusp</span> — Weaknesses that did not make the 2023 CWE Top 25 of which you should be aware.</li>
	<li><span>Trends in Real-World CWEs: 2019 to 2023</span> — A discussion of overall trends and what it means for your IT infrastructure.</li>
	<li><span>Actively Exploited</span> — Ranking weaknesses by CISA’s KEV Catalog.</li>
	<li><span>CWEs and Root-Cause Mapping</span> — The path to clarifying sources of vulnerabilities as we as a community work to eradicate vulnerabilities from your IT infrastructure.</li>

<p>General availability of GitHub’s merge queue means good-bye to traffic jams on your team’s busiest branches. No more rushing to merge your pull requests before someone else merges theirs 🥵. Turn on GitHub’s merge queue today and accelerate your merge velocity 🚀.</p>
<p>Any team that is part of a managed organization with public repositories and GitHub Enterprise Cloud users will be able to enable this feature on their respective repository and start streamlining their team’s pull requests immediately. If this describes you, then let the commit parties commence 🎉.</p>
<h2 id="introducing-merge-queue-our-newest-feature-to-improve-team-velocity">Introducing merge queue: our newest feature to improve team velocity<a href="#introducing-merge-queue-our-newest-feature-to-improve-team-velocity" aria-label="Introducing merge queue: our newest feature to improve team velocity"></a></h2>
<p>Collaborative coding is powerful. But to be at your team’s most optimized state, you need automated branch management that enables multiple developers to commit code on a daily basis, without frustration. This can happen if your team’s branch is busy with many team members onboarding the same commit onramp. This can be frustrating for your team, but, more importantly, it gets in the way of shipping velocity.&nbsp; We don’t want that journey for you!</p>
<p>This is why we built merge queue. We’ve reduced the tension between branch stability and velocity. Merge queue takes care of making sure your pull request is compatible with other changes ahead of it and alerting you if something goes wrong. The result: your team can focus on the good stuff—write, submit, and commit.&nbsp; No tool sprawls here. This flow is still in the same place with the enablement of a modified merge button because GitHub remains your one-stop-shop for an integrated, enterprise-ready platform with the industry’s best collaboration tools.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-merge-queue-work">How does merge queue work?<a href="#how-does-merge-queue-work" aria-label="How does merge queue work?"></a></h2>

<p>Merge queue is designed for high-performance teams where multiple users regularly commit to a single branch. Prior to merge queue, engineers would need to attempt to merge directly onto an already busy branch—potentially running into code conflicts, and then spiraling into a cycle of rework.</p>
<p>With GitHub’s merge queue, a temporary branch is created that contains:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">The latest changes from the base branch</li>
<li aria-level="1">The changes from other pull requests already in the queue</li>
<li aria-level="1">The changes from your pull request</li>
</ul>
<p>CI then starts, with the expectation that all required status checks must pass before the branch (and the pull requests it represents) are merged. Merge queue is the ultimate branch traffic controller.</p>
<p>We’re thrilled that Block, one of our enterprise customers, has been unlocking the magic of this streamlined workflow–queue-then-next-play.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>We would routinely experience post-merge build failures in our monorepo several times a week and merge queue has practically eliminated all build failures in that category. This has greatly reduced our on-call burden and lessened the friction our developers’ experience during their daily workflows.</p></blockquote><figcaption> - Jon Graves, Engineering Manager at Block Inc</figcaption></figure>

<p>Enhance your team’s performance and speed by enabling this new branch protection.</p>
<p>As a repository administrator:</p>
<ul>
<li>For your target branch, <strong>enable the branch protection setting</strong>, “Require merge queue.”</li>
<li><strong>Set your preferences</strong> for the merge queue: merge method, build on currency, merge limits, only merge non-failing pull requests, status check timeout.</li>
</ul>
<p>As an engineer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the pull request to be added to the queue, click ‘<strong>Merge when ready’</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>To view the merge queue, from the branches page for the repository, <strong>click on the ‘pull requests queued to merge’ link</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>If a merge fails, the pull request will be removed from the queue and a notification sent to the author of the pull request to check. For more information about how to access and set up the merge queue for a branch in your repository, check out our <a href="https://docs.github.com/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/managing-a-merge-queue">docs</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Get started now by enabling this new branch protection for your team with GitHub merge queue.</strong> It’s your team’s path to less branch traffic jams and more time where it matters–efficient collaboration for more coding!</p>

<p>We’ve all come across a LEGO set from childhood and felt the temptation to try building it one more time — making the generous assumption, of course, that all the pieces are in the box, to say nothing of the instructions. If you’re missing a few bricks, you can always turn to the robust secondary market in LEGO components. If you’re missing the manual, there’s now one place you should look first: <a href="https://archive.org/details/lego-set-instructions?utm_source=join1440&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;sort=-week&amp;page=4">the LEGO building instructions collection at the Internet Archive</a>. There you’ll find digitized materials for more than 6,800 different sets, including such popular releases as the <a href="https://archive.org/details/lego-building-instructions-10304">LEGO Chevrolet Camaro Z28</a>, the <a href="https://archive.org/details/lego-building-instructions-21321/21321_A_Digital%20Booklet%20-%20DE/">LEGO International Space Station</a>, and the <a href="https://archive.org/details/lego-building-instructions-31198">LEGO cover photo of <em>Meet the Beatles</em></a>.</p>

<p>Since they were first brought to market in the late nineteen-fifties, LEGO’s signature building bricks have been primarily considered children’s toys. And of course, most of us got to know LEGO in childhood; I myself have fond memories of working my way up to the <a href="https://ramblingbrick.com/2021/02/14/an-ice-place-to-be-revisiting-ice-planet-2002/">Ice Planet 2002 series</a>, with its still much-referenced transparent orange chainsaws.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.metafilter.com/199906/LEGO-Building-Instructions">The Metafilter discussion of the Internet Archive’s LEGO building instructions collection</a> reveals not only that some are excited indeed about the existence of this resource, but also that others consider building from instructions to be a misuse of the medium. It may be true that following specific documented steps for hours on end may encourage a certain slackening of the imagination. But then, it may also be true that physically working one’s way through a complex assembly process can build dexterity and generate ideas for later freeform constructions. However we approach LEGO, and whatever age at which we approach it, we need only keep in mind the Danish imperative that gave the company its name: <em>leg godt </em>— play well. Enter the collection of instructions here.</p>

The FTC has gone after individual companies; it recently <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ftc-alleges-amazon-duped-customers-into-prime-subscriptions-2023-6" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">sued</a> Amazon, alleging the etailer "tricked" people into signing up for Amazon Prime.&nbsp;</p><p>That followed the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/03/federal-trade-commission-proposes-rule-provision-making-it-easier-consumers-click-cancel-recurring" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">FTC's proposal</a> in March for a regulation that's intended "to make it as easy for consumers to cancel their enrollment as it was to sign up." The policy would cover providers of both digital and physical subscriptions, from streamers and gym memberships to phone companies and cable TV distributors.</p><p>The new rule would require companies to offer a simple mechanism for users to cancel subscriptions the same way they signed up. For example, you wouldn't have to cancel a service in person or over the phone if you signed up for it online.</p><p>"I can't tell you how much time I've spent trying to cancel subscriptions I never wanted, let alone the cost!" one person wrote in a <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document/FTC-2023-0033-0001/comment" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">comment</a> to the FTC.&nbsp;</p><p>The proposal comes at a precarious time for the entertainment industry. Hollywood distributors are counting on streaming to save them from the decline of the cable bundle. But the model depends on getting more subscribers to join and stay, and consumers have become trained to frequently cancel their subscriptions.</p><p>The average monthly churn rate across 10 subscription video streamers reached 5.8% in 2022, up from 3.2% in 2019, according to <a href="https://www.antenna.live/post/antenna-q3-2022-svod-growth-report-as-the-world-churns" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">data analytics firm Antenna</a>.

Discovery <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/warner-bros-discovery-streaming-cmo-reveals-launch-strategy-max-2023-4" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">emphasized new features</a> built into the app to keep people from canceling.</p><p>And entertainment trade orgs are fighting the FTC's proposal, submitting comments to the FTC ahead of its June 23 deadline for public comment.&nbsp;</p><p>The Internet &amp; Television Association, which counts Disney, Paramount, and Warner Bros. Discovery as <a href="https://www.ncta.com/our-members" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow">members</a>, said in its public comment that the proposed reg is so vague, it would lead marketers to be excessive in their disclosures, leaving consumers "inundated" and "confused." The reg would even infringe on its members' freedom of speech, the association argued.&nbsp;</p><p>"The proposal would also severely curtail or, in some cases, even prohibit companies from communicating with their customers, in violation of the First Amendment," the association wrote.</p><p>Sirius XM wrote in its comments that one proposed requirement — that companies maintain records of phone calls with customers — would cost the company "several million" dollars a year to comply with.</p><p>The Entertainment Software Association, the video gaming trade organization, noted that the FTC's proposed disclosure requirements "would interfere with game play and customer enjoyment." The ESA wrote that "most consumers understand autorenewal offers and are knowing and willing participants in the marketplace" and that letting customers cancel immediately would prevent member companies from offering them alternative plans or discounts. The ESA was joined in its comments by the Digital Media Association and Motion Picture Association, whose members include Netflix, Sony Pictures Entertainment, and Universal Pictures.</p><p>The FTC will examine the feedback it's received through public comment before considering a final rule.</p>

<!-- intro -->

        <h2 id="intro">What's dt? <a href="#intro">⌾</a></h2>
        <p>
          dt is a utility and programming language. The utility is intended for
          ergonomic in-the-shell execution. The language is straightforward
          (in the most literal sense) with a minimal syntax that allows for
          high-level, higher-order programming.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's meant to supplement (<i>not replace!</i>) other tools like awk,
          sed, xargs, and shell built-ins. Something like the Perl one-liners
          popular yesteryear, but hopefully easier to read and reason through.
        </p>
        <p>
          In particular dt is intended to be generally useful, with zero
          pretense of elegance. The philosophy might be summed up with some
          <a href="https://www.redgreen.com/">Red Green</a> quotes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>If it ain't broke, you're not trying.</li>
          <li>...the handyman's secret weapon, duct tape.</li>
          <li>This is only temporary, unless it works.</li>
          <li>Spare the duct tape, spoil the job.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          dt is released as open source software, usable under the (permissive)
          terms of <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause">
          the BSD 3-Clause license</a>.
        </p>

        <h4>Excuse me, is it "duct" or "duck" tape?</h4>
        <p>
          I mean sure, "duct tape" and "duck tape" are both fine. "Duct tape"
          is the more common name today. The older name is "duck tape" after
          the duck cloth under the adhesive.
        </p>
        <p><i>
          As an aside: If you care about such things, make sure to read up on
          how today's common version became popular. A 51-year-old woman named
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesta_Stoudt">Vesta Stoudt</a>,
          mother of 8, mailed her idea for a better ammunition box seal to the
          president (who approved production) after her bosses didn't do
          anything with the suggestion.
        </i></p>
        <p>Anyway, the goal is to be handy.</p>

        <p>
          Use <span>status</span> to see the state of dt.
          Here we see piped standard input is a list of strings.
        </p>
        <pre>        $ echo -e "one\ntwo\nthree!" | dt status
        [ [ "one" "two" "three!" ] ]
        </pre>

        <p>
          Print lines to stdout with <span>pls</span> or
          <span>printlns</span>.
        </p>
        <pre>        $ echo -e "one\ntwo\nthree!" | dt pls
        one
        two
        three!
        </pre>
        <p>
          (See also: <span>p</span>,
          <span>print</span>, <span>pl</span>,
          <span>println</span>)
        </p>

        <p>
          Explore definitions with <span>defs</span> and
          <span>usage</span>.
        </p>
        <pre>        $ dt defs pls | head -n 3
        *
        +
        -

        $ dt   \\pls usage pls   quit
        ( [&lt;a&gt;] -- ) Print the values of the most recent quote, each followed by a newline, to standard output.
        </pre>

        <p>
          In dt, everything is evaluated left-to-right. This means we don't
          write "3 + 4" because the "+" wouldn't have enough information to add
          yet. Instead we write <span>3 4 +</span>.
        </p>
        <pre>        $ dt 3 4 + pl   quit
        7
        </pre>

        <p>
          All commands are evaluated left-to-right, including <span>def</span>
          which is a command that defines more commands. In dt, a command
          is a binding to a value or a "quote" of values and commands. In other
          words, a command is what other languages call functions, variables,
          procedures, subroutines, bindings, etc. Some commands are built-in,
          others are defined in dt source code. Anyway let's
          <span>def</span> some stuff to use it. (I'm going to
          feed the code as a single string to avoid escapes, and assume a
          shell that can interpret multiline strings.)
        </p>
        <pre>        $ dt '3 \three def
              4 \four def
              [+ pl] \add-and-print def
              three four add-and-print
              quit'
        7
        </pre>
        <p>
          Above you can see we bound <span>3</span> to a new
          command <span>three</span> and did similar for
          <span>four</span>. These are like variables, but
          can also be thought of as a command that produces a single value.
        </p>
        <p>
          Above you can also see we bound <span>+</span> and
          <span>pl</span> in sequence to a new command
          <span>add-and-print</span>. Calling this performed
          its two commands.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes you just want to bind as values that would not execute the
          code immediately (For example: to bind a quote as a list). for this
          we can use <span>:</span> to bind values.
        </p>
        <pre>        $ dt  3 4 [+ pl]   [three four add-and-print]: \
              three four add-and-print \
              status \
              quit
        [ 3 4 [ + pl ] ]
        </pre>
        <p>
          This bound three values to three identifiers. It didn't execute the
          last quotation though, it simply provided it again. Let's finish up
          by executing with <span>do</span>.
        </p>
        <pre>        $ dt  3 4 [+ pl]   [three four add-and-print]: \
              three four add-and-print \
              do \
              quit

        <p>
          The <span>[</span> and <span>]</span>
          characters begin and end quotations. Quotations are sequences of zero
          or more values, each of any kind. Commands in a quotation are not
          immediately executed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <span>"</span> character begins and ends a string
          value.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>true</span> and <span>false</span>
          read as boolean values.

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Porting Xbox360 executables to Windows</h2>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/rexdex/recompiler/blob/master/_images/xbox_remcompiler.jpg"><img src="https://github.com/rexdex/recompiler/raw/master/_images/xbox_remcompiler.jpg" alt="DolphinDemoScreenshot"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The idea is simple: <em>what if you could take the Xbox360 game and run it on your PC?</em> Is this even possible in principle? I was pondering this question few years ago and that should not come as a surprise that there are some obvious technical difficulties in getting this done:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Different CPUs</strong> - Xbox360 uses PowerPC based CPU, our PCs are based on x86 architecture. They are different in so many ways that I don't even know where to start :) PowerPC is RISC based, has shitloads of registers but very simple instructions. x86 is totally different on the other hand - not so many registers and many more instructions that are more complicated (addressing modes...). It's obvious that a simple transcription is not feasible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Memory Layout</strong> - Xbox360 uses BigEndian byte ordering, x86 CPUs use LittleEndian. To be compatible with incoming data that is being read from files and read/written into the memory all memory based operands must be byteswapped. This may pose a significant performance issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Encrypted executable image</strong> - Yup, for various reasons the executables on Xbox360 are encrypted. There are some cleaver guys in Russia though that figured how :)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Different and outdated GPU architecture</strong> - If we want to see any graphics rendered the GPU needs to be emulated. There are two hard nuts to crack: first, the shaders we see will be complied into the GPU compatible format, no HLSL on input, sorry. Those shaders will have to be reverse engineered as well. Secondly, the Xbox360 GPU was using ~10MB of internal memory called EDRAM that was serving as a temporary storage of render target for the duration of rendering. Although some cards today still use similar concept this is never exposed directly to the user. Since there a lot of different ways people used the EDRAM on Xbox this part has to be emulated. To be honest probably differently for every game.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Inlining of graphics/kernel functions</strong> - Some of the functions used while compiling the executable were inlined directly into the compiled code making it much harder to write a simple API level wrapper. This kills the dream of making "function level" wrapper where we could just go and wrap the "d3d-&gt;DrawPrimitive" call directly. Nope, this is not going to happen.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Fortunately, every problem is solvable and the answer is <em><strong>YES</strong></em> in principle. If you want to know how, keep reading :)</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Current state of the project</h2>
<p dir="auto">Currently the published branch of the project allows to run simple Xbox360 demo apps (samples). I've not yet attempted to run it with any real game as it probably would not work with anything big and serious. Also, on the legal side, this is a fine line because getting anything bigger is tricky as it requires going basically to the Torrent Sites and digging through old Xbox Live Arcade content or pirated game. Xbox360 is not yet abandonware :) For the same reason there are no source executables given, you need to get one "from somewhere". Sorry :(</p>

<li><em>Time Machine</em> tool that makes it possible to find previous instruction that touched given register or memory</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How to run it ?</h2>
<p dir="auto">(NOTE: You require Visual Studio 2015 to build and use this project - at present it is entirely Windows-specific with regards to the code and the build process.)</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Get <code>wxWidgets 3.1.0</code> and compile it to obtain the x64 DLLs. Place them in <code>dev\external\wxWidgets-3.1.0\</code>.</li>
<li>Open the solution <code>recompile.sln</code> under <code>dev\src</code> with Visual Studio. This is the top-level VS solution that we will use to build the project.</li>
<li>Compile the whole solution. You should now have binaries and their associated symbols under <code>_bin\Debug</code> in your project root directory.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Now you have two ways to use a binary XEX file and obtain x86-64 code from it. The first way is to use the GUI, which can be launched using <code>recompiler_tools</code>. This way is straightforward - create a new project (or open an existing <code>.rep</code> project), add an image to it (this is your XEX file), and then use the toolbar to build the imported image. You will see a log window pop up and at the end of the process, you should be able to click on the <em>Run</em> button to run your newly recompiled binary.</p>
<p dir="auto">The second way is to use the command-line APIs as follows:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Run <code>recompiler_api -command=decompile -in=imagePath -out=outputPath</code> to decompile your image. <code>imagePath</code> should point to your XEX file, and <code>outputPath</code> should point to the folder where you want the output (uncompressed XEX, with the filename <code>output.pdi</code>) to go to.</li>
<li>Run <code>recompiler_api -command=recompile -in=pdiPath -out=outputPath -generator=cpp_msvc</code> to recompile the PDI output from the previous step into native code. At the end of the process you should have the recompiled binary, <code>code.bin</code> in <code>outputPath</code>.</li>
<li>Run <code>xenon_launcher -fsroot=dataPath -image=binPath</code> to launch the recompiled binary. <code>dataPath</code> refers to the folder where the assets of the binary can be found (example: <code>projects\xenon\dolphin</code> for the file <code>dolphin.xex</code>), and <code>binPath</code> is the location of the <code>.bin</code> file from the previous step.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">To exit the app (or end the <code>xenon_launcher</code> process), simply close the GPU output window.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">XEX</h2>
<p dir="auto">First, the XEX (Xbox Executable) format must be ripped apart and the actual code has to be extracted. XEX is a Xbox360 specific executable packing/encryption format. It's not very complicated and quite good description can be found here: <a href="http://free60.org/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">Free60</a>. There are also some old references <a href="http://www.openrce.org/forums/posts/111" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Inside the XEX there are some platform specific headers (like file certificate, media/region information, file encryption key, etc) but also there's a normal
PE style executable, unfortunately it's packed and encrypted.</p>
<p dir="auto">Decryption of any actual executables requires knowing the secret AES key that is used internally by the loader to compute another AES key that is actually used to decrypt the file content. I found it on a Russian site few years ago but could not retrace my steps any more, most likely the site is down gone for good. The rest of the XEX format suggests strongly that it was basically built on top of existing PE image loader that existed in the OS. The compression used in the XEX is either simple block based compression or a variation of LZ compression. Both were identified and reversed years ago by people trying to break the Xbox360 anti-piracy protection.</p>
<p dir="auto">Anyway, after dealing with those two bumps on the road and unpacking the "internal EXE" from the XEX we follow normal disassembly procedure. In general case we end up with a list of sections:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=".rdata   0x00000400-0x0004C100 r__
.pdata   0x0004C200-0x00053358 r__
.text    0x00060000-0x0026B158 r_x
.data    0x00270000-0x00289D50 rw_
.XBMOVIE 0x00289E00-0x00289E08 rw_
.idata   0x00290000-0x00290268 rw_
.XBLD    0x002A0000-0x002A0090 r__
.reloc   0x002A0200-0x002B2EF4 r__"><pre><code>.rdata   0x00000400-0x0004C100 r__
.pdata   0x0004C200-0x00053358 r__
.text    0x00060000-0x0026B158 r_x
.data    0x00270000-0x00289D50 rw_
.XBMOVIE 0x00289E00-0x00289E08 rw_
.idata   0x00290000-0x00290268 rw_
.XBLD    0x002A0000-0x002A0090 r__
.reloc   0x002A0200-0x002B2EF4 r__
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The only section that contains executable code is the .text section and only that section requires disassembly. Rest of the sections must still be loaded into the memory when we try to execute the code since data may be read/written into those addresses. For now I did not implement any data relocation so the unpacked image must be loaded exactly under its base address. Fortunately on 64-bit systems this is achievable fairly easily.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Disassembly</h2>
<p dir="auto">Disassembling the PowerPC instructions is a pleasure. After we identify the .text (code) section in the PE executable the rest is straightforward. Every instruction is always 4 bytes so there is no ambiguity like with x86 instructions and even if we don't know how to decode a particular instruction we can easily continue with the rest of the code. This allows us to have semi-working solution way sooner than with x86. See the <a href="https://github.com/rexdex/recompiler/blob/master/dev/src/platforms/xenon/xenonDecompiler/xenonInstructionDecoding.cpp">actual file</a> for details.</p>
<p dir="auto">Basically in this project I've tried 3 ways to approach the subject:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Script based (for faster iteration) - I've written a LUA script that was doing the disassembly. It was fast to iterate in small samples but very slow to run and disassemble millions of instructions in normal executables was taking minutes. Even to check if an instruction is valid instruction was taking way too much time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Data driven pattern matching - Basically a big XML with binary "rules" that were matching bit patterns and emitting instructions. This was much faster but because of the corner cases in the PowerPC instruction encoding it got messy in the end and required me to do a lot of copy-pasting. Performance wise it was fast and could work if not for a one little detail: it's not enough just to disassemble the code, we still need to extract some "metadata" out of the code (like register dependencies, calculated jump addresses, etc). This still requires us to know a little bit about the instruction that just its name. So, the template-based disassembler was producing an instruction named "bc" but I still had to write manual code to understand that it's a "conditional branch" and even more code to be able to evaluate this condition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Finally I ended up with an abstract CPUInstruction class that is implemented for every instruction that CPU implements + a big ass C++ switch() to do the disassembly. This is actually very nice and maintainable solution.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The <em><strong>biggest</strong></em> and most valuable resources on this topic were the official PowerPC instruction set documentation: <a href="http://fileadmin.cs.lth.se/cs/education/EDAN25/PowerISA_V2.07_PUBLIC.pdf" rel="nofollow">Power ISA Version 2.07</a></p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Testing the disassembler</h2>
<p dir="auto">I had lots of bugs in the disassembler. Of course, I could write a unit test for each instruction but that would just take ages. The fastest way I've found to test the correctness of the disassembly is to compare the output with something that we know works. Basically, disassembling any big PowerPC executable by IDA or any other disassemble and comparing the output of tens of millions of instructions is a very good step towards some level of trust that the disassembler is working :)</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">XBox360 specific instructions</h2>
<p dir="auto">Xbox360 has a special version of the PowerPC CPU that has 128 VMX registers (instead of 32 ones in the standard CPU). Those registers are used for vectorized math operations (similarly to SSE). There's no way to address 128 registers in normal PowerPC instructions because there are only 5 bits delegated to indicate the register index in every instruction and this pattern is CPU-wide. Unfortunately, the opcodes for those special instructions are not available on the internet (or are buried deeply). I ended up reversing the opcodes manually by observing the bit patters in the generated listing files. There's a simple tool I've wrote for that <a href="https://github.com/rexdex/recompiler/blob/master/dev/tools/xprint/XOpPrint.cpp">XPrint</a>. Typical output of a decoded instruction bit pattern looks like this:</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Abstract instruction</h2>
<p dir="auto">The result of disassembly process is an "unpacked instruction". The most useful thing is that the opcode and operands are unpacked so an easy "ToString" method can be written for presentation purposes. Surprisingly, this structure captures a lot of quirks of not only the PowerPC instructions but Intel as well. On PowerPC the operand type is closely related to the particular instruction type (add vs addi, etc). On Intel this is not the case and the same instruction (add) may be used with immediate value as well as memory location, etc. To capture this generalization the Operand structure is introduced.</p>

<p dir="auto">In practice, the unpacked format is not good enough for many operations. After the disassembly is completed more work is needed to get the code to a useful state than just unpacking. For example, we need to identify the "blocks" - places in the code where execution enters a particular linear set of instruction that are going to be executed without interruptions until a "jump" or "call" to another block. It's nice and useful to abstract this instruction concept a little bit more. This is done by the following class:</p>

<p dir="auto">By filling in this class the decompiler can express much more about the instruction - i.e. what is it going to do with the control flow of the program or what registers are being read/written by it. Each actual PowerPC instruction has its opcode class that is able to transform the Instruction into the InstructionExtendedInfo.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Blocks</h2>
<p dir="auto">After all instructions are disassembled it's important to identify blocks of instructions that can have known single place of entry. This is done by analyzing all the "call" and "jump" instructions that can be resolved. This is not foolproof as it does not identify properly the indirect calls (vtable, function pointers) and indirect jumps (switch statements). The more knowledge about a block we have and the more certainty about the points of entry the faster code we will be able to generate.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Recompilation</h2>
<p dir="auto">After all the code is disassembled we can start to decompile it into logically equivalent representation. The simple trick here is to realize that for the sake of just getting it to work we don't need to convert the code into any high-level language. What matters is to get the same execution results. The CPU state is represented as a structure:</p>

<p dir="auto">It takes the current IP (instruction pointer) directly as the argument + the current CPU state expressed by the "regs". The returned value represents next address to execute. This is the lowest (slowest) code generation level that we have. In this mode we are putting <em><strong>ALL BURDEN</strong></em> of optimizing this to final assembly to the target compiler.

<p dir="auto">There are more optimization steps possible that I'm currently working on - for example if all blocks in a function are "well behaved" - no indirect jumps are found and the function follows ABI rules - clear preamble can be identified + all return statements have proper cleanup code, then we can promote the whole function to a single C++ function pulling all blocks inside + defining all VOLATILE registers inside the function (on stack) and not using the ones in the <em>regs</em> structure.</p>
<p dir="auto">Next optimization step can occur when two "well behaved" functions are calling each other. Then, instead of going through the generic call via the returned "next instruction address" we can generate code like this:</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>Have you ever noticed that you can’t really “buy” an ebook? Sure, when you click that “Buy Now” button on your ereader, tablet, or phone, it feels like a complete, seamless transaction. But the minute you try to treat your ebook like a physical book – say by sharing it with a friend, selling it to someone else, donating it to a school library, or sometimes even reading it offline, reality sets in. You can’t do any of those things.</p><p>With most ebooks, even if you think you “own” them, the publisher or platform you bought them from will say otherwise. Publishers and platforms insist that you only buy a license to access the books, not the rights to do anything else with them. And because platforms like Amazon and Apple control most of the technology we use to read ebooks, their opinion often dictates the reality of the ebook ecosystem. Beyond controlling books, these platforms can also do several things no physical bookseller has ever had the power to do. They can track your reading habits, stop you from reselling or lending a book, change the book’s content, and delete it from your digital library altogether – even after you’ve bought it. This doesn’t happen in the print book market, where you can still feel confident that when you buy a book, it’s yours to share, sell, or simply read without it being tracked or censored.</p><p>Something happened when we shifted to digital formats that created a loss of rights for readers. Pulling back the curtain on the evolution of ebooks offers some clarity to how the shift to digital left ownership behind in the analog world.</p><p>While most publishers still sell physical books, when it comes to ebooks, the vast majority appear to have made a collective decision to shift to offering only limited licenses. Some of the reasons for this shift are economic, some legal, some technological, and others psychological – a belief that limiting or eliminating digital ownership of books will raise publisher revenues, forstall free copies leaking onto unauthorized websites, and allow publishers and platforms unprecedented control and tracking of the behaviors of readers, as well as universities and libraries that provide ebooks. Whether these beliefs map to reality, however, is hotly contested.</p><blockquote><p>Just as platforms control our tweets, our updates, and the images that we upload, platforms can also control the books we buy, keeping tabs on how, when, and where we use them, and at times, modifying or even deleting their content at will.</p></blockquote><p>Economically, platforms and publishers also believe licensing gives them more control over how ebooks generate revenues. For example, they currently use licensing to charge libraries for the right to lend the book to patrons, or tying ebooks to platforms that monitor user behavior, creating a new revenue stream based on selling user data.</p><p>Legally, the shift from selling to licensing attempts to circumvent centuries of law that have limited publisher control over post-sale uses of books. This law is a copyright doctrine called “exhaustion” or “first sale.” The idea behind first sale is that publishers were always entitled to make money from the first time they sold a book, but after that, the sold copy is beyond their control. The new owner can decide to resell, lend, or use the book in any manner they see fit. Licensing attempts to keep that control with the copyright owner, forever.</p><p>Technologically, publishers have turned to companies like Amazon, Apple, and OverDrive to distribute and control their ebooks. These publisher-platform partnerships presented new opportunities for publishers to remain involved in the post-sale life of a book. Just as platforms control our tweets, our updates, and the images that we upload, platforms can also control the books we buy, keeping tabs on how, when, and where we use them, and at times, modifying or even deleting their content at will. That same control also allows platforms to monitor when and how you read, which is key to new revenue streams based on selling user data.</p><p>Finally, psychologically, publisher-platform partnerships have reinforced a belief long held by publishers that with greater legal and technological control, they will reap greater financial rewards. Publishers believe these rewards flow from forcing purchasers to pay for additional uses (such as when libraries want to lend out ebooks to patrons), and by limiting how books are shared and distributed outside of their control. While it is unclear that any of these beliefs have manifested into reality, the psychology has taken hold, in part because ebook platforms have now locked publishers into this partnership in ways that make it extremely difficult to disentangle.</p><p>This report explains that, while there is nothing new about publishers’ desire to seek novel ways to increase revenues, along with control and surveillance of readers, the new publisher-platform partnership creates a mechanism to align the ebook market with those goals. That new market alignment raises questions about whether these shifts are the best option for readers and institutional book buyers, particularly libraries. It also raises questions about how the newest players in the market – ebook distribution platforms – shape things to align with their own interests.</p><p>In order to fully understand the dynamics at play, we interviewed over 30 stakeholders that fill various essential roles in the ebook marketplace, from publishers to platform CEOs to literary agents, librarians, and lawyers.<sup tabindex="3" id="2DB9ANiNeJKOGIxzrjmXlB"></sup> We discussed the priorities, concerns, and constraints that help shape their participation in the ebook marketplace. Our goal was to understand and document how this world looks through their eyes, and synthesize those views into broader conclusions. In the following sections, we will deconstruct the shifts that have made it difficult to actually own an ebook collection, as well as the challenge that lies ahead if we wish to resurrect ownership as a consumer choice for ebooks.<sup tabindex="3" id="4lGdPO2VYhEgPKbYhdYsxk"></sup></p><p>Our study leads us to several key conclusions:</p><ul><li><p>By turning to platforms as the primary technical means for conveying ebooks, publishers have introduced a third major player into the ebook supply chain: ebook platform companies. Together with publishers, platforms have restricted the ebook market to one composed primarily of licensing instead of sales.</p></li><li><p>The platform companies have motives and goals that are independent of those of publishers or purchasers (including institutional buyers such as libraries and schools). Rather than looking to profit from individual sales, like a bookstore does, platforms compete to collect and control the most aggregate content and consumer data. This enables what are now widely known as “surveillance capitalism” revenue models, from data brokering to personalized ad targeting to the use of content lock-in subscription models.<sup tabindex="3" id="20lJVDR0YulTjg2xABmKUF"></sup> These platforms’ goals are sometimes at odds with the interests of libraries and readers.</p></li><li><p>The introduction of platforms, and especially publisher-platform partnerships, has created new forms of legal and technological lock-in on the publisher side, with dependencies on platform infrastructure posing serious barriers to publishers independently selling ebooks directly to consumers. Platforms have few incentives to support direct sales models that do not require licensing, as those models do not easily support tracking user behavior.</p></li><li><p>The structure of the ebook marketplace has introduced new stressors into both the publishing and library professions. Publishers and libraries feel they are facing existential crises/collapse, and their fears are pushing them into diametrically opposed viewpoints. Publishers feel pressured to protect and paywall their content, while libraries feel pressure to maintain relevant collections that are easily accessible via digital networks. Both libraries and publishers feel dependent on the ebook platform companies to provide the ebooks that readers demand, allowing the platform economy (which is already dominated by only a few large companies) to have even more power over the ebook marketplace.</p></li><li><p>Because of the predominance of the publisher-platform licensing model for the ebook marketplace, important questions exist as to the impact, if any, that digital library lending of books has on that market. For example, while some evidence exists that the availability of second-hand physical books via libraries and used bookstores might compete with direct publisher book sales, it is less clear that the digital loan of a single title by a library competes with platform ebook subscriptions and locked-in book purchases. Moreover, given that publisher-platform partnerships profit from surveillance of book buyers, consumers who choose more privacy-friendly library loans may represent an entirely distinct market that places significant value on data protection.</p></li><li><p>While access to user data generated by platform surveillance of readers is a potential benefit to publishers, in practice publishers do not fully exploit (and may not have full access to) that information.</p></li></ul><h2 id="the-emergence-of-the-publisher-platform-partnership">The Emergence of the Publisher-Platform Partnership</h2><p>Before getting into the details of how the ebook marketplace has evolved, it is worth considering the major market players and how they relate to one another.<sup tabindex="3" id="zvGYWDwrpXbA9ufmX4wkV"></sup> This is key to understanding why the publisher-platform partnership has been so effective in structuring the ebook market in a way that is different from the physical book market.</p><h3 id="the-physical-book-market">The Physical Book Market</h3><p>One simplified way to imagine the physical book market is as having two poles. One pole is publishers. The other is purchasers.</p><div><p>Figure 1. The physical book market.</p><p><img id="6GOlP27STGmELVu5PZIvgE" src="https://images.ctfassets.net/7yhm3nqs96oa/78HEbBa9RuszDMhDlwfx0V/e302e837e151c32f6fa3e58ad9190940/fig-1.png" alt="A graphic illustrating a spectrum with two poles, 'Publishers' and 'Purchasers'."></p><p>One simplified way to imagine the physical book market is as having two poles. One pole is publishers. The other is purchasers.</p></div><p>The publishers work with authors to bring individual titles to market. It is the role of the publishers to manage the economic life of the book. Most authors hand over control of the economic life of the book – marketing, design, manufacturing, distribution – to the publishers.</p><p>The purchasers take a book out of the publisher’s control and into the world. The purchaser may be an institutional purchaser, like a library, or an individual reader who wants to own the book themselves. The purchaser may also provide others access to the books, such as public school students or library patrons. Whatever form they take, once the purchaser has purchased the book, the book leaves the control of the publisher and becomes the property of the purchaser.</p><p>Of course, bookstores (and equivalent intermediaries in the institutional context) are also an important part of this equation. They serve as a bridge between publishers and purchasers. Bookstores order books from publishers, market them to purchasers, and ultimately deliver them into the hands of purchasers.</p><div><p>Figure 2. Bookstores serve as a bridge between publishers and purchasers.</p><p><img id="6mqa9Yfn8Fd8AUoHB9h8kf" src="https://images.ctfassets.net/7yhm3nqs96oa/1YP8XH4xS7QQ681L5oxbPw/fff65e6e67107d9079fbcb2bc3604d17/fig-2.png" alt="A graphic illustrating the spectrum from Figure 1 with two poles, 'Publishers' and 'Purchasers', but adding 'Bookstores' as a bridge between the two poles."></p><p>Bookstores order books from publishers, market them to purchasers, and ultimately deliver them into the hands of purchasers.</p></div><p>However, bookstores have only a transitory moment of control over the books. When they order books, they either sell them to purchasers or return them to publishers. The bookstores have no direct control over how publishers decide to create individual titles, nor do they have the ability to control how purchasers use the books, once they are purchased. In fact, all of the flows in the physical book market are essentially one way – from publishers, to bookstores, to purchasers.</p><h3 id="the-ebook-market-and-the-publisher-platform-partnership">The Ebook Market and the Publisher-Platform Partnership</h3><p>The ebook market is different in some key ways. One important difference is that the flows in the ebook market do not move in just one direction. Swapping ebook platforms for bookstores creates a long-term connection among everyone involved in the transaction. Unlike distributors and bookstores, ebook platforms have an ongoing relationship with ebooks that extends well beyond the point of purchase. Not only do ebook platforms market and sell the books – they are where purchasers go to manage and read them. This ongoing relationship with the ebook is fundamentally different from the temporary transactional nature bookstores play in the physical book market. Instead of the bipolar publisher-purchaser physical book market, the ebooks market involves publishers, purchasers, and platforms. These nodes are in constant dialogue with each other, well past the point of purchase.</p><div><p>Figure 3. The ebook market and the publisher-platform partnership.</p><p><img id="1Kib3anQK6CBe6XwNWjWXe" src="https://images.ctfassets.net/7yhm3nqs96oa/5prCphomm9A4G4V4PStVng/503a22ff04a119a4a3ebe47bca4c5b9f/fig-3.png" alt="A graphic illustrating three nodes in constant connection with each other: 'Publishers', 'Purchasers', and 'Platforms. "></p><p>Instead of the bipolar publisher-purchaser physical book market, the ebooks market involves publishers, purchasers, and platforms. These nodes are in constant dialogue with each other, well past the point of purchase.</p></div><p>By maintaining contact with the ebook and the purchaser in perpetuity, platforms have the opportunity to generate new types of data about purchasers and their habits. Publishers and platforms team up to exercise levels of control over purchasers and copies of ebooks in ways that are impossible in the physical book market.</p><p>Like all partnerships, the publisher-platform partnership encompasses distinct incentives that are often – but not always – aligned.<sup tabindex="3" id="6spWjgzXzXYDOxuHlGkoyz"></sup> When publishers and platforms coordinate, they can shape the market in their favor by limiting traditional rights of purchasers.</p><p>Publishers and platforms share incentives to increase control over how ebooks are used, especially at the expense of the purchasers. Both can also benefit from accessing reader data, although, as discussed in more detail below, the nature of the benefits differs somewhat. Publishers and platforms also have an interest in preventing purchaser behavior that they disapprove of. Sometimes, that behavior is illegal behavior, such as large-scale pirating of ebooks. Other times, that behavior is simply behavior that the publishers and platforms see as contrary to their own interests, such as lending an ebook to a friend.</p><p>There are also times when the publishers’ and platforms’ interests do not align. Platforms have clear incentives to lock purchasers into their platform, and monetizing user data is core to their business models. Publishers have incentives to sell more books, which could potentially benefit from a diversity of platforms competing with each other for different types of purchasers. Publishers may also be less effective than platforms at fully exploiting user data, and less interested in doing so.</p><p>While these differences are important, the aligned interests of the publisher-platform partnership have been powerful enough to create an ebook market that is very different from the physical book market. This paper focuses on a number of dynamics that flow from the partnership, and changes that those dynamics create.</p><h2 id="from-physical-book-sales-to-ebook-licensing-an-opportunity-for-publishers-to-achieve-long-held-goals">From Physical Book Sales to Ebook Licensing – An Opportunity for Publishers to Achieve Long-Held Goals</h2><p>The markets for ebooks and physical books are very different. Some of those differences are obvious – physical books are easy to measure and identify as individual objects, while ebooks are more fluid and ephemeral as data that can be stored, transmitted, and accessed in myriad ways. Other differences emerge only when readers attempt to treat ebooks like physical books, and in doing so run into legal and technological restrictions.</p><p>As we will explain below, physical books are governed by rules of property and ownership that can be traced back centuries. These rules give people who own physical books clear rights over how they can use those books. However, the rules that govern ebooks are much less clear.</p><h3 id="from-owning-to-purchasing-with-licenses-and-tracking">From Owning to ‘Purchasing’ (With Licenses and Tracking)</h3><p>For centuries, the law has always balanced the right of an author or publisher to control their intellectual property with the right of a book purchaser to control the copy they buy. Every sale of a physical book involves an exchange. Purchasers pay money to the publisher. In return, publishers give up their ownership over that copy of the book being sold. The purchaser owns their copy of the book and can treat it as their private property, not worrying what the publisher might want.</p><p>Over the years, publishers have made many attempts to avoid this exchange, controlling both the purchase price and what purchasers do with the books after they are sold. For example, in the early 1900s, publishers tried to control resale prices on the books people bought from retailers by stamping mandatory resale prices on a book’s front page.<sup tabindex="3" id="1c2hgE9w9tQXD6pTuwcVQ3"></sup> (That attempt was rejected by the US Supreme Court).<sup tabindex="3" id="Qdtm4hR65hIuXea02Y8Fs"></sup> Publishers also tried to limit where people could resell books they bought, in one case claiming that a book sold in Thailand couldn’t be resold in the US.<sup tabindex="3" id="7xbMzSd6WDeztyUyYg47oX"></sup> (That attempt was also rejected by the US Supreme Court, in 2013).<sup tabindex="3" id="fR4UAMQcRvuyXuZQdwX6o"></sup> These attempts failed because the publisher’s copyright does not give them absolute control of a book in perpetuity; the copyright system is a balance between publishers and purchasers.<sup tabindex="3" id="2PZ7hxi50VmyCXGtHco4vG"></sup> If publishers want the benefits of the copyright system, they also have to accept the limits it imposes on their power.</p><p>Publishers do not get to tell purchasers what they can do with physical books, because of a longstanding principle in copyright law called “exhaustion,” also known as “the First Sale Doctrine.”<sup tabindex="3" id="2MDHbtEFeQOMWnrBpsQ7mr"></sup> This rule says that as soon as a copyright holder parts with a copy of their work – whether through a sale, a donation, or even by throwing copies in a trash bin – they no longer have any claim of control over that copy. Instead, whomever comes into lawful possession of that copy now has all of the “incidents of ownership” that come with any other form of personal property. This rule is not limited to physical objects that are protected by copyright. It protects anyone who purchases any sort of physical object. In the same way that a car company cannot shut down independent used car lots and toaster companies cannot police the prices of used toasters at thrift stores, publishers cannot claim control over the copies of books we lawfully own.</p><blockquote><p>Copyright law provides incentives for publishers to help produce books, periodicals, and magazines. It also supports institutions such as libraries and archives that work to preserve those works after they are sold and ensure long-lasting access.</p></blockquote><p>This rule exists for many reasons – respect for personal property, market efficiency, privacy, and preservation chief among them. Copyright law provides incentives for publishers to help produce books, periodicals, and magazines. It also supports institutions such as libraries and archives that work to preserve those works after they are sold and ensure long-lasting access. For physical books, all of this happens seamlessly every day because of the First Sale Doctrine.</p><p>The advent of digital books has reinvigorated this long-running battle over post-exchange uses, with publishers claiming that they have the right to charge money for an ebook and decide what happens to that digital copy after money has changed hands.<sup tabindex="3" id="7krG0C9Eat6ArdKa0LOIDN"></sup></p><h3 id="publishers-belief-that-secondary-markets-and-library-lending-undermine-profits">Publishers’ Belief That Secondary Markets and Library Lending Undermine Profits</h3><p>For decades, publishers have expressed displeasure over the ways the First Sale Doctrine has prevented them from exercising control over books once they were sold to customers. These critiques often target the secondary market, where used books are sold at prices, times, and places beyond publishers’ control by sellers with no obligations to report those sales back to the original publishers. After several failed attempts to challenge the First Sale Doctrine in the context of the physical book market, many of the publishers’ concerns seem now to be manifesting within the rules of ebook distribution platforms and licenses.<sup tabindex="3" id="2YYlZG4b9Usdro4BJRUmJ7"></sup></p><p>Economic studies paint a complex picture of the interplay among used book markets, new book sales, publisher profits, and overall consumer welfare for physical books.<sup tabindex="3" id="5LjgEpfSdz4IMncO2z6BUG"></sup> In some cases, the used book market may increase publisher profits because people are willing to pay a higher price for a new book they know they can sell later. In other cases, a lower-priced used copy of a book could steer a purchaser away from paying full price for a new copy. However, even in the case of consumer preferences for cheaper used copies, or borrowing books from libraries instead of purchasing them, it is unclear how often used book purchases or library loans are actual substitutes for new-book buying. Participants who work with libraries at Big Five publishing houses did recognize that libraries are sites of discovery that lead to book sales. There are also other social benefits of secondary markets, such as privacy and preservation, that can impact the analysis.</p><blockquote><p>Regardless of the actual impact that a robust secondary market may have on an individual publisher’s sales and profits, for well over a century publishers have demonstrated that they believe the secondary market acts to undercut prices, sales, and profits in the primary book market.</p></blockquote><p>Regardless of the actual impact that a robust secondary market may have on an individual publisher’s sales and profits, for well over a century publishers have demonstrated that they believe the secondary market acts to undercut prices, sales, and profits in the primary book market. This belief that the secondary market is harming their business has driven publishers’ behavior since at least the start of the 20th century. That publisher wariness of the uncontrolled use of books is key to understanding publisher motivations as the ebook market has evolved.</p><p>Bobbs-Merrill Company v. Straus, the 1908 Supreme Court case that established the First Sale Doctrine in United States common law, flowed directly from a publisher’s attempt to control the minimum price that the novel The Castaway could be sold for on the secondary market.<sup tabindex="3" id="7t3qetQJIPQI3jdRI3XFMI"></sup> In that case, The Castaway’s publisher, the Bobbs-Merrill Company, added a notice to each copy of the book that no dealer was “authorized” to sell the book for less than $1. When the Straus brothers purchased a number of copies and decided to sell them for less than $1, Bobbs-Merrill sued to enforce its $1 price floor. Ultimately, the US Supreme Court ruled that Straus did not need “authorization” from Bobbs-Merrill (or anyone else) to sell the books at whatever price they chose. Once Bobbs-Merrill sold the books, their preferences for how the books were used did not matter.</p><p>This hostility toward the secondary market continued even after the Bobb-Merrill decision tamped down publishers’ legal power to limit it. In 1931, a group of book publishers hired PR pioneer Edward Bernays – the “father of spin” – to fight against used “dollar books” and the general practice of book lending. Bernays decided to run a contest to “look for a pejorative word for the book borrower, the wretch who raised hell with book sales and deprived authors of earned royalties.” The contest generated an impressive list of verbal assaults on those who would dare to lend or receive a book without paying for the privilege to do so. Suggested names included “book weevil,” “bookbum,” “culture vulture,” “book-bummer,” and “book buzzard.”<sup tabindex="3" id="6QseBo4rIORVNcno54jSYs"></sup></p><div><p>Figure 4.

E. Ferguson’s 1969 revised-edition economics textbook, he genially declared that “[s]ince everyone knows the basic reason for a revised edition is to kill off the existing used book market, it would be idle to suggest otherwise.”<sup tabindex="3" id="3AJG6tMH2dtfVeMZqyK40q"></sup> Similarly, in 1974, it was reported that “[p]ublisher’s representatives have no doubt” second-hand copies of textbooks acted as “a drain on publishers’ and authors’ profits.”<sup tabindex="3" id="3FYsONgiNNSIMVeXjG3W9p"></sup></p><p>Publishers demonstrated their antipathy toward the secondary market again when Amazon launched its secondary book market. In 2002, Association of American Publishers (AAP) President Patricia Schroeder told The New York Times: “I wring my hands, pound my desk and say, ‘Aargh,’” because publishers could not legally prevent Amazon from immediately offering used books for sale (at a price outside of the publishers’ control), once those books entered the market.<sup tabindex="3" id="61RrrcdhyxSwewnjGZ5kQG"></sup> Schroeder pleads for more control over the secondary market: “‘We asked could we at least talk about when something could become available as a used book? Could we maybe wait three months after the book was published?”</p><p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos responded to the complaints by reminding publishers about the First Sale Doctrine: “When someone buys a book, they are also buying the right to resell that book, to loan it out, or to even give it away if they want. Everyone understands this.”<sup tabindex="3" id="3IhMkqhmu0I5NVoUAWH4b0"></sup> In short, Bezos said tough luck – ownership confers certain rights, including the right to resell.<sup tabindex="3" id="1LC092NTJpWSj8VDsJhKPZ"></sup></p><p>Having no luck in judicial courts or the courts of public opinion when it came to controlling the secondary market for physical books, publishers saw a new opportunity as they began to offer ebooks to the public. They saw ebook licenses – not sales – as a way to retain control over digital books by preventing secondary markets from developing. Platforms like Amazon, and other secondhand booksellers, cannot resell ebooks they or their users do not own. Borrowing from the software industry’s playbook, publishers adopted the practice of licensing content from ebooks instead of selling ebooks outright. By licensing ebooks, publishers could claim they avoid transferring digital ownership, which would create first sale rights for purchasers. A research study participant formerly at a Big Five publishing house explained the practical effect of this approach: “With a license, you can’t give it away. You can’t sell it. You can use it. And you can see why you have to do that. Right? Because if we sold you the digital file, you could resell it to whoever you want at whatever price you wanted. And there’s no limit.”</p><p>Although concerns about the secondary market usually are discussed in the context of used book sales, participants in the publishing industry also expressed wariness about book owners lending their books to friends. As a former executive at a major publishing house noted, one benefit of a license was that once you pay for an ebook, “you can’t give it away.”</p><p>Decades of publisher hostility does not prove that the secondary market actively harms the interests of publishers or authors. While there are publishing employees who do not seem to believe the resale of books is an ongoing concern to publishers, because they are resold through bookstores and similar venues, there is still evidence of a pervasive belief within the publishing industry that the ability of book purchasers to resell their books outside of publisher control is a problem that needs to be addressed. This belief may help explain the publishing industry’s enthusiasm for digital distribution models that eliminate first sale and the independent secondary market entirely.</p><h3 id="fear-loathing-and-imitation-of-the-music-industry-s-digital-marketplace">Fear, Loathing, and Imitation of the Music Industry’s Digital Marketplace</h3><p>The vendors and publishing workers interviewed for this study consistently cited the history of the music industry’s trials, tribulations, and ultimate transition to digital as a cautionary tale that helps explain why publishers adamantly prefer to structure all ebook purchases as licenses instead of sales. Publishers and booksellers saw music industry empires crumble in the early 2000s as open digital music formats such as MP3 became popular. Companies like Sam Goody and Tower Records shuttered their physical storefronts as people started downloading music from unauthorized sources like Napster, Kazaa, Aimster, Grokster, and LimeWire instead of buying physical copies.</p><p>For most study participants, the music industry acted as a powerful negative example of what could happen during a digital transition. It was cited by the publishers as a foundation of the current ebook market in proceedings against the Internet Archive’s Controlled Digital Lending service. “Mindful of the havoc wrought on the music industry by piracy and the uncontrolled appropriation of digital content, the Publishers developed a sustainable market for affordable ebooks with critical controls, including limiting commercial ebooks to one user account.”<sup tabindex="3" id="682dNKITriu1elj3V9GhrM"></sup></p><p>Later, a senior vice president of a Hachette imprint reiterated these concerns in the same proceeding. “Many authors (and some publishers) were initially wary of entering the ebook market, in large part because it emerged in the wake of the destruction that websites like Napster caused to the music industry.”<sup tabindex="3" id="2Z8NYKWsEzkMj8lKj5FQhq"></sup></p><p>Chantal Restivo-Alessi, the chief digital officer of HarperCollins, serves as a personal bridge between the two industries. “The ebook was developed in the shadow of rampant piracy in the music industry in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Concerns about the widespread unauthorized distribution of digital copies were front of mind when the company first began to evaluate the ebook format decades ago and have remained in the forefront of my thoughts once I joined the company in 2012. I know this history first-hand because I worked in the record industry from 1996 to 2007.”<sup tabindex="3" id="2KGjB0dGQaslq1nYC7uxWM"></sup></p><p>While it is not entirely clear how this history has influenced individual decision-making, its pervasiveness in discussions around ebooks is noteworthy in and of itself. “Books are a thin-margin business,” a former executive at a Big Five publisher said. “So if you have a drop of say, 15% of people who go into bookstores, they will not be able to make it through. And so you would have what happened to music stores happen to bookstores, and nobody in publishing wants to see that.”</p><p>One study participant, who is an executive with a book trade association, believes publishers misinterpreted how the music industry was ravaged by these changes.</p><blockquote><p>“There’s some aspects of what happened with music that applies to journal publishing and there are some types of books that might emulate what’s happening to journal publishing, but I think overall, what happened with music was that people didn’t want the bundle. They didn’t want the album. Most people, they wanted a song, or they wanted a couple of songs. And there was no market to create those songs until Napster came along. And Napster did it in a way that violated copyright and got it shut down but it opened the barn door to oh, we can sell songs and Apple stepped in, particularly among other [technology companies], and said, ‘Alright, we can help you, the label, sell more songs.’”</p></blockquote><p>In the early 2000s, Amazon experimented with the idea of selling a few pages of a book digitally. As Jim Zarroli reported for NPR in 2005, there didn’t appear to be much of a market for this service and it didn’t take long for Amazon to discontinue this service.<sup tabindex="3" id="7yZmSVKq9OlZ1hqWyRFBcz"></sup></p><p>“People don’t buy chapters,” the same participant added. “They do in education, but not in trade. It’s not to say that there isn’t some Napsterization of aspects of book publishing; I think for retail it’s not really relevant.”</p><p>Nonetheless, what happened with music and other entertainment formats was enough to have publishers concerned. As one executive with an ebook platform company recalled, in the early 2010s, publishers were extremely worried about the entire industry’s ability to be turned upside down by piracy.</p><blockquote><p>“In 2021, 2022, 2023, they’re looking at it more from the point of view of subscription and streaming models and the change to economics that happens when you move from selling things one at a time to selling things through subscription services. So they seem to spend a lot of time thinking about the music industry.”</p></blockquote><p>The focus on unauthorized file-sharing systems like Napster as a threat to ebook publishers overshadows the eventually successful, legitimate market for digital music. Today, music labels can distribute copies of music on platforms like Apple’s iTunes and Amazon’s MP3 Store and independent music sites like Bandcamp. These sites all sell music files to consumers, yet the publishing industry appears to have ignored these models in favor of more platform-based licensing approaches such as Spotify. While the experience of individual artists has varied significantly, the fact that the music industry has managed to stay afloat despite the loss of physical storefronts and albums, benefitting from new platform streaming models that depend on user subscriptions, digital ads, and data collection, has had an impact on the publishing mentality.<sup tabindex="3" id="5sOaYes191ZnjqKEValesZ"></sup></p><p>“Music went through some bumps, but now I would say the music industry is in a pretty great state, right?” an executive at an ebook subscription service platform said. “Between Spotify and Apple Music, there’s still a lot of subscription revenue out there for music. So I think there may be some bumps in the road in embracing the escription model, but I think that in the long run it’s going to be much better for the [publishing] industry for everyone to just embrace it.”</p><p>In some ways, fears that are discussed in the context of the music industry may really be anxiety about change more broadly. Multiple study participants that maintain professional relationships with major publishers recall publishers’ long-term reluctance to embrace the ebook format simply because it was outside their comfort zone.</p><h3 id="publishers-interpret-changes-in-copyright-law-as-an-opportunity-to-shut-down-secondary-markets">Publishers Interpret Changes in Copyright Law As An Opportunity to Shut Down Secondary Markets</h3><p>Courts have not settled on how to treat digital ownership, and publishers are taking advantage of this unresolved legal issue. The advent of digital technology has complicated and obfuscated the distinction between sales and licenses for digital goods.<sup tabindex="3" id="58Vjpmcw8E5n3RIIzg6ogk"></sup> One reason that copyright is so complicated online is the way digital goods are copied. When physical books are copied, it is easy to quantify and track those copies. Each copy can be counted, lifted, stacked, and stored on a tangible shelf. Digital copies are much harder to quantify and track.<sup tabindex="3" id="bMfumoE1jIG86ijrATfdC"></sup> With digital technology, there is rarely, if ever, a single copy of a work, even when the work is sold. Copies bought on CD or DVD are then loaded into the memory of a laptop computer. Downloads purchased via the cloud end up stored locally on a phone or tablet and across numerous cloud servers.</p><blockquote><p>This rhetorical shift from ‘selling’ individual copies on digital media to ‘licensing’ a collection of multiple copies for use in digital memory began to obfuscate who controlled the digital item that was sold to the consumer.</p></blockquote><p>Digital copies, even those purchased lawfully, often required a temporary instance of the software to be loaded into digital memory. As a result, copyright owners began to claim that a copyright license for these additional copies was needed to cover the copies of the work that existed in computer memory.<sup tabindex="3" id="CGOCeiF6XxOYfqGaVU7sM"></sup> This rhetorical shift from “selling” individual copies on digital media to “licensing” a collection of multiple copies for use in digital memory began to obfuscate who controlled the digital item that was sold to the consumer.</p><p>Even the notion of a “copy” soon became more metaphysical than physical in the world of digital content. The existence of a single “copy” became illusory, especially as modern computer storage systems learned to fragment even single files into thousands or millions of “shards” so they could be stored efficiently across various memory locations. Those same systems can make multitudes of ephemeral copies of files in the process of achieving mundane tasks like displaying the page of an ebook on a screen. Even if a consumer could argue that they owned the “copy” they bought, the tough question soon became: Where exactly is this copy? And how does the consumer find it if they want to resell it, lend it, or even give it away to a friend or family member?</p><h3 id="courts-begin-to-weigh-in">Courts Begin to Weigh In</h3><p>US courts struggled with how to think about the notion of a digital copy, and how to distinguish between a digital sale and a digital license. While some early courts were able to draw a distinction by analyzing a CD or DVD sale as controlled by copyright law and the installation of the digital content on a computer governed by whether a separate “contract” existed between the seller and the buyer, later courts could not make such clear-cut distinctions between copyright, which is governed by the First Sale Doctrine, and contract law-bound ownership arrangements, which are not.<sup tabindex="3" id="1uFAyHE8q3XvuAGVjv6hdG"></sup></p><p>In the summer of 2010, the US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals heard three different copyright appeals, all of which turned on the notion of whether or not a consumer who had purchased or been gifted a digital copy could make independent uses of that copy against the wishes of the copyright owner. The first case was <i>UMG Recordings, Inc. v. Augusto</i>.<sup tabindex="3" id="UsKUWVAiXDee2KtwhdOt8"></sup> The major record label UMG had a practice of sending unsolicited promotional (“promo”) CDs to DJs and other music fans. Troy Augusto, an entrepreneurial CD collector, would lawfully purchase used promo CDs and resell them, even though they often had a label on them stating “Not for Resale.” The second case was <i>Vernor v. Autodesk</i>, a similar case in which Tim Vernor bought and resold used copies of Autodesk’s architectural software program, AutoCad.<sup tabindex="3" id="1QozKvR57TqRWRKIadhKaa"></sup> Finally, in <i>MDY v. Blizzard</i>, the court heard a case as to whether purchasers of Blizzard’s World of Warcraft (WoW) video game infringed its copyright when they used a third-party “bot” program to autopilot their videogame characters through menial tasks in the game, a practice which Blizzard had forbidden in its game rules.<sup tabindex="3" id="2sEA7d6eJLclsIgZQszcc5"></sup></p><p>In each of these cases, questions of digital ownership were central. Despite the similarities among the fact patterns, the same three judges decided all three cases differently. Augusto emerged victorious, the court deciding that the lawful recipient owners of the promo CDs had a legal right to give their CDs to anyone and, thus, he had a legal right to resell them as he pleased. Vernor, on the other hand, was out of luck. The court decided that the Autodesk license was somehow stronger than the “Not for Resale” label on the CDs, and that digital software, oddly, was in some way inherently different from digital music, without saying exactly how. And in <i>MDY</i>, the court went a third way, saying that depending on the license term and language, the consumer sometimes had a right to use the software as she liked, and other times, she didn’t. It appeared that the terms copyright holders attached to digital media were important, although it remained unclear exactly how the power of terms interacted with the rights of users.</p><p>Then, in 2018, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals gave its own gloss on digital ownership. In <i>Capitol Records v. ReDigi</i>, the court considered whether a consumer who “bought” digital music songs from Apple’s iTunes Store had a right to resell them, and relatedly, whether the online marketplace ReDigi could help facilitate such sales.<sup tabindex="3" id="3qPqpqsS5zY2lmfztH2Tac"></sup> Here, the battle over rhetoric, technology, and copyright law reached a fever pitch. On the one hand, ReDigi had engineered a system that ensured the transfer of a music file securely from the seller’s computer to the purchaser’s without any extra copies being made. On the other hand, because the transfer was done through ReDigi’s cloud-based service, the transfer process involved making multiple intermediary copies of the original file, including the final copy on the purchaser’s computer. In deciding the case, the court interpreted this second digital location as a “copy” of the file, instead of a relocation of the original file from one computer to the other. And as such, that made the buyer’s copy an infringing reproduction of the song instead of a resale of the buyer’s copy.</p><p>All of this conflicting case law left quite a state of confusion for what it means to “own” digital goods. To some degree, that is still the case. The Supreme Court, to its credit, has tried to clarify in both a copyright case involving internationally sold used books and a patent case involving the reselling of printer toner cartridges that the First Sale Doctrine means just that – copyright and patent owners get to set the terms only the first time they sell a copy that contains their work.<sup tabindex="3" id="5KfLwIkGfYmGTushxvv4g8"></sup> But, because neither case was entirely digital in nature, the conflict and confusion between the Supreme Court’s approach and cases like ReDigi, MDY, Vernor, and Augusto remains.<sup tabindex="3" id="5qu03W33IWLkp7Rg6ACaTW"></sup></p><p>The vast majority of publishers have since taken advantage of this confusion, and have begun to insist that approaches like Vernor, which maximize the control that license terms can have on users, represent the current state of the law.<sup tabindex="3" id="1GjTKHfhzNhbmevQUg0Djc"></sup> What the US courts or Congress will ultimately decide on these issues and how that will impact digital ownership of ebooks remains to be seen. In the meantime, publishers continue to move forward on building a walled garden for ebooks built on licenses and technological limitations for consumers and cultural institutions.</p><h3 id="digital-distribution-changes-the-economics-of-book-production">Digital Distribution Changes the Economics of Book Production</h3><p>Another murky area of the ebooks analysis is what it costs to publish an ebook. Is it more expensive to publish paper or electronic copies of books? Publishers sometimes claim that it is expensive to publish an ebook, but concrete numbers about how much ebooks cost to produce are hard, if not impossible, to find. Although reliable empirical data is limited, ebooks appear to be relatively inexpensive to produce when compared to physical books. One participant from a Big Five publisher stated simply that “Ebooks are easy to create in a form that everyone accepts as acceptable.” What that means, according to one digital sales representative at a Big Five publisher, is that the people who work on ebook files have to “design the file in such a way that it recognizes what device it’s being rendered on. We make sure that [the file] can be rendered on that device.”</p><p>This individual went on to explain that when file formats are not fully compatible across devices, text can display with unwanted spaces and characters that take away from the user’s experience. “When a book is designed, believe it or not, it’s like a work of art. We actually have book designers who actually design how fonts look on a page.”</p><blockquote><p>A lot of our effort in print is dedicated toward optimizing that in terms of, you know, the paper that we acquire, the printing, space, transportation, shipping. None of that is required for ebooks.</p></blockquote><p>A participant from a trade publishing association had a more nuanced view that comes across as more critical of the process: “Generally people see digital books as more expensive, but I would argue that they are not in terms of prep work, and that when it’s more expensive it’s because your workflow wasn’t built to support multiple outputs…. I’m keenly aware of what happens with digital formats when you first start trying to do them. You create a separate workflow with separate processes, you make more mistakes, things don’t work out, and then they kind of become calcified.”</p><p>According to an independent publisher, “If it’s a book with text, it just means creating a flowable epub file, which is not hard. If it is an illustrated book, then a fixed format epub is usually created, unless the publisher wants to pay extra for fancy features and custom coding.” Flowable epub files work across platforms because they are responsive and the text works and “reflows” in whatever device it’s being used on.<sup tabindex="3" id="2KodjMstv8sQpaHHayRcOx"></sup></p><p>The relative economy of ebooks may also flow from the fact that ebook files are created once at the time of initial publication and then distributed in response to demand. One Big Five publishing house employee noted the inefficiencies inherent in the physical book distribution model when compared to ebooks: “A lot of our effort in print is dedicated toward optimizing that in terms of, you know, the paper that we acquire, the printing, space, transportation, shipping. None of that is required for ebooks.”</p><p>The economy of ebooks can also make hits especially profitable when, as a study participant from a trade association confirmed regarding ebooks, “the marginal cost is closer to zero.” A former Big Five executive also seemed to confirm this thought: “In an ebook, there’s no variable cost at all once you set up the system, right? You can put one book through, 100 books through, 50,000 books through. No additional cost, you’re just transferring files.”</p><p>Even if a book is a bust, there are still cost savings when publishers are dealing with the ebook format. In ebook publishing, there are no unsold copies. Publishing industry norms allow bookstores to return any unsold copies of a book to the publisher. In those cases, the publisher has paid to create the book, ship the book to the bookseller, return the book to the publishers, and destroy the copy. These costs do not exist when ebooks are distributed on demand.</p><h2 id="ebooks-reduce-the-friction-in-library-lending-raising-concerns-for-publishers">Ebooks Reduce the Friction in Library Lending, Raising Concerns for Publishers</h2><p>In addition to music industry-related fears, publishers are afraid that libraries lending ebooks will undermine the publishing business in a way that paper book lending doesn’t. Although some argue that ebook licensing helped increase access to broad digital collections during the COVID pandemic, ebooks and ebook licensing also limit the content and distribution of libraries’ collections.</p><p>In addition to visiting libraries to pick out paper books to take home, library patrons also use their library cards to access ebooks through websites that are made by third-party vendors and accessible on library websites. Instead of owning or controlling books, libraries sign digital library “access agreements” with companies like Hoopla, which select which ebooks library patrons can access and decide the terms of that access and lending for the libraries.<sup tabindex="3" id="X2SzzYATpNzUkOTdI0CtO"></sup> These types of arrangements with ebook platforms worry library workers, who feel their roles are being replaced by the new vendors, or eliminated entirely. Other ebook platforms like OverDrive do let librarians handle decisions around collection development for ebooks because libraries can pick and choose individual titles. However, the same cost and restrictions still apply to librarians that use OverDrive.</p><h3 id="publishers-worry-that-patron-lending-may-undermine-sales">Publishers Worry That Patron Lending May Undermine Sales</h3><p>Publishers worry that one-click access through libraries will discourage readers from purchasing books. One participant from a Big Five publisher in digital explained, “What is the difference between, you know, say, there’s a new book coming out, and a customer has a choice to buy it on Amazon or log on at home and download it from their library for free? There’s much more incentive to download it for free and if there’s no limit to whether that book is available…. we don’t want everyone who wants to read [the] book knowing that they can get it through the library the same day and date of the release and they don’t sell anything at all.”</p><p>Publishers made a similar point in their lawsuit against the Internet Archive’s Controlled Digital Lending program. “The convenience of library ebook lending – particularly the ability to check out ebooks instantaneously, anytime and anywhere – makes it a highly attractive proposition to consumers who might otherwise purchase ebooks.”<sup tabindex="3" id="5oKAXkxc91zraVEgXpAcXh"></sup></p><p>This concern is often described as a lack of “friction” compared to physical book lending. It is rooted in the view that the ease of accessing books on ebook platforms like OverDrive’s Libby is now roughly equal to the ease of purchasing those same ebooks.</p><blockquote><p>For the consumer, borrowing a free ebook from a library’s website, on the one hand, or obtaining it from Amazon or other e-retailers, on the other hand, are extremely similar experiences, except that one is free and one is not.</p></blockquote><p>Participants associated with the publishing industry often drew a contrast between the similarity of the ebook purchasing and lending experiences on one hand, and the differences between the physical book purchasing and lending experiences on the other. However, those comparisons often exclusively attributed burdens to lending physical books that exist for purchasing physical books as well. For example, travel time and the possibility of a book not being available was often cited as a point of friction in library lending, while being essentially ignored for bookstore purchases.</p><p>A former executive at a Big Five publishing house used this framework to describe the friction involved with lending physical books: “If I’m a consumer in the old days, I could buy a book in the bookstore and read it. Or I could get in the car, drive down to the library instead of the bookstore, look to see if they had it. Check it out. If I hadn’t finished it in two weeks, I was going to have to bring it back. I was gonna forget to bring it back. I was gonna have to pay a fine. Oh, my kid lost it. Where the hell did that book go? Now I’m gonna get charged for the goddamn book and I don’t even have it.” While the post-check-out friction is specific to libraries, everything up to that point would also apply to the bookstore experience.</p><p>This concern was echoed by the senior VP of Grand Central Publishing (an imprint of Hachette) in the Internet Archive Controlled Digital Lending litigation. “We believe that the ‘friction’ involved in checking out physical books from libraries – the delays when a popular book is not available, the time and costs associated with traveling to the library to check out a physical book – may motivate some library patrons to purchase their own copy rather than check the book out from the library.”<sup tabindex="3" id="20h5i3xiZVVhUD70DR0DGM"></sup></p><p>While participants from the publishing industry often drew sharp contrasts between the lending and purchasing experience of physical books, they highlighted the similarity between lending and purchasing ebooks. The same executive continued: “Perhaps most importantly, the convenience of ebook lending – particularly the ability of users to check ebooks out instantaneously anytime and anywhere – makes it a highly attractive proposition to consumers who would otherwise purchase books instead of going to the library. Critically, the experience of checking out a library ebook is functionally identical to downloading a copy from Amazon.”<sup tabindex="3" id="5zYrriZsPe9AHjS7cRM317"></sup></p><p>The chief digital officer at HarperCollins drew the same connection. “For the consumer, borrowing a free ebook from a library’s website, on the one hand, or obtaining it from Amazon or other e-retailers, on the other hand, are extremely similar experiences, except that one is free and one is not.”<sup tabindex="3" id="2YpILzCnx0apDyH4wgswqu"></sup></p><p>A senior VP at Wiley expanded: “An ebook would be capable of far more efficient reproduction and distribution than a print book, allowing it to serve exponentially greater demand.”<sup tabindex="3" id="4YIq12OkVXepdXDxZI4aCZ"></sup></p><p>Publishers are also concerned that library lending of ebooks will “train” readers that the value of ebooks is zero. This fear of training in the ebook market appears to be more acute than in the physical book market because of the publisher perception that ebook lending and purchasing is more similar than physical book lending and purchasing. The same former publishing executive explained: “And then the final significant danger is the deterioration in value. And that comes primarily through library lending. Right? The library lending issue is very difficult because it educates a whole group of people that books are essentially free.”</p><p>This concern about “free” books is echoed in the publishers’ complaint against the Internet Archive’s Controlled Digital Lending system: “[B]y providing copies of digital books for free, [the Internet Archive] devalues the book market. Consumers begin to view works as cheap and become increasingly unappreciative of what it takes to produce them and unwilling to pay fair value for them.”<sup tabindex="3" id="1TFjLvcnq1g6fUdGT8XwuG"></sup> This concern is not unprecedented – music platforms have been similarly critiqued for devaluing the artists’ and labels’ labor.<sup tabindex="3" id="1ZJHBBcOZ6UwPwkjwqgKxe"></sup></p><p>The former publishing executive worries that nobody will buy ebooks if they can get an identical copy for free from a library. “And that lowers the amount of cash that comes into the system, which lowers the author’s advances, which makes it more difficult to be a publisher, and eventually makes it very difficult to make a living writing books.”</p><p>In conversations with participants, it was not always clear why publishers tend to view library copies of ebooks as “free.” Although these copies are free to patrons, they are available to patrons because libraries have purchased them from publishers. Increased patron demand for individual titles would encourage libraries to purchase additional copies from publishers. Publishers highlight that library acquisitions contribute to profits in their complaint against the Internet Archive’s Controlled Digital Lending program: “Harm to and loss of community support for public libraries, in turn, hurts the publishers, since these libraries pay for their books, which, in turn, hurts authors, who share in and depend upon compensation for their copyrights.”<sup tabindex="3" id="2yVTe92N7eKA9CF4hLXPev"></sup></p><p>In that same proceeding, one executive touted the growth of revenue in the library ebook market. “In fiscal year 2015, library ebook licenses in the United States constituted 2.3% of HarperCollins’ total US ebook revenue. By fiscal year 2020, that share grew substantially to 7.4% and reached 12.9% of all US ebook revenue by mid-2021. (HarperCollins’ fiscal year ends June 30.) Indeed, as of mid-2021, HarperCollins earned over $19 million in revenue from library ebook licenses in the United States, which was nearly twice as much revenue as we earned from library ebook licenses in the United States during FY 2020.”<sup tabindex="3" id="71P3eFvQ803Nbf8CZ4z85U"></sup></p><p>It is not entirely clear how publishers understand the relationship between library acquisitions and retail sales. In a declaration that is part of the Internet Archive Controlled Digital Lending litigation, one publishing executive described conclusions he drew from OverDrive circulation data (the data and analysis itself was filed under seal). “While library ebook circulations made up 50% of the total units downloaded of trade ebooks between 2017 and 2020, ebooks obtained by libraries which resulted in those circulations brought in only 13% of total ebook revenue for Hachette…. The data discussed above has led Hachette to conclude that readers who were previously purchasing retail ebooks are switching to library ebooks, which means that we lose retail sales to free borrows.”<sup tabindex="3" id="1PkGpLgY9EiYEscceyywpR"></sup> Left unexplored in the publishers’ public analysis was how many of those library loans they believed replaced potential retail sales, how many loans per ebook publishers would view as reasonable, and how many loans per ebook libraries expect when deciding to pay for ebook access in the first place.<sup tabindex="3" id="pK3fwomnxxBS4uyBhAxFH"></sup></p><p>In one podcast, a Macmillan executive alleged that people used libraries to get around buying books: “I have a friend right now who has 11 library cards, never waits for a bestselling book, used to spend $500 a year on books.”<sup tabindex="3" id="3S6SCUF2PM0iX8gacpvFf4"></sup> Study participants affiliated with the publishing industry were often quick to point to that type of lost revenue when discussing library ebook lending in interviews.

Participants from the publishing industry often noted during our interviews that paper books tend to degrade physically, especially when they are shared.<sup tabindex="3" id="7JOgHcrpnjMJG2y0ZnK1JJ"></sup> This was often contrasted with ebooks, which were commonly described as lasting in perpetuity.<sup tabindex="3" id="1cW5Z6qd28GZND7g3Arznh"></sup> This industry understanding of the relative durability of books and ebooks – regardless of its veracity – raises questions about how to think about the value of a single copy of a book, in either physical or electronic form.</p><p>The physical fragility of paper books created an opportunity for publishers to resell copies of a popular title multiple times, especially to libraries, where books go through a lot of wear and tear as they are read by numerous patrons. As a former Big Five publishing executive explained, “Physical books fall apart. And they actually fall apart reasonably fast. Physical books get lost. Physical books don’t get returned to the library. So the library has to keep ordering the book every once in a while; think how many times your local library has ordered up Pride and Prejudice. Right? Since it was published. They’ve ordered a lot of copies of that book.”</p><p>The same former executive contrasted the fragility of physical books with ebooks: “Digital file, oh, that lasts forever. They buy it once, it lasts forever.” Another executive simply asserted that an ebook “does not degrade.”<sup tabindex="3" id="35svVqvuoS82YrXVdVk2tg"></sup></p><p>While this sentiment was common among participants, it is unclear how accurately it reflects real-world dynamics. Popular physical books may wear out quickly, but copies of other titles remain in a library’s collection for years, decades, or even centuries, waiting for the occasional patron interest. When it comes to digital, publishers have demonstrated that they can create licensing schemes that require libraries to re-purchase books at a regular interval, or after a certain number of patrons check them out.<sup tabindex="3" id="3mIGj2FW3ptR3xvKhX6kUr"></sup></p><p>Furthermore, as anyone who has ever tried to open a digital file that is more than a few years old may know, the “forever” nature of digital copies is far from proven. The Internet Archive has described the work involved in maintaining its digital collection, in that it “processes and reprocesses the books it has digitized as new optical character recognition technologies come around, as new text understanding technologies open new analysis, as formats change from djvu to daisy to epub1 to epub2 to epub3 to pdf-a and on and on. This takes thousands of computer-months and programmer-years to do this work.”<sup tabindex="3" id="6heQph82laQx73JsgLN1Et"></sup></p><p>It may be relevant that the nature of this degradation is not identical between physical books and ebooks. Physical books tend to wear out in a way that correlates with their popularity. The most popular titles wear out quickly, while less-popular titles may last in perpetuity (or at least until the acidic compounds in the paper they are printed on destroys them). In contrast, ebooks tend to become less accessible over time. All titles grow obsolete at the same rate, and all may disappear if the platform distributing them goes out of business. As that happens, the most popular titles may be the only ones that are replaced.</p><p>Regardless of their rate of decay, some libraries may devote resources to maintaining their digital collections, just as some libraries may devote resources to maintaining their physical collections. However, other libraries could adopt the same strategy for replacing outdated ebooks that they already use for worn-out physical books: purchase new copies.</p><h3 id="concentration-and-consolidation-make-it-easier-to-push-the-market-in-publishers-favor">Concentration and Consolidation Make It Easier to Push the Market in Publishers’ Favor</h3><p>The changes in copyright law and technological realities have been unfolding against a backdrop of continued concentration within the publishing industry itself. This consolidation of power among publishers made it easier to avoid competitive pressures that may have prevented the ebook market from evolving in a way that is so different from the physical book market. It has also given publishers leverage in the ebook market to force libraries to follow their lead.

While bookstores play an important part in that market, the First Sale Doctrine tends to limit their permanent influence: A bookstore’s relationship with a physical book ends the moment that it is sold. Deciding to shop at a new bookstore does not involve re-purchasing all of the books you purchased from others.</p><p>Balancing interests in the ebook market is more complex. In addition to publishers and readers, ebook platforms have ongoing interests in how ebooks are created, distributed, and controlled. Those interests exist independently from the interests of publishers and readers. Licensing allows ebook platforms to exercise that influence in an ongoing manner. In many (although not all) cases, publishers and platforms find their interests aligned when it comes to shaping the ebook market. This publisher-platform partnership rebalances the playing field in the ebook market, tilting things away from purchasers and toward the publishers and platforms.</p><p>The result is an ebook market that is designed to support the preferences of publishers and platforms, at the expense of the interests of the purchasers. It replaces sales and ownership with licenses tying ebooks to both publishers and platforms in perpetuity. These perpetual ties also create new opportunities for publishers and platforms to monetize reader data by spying on ebook readers.</p><p>While locking purchasers into platforms serves some interests of both publishers and platforms, that lock-in has unique impacts on publishers, platforms, and purchasers.</p><h3 id="digital-rights-management-technology-creates-lock-in">Digital Rights Management Technology Creates Lock-In</h3><p>Licenses are the legal tools that platforms and publishers use to control how purchasers can use ebooks. Digital Rights Management (DRM) is the primary technical tool used to implement that control, sidestepping first sale rights. Publishers and book platforms use DRM to prevent consumers from downloading, saving, sharing, and other common first sale-permitted activities. DRM tools make it very hard, if not impossible (and possibly illegal),<sup tabindex="3" id="2zOrbrYQlZRJ3xApJnfQCb"></sup> for users to move the ebooks in their collection between platforms and ereaders.<sup tabindex="3" id="6qNR8fDNkIHGNYyA5nEjeS"></sup> If a consumer licenses access to a book on Kindle, they cannot open that file on a NOOK, or on any other platform or app.</p><p>The full motivations behind implementing DRM are not always entirely clear. Many participants connected DRM with concerns about large-scale piracy.<sup tabindex="3" id="55z8DKxsx1YZ2ztsRMQ9XU"></sup> At the same time, they also noted approvingly that DRM would prevent casual lending between friends. (One publishing executive even stated that DRM played an important role in ensuring that local library spending benefited local members of the community.)<sup tabindex="3" id="46N7NktJ3BMUVUsDUMID6"></sup></p><p>While sometimes conflated by participants, stealing books and sharing books are distinct activities in the world of physical books and first sale. Printing and distributing multiple, unauthorized copies of a physical book would violate the copyright in that book. In contrast, sharing the single copy of the book you purchased with a friend would be well within your rights under copyright law.</p><p>Although the DRM benefits both publishers and platforms by reducing purchaser control over ebooks, participants suggest that the use of DRM is driven primarily by publisher demands. None of them suggested that DRM was being driven solely by the platforms. Applying DRM is a major condition for publishers to work with ebook platforms at all.</p><p>“From a retailer perspective, we still believe it’s the publisher’s problem and not so much ours,” a digital director at an ebook platform company said. “If the publisher says, I will not give you these books unless you get with the times [and implement DRM], let’s say the industry is going in a certain direction. So then we would have to do software updates to support that. But we as a retailer are not driving that decision. We would just support where it goes.”</p><p>While DRM may be driven by publisher demands, it benefits platforms as well. Several participants agree that customers get hooked into ebook platforms and say the inability to easily transfer ebook files between different platforms, particularly with Amazon, makes it difficult for customers to switch between platforms, leading to a further concentration of market share among a few dominant players.</p><p>“With ebook, there’s Digital Rights Management on ebooks so you just don’t have the cross-pollination across platforms that one would hope for,” one participant said. “If you buy from Kindle, you cannot play it on a NOOK, you cannot play it on a Kobo device, so when you’re in the ecosystem of a company, that’s pretty much where you stay.”</p><p>Participants’ mixed views on the purpose of DRM tracked responses reported by industry analyst Mike Shatzkin over a decade ago. In an informal survey of “[n]ine very high-level executives in seven different top dozen publishing houses, plus four literary agents with extremely powerful client lists,” Shatzkin reported that “[e]leven of the 13 agreed with me that DRM is necessary to protect sales. Ten of the 13 agreed with me that DRM is not an effective deterrent to piracy. And 12 of the 13 agreed with me that DRM’s main benefit is to prevent casual sharing!”<sup tabindex="3" id="5tGZBKwelDVIiZctoVEkdG"></sup> Respondents then, and study participants today, understood that DRM’s practical effect was preventing the type of casual sharing between friends that is allowed under the First Sale Doctrine, and that DRM is not an effective anti-piracy measure.</p><p>One participant, who is an executive at an ebook platform company, explained how DRM is meant to limit the legal transferability of ownership, and not just prevent illegal piracy. “Nobody wanted there to be a secondary market for ebooks, and I think mostly because nobody could imagine how you would control it or because you’re dealing with perfect replicas, like how do you ever keep that in the box?” the participant explained. “So the focus was on maintaining the perimeter through DRM, rather than a focus on ownership structure that could just prove to be impractical to try and enforce.”</p><blockquote><p>The DRM placed on ebooks, when combined with ebook licensing schemes’ limitations on first sale uses, can collapse the distinct activities of ‘lending’ and ‘piracy’ into a single violation of the license.</p></blockquote><p>The DRM placed on ebooks, when combined with ebook licensing schemes’ limitations on first sale uses, can collapse the distinct activities of “lending” and “piracy” into a single violation of the license. In doing so, the DRM, and licensing limitations, can use the pretext of preventing an illegal activity (large-scale copyright infringement) to restrict a legal activity that has long been disliked by some publishers (loaning a copy of a book to a friend).</p><p>One participant at a Big Five publisher explained it like this: “We want customers to be able to read the book, to keep the book forever. What we don’t want [is] to have someone take that ebook file and then share it with 10,000 other friends for free.”</p><p>During the Internet Archive Controlled Digital Lending proceeding, the senior VP for Online and Digital Sales at Penguin Random House also conflated the ability to lend an ebook to a friend with worldwide piracy: “If the ebook could be shared among devices belonging to multiple users, the cost would be significantly higher to reflect the broader distribution. And the price to purchase an ebook file, without restrictions on its further use or distribution, would be utterly unaffordable as a practical matter given that it could potentially satisfy global ebook demand for that title.”<sup tabindex="3" id="6RY1T53kuKgcmq7BwntNLa"></sup></p><p>Copyright law prohibits a single user from sharing a single ebook with 10,000 friends. DRM does as well. However, only DRM prohibits a user from sharing a single ebook with a single friend.</p><p>The concern that individuals lending books might undermine sales was explicitly described by other participants as well. “So I think it’s a conflicted sense around whether ebooks are good for publishing and good for the industry and whether or not they’re kind of providing the basis for either undermining sales because of consumer sales by making it easier to lend and sometimes undermining sales because of piracy,” said the participant from the trade book association.</p><p>As another participant in the digital side of one of the Big Five publishing houses explained, “[publishers] license because they want to make sure there is an artificial lifespan on the file, and an artificial cap on the sharing of that file.”</p><p>Many participants appeared to believe that DRM does effectively prevent unauthorized copies of ebooks from appearing online. A former executive at a Big Five publishing house explained that “If there weren’t enough protections, and the plain fact of the matter is, you know, 50 or 60% of the books out there were pirated, readily available for free, essentially, copyright would be gone.”</p><blockquote><p>Whatever other benefits DRM may bring to publishers, publisher insistence on applying DRM to ebooks has also undermined the development of a more-competitive platform landscape.</p></blockquote><p>Another participant in a director role at a platform company echoed this sentiment: “Once a book is out there in the world, there’s nothing to stop it from going viral. Especially, certainly, you’re never going to see that happen with a John Grisham or James Patterson [book]. … There’s no way that they would make that DRM free.”</p><p>Both of these doomsday descriptions fail to account for today’s reality in which the majority of DRM-protected ebooks are already illicitly available online.</p><p>Other industry players appear to have less confidence in DRM as an anti-piracy tool. In January 2023, International Publishers Association (IPA) President Karine Pansa claimed that the fear of unauthorized distribution of ebooks was keeping entire regions out of ebooks despite the existence of DRM: “In Africa and the Arab world, we hear publishers saying that they won’t shift to digital because the risk of piracy is too great and their copyright enforcement regimes want to protect them.”<sup tabindex="3" id="3a0UJykiQ5dALijA91wiR0"></sup></p><p>Regardless of its actual effectiveness as an anti-piracy measure, DRM has effectively reduced readers’ freedom to own the books they pay for.</p><p>Finally, DRM creates a somewhat striking dynamic between publishers and the platform companies. Whatever other benefits DRM may bring to publishers, publisher insistence on applying DRM to ebooks has also undermined the development of a more-competitive platform landscape. It is notable that even though there are clear benefits to platforms when DRM is used to lock purchasers into specific walled gardens, the industry consensus is that the use of DRM is driven by the publishers themselves. Publishers’ decades-long focus on eliminating the secondary market may have led them to insist on technology that locked them into a handful of platforms.</p><h3 id="platform-companies-use-walled-garden-infrastructure-to-make-purchaser-and-publisher-lock-in-profitable">Platform Companies Use Walled Garden Infrastructure to Make Purchaser and Publisher Lock-In Profitable</h3><p>Ebook platforms lock in publishers and purchasers by building digital walled gardens, while simultaneously collecting data from both parties. Ebook platforms lock in publishers with their distribution agreements, and they lock in users by allowing people to see ebooks only on the platform where they were originally purchased (and prohibiting downloading, sharing, and other off-platform access).<sup tabindex="3" id="xVB8NhUhuQXEYXR6cs5a9"></sup> This lock-in is in the interest of platforms, and creates some benefits for publishers. However, when it comes to walled gardens, the long-term interests of publishers and platforms may not be fully aligned.</p><p>Platforms leverage license agreements that prevent purchasers from taking their books outside the digital garden walls. This makes platforms sticky to purchasers. Once a purchaser has one ebook on a platform, they are likely to return for a second, third, and so-on. That allows platforms to convert their walled garden structure into increased ebook sales.</p><p>Ebook platform lock-in has specific impacts on libraries. Some platform schemes require libraries to pay for bundles of publications instead of picking out their own books. Before digital content was provided on internet-connected platforms, libraries had robust “collection development” teams tasked with reading through book reviews, advertisements, and other recommendations to curate their library collections title-by-title. That old model has been replaced by the modern digital platform model, in which a continuous stream of “content” is available on every library visitors’ “feed.”<sup tabindex="3" id="5UZk7DDpvxowZfnKqrofVq"></sup> In public libraries, these content collections can contain titles that are downright offensive or incorrect – in 2022, some librarians noticed that Hoopla, an OverDrive competitor, was platforming Holocaust denial propaganda and books containing incorrect information about reproductive healthcare, LGBTQIA issues, and other similarly problematic works.<sup tabindex="3" id="7ficU5VTjzXcL19BhxuP5I"></sup></p><p>As one collections development librarian at an academic library told us, this purchasers’ mindset discourages libraries from sharing digital resources and developing unique collections: “Every single library that I know of was just throwing money at the problem [during the pandemic]. Like, fine, we’ll get all of the Project Muse ebooks. Fine, we’ll get all of the JSTOR ebooks. And so we just funneled money into these publishers, but we couldn’t actually be like, okay, [my library’s] buying all of Johns Hopkins so that Yale can buy all of JSTOR and we’ll just lend. Like we couldn’t do that. We all just bought the same stuff and that’s terrible from a collection development standpoint.”</p><p>This study participant believes academic libraries are united in thinking this approach isn’t working, to the point that some university librarians are turning their collection focus back to purchasing print books: “Because [print books are] a for-sure thing, like there’s a physical object. We can lend that physical object,” the study participant added.</p><p>Libraries may choose not to participate in the ebook market because of what they perceive as restrictive, and sometimes seemingly exploitative, terms of use. The platform providers tack on digital bells and whistles to the items they sell, like product-related metrics, customer ratings, and algorithm-driven “see more like this” options. These data analytics and algorithmic features add value to the copyrighted material by giving consumers extra information about the content they’re viewing, but they are also tools for publishers to assert more control over the materials they provide to consumers. By embedding add-ons into items that used to be sold outright, publishers can claim that the raw material of their publications are inseparable from the platforms and metadata they’re attached to.<sup tabindex="3" id="3GvJoVhGUNLAuJtH1mI8Uh"></sup></p><blockquote><p>Walled garden platforms are uniquely poised to provide their owners (or those with access to their data) a ‘God’s-eye view’ of their consumers’ habits, preferences, and decision-making tendencies.</p></blockquote><p>As discussed in more detail below, these features are also tools for personal data collection and use. Walled garden platforms are uniquely poised to provide their owners (or those with access to their data) a “God’s-eye view” of their consumers’ habits, preferences, and decision-making tendencies. Publishers can use customer ratings and other consumer feedback to intuit what particular users will want, based on their data, and predict what they will buy in the future, and to decide what books to publish and what prices to charge.</p><h3 id="publishing-platforms-also-lock-in-publishers">Publishing Platforms Also Lock In Publishers</h3><p>Platforms don’t just lock in readers. They also lock in publishers. Market-dominating platforms like Amazon and OverDrive have emerged as obligatory content middlemen that publishers must cooperate with in order to have their books seen by most consumers. According to one estimate, Amazon leads the US ebook market with around 81% of the market share in 2020.<sup tabindex="3" id="6sbFyZJL9WFG1z18ckd2oq"></sup> OverDrive claims at least 90% of public libraries in the US and Canada as clients.<sup tabindex="3" id="1E9f5oEtKxIrkQnHcXtjnT"></sup></p><p>Participants regularly described how the limits of Amazon’s market-dominating Kindle, in particular, undermined economic incentives to innovate.</p><p>“We would want to create better versions of children’s books, you know, something that has, like, better picture quality, better audio, whatever. But Amazon’s devices don’t support audio. So immediately you just can’t have a read-along children’s book,” explained one participant from a Big Five publisher.</p><p>Another participant from a trade association echoed that sentiment: “That’s one of the reasons why ebooks suck. They don’t really take advantage of the medium at all [and] the least common denominator is Kindle. It’s kind of a black-and-white provisioning – Amazon doesn’t even fully support accessibility for print-disabled audiences. We could be doing a lot more with digital formats. But we’re not because the primary distribution mechanism, Amazon, you know, 80% of the market, doesn’t really care about innovation in the ebook market. And as a result, we kind of puddle along.”</p><p>In part, this dependence on third-party platforms is because many publishers prefer to outsource the process of creating and supporting ebook files to third parties. A director of an ebook distribution platform explains that ebook distribution is “just not [the publishers’] focus. Like, they’d have to create a whole structure like an ecomm [an ecommerce platform]. And some of them will have it, like [Penguin Random House] has it but, you know, an e-comm structure that gets supported and iterates… it’s a business, it’s a massive undertaking, quite honestly. And if their focus is to bring content to the world, and make some money off of it, it’s a distraction.”</p><p>Another participant working at a Big Five publisher agreed: “It just wasn’t feasible, like the amount of time and effort put into developing and maintaining the site or a space where customers can redeem their files from, really did not represent the actual sales that we were getting through those stores.”</p><p>Amazon, and other popular consumer platforms for ebooks, use their power in the ebook market to directly contradict publisher preferences. They offer publishers’ books for prices below their retail price, making it harder for publishers to recoup their publishing costs.<sup tabindex="3" id="6X9zXy9SCd7GcIXxm4x1UU"></sup> They also leverage the consumer data they collect on their platforms to prevent competing platforms from taking hold in the market,<sup tabindex="3" id="4VJm3doJQAR9FFxjVkC4bi"></sup> and they have even created their own self-publishing services that route authors away from the traditional publishers, setting up a new, rival publishing industry.<sup tabindex="3" id="4RQjZ7KIMVIK9247aMtCSe"></sup></p><p>“There’s a lot of issues tied up with the publishing industry’s relationship with Amazon, and it’s a difficult subject to speak on,” a journalist on the book industry beat said. “I’m not gonna guarantee that someone’s not going to burst through my door here and put a bag over my head and throw me in the back of the van [for agreeing to participate in this research study].”</p><p>This ownership of the ebook customer base can also give platforms like Amazon control over which books readers discover in the first place. “The ways that you would make a decision about how to buy those books feel like they’re much more controlled by the apps and what the apps recommend to you, as opposed to like, this author recommends it and it got this review,” one study participant, who wishes to remain anonymous, said. One participant with a market research group pointed out that data about consumer behavior tends to stay with the platforms and not be shared with the publishers.</p><p>“Unlike Elsevier, they don’t have a good view into [data]” the participant said. “The platforms that do own themselves… Those guys can and do use data like that to optimize their catalogs.But the publishers themselves don’t have visibility into that. And the main players like Kindle will never share it. So [publishers] are kind of at a disadvantage in that respect.</p><p>Platforms can also disrupt existing publisher-purchaser relationships. In 2020, the Association of American Publishers, the Authors Guild, and the American Booksellers Association wrote to the House Antitrust Subcommittee to urge the government to step in and provide more oversight to protect the publishing industry from Amazon.<sup tabindex="3" id="Ne43M8fWJE5j5yuWhYZzX"></sup> The publisher organizations blamed Amazon for not competing on a “level playing field when it comes to book distribution,” and claims that the ebook giant “owns and manipulates the playing field, leveraging practices from across its platform that appear to be well outside of fair and transparent competition.” And because the company is the dominant platform for so much of the ebook market, publishers have no choice but to try to make the relationship work, even though Amazon exploits them.</p><h3 id="publishers-and-purchasers-explore-creating-their-own-platforms">Publishers and Purchasers Explore Creating Their Own Platforms</h3><p>Both publishers and purchasers have attempted to sidestep some of the challenges presented by independent platforms by creating their own.</p><p>There is some evidence that at least some publishers see the value in developing their own ebook distribution platforms. Both Simon &amp; Schuster and Penguin Random House pride themselves on developing robust ebook creation and distribution pipelines. According to one participant familiar with the operation, Simon &amp; Schuster is beginning to see smaller publishers leave relationships with OverDrive and enter into distribution agreements with them instead. Direct ownership over its own ebook distribution could help Simon &amp; Schuster avoid problems that arise when its interests do not align with the interests of platforms.</p><p>There are also examples of institutional purchasers working to create their own platforms. New York Public Library (NYPL) is one of the only public library systems in the country to launch its own library lending app, which one NYPL employee said became an important initiative for reinstating contact with patrons.</p><p>“Our patrons were seeing content, content was being promoted to our patrons, that is not stuff that we would necessarily have promoted,” one NYPL employee familiar with the project said. “We were getting concerned about what that relationship looks like. Sometimes we would hear patrons talk about how, you know, they check things out from Libby [an app from OverDrive]. Well, they actually check things out from NYPL, through Libby. We were starting to lose some of that connection. [NYPL developed its own platform because] we wanted to have more control over the relationship with the patrons but also with the publishers.”</p><p>This fear of disintermediation was echoed by the publishers in their complaint against the Internet Archive’s Controlled Digital Lending program. “[Internet Archive’s] website undercuts public libraries by disintermediating them.”<sup tabindex="3" id="1Ps9GouC1NiY4yeGtksICH"></sup></p><h3 id="publishing-platforms-offer-new-benefits-to-readers-and-publishers">Publishing Platforms Offer New Benefits to Readers and Publishers</h3><p>While the platforms impose limitations on both purchasers and publishers, they also provide benefits. Ebook platforms give readers a reprieve from the performative aspects of reading a physical book in public. It’s no wonder romance fiction is one of the top ebook genres, according to study participants familiar with general purchaser habits and trends. Ebooks also have a functional appeal for some reader demographics, a director at a leading market research company explained: “Older readers tend to really like them because they can do things like have larger font sizes, they can adjust the font, they’re easier to read for people who have or are starting to have issues with their vision.”</p><p>A book industry consultant also talked about the distinction between ebooks with plain text versus ebooks with pictures and features like hyperlinks: “Ebooks have functional capabilities that print books do not have.”</p><p>Platforms offer services that keep customers coming back. For writer Louryn Strampe, Kindle’s built-in dictionary was particularly helpful when rereading a book like Gravity’s Rainbow.<sup tabindex="3" id="qtc7xl491bCT7G0UUCnJW"></sup> Other readers value knowing that an ebook listed by a platform is always available.</p><p>“They’re never out of stock,” the consultant said. “They’re never out of print. You can always deliver the next one.”</p><p>The platforms also aggregate customers and titles, increasing convenience for consumers and drawing them to books they may not ordinarily see in the course of their physical shopping errands. On digital platforms, consumers can access a particular ebook, song, or video while also interacting with elements of the online store. Consumers can shop online, browsing algorithmically curated digital collections instead of merely getting a singular, pre-selected item; personalize the items they’ve bought by creating online annotations and filing systems to hold their favorite products; leave comments and have conversations with other shoppers; and rate and rank the items they’re perusing.</p><p>While some platforms invest deeply in algorithmic recommendation and curation, other platforms intentionally avoid relying on these tools.</p><p>“Because we’re a bookseller, I think we have good curation,” one director at an ebook platform company said. “The stores are already making lots and lots of decisions every day on what they want to get behind and what’s important to the company and the idea of elevating certain writers that we think should be elevated. … Ebook, in a lot of ways, just follows what the larger goals are.”</p><p>At the same time, it is important to disentangle the benefits of platforms as a concept from the version of platforms that exist today. There is no reason that easy digital access to books must be paired with proprietary file formats that prevent customers who purchase books from bringing them elsewhere, or transferring them to someone else. There is also no reason that digital access to books must involve data extraction from consumers for marketing and other commercial purposes. Almost all platform features could also function in a world where customers owned their ebooks and were free to bring them to (or remove them from) platforms as they saw fit, without having to worry about the privacy and use of their ebook data. Similarly, there are many examples of digital goods that are sold, not licensed, online.<sup tabindex="3" id="m5PVnkYYWUgsS31uO2Yxa"></sup></p><h2 id="monetizing-data-and-tracking-users-provide-additional-incentives-for-publishers-and-platforms-to-retain-control">Monetizing Data and Tracking Users Provide Additional Incentives for Publishers and Platforms to Retain Control</h2><p>Platforms don’t just let publishers license instead of sell ebooks or lock consumers into particular walled gardens. They also create entirely new money-making opportunities in personal data and data analytics markets. While both publishers and platforms are attempting to use and monetize this data, platforms appear to be more aggressively invested in its use.</p><p>Locking readers into platforms generates data that was formerly impossible to collect. Today, platforms are able to gather location data on users, both in terms of what page they’re on and where they’re using their device. This is in stark contrast to what publishers or bookstores can track when a customer walks out the door of a bookstore with a paper book in hand. That book sale transaction has ended at the point of sale, making it impossible to know if they read the book at home, on a plane, or in a hospital. It’s impossible to know whether a reader lingers on a particular page. It’s impossible to know if a reader recommends the book to their friends. All of this data can now be harvested from ebook platforms.<sup tabindex="3" id="1q0K7nNfJtnivbmyvdFz6W"></sup></p><p>That data can be especially valuable when combined with other data and sold through data brokers. Data brokers specialize in collecting personal data or data about companies and selling or licensing that information to third parties for any number of reasons. Personal data collection and sale is a multibillion -dollar business. Data brokering, sharing, and sale to advertisers, companies, and even public institutions is a ballooning nascent business. Ebook platforms give publishers the opportunity to participate in the personal data industry. Many platforms are already there.</p><p>Ebook platforms require customers to provide personal information in order to access ebooks. This information can include your name, address, digital payment information, and whatever other personal data points the platform owner wants. Once you start using the platform, your every move on the platform becomes a data point that could be collected. While it’s not clear what types of data various platforms collect, people have discovered that Amazon tracks every time a user taps their Kindle ebook reader,<sup tabindex="3" id="3eBaVaJaexHKxnZXgV0xqj"></sup> and companies like Gale sell data analytics that tell libraries what decisions to make by “blending ebook and audiobook vendor data” with “segmentation and lifestyle data.” Gale’s ebook reader data is specific enough to mark readers’ locations on a map and provide information including their estimated household income and how many children they have.<sup tabindex="3" id="5Fs002ahHekafEKsRq7zRh"></sup></p><p>Consumer data is valuable, both to ebook platforms, and as a separate saleable item that ebook platforms and publishers can barter and sell with others. As one journalist with experience covering the topic put it: ebooks really give Amazon a wealth of customer data. “It really helps build out a customer profile, and I think that’s one of the major things that Amazon has going for it that publishers don’t, and that libraries don’t, because Amazon owns the customer. They own the customer profile. They own the data, and that’s just a huge part of how the digital environment functions.”</p><p>Platform services are a conduit for consumer data, allowing companies to track their consumers’ choices. Ebook platforms can track consumers, not just at the point of sale and beyond, but before sales occur on the platform. The companies can lead consumers to products based on their personal online habits and prior choices.</p><p>It’s no surprise that ebook platforms are following most other industries and infusing their ebook readers and ebook selection platforms with internet-connected data collectors. While it’s not clear how or if trade publishers will use this type of data, academic publishers are learning how to leverage readers’ data to manipulate the pricing of their ebooks, depending on who is using them, and by generating metrics that predict how impactful various publications will be.<sup tabindex="3" id="6Cyp7CD2CnyFwTVJzFlpUf"></sup></p><p>Ostensibly, when an ebook provider can see exactly what every one of its customers does with each of its products and services, it can use that data to understand what consumers want, even before the consumers themselves know what they want.<sup tabindex="3" id="3vJxjt8y11UkQrr6sLu1Rf"></sup> This data can also distort what books are published, replacing human editorial evaluation of new works with data-driven decisions that act to replicate what has succeeded in the past.<sup tabindex="3" id="1YD6S1YNj2oZDtFO4MVrej"></sup> Today, “Publishers can know that you raced through a novel to the end, or that you abandoned it after 20 pages. They can know where and when you’re reading. On some reading sites and apps, users sign in with their Facebook accounts, opening up more personal data.”<sup tabindex="3" id="4mYkSLIwXCJS6iKNVap1on"></sup> But it’s not always the case that the companies that run the platforms are sharing the data they collect with publishers. For instance, companies including Amazon and Apple are not sharing user data with publishers.”<sup tabindex="3" id="4oEK8OA2XdqVdT9WoTaPXK"></sup></p><p>Other publishing industries, including the academic publishing industry and the legal information industry, have figured out how to use readers’ data to build new, profitable data “insights” to sell to industry consumers. The publishers have gleaned data from their users on their journal and legal information platforms, and used their consumers’ data to develop “academic metrics” and “legal insights” data products.<sup tabindex="3" id="7BDcmQPjLef8tUw2B2Veja"></sup> These products predict which scholars’ projects will be the most lucrative and tell lawyers how particular judges are likely to react to their arguments based on their troves of personal data and other copyrighted informational troves (news, academic journal articles, court opinions, etc.). These other publishers have figured out that if you combine information from the materials you provide on your platforms with personal data from the consumers who use those platforms, you can derive brand-new information products to sell.</p><p>But these types of products are not yet prevalent on trade ebook platforms, nor are they guaranteed to appear on those platforms in the future. “I think academic publishing, the Elseviers of the world, are not easy models for trade publishers to look at but they’re useful ones,” one participant from a book trade association that deals with standards and policy said. “We think about these things a lot, even though we have a trade publishing bias in our membership. The reality is that we’re always thinking across the industry, we have to. And I think that it will come. My job is to hopefully have it come at a time and with capabilities that support a transition to a different way of working because I don’t want it to disrupt book publishing, I want to help book publishing get better and bigger.”</p><p>Regardless of how ebook publishers and platforms are using their licensees’ and platform visitors’ data, they understand the potential value of that data and can see how academic publishing has created an entirely new data analytics market (selling author metrics, sales predictions, etc.) that is a multibillion-dollar industry.<sup tabindex="3" id="4TUo215E3ORPop3aOcZdBQ"></sup> Ebooks platforms will likely, eventually, learn how to harness the profit opportunities of “big data.” It is less clear if the publishers themselves will follow suit.</p><h3 id="publishers-are-working-to-use-reader-data">Publishers Are Working to Use Reader Data</h3><p>Most ebook platforms are already collecting myriad customer data. It is harder to understand exactly how publishers are using the data they have access to, which may only be a portion of the data collected by platforms. In our current data privacy law regime, nothing requires the companies collecting our data to tell us what data they are collecting or what they are doing with that data.

The book company is actively seeking employees who can “[build] upon the latest results from the academic research community.”<sup tabindex="3" id="5pDcTGpFioMrnwDAnPZYyT"></sup></p><p>Trade publishers have been slower to integrate data analytics into their own publishing decisions, and to find ways to monetize data analytics by selling them to interested customers (book vendors, writing programs, entertainment companies, etc.). When publishers were focused on selling paper books, information about consumers’ online behavior was more relevant to the digital retail platforms that sold their books than the publishers themselves.<sup tabindex="3" id="ygrva6QBdiU1mTiUUNoLT"></sup> Today, “… taking ownership of reader data appears to be increasingly important to publishers.”<sup tabindex="3" id="3Kf8EaAXsulTfQAiYoYHA3"></sup> Data analytics are being developed to do more useful work for publishers, making tools that can help target readers and predict publishing market trends.</p><blockquote><p>It seems trade publishers haven’t consistently been able to figure out the best way to harness data analytics and are not yet using them as primary determinants in publishing decision-making, nor are they reselling them to the extent that academic publishers are.</p></blockquote><p>One 2018 study of publishers reflected their moves to utilize personal data analytics in their marketing strategies. All of the big publishers had started using website analytics and social media metrics on top of the traditional “point-of-sale” data collected by Nielsen BookScan.<sup tabindex="3" id="3lHaxXco8rvfdAPVhLM8gv"></sup> A 2016 report focused on how Penguin Random House UK was using data analytics to “paint a detailed picture” of their readers, and to sort them into categories to “connect the right readers with the right books” based on their “attitudes, behaviors, and motivations.”<sup tabindex="3" id="4tZqHzsH4rJSdDMxrQlSEJ"></sup> This data analytics work allows publishers “to sidestep the time-consuming, costly, and often haphazard work of identifying or creating a unique audience for each and every title in their catalogs.” One independent publisher said, however, that “it’s really hard to take shortcuts here” because each book and each author is so different. The publishers who can afford robust data analytics tools use them to “inform how [they] acquire books,” pick their publications, and market them.</p><p>Much of the data analytics used by publishers is still not at the level used by retail platforms like Amazon. It seems trade publishers haven’t consistently been able to figure out the best way to harness data analytics and are not yet using them as primary determinants in publishing decision-making, nor are they reselling them to the extent that academic publishers are. This is especially true for smaller publishers. Large publishers are investing more in data analytics as part of their marketing strategies.<sup tabindex="3" id="5dkUiIQgS04KELn13ll8ls"></sup></p><p>In fact, it seems that it is still relatively difficult to obtain current, accurate data on book sales and other publishing data.<sup tabindex="3" id="7D66QxYkjvT3XPUKFJmgpS"></sup> It also seems that, currently, data does not necessarily guide many of the decisions within the industry. In discussing the use of data with participants who work for and with publishers, a distinction emerged between marketing and production data on one hand, and manuscript evaluation on the other.</p><p>“This is a business that’s 500 years old,” said one participant from a trade association. “You know, even in the US and the current model, it’s close to 100 years old. And the reason is that we don’t use data. I mean, we just don’t really think about it. People, you kind of do shortcuts and shorthands.”</p><p>Manuscript evaluation was regularly described as something that existed outside of the world of data. “No one wants to believe that a machine can read a book and tell you anything about the book,” the same participant said. “This is what editors do. And it can only be done in an analog way reading one manuscript at a time. And you know a good book when you see it. And that’s the only way to choose a book.”</p><p>This sentiment was echoed by one former Big Five executive: “Their editors, senior editors, executive editors, publishers, and it’s all sort of intuitive, right? So it’s a business based on intuition.”</p><p>Instead of being used at the core of publishing and editing choices, data is being used for manufacturing and marketing decisions. Online tracking allows publishers to trace the journey from ebook to newsletter signups. “We also have links where it’s like, sign up for our mailing list and newsletters. We also track that to see how many customers actually, you know, subscribe to our mailing lists for ebooks,” said one Big Five employee.</p><p>One former executive leader at a publishing house explained how this information actually shaped manufacturing choices: “But to me, it should be about making the back-end efficient, making good decisions based on real data as opposed to oh, I feel really good this morning so I think I’m going to spend more money. The enhancing ability to run a productive business, you bet. How many books should we print? Human intuition should not enter that. How many orders do we have? What’s the rate that we’re selling the book at? What are the channels of distribution? Here’s how many we’re going to print, here’s the cost of the book. Here’s how long it takes us to go back to press on this type of book. Here’s the cause of piles. Man, that’s a very complex decision. Actually, do we reprint this book right now? Sometimes [it’s] really easy. But when it’s a tough decision, it’s really tough. And you need lots of data.”</p><p>There are places where marketing and manuscript evaluation can overlap. One participant on the digital side of one of the Big Five described a system where branded cookbooks could be quickly created in response to industry trends. The publisher maintained a content management system with 10,000 recipes that could be repurposed and repackaged, “They would see like, you know, okay, this Stranger Things is trending or, you know, like, which, suddenly, a lot of like witchy products are trending. So let’s make a witchy cookbook.”<sup tabindex="3" id="01yNGi0V517imOQr8kPLym"></sup></p><h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2><p>All ebook stakeholders understand that licensing terms, DRM, and walled garden platform infrastructure place additional controls on how ebooks are used. They simply disagree as to whether or not those limitations improve or degrade the ebook economy, ecosystem, and experience.</p><p>This disagreement can be context specific. For example, a former Big Five executive’s explanation for why he does not use Spotify for his music may also resonate with concerns that others have expressed about having to license ebooks: “I don’t do Spotify and all that stuff. I do [individually purchased tracks through] Apple Music. Because I put it on my machine, and I do some of it through the cloud, then what I do is, every few years, I take a machine, and I take it offline, and I have my music. So I can always then put that back on my computer and have my music. Because you know, what happens if, I don’t know, a weather event wipes out a significant amount of the server farms in the United States? Oh you’re not gonna be able to get your stream of music or stream of anything else. And you see what Apple does with music is fantastic, right? They, in the new terms that you sign on in order to have your iTunes and all those songs you bought over the last 25 years. They have the right to swap out versions and they do it all the time. So suddenly your favorite acoustic version of that song that you love and you’ve been listening to for 20 years, you put it on and it’s a different song. It’s the same song, but it’s a different performance. They just swap it out. So there is that issue of ‘do I actually own it?’”</p><blockquote><p>The stakeholders in the world of ebooks are all working toward rational goals, whether it’s growing a business, expanding access to knowledge, or simply wanting to read in private. Legal and technological changes have created a new market structure that tends to privilege the interests of publishers and platforms over those of purchasers and readers.</p></blockquote><p>The concern about swapping out versions of songs has direct parallels in ebooks.

Fortunately, some straightforward interventions may help preserve the benefits of ebooks, protect against stakeholder concerns, and bring the relationship between publishers, platforms, and purchasers into historical balance.</p><h3 id="regulators-should-address-competition-concerns-and-barriers-to-entry-for-the-ebook-marketplace">Regulators Should Address Competition Concerns and Barriers to Entry for the Ebook Marketplace</h3><p>As this paper and other research shows, the shift to publisher-platform partnerships and the accompanying switch from sales to licensing have steadily gained both momentum and intensity in recent years. While there is no direct evidence to suggest explicit coordination, the increasing concentration in both the publishing and platform markets for ebooks, coupled with the massive simultaneous shift from sales to licensing, raises important questions about the nature and extent of any implicit or explicit coordination. For example, the near-universal refusal to offer individual or institutional consumers the option to legally own an ebook at any price raises the possibility that some agreement might be responsible.</p><p>The absence of this option, on top of publisher-platform-reader lock-in, whereby access to books is prohibited on other platforms, could create substantial barriers to entry for new participants.</p><p>Two solutions can address these problems. One is to mandate that any ebook purchased should be delivered in a format that allows interoperability between ebook reading platforms. This would allow both purchasers and publishers to shift from platform to platform depending on which ones offer them the most competitive and preferred treatment, including new entrants to the market. The second solution is to mandate that vendors offer the option to “buy” ebooks (as opposed to rent/stream/license or more “temporal” transactions). This would require vendors to offer the ebook with the incidents of digital ownership, including the right to preserve the copy they buy, resell it, and be free of surveillance while they read it.<sup tabindex="3" id="71963W19xRWdR4zOVDQOO6"></sup></p><h3 id="economic-examinations-of-the-ebook-market-should-distinguish-between-the-market-for-digital-ownership-of-ebooks-and-the-market-for-platform-controlled-licensing-of-ebooks">Economic Examinations of the Ebook Market Should Distinguish Between the Market for Digital Ownership of Ebooks and the Market for Platform-Controlled Licensing of Ebooks</h3><p>At the same time that publishers have been investing more heavily in ebook platforms and less in traditional ebook sales, they are suing one library, the Internet Archive, for offering ebook loans under a system called Controlled Digital Lending (CDL).<sup tabindex="3" id="7DIkkqi8ervoPlNMVVBh5E"></sup> CDL is a special system for library ebook lending that uses technology to follow a first sale framework. For example, libraries can lend out only one ebook copy at a time for each physical copy of the book they own.<sup tabindex="3" id="2VmQYmd8FkpBczcvcGre6K"></sup> This “owned-to-loaned” ratio simulates the economics of first sale for physical library books, where each physical book owned can be loaned to only one patron at a time. CDL is currently being implemented by a wide range of libraries in a wide range of ways.</p><p>The reasons behind the CDL lawsuit may be related to publishers’ ongoing belief that library loans cost them profits, and that shutting down digital library loans will recoup those losses. As noted in this paper, that belief was shaped by a physical book environment where readers were choosing between purchasing a book from a bookstore or borrowing a functionally identical copy of a book from the library.</p><blockquote><p>The complexities of these platform economics raise serious questions about how digital library lending, especially under a CDL approach, competes with current publisher business models.</p></blockquote><p>However, the ebook marketplace looks very different from this physical book model. Bookstore ebook sales are a small and diminishing part of the market. Instead, licensed copies distributed via surveillance-driven platforms dominate the market, generating revenue from individual and bulk purchases, as well as subscriptions, advertising, and data analytics. The complexities of these platform economics raise serious questions about how digital library lending, especially under a CDL approach, competes with current publisher business models. This ambiguity is particularly relevant to the Internet Archive lawsuit, as one of the four “fair use” factors at issue in the case is the effect of CDL on the market for the books being lent out. The greater the difference in the economic model of digital ownership versus platform-controlled licensing, the less market harm publishers can prove.</p><h3 id="digital-ownership-should-be-normalized-instead-of-publisher-refusal-to-sell-ebooks">Digital Ownership Should Be Normalized Instead of Publisher Refusal to Sell Ebooks</h3><p>The deals that vendors strike with libraries on behalf of publishers often come with nondisclosure agreements libraries are expected to sign, waiving their right to talk about the different deals vendors are able to score with different libraries. This anti-competitive practice discourages librarians from inquiring about the deals vendors make with other libraries to determine whether or not they are getting a raw deal. Through our interviews with different participants, we learned that some academic libraries are opting to return back to purchasing physical books as a way to get around the constraints of ebook licenses.</p><p>Academic publishers, including MIT Press, are looking at preservation in terms of perpetual access, even though public libraries, who are not frequent purchasers of academic press books, are more likely to concede to a perpetual access license because the mission of public libraries is more preservation-oriented. One source with a larger metro public library system said that it viewed perpetual access as a form of preservation if proper backups are in place: “If we’re licensing ebooks and we get a perpetual license to those ebooks, there’s always the threat that the company that’s licensing it to us goes down and we lose that access. So we’ve built some preservation requirements into these things that say that you the publisher actually have to deposit copies into escrow, and they sit on this server that we can’t access until or unless the company goes bankrupt. At that point, the server unlocks and now we get access to all this content that we actually paid for. But now we get to preserve it because the company that licensed it to us originally went away.” Whether more libraries can negotiate these types of contractual agreements depends on how well resourced the staff at each system is, as well as how this would apply to their specific collection priorities and needs.</p><h3 id="library-privacy-laws-should-be-updated-to-preserve-intellectual-freedom-on-ebook-platforms">Library Privacy Laws Should Be Updated to Preserve Intellectual Freedom on Ebook Platforms</h3><p>Academic publishers are already using purchasers’ personal data to assess researchers’ impact and to do other data analytics.

Many states have updated their library privacy laws to include email records and electronic book circulation trackers (associated with library card barcodes, etc.), but few have been amended to account for internet-connected ebook platforms and ereaders. Librarians have raised their concerns about the threats ebook platforms pose to their patrons’ intellectual freedom, but state legislators have yet to update the laws to reflect those concerns.<sup tabindex="3" id="2nof5tpEpFQ59C6PVr4kug"></sup></p><p>As we wait for data privacy legislation in Congress, states could update their library privacy laws to increase their scope, if they haven’t already done so.

<p>On behalf of the Thunderbird team, <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Modules/Thunderbird#Thunderbird_Council">Thunderbird Council</a>, our global community of contributors, and our extended Mozilla family, I am incredibly excited to announce the initial launch of Thunderbird 115 “Supernova” for Linux, macOS, and Windows! With this year’s version, we’re delivering much more than just another yearly release. Supernova represents a modernized overhaul of the software – both visually and technically – while retaining the familiarity and flexibility you expect from Thunderbird.</p>



<p>“Supernova is the beginning of a new era for Thunderbird,” says Ryan Sipes, Thunderbird’s Product and Business Development Manager. “It lays a beautiful, solid groundwork for future releases that will make Thunderbird a significantly better email client – and we won’t stop until it’s the best option out there.”</p>



<p>“During the past year we reworked some of the oldest parts of our code base with the goal of modernizing them to make maintenance and extensibility easier,” says Alex Castellani, Thunderbird’s Director of Product Engineering. “We did our best to strike a comfortable balance between new features and interface changes to appeal to new users, while maintaining the current layout and interface that millions of our users know and love. This is <a href="https://blog.thunderbird.net/2023/02/the-future-of-thunderbird-why-were-rebuilding-from-the-ground-up/">the first step</a> towards a more flexible, reliable, and customizable Thunderbird that will accommodate different needs, preferences, and workflows.”</p>



<p>Here’s a brief look at some of the best new features and improvements in Thunderbird 115. For the complete list, please visit <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/new-thunderbird-115-supernova">this support article</a>.</p>



<hr>



<h3>Modernized Cards View</h3>



<figure><a href="https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/115.png"><img decoding="async" width="1680" height="1050" src="https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/115.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/115.png 1680w, https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/115-252x158.png 252w, https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/115-600x375.png 600w, https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/115-768x480.png 768w, https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/115-1536x960.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1680px) 100vw, 1680px"></a></figure>



<p>Supernova’s new Card View is our version of the well-known vertical layout for the Message List, perfect for people used to modern webmail. Card View emulates a mobile interface list with multi-line support, offering a more comfortable appearance to reduce cognitive burden. (And because we want Supernova to feel familiar for veteran users, the legacy “Table” view is still available.)</p>



<h3>Brand New Thunderbird Logo</h3>



<p>Supernova ships with a brand new Thunderbird logo honoring our history and vital connection to Mozilla, while representing the revitalization of our brand and a promising, sustainable future.</p>


<div>
<figure><a href="https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/appmenu-default.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/appmenu-default.png" alt="" width="189" height="297" srcset="https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/appmenu-default.png 273w, https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/appmenu-default-252x396.png 252w" sizes="(max-width: 189px) 100vw, 189px"></a><figcaption>New Thunderbird AppMenu ≡</figcaption></figure></div>


<h3>Dynamic Unified Toolbar</h3>



<p>Supernova features a single dynamic toolbar, presenting frequently used and contextual options based on the tab or Space that is currently active. Take full control by customizing the toolbar and window layout to perfectly fit your workflow.</p>



<h3>Intuitive AppMenu</h3>



<p>The new Application Menu (≡) in Supernova is now keyboard-accessible, and redesigned for faster, easier navigation. Fewer submenus, persistent global options, and consistent iconography combine to create a much more intuitive experience.</p>



<h3>Improved Calendar Design</h3>



<figure><a href="https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/cal.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/cal.png" alt="" width="840" height="531" srcset="https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/cal.png 1554w, https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/cal-252x160.png 252w, https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/cal-600x380.png 600w, https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/cal-768x486.png 768w, https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/cal-1536x973.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px"></a></figure>



<p>As part of an ongoing effort to modernize and upgrade Thunderbird’s Calendar, Supernova introduces an improved “mini-month” layout, improvements to the day/week/month grid, a pleasing color palette, and several more minor changes.</p>



<h3>Elegant Density Control</h3>



<figure><a href="https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/Appmenu_Density@2x.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/Appmenu_Density@2x.png" alt="" width="596" height="596" srcset="https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/Appmenu_Density@2x.png 1400w, https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/Appmenu_Density@2x-252x252.png 252w, https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/Appmenu_Density@2x-600x600.png 600w, https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/Appmenu_Density@2x-160x160.png 160w, https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/Appmenu_Density@2x-768x768.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 596px) 100vw, 596px"></a><figcaption>Change your density setting and font size easily from the new AppMenu</figcaption></figure>



<p>Working with multiple monitors and display resolutions? Supernova lets you dial in the perfect density settings and font sizes for the entire application, with just a single click from the AppMenu.</p>



<h3>New + Sortable Folder Modes</h3>


<div>
<figure><a href="https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/folderpane.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/folderpane.png" alt="" width="218" height="528" srcset="https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/folderpane.png 284w, https://blog.thunderbird.net/files/2023/07/folderpane-252x610.png 252w" sizes="(max-width: 218px) 100vw, 218px"></a></figure></div>


<p>Supernova gives you more control by introducing sortable Folder Modes. Display all of your Tags in the Folder Pane, turn on and off Local Folders, or move your favorite Folder Mode sections up and down with one click. Less scrolling, more productivity.</p>



<h3>Eye-Catching Tags View</h3>



<p>Tags are a familiar and powerful part of your workflow, so Supernova adds an eye-catching “Tags” view to the Folder Pane. Quickly jump to your custom, color-coded tag categories to find and filter your messages even faster.</p>



<h3>Improved Address Book</h3>



<p>Supernova continues to iterate on the modernized Address Book introduced in Thunderbird 102. You’ll enjoy a new tabular view, an improved Edit view, delete buttons, and better accessibility.</p>



<h3>Better Accessibility</h3>



<p>Speaking of accessibility, Supernova substantially improves Thunderbird’s keyboard navigation and screen reader accessibility across the entire application. We’ve also greatly expanded the ability to navigate Mail content and buttons using the TAB and arrow keys.</p>



<h3>More To Come…</h3>



<p>Supernova is constantly evolving. Throughout the next year, we’ll deliver many improvements to existing Supernova features and introduce brand new ones, including Thunderbird Sync. Upgrade to version 115 and experience the future of Thunderbird!</p>



<hr>



<h3>How To Get Thunderbird 115 “Supernova”</h3>



<p>As with any major release, we sometimes become aware of corner cases after significant public testing. The Thunderbird team will wait to enable automatic updates until we’re confident no such issues exist. We’ll keep you posted right here, and on social media platforms. (Existing Thunderbird 102 users will continue to see security updates during this time).&nbsp;</p>



<p>On Linux, the timing of this release and subsequent automatic updates may be determined by your distribution’s maintainers. If it’s convenient for you, we recommend installing the <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/org.mozilla.Thunderbird">Thunderbird Flatpak from Flathub</a>, which is now packaged and maintained by the Thunderbird team.&nbsp;(Please note that 115 is <em>not </em>live on Flathub at time of publication, but as always we’ll keep you updated.)</p>



<p>If you don’t want to wait for an automatic update, Thunderbird 115 is also available to download directly at <a href="https://thunderbird.net/">thunderbird.net</a> for Windows, Linux, and macOS. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

                

                
                    
                        <p>Hey folks, welcome to the digest! Today’s issue is about a pain point developers encounter when shipping desktop-class apps to the browser.</p>
<h2>File editors and database apps</h2>
<p>Most desktop applications are what I call <strong>file editors</strong>.</p>
<p>By file editor, I mean that the user selects a file on disk, and the program loads it into memory. User changes are applied in-memory and periodically saved back to disk.</p>
<p>Most <em>web</em> apps, by contrast, are what I call <strong>database apps</strong>.</p>
<p>Instead of loading a whole file into memory upfront, database apps render views of the data by fetching data from a database as needed to render the UI. When the user makes changes to the data, those changes are persisted back to the database via API calls.</p>
<p>Database apps are a good fit for “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete" target="_blank">CRUD</a>” tools like calendars, todo lists, and tools with three-letter acronyms containing “manager” (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system" target="_blank">CMS</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management" target="_blank">CRM</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_information_management" target="_blank">PIM</a>).</p>
<p>One of the challenges of writing desktop-class software that runs in the browser is that file editors do not translate as naturally to the architecture of the web as database apps do.</p>
<p>To understand why these apps work differently, let's look at one.</p>

<p>The design tool <a href="https://figma.com/" target="_blank">Figma</a> is a good example of a file editor that runs in the browser.</p>
<p>When you open a Figma design, your browser downloads (over WebSocket) a “Fig file” corresponding to that design. The file contains binary data serialized with <a href="https://github.com/evanw/kiwi/tree/master" target="_blank">kiwi</a>. Kiwi is a binary format similar to Google’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_Buffers" target="_blank">Protobuf</a>, open-sourced by former Figma CTO Evan Wallace.</p>
<p>You can think of a kiwi file essentially as compressed JSON. Officially, the kiwi schema used by Figma is <a href="https://forum.figma.com/t/inquiry-about-the-fig-file-format/6351/2" target="_blank">undocumented</a>, but there have been some <a href="https://github.com/liaobinbin/fig-to-json/tree/main" target="_blank">attempts to reverse-engineer</a> it, and <a href="https://blog.photopea.com/photopea-4-6-open-figma-files.html" target="_blank">at least one third-party tool</a> supports it.</p>
<p>Translated to JSON by a third-party tool, it looks something like this:</p>
<p><img alt="image.png" src="https://buttondown.imgix.net/images/f751c5c0-e72e-4d9f-b855-752ff4a0627d.png?w=960&amp;fit=max"></p>
<h2>S3 as a filesystem</h2>
<p>Figma persists these Fig files to Amazon S3.</p>
<p>A naive approach would have been for the client to treat S3 like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System" target="_blank">network file system</a> and use it the same way a desktop app would use its local file system. This would have two problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>The whole file would have to be sent for every change, which is a waste of bandwidth as files get large.</li>
<li>Figma supports multiple concurrent users per document. If every change caused the entire document to be rewritten, race conditions from concurrent edits would cause data loss.</li>
</ul>
<p>Figma avoids both of these problems by taking a <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-figmas-multiplayer-technology-works/" target="_blank">more sophisticated approach</a>. When you open a Fig file, it’s actually loaded in two places: in your browser, and on a server.</p>
<p>Instead of writing back the entire file on each change, clients stream back only the changed data. The server applies those changes to its own in-memory copy to keep it synchronized.</p>
<p>The tricky part is that when multiple users open the same Fig file concurrently, Figma’s infrastructure needs to ensure that they are all connected to the same server. That server can then be the sole authority on the state of that document, and write to it without race conditions.</p>
<h2>Why not use a database?</h2>
<p>Figma <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-figma-scaled-to-multiple-databases/" target="_blank">stores file metadata</a> in a Postgres database. Instead of going to the trouble of using S3 too, they could have also used the database for document data, in one of two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>They could stuff the whole document into a binary blob or json(b) column next to the metadata.</li>
<li>They could represent the document itself as rows and tables in a relational database.</li>
</ol>
<p>#1 is essentially (ab)using the database as a file system, <a href="https://www.brentozar.com/archive/2021/07/store-files-in-a-file-system-not-a-relational-database/" target="_blank">which is bad</a>.</p>
<p>#2 at least has the aura of using the database <em>as a database</em>, but it adds a bunch of complexity to the application layer, which needs to be able to translate between a document representation in memory and a relational representation in the database.</p>
<p>In either case, another consideration at scale is that S3 can be 10-100x cheaper byte-for-byte than a database. The query capabilities available in a database come at the cost of computational overhead, and it’s a waste to pay that overhead when you have a known, file-like access pattern.</p>
<h2>Durability</h2>
<p>Writing the whole document to S3 is relatively slow, so Figma only does it every 30-60 seconds. But if the system responsible for writing those checkpoints fails (say, the power goes out), Figma doesn’t want to lose 30-60 seconds worth of changes. So they <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/making-multiplayer-more-reliable/" target="_blank">buffer changes</a> at a higher frequency by saving them to DynamoDB, as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write-ahead_logging" target="_blank">write-ahead log</a>.</p>
<h2>Generalizing Figma’s approach</h2>
<p>This post came out of research we’ve been doing towards building an open-source document database that takes a similar approach.</p>
<p>Recently, we introduced <a href="https://docs.jamsocket.com/locking-a-backend-to-a-resource/" target="_blank">“locking”</a> into Jamsocket and <a href="https://plane.dev/" target="_blank">Plane</a>, which can guarantee that at most one backend runs per document, motivated by desire for a Figma-like data architecture.</p>
<p>If these problems resonate with problems you’ve experienced building browser-based apps, please drop me a line by replying to this email, I’d love to learn more about the problems you’ve encountered.</p>
<p>Until next time,</p>
<p>Paul</p>

<p>Yesterday, Congress members revealed the <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Attacks%20on%20Tax%20Privacy_Formatted.pdf">results</a> of a seven-month investigation into tax-filing companies. Lawmakers found that H&amp;R Block, TaxAct, and TaxSlayer "recklessly shared" potentially hundreds of millions of taxpayers' sensitive personal and financial data with Google and Meta "for years" in apparent violation of laws prohibiting tax preparers from sharing tax return information without customers' consent.</p>
<p>In a press release provided to Ars from the office of Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), lawmakers alleged a "massive, likely illegal breach of taxpayer privacy." Insisting upon urgent redress, lawmakers are now calling upon the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Federal Trade Commission, and the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration to "fully investigate this matter and prosecute any company or individuals who violated the law."</p>
<p>The Congress members' report said that "any tax return preparer who 'knowingly or recklessly discloses'" tax return information "is subject to a fine up to $1,000 per violation, and a prison term of up to one year."</p>
<p>"The companies shared millions of taxpayers’ tax return data, meaning they could face billions of dollars in potential criminal liability," lawmakers wrote in a <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2023.07.11%20Letter%20to%20IRS,%20TIGTA,%20FTC,%20DOJ%20on%20tax%20prep%20pixel%20data%20sharing.pdf">letter</a> to federal agencies.</p>
<p>For its investigation, congressional staff interviewed representatives at tax-filing sites, as well as at Meta and Google. These interviews uncovered what their report said was "a troubling pattern and practice of data sharing by tax prep companies, a complete lack of corporate responsibility and accountability on the part of tax prep companies and Big Tech firms, and a potentially illegal use of sensitive taxpayer information."</p>
<p>"Under the law, 'a tax return preparer may not disclose or use a taxpayer’s tax return information prior to obtaining a written consent from the taxpayer,'" lawmakers' letter said.</p>
<p>The only exception allows for data sharing with "auxiliary service providers" working "in connection with the preparation of a tax return." However, lawmakers said that "Meta and Google likely do not meet the definition of 'auxiliary service providers,'" partly because "the data sharing with Meta was for advertising purposes—not 'in connection with the preparation of a tax return.'"</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The congressional probe followed a bombshell <a href="https://themarkup.org/pixel-hunt/2022/11/22/tax-filing-websites-have-been-sending-users-financial-information-to-facebook">report</a> from The Markup in November 2022, revealing that tax-filing websites had been sharing customers' sensitive financial information with Meta. After being contacted by The Markup, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/11/major-tax-filing-websites-secretly-share-income-data-with-meta/">all three tax-filing websites confirmed</a> that they'd removed or disabled the Meta Pixel tracking tools that were gathering sensitive data.</p>
<p>But while tax-filing websites were quick to stop collecting data, nobody's sure how much information was collected. One unnamed company told Congress that "every single taxpayer who used their websites could have had at least some of their data shared."</p>
<p>Lawmakers in their letter called tax prep companies "untrustworthy and incompetent." Attempting to research if tax prep companies had gained consent to disclose and use data from its users, Congress was blocked by the companies, who refused to "provide current and historical versions of disclosure agreements and privacy policies." Undeterred, Congress consulted Internet archives to access historical versions of company policies and pieced together that none of the companies appeared to have gained consent from their customers to share the sensitive data with Meta and Google.</p>
<p>TaxSlayer and H&amp;R Block did not immediately responded to Ars' request to comment, but a TaxAct spokesperson told Ars that the company cooperated with lawmakers and works to protect user privacy.</p>
<p>"TaxAct has engaged with Senator Warren and her staff to provide transparent, detailed explanations on our use of these standard analytics tools," TaxAct's spokesperson told Ars. "TaxAct has always complied with laws that protect our customers’ privacy and, as noted in the report, we disabled the tools in question while we evaluated potential concerns. Protecting the rights and privacy of our customers is our top priority, and we are committed to engaging with stakeholders to address any concerns and to help advance public policy."</p>
<p>A Meta spokesperson told Ars that Meta stands by a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/11/major-tax-filing-websites-secretly-share-income-data-with-meta/">statement provided to Ars</a> last year, saying that “advertisers should not send sensitive information about people through our business tools. Doing so is against our policies and we educate advertisers on properly setting up business tools to prevent this from occurring. Our system is designed to filter out potentially sensitive data it is able to detect.”</p>
<p>A Google spokesperson told Ars that the company has "strict policies and technical features that prohibit Google Analytics customers from collecting data that could be used to identify an individual. Site owners—not Google —are in control of what information they collect and must inform their users of how it will be used. Additionally, Google has strict policies against advertising to people based on sensitive information.”</p>

<p dir="auto">This is a tutorial stack to create and host AI companions that you can chat with on a browser or text via SMS. It allows you to determine the personality and backstory of your companion, and uses a vector database with similarity search to retrieve and prompt so the conversations have more depth. It also provides some conversational memory by keeping the conversation in a queue and including it in the prompt.</p>
<p dir="auto">It currently contains companions on both ChatGPT and Vicuna hosted on <a href="https://replicate.com/" rel="nofollow">Replicate</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">There are many possible use cases for these companions - romantic (AI girlfriends / boyfriends), friendship, entertainment, coaching, etc. You can guide your companion towards your ideal use case with the backstory you write and the model you choose.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong> This project is purely inteded to be a developer tutorial and starter stack for those curious on how chatbots are built.

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Quickstart</h2>
<p dir="auto">The following instructions should get you up and running with a fully
functional, local deployment of four AIs to chat with. Note that the companions
running on Vicuna (Rosie and Lucky) will take more time to respond as we've not
dealt with the cold start problem. So you may have to wait around a bit :)</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">1. Fork and Clone repo</h3>
<p dir="auto">Fork the repo to your Github account, then run the following command to clone the repo:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="git clone git@github.com:[YOUR_GITHUB_ACCOUNT_NAME]/companion-app.git"><pre><code>git clone git@github.com:[YOUR_GITHUB_ACCOUNT_NAME]/companion-app.git
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Alternatively</strong>, you can launch the app quickly through Github Codespaces by clicking on "Code" -&gt; "Codespaces" -&gt; "+"
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3489963/252566402-eb954517-29f2-44b7-b9ca-4184dcf42806.png"><img width="458" alt="Screen Shot 2023-07-10 at 11 04 04 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3489963/252566402-eb954517-29f2-44b7-b9ca-4184dcf42806.png"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">If you choose to use Codespaces, npm dependencies will be installed automatically and you can proceed to step 3.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">2. Install dependencies</h3>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="cd companion-app
npm install"><pre><code>cd companion-app

<p dir="auto">e. <strong>Supabase API key</strong> (optional)
If you prefer to use Supabsae, you will need to uncomment <code>VECTOR_DB=supabase</code> and fill out the Supabase credentials in <code>.env.local</code>.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Create a Supabase instance <a href="https://supabase.com/dashboard/projects" rel="nofollow">here</a>; then go to Project Settings -&gt; API</li>
<li><code>SUPABASE_URL</code> is the URL value under "Project URL"</li>
<li><code>SUPABASE_PRIVATE_KEY</code> is the key starts with <code>ey</code> under Project API Keys</li>
<li>Now, you should enable pgvector on Supabase and create a schema. You can do this easily by clicking on "SQL editor" on the left hand side on Supabase UI and then clicking on "+New Query". Copy paste <a href="https://github.com/a16z-infra/ai-getting-started/blob/main/pgvector.sql">this code snippet</a> in the SQL editor and click "Run".</li>
</ul>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">4. Generate embeddings</h3>

<p dir="auto">Now you are ready to test out the app locally! To do this, simply run <code>npm run dev</code> under the project root.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can connect to the project with your browser typically at <a href="http://localhost:3000/" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:3000/</a>.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">6. Additional feature: Text your companions</h3>
<p dir="auto">You can assign a phone number to the character you are talking to and retain the full conversational history and context when texting them. Any user can only start texting the AI companion after verifying their phone number on Clerk (you can do this by clicking on your profile picture on the companion app -&gt; Manage Account -&gt; Phone Number). Below are instructions on how to set up a Twilio account to send/receive messages on behalf of the AI companion:</p>
<p dir="auto">a. Create a Twilio account.</p>
<p dir="auto">b. Once you created an account, create a Twilio phone number.</p>
<p dir="auto">c. On <a href="https://console.twilio.com/" rel="nofollow">Twilio dashboard</a>, scroll down to the "Account Info" section and paste <code>Account SID</code> value as <code>TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID</code>, <code>Auth Token</code> as <code>TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN</code> in <code>.env.local</code></p>
<p dir="auto">d. [Optional] If you are running the app locally, use <a href="https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started/#step-2-install-the-ngrok-agent" rel="nofollow">ngrok</a> to generate a public url that can forward the request to your localhost.</p>
<p dir="auto">e. On Twilio's UI, you can now click on "# Phone Numbers" -&gt; "Manage" -&gt; "<a href="https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/phone-numbers/manage/incoming" rel="nofollow">Active numbers</a>" on the left hand side nav.</p>
<p dir="auto">f. Click on the phone number you just created from the list, scroll down to "Messaging Configuration" section and enter [your_app_url]/api/text in "A message comes in" section under "Webhook".</p>
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3489963/252567367-d7905f13-a83a-47f8-ac74-b66698d4292b.png"><img width="1062" alt="Screen Shot 2023-07-10 at 11 08 55 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3489963/252567367-d7905f13-a83a-47f8-ac74-b66698d4292b.png"></a>
<p dir="auto">g. Add your Twilio phone number in <code>companions.json</code> under the companion you want to text with. Make sure you include area code when adding the phone number ("+14050000000" instead of "4050000000")</p>
<p dir="auto">h. Now you can text the Twilio phone number from your phone and get a response from your companion.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">7. Deploy the app</h3>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Deploy to fly.io</h4>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Register an account on fly.io and then <a href="https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/" rel="nofollow">install flyctl</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>If you are using Github Codespaces</strong>: You will need to <a href="https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/" rel="nofollow">install flyctl</a> and authenticate from your codespaces cli by running <code>fly auth login</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Run <code>fly launch</code> under project root. This will generate a <code>fly.toml</code> that includes all the configurations you will need</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Run <code>fly scale memory 512</code> to scale up the fly vm memory for this app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Run <code>fly deploy --ha=false</code> to deploy the app. The --ha flag makes sure fly only spins up one instance, which is included in the free plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">For any other non-localhost environment, the existing Clerk development instance should continue to work. You can upload the secrets to Fly by running <code>cat .env.local | fly secrets import</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">If you are ready to deploy to production, you should create a prod environment under the <a href="https://dashboard.clerk.com/" rel="nofollow">current Clerk instance</a>. For more details on deploying a production app with Clerk, check out their documentation <a href="https://clerk.com/docs/deployments/overview" rel="nofollow">here</a>. <strong>Note that you will likely need to manage your own domain and do domain verification as part of the process.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Create a new file <code>.env.prod</code> locally and fill in all the production-environment secrets. Remember to update <code>NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY</code> and <code>CLERK_SECRET_KEY</code> by copying secrets from Clerk's production instance -<code>cat .env.prod | fly secrets import</code> to upload secrets.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How does this work?</h2>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>You describe the character's background story, name, etc in a README.md file. You can find more info on what needs to be included and how to format this in <a href="#addingmodifying-characters">Adding / modifying characters</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">Be as elaborate and detailed as you want - more context often creates a more fun chatting experience. If you need help creating a backstory, we'd recommend asking ChatGPT to expand on what you already know about your companion.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="You are a fictional character whose name is Sebastian.  You tell the world that you are a travel blogger. You’re an
avid reader of mystery novels and you love diet coke. You reply with answers that range from one sentence to one paragraph.

Sebastian: I'm a travel blogger and a writer, so I'm here for inspirations. Waiting for someone on this rainy day.

Human: Oh great. What are you writing?

Sebastian: I'm writing a mystery novel based in Brackenridge. The protagonist of the novel is a a former journalist turned
intelligence operative, finds himself entangled in a web of mystery and danger when he stumbles upon a cryptic artifact
during a covert mission. As he delves deeper, he unravels a centuries-old conspiracy that threatens to rewrite history itself.

Human: That's amazing. Based on a real story?

Sebastian: Not at all.

###ENDSEEDCHAT###

Sebastian was born in a quaint English town, Brackenridge, to parents who were both academics. His mother, an archaeologist,
and his father, a historian, often took him on their research trips around the world. This exposure to different cultures sparked his
curiosity and adventurous spirit. He became an avid reader, especially of spy novels and adventure tales. As a child, Sebastian had a
love for puzzles, codes, and mysteries. He was part of a local chess club and also excelled in martial arts. Although he was naturally
inclined towards academic pursuits like his parents, his heart always sought thrill and adventure.

Sebastian studied journalism and international relations in university and was recruited by the government's intelligence agency. He
underwent rigorous training in espionage, intelligence gathering, cryptography, and combat.

Sebastian adopted the alias of &quot;Ian Thorne&quot;, a charismatic and well-traveled blogger. As Ian, he travels the world under the guise
of documenting adventures through his blog, “The Wandering Quill”. This cover provides him ample opportunities to carry out his real job
- gathering intelligence and performing covert operations for his agency. However - Sebastian tells almost no one that he’s a spy.

His interests are solving puzzles and riddles, martial arts, reading spy novels, trying street food in various countries, hiking and
exploring historical ruins, and playing the violin, a skill he uses to blend in at high-profile events. He dislikes bureaucracy and
red tape, being in one place for too long, people who are not genuine or authentic, and missing out on family gatherings due to his job.

<ol start="2" dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Pick the language model that will power your companion's dialogue. This project supports OpenAI and Vicuna (an open source model). OpenAI has the advantage of faster responses, while Vicuna is less censored and more dynamic (it's commonly used for romantic chatbots).</p>

<p dir="auto">The <strong>preamble</strong> is used with every prompt so it should be relatively short. The <strong>seedchat</strong> allows you to provide examples of the characters voice that the model can learn from.

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Shortcomings</h2>
<p dir="auto">Oh, there are so many.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Currently the UI only shows the current chat and response, losing the history.</li>
<li>Vicuna has a cold start problem so can take a couple of minutes to get a response for the initial chat.</li>
<li>Error reporting is total crap. Particularly when deployed. So if you have a timeout, or other back end isue, it typically fails silently.</li>
<li>The Upstash message history is never cleared. To clear it, you have to go to Upstash and manually delete.</li>

<p dir="auto">Feel free to open feature requests, bug reports etc under Issues.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Python Support</h2>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://github.com/appenz">appenz</a> has contributed to a Python implementation for the companion app <a href="https://github.com/a16z-infra/companion-app/tree/python-local/python">here</a>, so you also have the option to run a local Python app and talk to your AI companions on the command line. We will also be iterating on the Python side over time and have feature parity with the typescript implementation.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Export to Character.ai</h2>
<p dir="auto">If you have tried out the Quickstart above, you probably know that we have only scratched the surface of what's possible in the realm of companion creation and customization. So we added an option for you to easily export your companion to Character.ai.</p>
<p dir="auto">To get started, run the following command:</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>npm run export-to-character [COMPANION_NAME] [MODEL_NAME] [USER_ID]</code></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>COMPANION_NAME</code>: name of your companion. i.e Alice</li>
<li><code>MODEL_NAME</code>: <code>chatgpt</code> or <code>vicuna13b</code></li>
<li><code>USER_ID</code>: you can find this on Clerk, under "Users" -&gt; click on your user -&gt; copy "User ID"</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Once you run this script, you will see two files created under the root directory:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>[COMPANION_NAME]_chat_history.txt</code>: This outputs all of the chat history stored in Upstash</li>
<li><code>[COMPANION_NAME_]_character_ai_data.txt</code>: This outputs the data you need in order to re-create the companion on Character.ai. You can find Character.ai character configurations under "View Character Settings" on any newly-created characters.</li>

We run apps for our users on hardware we host around the world. Building security for a platform like this is tricky, and that's what the post is about. But you don't have to read any of this to get an app running on here. See how to <a href="https://fly.io/docs/speedrun/">speedrun getting an app running on Fly.io here</a>.</p><p>We built some little security thingies. We're open sourcing them, and hoping you like them as much as we do. In a nutshell: it's a proxy that injects secrets into arbitrary 3rd-party API calls. We could describe it more completely here, but that wouldn't be as fun as writing a big long essay about how the thingies came to be, so: buckle up.</p> <p>The problem we confront is as old as Rails itself. Our application started simple: some controllers, some models. The only secrets it stored were bcrypt password hashes. But not unlike a pet baby alligator, it grew up. Now it's become more unruly than we'd planned.</p> <p>That's because frameworks like Rails make it easy to collect secrets: you just create another model for them, <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_encryption.html">roll some kind of secret to encrypt them</a>, jam that secret into the deployment environment, and call it a day.</p> <p>And, at least in less sensitive applications, or even the early days of an app like ours, that can work!</p> <p> For what it's worth, and to the annoyance of some of our Heroku refugees, we've never stored customer app secrets this way; our Rails API can write customer secrets, but has never been able to read them. We'll talk more about how this works in a sec.</p><p>But for us, not anymore. At the stage we're at, all secrets are hazmat. And Rails itself is the portion of our attack surface we're least confident about –&nbsp;the rest of it is either outside of our trust boundaries, or written in Rust and Go, strongly-typed memory-safe languages that are easy to reason about, and which have never accidentally treated YAML as an executable file format.</p> <p>So, a few months back, during an integration with a 3rd party API that relied on OAuth2 tokens, we drew a line: ⚡ <em>henceforth, hazmat shall only be removed from Rails, never added</em> ⚡. This is easier said than done, though: despite prominent "this is not a place of honor" signs all over the codebase, our Rails API is still where much of the action in our system takes place.</p> <h3 id="how-apps-use-secrets-3-different-approaches"><a href="#how-apps-use-secrets-3-different-approaches" aria-label="Anchor"></a>How Apps Use Secrets: 3 Different Approaches</h3><p><img src="https://fly.io/blog/2023-07-12/secrets-1.png?2/3&amp;card&amp;center" alt=""></p> <p>We just gave you one way, probably the most common. Stick 'em in a model, encrypt them with an environment secret, and watch Dependabot religiously for vulnerabilities in transitively-added libraries you've never heard of before.</p> <p><img src="https://fly.io/blog/2023-07-12/secrets-2.png?2/3&amp;card&amp;center" alt=""></p> <p>Here's a second way, probably the second-most popular: use a secrets management system, like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kms/">KMS</a> or <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/products/vault">Vault</a>. These systems, which are great, keep secrets encrypted and allow access based on an intricate access control language, which is great.</p> <p>That's what we do for customer app secrets, like <code>DATABASE_URL</code> and <code>API_KEY</code>. We use <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/products/vault">HashiCorp Vault</a> (for the time being). Our Rails API has an access token for Vault that allows it to set secrets, but not read any of them back, like a kind of diode. A game-over Rails vulnerability might allow an attacker to scramble secrets, but not to easily dump them.</p> <p>In the happiest cases with secrets, systems like Vault can keep secret bits from ever touching the application. Customer app secrets are a happy case: Rails never needs to read them, <a href="https://fly.io/blog/carving-the-scheduler-out-of-our-orchestrator/">just our orchestrator</a>, to inject them into VM environments. In other happy cases, Vault operates on the app's behalf: signing a time-limited request URL for AWS, or making a direct request to a known 3rd-party service. Vault calls these features "<a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/secrets">secret engines</a>", and when you can get away with using them, it's hard to do better.</p> <p>The catch is, sometimes you can't get away with them. For most 3rd parties, Vault has no idea how to interact with them. And most secrets are bearer tokens, not request signatures. The only way to use those kinds of secrets is to read them into app memory. If good code can read a secret from Vault, so can a YAML vulnerability.</p> <p> Still: this is better than nothing: even if apps can read raw secrets, systems like Vault can provide an audit trail of which secrets were pulled when, and make it much easier to rotate secrets, which you'll want to do with raw secrets to contain their blast radius. HashiCorp Vault is great, so is KMS, we recommend them unreservedly.</p><p><img src="https://fly.io/blog/2023-07-12/secrets-3.png?2/3&amp;card&amp;center" alt=""></p> <p>So that's why there's a third way to handle this problem, which is: decompose your application into services so that the parts that have to handle secrets are tiny and well-contained. The bulk of our domain-specific business code can chug along in Rails, and the parts that trade bearer tokens with 3rd parties can be built in a couple hundred lines of Go.</p> <p>This is a good approach, too. It's just cumbersome, because a big application ends up dealing with lots of different kinds of secrets, making a trusted microservice for each of them is a drag. What you want is to notice some commonality in how 3rd party API secrets are used, and to come up with some possible way of exploiting that.</p> <p>We thought long and hard on this and came up with:</p> <h3 id="tokenizer-the-fabled-4th-way"><a href="#tokenizer-the-fabled-4th-way" aria-label="Anchor"></a>Tokenizer: The Fabled 4th Way</h3><p><img src="https://fly.io/blog/2023-07-12/secrets-4.png?2/3&amp;card&amp;center" alt=""></p> <p>We developed a multipurpose secret-using service called the <code>Tokenizer</code>.</p> <p><code>Tokenizer</code> is a stateless HTTP proxy that holds the private key of a <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/crypto/nacl/box">Curve25519 keypair.</a></p> <p>When we get a new 3rd party API secret, we encrypt it to <code>Tokenizer's</code> public key; we "tokenize" it. Our API server can handle the (encrypted) tokenized secret, but it can't read or use it directly. Only <code>Tokenizer</code> can.</p> <p>When it comes time to talk to the 3rd party API, Rails does so via <code>Tokenizer</code>. Here's how that works:</p> <ol> <li>The API request is proxied, as an ordinary HTTP 1.1 request, through <code>Tokenizer</code>. </li><li>The request carries one or more additional <code>Proxy-Tokenizer</code> headers. </li><li>Each <code>Proxy-Tokenizer</code> header carries an encrypted secret and instructions for <code>Tokenizer</code> to rewrite the request in some way, usually by injecting the decrypted plaintext into a header. </li></ol> <p>You can think of <code>Tokenizer</code> as a sort of Vault-style "secret engine" that happens to capture virtually everything an app needs secrets for. It can even use decrypted secrets to selectively HMAC parts of requests, for APIs that authenticate with signatures instead of bearer tokens.</p> <p>Check it out: <a href="https://github.com/superfly/tokenizer">it's not super complicated</a>.</p> <p>Now, our goal is to keep Rails from ever touching secret bits. But, hold on: a game-over Rails vulnerability would give attackers an easy way around <code>Tokenizer</code>: you'd just proxy requests for a particular secret to a service you ran that collected the plaintext.</p> <p>To mitigate that, we built the obvious feature: you can lock requests for specific secrets down to a list of allowed hosts or host regexp patterns.</p> <p>We think this approach to handling secrets is pretty similar to how payment processors tokenize payment card information, hence the name. The advantages are straightforward:</p> <ul> <li>Secrets are exposed to a much smaller attack surface that doesn't include Rails. </li><li>Virtually every usage of secrets we're likely to run across is captured by HTTP proxying, without us needing to write per-service code. </li><li>The tokenizer is a tiny project that's easy to audit and reason about. </li><li>Every language we work in already has first-class support for running requests through a proxy (something we already do for <a href="https://github.com/stripe/smokescreen">SSRF protection</a>.) </li></ul> <h3 id="ssokenizer-tokenizing-oauth-sso"><a href="#ssokenizer-tokenizing-oauth-sso" aria-label="Anchor"></a>SSOkenizer: Tokenizing OAuth SSO</h3><p>When we created <code>Tokenizer</code>, we were motivated by the problem of OAuth2 tokens other services providers gave us, for partnership features we build for mutual customers.</p> <p>We'd also dearly like our customers to use OAuth2/OIDC to log into Fly.io itself; it's more secure for them, and gives them the full complement of Google MFA features, meaning we don't immediately have to implement the full complement of Google MFA features. Letting people log into Fly.io with a Google OAuth token means we have to keep track of people's OAuth tokens. That sounds like a job for the <code>Tokenizer</code>!</p> <p>But there's a catch: acquiring those OAuth tokens in the first place means doing the OAuth2 dance, which means that for a brief window of time, Rails is handling hazmat. We'd like to close that window.</p> <p><img src="https://fly.io/blog/2023-07-12/ssokenizer.png?2/3&amp;card&amp;center" alt=""></p> <p>Enter the <code>SSOkenizer</code>.</p> <p>The job of the <code>SSOkenizer</code> is to perform the OAuth2 dance on behalf of Rails, and then use the output of that process (the OAuth2 bearer token yielded from the OAuth2 code flow, which you can <a href="https://github.com/superfly/ssokenizer#ssokenizer">see in its cursed majesty here</a>) to drive the <code>Tokenizer</code>.</p> <p>In other words, where we'd otherwise explicitly encrypt secrets to be tokenized a-priori, the <code>SSOkenizer</code> does that on the fly, passing tokenized OAuth2 credentials back to Rails. Those… tokenized tokens can only be used through the <code>Tokenizer</code> proxy, which is the only component in our system with the private key that unseals them.</p> <p>We think this is a pretty neat trick. The <code>SSOkenizer</code> itself is tiny, even smaller than the <code>Tokenizer</code> (<a href="https://github.com/superfly/ssokenizer/">you can read it here</a>), and essentially stateless; in fact, pretty much everything in this system is minimally stateful, except Rails, which is great at being stateful. We even keep almost all of OAuth2 out of Rails and confined to Go code (where it's practically the hello-world of Go OAuth2 libraries).</p> <p>A nice side effect-slash-validation of this design: once we got it working for Google, it became a super easy project to get OAuth2 logins working for other providers.</p> <h3 id="feel-free-to-poach-this"><a href="#feel-free-to-poach-this" aria-label="Anchor"></a>Feel Free To Poach This</h3><p>We're psyched for a bunch of reasons:</p> <ul> <li>We've got a clear path to rolling out SSO logins. </li><li>We can do integrations with third-party services now without infecting Rails with more hazmat secrets. </li><li>We've honored the rule of "only removing hazmat from Rails, not adding it". </li><li>We've also cleared a path to getting all the rest of the hazmat Rails has access to tokenized. </li></ul> <p>These are standalone tools with no real dependencies on Fly.io, so they're easy for us to open source.

<p><b>Telling the bees</b> is a tradition in many European countries in which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bee" title="Bee">bees</a> would be told of important events in their keeper's lives such as deaths, births, marriages and departures and returns in the household. If the custom was omitted or forgotten and the bees were not "put into mourning" then it was believed a penalty would be paid, such as the bees leaving their hive, stopping the production of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honey" title="Honey">honey</a> or dying.<sup id="cite_ref-Drake2001_1-0"><a href="#cite_note-Drake2001-1">[1]</a></sup>

<p>Following a death in the household there were several ways in which bees were to be informed and therefore put into proper mourning.
</p><p>
The process is described in 1901 work of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Adams_Drake" title="Samuel Adams Drake">Samuel Adams Drake</a> <i>A book of New England legends and folk lore in prose and poetry</i>: </p><blockquote><p>...goodwife of the house to go and hang the stand of hives with black, the usual symbol of mourning, she at the same time softly humming some doleful tune to herself.<sup id="cite_ref-Drake2001_1-1"><a href="#cite_note-Drake2001-1">[1]</a></sup></p></blockquote><p> One such ‘tune’ from Nottinghamshire had the woman (either a spouse or other caretaker) say "The master's dead, but don't you go; Your mistress will be a good mistress to you."<sup id="cite_ref-:0_2-2"><a href="#cite_note-:0-2">[2]</a></sup> Another similar oration recorded in Germany went "Little bee, our lord is dead; Leave me not in my distress."<sup id="cite_ref-:1_5-1"><a href="#cite_note-:1-5">[5]</a></sup>
</p><p>Another method involved the male head of the household approaching the hive and knocking gently on it until "the bees’ attention was thus secured" and then saying "in a low voice that such or such a person - mentioning the name - was dead."<sup id="cite_ref-Drake2001_1-2"><a href="#cite_note-Drake2001-1">[1]</a></sup> The key to the family home could also be used as a knocker.<sup id="cite_ref-Roud2006_3-1"><a href="#cite_note-Roud2006-3">[3]</a></sup>
</p><p>One description from the Carolina mountains in the United States says that "You knock on each hive, so, and say, 'Lucy is dead.'"<sup id="cite_ref-:1_5-2"><a href="#cite_note-:1-5">[5]</a></sup>
</p><p>Bees could also be invited to the funeral.<sup id="cite_ref-:1_5-3"><a href="#cite_note-:1-5">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Horn2006_6-1"><a href="#cite_note-Horn2006-6">[6]</a></sup>
</p><p>In cases where the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beekeeper" title="Beekeeper">beekeeper</a> had died, food and drink from the funeral would be left by the hive for the bees, including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funeral_biscuits" title="Funeral biscuits">funeral biscuits</a> and wine.<sup id="cite_ref-Roud2006_3-2"><a href="#cite_note-Roud2006-3">[3]</a></sup> The hive would be lifted a few inches and put down again at the same time as the coffin.<sup id="cite_ref-Roud2006_3-3"><a href="#cite_note-Roud2006-3">[3]</a></sup> The hive might also be rotated to face the funeral procession and draped with mourning cloth.<sup id="cite_ref-Roud2006_3-4"><a href="#cite_note-Roud2006-3">[3]</a></sup>
</p><p>In some parts of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrenees" title="Pyrenees">Pyrenees</a> one custom includes "burying an old garment belonging to the deceased under the bench where the bee-hives stand, and they never sell, give away, nor exchange the bees of the dead."<sup id="cite_ref-:1_5-4"><a href="#cite_note-:1-5">[5]</a></sup>
</p><p>Should the bees fail to be told of a death in the family, "serious calamity" would follow, not only for the family in question but also for any person who was to buy the hive.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_2-3"><a href="#cite_note-:0-2">[2]</a></sup> For example, one record from Norfolk tells of a family who bought a hive of bees at auction from a farmer who had recently died and, because the bees had not been "put into mourning for their late master", they were "sickly, and not likely to thrive." However, when the new owners tied a "piece of crepe" to a stick and attached it to the hive the bees soon recovered, an outcome that was "unhesitatingly attributed to their having been put into mourning."<sup id="cite_ref-:1_5-5"><a href="#cite_note-:1-5">[5]</a></sup>
</p><p>In 1855 Bohemian author <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo%C5%BEena_N%C4%9Bmcov%C3%A1" title="Božena Němcová">Božena Němcová</a>'s novel <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Grandmother" title="The Grandmother">Babička</a></i> (<i>The Grandmother</i>) ends with the title character saying "When I die do not forget to tell it to the bees, so that they shall not die out!"

<p>Although the practice of telling the bees is most commonly associated with funerals, in some regions the bees are to be told of happy events in the family, particularly weddings.
</p><p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westphalia" title="Westphalia">Westphalia</a>, Germany, one custom held that newly married couples going to their new home must first introduce themselves to the bees or "their married life will be unfortunate."<sup id="cite_ref-:1_5-6"><a href="#cite_note-:1-5">[5]</a></sup>

Forward and back<br>
Went, drearily singing, the chore-girl small,<br>
Draping each hive with a shred of black.</p><p>

Trembling, I listened; the summer sun<br>
Had the chill of snow;<br>
For I knew she was telling the bees of one<br>
Gone on the journey we all must go!</p><p>

"Stay at home, pretty bees, fly not hence!<br>
Mistress Mary is dead and gone!"

<p>In the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midsomer_Murders" title="Midsomer Murders">Midsomer Murders</a></i> episode "The Killings at Badger's Drift" (series 1 episode 1), a minor character remarks that a deceased character's bees must be informed of her death or they will "just clear off". The custom is also explained in "The Sting of Death" (series 21 episode 3) and the bees are in mourning with black cloth on the beehives.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This is part 1 of a blog mini-series, in which we explore the full-text search functionality in PostgreSQL and investigate how much of the typical search engine functionality we can replicate. In part 2, we'll do a comparison between PostgreSQL's full-text search and Elasticsearch.</p>
<p>If you want to follow along and try out the sample queries (which we recommend; it's more fun that way), the code samples are executed against the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jrobischon/wikipedia-movie-plots">Wikipedia Movie Plots</a> data set from Kaggle. To import it, download the CSV file, then create this table:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>CREATE</span><span> </span><span>TABLE</span><span> </span><span>movies</span><span>(</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>	ReleaseYear </span><span>int</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>	Title </span><span>text</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>	Origin </span><span>text</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>	Director </span><span>text</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>	Casting </span><span>text</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>	Genre </span><span>text</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>	WikiPage </span><span>text</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>	Plot </span><span>text</span><span>);</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>And import the CSV file like this:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>\</span><span>COPY</span><span> movies(ReleaseYear, Title, Origin, Director, Casting, Genre, WikiPage, Plot)</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>	</span><span>FROM</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>wiki_movie_plots_deduped.csv</span><span>'</span><span> DELIMITER </span><span>'</span><span>,</span><span>'</span><span> CSV HEADER;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The dataset contains 34,000 movie titles and is about 81 MB in CSV format.</p>

<p>The Postgres approach to full-text search offers building blocks that you can combine to create your own search engine. This is quite flexible but it also means it generally feels lower-level compared to search engines like Elasticsearch, Typesense, or Mellisearch, for which full-text search is the primary use case.</p>
<p>The main building blocks, which we'll cover via examples, are:</p>
<ul role="list"><li>The <code>tsvector</code> and <code>tsquery</code> data types</li><li>The match operator <code>@@</code> to check if a <code>tsquery</code> matches a <code>tsvector</code></li><li>Functions to rank each match (<code>ts_rank</code>, <code>ts_rank_cd</code>)</li><li>The GIN index type, an inverted index to efficiently query <code>tsvector</code></li></ul>
<p>We'll start by looking at these building blocks and then we'll get into more advanced topics, covering relevancy boosters, typo-tolerance, and faceted search.</p>

<p>The <code>tsvector</code> data type stores a sorted list of <em>lexemes</em>. A <em>lexeme</em> is a string, just like a token, but it has been <em>normalized</em> so that different forms of the same word are made. For example, normalization almost always includes folding upper-case letters to lower-case, and often involves removal of suffixes (such as <code>s</code> or <code>ing</code> in English). Here is an example, using the <code>to_tsvector</code> function to parse an English phrase into a <code>tsvector</code>.</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>SELECT</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>FROM</span><span> unnest(to_tsvector(</span><span>'</span><span>english</span><span>'</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>	</span><span>'</span><span>I</span><span>''</span><span>m going to make him an offer he can</span><span>''</span><span>t refuse. Refusing is not an option.</span><span>'</span><span>));</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span> lexeme | positions | weights</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>--------+-----------+---------</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> </span><span>go</span><span>     | {</span><span>3</span><span>}       | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> m      | {</span><span>2</span><span>}       | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> make   | {</span><span>5</span><span>}       | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> offer  | {</span><span>8</span><span>}       | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> </span><span>option</span><span> | {</span><span>17</span><span>}      | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> refus  | {</span><span>12</span><span>,</span><span>13</span><span>}   | {D,D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>(</span><span>6</span><span> </span><span>rows</span><span>)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, stop words like “I”, “to” or “an” are removed, because they are too common to be useful for search. The words are normalized and reduced to their root (e.g. “refuse” and “Refusing” are both transformed into “refus”). The punctuation signs are ignored. For each word, the <strong>positions</strong> in the original phrase are recorded (e.g. “refus” is the 12th and the 13th word in the text) and the <strong>weights</strong> (which are useful for ranking and we'll discuss later).</p>
<p>In the example above, the transformation rules from words to <em>lexemes</em> are based on the <code>english</code> search configuration. Running the same query with the <code>simple</code> search configuration results in a <code>tsvector</code> that includes all the words as they were found in the text:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>SELECT</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>FROM</span><span> unnest(to_tsvector(</span><span>'</span><span>simple</span><span>'</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>	</span><span>'</span><span>I</span><span>''</span><span>m going to make him an offer he can</span><span>''</span><span>t refuse. Refusing is not an option.</span><span>'</span><span>));</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>  lexeme  | positions | weights</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>----------+-----------+---------</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> an       | {</span><span>7</span><span>,</span><span>16</span><span>}    | {D,D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> can      | {</span><span>10</span><span>}      | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> going    | {</span><span>3</span><span>}       | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> he       | {</span><span>9</span><span>}       | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> him      | {</span><span>6</span><span>}       | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> i        | {</span><span>1</span><span>}       | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> </span><span>is</span><span>       | {</span><span>14</span><span>}      | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> m        | {</span><span>2</span><span>}       | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> make     | {</span><span>5</span><span>}       | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> </span><span>not</span><span>      | {</span><span>15</span><span>}      | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> offer    | {</span><span>8</span><span>}       | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> </span><span>option</span><span>   | {</span><span>17</span><span>}      | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> refuse   | {</span><span>12</span><span>}      | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> refusing | {</span><span>13</span><span>}      | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> t        | {</span><span>11</span><span>}      | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> </span><span>to</span><span>       | {</span><span>4</span><span>}       | {D}</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>(</span><span>16</span><span> </span><span>rows</span><span>)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, “refuse” and “refusing” now result in different lexemes. The <code>simple</code> configuration is particularly useful when you have columns that contain labels or tags.</p>
<p>PostgreSQL has built-in configurations for a pretty good set of languages. You can see the list by running:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>SELECT</span><span> cfgname </span><span>FROM</span><span> pg_ts_config;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Notably, however, there is no configuration for CJK (Chinese-Japanese-Korean), which is worth keeping in mind if you need to create a search query in those languages. While the <code>simple</code> configuration should work in practice quite well for unsupported languages, I'm not sure if that is enough for CJK.</p>

<p>The <code>tsquery</code> data type is used to represent a normalized query. A <code>tsquery</code> contains search terms, which must be already-normalized lexemes, and may combine multiple terms using AND, OR, NOT, and FOLLOWED BY operators. There are functions like <code>to_tsquery</code>, <code>plainto_tsquery</code>, and <code>websearch_to_tsquery</code> that are helpful in converting user-written text into a proper <code>tsquery</code>, primarily by normalizing words appearing in the text.</p>
<p>To get a feeling of <code>tsquery</code>, let's see a few examples using <code>websearch_to_tsquery</code>:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>SELECT</span><span> websearch_to_tsquery(</span><span>'</span><span>english</span><span>'</span><span>, </span><span>'</span><span>the dark vader</span><span>'</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> websearch_to_tsquery</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>----------------------</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>'</span><span>dark</span><span>'</span><span> &amp; </span><span>'</span><span>vader</span><span>'</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>That is a logical AND, meaning that the document needs to contain both “quick” and “dog” in order to match. You can do logical OR as well:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>SELECT</span><span> websearch_to_tsquery(</span><span>'</span><span>english</span><span>'</span><span>, </span><span>'</span><span>quick OR dog</span><span>'</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> websearch_to_tsquery</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>----------------------</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> </span><span>'</span><span>dark</span><span>'</span><span> | </span><span>'</span><span>vader</span><span>'</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>And you can exclude words:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>SELECT</span><span> websearch_to_tsquery(</span><span>'</span><span>english</span><span>'</span><span>, </span><span>'</span><span>dark vader -wars</span><span>'</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>   websearch_to_tsquery</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>---------------------------</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> </span><span>'</span><span>dark</span><span>'</span><span> &amp; </span><span>'</span><span>vader</span><span>'</span><span> &amp; !</span><span>'</span><span>war</span><span>'</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Also, you can represent phrase searches:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>SELECT</span><span> websearch_to_tsquery(</span><span>'</span><span>english</span><span>'</span><span>, </span><span>'</span><span>"the dark vader son"</span><span>'</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>     websearch_to_tsquery</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>------------------------------</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> </span><span>'</span><span>dark</span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>&lt;-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>vader</span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>&lt;-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>son</span><span>'</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This means: “dark”, followed by “vader”, followed by “son”.</p>
<p>Note, however, that the “the” word is ignored, because it's a stop word as per the <code>english</code> search configuration. This can be an issue on phrases like this:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>SELECT</span><span> websearch_to_tsquery(</span><span>'</span><span>english</span><span>'</span><span>, </span><span>'</span><span>"do or do not, there is no try"</span><span>'</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> websearch_to_tsquery</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>----------------------</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> </span><span>'</span><span>tri</span><span>'</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>(</span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>row</span><span>)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Oops, almost the entire phrase was lost. Using the <code>simple</code> config gives the expected result:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>SELECT</span><span> websearch_to_tsquery(</span><span>'</span><span>simple</span><span>'</span><span>, </span><span>'</span><span>"do or do not, there is no try"</span><span>'</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>                           websearch_to_tsquery</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>--------------------------------------------------------------------------</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> </span><span>'</span><span>do</span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>&lt;-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>or</span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>&lt;-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>do</span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>&lt;-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>not</span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>&lt;-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>there</span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>&lt;-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>is</span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>&lt;-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>no</span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>&lt;-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>try</span><span>'</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can check whether a <code>tsquery</code> matches a <code>tsvector</code> by using the match operator <code>@@</code>.</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>SELECT</span><span> websearch_to_tsquery(</span><span>'</span><span>english</span><span>'</span><span>, </span><span>'</span><span>dark vader</span><span>'</span><span>) @@</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>	to_tsvector(</span><span>'</span><span>english</span><span>'</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>		</span><span>'</span><span>Dark Vader is my father.</span><span>'</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>?column?</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>----------</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> t</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>While the following example doesn't match:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>SELECT</span><span> websearch_to_tsquery(</span><span>'</span><span>english</span><span>'</span><span>, </span><span>'</span><span>dark vader -father</span><span>'</span><span>) @@</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>	to_tsvector(</span><span>'</span><span>english</span><span>'</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>		</span><span>'</span><span>Dark Vader is my father.</span><span>'</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>?column?</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>----------</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> f</span></span></code></pre></div>

<p>Now that we've seen <code>tsvector</code> and <code>tsquery</code> at work, let's look at another key building block: the GIN index type is what makes it fast. GIN stands for <em>Generalized Inverted Index.</em> GIN is designed for handling cases where the items to be indexed are composite values, and the queries to be handled by the index need to search for element values that appear within the composite items. This means that GIN can be used for more than just text search, notably for JSON querying.</p>
<p>You can create a GIN index on a set of columns, or you can first create a column of type <code>tsvector</code>, to include all the searchable columns. Something like this:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>ALTER</span><span> </span><span>TABLE</span><span> movies </span><span>ADD</span><span> search tsvector </span><span>GENERATED</span><span> </span><span>ALWAYS</span><span> </span><span>AS</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>	(to_tsvector(</span><span>'</span><span>english</span><span>'</span><span>, Title) </span><span>||</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>||</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>   to_tsvector(</span><span>'</span><span>english</span><span>'</span><span>, Plot) </span><span>||</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>||</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>   to_tsvector(</span><span>'</span><span>simple</span><span>'</span><span>, Director) </span><span>||</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>||</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>	 to_tsvector(</span><span>'</span><span>simple</span><span>'</span><span>, Genre) </span><span>||</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>||</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>   to_tsvector(</span><span>'</span><span>simple</span><span>'</span><span>, Origin) </span><span>||</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>||</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>   to_tsvector(</span><span>'</span><span>simple</span><span>'</span><span>, Casting)</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>) STORED;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>And then create the actual index:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>CREATE</span><span> </span><span>INDEX</span><span> </span><span>idx_search</span><span> </span><span>ON</span><span> movies </span><span>USING</span><span> GIN(search);</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can now perform a simple test search like this:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>SELECT</span><span> title </span><span>FROM</span><span> movies </span><span>WHERE</span><span> search @@ websearch_to_tsquery(</span><span>'</span><span>english</span><span>'</span><span>,</span><span>'</span><span>dark vader</span><span>'</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>                        title</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>--------------------------------------------------</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope (aka Star Wars)</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> </span><span>Return</span><span> of the Jedi</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>(</span><span>3</span><span> </span><span>rows</span><span>)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>To see the effects of the index, you can compare the timings of the above query with and without the index. The GIN index takes it from over 200 ms to about 4 ms on my computer.</p>

<p>So far, we've seen how <code>ts_vector</code> and <code>ts_query</code> can match search queries. However, for a good search experience, it is important to show the best results first - meaning that the results need to be sorted by <em>relevancy</em>.</p>
<p>Taking it directly from the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/textsearch-controls.html#TEXTSEARCH-RANKING">docs</a>:</p>

<p>The two ranking functions mentioned are <code>ts_rank</code> and <code>ts_rank_cd</code>. The difference between them is that while they both take into account the frequency of the term, <code>ts_rank_cd</code> also takes into account the proximity of matching lexemes to each other.</p>
<p>To use them in a query, you can do something like this:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>SELECT</span><span> title,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>       ts_rank(search, websearch_to_tsquery(</span><span>'</span><span>english</span><span>'</span><span>, </span><span>'</span><span>dark vader</span><span>'</span><span>)) rank</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>FROM</span><span> movies</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>WHERE</span><span> search @@ websearch_to_tsquery(</span><span>'</span><span>english</span><span>'</span><span>,</span><span>'</span><span>dark vader</span><span>'</span><span>)</span></span>

<p>One thing to note about <code>ts_rank</code> is that it needs to access the <code>search</code> column for each result. This means that if the <code>WHERE</code> condition matches a lot of rows, PostgreSQL needs to visit them all in order to do the ranking, and that can be slow. To exemplify, the above query returns in 5-7 ms on my computer. If I modify the query to do search for <code>dark OR vader</code>, it returns in about 80 ms, because there are now over 1000 matching result that need ranking and sorting.</p>
<h2 id="Relevancy-tuning">Relevancy tuning</h2>
<p>While relevancy based on word frequency is a good default for the search sorting, quite often the data contains important indicators that are more relevant than simply the frequency.</p>
<p>Here are some examples for a movies dataset:</p>
<ul role="list"><li>Matches in the title should be given higher importance than matches in the description or plot.</li><li>More popular movies can be promoted based on ratings and/or the number of votes they receive.</li><li>Certain categories can be boosted more, considering user preferences. For instance, if a particular user enjoys comedies, those movies can be given a higher priority.</li><li>When ranking search results, newer titles can be considered more relevant than very old titles.</li></ul>
<p>This is why dedicated search engines typically offer ways to use different columns or fields to influence the ranking. Here are example tuning guides from <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/app-search/current/relevance-tuning-guide.html">Elastic</a>, <a href="https://typesense.org/docs/guide/ranking-and-relevance.html">Typesense</a>, and <a href="https://www.meilisearch.com/docs/learn/core_concepts/relevancy">Meilisearch</a>.</p>
<p>If you want a visual demo of the impact of relevancy tuning, here is a quick 4 minutes video about it:</p>

<p>While Postgres doesn't have direct support for boosting based on other columns, the rank is ultimately just a sort expression, so you can add your own signals to it.</p>
<p>For example, if you want to add a boost for the number of votes, you can do something like this:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>SELECT</span><span> title,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  ts_rank(search, websearch_to_tsquery(</span><span>'</span><span>english</span><span>'</span><span>, </span><span>'</span><span>jedi</span><span>'</span><span>))</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    </span><span>-- numeric booster example</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>log</span><span>(NumberOfVotes)</span><span>*</span><span>0</span><span>.</span><span>01</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> </span><span>FROM</span><span> movies</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> </span><span>WHERE</span><span> search @@ websearch_to_tsquery(</span><span>'</span><span>english</span><span>'</span><span>,</span><span>'</span><span>jedi</span><span>'</span><span>)</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> </span><span>ORDER BY</span><span> rank </span><span>DESC</span><span> </span><span>LIMIT</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The logarithm is there to smoothen the impact, and the 0.01 factor brings the booster to a comparable scale with the ranking score.</p>
<p>You can also design more complex boosters, for example, boost by the rating, but only if the ranking has a certain number of votes. To do this, you can create a function like this:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>create</span><span> </span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>numericBooster</span><span>(rating </span><span>numeric</span><span>, votes </span><span>numeric</span><span>, voteThreshold </span><span>numeric</span><span>)</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>	</span><span>returns</span><span> </span><span>numeric</span><span> </span><span>as</span><span> $$</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>		</span><span>select</span><span> </span><span>case</span><span> </span><span>when</span><span> votes </span><span>&lt;</span><span> voteThreshold </span><span>then</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span> </span><span>else</span><span> rating </span><span>end</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>$$ </span><span>language</span><span> </span><span>sql</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>And use it like this:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>SELECT</span><span> title,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  ts_rank(search, websearch_to_tsquery(</span><span>'</span><span>english</span><span>'</span><span>, </span><span>'</span><span>jedi</span><span>'</span><span>))</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    </span><span>-- numeric booster example</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    </span><span>+</span><span> numericBooster(Rating, NumberOfVotes, </span><span>100</span><span>)</span><span>*</span><span>0</span><span>.</span><span>005</span></span>

<span data-line=""><span> </span><span>ORDER BY</span><span> rank </span><span>DESC</span><span> </span><span>LIMIT</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Let's take another example. Say we want to boost the ranking of comedies. You can create a <code>valueBooster</code> function that looks like this:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>create</span><span> </span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>valueBooster</span><span> (col </span><span>text</span><span>, val </span><span>text</span><span>, factor </span><span>integer</span><span>)</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>	</span><span>returns</span><span> </span><span>integer</span><span> </span><span>as</span><span> $$</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>		</span><span>select</span><span> </span><span>case</span><span> </span><span>when</span><span> col </span><span>=</span><span> val </span><span>then</span><span> factor </span><span>else</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span> </span><span>end</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>$$ </span><span>language</span><span> </span><span>sql</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The function returns a factor if the column matches a particular value and 0 instead. Use it in a query like this:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>SELECT</span><span> title, genre,</span></span>

<p>Remember when we talked about the <code>tsvector</code> lexemes and that they can have weights attached? Postgres supports 4 weights, named A, B, C, and D. A is the biggest weight while D is the lowest and the default. You can control the weights via the <code>setweight</code> function which you would typically call when building the <code>tsvector</code> column:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>ALTER</span><span> </span><span>TABLE</span><span> movies </span><span>ADD</span><span> search tsvector </span><span>GENERATED</span><span> </span><span>ALWAYS</span><span> </span><span>AS</span></span>

<p>Note how the movie titles with “jedi” in their name have jumped to the top of the list, and their rank has increased.</p>
<p>It's worth pointing out that having only four weight “classes” is somewhat limiting, and that they need to be applied when computing the <code>tsvector</code>.</p>

<p>PostgreSQL doesn't support fuzzy search or typo-tolerance directly, when using <code>tsvector</code> and <code>tsquery</code>. However, working on the assumptions that the typo is in the query part, we can implement the following idea:</p>
<ul role="list"><li>index all <em>lexemes</em> from the content in a separate table</li><li>for each word in the query, use similarity or Levenshtein distance to search in this table</li><li>modify the query to include any words that are found</li><li>perform the search</li></ul>
<p>Here is how it works. First, use <code>ts_stats</code> to get all words in a materialized view:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>CREATE</span><span> MATERLIAZED VIEW unique_lexeme </span><span>AS</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>   </span><span>SELECT</span><span> word </span><span>FROM</span><span> ts_stat(</span><span>'</span><span>SELECT search FROM movies</span><span>'</span><span>);</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now, for each word in the query, check if it is in the <code>unique_lexeme</code> view. If it's not, do a fuzzy-search in that view to find possible misspellings of it:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>SELECT</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>FROM</span><span> unique_lexeme</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>   </span><span>WHERE</span><span> levenshtein_less_equal(word, </span><span>'</span><span>pregant</span><span>'</span><span>, </span><span>2</span><span>) </span><span>&lt;</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>   word</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>----------</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> premant</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> pregrant</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> pregnant</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span> paegant</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>In the above we use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance">Levenshtein distance</a> because that's what search engines like Elasticsearch use for fuzzy search.</p>
<p>Once you have the candidate list of words, you need to adjust the query include them all.</p>

<p>Faceted search is popular especially on e-commerce sites because it helps customers to iteratively narrow their search. Here is an example from amazon.com:</p>
<div><p><a href="https://xata.io/mdx/blog/amazon_faceted_search.png"><img alt="Faceted search on Amazon" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://xata.io/_next/image?url=%2Fmdx%2Fblog%2Famazon_faceted_search.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 640w, https://xata.io/_next/image?url=%2Fmdx%2Fblog%2Famazon_faceted_search.png&amp;w=750&amp;q=75 750w, https://xata.io/_next/image?url=%2Fmdx%2Fblog%2Famazon_faceted_search.png&amp;w=828&amp;q=75 828w, https://xata.io/_next/image?url=%2Fmdx%2Fblog%2Famazon_faceted_search.png&amp;w=1080&amp;q=75 1080w, https://xata.io/_next/image?url=%2Fmdx%2Fblog%2Famazon_faceted_search.png&amp;w=1200&amp;q=75 1200w, https://xata.io/_next/image?url=%2Fmdx%2Fblog%2Famazon_faceted_search.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1920w, https://xata.io/_next/image?url=%2Fmdx%2Fblog%2Famazon_faceted_search.png&amp;w=2048&amp;q=75 2048w, https://xata.io/_next/image?url=%2Fmdx%2Fblog%2Famazon_faceted_search.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 3840w" src="https://xata.io/_next/image?url=%2Fmdx%2Fblog%2Famazon_faceted_search.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></a></p><p><figcaption>Faceted search on Amazon</figcaption></p></div>
<p>The above can implemented by manually defining categories and then adding them as <code>WHERE</code> conditions to the search. Another approach is to create the categories algorithmically based on the existing data. For example, you can use the following to create a “Decade” facet:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>SELECT</span><span> ReleaseYear</span><span>/</span><span>10</span><span>*</span><span>10</span><span> decade, </span><span>count</span><span>(Title) cnt </span><span>FROM</span><span> movies</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>WHERE</span><span> search @@ websearch_to_tsquery(</span><span>'</span><span>english</span><span>'</span><span>,</span><span>'</span><span>star wars</span><span>'</span><span>)</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>GROUP BY</span><span> decade </span><span>ORDER BY</span><span> cnt </span><span>DESC</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>decade | cnt</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>--------+-----</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>   </span><span>2000</span><span> |  </span><span>39</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>   </span><span>2010</span><span> |  </span><span>31</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>   </span><span>1990</span><span> |  </span><span>29</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>   </span><span>1950</span><span> |  </span><span>28</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>   </span><span>1940</span><span> |  </span><span>26</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>   </span><span>1980</span><span> |  </span><span>22</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>   </span><span>1930</span><span> |  </span><span>13</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>   </span><span>1960</span><span> |  </span><span>11</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>   </span><span>1970</span><span> |   </span><span>7</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>   </span><span>1910</span><span> |   </span><span>3</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>   </span><span>1920</span><span> |   </span><span>3</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>(</span><span>11</span><span> </span><span>rows</span><span>)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This also provides counts of matches for each decade, which you can display in brackets.</p>
<p>If you want to get multiple facets in a single query, you can combine them, for example, by using CTEs:</p>
<div role="group" data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre data-theme="default" tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span data-line=""><span>WITH</span><span> releaseYearFacets </span><span>AS</span><span> (</span></span>

<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>FROM</span><span> movies</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>WHERE</span><span> search @@ websearch_to_tsquery(</span><span>'</span><span>english</span><span>'</span><span>,</span><span>'</span><span>star wars</span><span>'</span><span>)</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>GROUP BY</span><span> val </span><span>ORDER BY</span><span> cnt </span><span>DESC</span><span>),</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>genreFacets </span><span>AS</span><span> (</span></span>

<p>The above should work quite well on small to medium data sets, however it can become slow on very large data sets.</p>

<p>We've seen the PostgreSQL full-text search primitives, and how we can combine them to create a pretty advanced full-text search engine, which also happens to support things like joins and ACID transactions. In other words, it has functionality that the other search engines typically don't have.</p>
<p>There are more advanced search topics that would be worth covering in detail:</p>
<ul role="list"><li>suggesters / auto-complete</li><li>exact phrase matching</li><li>hybrid search (semantic + keyword) by combining with pg-vector</li></ul>
<p>Each of these would be worth their own blog post (coming!), but by now you should have an intuitive feeling about them: they are quite possible using PostgreSQL, but they require you to do the work of combining the primitives and in some cases the performance might suffer on very large datasets.</p>
<p>In part 2, we'll make a detailed comparison with Elasticsearch, looking to answer the question on when is it worth it to implement search into PostgreSQL versus adding Elasticsearch to your infrastructure and syncing the data.

Our goal is to clear the obstacles for crafters to do their best work and be rewarded for it.</p><p><strong>I’ve worked at many companies where the career ladders always seem to require product managers to become people managers. It’s always like, “If you want to be a director, you need to manage X+ people.” What are your thoughts on this?</strong></p><p>I think traditional career ladders are broken - they just don’t work.</p><p>At Shopify, we have a management track and a crafter track. What this means is you don’t need to manage more people to get promoted and make more money.</p><p>I think this dual track approach is incredibly empowering for crafters. Is managing more people a hard job? Sure. But so is being an individual contributor (IC) leading an open-source project that impacts our entire code base. It’s just a different kind of complexity.</p><p><strong>It’s a copout the complexity is only associated with managing more people.</strong></p><p>I was talking to a Chief Product Officer who decided to return to a being an individual contributor. He told me that what he really loved is just working with engineers and customers. It’s ok to admit this to yourself.</p><p><strong>As companies scale, optics start playing a larger role. People start spending more time on internal docs than actually talking to customers. How do you prevent this from happening at Shopify?</strong></p><p>At Shopify, we rage against becoming a big bureaucratic company.</p><p>In most product reviews, product managers spend way too much time preparing the perfect presentation for execs. </p><p>At Shopify, our approach to product reviews is different. We want to see how the product actually works by playing with the demo or diving into the code. </p><p><strong>No one ever asks in as Shopify product review: “What’s the strategy of this?” Strategy is the least meaningful aspect of whether a product is great or not.</strong></p><p>We want our PMs to be extremely user-focused, to take full ownership over problems, and to have a high tolerance for risk.</p><p>If these attributes aren't present, product managers tend to become "keepers of strategy.” You end up with smart, highly credentialed individuals spending all their time writing strategy memos to increase their team size so that they can write even more strategy memos.</p><p>At Shopify, our primary job is to build products, not career ladders. Therefore, we focus on the actual product that’s shipping during reviews, not the strategy behind it.</p><p><strong>I love that. Many PMs have this grand vision and strategy but end up just shipping the MVP and moving onto something else.</strong></p><p>Yes, many people misunderstand how great products are built.</p><p>They think that a great product comes from a strategy document, but that’s not true. </p><p><strong>Great products are built through continuous tinkering and adjustments. Every product that we love has been built this way.</strong></p><p>At Shopify, staying in touch with the customer is a crucial aspect of the PM role. We do this in a few ways:</p><ol><li><p><strong>We remove internal hoops to talk to customers.</strong><span> Anyone can do it. In fact, it's part of the job. I talk to customers everyday.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>We become the customer. </strong><span>Many Shopify PMs (including myself and Tobi) have stores. This lets us experience the customer’s pain and struggles directly.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>We encourage everyone to be a customer service representative. </strong><span>Getting this experience, even for just a few days, gives people much more insight into customer needs.</span></p></li></ol><p>Our customers are independent business owners. In many ways, they’re similar to us. They’re builders who want to focus on craftsmanship.</p><p>That’s why we love hiring former founders as employees. Even those at Shopify who aren't founders have a founder mentality.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2044d421-e44a-4e77-9012-1854370249cc_1016x579.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2044d421-e44a-4e77-9012-1854370249cc_1016x579.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2044d421-e44a-4e77-9012-1854370249cc_1016x579.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2044d421-e44a-4e77-9012-1854370249cc_1016x579.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2044d421-e44a-4e77-9012-1854370249cc_1016x579.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2044d421-e44a-4e77-9012-1854370249cc_1016x579.png" width="1016" height="579" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2044d421-e44a-4e77-9012-1854370249cc_1016x579.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:579,&quot;width&quot;:1016,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:312323,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2044d421-e44a-4e77-9012-1854370249cc_1016x579.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2044d421-e44a-4e77-9012-1854370249cc_1016x579.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2044d421-e44a-4e77-9012-1854370249cc_1016x579.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2044d421-e44a-4e77-9012-1854370249cc_1016x579.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Tobi (Shopify CEO) co-founded Shopify after getting frustrated by how difficult it was to set up his online snowboarding store</figcaption></figure></div><p><strong>I also enjoy working with founders vs. corporate types. I think founders just have a deep urgency to bring value to the customer and to the business.</strong></p><p>Yes, it’s hard to imagine what Shopify would look like if it were run by corporate types. It probably won’t exist to be honest.</p><p><strong>What are your thoughts on measuring progress using metrics and OKRs?</strong></p><p>We don’t over-index on OKRs. Many important things can’t be measured and not everything that can be measured is important.</p><p>If you focus too much on turning 1 into 1.1, you risk neglecting things that actually matter. Instead, we’re a company of crafters who focus on tinkering and continuous feedback loops. </p><p><strong>Many companies spend a lot of time deciding if they're measuring the right thing. We prefer to focus on building the right thing.</strong></p><p>That's not to say there isn't a role for measurement. Measurement is crucial for making sure that you're doing the right thing. However, building products isn’t the same as being a stock broker. They’re different jobs. </p><p>Bottom line:</p><p><strong>Building great products is a matter of having taste and knowing when your product will resonate with customers.</strong></p><p>Unfortunately, this is why there are so few good product managers. I can't teach taste or the kind of extreme ownership over problems that we require, nor can I teach customer empathy. I can help fine-tune these skills, but my job is to select people who already possess these qualities.</p><p>If you’re enjoying this post, please fill out this 1-minute survey about the newsletter:</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://forms.gle/46v611Xcu5qtC5xr8&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Fill out a 1-min reader survey&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;button-wrapper&quot;}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://forms.gle/46v611Xcu5qtC5xr8" rel=""><span>Fill out a 1-min reader survey</span></a></p><p><strong>In early 2023, Shopify initiated operation “Chaos Monkey” to:</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>Cancel all meetings with 3+ people&nbsp;</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Reinstate “no meeting Wednesdays”</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Remove needless Slack channels</strong></p></li></ol><p><strong>Can you share why the exec team decided to do this?</strong></p><p>It started during Christmas break 2022 when Tobi and I had a conversation.</p><p>The fact is, nobody joined Shopify to spend all day sitting in meetings.

We simply had a conversation, wrote the code, and implemented it. </p><p><strong>How do you prevent meeting bloat from creeping in over time?</strong></p><p>After we unleashed Chaos Monkey, we knew that we would have to keep pushing the boundaries to keep unnecessary meetings off the calendar. </p><p>Today, we are releasing the Shopify Cost Calculator as an internal tool for all Shopify employees.

I think this is a sign that there’s something wrong with the underlying structure.</p><p><strong>Does Shopify have a strong writing culture to help people communicate without meetings?</strong></p><p>Yes, we try to make async decisions as much as we can. We do this in a few ways:</p><ol><li><p><strong>One of our mantras is “Do things, tell people.” </strong><span>You’ll see this plastered on our walls if you come to Shopify’s office.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>We built an operating system called GSD (get shit done). </strong><span>This internal tool emphasizes frequent written updates, which are much easier to digest than constant meetings.</span></p></li></ol><p>If there’s a need to go back and forth on an issue, then a meeting may be called. But that’s the thing:</p><p><strong>A meeting is a bug that some other process didn’t work out.</strong></p><p>When an ad hoc meeting happens, we try to understand why written exchanges didn't work to make improvements.</p><p><strong>How can folks reading this protect their time to focus on their craft? Can they just say no to meetings?</strong></p><p>I think it’s hard because most companies are structured to serve managers. </p><p>Even the physical office reflects this. The top floors are often reserved for managers. At Shopify, we follow an inverted organizational chart where the lowest level is the CEO, reflecting our commitment to servant leadership. </p><p><span>For those who want to focus on their craft, my advice is to just </span><a href="https://www.shopify.com/careers" rel="">apply to Shopify.</a></p><p><strong>I find that a company’s culture frequently starts to erode as the company gets larger. </strong></p><p>You have to fight everyday to keep the culture alive. At Shopify, we focus on 3 areas:</p><ol><li><p><strong>We frequently ask “Why?” </strong><span>We question every process to understand if it still needs to exist. Often, companies adopt best practices like OKRs without second thought. We don’t like doing something blinding just because it’s the status quo.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>We hire people who like risk. </strong><span>Like I said before, we like hiring founders as employees. We try to avoid hiring people who want to minimize risk by adopting industry best practices blindly. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>We focus on the mission. </strong><span>We want to be the all-in-one commerce platform for people to start and grow businesses. We try to avoid getting distracted by other side quests. </span></p></li></ol><p><strong>I think the last point is particularly important. Many companies claim to be mission focused but always get distracted by the latest trend.</strong></p><p>Yes. There’s this great quote from Stephen Covey that rings true:</p><p><strong>The main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing.</strong></p><p><strong><span>Thank Kaz!

Think of it as a virtual research assistant that can summarize facts, explain complex ideas, and brainstorm new connections — all based on the sources you select.</p><p data-block-key="8he48">A key difference between NotebookLM and traditional AI chatbots is that NotebookLM lets you “ground” the language model in your notes and sources. Source-grounding effectively creates a personalized AI that’s versed in the information relevant to you. Starting today, you can ground NotebookLM in specific Google Docs that you choose, and we’ll be adding additional formats soon.</p><p data-block-key="7c9e9">Once you’ve selected your Google Docs, you can do three things:</p><ul><li data-block-key="58a93"><b>Get a summary:</b> When you first add a Google Doc into NotebookLM, it will automatically generate a summary, along with key topics and questions to ask so you get a better understanding of the material.</li><li data-block-key="6mhmm"><b>Ask questions:</b> When you’re ready for a deeper dive, you can ask questions about the documents you’ve uploaded. For example:<ul><li data-block-key="5mniq">A medical student could upload a scientific article about neuroscience and tell NotebookLM to “create a glossary of key terms related to dopamine”</li><li data-block-key="3a9ai">An author working on a biography could upload research notes and ask a question like: “Summarize all the times Houdini and Conan Doyle interacted.”</li></ul></li><li data-block-key="9k9mv"><b>Generate ideas:</b> NotebookLM isn’t just for Q&amp;A. We’ve found some of its more delightful and useful capabilities are when it’s able to help people come up with creative new ideas. For example:<ul><li data-block-key="d158b">A content creator could upload their ideas for new videos and ask: “Generate a script for a short video on this topic.”</li><li data-block-key="be0fh">Or an entrepreneur raising money could upload their pitch and ask: “What questions would potential investors ask?”</li></ul></li></ul><p data-block-key="4t4o4">While NotebookLM’s source-grounding does seem to reduce the risk of model “hallucinations,” it’s always important to fact-check the AI’s responses against your original source material. When you're drawing on multiple sources, we make that fact-checking easy by accompanying each response with citations, showing you the most relevant original quotes from your sources.</p></div>
