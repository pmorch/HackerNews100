<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="article" data-autopogo="">
<p>To its critics, it seems Ticketmaster may be experiencing some <a href="https://mashable.com/article/taylor-swift-eras-tour-ticketmaster-statement" target="_self"><u>karma</u></a> lately for years of being the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/swifties-take-down-ticketmaster-eras-tour" target="_self"><u>bane of concertgoers' existence</u></a>. Unfortunately its latest hassle — a massive data leak — also negatively impacts consumers.</p><p>Just last week, the U.S. Justice Department <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ticketmaster-lawsuit-live-nation" target="_self"><u>filed an antitrust lawsuit</u></a> against the ticketing conglomerate. The DOJ is seeking to break up the alleged monopoly its parent company, Live Nation Entertainment, holds over the live music and entertainment industry – potentially a good thing for consumers.</p><p>But Amid this nightmare for the company, a hacker group is now claiming to have stolen more than 500 million Ticketmaster customers' data in an attack.</p>
<p>Originally reported by cybersecurity outlets like <a href="https://www.hackread.com/hackers-ticketmaster-data-breach-560m-users-sale/" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)"><u>Hackread</u></a> and <a href="https://www.cyberdaily.au/security/10632-hackers-claim-ticketmaster-live-nation-data-breach-more-than-500m-compromised" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)"><u>Cyber Daily</u></a>, The "notorious hacker group" ShinyHunters is claiming responsibility for the breach affecting roughly 560 million Ticketmaster customers. The hacker group is selling the 1.3 terabyte-sized trove of data for a one-time price of $500,000 on a popular hacking forum.</p><h2><strong>What Ticketmaster data was stolen?</strong></h2><p>According to ShinyHunters, this is an immense trove of sensitive user data.&nbsp;</p><p>The group allegedly has Ticketmaster customers' full names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and order history information including ticket purchase details and Ticketmaster event information.&nbsp;</p><section x-data="window.newsletter()" x-init="init()" data-ga-impression="" data-ga-category="newsletters" data-ga-module="incontent_nl_signup" data-ga-label="mashablelightspeed">

</p>


</section>
<p>In addition, hackers also allegedly have customers' partial payment data which includes names, the last four digits of their credit card numbers, and card expiration dates.</p><p>Again, this sensitive data is connected to roughly half a billion users.</p><p>Mashable has reached out to Ticketmaster and will update this piece when we hear back.</p><h2><strong>How did this happen?</strong></h2><p>As of the publishing of this article, it's unclear exactly how ShinyHunters carried out its attack. Ticketmaster has yet to comment on the situation or corroborate the hackers' claims.</p><p>However, Australia's Home Affairs Department has <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-05-29/ticketmaster-hack-allegedlyshinyhunter-customers-data-leaked/103908614" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)"><u>confirmed</u></a> a "cyber incident impacting Ticketmaster customers." Due to the time frame in which the hackers shared their breach, it appears Australian outlets were the first to cover the news.</p><p>Ticketmaster has struggled with bad actors online using bots and other methods to disrupt the ticketing service and scoop up tickets to resell. The company also has a history of being the bad actor itself when it comes to electronic data. In 2020, the company agreed to pay <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/30/22206955/ticketmaster-songkick-crowdsurge-hacking-deferred-prosecution-fine" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)"><u>$10 million</u></a> to rival ticketing company SongKick after individuals on Ticketmaster's payroll obtained login credentials and gained unauthorized access to its competitors' computers.</p><p>As for ShinyHunters, Mashable has had a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/mashable-data-security-issue" target="_self"><u>prior run-in</u></a> with the hacker group as the company was once a victim of its <a href="https://www.hackread.com/shinyhunters-hacker-leaks-mashable-database/" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)"><u>attacks</u></a> in 2020. ShinyHunters was able to breach a database connected to a since-disabled Mashable feature that allowed readers to login to the site with their social media accounts from services like Facebook. The stolen data included information like email addresses but did not include more sensitive data like passwords or financial details.</p><p>According to ShinyHunters, the group attempted to contact Ticketmaster about the breach but have yet to receive a response.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="content-gate" data-sophi-feature="article body"><p><i>Kate Robertson is a senior research associate and Ron Deibert is director at the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab.</i></p><p>A federal cybersecurity bill, slated to advance through Parliament soon, contains secretive, encryption-breaking powers that the government has been loath to talk about. And they threaten the online security of everyone in Canada.</p><p>Bill C-26 empowers government officials to secretly order telecommunications companies to install backdoors inside encrypted elements in Canada’s networks. This could include requiring telcos to alter the<a href="https://www.3gpp.org/3gpp-groups/service-system-aspects-sa/sa-wg3"> 5G encryption standards</a> that protect mobile communications to facilitate government surveillance.</p><p>The government’s decision to push the proposed law forward without amending it to remove this encryption-breaking capability has set off alarm bells that these new powers are a feature, not a bug.</p><p>There are already many insecurities in today’s networks, reaching down to the infrastructure layers of communication technology. The Signalling System No. 7, developed in 1975 to route phone calls, has<a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2020/12/running-in-circles-uncovering-the-clients-of-cyberespionage-firm-circles/"> become a major source of insecurity</a> for cellphones. In 2017, the CBC demonstrated how<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/hackers-cellphone-security-1.4406338"> hackers only needed a Canadian MP’s cell number</a> to intercept his movements, text messages and phone calls. Little has changed since: A<a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2023/10/finding-you-teleco-vulnerabilities-for-location-disclosure/"> 2023 Citizen Lab report</a> details pervasive vulnerabilities at the heart of the world’s mobile networks.</p><p>So it makes no sense that the Canadian government would itself seek the ability to create more holes, rather than patching them. Yet it is pushing for potential new powers that would infect next-generation cybersecurity tools with old diseases.</p><p>It’s not as if the government wasn’t warned. Citizen Lab researchers<a href="https://www.ourcommons.ca/Content/Committee/441/SECU/Brief/BR12829919/br-external/CitizenLab-Combine-e.pdf"> presented the 2023 report’s findings</a> in parliamentary hearings on Bill C-26, and <a href="https://www.ourcommons.ca/Content/Committee/441/SECU/Brief/BR12566103/br-external/Jointly1-e.pdf">leaders and experts in civil society</a> and in Canada’s<a href="https://www.ourcommons.ca/documentviewer/en/44-1/SECU/meeting-94/evidence#Int-12577753"> telecommunications industry</a> warned that the bill must be narrowed to prevent its broad powers to compel<a href="https://www.parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/bill/C-26/second-reading#:~:text=telecommunications%20service%20provider.-,Order,-(2)"> technical changes</a> from being used to compromise the <a href="https://www.ourcommons.ca/Content/Committee/441/SECU/Brief/BR12566103/br-external/Jointly1-e.pdf">”confidentiality, integrity, or availability”</a> of telecommunication services. And yet, while government MPs maintained that their intent is not to expand surveillance capabilities, MPs pushed the bill out of committee without this critical amendment last month. In doing so, the government has set itself up to be the sole arbiter of when, and on what conditions, Canadians deserve security for their most confidential communications – personal, business, religious, or otherwise.</p><p>The new powers would only make people in Canada more vulnerable to malicious threats to the privacy and security of all network users, including<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/imsi-cellphones-spying-ottawa-1.4050049"> Canada’s most senior officials</a>. Encryption of 5G technology safeguards a web of connection points surrounding mobile communications, and protects users from man-in-the-middle attacks that intercept their text and voice communications or location data. The law would also impact <a href="https://www.cyber.gc.ca/en/guidance/cyber-security-considerations-5g-networks-itsap80116?ref=busrides.ghost.io">cloud-connected smart devices like cars, home CCTV, or pacemakers</a>, and<a href="https://www.cyber.gc.ca/en/guidance/satellite-communications-itsap80029"> satellite-based services like Starlink</a> – all of which could be compromised by any new vulnerabilities.</p><p>Unfortunately, history is rife with<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/05/nsa-gchq-encryption-codes-security"> government backdoors</a> exposing individuals to deep levels of cyber-insecurity. Backdoors can be exploited by law enforcement, criminals and foreign rivals alike. For this reason, past heads of<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/michael-hayden-encryption-apple-2016-2"> the CIA, the NSA</a> and<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/07/former-national-security-officials-see-the-peril-of-weakening-encryption/399848/"> the U.S. Department of Homeland Security</a>, as well as Britain’s Government Communications Headquarters<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2017/07/10/former_gchq_wades_into_encryption_debate/"> (GCHQ</a>) and<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/aug/11/ex-mi5-chief-warns-against-crackdown-encrypted-messaging-apps"> MI5</a>, all oppose measures that would weaken encryption. Interception equipment relied upon by governments<a href="https://theintercept.com/2015/09/28/death-athens-rogue-nsa-operation/"> has also often been shown</a> to have<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/05/root-backdoor-found-in-surveillance-gear-used-by-law-enforcement/"> significant security weaknesses</a>.</p><p>The bill’s new spy powers also reveal incoherence in the government’s cybersecurity strategy. In 2022, Canada announced it would be blocking telecom equipment from Huawei and ZTE, citing the “<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/innovation-science-economic-development/news/2022/05/policy-statement--securing-canadas-telecommunications-system.html">cascading economic and security impacts</a>” that a supply-chain breach would engender. The government cited concerns that the Chinese firms might be “<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/innovation-science-economic-development/news/2022/05/policy-statement--securing-canadas-telecommunications-system.html">compelled to comply with extrajudicial directions from foreign governments</a>.” And yet, Bill C-26 would quietly provide Canada with the same authority that it publicly condemned. If the bill passes as-is, all telecom providers in Canada would be compellable through secret orders to weaken encryption or network equipment. It doesn’t just contradict Canada’s own<a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2019/08/canadas-new-and-irresponsible-encryption-policy-how-the-government-of-canadas-new-policy-threatens-charter-rights-cybersecurity-economic-growth-and-foreign-policy/"> pro-encryption policy</a> and<a href="https://www.cyber.gc.ca/en/guidance/satellite-communications-itsap80029#:~:text=Ensure%20SATCOM%20equipment"> expert guidance</a> – authoritarian governments abroad would also be able to point to Canada’s law to justify their own repressive security legislation.</p><p>Now, more than ever, there is no such thing as a safe backdoor. The GCHQ<a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/report/commercial-cyber-proliferation-assessment"> reports</a> that the threat from commercial hacking firms will be “transformational on the cyber landscape,” and that cyber mercenaries wield capabilities rivalling that of state cyber-agencies. If the Canadian government compels telcos to undermine security features to accommodate surveillance, it will pave the way for<a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2020/12/running-in-circles-uncovering-the-clients-of-cyberespionage-firm-circles/"> cyberespionage firms</a> and other adversaries to find<a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2023/09/predator-in-the-wires-ahmed-eltantawy-targeted-with-predator-spyware-after-announcing-presidential-ambitions/"> more ways</a> into<a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2018/03/bad-traffic-sandvines-packetlogic-devices-deploy-government-spyware-turkey-syria/"> people’s communications</a>. A shortcut that provides a narrow advantage for the few at the expense of us all is no way to secure our complex digital ecosystem.</p><p>Against this threat landscape, a pivot is crucial. Canada needs cybersecurity laws that explicitly recognize that uncompromised encryption is the backbone of cybersecurity, and it must be mandated and protected by all means possible.</p></article></div>]]></description>

I wasn’t ready to sell, but I wanted to understand the path to an exit.</p><p>FE initially seemed interested. Then, after a few email exchanges and seeing my financials, they gave me a soft brushoff:</p><blockquote><p>Unfortunately, with the current set up of two main SKUs generating roughly 98% of your revenue, this would not be a good fit for most buyers. Buyers typically want to see that a business has a minimum of 10 SKUs, and that none of these SKUs generate more than 30% of revenue.</p><p>At this time we would advise, in preparation for a sale to start to consider increasing your product offering. These don’t always have to be completely new products, and this could also be USB-C cables, wall plugs, ethernet cables, servers, display ports, HDMI cables etc, this would also help to increase your AOV.</p></blockquote><p>After FE’s rejection, I felt trapped and panicked.</p><p>I had invested hundreds of thousands of dollars into software and hardware engineering to make just one product, and I was barely scraping by. According to FE, I had no chance of selling unless I did <em>ten times</em> as much as I was currently doing?</p><h3 id="if-you-cant-get-out-get-comfortable">If you can’t get out, get comfortable<a href="#if-you-cant-get-out-get-comfortable" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h3><p>I didn’t want to shut down the company and lay everyone off, but I also didn’t want to carry the stress of running TinyPilot for the rest of my life. So, I looked for ways to make the business less stressful.</p><p>One of the most difficult parts of TinyPilot was hardware revisions. We were always redesigning TinyPilot’s hardware to make improvements, but that meant constantly finding new suppliers and rethinking our manufacturing pipeline. In 2023, I decided to keep the design we had and stop fiddling with the hardware.</p><p>The other source of complexity was TinyPilot’s office. We were still doing everything in-house: managing inventory, assembling devices, and fulfilling orders. I worked with TinyPilot’s in-person team to migrate the office’s core functions to external vendors. It was a major challenge to outsource so many delicate processes, but it eliminated an enormous amount of management overhead and stress.</p><p>The happy side-effect of making TinyPilot easier to manage was that it also made the company more attractive to potential buyers. When I stopped pouring $100k/year into hardware improvements, the company became <a href="https://mtlynch.io/solo-developer-year-6/#tinypilot-became-20x-more-profitable">substantially more profitable</a>. And without an office and custom in-house manufacturing, a prospective owner could run TinyPilot from anywhere in the world.</p><h2 id="part-2-starting-the-sales-process">Part 2: Starting the sales process<a href="#part-2-starting-the-sales-process" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h2><h3 id="the-strategic-acquirer">The strategic acquirer<a href="#the-strategic-acquirer" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h3><p>With the company in stronger shape, I decided to restart my search for a buyer. Going through a broker didn’t work, so I began contacting buyers on my own.</p><p>In his book <a href="https://books.builttosell.com/sp/the-art-of-selling-your-business-free-book-landing-page/"><em>The Art of Selling Your Business</em></a>, John Warrilow encourages founders to seek acquisitions from “strategic buyers,” companies that could use your business as part of their growth strategy.</p><p>For example, if you’re a salsa company that consistently makes $100k/year, a typical buyer might acquire you for $300k. But a buyer who already manufactures tortilla chips would see obvious synergy between the two businesses, so your salsa company would be worth $400k-600k to them.</p><p><a href="https://mtlynch.io/i-sold-tinypilot/synergy.webp"><img sizes="(min-width: 768px) 400px, 98vw" srcset="https://mtlynch.io/i-sold-tinypilot/synergy_hu7952c8db89898233b2b0034f1600749c_64090_300x0_resize_q90_h2_lanczos_2.webp 300w,

Most ignored me or gave polite brushoffs, but one company showed immediate interest. I’ll call them ServerCo.</p><p>ServerCo was an attractive buyer. They were bootstrapped as well, they seemed culturally aligned with TinyPilot, and we sold complementary products to similar customers. Having never participated in an acquisition before, they were cautious but enthusiastic about buying TinyPilot.</p><p>ServerCo would email me a list of detailed questions about TinyPilot’s finances and risks, I’d answer in a day or two, and then there’d be weeks of silence. Finally, they’d respond with a new round of questions, and we’d start the cycle again.</p><p>After four months of intermittent discussions, ServerCo finally presented me with an offer:</p><ul><li>$150k cash</li><li>$100k employment contract for 12 months of full-time work</li><li>25% of TinyPilot’s profit the first year after closing</li><li>10% of TinyPilot’s profit the second year after closing</li></ul><p>They didn’t intend it to be an insultingly bad offer, but it was a pretty bad offer.</p><p>eCommerce companies typically sell for 2.5-3.5x earnings. The cash portiton of ServerCo’s offer was 0.9x TinyPilot’s earnings.</p><p>As for the salary, $100k/year is roughly what a software developer makes fresh out of college in the US. And that’s without a 12-month commitment.</p><p>I politely told ServerCo we were too far apart on price to continue negotiating, but we both agreed to keep the door open in case things changed.</p><h3 id="attending-microconf-and-meeting-quiet-light-brokerage">Attending Microconf and meeting Quiet Light Brokerage<a href="#attending-microconf-and-meeting-quiet-light-brokerage" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h3><p>In 2023, I attended <a href="https://microconf.com/">Microconf</a>, a small conference for bootstrapped founders. I hoped that to either find a potential buyer there or at least get advice from other founders about what to do with TinyPilot.</p><p>One of the sponsors of the conference was a brokerage I’d never heard of, <a href="https://quietlight.com/">Quiet Light</a>. They piqued my interest because not only did they cater to bootstrapped founders, they worked with a lot of eCommerce companies.</p><p>At the event, I spoke with Chris Guthrie, an advisor at Quiet Light. He seemed optimistic about selling TinyPilot, so after the conference, he began working with me on a sales package. It was a set of documents and financial reports to show prospective TinyPilot buyers. It included a profit and loss statement for the past two years, a detailed questionnaire about the company, and a brief video interview with me.</p><p>Chris recommened presenting TinyPilot mainly as an eCommerce business with an asking price of around 3x the last twelve months of earnings. At the time, earnings were $208k, so we agreed to list at $599k, roughly 2.9x earnings.</p><figure><a href="https://mtlynch.io/i-sold-tinypilot/quiet-light-launch.png"><img sizes="(min-width: 768px) 341px, 98vw" srcset="https://mtlynch.io/i-sold-tinypilot/quiet-light-launch_hu58a1ce4bcdea9c64c583963da37b7ca2_18956_300x0_resize_lanczos_3.png 300w,

Chris received a handful of inquiries, but they were from buyers who either wanted me to stay on as a co-founder or wanted me to finance the majority of the purchase.</p><h3 id="serious-buyers-finally-appear">Serious buyers finally appear<a href="#serious-buyers-finally-appear" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h3><p>Finally, in January, two attractive buyers appeared around the same time.</p><p>The first buyer was Scott, who worked a corporate job in media production but had grown disilussioned with big company culture, much like I had. He’d read my <a href="https://mtlynch.io/retrospectives/">public retrospectives about building TinyPilot</a> and saw potential to bring the product to a broader customer base.</p><p>The other offer was from a pair of founders. They were initially TinyPilot customers and had reached out to me about building a managed services company on top of the product. When I told them I was selling the company, they were interested in buying.</p><h3 id="soliciting-lois">Soliciting LOIs<a href="#soliciting-lois" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h3><p>The sales process officially starts with the letter of intent (LOI). The LOI lays out the high-level details of the sale, the most important being the purchase price.</p><p>Crucially, the LOI isn’t binding. The document that really matters is the asset purchase agreement (APA), which you sign when the deal closes. But the LOI officially kicks off due diligence and the drafting of the APA.</p><p>When we started LOI discussions, I was in an excellent negotiation position. I had two serious buyers competing against each other. Since listing on Quiet Light, TinyPilot’s annual earnings had increased by $10k, and we received pre-qualification for an SBA loan, which meant buyers who didn’t have $599k in cash could now get a government-backed loan to buy the business.</p><p>Chris told the two prospective buyers that we were planning to re-launch on Quiet Light at $625k but that I’d honor the original price if they made an offer within the next two weeks.</p><h3 id="price-negotiations">Price negotiations<a href="#price-negotiations" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h3><p>Scott made the first formal offer, but it was for $500k, a steep $99k drop from my asking price. At that point, I had several attractive alternatives, so I declined.</p><p>We awaited an offer from the founder duo, who had sounded eager to move forward. Two days later, they backed out without making an offer at all.</p><p>Uh oh. Did I blow the deal? What if $500k was the best I was going to get, and I just rejected it? I still had the option of re-launching on Quiet Light, but seeing both buyers reject the asking price shook my confidence.</p><p>Fortunately, the next day, Scott sent a new LOI for my $599k asking price, and I accepted.</p><p>It was great to bump the price by $99k, but that was the last point in the process that felt like I was negotiating from a position of strength.</p><h2 id="part-3-closing">Part 3: Closing<a href="#part-3-closing" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h2><h3 id="due-diligence-makes-me-weaker-by-the-day">Due diligence makes me weaker by the day<a href="#due-diligence-makes-me-weaker-by-the-day" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h3><p>One of the biggest surprises in this process was how much closing time matters.</p><p>Chris from Quiet Light had recommended selling, if at all possible, to a buyer with cash on hand rather than someone who needs a loan. When the buyer finances the purchase with a bank loan, due diligence takes longer, and there are more decision-makers who can kill the deal.</p><p>At the time, I thought, “Faster would be better, but I’m a patient person. What’s an extra two months?”</p><p>I quickly learned that a slower closing isn’t about a few months of patience — it’s about how much additional risk and work the seller absorbs with each passing week of due diligence.</p><p>When you sell a house, the buyer has to put down a deposit of 1-5% to hold their claim on the house. If financing falls through or the buyer changes their mind, the seller keeps the money as compensation for the time they lost.</p><p>When you sell a business at TinyPilot’s scale, there’s no deposit. You can invest hundreds of hours into preparing reports for due diligence, reveal all your confidential business secrets, and spend thousands of dollars negotiating legal documents and still walk away with nothing if the buyer backs out.</p><p>As due diligence stretched on, my negotiating position became markedly weaker. Before signing the LOI, I could easily move on to the next buyer. By month two of due diligence, walking away from the deal meant restarting this costly and time-consuming process from zero. I’d also risk TinyPilot’s sales slipping after so many months being distracted from the business.</p><p><a href="https://mtlynch.io/i-sold-tinypilot/due-diligence.webp"><img sizes="(min-width: 768px) 1600px, 98vw" srcset="https://mtlynch.io/i-sold-tinypilot/due-diligence_hu1dfd9cb7b73d57c6fe3bcd530cd22ae5_257278_300x0_resize_q90_h2_lanczos_2.webp 300w,

Finally, on April 3rd, Scott’s bank approved the deal. They recommended a closing date of Friday, April 12th.</p><p>That final week was the longest week of my life. I didn’t know what to do with myself.</p><p>The only thing I could find motivation for was ruminating about all the things that might go wrong. What if the buyer got cold feet? What if Google announced an identical product and gave it away for free? What if our manufacturer spontaneously went out of business?</p><p>It felt like I was on my way to my retirement party, but there was a 5% chance that when I got there, my boss would say, “Gotcha! You’re not really retiring. Now, work extra hard to make up for all the time you wasted preparing to leave.”</p><p>On closing day, I couldn’t focus on anything at all. I woke up at 4 AM and couldn’t fall back to sleep. I couldn’t do anything that required even basic thinking, and I couldn’t relax enough to watch TV, so I started disassembling some old TinyPilot devices while checking my email every 90 seconds.</p><p>Finally, at 2 PM, I received the email I’d been waiting for all day.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We introduce Codestral, our first-ever code model. Codestral is an
open-weight generative AI model explicitly designed for code generation
tasks. It helps developers write and interact with code through a shared
instruction and completion API endpoint. As it masters code and English,
it can be used to design advanced AI applications for software
developers.</p><h4 id="a-model-fluent-in-80-programming-languages">A model fluent in 80+ programming languages</h4><p>Codestral is trained on a diverse dataset of 80+ programming languages,
including the most popular ones, such as Python, Java, C, C++,
JavaScript, and Bash. It also performs well on more specific ones like
Swift and Fortran. This broad language base ensures Codestral can assist
developers in various coding environments and projects.</p><p>Codestral saves developers time and effort: it can complete coding
functions, write tests, and complete any partial code using a
fill-in-the-middle mechanism. Interacting with Codestral will help level
up the developer’s coding game and reduce the risk of errors and bugs.</p><h4 id="setting-the-bar-for-code-generation-performance">Setting the Bar for Code Generation Performance</h4><p><strong>Performance.</strong> As a 22B model, Codestral sets a new standard on the
performance/latency space for code generation compared to previous
models used for coding.</p><p><img src="https://mistral.ai/images/news/codestral/General_table.png" alt="Detailed benchmarks" width="100%"></p><p>Figure 1: With its larger context window of 32k (compared to 4k, 8k or 16k for
competitors), Codestral outperforms all other models in RepoBench, a
long-range eval for code generation..</p><p>We compare Codestral to existing code-specific models with higher
hardware requirements.</p><p><strong>Python.</strong> We use four benchmarks: HumanEval pass@1, MBPP sanitised
pass@1 to evaluate Codestral’s Python code generation ability, CruxEval
to evaluate Python output prediction, and RepoBench EM to evaluate
Codestral’s Long-Range Repository-Level Code Completion.</p><p><strong>SQL.</strong> To evaluate Codestral’s performance in SQL, we used the Spider
benchmark.</p><p><img src="https://mistral.ai/images/news/codestral/HumanEval_table.png" alt="Detailed benchmarks" width="100%"></p><p>Additional languages. Additionally, we evaluated Codestral's performance in multiple HumanEval pass@1 across six different languages
in addition to Python: C++, bash, Java, PHP, Typescript, and C#, and
calculated the average of these evaluations.</p><p><img src="https://mistral.ai/images/news/codestral/FIM_table.png" alt="Detailed benchmarks" width="100%"></p><p>FIM benchmarks. Codestral's Fill-in-the-middle performance was assessed using HumanEval pass@1 in Python, JavaScript, and Java and
compared to DeepSeek Coder 33B, whose fill-in-the-middle capacity is
immediately usable.</p><h4 id="get-started-with-codestral">Get started with Codestral</h4><h5 id="download-and-test-codestral">Download and test Codestral.</h5><p>Codestral is a 22B open-weight model licensed under the new <em><a href="https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-ai-non-production-license-mnpl/">Mistral AI
Non-Production License</a></em>, which means that you can use it for research
and testing purposes. Codestral can be downloaded on <a href="https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Codestral-22B-v0.1">HuggingFace</a>.</p><h5 id="use-codestral-via-its-dedicated-endpoint">Use Codestral via its dedicated endpoint</h5><p>With this release, comes the addition of a new endpoint: <code>codestral.mistral.ai</code>.
This endpoint should be preferred by users who use our Instruct or Fill-In-the-Middle routes inside their IDE.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="storywrap-441774">


<h3>from the <i>crystal-clear-priorities</i> dept</h3>

<p>The U.S. yet yet to pass even a basic internet-era privacy law — or regulate data brokers. And while there’s a lot of misdirection and pretense to the contrary, the primary reason is (1) because the U.S. government is too corrupt; and (2)<strong> </strong>because the U.S. government really enjoys being able to purchase massive amounts of sensitive citizen data from data brokers without having to get a pesky warrant. </p>
<p>The end result has been just a <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2024/02/15/wyden-data-broker-used-abortion-clinic-visitor-location-data-to-help-send-targeted-misinformation-to-vulnerable-women/">parade of dangerous scandals</a> in which dodgy companies hoover up oceans of sensitive user data, then sell access to any nitwit <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2024/02/15/wyden-data-broker-used-abortion-clinic-visitor-location-data-to-help-send-targeted-misinformation-to-vulnerable-women/">with two nickels to rub together</a>. Given foreign intelligence can easily buy this data, our corruption poses a severe national security threat; but instead of fixing it, Congress likes to distract folks with endless hysteria about a single app: TikTok. </p>
<p>But it’s amusing to see the government work quickly when they think it’s something that <em>might impact the affluent personally</em>. Case in point: Congress is too corrupt to protect consumer privacy, but they <strong>did</strong> manage to <a href="https://www.popsci.com/technology/tracking-private-jets/">pass a new privacy law specifically designed to protect the privacy of affluent jet owners</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The latest&nbsp;<a href="https://www.popsci.com/technology/boeing-faa-audit/">Federal Aviation Administration</a>&nbsp;reauthorization bill contains a pointed amendment within it—the government is making it much more difficult to monitor and track private aircraft travel. The new law passed last week will almost exclusively benefit the nation’s wealthiest flyers and obscure public attempts to hold them accountable for their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.popsci.com/technology/airport-private-plane-ban/">disproportionate carbon emissions</a>.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/118th-congress/house-report/147/1">new law</a> lets private jet owners censor most meaningful travel details (call signs, flight numbers, travel patterns) through a new application process in which they claim the data must remain confidential due to ambiguous “safety or security” needs. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/pwnallthethings.bsky.social/post/3ktb2joryq22i">Folks over at Bluesky</a> dug into the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/118th-congress/house-report/147/1">specific language of the reauthorization bill</a> and found it was inserted by Republican Rep. Bruce Westerman of Arkansas. </p>
<p>Jack Sweeney, the jet tracking student who made Elon Musk cry like a baby, says the law won’t <strong>completely</strong> block the tracking of jets, given they can still glean a lot of detail from general contextual clues. But it’s still amusing how quickly and easily Congress is able to shore up lax U.S. privacy safeguards when it’s to the specific benefit of the rich. </p>
<p>The thing is, letting dodgy, unregulated data brokers monetize everybody’s sensitive movement and behavior data harms poor people, rich people, and everybody in between. Right now most members of Congress view these privacy issues as somebody <strong>else’s</strong> problem, but at some point there’s going to be an unprecedented privacy scandal tied to data brokers that shatters that delusion in very painful ways.</p>
<p>The government has repeatedly made the choice to prioritize making money over consumer and market health, public safety, and national security. And eventually, an event is going to come along that makes the kind of scandals we’ve seen so far (from <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2019/03/11/apparently-easy-to-pretend-to-be-cop-grab-location-data-cellular-carriers/">stalkers abusing cellular location data</a> to right wing activists abusing abortion clinic visitor data <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2024/02/15/wyden-data-broker-used-abortion-clinic-visitor-location-data-to-help-send-targeted-misinformation-to-vulnerable-women/">to send targeted misinformation</a>) look like a grade school picnic.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-permalink-context="/2024/May/29/training-not-chatting/">

<p>29th May 2024</p>

<p>I’m beginning to suspect that one of the most common <a href="https://simonwillison.net/series/llm-misconceptions/">misconceptions about LLMs</a> such as ChatGPT involves how “training” works.</p>
<p>A common complaint I see about these tools is that people don’t want to even try them out because they don’t want to contribute to their training data.</p>
<p>This is by no means an irrational position to take, but it does often correspond to an incorrect mental model about how these tools work.</p>
<p>Short version: ChatGPT and other similar tools <strong>do not directly learn from and memorize everything that you say to them</strong>.</p>
<p>This can be quite unintuitive: these tools imitate a human conversational partner, and humans constantly update their knowledge based on what you say to to them. Computers have much better memory than humans, so surely ChatGPT would remember every detail of everything you ever say to it. Isn’t that what “training” means?</p>
<p>That’s not how these tools work.</p>
<h4 id="llms-are-stateless-functions">LLMs are stateless functions</h4>
<p>From a computer science point of view, it’s best to think of LLMs as stateless function calls. Given this input text, what should come next?</p>
<p>In the case of a “conversation” with a chatbot such as ChatGPT or Claude or Google Gemini, that function input consists of the current conversation (everything said by both the human and the bot) up to that point, plus the user’s new prompt.</p>
<p>Every time you start a new chat conversation, you clear the slate. Each conversation is an entirely new sequence, carried out entirely independently of previous conversations from both yourself and other users.</p>
<p>Understanding this is key to working effectively with these models. Every time you hit “new chat” you are effectively wiping the short-term memory of the model, starting again from scratch.</p>
<p>This has a number of important consequences:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is no point at all in “telling” a model something in order to improve its knowledge for future conversations. I’ve heard from people who have invested weeks of effort pasting new information into ChatGPT sessions to try and “train” a better bot. That’s a waste of time!</li>
<li>Understanding this helps explain why the “context length” of a model is so important. Different LLMs have different context lengths, expressed in terms of “tokens”—a token is about 3/4s of a word. This is the number that tells you how much of a conversation the bot can consider at any one time. If your conversation goes past this point the model will “forget” details that occurred at the beginning of the conversation.</li>
<li>Sometimes it’s a good idea to start a fresh conversation in order to deliberately reset the model. If a model starts making obvious mistakes, or refuses to respond to a valid question for some weird reason that reset might get it back on the right track.</li>
<li>Tricks like <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/rag/">Retrieval Augmented Generation</a> and <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Feb/14/memory-and-new-controls-for-chatgpt/">ChatGPT’s “memory”</a> make sense only once you understand this fundamental limitation to how these models work.</li>
<li>If you’re excited about local models because you can be certain there’s no way they can train on your data, you’re mostly right: you can run them offline and audit your network traffic to be absolutely sure your data isn’t being uploaded to a server somewhere. But...</li>
<li>... if you’re excited about local models because you want something on your computer that you can chat to and it will learn from you and then better respond to your future prompts, that’s probably not going to work.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="so-what-is-training-then-">So what is “training” then?</h4>
<p>When we talk about model training, we are talking about the process that was used to build these models in the first place.</p>
<p>As a big simplification, there are two phases to this. The first is to pile in several TBs of text—think all of Wikipedia, a scrape of a large portion of the web, books, newspapers, academic papers and more—and spend months of time and potentially millions of dollars in electricity crunching through that “pre-training” data identifying patterns in how the words relate to each other.</p>
<p>This gives you a model that can complete sentences, but not necessarily in a way that will delight and impress a human conversational partner. The second phase aims to fix that—this can incorporate instruction tuning or Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) which has the goal of teaching the model to pick the best possible sequences of words to have productive conversations.</p>
<p>The end result of these phases is the model itself—an enormous (many GB) blob of floating point numbers that capture both the statistical relationships between the words and some version of “taste” in terms of how best to assemble new words to reply to a user’s prompts.</p>
<p>Once trained, the model remains static and unchanged—sometimes for months or even years.</p>
<p>Here’s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1c3f1yc/comment/kzj7n4s/">a note</a> from Jason D. Clinton, an engineer who works on Claude 3 at Anthropic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The model is stored in a static file and loaded, continuously, across 10s of thousands of identical servers each of which serve each instance of the Claude model. The model file never changes and is immutable once loaded; every shard is loading the same model file running exactly the same software.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These models don’t change very often!</p>
<h4 id="reasons-to-worry-anyway">Reasons to worry anyway</h4>
<p>A frustrating thing about this issue is that it isn’t actually possible to confidently state “don’t worry, ChatGPT doesn’t train on your input”.</p>
<p>Many LLM providers have terms and conditions that allow them to improve their models based on the way you are using them. Even when they have opt-out mechanisms these are often opted-in by default.</p>
<p>When OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use/">say</a> “We may use Content to provide, maintain, develop, and improve our Services” it’s not at all clear what they mean by that!</p>
<p>Are they storing up everything anyone says to their models and dumping that into the training run for their next model versions every few months?</p>
<p>I don’t think it’s that simple: LLM providers don’t want random low-quality text or privacy-invading details making it into their training data. But they are notoriously secretive, so who knows for sure?</p>
<p>The opt-out mechanisms are also pretty confusing. OpenAI try to make it as clear as possible that they won’t train on any content submitted through their API (so you had better understand what an “API” is), but lots of people don’t believe them! I wrote about <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Dec/14/ai-trust-crisis/">the AI trust crisis</a> last year: the pattern where many people actively disbelieve model vendors and application developers (such as Dropbox and Slack) that claim they don’t train models on private data.</p>
<p>People also worry that those terms might change in the future. There are options to protect against that: if you’re spending enough money you can <a href="https://twitter.com/therealadamg/status/1794693810204909729">sign contracts with OpenAI</a> and other vendors that freeze the terms and conditions.</p>
<p>If your mental model is that LLMs remember and train on all input, it’s much easier to assume that developers who claim they’ve disabled that ability may not be telling the truth. If you tell your human friend to disregard a juicy piece of gossip you’ve mistakenly passed on to them you know full well that they’re not going to forget it!</p>
<p>The other major concern is the same as with any cloud service: it’s reasonable to assume that your prompts are still logged for a period of time, for compliance and abuse reasons, and if that data is logged there’s always a chance of exposure thanks to an accidental security breach.</p>

<h4 id="memory-features">What about “memory” features?</h4>

<p>To make things even more confusing, some LLM tools are introducing features that attempt to work around this limitation.</p>

<p>ChatGPT recently added a <a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8590148-memory-faq">memory feature</a> where it can “remember” small details and use them in follow-up conversations.</p>

<p>As with so many LLM features this is a relatively simple prompting trick: during a conversation the bot can call a mechanism to record a short note—your name, is a preference you have expressed—which will then be invisibly included in the chat context passed in future conversations.</p>

<p>You can review (and modify) the list of remembered fragments at any time, and ChatGPT shows a visible UI element any time it adds to its memory.</p>

<h4 id="bad-policy-based-on-bad-mental-models">Bad policy based on bad mental models</h4>
<p>One of the most worrying results of this common misconception concerns people who make policy decisions for how LLM tools should be used.</p>
<p>Does your company ban all use of LLMs because they don’t want their private data leaked to the model providers?</p>
<p>They’re not 100% wrong—see <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/May/29/training-not-chatting/#reasons-to-worry-anyway">reasons to worry anyway</a>—but if they are acting based on the idea that everything said to a model is instantly memorized and could be used in responses to other users they’re acting on faulty information.</p>
<p>Even more concerning is what happens with lawmakers. How many politicians around the world are debating and voting on legislation involving these models based on a science fiction idea of what they are and how they work?</p>
<p>If people believe ChatGPT is a machine that instantly memorizes and learns from everything anyone says to it there is a very real risk they will support measures that address invented as opposed to genuine risks involving this technology.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>A trove of leaked Google documents has given us an unprecedented look inside Google Search and revealed some of the most important elements Google uses to rank content.</p>



<p><strong>What happened.</strong> Thousands of documents, which appear to come from Google’s internal Content API Warehouse, were released <a href="https://github.com/yoshi-code-bot/elixir-google-api/commit/d7a637f4391b2174a2cf43ee11e6577a204a161e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">March 13 on Github</a> by an automated bot called yoshi-code-bot. These documents were shared with Rand Fishkin, SparkToro co-founder, earlier this month.</p>



<ul>
<li>Read on to discover what we’ve learned from Fishkin, as well as Michael King, iPullRank CEO, who also reviewed and analyzed the documents (and plans to provide further analysis for Search Engine Land soon).</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Why we care.</strong> We have been given a glimpse into how Google’s ranking algorithm may work, which is invaluable for SEOs who can understand what it all means. In 2023, we got an <a href="https://searchengineland.com/yandex-leak-learnings-392393">unprecedented look at Yandex Search ranking factors</a> via a <a href="https://searchengineland.com/yandex-search-ranking-factors-leak-392323">leak</a>, which was one of the biggest stories of that year.</p><!-- /1038259/SEL_Post-text -->



<p>This Google document leak? It will likely be one of the biggest stories in the history of SEO and Google Search.</p>



<p><strong>What’s inside. </strong>Here’s what we know about the internal documents, thanks to Fishkin and King:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Current: </strong>The documentation indicates this information is accurate as of March.</li>



<li><strong>Ranking features:</strong> 2,596 modules are represented in the API documentation with 14,014 attributes.</li>



<li><strong>Weighting:</strong> The documents did not specify how any of the ranking features are weighted –&nbsp;just that they exist.</li>



<li><strong>Twiddlers:</strong> These are re-ranking functions that “can adjust the information retrieval score of a document or change the ranking of a document,” according to King.</li>



<li><strong>Demotions:</strong> Content can be demoted for a variety of reasons, such as:
<ul>
<li>A link doesn’t match the target site.</li>



<li>SERP signals indicate user dissatisfaction.</li>



<li>Product reviews.</li>



<li>Location.</li>



<li>Exact match domains.</li>



<li>Porn</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Change history:</strong> Google apparently keeps a copy of every version of every page it has ever indexed. Meaning, Google can “remember” every change ever made to a page. However, Google only uses the last 20 changes of a URL when analyzing links.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Links matter.</strong> Shocking, I know. Link diversity and relevance remain key, the documents show. And PageRank is still very much alive within Google’s ranking features. PageRank for a website’s homepage is considered for every document.</p>



<ul>
<li>This doesn’t prove Google spokespeople have lied about <a href="https://searchengineland.com/links-google-search-ranking-factor-gary-illyes-432422">links not being a “top 3 ranking factor”</a> or <a href="https://searchengineland.com/links-may-be-less-important-to-the-google-search-ranking-algorithm-in-the-future-389364">links mattering less for ranking</a>. Two things can be true at once. Again, we don’t know how any of these features are weighted. </li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Successful clicks matter.</strong> This should not be a shocker, but if you want to rank well, you need to keep creating great content and user experiences, based on the documents. Google uses a variety of measurements, including&nbsp;<strong>badClicks</strong>, <strong>goodClicks</strong>, <strong>lastLongestClicks</strong> and <strong>unsquashedClicks</strong>.</p>



<p>Also, longer documents may get truncated, while shorter content gets a score (from 0-512) based on originality. Scores are also given to Your Money Your Life content, like health and news.</p>



<p>What does it all mean? According to King:</p>



<ul>
<li>“[Y]ou need to drive more&nbsp;<em>successful&nbsp;</em>clicks using a broader set of queries and earn more link diversity if you want to continue to rank. Conceptually, it makes sense because a very strong piece of content will do that. A focus on driving more qualified traffic to a better user experience will send signals to Google that your page deserves to rank.”</li>
</ul>



<p>Documents and testimony from the <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-search-antirust-trial-hearing-updates-431977">U.S. vs. Google antitrust trial</a> confirmed that Google uses clicks in ranking – especially with its Navboost system, “one of the important signals” Google uses for ranking. See more from our coverage:</p>

<li><a href="https://searchengineland.com/how-google-search-ranking-works-pandu-nayak-435395">How Google Search and ranking works, according to Google’s Pandu Nayak</a></li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Brand matters.</strong> Fishkin’s big takeaway? Brand matters more than anything else:</p>



<ul>
<li>“If there was one universal piece of advice I had for marketers seeking to broadly improve their organic search rankings and traffic, it would be: ‘Build a notable, popular, well-recognized brand in your space, outside of Google search.'”</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Entities matter.</strong> <a href="https://searchengineland.com/authorship-dead-long-live-authorship-217209">Authorship lives</a>. Google stores author information associated with content and tries to determine whether an entity is the author of the document.</p>



<p><strong>SiteAuthority:</strong> Google uses something called “siteAuthority”. </p>



<ul>
<li>Google told us something like this existed in 2011, after the <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-panda-update-guide-381104">Panda update</a> launched, stating publicly that “low quality&nbsp;content&nbsp;on part of a site can impact a site’s ranking as a whole.” </li>



<li>However, <a href="https://www.seroundtable.com/google-no-website-authority-score-22874.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google has denied having a website authority score</a> in the years since then.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Chrome data.</strong> A module called <strong>ChromeInTotal</strong> indicates that Google uses data from its Chrome browser for ranking.</p>



<p><strong>Whitelists.</strong> A couple of modules indicate Google whitelist certain domains related to elections and COVID – <strong>isElectionAuthority</strong> and <strong>isCovidLocalAuthority</strong>. Though we’ve long known <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-bing-have-whitelistsexception-lists-for-algorithms-67732">Google (and Bing) have “exception lists”</a> when “specific algorithms inadvertently impact websites.”</p>



<p><strong>Small sites.</strong> Another feature is <strong>smallPersonalSite</strong> – for a small personal site or blog. King speculated that Google could boost or demote such sites via a Twiddler. However, that remains an open question. Again, we don’t know for certain how much these features are weighted.</p>



<p><strong>Other interesting findings. </strong>According to Google’s internal documents:</p>



<ul>
<li>Freshness matters – Google looks at dates in the byline (<strong>bylineDate</strong>), URL (<strong>syntacticDate</strong>) and on-page content (<strong>semanticDate</strong>).</li>



<li>To determine whether a document is or isn’t a core topic of the website, Google vectorizes pages and sites, then compares the page embeddings (<strong>siteRadius</strong>) to the site embeddings (<strong>siteFocusScore</strong>). </li>



<li>Google stores domain registration information (<strong>RegistrationInfo</strong>).</li>



<li>Page titles still matter. Google has a feature called <strong>titlematchScore</strong> that is believed to measure how well a page title matches a query. </li>



<li>Google measures the average weighted font size of terms in documents (<strong>avgTermWeight</strong>) and anchor text.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>The articles. </strong></p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://ipullrank.com/google-algo-leak" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Secrets from the Algorithm: Google Search’s Internal Engineering Documentation Has Leaked</a> by King on iPullRank</li>



<li><a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/an-anonymous-source-shared-thousands-of-leaked-google-search-api-documents-with-me-everyone-in-seo-should-see-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">An Anonymous Source Shared Thousands of Leaked Google Search API Documents with Me; Everyone in SEO Should See Them</a> by Fishkin on SparkToro</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Quick clarification. </strong>There is some dispute as to whether these documents were “leaked” or “discovered.” I’ve been told it’s likely the internal documents were accidentally included in a code review and pushed live from Google’s internal code base, where they were then discovered.</p>



<p><strong>The source.</strong> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/erfanazimi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Erfan Azimi</a>, CEO and director of SEO for digital marketing agency EA Eagle Digital, posted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEb8_rbfFVw">a video</a>, claiming responsibility for sharing the documents with Fishkin. Azimi is not employed by Google.</p>

            <pubDate>Wed, 29 May 2024 08:12:20 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/panglesd/slipshow">https://github.com/panglesd/slipshow</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40509638">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">slipshow</h2><a id="user-content-slipshow" aria-label="Permalink: slipshow" href="#slipshow"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Slipshow is a tool specifically designed for technical presentations where traditional slides are not enough.</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">In a slipshow presentation, the equivalent of a slide is called a <em>slip</em>. Each slip is like a slide, but with no bottom limit. That is, the content can be arbitrarily long! During the presentation, the camera will "scroll" down to reveal the hidden content, following a script given by the presenter!</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/panglesd/slipshow/blob/master/slip_scroll.gif"><img src="https://github.com/panglesd/slipshow/raw/master/slip_scroll.gif" alt="" data-animated-image=""></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Here are some properties of slipshow, in no specific orders:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Fix some of the issues with slides by bringing back features of a blackboard presentation: keep some content while erasing the rest!</li>
<li>Easy to write and readable syntax (markdown with few extensions). What you see is what you mean!</li>
<li>Open the possibility for a more dynamic presentation, with annotations and animations.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Slipshow compiles files written in an extension of markdown, to a standalone html file viewable offline in any web browser.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you want to see it in action, go to the <a href="#examples">example section</a>. If you want to start writing your presentation, go to <a href="#quick-start">Quick start</a>. Click for the <a href="#tutorial-api-documentation">full documentation and API</a>, or continue reading to know more about this project!</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">The issue with traditional slides</h2><a id="user-content-the-issue-with-traditional-slides" aria-label="Permalink: The issue with traditional slides" href="#the-issue-with-traditional-slides"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">When using traditional slides, you are given a rectangle of white space to express your thought. When this rectangle is full, you have no other choice than erasing everything, and start again with a new white rectangle.</p>
<p dir="auto">This can be a problem both for the viewer and the presenter. If the viewer took some time understanding the beginning of the slide, they might miss the last part of a slide: everything will be erased before they have a chance to read it and catch up. And indeed, there is an obvious asymetry: the last part of a slide will be visible much shorter than the first part!</p>
<p dir="auto">The presenter might want to show three information (<code>1</code>, <code>2</code> and <code>3</code>), each requiring the previous one to be visible on screen. However, all three information might not fit in one screen! When the first two are visible, it is necessary to... start again with a fresh slide, while we would like to keep information <code>2</code> visible.</p>
<p dir="auto">Of course, for many kind of presentation, with very few content in the slide, this is not a problem at all. However, for some of them, it can be quite an issue! Having had many courses on various technical subjects (mostly math and computer science), I can see how slides degraded the experience from a blackboard presentation.</p>
<p dir="auto">Instead of starting of with a fresh slide, a slipshow presentation "scrolls down" to reveal new space usable by the presenter, without hiding everything. This is much closer to what happens with a blackboard: the presenter can erase half of it, and continue with the new free space! And a viewer a little bit late still has a chance to catch up, since half of the information is still there.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Examples</h2><a id="user-content-examples" aria-label="Permalink: Examples" href="#examples"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">You can find several example of slip presentation, from different versions of slip. As they were from early stage of developpement, looking at the source code can be helpful but many things may have changed. Only the official example, tutorial and documentation are kept up to date.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="http://choum.net/panglesd/slides/slides-js/slides.html" rel="nofollow">The slips of my thesis</a>, the very first presentation that used (a very early version of) slipshow,</li>
<li><a href="https://choum.net/panglesd/slides/WDCM-2021-slips/wdcm-ada.html" rel="nofollow">Some other technical presentation</a> (that also used an early version of the engine)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Use the arrows to navigate in the presentation.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Tutorial, API and Documentation</h2><a id="user-content-tutorial-api-and-documentation" aria-label="Permalink: Tutorial, API and Documentation" href="#tutorial-api-and-documentation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">You can find an extensive documentation, with a tutorial at the readthedocs <a href="https://slipshow.readthedocs.io/" rel="nofollow">documentation</a>.</p>

<p dir="auto">For a super quick start, just click visit <a href="https://sliphub.choum.net/" rel="nofollow">sliphub.choum.net</a> to start writing a presentation online.</p>
<p dir="auto">For using slipshow offline, you'll need to install the slipshow tool. Currently, there are several ways to get it. The best is to download the precompiled binary from the <a href="https://github.com/panglesd/slipshow/releases/latest">latest release</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Slipshow is also package in some package manager:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="# For opam users. TODO: Update once it has been released to opam.
$ opam pin slipshow git@github.com/panglesd/slipshow.git

# For npm users
$ npm install -g slipshow"><pre><span><span>#</span> For opam users. TODO: Update once it has been released to opam.</span>
$ opam pin slipshow git@github.com/panglesd/slipshow.git

<span><span>#</span> For npm users</span>
$ npm install -g slipshow</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Then, you can use the <code>slipshow</code> binary to compile a <code>.md</code> file to a slipshow presentation:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="# Compile file.md into file.html:
$ slipshow -o file.html file.md

# Watch for changes in the file, automatically recompiling:
$ slipshow -o file.html file.md --watch

# Watch for changes in the file, automatically recompiling and hot-reloadind the opened presentation:
$ slipshow -o file.html file.md --serve"><pre><span><span>#</span> Compile file.md into file.html:</span>
$ slipshow -o file.html file.md

<span><span>#</span> Watch for changes in the file, automatically recompiling:</span>
$ slipshow -o file.html file.md --watch

<span><span>#</span> Watch for changes in the file, automatically recompiling and hot-reloadind the opened presentation:</span>
$ slipshow -o file.html file.md --serve</pre></div>

<section itemprop="articleBody" data-epic-field="content">
<p><b>Analysis: Organisations that impose return-to-office mandates face the catastrophic possibility of losing their most valuable workers</b></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.rte.ie/brainstorm/covid-19/">COVID-19</a> pandemic upended the workplace in many surprising ways. Many organisations were forced to abandon the traditional arrangement of having employees come to the office five days a week in favour of a variety of schemes for <a href="https://www.rte.ie/brainstorm/2024/0216/1408426-learning-on-the-job-remote-working/">remote work</a> or working from home.</p>
<p>Against all expectations, remote workers appear to <a href="https://thehill.com/business/4110598-remote-employees-work-longer-and-harder-studies-show/">work harder and more productively</a> than workers in traditional offices. Remote workers were not only more productive they were <a href="https://www.apollotechnical.com/statistics-on-remote-workers/">more satisfied</a> with remote work than they had been with working in a traditional office. This finding is not unexpected. Once you let workers do away with the commute to and from the office, office politics, <a href="https://www.rte.ie/brainstorm/2024/0410/1442669-workplace-bullying-harrassment-toxic-behaviour-bystanders/">workplace bullying</a>, boring meetings, the need to wear and take care of business suits and other costly and often uncomfortable attire, you should not be surprised that they will feel happier.</p>
<p>Since the end of the pandemic, there has been a growing push to encourage, and sometimes compel workers to <a href="https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2024/0115/1426497-survey-remote-working/">return to the office</a>. This movement has become so widespread that it has generated the acronym RTO, or Return to the Office. As I have noted in <a href="https://www.rte.ie/brainstorm/2023/0904/1402957-offices-workers-bosses-managers-executives-psychology/">earlier columns</a>, the rationale for RTO mandates is often murky, and it is hard to resist the conclusion that the push to get people back to the office is in part an effort to reduce the embarrassment of executives sitting in near-empty office buildings (building they often purchased or built) with <a href="https://www.rte.ie/brainstorm/2024/0319/1438645-middle-managers-job-role-organisations-workplace/">nobody to manage</a>.</p>

<p><i><b>From RTÉ Radio 1's The Business, Is your boss watching you?</b></i></p>
<p>There is increasing evidence that RTO mandates can be counterproductive. In particular, several organisations that have attempted to coerce workers back to the office have found that they are <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/05/12/rto-microsoft-apple-spacex">losing experienced managers</a> and top performers at disproportionate rates. The dynamic here is clear, and potentially alarming. Organisations that impose RTO mandates face the possibility of losing their most valuable workers. Turnover is often costly for organisations, but turnover of your most experienced and most valuable workers can be catastrophic.</p>
<p>I believe the pandemic shook things up in the world of work in ways that are still poorly understood. The great political philosopher Edmund Burke noted that "custom reconciles us to every thing", and I think this applies to all sorts of workplace norms and practices. If we were used to the way things were done in organisations, we were willing to put up with all sorts of organisational policies that were burdensome (e.g., dress codes) or even abusive (e.g., the expectation that we should work beyond normal working hours if asked to do this.)</p>

<p>A year or two away from the office has opened a lot of eyes, and things that were once widely accepted (e.g., office politics) are now barely tolerated, if they are accepted at all. More important, time away from the office seems to have upset the traditional balance of power between employers and employees. Once you realise that you do not need the office and that you do not need to be tightly monitored or supervised, it is hard to go back.</p>
<p>Some employees, of course, <i>do</i> go back. First, there are some employees who believe that being in the office will benefit their careers. They are probably right; workers who return to the office are more likely to <a href="https://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/ceos-data-agree-workers-promotion-office-4-days-week.html">receive promotions</a>.<i> </i>Whether organisations <i>should</i> promote the careerists who come back to the office in hopes that their loyalty (or submissiveness to RTO mandates) will win them promotions that their performance and effectiveness would not, is an open question. Second, there are employees who are <a href="https://www.rte.ie/brainstorm/2024/0304/1435778-bad-jobs-workplace-change-inertia-organisations/">trapped in their jobs</a>, either because of family or community obligations or because they lack the <a href="https://www.rte.ie/brainstorm/2024/0108/1411961-ireland-2024-upskilling-reskilling-training-courses-new-jobs-career-development/">skills, knowledge, and abilities</a> to move to other jobs. Executives who force RTO mandates down the throats of their employees run the risk of changing their organisation into a set of lapdog careerists and people who are stuck working for you, and it is hard to believe that this will benefit their organisation.</p>
<h2><b>Read more: <a href="https://www.rte.ie/brainstorm/2024/0115/1426555-coffee-badging-return-to-office-work-from-home-employers-employees/">Is 'coffee badging' the new return to office/work from home trend?</a></b></h2>
<p>Executives who are pushing employees to come back to the office are most likely to succeed if they can make a convincing case for <i>why </i>coming back to the office benefits employees and the organisation. The typical explanation that coming back to the office is important for the culture of the organisation is unfounded at best, and hogwash at worse. Second, the carrot works better than the stick. If you want employees to come back to the office, recognise that this comes at considerable costs to employees and give them incentives that more than offset these costs.</p>
<p>It is time for executives to recognise that the old power balance is unlikely to come back, and that mandates from on high that don't seem to make sense or that impose significant costs on employees will not be accepted by employees who have the skills, knowledge, experience, and abilities that give them ample opportunities to seek employment elsewhere. The RTO movement has, in the end, provided opportunities to executives who are smart enough and willing enough to read the new world of work to poach talent from their competitors. If this trend continues, we could see the old breed of all-powerful executives push themselves toward extinction. I can hardly wait!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On November 17th, 2023, OpenAI’s board shocked everyone by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/17/23965982/openai-ceo-sam-altman-fired">suddenly ousting</a> co-founder and CEO Sam Altman. </p><p>He had been overseeing one of the fastest-growing app launches in history with ChatGPT, so what happened? Former board member Helen Toner is filling in blank spaces in an interview on <a href="https://www.ted.com/podcasts/the-ted-ai-show"><em>The TED AI Show</em></a> podcast, providing her perspective on the events that caused board members to stop trusting Altman, as well as how he <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/8/24094885/openai-sam-altman-investigation-board-results">eventually returned</a>. </p><p>In her telling, once the board decided they needed to bring in a new CEO, they felt the only way to make it happen was to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/1/23984818/openai-microsoft-altman-nadella-firing-newyorker">go behind his back.</a> “[I]t was very clear to all of us that as soon as Sam had any inkling that we might do something that went against him, he would pull out all the stops, do everything in his power to undermine the board, to prevent us from even getting to the point of being able to fire him,” Toner said.</p><p>Toner says that one reason the board stopped trusting Altman was his failure to tell the board that he owned the OpenAI Startup Fund; another was how he gave inaccurate info about the company’s safety processes “on multiple occasions.” Additionally, Toner says she was personally targeted by the CEO after she published a research paper that angered him. “Sam started lying to other board members in order to try and push me off the board,” she says.</p><p>After two executives spoke directly to the board about their own experiences with Altman, describing a toxic atmosphere at OpenAI, accusing him of “psychological abuse,” and providing evidence of Altman “lying and being manipulative in different situations,” the board finally made its move.</p><p>Toner cites the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23488017/openai-chatbot-chatgpt-ai-examples-web-demo">launch of ChatGPT</a> itself as an example of how the board didn’t have real oversight over the company. “[W]hen ChatGPT came out November 2022, the board was not informed in advance. We learned about ChatGPT on Twitter,” says Toner.</p><div><p>The podcast doesn’t go into the details of what happened in the days following Altman’s firing. OpenAI rapidly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/20/23968848/openai-new-ceo-emmett-shear-twitch-co-founder-hiring">shuffled through</a> interim CEOs, employees <a href="https://twitter.com/ilyasut/status/1726590052392956028">including at least one of the board members who fired Altman</a> pushed for his return, and OpenAI’s lead investor, Microsoft, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/1/23984818/openai-microsoft-altman-nadella-firing-newyorker">put its support behind Altman</a>, too. </p></div><p>However, Toner points out three reasons she believes the pressure to restore Altman was so strong. She claims employees were presented with only two options about how things could go (ditching the board to restore Altman or seeing the company destroyed), and since people didn’t want the company to fall apart, they supported the other one. She also says many people were scared of going against Altman after watching him retaliate against others.</p><p>Her last reason is Altman’s track record prior to OpenAI:</p><div><blockquote><p>And I guess the last thing I would say about this is that this actually isn’t a new problem for Sam. And if you look at some of the reporting that that has come out since November. It’s come out that he was actually fired from his previous job at Y Combinator, which was hushed up at the time. And then at, you know, his job before that, which was his only other job in Silicon Valley, his startup Loopt, apparently the management team went to the board there twice and asked the board to fire him for what they called deceptive and chaotic behavior. If you actually look at his track record, he doesn’t exactly have a glowing trail of references. This wasn’t a problem specific to the personalities on the board, as much as he would love to portray it that way.&nbsp;</p></blockquote></div><p>The podcast also includes a response from current OpenAI board chair Bret Taylor:</p><div><blockquote><p>We are disappointed that Ms. Toner continues to revisit these issues. An independent committee of the board worked with the law firm Wilmer Hale, to conduct an extensive review of the events of November. The review concluded that the prior board’s decision was not based on concerns regarding product safety or security, the pace of development, OpenAI’s finances, or its statements to investors, customers, or business partners. Additionally, over 95 percent of employees, including senior leadership, asked for Sam’s reinstatement as CEO and the resignation of the prior board. Our focus remains on moving forward and pursuing OpenAI’s mission to ensure AGI benefits all of humanity.</p></blockquote></div></div></div>]]></description>

Another said there was no hesitation internally over spying on the prosecutor, adding: “With Bensouda, she’s black and African, so who cares?”</p><p>The surveillance system did not capture calls between ICC officials and anyone outside Palestine.

A former senior ICC official recalled: “We were made aware they were trying to get information on where we were with the preliminary examination.”</p><p>Officials also became aware of specific threats against a prominent Palestinian NGO, Al-Haq, which was one of several Palestinian human rights groups that frequently submitted information to the ICC inquiry, often in lengthy documents detailing incidents it wanted the prosecutor to consider.

<p>It’s an exciting time to build with large language models (LLMs). Over the past year, LLMs have become “good enough” for real-world applications. The pace of improvements in LLMs, coupled with a parade of demos on social media, will fuel an estimated $200B investment in AI by 2025. LLMs are also broadly accessible, allowing everyone, not just ML engineers and scientists, to build intelligence into their products. While the barrier to entry for building AI products has been lowered, creating those effective beyond a demo remains a deceptively difficult endeavor.</p>



<p>We’ve identified some crucial, yet often neglected, lessons and methodologies informed by machine learning that are essential for developing products based on LLMs. Awareness of these concepts can give you a competitive advantage against most others in the field without requiring ML expertise! Over the past year, the six of us have been building real-world applications on top of LLMs. We realized that there was a need to distill these lessons in one place for the benefit of the community.</p>



<p>We come from a variety of backgrounds and serve in different roles, but we’ve all experienced firsthand the challenges that come with using this new technology. Two of us are independent consultants who’ve helped numerous clients take LLM projects from initial concept to successful product, seeing the patterns determining success or failure. One of us is a researcher studying how ML/AI teams work and how to improve their workflows. Two of us are leaders on applied AI teams: one at a tech giant and one at a startup. Finally, one of us has taught deep learning to thousands and now works on making AI tooling and infrastructure easier to use. Despite our different experiences, we were struck by the consistent themes in the lessons we’ve learned, and we’re surprised that these insights aren’t more widely discussed.</p>



<p>Our goal is to make this a practical guide to building successful products around LLMs, drawing from our own experiences and pointing to examples from around the industry. We’ve spent the past year getting our hands dirty and gaining valuable lessons, often the hard way. While we don’t claim to speak for the entire industry, here we share some advice and lessons for anyone building products with LLMs.</p>



<p>This work is organized into three sections: tactical, operational, and strategic. This is the first of three pieces. It dives into the tactical nuts and bolts of working with LLMs. We share best practices and common pitfalls around prompting, setting up retrieval-augmented generation, applying flow engineering, and evaluation and monitoring. Whether you’re a practitioner building with LLMs or a hacker working on weekend projects, this section was written for you. Look out for the operational and strategic sections in the coming weeks.</p>



<p>Ready to <s>dive</s> delve in? Let’s go.</p>



<h2><strong>Tactical</strong></h2>



<p>In this section, we share best practices for the core components of the emerging LLM stack: prompting tips to improve quality and reliability, evaluation strategies to assess output, retrieval-augmented generation ideas to improve grounding, and more. We also explore how to design human-in-the-loop workflows. While the technology is still rapidly developing, we hope these lessons, the by-product of countless experiments we’ve collectively run, will stand the test of time and help you build and ship robust LLM applications.</p>



<h3><strong>Prompting</strong></h3>



<p>We recommend starting with prompting when developing new applications. It’s easy to both underestimate <em>and</em> overestimate its importance. It’s underestimated because the right prompting techniques, when used correctly, can get us very far. It’s overestimated because even prompt-based applications require significant engineering around the prompt to work well.</p>



<h4><strong>Focus on getting the most out of fundamental prompting techniques</strong></h4>



<p>A few prompting techniques have consistently helped improve performance across various models and tasks: n-shot prompts + in-context learning, chain-of-thought, and providing relevant resources.</p>



<p>The idea of in-context learning via n-shot prompts is to provide the LLM with a few examples that demonstrate the task and align outputs to our expectations. A few tips: </p>



<ul><li>If n is too low, the model may over-anchor on those specific examples, hurting its ability to generalize. As a rule of thumb, aim for n ≥ 5. Don’t be afraid to go as high as a few dozen.</li><li>Examples should be representative of the expected input distribution. If you’re building a movie summarizer, include samples from different genres in roughly the proportion you expect to see in practice.</li><li>You don’t necessarily need to provide the full input-output pairs. In many cases, examples of desired outputs are sufficient.</li><li>If you are using an LLM that supports tool use, your n-shot examples should also use the tools you want the agent to use.</li></ul>



<p>In chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, we encourage the LLM to explain its thought process before returning the final answer. Think of it as providing the LLM with a sketchpad so it doesn’t have to do it all in memory. The original approach was to simply add the phrase “Let’s think step-by-step” as part of the instructions. However, we’ve found it helpful to make the CoT more specific, where adding specificity via an extra sentence or two often reduces hallucination rates significantly. For example, when asking an LLM to summarize a meeting transcript, we can be explicit about the steps, such as:</p>



<ul><li>First, list the key decisions, follow-up items, and associated owners in a sketchpad.</li><li>Then, check that the details in the sketchpad are factually consistent with the transcript.</li><li>Finally, synthesize the key points into a concise summary.</li></ul>



<p>Recently, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04776" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">some doubt</a> has been cast on whether this technique is as powerful as believed. Additionally, there’s significant debate about exactly what happens during inference when chain-of-thought is used. Regardless, this technique is one to experiment with when possible.</p>



<p>Providing relevant resources is a powerful mechanism to expand the model’s knowledge base, reduce hallucinations, and increase the user’s trust. Often accomplished via retrieval augmented generation (RAG), providing the model with snippets of text that it can directly utilize in its response is an essential technique. When providing the relevant resources, it’s not enough to merely include them; don’t forget to tell the model to prioritize their use, refer to them directly, and sometimes to mention when none of the resources are sufficient. These help “ground” agent responses to a corpus of resources. </p>



<h4><strong>Structure your inputs and outputs</strong></h4>



<p>Structured input and output help models better understand the input as well as return output that can reliably integrate with downstream systems. Adding serialization formatting to your inputs can help provide more clues to the model as to the relationships between tokens in the context, additional metadata to specific tokens (like types), or relate the request to similar examples in the model’s training data. </p>



<p>As an example, many questions on the internet about writing SQL begin by specifying the SQL schema. Thus, you may expect that effective prompting for Text-to-SQL should include structured schema definitions; <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/371223615_SQL-PaLM_Improved_Large_Language_ModelAdaptation_for_Text-to-SQL" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="indeed (opens in a new tab)">indeed</a>.</p>



<p>Structured output serves a similar purpose, but it also simplifies integration into downstream components of your system. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Instructor (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/jxnl/instructor" target="_blank">Instructor</a> and <a href="https://github.com/outlines-dev/outlines" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Outlines</a> work well for structured output. (If you’re importing an LLM API SDK, use Instructor; if you’re importing Huggingface for a self-hosted model, use Outlines.) Structured input expresses tasks clearly and resembles how the training data is formatted, increasing the probability of better output.</p>



<p>When using structured input, be aware that each LLM family has their own preferences. Claude prefers <code>xml</code> while GPT favors Markdown and JSON. With XML, you can even pre-fill Claude’s responses by providing a <code>response</code> tag like so.</p>



<pre>                                                     <code>&lt;/&gt; python

   }

<h4><strong>Have small prompts that do one thing, and only one thing, well</strong></h4>



<p>A common anti-pattern/code smell in software is the “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="God Object (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_object" target="_blank">God Object</a>,” where we have a single class or function that does everything. The same applies to prompts too.</p>



<p>A prompt typically starts simple: A few sentences of instruction, a couple of examples, and we’re good to go. But as we try to improve performance and handle more edge cases, complexity creeps in. More instructions. Multi-step reasoning. Dozens of examples. Before we know it, our initially simple prompt is now a 2,000 token frankenstein. And to add injury to insult, it has worse performance on the more common and straightforward inputs!

<p>Just like how we strive (read: struggle) to keep our systems and code simple, so should we for our prompts. Instead of having a single, catch-all prompt for the meeting transcript summarizer, we can break it into steps to:</p>



<ul><li>Extract key decisions, action items, and owners into structured format</li><li>Check extracted details against the original transcription for consistency</li><li>Generate a concise summary from the structured details</li></ul>



<p>As a result, we’ve split our single prompt into multiple prompts that are each simple, focused, and easy to understand. And by breaking them up, we can now iterate and eval each prompt individually.</p>



<h4><strong>Craft your context tokens</strong></h4>



<p>Rethink, and challenge your assumptions about how much context you actually need to send to the agent. Be like Michaelangelo, do not build up your context sculpture—chisel away the superfluous material until the sculpture is revealed. RAG is a popular way to collate all of the potentially relevant blocks of marble, but what are you doing to extract what’s necessary?</p>



<p>We’ve found that taking the final prompt sent to the model—with all of the context construction, and meta-prompting, and RAG results—putting it on a blank page and just reading it, really helps you rethink your context. We have found redundancy, self-contradictory language, and poor formatting using this method. </p>



<p>The other key optimization is the structure of your context. Your bag-of-docs representation isn’t helpful for humans, don’t assume it’s any good for agents. Think carefully about how you structure your context to underscore the relationships between parts of it, and make extraction as simple as possible.</p>



<h3><strong>Information Retrieval/RAG</strong></h3>



<p>Beyond prompting, another effective way to steer an LLM is by providing knowledge as part of the prompt. This grounds the LLM on the provided context which is then used for in-context learning. This is known as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Practitioners have found RAG effective at providing knowledge and improving output, while requiring far less effort and cost compared to finetuning.RAG is only as good as the retrieved documents’ relevance, density, and detail</p>



<h4><strong>The quality of your RAG’s output is dependent on the quality of retrieved documents, which in turn can be considered along a few factors.</strong></h4>



<p>The first and most obvious metric is relevance. This is typically quantified via ranking metrics such as <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_reciprocal_rank" target="_blank">Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discounted_cumulative_gain" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) (opens in a new tab)">Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)</a>. MRR evaluates how well a system places the first relevant result in a ranked list while NDCG considers the relevance of all the results and their positions. They measure how good the system is at ranking relevant documents higher and irrelevant documents lower. For example, if we’re retrieving user summaries to generate movie review summaries, we’ll want to rank reviews for the specific movie higher while excluding reviews for other movies.</p>



<p>Like traditional recommendation systems, the rank of retrieved items will have a significant impact on how the LLM performs on downstream tasks. To measure the impact, run a RAG-based task but with the retrieved items shuffled—how does the RAG output perform?</p>



<p>Second, we also want to consider information density. If two documents are equally relevant, we should prefer one that’s more concise and has lesser extraneous details. Returning to our movie example, we might consider the movie transcript and all user reviews to be relevant in a broad sense. Nonetheless, the top-rated reviews and editorial reviews will likely be more dense in information.</p>



<p>Finally, consider the level of detail provided in the document. Imagine we’re building a RAG system to generate SQL queries from natural language. We could simply provide table schemas with column names as context. But, what if we include column descriptions and some representative values? The additional detail could help the LLM better understand the semantics of the table and thus generate more correct SQL.</p>



<h4><strong>Don’t forget keyword search; use it as a baseline and in hybrid search.</strong></h4>



<p>Given how prevalent the embedding-based RAG demo is, it’s easy to forget or overlook the decades of research and solutions in information retrieval.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, while embeddings are undoubtedly a powerful tool, they are not the be all and end all. First, while they excel at capturing high-level semantic similarity, they may struggle with more specific, keyword-based queries, like when users search for names (e.g., Ilya), acronyms (e.g., RAG), or IDs (e.g., claude-3-sonnet). Keyword-based search, such as BM25, are explicitly designed for this. And after years of keyword-based search, users have likely taken it for granted and may get frustrated if the document they expect to retrieve isn’t being returned. </p>



<blockquote><p>Vector embeddings <em>do not</em> magically solve search. In fact, the heavy lifting is in the step before you re-rank with semantic similarity search. Making a genuine improvement over BM25 or full-text search is hard. </p><cite>— <a href="https://x.com/AravSrinivas/status/1737886080555446552" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Aravind Srinivas, CEO Perplexity.ai</a></cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>We’ve been communicating this to our customers and partners for months now. Nearest Neighbor Search with naive embeddings yields very noisy results and you’re likely better off starting with a keyword-based approach.</p><cite>— <a href="https://twitter.com/beyang/status/1767330006999720318" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Beyang Liu, CTO Sourcegraph</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>Second, it’s more straightforward to understand why a document was retrieved with keyword search—we can look at the keywords that match the query. In contrast, embedding-based retrieval is less interpretable. Finally, thanks to systems like Lucene and OpenSearch that have been optimized and battle-tested over decades, keyword search is usually more computationally efficient.</p>



<p>In most cases, a hybrid will work best: keyword matching for the obvious matches, and embeddings for synonyms, hypernyms, and spelling errors, as well as multimodality (e.g., images and text). <a href="https://www.shortwave.com/blog/deep-dive-into-worlds-smartest-email-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Shortwave shared how they built their RAG pipeline (opens in a new tab)">Shortwave shared how they built their RAG pipeline</a>, including query rewriting, keyword + embedding retrieval, and ranking.</p>



<h4><strong>Prefer RAG over fine-tuning for new knowledge</strong></h4>



<p>Both RAG and fine-tuning can be used to incorporate new information into LLMs and increase performance on specific tasks. Thus, which should we try first?</p>



<p>Recent research suggests that RAG may have an edge. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="One study (opens in a new tab)" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05934" target="_blank">One study</a> compared RAG against unsupervised fine-tuning (a.k.a. continued pre-training), evaluating both on a subset of MMLU and current events. They found that RAG consistently outperformed fine-tuning for knowledge encountered during training as well as entirely new knowledge. In <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="another paper (opens in a new tab)" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08406" target="_blank">another paper</a>, they compared RAG against supervised fine-tuning on an agricultural dataset. Similarly, the performance boost from RAG was greater than fine-tuning, especially for GPT-4 (see Table 20 of the paper).</p>



<p>Beyond improved performance, RAG comes with several practical advantages too. First, compared to continuous pretraining or fine-tuning, it’s easier—and cheaper!—to keep retrieval indices up-to-date. Second, if our retrieval indices have problematic documents that contain toxic or biased content, we can easily drop or modify the offending documents.</p>



<p>In addition, the R in RAG provides finer grained control over how we retrieve documents. For example, if we’re hosting a RAG system for multiple organizations, by partitioning the retrieval indices, we can ensure that each organization can only retrieve documents from their own index. This ensures that we don’t inadvertently expose information from one organization to another.</p>



<h4><strong>Long-context models won’t make RAG obsolete</strong></h4>



<p>With Gemini 1.5 providing context windows of up to 10M tokens in size, some have begun to question the future of RAG. </p>



<blockquote><p>I tend to believe that Gemini 1.5 is significantly overhyped by Sora. A context window of 10M tokens effectively makes most of existing RAG frameworks unnecessary—you simply put whatever your data into the context and talk to the model like usual. Imagine how it does to all the startups/agents/LangChain projects where most of the engineering efforts goes to RAG 😅 Or in one sentence: the 10m context kills RAG. Nice work Gemini.</p><cite>— <a href="https://x.com/Francis_YAO_/status/1758935954189115714" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Yao Fu</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>While it’s true that long contexts will be a game-changer for use cases such as analyzing multiple documents or chatting with PDFs, the rumors of RAG’s demise are greatly exaggerated.</p>



<p>First, even with a context window of 10M tokens, we’d still need a way to select information to feed into the model. Second, beyond the narrow needle-in-a-haystack eval, we’ve yet to see convincing data that models can effectively reason over such a large context. Thus, without good retrieval (and ranking), we risk overwhelming the model with distractors, or may even fill the context window with completely irrelevant information.</p>



<p>Finally, there’s cost. The Transformer’s inference cost scales quadratically (or linearly in both space and time) with context length. Just because there exists a model that could read your organization’s entire Google Drive contents before answering each question doesn’t mean that’s a good idea. Consider an analogy to how we use RAM: we still read and write from disk, even though there exist compute instances with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/high-memory/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="RAM running into the tens of terabytes (opens in a new tab)">RAM running into the tens of terabytes</a>.</p>



<p>So don’t throw your RAGs in the trash just yet. This pattern will remain useful even as context windows grow in size.</p>



<h3><strong>Tuning and optimizing workflows</strong></h3>



<p>Prompting an LLM is just the beginning. To get the most juice out of them, we need to think beyond a single prompt and embrace workflows. For example, how could we split a single complex task into multiple simpler tasks? When is finetuning or caching helpful with increasing performance and reducing latency/cost? In this section, we share proven strategies and real-world examples to help you optimize and build reliable LLM workflows.</p>



<h4><strong>Step-by-step, multi-turn “flows” can give large boosts.</strong></h4>



<p>We already know that by decomposing a single big prompt into multiple smaller prompts, we can achieve better results. An example of this is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08500" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="AlphaCodium (opens in a new tab)">AlphaCodium</a>: By switching from a single prompt to a multi-step workflow, they increased GPT-4 accuracy (pass@5) on CodeContests from 19% to 44%. The workflow includes:</p>



<ul><li>Reflecting on the problem</li><li>Reasoning on the public tests</li><li>Generating possible solutions</li><li>Ranking possible solutions</li><li>Generating synthetic tests</li><li>Iterating on the solutions on public and synthetic tests.</li></ul>



<p>Small tasks with clear objectives make for the best agent or flow prompts. It’s not required that every agent prompt requests structured output, but structured outputs help a lot to interface with whatever system is orchestrating the agent’s interactions with the environment.</p>



<p>Some things to try</p>



<ul><li>An explicit planning step, as tightly specified as possible. Consider having predefined plans to choose from (c.f. https://youtu.be/hGXhFa3gzBs?si=gNEGYzux6TuB1del).</li><li>Rewriting the original user prompts into agent prompts. Be careful, this process is lossy!</li><li>Agent behaviors as linear chains, DAGs, and State-Machines; different dependency and logic relationships can be more and less appropriate for different scales. Can you squeeze performance optimization out of different task architectures?</li><li>Planning validations; your planning can include instructions on how to evaluate the responses from other agents to make sure the final assembly works well together.</li><li>Prompt engineering with fixed upstream state—make sure your agent prompts are evaluated against a collection of variants of what may happen before.</li></ul>



<h4><strong>Prioritize deterministic workflows for now</strong></h4>



<p>While AI agents can dynamically react to user requests and the environment, their non-deterministic nature makes them a challenge to deploy. Each step an agent takes has a chance of failing, and the chances of recovering from the error are poor. Thus, the likelihood that an agent completes a multi-step task successfully decreases exponentially as the number of steps increases. As a result, teams building agents find it difficult to deploy reliable agents.</p>



<p>A promising approach is to have agent systems that produce deterministic plans which are then executed in a structured, reproducible way. In the first step, given a high-level goal or prompt, the agent generates a plan. Then, the plan is executed deterministically. This allows each step to be more predictable and reliable. Benefits include:</p>



<ul><li>Generated plans can serve as few-shot samples to prompt or finetune an agent.</li><li>Deterministic execution makes the system more reliable, and thus easier to test and debug. Furthermore, failures can be traced to the specific steps in the plan.</li><li>Generated plans can be represented as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) which are easier, relative to a static prompt, to understand and adapt to new situations.</li></ul>



<p>The most successful agent builders may be those with strong experience managing junior engineers because the process of generating plans is similar to how we instruct and manage juniors. We give juniors clear goals and concrete plans, instead of vague open-ended directions, and we should do the same for our agents too. </p>



<p>In the end, the key to reliable, working agents will likely be found in adopting more structured, deterministic approaches, as well as collecting data to refine prompts and finetune models. Without this, we’ll build agents that may work exceptionally well some of the time, but on average, disappoint users which leads to poor retention.</p>



<h4><strong>Getting more diverse outputs beyond temperature</strong></h4>



<p>Suppose your task requires diversity in an LLM’s output. Maybe you’re writing an LLM pipeline to suggest products to buy from your catalog given a list of products the user bought previously. When running your prompt multiple times, you might notice that the resulting recommendations are too similar—so you might increase the temperature parameter in your LLM requests.</p>



<p>Briefly, increasing the temperature parameter makes LLM responses more varied. At sampling time, the probability distributions of the next token become flatter, meaning that tokens which are usually less likely get chosen more often. Still, when increasing temperature, you may notice some failure modes related to output diversity. For example,Some products from the catalog that could be a good fit may never be output by the LLM.The same handful of products might be overrepresented in outputs, if they are highly likely to follow the prompt based on what the LLM has learned at training time.If the temperature is too high, you may get outputs that reference nonexistent products (or gibberish!)</p>



<p>In other words, increasing temperature does not guarantee that the LLM will sample outputs from the probability distribution you expect (e.g., uniform random). Nonetheless, we have other tricks to increase output diversity. The simplest way is to adjust elements within the prompt. For example, if the prompt template includes a list of items, such as historical purchases, shuffling the order of these items each time they’re inserted into the prompt can make a significant difference. </p>



<p>Additionally, keeping a short list of recent outputs can help prevent redundancy. In our recommended products example, by instructing the LLM to avoid suggesting items from this recent list, or by rejecting and resampling outputs that are similar to recent suggestions, we can further diversify the responses. Another effective strategy is to vary the phrasing used in the prompts. For instance, incorporating phrases like “pick an item that the user would love using regularly” or “select a product that the user would likely recommend to friends” can shift the focus and thereby influence the variety of recommended products.</p>



<h4><strong>Caching is underrated.</strong></h4>



<p>Caching saves cost and eliminates generation latency by removing the need to recompute responses for the same input. Furthermore, if a response has previously been guardrailed, we can serve these vetted responses and reduce the risk of serving harmful or inappropriate content.</p>



<p>One straightforward approach to caching is to use unique IDs for the items being processed, such as if we’re summarizing new articles or <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/12/amazon-is-using-generative-ai-to-summarize-product-reviews.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="product reviews (opens in a new tab)">product reviews</a>. When a request comes in, we can check to see if a summary already exists in the cache. If so, we can return it immediately; if not, we generate, guardrail, and serve it, and then store it in the cache for future requests.</p>



<p>For more open-ended queries, we can borrow techniques from the field of search, which also leverages caching for open-ended inputs. Features like autocomplete and spelling correction also help normalize user input and thus increase the cache hit rate.</p>



<h4><strong>When to fine-tune</strong></h4>



<p>We may have some tasks where even the most cleverly designed prompts fall short. For example, even after significant prompt engineering, our system may still be a ways from returning reliable, high-quality output. If so, then it may be necessary to finetune a model for your specific task. </p>



<p>Successful examples include:</p>



<ul><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Honeycomb's Natural Language Query Assistant (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/introducing-query-assistant" target="_blank">Honeycomb’s Natural Language Query Assistant</a>: Initially, the “programming manual” was provided in the prompt together with n-shot examples for in-context learning. While this worked decently, fine-tuning the model led to better output on the syntax and rules of the domain-specific language.</li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_DMMlDuJB0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="ReChat's Lucy (opens in a new tab)">ReChat’s Lucy</a>: The LLM needed to generate responses in a very specific format that combined structured and unstructured data for the frontend to render correctly. Fine-tuning was essential to get it to work consistently.</li></ul>



<p>Nonetheless, while fine-tuning can be effective, it comes with significant costs. We have to annotate fine-tuning data, finetune and evaluate models, and eventually self-host them. Thus, consider if the higher upfront cost is worth it. If prompting gets you 90% of the way there, then fine-tuning may not be worth the investment. However, if we do decide to fine-tune, to reduce the cost of collecting human annotated data, we can <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="generate and finetune on synthetic data (opens in a new tab)" href="https://eugeneyan.com/writing/synthetic/" target="_blank">generate and finetune on synthetic data</a>, or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="bootstrap on open-source data (opens in a new tab)" href="https://eugeneyan.com/writing/finetuning/" target="_blank">bootstrap on open-source data</a>.</p>



<h3><strong> Evaluation &amp; Monitoring</strong></h3>



<p>Evaluating LLMs can be a minefield. The inputs and the outputs of LLMs are arbitrary text, and the tasks we set them to are varied. Nonetheless, rigorous and thoughtful evals are critical—it’s no coincidence that technical leaders at OpenAI <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="work on evaluation and give feedback on individual evals (opens in a new tab)" href="https://twitter.com/eugeneyan/status/1701692908074873036" target="_blank">work on evaluation and give feedback on individual evals</a>. </p>



<p>Evaluating LLM applications invites a diversity of definitions and reductions: it’s simply unit testing, or it’s more like observability, or maybe it’s just data science. We have found all of these perspectives useful. In the following section, we provide some lessons we’ve learned about what is important in building evals and monitoring pipelines.</p>



<h4><strong>Create a few assertion-based unit tests from real input/output samples</strong></h4>



<p>Create <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="unit tests (i.e., assertions) (opens in a new tab)" href="https://hamel.dev/blog/posts/evals/#level-1-unit-tests" target="_blank">unit tests (i.e., assertions)</a> consisting of samples of inputs and outputs from production, with expectations for outputs based on at least three criteria. While three criteria might seem arbitrary, it’s a practical number to start with; fewer might indicate that your task isn’t sufficiently defined or is too open-ended, like a general-purpose chatbot. These unit tests, or assertions, should be triggered by any changes to the pipeline, whether it’s editing a prompt, adding new context via RAG, or other modifications. This <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="write-up has an example (opens in a new tab)" href="https://hamel.dev/blog/posts/evals/#step-1-write-scoped-tests" target="_blank">write-up has an example</a> of an assertion-based test for an actual use case.</p>



<p>Consider beginning with assertions that specify phrases or ideas to either include or exclude in all responses. Also consider checks to ensure that word, item, or sentence counts lie within a range. For other kinds of generation, assertions can look different. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Execution-evaluation (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Execution-Based-Evaluation-for-Open-Domain-Code-Wang-Zhou/1bed34f2c23b97fd18de359cf62cd92b3ba612c3" target="_blank">Execution-evaluation</a> is a powerful method for evaluating code-generation, wherein you run the generated code and determine that the state of runtime is sufficient for the user-request. </p>



<p>As an example, if the user asks for a new function named foo; then after executing the agent’s generated code, foo should be callable! One challenge in execution-evaluation is that the agent code frequently leaves the runtime in slightly different form than the target code. It can be effective to “relax” assertions to the absolute most weak assumptions that any viable answer would satisfy.</p>



<p>Finally, using your product as intended for customers (i.e., “dogfooding”) can provide insight into failure modes on real-world data. This approach not only helps identify potential weaknesses, but also provides a useful source of production samples that can be converted into evals.</p>



<h4><strong>LLM-as-Judge can work (somewhat), but it’s not a silver bullet</strong></h4>



<p>LLM-as-Judge, where we use a strong LLM to evaluate the output of other LLMs, has been met with skepticism by some. (Some of us were initially huge skeptics.) Nonetheless, when implemented well, LLM-as-Judge achieves decent correlation with human judgements, and can at least help build priors about how a new prompt or technique may perform. Specifically, when doing pairwise comparisons (e.g., control vs. treatment), LLM-as-Judge typically gets the direction right though the magnitude of the win/loss may be noisy.</p>



<p>Here are some suggestions to get the most out of LLM-as-Judge:</p>



<ul><li>Use pairwise comparisons: Instead of asking the LLM to score a single output on a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Likert (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale" target="_blank">Likert</a> scale, present it with two options and ask it to select the better one. This tends to lead to more stable results.</li><li>Control for position bias: The order of options presented can bias the LLM’s decision. To mitigate this, do each pairwise comparison twice, swapping the order of pairs each time. Just be sure to attribute wins to the right option after swapping!</li><li>Allow for ties: In some cases, both options may be equally good. Thus, allow the LLM to declare a tie so it doesn’t have to arbitrarily pick a winner.</li><li>Use Chain-of-Thought: Asking the LLM to explain its decision before giving a final preference can increase eval reliability. As a bonus, this allows you to use a weaker but faster LLM and still achieve similar results. Because frequently this part of the pipeline is in batch mode, the extra latency from CoT isn’t a problem.</li><li>Control for response length: LLMs tend to bias toward longer responses. To mitigate this, ensure response pairs are similar in length.</li></ul>



<p>One particularly powerful application of LLM-as-Judge is checking a new prompting strategy against regression. If you have tracked a collection of production results, sometimes you can rerun those production examples with a new prompting strategy, and use LLM-as-Judge to quickly assess where the new strategy may suffer.</p>



<p>Here’s an example of a <a href="https://hamel.dev/blog/posts/evals/#automated-evaluation-w-llms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">simple but effective approach</a> to iterate on LLM-as-Judge, where we simply log the LLM response, judge’s critique (i.e., CoT), and final outcome. They are then reviewed with stakeholders to identify areas for improvement. Over three iterations, agreement with human and LLM improved from 68% to 94%!</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/Picture1.png" alt="" width="800" height="229"></figure>



<p>LLM-as-Judge is not a silver bullet though. There are subtle aspects of language where even the strongest models fail to evaluate reliably. In addition, we’ve found that <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="conventional classifiers (opens in a new tab)" href="https://eugeneyan.com/writing/finetuning/" target="_blank">conventional classifiers</a> and reward models can achieve higher accuracy than LLM-as-Judge, and with lower cost and latency. For code generation, LLM-as-Judge can be weaker than more direct evaluation strategies like execution-evaluation.</p>



<h4><strong>The “intern test” for evaluating generations</strong></h4>



<p>We like to use the following “intern test” when evaluating generations: If you took the exact input to the language model, including the context, and gave it to an average college student in the relevant major as a task, could they succeed? How long would it take?</p>



<p>If the answer is no because the LLM lacks the required knowledge, consider ways to enrich the context.</p>



<p>If the answer is no and we simply can’t improve the context to fix it, then we may have hit a task that’s too hard for contemporary LLMs.</p>



<p>If the answer is yes, but it would take a while, we can try to reduce the complexity of the task. Is it decomposable? Are there aspects of the task that can be made more templatized?</p>



<p>If the answer is yes, they would get it quickly, then it’s time to dig into the data. What’s the model doing wrong? Can we find a pattern of failures? Try asking the model to explain itself before or after it responds, to help you build a theory of mind. </p>



<h4><strong>Overemphasizing certain evals can hurt overall performance</strong></h4>



<blockquote><p>“When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.” </p><cite>— Goodhart’s Law</cite></blockquote>



<p>An example of this is the Needle-in-a-Haystack (NIAH) eval. The original eval helped quantify model recall as context sizes grew, as well as how recall is affected by needle position. However, it’s been so overemphasized that it’s featured as <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Figure 1 for Gemini 1.5's report (opens in a new tab)" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05530" target="_blank">Figure 1 for Gemini 1.5’s report</a>. The eval involves inserting a specific phrase (“The special magic {city} number is: {number}”) into a long document which repeats the essays of Paul Graham, and then prompting the model to recall the magic number.</p>



<p>While some models achieve near-perfect recall, it’s questionable whether NIAH truly reflects the reasoning and recall abilities needed in real-world applications. Consider a more practical scenario: Given the transcript of an hour-long meeting, can the LLM summarize the key decisions and next steps, as well as correctly attribute each item to the relevant person? This task is more realistic, going beyond rote memorization and also considering the ability to parse complex discussions, identify relevant information, and synthesize summaries.</p>



<p>Here’s an example of a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="practical NIAH eval (opens in a new tab)" href="https://observablehq.com/@shreyashankar/needle-in-the-real-world-experiments" target="_blank">practical NIAH eval</a>. Using <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="transcripts of doctor-patient video calls (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/wyim/aci-bench/tree/main/data/challenge_data" target="_blank">transcripts of doctor-patient video calls</a>, the LLM is queried about the patient’s medication. It also includes a more challenging NIAH, inserting a phrase for random ingredients for pizza toppings, such as “<em>The secret ingredients needed to build the perfect pizza are: Espresso-soaked dates, Lemon and Goat cheese.</em>” Recall was around 80% on the medication task and 30% on the pizza task.</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/Picture2.png" alt=""></figure>



<p>Tangentially, an overemphasis on NIAH evals can lead to lower performance on extraction and summarization tasks. Because these LLMs are so finetuned to attend to every sentence, they may start to treat irrelevant details and distractors as important, thus including them in the final output (when they shouldn’t!)</p>



<p>This could also apply to other evals and use cases. For example, summarization. An emphasis on factual consistency could lead to summaries that are less specific (and thus less likely to be factually inconsistent) and possibly less relevant. Conversely, an emphasis on writing style and eloquence could lead to more flowery, marketing-type language that could introduce factual inconsistencies.</p>



<h4><strong>Simplify annotation to binary tasks or pairwise comparisons</strong></h4>



<p>Providing open-ended feedback or ratings for model output on a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Likert scale (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale" target="_blank">Likert scale</a> is cognitively demanding. As a result, the data collected is more noisy—due to variability among human raters—and thus less useful. A more effective approach is to simplify the task and reduce the cognitive burden on annotators. Two tasks that work well are binary classifications and pairwise comparisons.</p>



<p>In binary classifications, annotators are asked to make a simple yes-or-no judgment on the model’s output. They might be asked whether the generated summary is factually consistent with the source document, or whether the proposed response is relevant, or if it contains toxicity. Compared to the Likert scale, binary decisions are more precise, have higher consistency among raters, and lead to higher throughput. This was how <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Doordash setup their labeling queues (opens in a new tab)" href="https://doordash.engineering/2020/08/28/overcome-the-cold-start-problem-in-menu-item-tagging/" target="_blank">Doordash setup their labeling queues</a> for tagging menu items though a tree of yes-no questions.</p>



<p>In pairwise comparisons, the annotator is presented with a pair of model responses and asked which is better. Because it’s easier for humans to say “A is better than B” than to assign an individual score to either A or B individually, this leads to faster and more reliable annotations (over Likert scales). At a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Llama2 meetup (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzR3OrOkM9w" target="_blank">Llama2 meetup</a>, Thomas Scialom, an author on the Llama2 paper, confirmed that pairwise-comparisons were faster and cheaper than collecting supervised finetuning data such as written responses. The former’s cost is $3.5 per unit while the latter’s cost is $25 per unit.</p>



<p>If you’re starting to write labeling guidelines, here are some <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="reference guidelines (opens in a new tab)" href="https://eugeneyan.com/writing/labeling-guidelines/" target="_blank">reference guidelines</a> from Google and Bing Search.</p>



<h4><strong>(Reference-free) evals and guardrails can be used interchangeably </strong></h4>



<p>Guardrails help to catch inappropriate or harmful content while evals help to measure the quality and accuracy of the model’s output. In the case of reference-free evals, they may be considered two sides of the same coin. Reference-free evals are evaluations that don’t rely on a “golden” reference, such as a human-written answer, and can assess the quality of output based solely on the input prompt and the model’s response.</p>



<p>Some examples of these are <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="summarization evals (opens in a new tab)" href="https://eugeneyan.com/writing/evals/#summarization-consistency-relevance-length" target="_blank">summarization evals</a>, where we only have to consider the input document to evaluate the summary on factual consistency and relevance. If the summary scores poorly on these metrics, we can choose not to display it to the user, effectively using the eval as a guardrail. Similarly, reference-free <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="translation evals (opens in a new tab)" href="https://eugeneyan.com/writing/evals/#translation-statistical--learned-evals-for-quality" target="_blank">translation evals</a> can assess the quality of a translation without needing a human-translated reference, again allowing us to use it as a guardrail.</p>



<h4><strong>LLMs will return output even when they shouldn’t</strong></h4>



<p>A key challenge when working with LLMs is that they’ll often generate output even when they shouldn’t. This can lead to harmless but nonsensical responses, or more egregious defects like toxicity or dangerous content. For example, when asked to extract specific attributes or metadata from a document, an LLM may confidently return values even when those values don’t actually exist. Alternatively, the model may respond in a language other than English because we provided non-English documents in the context.</p>



<p>While we can try to prompt the LLM to return a “not applicable” or “unknown” response, it’s not foolproof. Even when the log probabilities are available, they’re a poor indicator of output quality. While log probs indicate the likelihood of a token appearing in the output, they don’t necessarily reflect the correctness of the generated text. On the contrary, for instruction-tuned models that are trained to respond to queries and generate coherent response, log probabilities may not be well-calibrated. Thus, while a high log probability may indicate that the output is fluent and coherent, it doesn’t mean it’s accurate or relevant.</p>



<p>While careful prompt engineering can help to some extent, we should complement it with robust guardrails that detect and filter/regenerate undesired output. For example, OpenAI provides a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="content moderation API (opens in a new tab)" href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation" target="_blank">content moderation API</a> that can identify unsafe responses such as hate speech, self-harm, or sexual output. Similarly, there are numerous packages for <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="detecting personally identifiable information (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/topics/pii-detection" target="_blank">detecting personally identifiable information</a> (PII). One benefit is that guardrails are largely agnostic of the use case and can thus be applied broadly to all output in a given language. In addition, with precise retrieval, our system can deterministically respond “I don’t know” if there are no relevant documents.</p>



<p>A corollary here is that LLMs may fail to produce outputs when they are expected to. This can happen for various reasons, from straightforward issues like long tail latencies from API providers to more complex ones such as outputs being blocked by content moderation filters. As such, it’s important to consistently log inputs and (potentially a lack of) outputs for debugging and monitoring.</p>



<h4><strong>Hallucinations are a stubborn problem.</strong></h4>



<p>Unlike content safety or PII defects which have a lot of attention and thus seldom occur, factual inconsistencies are stubbornly persistent and more challenging to detect. They’re more common and occur at a baseline rate of 5 – 10%, and from what we’ve learned from LLM providers, it can be challenging to get it below 2%, even on simple tasks such as summarization.</p>



<p>To address this, we can combine prompt engineering (upstream of generation) and factual inconsistency guardrails (downstream of generation). For prompt engineering, techniques like CoT help reduce hallucination by getting the LLM to explain its reasoning before finally returning the output. Then, we can apply a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="factual inconsistency guardrail (opens in a new tab)" href="https://eugeneyan.com/writing/finetuning/" target="_blank">factual inconsistency guardrail</a> to assess the factuality of summaries and filter or regenerate hallucinations. In some cases, hallucinations can be deterministically detected. When using resources from RAG retrieval, if the output is structured and identifies what the resources are, you should be able to manually verify they’re sourced from the input context.</p>

<p>Noise-canceling headphones have gotten very good at creating an auditory blank slate. But allowing certain sounds from a wearer’s environment through the erasure still challenges researchers. The latest edition of Apple’s AirPods Pro, for instance, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/18/airpods-pro-usb-c-hands-on-adaptive-audio-and-conversation-awareness.html">automatically adjusts sound levels</a> for wearers — sensing when they’re in conversation, for instance — but the user has little control over whom to listen to or when this happens.</p>
<p>A University of Washington team has developed an artificial intelligence system that lets a user wearing headphones look at a person speaking for three to five seconds to “enroll” them. The system, called “Target Speech Hearing,” then cancels all other sounds in the environment and plays just the enrolled speaker’s voice in real time even as the listener moves around in noisy places and no longer faces the speaker.</p>
<p>The team presented <a href="https://programs.sigchi.org/chi/2024/program/content/147319">its findings</a> May 14 in Honolulu at the ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems. The <a href="https://github.com/vb000/LookOnceToHear">code for the proof-of-concept device</a> is available for others to build on. The system is not commercially available.</p>
<p>“We tend to think of AI now as web-based chatbots that answer questions,” said senior author <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~gshyam/">Shyam Gollakota</a>, a UW professor in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science &amp; Engineering. “But in this project, we develop AI to modify the auditory perception of anyone wearing headphones, given their preferences. With our devices you can now hear a single speaker clearly even if you are in a noisy environment with lots of other people talking.”</p>
<p>To use the system, a person wearing off-the-shelf headphones fitted with microphones taps a button while directing their head at someone talking. The sound waves from that speaker’s voice then should reach the microphones on both sides of the headset simultaneously; there’s a 16-degree margin of error. The headphones send that signal to an on-board embedded<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-board_computer"> computer</a>, where the team’s machine learning software learns the desired speaker’s vocal patterns. The system latches onto that speaker’s voice and continues to play it back to the listener, even as the pair moves around. The system’s ability to focus on the enrolled voice improves as the speaker keeps talking, giving the system more training data.</p>

<p>The team tested its system on 21 subjects, who rated the clarity of the enrolled speaker’s voice nearly twice as high as the unfiltered audio on average.</p>
<p>This work builds on the <a href="https://www.washington.edu/news/2023/11/09/ai-noise-canceling-headphones/">team’s previous “semantic hearing” research</a>, which allowed users to select specific sound classes — such as birds or voices — that they wanted to hear and canceled other sounds in the environment.</p>
<p>Currently the TSH system can enroll only one speaker at a time, and it’s only able to enroll a speaker when there is not another loud voice coming from the same direction as the target speaker’s voice. If a user isn’t happy with the sound quality, they can run another enrollment on the speaker to improve the clarity.</p>
<p>The team is working to expand the system to earbuds and hearing aids in the future.</p>

<p dir="auto">ChatTTS is a text-to-speech model designed specifically for dialogue scenario such as LLM assistant. It supports both English and Chinese languages. Our model is trained with 100,000+ hours composed of chinese and english. The open-source version on HuggingFace is a 40,000 hours pre trained model without SFT.</p>
<p dir="auto">For formal inquiries about model and roadmap, please contact us at <a href="mailto:open-source@2noise.com">open-source@2noise.com</a>. You could join our QQ group: 808364215 for discussion. Adding github issues is always welcomed.</p>

<ol dir="auto">
<li><strong>Conversational TTS</strong>: ChatTTS is optimized for dialogue-based tasks, enabling natural and expressive speech synthesis. It supports multiple speakers, facilitating interactive conversations.</li>
<li><strong>Fine-grained Control</strong>: The model could predict and control fine-grained prosodic features, including laughter, pauses, and interjections.</li>
<li><strong>Better Prosody</strong>: ChatTTS surpasses most of open-source TTS models in terms of prosody. We provide pretrained models to support further research and development.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">For the detailed description of the model, you can refer to <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1zn4y1o7iV" rel="nofollow">video on Bilibili</a></p>

<p dir="auto">ChatTTS is a powerful text-to-speech system. However, it is very important to utilize this technology responsibly and ethically. To limit the use of ChatTTS, we added a small amount of high-frequency noise during the training of the 40,000-hour model, and compressed the audio quality as much as possible using MP3 format, to prevent malicious actors from potentially using it for criminal purposes. At the same time, we have internally trained a detection model and plan to open-source it in the future.</p>

<p dir="auto">For a 30-second audio clip, at least 4GB of GPU memory is required. For the 4090D GPU, it can generate audio corresponding to approximately 7 semantic tokens per second. The Real-Time Factor (RTF) is around 0.65.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content-blocks"><p id="intersections"><h2>Intersections</h2></p><p> Steve Jobs famously laid out his offices to facilitate employees bumping into each other. “When Steve Jobs designed a new headquarters for Pixar,” <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141007161621-73685339-why-steve-jobs-obsessed-about-office-design-and-yes-bathroom-locations/?utm_source=www.zaxis.page&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=productivity-versus-alignment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">wrote his biographer</a> Walter Isaacson, “he obsessed over ways to structure the atrium, and even where to locate the bathrooms, so that serendipitous personal encounters would occur.” The thinking was that the more he could get people to interact (particularly people from different teams), the more likely it was that they’d think outside the box and innovate. </p><p> Many others have adopted this philosophy. And while the strategy certainly might lead to a bit more ideation, I would argue, the increased alignment between disparate teams likely had a negative impact on <i>productive</i> innovation. </p><p> In my experience, no matter where you work, things are less productive than you’d want, and there’s less alignment than you’d hope for. </p><p> Why does this happen? </p><p> As individuals become stakeholders to a project, the number of communication channels between them rises exponentially. Doing anything company-wide becomes tremendously difficult. </p><p> Take a mid-sized tech company introducing a new feature. Product managers need buy in from all the other product managers who own their own respective surfaces. These each need to talk to the designers. The engineers weigh in on what’s feasible. The inability to do certain things causes a new flood of re-definition by the product managers and the designers and the engineers once more. Throw into the mix the lawyers, the accountants, the quality assurance testers, the finance team, and so on. Is it surprising things take so long to get done? </p><p><img alt="" src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/8169ce9f-6107-4073-9555-5dc3cfe5d4ab/connections.png?t=1712672100"></p><p> Having so many communication channels both decreases everyone’s productivity and discourages innovation. That’s because there’s too much organizational overhead to allow things to move quickly, and there’s too much organizational overhead to allow new ideas to get off the ground in the first place. </p><p id="the-impact-of-relationships"><h2>The Impact of Relationships</h2></p><p> The introduction of any new node into a communication system raises the number of stakeholder relationships exponentially. If you only have two stakeholders, there is one relationship. Introduce a third stakeholder, and you’re up to three relationships. In a team of 50? Now you have 1,225 relationships to consider between all of your employees. </p><p> The formula that governs this is: </p><p><img alt="" src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/3994d070-ff8b-48cd-a1f9-909e091b9a31/image.png?t=1712606934"></p><p> Of course, if you had 50 employees and didn’t have any of them talk to one another, or forced them to only communicate with a small number of colleagues, you’d run into other problems. The dissemination of information is key. The incorporation of stakeholder inputs into product development is key. All of these things <i>necessitate</i> that people talk to one another. Leave the legal team out of a new feature exploration, and you may find out too late what you want to do isn’t accounted for in your terms of service. Forget to call the accounting team, and they may later discover the negative margin impact of your idea. </p><p> And so we’ve reached an impasse. On the one hand, we want to reduce the number of communication channels to avoid “too many cooks in the kitchen.” On the other hand, we want to have enough communication channels so that all relevant stakeholders can weigh in. </p><p id="the-slippery-slope"><h2>The Slippery Slope</h2></p><p> We can graph what’s happening here. On one axis, productivity. On the other, alignment. The more your team members or sub-organizations need to be in sync, the less quickly they will execute their goals (because of the overhead of communicating). Conversely, the more you want to focus on productivity, efficiency, new feature creation, etc., the less your teams will be able to keep up with each other. </p><p><img alt="" src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/2268c6de-85cb-4edc-97ed-dca2236690fe/alignprod.png?t=1714658595"></p><p> I’ve drawn a similar graph before in this newsletter. Several months ago, I wrote about the concept of <a href="https://www.zaxis.page/p/push-pull-building-products" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">The Push and Pull of Building Products</a>, suggesting that there was a similar mathematical trade-off between focusing on the needs of your existing customers and focusing on the needs of the new ones. </p><p><img alt="" src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/3a24fbde-e18e-4928-b0b9-afa02a493dbd/customers2.png?t=1714658947"></p><p> In both graphs, a company is positioned somewhere along this curve. And that’s the case whether they choose their position or not. So they might as well choose their position. </p><p> In the Steve Jobs anecdote, there seems to be an explicit decision to be placed in the upper left hand corner of the first graph: </p><p><img alt="" src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/ce11c9e6-cc01-4720-9e01-cc89df2e674e/apple.png?t=1714659308"></p><p> And this shouldn’t be surprising. Apple is notorious for unmatched internal alignment amongst its teams, a feat necessary to achieve such clean and integrated user experiences. Consider, for instance, how many different functions the three buttons on the sides of your iPhone serve depending on the context. Consider the thousands of employees at Apple that had to coordinate the who/what/where/when/why of such a limited interface across such a diverse set of user requirements. </p><p> And now consider how many years it must have taken those thousands of employees to reach alignment and consensus. </p><p id="optimization"><h2>Choosing Your Place</h2></p><p> I’m not sure there is a right answer to the productivity/alignment trade-off, nor that there ever could be. But I do believe that, as with all trade-offs, the only thing worse than either option (or anything in between) is not being active in choosing which you want. Being passive allows the winds of randomness or fate to govern where you land, and nobody wins. </p><p> It’s worth repeating: The trade-off of productivity and alignment happens whether or not a company explicitly chooses the relative balance. So they might as well choose it. </p><p> I’m brought back to my own startup days, when we explicitly made the decision to iterate quickly at all costs. Granted, our team wasn’t Apple-sized, but even at the small scale of 20 or 25 individuals, misalignment was plentiful and frustrating. But at least it was a weakness we’d deliberately chosen. </p><p><img alt="" src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/399de2b4-c541-414d-8605-0c7e3ddefb93/startup.png?t=1716840682"></p><p> I’ve explored before how, for an early stage startup, it is <a href="https://www.zaxis.page/p/things-that-dont-scale" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">critical to iterate quickly</a> because of the <a href="https://www.zaxis.page/p/90-percent-wrong" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">likelihood of errors</a> in your convictions. There is a great parallel to computer programming concepts here, which I’ll save for a later article. </p><p> Suffice it to say that when a company chooses to have a meeting between stakeholders, it better be sure it knows why. And when a company chooses to <i>cancel</i> a meeting between stakeholders, it better be sure it knows why. </p><p> Final word today goes to writer Dave Barry, who once said this quote I encourage us all to remember: </p><div><p>If you had to identify, in one word, the reason why the human race has not achieved, and never will achieve, its full potential, that word would be: <i>Meetings</i>.</p></div><p id="whats-next"><h2>What’s Next?</h2></p><p> If you enjoyed this article, consider subscribing to this newsletter to get articles like this in your inbox every week for free: </p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/28/24166177/google-search-ranking-algorithm-leak-documents-link-seo">https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/28/24166177/google-search-ranking-algorithm-leak-documents-link-seo</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40505310">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Google’s search algorithm is perhaps the most consequential system on the internet, dictating <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/2/24147152/google-search-seo-publishing-housefresh-product-reviews">what sites live and die</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/23998379/google-search-seo-algorithm-webpage-optimization">what content on the web looks like</a>. But how exactly Google ranks websites has long been a mystery, pieced together by journalists, researchers, and people working in search engine optimization.</p><p>Now, an explosive leak that purports to show <a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/an-anonymous-source-shared-thousands-of-leaked-google-search-api-documents-with-me-everyone-in-seo-should-see-them/">thousands of pages of internal documents</a> appears to offer an unprecedented look under the hood of how Search works — and suggests that Google hasn’t been entirely truthful about it for years. So far, Google hasn’t responded to multiple requests for comment on the legitimacy of the documents.</p><p>Rand Fishkin, who worked in SEO for more than a decade, says a source shared 2,500 pages of documents with him with the hopes that reporting on the leak would counter the “lies” that Google employees had shared about how the search algorithm works. The documents outline Google’s search API and break down what information is available to employees, according to Fishkin.</p><p>The details shared by Fishkin are dense and technical, likely more legible to developers and SEO experts than the layperson. The contents of the leak are also not necessarily proof that Google uses the specific data and signals it mentions for search rankings. Rather, the leak outlines what data Google collects from webpages, sites, and searchers and offers indirect hints to SEO experts about what Google seems to care about, as SEO expert Mike King <a href="https://ipullrank.com/google-algo-leak">wrote</a> in his overview of the documents.</p><p>The leaked documents touch on topics like what kind of data Google collects and uses, which sites Google elevates for sensitive topics like elections, how Google handles small websites, and more. Some information in the documents appears to be in conflict with public statements by Google representatives, according to Fishkin and King. </p><p>“‘Lied’ is harsh, but it’s the only accurate word to use here,” King writes. “While I don’t necessarily fault Google’s public representatives for protecting their proprietary information, I do take issue with their efforts to actively discredit people in the marketing, tech, and journalism worlds who have presented reproducible discoveries.”</p><p>Google has not responded to <em>The Verge’</em>s requests for comment<em> </em>regarding the documents, including a direct request to refute their legitimacy. Fishkin told <em>The Verge </em>in an email that the company has not disputed the veracity of the leak, but that an employee asked him to change some language in the post regarding how an event was characterized.</p><p>Google’s secretive search algorithm has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/features/23931789/seo-search-engine-optimization-experts-google-results">birthed an entire industry</a> of marketers who closely follow Google’s public guidance and execute it for millions of companies around the world. The pervasive, often annoying tactics have led to a general narrative that Google Search results are getting worse, crowded with junk that website operators <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23753963/google-seo-shopify-small-business-ai">feel required to produce</a> to have their sites seen. In response to <em>The Verge</em>’s past reporting on the SEO-driven tactics, Google representatives often fall back to a familiar defense: that’s not what the <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/seo-starter-guide">Google guidelines</a> say. </p><p>But some details in the leaked documents call into question the accuracy of Google’s public statements regarding how Search works. </p><p>One example cited by Fishkin and King is whether Google Chrome data is used in ranking at all. Google representatives have <a href="https://www.seroundtable.com/google-chrome-search-usage-15618.html">repeatedly</a> <a href="https://iloveseo.com/seo/google-does-not-use-anything-from-google-chrome-for-ranking/">indicated</a> that it doesn’t use Chrome data to rank pages, but Chrome is <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/google_api_content_warehouse/0.4.0/GoogleApi.ContentWarehouse.V1.Model.QualitySitemapTargetGroup.html#module-attributes">specifically mentioned in sections</a> about how websites appear in Search. In the screenshot below, which I captured as an example, the links appearing below the main vogue.com URL may be created in part using Chrome data, according to the documents.</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="A Google Search screenshot of the Vogue.com result, with sublinks below the main homepage.

Google representatives have <a href="https://x.com/searchliaison/status/1755283334631231514">previously said E-E-A-T isn’t a ranking factor</a>.

A portion of the documents shared by King reads that the field was “mainly developed and tuned for news articles... but is also populated for other content (e.g., scientific articles).” Though this doesn’t confirm that bylines are an explicit ranking metric, it does show that Google is at least keeping track of this attribute. Google representatives have <a href="https://x.com/searchliaison/status/1744379351297081637">previously insisted</a> that author bylines are something website owners should do for readers, not Google, because it doesn’t impact rankings.</p><p>Though the documents aren’t exactly a smoking gun, they provide a deep, unfiltered look at a tightly guarded black box system. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23869483/us-v-google-search-antitrust-case-updates">US government’s antitrust case against Google</a> — which revolves around Search — has also led to internal documentation becoming public, offering further insights into how the company’s main product works. </p><p>Google’s general caginess on how Search works has led to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/23998379/google-search-seo-algorithm-webpage-optimization">websites looking the same</a> as SEO marketers try to outsmart Google based on hints the company offers. Fishkin also calls out the publications credulously propping up Google’s public claims as truth without much further analysis.</p><p>“Historically, some of the search industry’s loudest voices and most prolific publishers have been happy to uncritically repeat Google’s public statements. They write headlines like ‘Google says XYZ is true,’ rather than ‘Google Claims XYZ; Evidence Suggests Otherwise,’” Fishkin writes. “Please, do better. If this leak and the DOJ trial can create just one change, I hope this is it.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

We present a prototype of a programming system called Shadama.
Shadama is designed for writing programs that create, control and visualize large numbers of objects.
The basic execution model follows the tradition of StarLogo and its "turtles and patches" abstraction.

</span>
&nbsp; This abstraction has been proven to be effective and easy to use.
The primary goal of the language is to facilitate the writing of scientific simulations by students
at the high school level.
        </p>

        <p>
The Shadama environment supports <i>liveness</i>.
Once changes to the program are saved, the effect on the running simulation is immediate;
there is no need to restart the simulation.
        </p>
        <p>
Shadama programs are run on the GPU by means of code translation to the OpenGL Shading Language.

Program data resides entirely on the GPU, which enables high performance.
        </p>

        <p>
A prototype of Shadama can be found <a href="http://tinlizzie.org/~ohshima/shadama2">here</a>.
Be aware that Shadama requires WebGL 2 and is affected by the floating point precision provided
by your graphics card. Thus, it only works on certain computer systems.
From our experience, it seems to work better on computers with an AMD Radeon graphics
card and on Chrome or Firefox browsers.
</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
The computing power available to us today is astounding.  Achieving
one teraflop of performance was a milestone for a building-sized supercomputer in
the late '90s, but now we expect smart phones to reach this same milestone soon.
Computing performance will only continue to increase in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
But what are people using this power for?  Not to be critical, but
people are generally more interested in watching cat videos and
playing games than trying to invent self-piloting personal airplanes
or discover the graviton.

All joking aside, one of the big problems we face today is our
struggle to advance science literacy, even within a
technologically-advanced society.  We need the next
generation to embrace science more, not less.
        </p>
        <p>
We think now is a good time to redouble our efforts to provide
environments where students and even professional
programmers can more easily tap into the computing power that is available.
To this end, we have been working on a prototype of a
programming language intended for high school students to explore
scientific concepts.
        </p>
        <p>
  Science is about making the invisible visible.  One notable example
of an invisible yet important concept is molecules in a gas.  We would
like students to learn about this, not by rote memorization, but
through actual experiments and model-building.  With the help of
computers, students can make a dynamic model and understand it more
deeply.  This kind of environment will help students construct
knowledge by doing, in line with the constructivism philosophy of
education.
        </p>
</section>

<section>
        <h2 id="a-science-experiment">A Science Experiment</h2>
        <p>
Before introducing the Shadama programming environment, we first
give an example of a physics experiment that could also be modeled
and simulated on a computer.
</p>
<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/07D0nB3mgLA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p>
This movie demonstrates a vacuum cannon.  The cannon is a six foot PVC
pipe connected to a vacuum pump.  We put a ping pong ball inside the pipe,
cover the ends with sturdy but breakable material (such as plastic plates),
and pump the air out.
        </p>
        <p>
The pump reduces the pressure inside the tube to about 20% of full atmospheric pressure.
        </p>
        <p>
When the end near the ping pong ball is broken open by a box cutter, the
air molecules that rush into the pipe move into the
low pressure space and the ping pong ball is pushed out the other end.
Our crude setup can accelerate the ball to a speed of over 200 meters per second
(about 60% of the speed of sound).  Others have built similar setups
that can achieve supersonic speed.
        </p>
        <p>
An interesting point to understand is that it is just movement of
molecules that is causing the ball to shoot out. It is not that the
vacuum is sucking molecules into the pipe.
</p>
<p>
The invisible molecules that cause the ball to shoot out can
be made “visible” in a sense not only through this physical experiment,
but also through a computer simulation that reproduces the same phenomenon.
Creating such simulations is the purpose of our programming environment.
          </p>
</section>

<section>
        <h2 id="language-goals">Language Goals</h2>

<p>
We had the following goals when designing Shadama:
</p><ul>
<li> Easy to learn</li>
<li> Openness</li>
<li> Support for large numbers of particles</li>
<li> Liveness</li>
</ul>


<p>
To make learning Shadama easy, we based our language on StarLogo,
whose turtles and patches approach has proved intuitive to young learners.
In addition, we expect students familiar with Scratch to
learn Shadama easily because of similarites in how object behavior
is programmed and how objects can sense values near them spatially.
</p>

<p>
To encourage openness, we designed Shadama to be capable of implementing
complex behavior in the language itself, with as few primitives as possible.
We think that a learning environment should be open
in the sense that a student should be able to see, change and understand
how the various parts of the system work.
Although many sophisticated scientific software packages and simulation environments
exist, they are presented as immutable black boxes,
which limits understanding and stifles curiousity.
When additional software support is required, it should be provided in the
end-user's programming language, and it should be capable of modification
within the end-user's environment.
</p>

<p>
To support large numbers of particles, we designed the language
to execute on graphics hardware. Graphics processors today
are capable of computing on massive amounts of data.
Unfortunately, this requires a trade-off between ease of use and
high performance because there are fundamental limitations in
the execution model of today's graphics hardware.
Although Shadama has some features to mitigate these limitations,
certain behaviors cannot be implemented.
</p>

<p>
To support liveness, we designed the Shadama environment to show
the effects of code changes immediately. Of course,
a running simulation should not be updated for each and every key stroke.
Instead, the user submits a batch of code changes for the environment
to apply.
</p>

Our code translator is written in Ohm

and generates vertex shader, fragment shader and JavaScript code from the Shadama program.
All the values for a given breed and property are stored in a single OpenGL texture.
These textures are created with the OpenGL type "R32F", to match
their use as an array of floating-point scalar values.
The values for a given patch and property are similarly represented.
</p>
<p>
Shadama static functions are translated to Javascript code that
runs OpenGL shaders derived from the Shadama methods.
For each method, a vertex shader is generated to fetch property values
from textures and perform the computation required for that method.
A generated fragment shader stores the property values back
into textures, using the multiple render targets feature of OpenGL.

The biggest inspiration for Shadama (and Kedama) was Resnick's StarLogo.

This is a reflection of their focus on empowering scientific researchers.

        <h2 id="conclusions-and-future-work">Conclusions and Future Work</h2>
        <p>
We have presented an early prototype of a language in
which users can make enlightening simulations and intricate visualizations.
The liveliness of the environment encourages an
exploratory style of programming that enables trying out different ideas quickly.
We have also discovered that such an interactive and graphical environment
can be motivating even as bugs appear because of the spectacular
unintentional visual effects that are produced.
        </p>
        <p>
We are considering various improvements to the system.  One major
addition would be to fully support simulations in 3D, not just 2D.
While computation in Shadama only uses scalar values and is agnostic to dimensionality,
the primitives and concepts the system currently provides only work well for 2D applications.
We will need new ideas to manage 3D spatial data.
        </p>
        <p>
We also plan to support more mathematical concepts, such as vectors and matrices.
While first-time users may not initially have use for such abstractions,
we would like them to eventually learn and use these powerful concepts.
Ideally, the environment would gradually introduce the user to new, more difficult approaches.
        </p>
        <p>
We would like to conclude this paper by stressing the importance of
education. Education raises our awareness and enables us to see our world from new perspectives.
In this way, we are empowered with new approaches to solve problems.
For the next generation to solve the challenges of the future, their science literacy
is imperative. Our aim with Shadama is to leverage the power and ubiquity of
computing devices to improve science literacy for high school students by providing an engaging, open
environment in which to explore scientific concepts.

        <h2 id="language">Appendix: A Primer for the Shadama Language</h2>

<p>
The Shadama language uses a turtles and patches abstraction, drawn from the tradition of StarLogo.
</p>

        <h3 id="breeds">Breeds</h3>
<p>
Turtles are organized into
"breeds".  Each breed has its own set of properties.
A breed is declared in a program with the "breed" statement.  For example:
</p>
<pre>breed MyBreed (x, y)
</pre>
<p>
The above creates a breed of turtle called <code>MyBreed</code>, and declares that each
turtle in the breed has individual properties <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>.
</p>
<p>
Currently, properties in Shadama can only be scalar floating-point numbers.
</p>
<p>
Methods provide turtle behavior. The <code>def</code> statement is used to define
methods, as follows:
</p>
<pre>def move() {
  this.x = this.x + 1;
  this.y = this.y + 1;
}
</pre>
<p>
As expected, when this method is invoked on a turtle, the
turtle's x and y properties are incremented by one.
</p>
<p>
Methods can only be invoked from static functions. Methods calls are made
by first specifying a breed, then the method name.
The method is applied to all turtles in the breed concurrently.
For example:
</p>
<pre>static step() {
  MyBreed.move();
}
</pre>
<p>
The <code>step</code> function above calls the <code>move</code> method on all turtles of the <code>MyBreed</code> breed.
</p>

<p>
Shadama provides many built-in features made available through primitive methods:
</p>
<ul>

<li> <pre>aBreed.setCount(count);</pre>
  <span>
  The <code>setCount</code> primitive sets the number of turtles in the breed.
For example:
</span>
<pre>static setup() {
  MyBreed.setCount(10000);
}
</pre>
<span>
Invoking this static function will set the number of <code>MyBreed</code> turtles to 10,000.
In the current implementation, the number of turtles in a breed is limited to
1024 × 1024, or about 1 million.
</span>
</li>

<li> <pre>aBreed.fillRandom(name, min, max);</pre>
<span>
  The <code>fillRandom</code> primitive sets the property specified by <code>name</code>
  to be a random number between <code>min</code>
  (inclusive) and <code>max</code> (exclusive) for each turtle in the breed.
  For example:
</span>
<pre>static setup() {
  MyBreed.setCount(10000);
  MyBreed.fillRandom("x", 0, 100);
}
</pre>
<span>
  The above will set each of the 10,000 turtles <code>x</code> property to be a
  random floating-point number between 0 and 100.
</span>
</li>

<li> <pre>aBreed.fillRandomDir(dxName, dyName);</pre>
<span>
  The <code>fillRandomDir</code> primitive generates random 2D unit vectors.
  This is done for each turtle, and the x and y components of the result are stored
  in the <code>dxName</code> and <code>dyName</code> properties of the turtles.
  For example:
</span>
<pre>static setup() {
  MyBreed.setCount(10000);
  MyBreed.fillRandomDir("dx", "dy");
}
</pre>
<span>
The above sets the <code>dx</code> and <code>dy</code> properties of the turtles with the x and y components of the randomly generated unit vectors.
</span>
</li>

<li> <pre>aBreed.fillSpace(xName, yName, xDim, yDim);</pre>
        <span>
The fillSpace primitive first sets the number of turtles in the breed
to be <code>xDim</code> × <code>yDim</code>.  Then, it places the turtles on integral 2D grid points
within the (0..<code>xDim</code>, 0..<code>yDim</code>) area, storing into the <code>xName</code> and <code>yName</code> turtle properties.
For example:
</span>
<pre>static setup() {
  MyBreed.fillSpace("x", "y", 100, 100);
}
</pre>
<span>
The above creates 10,000 turtles of the MyBreed breed, setting the turtle's <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> properties
to be the integral grid points spanning (0, 0) to (99, 99), inclusive.
</span>
</li>

<li> <pre>aBreed.fillImage(xName, yName, rName, gName, bName, aName, anImageData);</pre>
        <span>
  The fillImage primitive converts a 2D image into a breed of turtles.
  The <code>anImageData</code> argument is a Javascript ImageData object containing the data used
  to populate the breed. The turtle count is set to be <code>anImageData.width</code> × <code>anImageData.height</code>.
  Similar to <code>fillSpace</code>, the turtles are placed on the 2D grid points within the image extent.
  The turtle properties given by <code>rName</code>, <code>gName</code>, <code>bName</code>, and <code>aName</code> are populated with the RGBA
  color component values of the image. Note that while the color components in <code>anImageData</code> range
  from 0 and 255 (integral values), those values in Shadama will be normalized to range from 0.0 and 1.0,
  inclusive (floating-point).
  For example:
<pre>breed MyBreed (x, y, r, g, b, a)
static setup() {
  MyBreed.fillImage("x", "y", "r", "g", "b", "a", anImage);
}
</pre>
</span>
<span>
Static function variables, such as <code>anImage</code>, are described below.
</span>
</li></ul>

<h3 id="patches">Patches</h3>

<p>
A patch is a 2D set of cells that store values.
Patches are fixed size, 512 × 512 by default.
The following declares a patch:
</p><pre>patch Field (nx, ny)
</pre>

<p>
Each cell in this patch stores two values, <code>nx</code> and <code>ny</code>.
</p>

<p>
A patch can be manipulated by passing it as an argument to a method on a breed.
As the method is executed for each turtle, turtles can access the patch cell
nearest them. No other patch cells are available to them.
For example:
</p><pre>breed MyBreed (x, y, r, g, b, a)
patch Field (r, g, b, a)

def store(field) {
  field.r = this.r;
}

static setup() {
  MyBreed.fillImage("x", "y", "r", "g", "b", "a", anImage);
  MyBreed.store(Field);
}
</pre>

<p>
The above declares a patch called Field which is used as an argument to <code>store</code>.
When <code>store</code> is executed for each turtle in <code>MyBreed</code>, the turtle's <code>r</code> property
is stored in the <code>r</code> property of the nearest cell in Field.
</p>

<p>
A turtle can read values from patch cells as well.  For example:
</p><pre>def load(field) {
   this.r = field.r;
}
</pre>

<p>
When the above method is executed, each turtle reads the <code>r</code> property of the nearest patch cell
and stores the value into its own <code>r</code> property.
</p>
<p>
Methods can receive multiple patches as arguments.
For example:
</p><pre>patch Field1 (nx, ny, r, g, b, a)
patch Field2 (nx, ny, r, g, b, a)
def transfer(f1, f2) {
  f2.r = f1.r;
  f2.a = f1.a;
}
</pre>

<p>
The following code is also valid, and correctly swaps values between patches.
</p><pre>def swap(f1, f2) {
  f2.r = f1.r;
  f1.r = f2.r
}
</pre>


<h3 id="local-variables">Local Variables</h3>

<p>
The <code>var</code> statement declares a local variable within a method.
The scope of a local variables is the whole method,
regardless of where in the method it is declared.
In the same method, there can be no more than one declaration for a given variable name.
This is in contrast to variable declarations in JavaScript.
For example:
</p><pre>def average() {
  var avg = (this.x + this.y) / 2.0;
  this.x = avg;
  this.y = avg;
}
</pre>
<p>
The above code properly defines and uses a local variable called <code>avg</code>.
However, the following code would raise an error because the variable <code>diff</code> is declared in two places:
</p><pre>def gcd() {
  if (this.a &gt; this.b) {
    var diff = this.a - this.b;
    this.a = diff;
  } else {
    var diff = this.b - this.a;
    this.b = diff;
  }
</pre>

<p>
The variable declaration has to be manually hoisted, as follows:
</p><pre>def gcd() {
  var diff;
  if (this.a &gt; this.b) {
    diff = this.a - this.b;
    this.a = diff;
  } else {
    diff = this.b - this.a;
    this.b = diff;
  }
</pre>


<h3 id="static-function-variables">Static Function Variables</h3>

<p>
Static function variables are declared within static functions, also using the "var" statement.
Static function variables are not available to methods, but are visible to all static functions.
For example:
</p><pre>static setup() {
  var begin = 1;
}

static loop() {
  if (begin) {
    begin = 0;
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
The two static functions above refer to the same <code>begin</code> variable.
</p>

<p>
Shadama provides the following built-in static function variables:
</p><ul>
  <li>
    <code>mousemove</code>:
    An object whose <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> properties refer to the most recent mouse cursor location.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>mousedown</code>:
    An object whose <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> properties refer to the most
    recent location where the user pressed the mouse button down.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>mouseup</code>:
    An object whose <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> properties refer to the most
    recent location where the user lifted the mouse button up.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>time</code>:
    The number of seconds elapsed since the last time the <code>setup</code> function was called (in floating-point).
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>width, height</code>:
    The width and height of the Shadama canvas.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Be aware that mouse event objects are JavaScript objects. Thus, they can't be passed to methods because
methods can only take scalar arguments.
</p>

<p>
There is one additional variable called <code>Display</code>
for invoking certain system primitives.

For example:
</p><pre>static loop() {
  Display.clear();
  MyPatch.draw();
}
</pre>
<p>
The above code clears the canvas and then draws <code>MyPatch</code> by calling the <code>draw</code> primitive.  <code>Display</code> has <code>loadProgram</code>, and <code>clear</code>.
</p>

<h3 id="parallelism-considerations">Parallelism Considerations</h3>
<p>
It's possible for two or more nearby turtles to write into the same patch cell.
Which value gets stored in the patch is non-deterministic.
</p>
<p>
Also, updates to turtle properties and patch properties are not visible until after the method is run.
Consider the following method:
</p><pre>def test() {
  if (this.r &gt; 0) {
     this.r = 0;
  } else {
     this.r = 1;
  }
  this.b = this.r;
}
</pre>

<p>
Even though the last line reads <code>this.b = this.r;</code>, the <code>r</code> property and <code>b</code> property will
not be equal after the invocation. This is because the update to the <code>r</code> property seen earlier does not take effect
until after the method call is finished. Thus, the <code>b</code> property will have the previous <code>r</code> value.
</p>

<p>
The properties <code>this.b</code> and <code>this.r</code> can have the same value
through the following use of a local variable:
</p><pre>def test() {
  var r = this.r;
  if (r &gt; 0) {
     r = 0;
  } else {
     r = 1;
  }
  this.r = r;
  this.b = r;
}
</pre>


<p>
A script can be started by calling <code>start</code> on it. Likewise, you can stop it <code>stop</code>, and execute it once with <code>step</code>.
</p>

<h3 id="control-structures">Control Structures</h3>
<p>
The <code>if</code> statement is the only control structure that Shadama supports.
Loops may be supported in a future version of Shadama because the OpenGL shader language version 3.0
does support variable-count loops.
</p>
<h3 id="primitive-functions">Primitive Functions</h3>
<p>

There are a number of primitive functions that can be called from methods.
Most of them actually result in a direct call to a GLSL built-in function.
For example:
</p><pre>def prims(x) {
  var c = cos(x);
  var s = step(0.5, x);
  var a = abs(x);
  var f = fract(x); // the fraction part of x

  this.r = c * s * a * f;
}
</pre>

<p>
The above code uses several primitive functions to compute a contrived value which
is then stored into the turtle's <code>r</code> property.
</p>

<h3 id="method-binding">Method Binding</h3>
<p>
Methods are not defined for any particular breed, but a given
method can only be applied to breeds that have the properties referenced
in the method.
For example:
</p><pre>breed A (x, r)
breed B (x, y, r, g)
breed C (r)

def set() {
  this.r = 1;
  this.x = 0;
}

static test() {
  A.set();
  B.set();
}
</pre>

<p>
The <code>set</code> method above can be called for both breed <code>A</code> and breed <code>B</code>.
This is the not the case for breed C because it does not have an <code>x</code> property, which is
referenced in <code>set</code>.
</p>

<h3 id="limitations">Limitations</h3>

<p>
The following are important limitations of the Shadama language.
</p>

<p>
Methods can not take breeds as arguments.
For example, the following code is invalid:
</p><pre>breed A (x, y)
breed B (x, y)

def hit(other) {
  var diff = other.x - this.x;
  ...
}

static step() {
  A.hit(B);
}
</pre>


<p>
The <code>step</code> function passes breed B as an argument to the <code>hit</code> method, which is not allowed.
Even if it were, it is not clear which turtle from breed <code>B</code> should
be bound to the argument <code>other</code>.
</p>

<p>
Another limitation is that a given method can either update the turtle's properties or
the patch's properties, but not both.
For example, the following code is invalid:
</p><pre>def test(field) {
  field.r = 1;
  this.r = 1;
}
</pre>


<p>
This limitation arises from limitations in WebGL itself. Future
versions of WebGL, and thus Shadama, may no longer have this restriction.
In the meantime, a workaround is to split the method into two methods — one
for updating the patch and one for updating the turtle.
It is also possible that a future version of Shadama will automatically
perform this code transformation.
</p>

And then GPT4o came out, reclaiming the throne with its multimodal finesse. Today, we’re releasing something to change that: Llama3-V, the first-ever multimodal model built on top of Llama3. As a bonus, we train everything in under $500.</p><p id="9c85">How are the benchmarks you ask? We’ll let the tables speak for themselves. We have a 10–20% boost over Llava, the current SOTA and most popular model for multimodal understanding. Additionally, we fair very comparably to the closed source models of 100x the size on all metrics except MMMU.</p><figure></figure><h2 id="b6f7"><strong>Check us out on:</strong></h2><p id="9871">• 🤗: <a href="https://huggingface.co/mustafaaljadery/llama3v/tree/main" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">https://huggingface.co/mustafaaljadery/llama3v/</a></p><p id="9c17">• Github: <a href="https://github.com/mustafaaljadery/llama3v" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/mustafaaljadery/llama3v</a></p><h2 id="7795">The rest of the article covers</h2><ul><li id="ce14">Model Architecture</li><li id="422f">Training Framework</li><li id="ca98">Systems Optimizations</li><li id="68e8">Summary</li></ul><h2 id="5f28"><strong>Model Architecture</strong></h2><p id="2a6d">The bulk of our engineering efforts go into making Llama3 understand visual information. To do so, we take an input image and embed it into a series of patch embeddings using the SigLIP model. These embeddings are then aligned with the textual tokens via a projection block, which applies two self-attention blocks to put the textual and visual embeddings in the same plane. Finally, the visual tokens from the projection block are prepended to the textual tokens and the joint representation is passed into Llama3, just as it normally would.</p><figure><figcaption>Llama3-V Architecture: We use SigLIP to embed our input image in patches. Then we train a projection block with two self-attention blocks to align our textual and visual tokens.</figcaption></figure><p id="93cc">The diagram above illustrates at a high-level how everything works. Now, let’s dive into each stage in detail.</p><p id="66fa"><strong>SigLIP</strong>: SigLIP (Sigmoid Loss for Language Image Pre-Training) is an image embedding model that is similar to CLIP as we see in the figure below. However, unlike CLIP which uses a contrastive loss with softmax normalization, SigLIP utilizes a pairwise sigmoid loss, which allows the model to operate independently on each image-text pair, without requiring a global view across all pairs in a batch. At a high-level, SigLIP’s vision encoder splits the image into a sequence of non-overlapping image patches and projects them into a lower-dimensional linear embedding space, producing a sequence of patch embeddings. These patch embeddings then go through a vision encoder, which applies self-attention to capture long-range dependencies and extract higher-level visual features. For our purposes, we directly use the original SigLIP model trained by Google DeepMind.</p><figure><figcaption>Illustration of how SigLIP embeddings work. We train an image and text decoder concurrently but in our case the text encoding module is kept fixed. Unlike CLIP, we minimize a sigmoid loss instead of a softmax loss but most other things stay the same. Image from <a href="https://x.com/mervenoyann/status/1745476609686089800/photo/1" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">twitter post </a>by Merve</figcaption></figure><p id="a1f8"><strong>Alignment with textual embeddings: </strong>To save computational resources, we keep SigLIP fixed. However, to align the output image embeddings with the textual embeddings used in Llama3, we use an extra projection module. Unlike Llava, which applies a single linear layer to the original image embeddings, we instead train two self-attention blocks to better capture patterns in the input embeddings, producing the final image embedding vector.</p><p id="fcd5"><strong>Prepending image tokens:</strong> For the textual inputs, we first tokenize the text using a Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) vocabulary, producing a sequence of textual tokens. We demarcate these tokens by enclosing them within special &lt;text&gt; and &lt;/text&gt; tags. As for the image embeddings from the projection block, we treat each vector as a separate “visual token” and demarcate them using &lt;image&gt; and &lt;/image&gt; tags. Finally, we prepend the sequence of visual tokens to the sequence of textual tokens, forming the joint input representation that is passed into Llama3 for processing.</p><h2 id="75f6">Inference Optimizations</h2><p id="a1bb">Training these models is expensive. To optimize for computation resources, we make two major optimizations. The first is a simple caching mechanism and the second is on the MPS/MLX front.</p><p id="a391"><strong>Caching: </strong>The SigLIP model is much smaller than Llama3. Therefore, if we run everything serially, we have very little GPU utilization when SigLIP is running. Moreover, we can’t push the utilization up by increasing the batch size up on SigLIP as then Llama runs into OOM errors. Instead we observed that our SigLIP model stays the same and instead pre-compute the image embeddings. Then, for both pre-training and SFT, we directly pass in these precomputed image embeddings instead of re-running the SigLIP module. Not only does this allow us to increase the batch size and maximally use our GPUs for running the SigLIP modules, it also saves us training/inference time as the two parts of the pipeline can occur separately.</p><p id="df3e"><strong>MPS/MLX Optimizations: </strong>Our second optimization was again driven by SigLIP’s smaller size relative to Llama. Specifically, since SigLIP fit on our Macbooks, we ran inference on an MPS optimized SigLIP model, which allowed us to attain a throughput of 32 images/second — allowing our caching step happen relatively quickly.</p><h2 id="8756"><strong>How it was trained</strong></h2><p id="0e19"><strong>Precompute the embeddings from SigLIP: </strong>let’s now dive into the first step of our pre-training process: <em>precomputing the image embeddings via SigLIP</em>. In this step, our goal is to essentially pass in images into the SigLIP embedding model to obtain a vector representation or embedding of the image. One technical detail: due to higher resolutions, we follow the approach taken by LLaVA-UHD and perform image-splitting. The purpose of image-splitting is to divide the image into variable-sized patches or segments for more efficient encoding. These split images are processed concurrently in batches.</p><p id="b746">Now let’s dive into how exactly we use the SigLIP embedding. We first load the SigLIP model and processor/tokenizer. We then preprocess the provided input image using the processor. We then pass the preprocessed image to the model. Following this, the model outputs logits for the image-text pairs. We now proceed to apply the sigmoid activation function to the logits to get the probabilities. We now see that the image embedding is contained within these probabilities. So far this embedding captures the visual information in the image.</p><p id="7ba6">Following the computation of the image embedding via SigLIP, we now proceed to learn a projection matrix — you can also think of this as the <em>projection layer</em>, which is typically a linear or feed-forward layer. As described above in the ingredients section, the projection layer maps the vision embedding from its original space into a joint multimodal embedding space. Specifically, the projection layer applies a learned weight matrix W_v to the vision embedding v to get the projected multimodal vision embedding W_v * v. So after this projection step, the vision and text embeddings are essentially aligned into a common multimodal embedding space, allowing their representations to interact and be combined for multimodal modeling tasks like visual question answering, image captioning, etc. More specifically, the result of the projection layer is the generated “latents.”</p><p id="07a9">Once the latents are computed, we then prepend them as image tokens before the text tokens. The reason for the prepending is that having the image before the text makes it easier for the model to learn during pretraining. Think of it as having tokens representing the actual image and then tokens representing the contents of the image in text: almost like a caption paired with an image. Our architecture is nearly identical to that of LLaVA-UHD (they choose CLIP-ViT while we use SigLIP and they work with Vicuna-13B) so we provide their illustration as reference below:</p><figure></figure><p id="8bdb">Now that we’ve established the data needed for pretraining, we can dive into what that actually looks like. In pre-training, we then use 600,000 examples of prepended images to text. In this step we keep the main weights of the Llama-3 architecture frozen. The key is that we want to only update the gradients of the projection matrix. Crucially, we keep the rest of the weights frozen. And with that, we’ve wrapped up our intuition and process for the pretraining step. The key here was aligning the embedded images (latents) with their text in a joint representation and then pretraining LLaMA-3 to focus on updating the projection matrix based on the examples encountered.</p><p id="7888"><strong>Supervised Finetuning</strong></p><p id="f3f5">Following pretraining, we perform supervised finetuning to enhance the performance of our model. In this step, we are freezing our computed embeddings (from the projection layer) and we keep everything except the vision and projection matrices frozen. In other words, if you look at the image below, the red components are unfrozen while the blue components are frozen. This is meant to serve as “instruction” finetuning — in other words making the model stronger for a multimodal text output. In this stage, we use 1M examples (7M split images).</p><figure></figure><h2 id="f170"><strong>In Summary</strong></h2><ul><li id="4f32">We add a vision encoder to Llama3 8B</li><li id="0665">Our model offers 10–20% performance boosts over Llava the current open-source SOTA vision language model.</li><li id="6423">We offer comparable vision abilities of models close to 100x* larger in size like GPT4v, Gemini Ultra, and Claude Opus.</li><li id="792d">We describe an efficient pipeline to pretrain and instruction finetune the model in under $500.</li></ul></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        When an user directs their web browser to an HTTP URL, it's a common practice for the service to redirect the
        request to a corresponding HTTPS page. This unencrypted part of the communication flow has its flaws. Third
        parties in shared networks, as well as network intermediaries, could
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniffing_attack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sniff</a>
        passwords and other secrets from the initial HTTP traffic
        or even impersonate the web server with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MITM</a> attack.
        Nevertheless, redirection has been an useful first step in the transition from the largely unencrypted early web
        to the <a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/https/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">largely encrypted</a> web of today.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later techniques tightened the security story further. Servers can now send <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HSTS</a> along with the initial HTTP-to-HTTPS redirection response, telling the
        user's browser to use only HTTPS for that domain from
        then on. This limits the window of opportunity for trivial sniffing and MITM attacks to the first request.
        Browsers then added <a href="https://hstspreload.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HSTS preload
          lists</a> and <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/https-only-prefs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTTPS-Only modes</a> that allow skipping the initial unencrypted request altogether.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the perspective of usability-security tradeoff it all makes sense for user-facing sites. But interestingly,
        the redirection approach also appears to be widely adopted for APIs. APIs are mostly consumed by other software
        so the same usability arguments don't apply there. Moreover, many programmatic API clients don't tend to keep
        browser-like state of things like HSTS headers they have seen.
      </p>
      <p>
        This post argues that, due to these factors, the common practice of redirecting API calls from HTTP to
        HTTPS should be reconsidered. While the post mostly refers to REST APIs, its points also apply to other styles
        of APIs that use HTTP(S) as a transport mechanism.
      </p>

      <h2>A Simple Typo Is Enugh</h2>
      <p>
        At <a href="https://badrap.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">work</a>, we were building a new
        integration against a third-party API. The initial code commit contained a mistyped API base URL
        <code>"http://..."</code> instead of <code>"https://..."</code>. A pretty easy mistake to make.
      </p>
      <p>
        The error was essentially masked during runtime: The third-party API responded to every request with a 301
        redirect to their HTTPS side. Node.js's built-in <a href="https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/globals.html#fetch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fetch</a>
        happily and <em>quietly</em> followed those redirects to the HTTPS endpoint.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Every single one of our API requests now sent the API keys over the network in plaintext</strong>,
        before then sending them again to the encrypted endpoint. The one letter omission could have exposed the used
        API keys to third parties without us realizing it. As the integration would have worked, there's a good
        chance that code would have leaked any secrets in the API calls for years. In the long run, the
        probabilities for malice tend to accumulate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Luckily we spotted the error during the code review before the error could propagate to production or even
        testing. We also realized that our <em>own</em> API also did similar HTTP-to-HTTPS redirects.
      </p>

      <h2>The Fail-fast Principle</h2>
      <p>
        When an API redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS - and the API client silently follows those redirects - it tends to
        hide mistyped URLs like in the case described above. A simple one-letter omission can easily be ignored, end up
        in production, and compromise the entire system's confidentiality.
      </p>
      <p>
        In most cases, it's better to adhere to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-fast_system" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fail-fast principle</a>: unencrypted API calls should fail in a
        spectacular and visible way so that the developer can easily spot and fix the typo as early as possible during
        the development process.
      </p>
      <p>
        A great solution for failing fast would be to disable the API server's HTTP interface altogether and not even
        answer to connections attempts to port 80. If the initial unencrypted connection is never established then the
        API keys aren't sent, mitigating sniffing attacks and limiting the window of opportunity for MITM attacks to an
        extremely small time window. This approach is viable for APIs hosted under their own domains like
        <code>api.example.com</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our own API was served under the <code>/api</code> path from the same domain as our service's web UI. We
        didn't have the guts to disable the HTTP interface for that domain altogether, so we picked next best
        option: all unencrypted HTTP requests made under <code>/api</code> now return a descriptive error message along
        with the HTTP status code 403. Some initial plaintext requests might be made during development, but they're
        much easier for developers to notice.
      </p>

      <h2>Who Else?</h2>
      <p>
        That took care of our own API. We also pinged the third-party API provider and a couple of friends that they
        might want to check their APIs. And who knows, maybe there were some commonly used APIs that accept API keys (or
        other credentials) and also redirect from HTTP to HTTPS?
      </p>
      <p>
        I listed a bunch of well known APIs from the top of my head and did a little surveys. Several of them returned
        HTTP errors or declined to connections altogether. They're listed here with cURL spells for checking out their
        detailed responses:

      <p>
        I didn't report these findings separately to all of these API providers. There were some outliers not listed
        here that I did contact, with varying results. More on that later.
      </p>
      <p>
        Take each individual result with a grain of salt: I had to test some of these APIs without valid
        credentials, or with credentials used in documentation examples. But the overall pattern indicates that the
        habit of APIs redirecting HTTP requests to HTTPS is quite widespread. Why is that?
      </p>

      <h2>Best Practices Need Practice Too</h2>
      <p>
        When speaking with people about this topic, many have noted that HTTP-to-HTTPS redirects from APIs have obvious
        downsides - in hindsight.
      </p>
      <p>Redirects for user-facing applications are often mentioned in lists best practices and cheat sheets, <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Transport_Layer_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html#use-tls-for-all-pages" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">like the ones published by OWASP (The Open Worldwide Application
          Security Project)</a>.
        Recommendations specifically aimed for APIs seem rare in contrast. I found just few mentions, for example an
        excellent PDF slideset called <a href="https://owasp.org/www-chapter-belgium/assets/2018/2018-10-23/OWASP_20181023_CommonAPISecurityPitfalls.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">"Common API Security Pitfalls"</a> by <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@PhilippeDeRyck" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Philippe De
          Ryck</a>,
        buried deep within the OWASP website:
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img alt="Slide 8 of &quot;Common API Security Pitfalls&quot;: &quot;API-only endpoints should disable HTTP and only need to support HTTPS.&quot;" src="https://jviide.iki.fi/deryck-slide-8.png">

            section.
          </small>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        My Google-fu might just be bad. But maybe each best practice item recommending HTTP-to-HTTPS redirects
        for user-facing sites should have an explicit caveat attached, prominently advising against such redirects for
        APIs. Therefore I opened <a href="https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries/issues/1407" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">an issue</a> that suggests amending OWASP's Transport Layer Security Cheat Sheet
        accordingly.
      </p>

      <h2>Bonus Round: Popular APIs That Respond In Plaintext</h2>
      <p>
        While reviewing the list of APIs, I bumped into some popular ones that neither redirected nor failed
        unencrypted requests. They just responded to unencrypted HTTP requests with unencrypted HTTP responses, without
        enforcing HTTPS at any stage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe they had their reasons, or maybe they had just accidentally misconfigured their reverse proxies.
        Regardless, seeing that they all handle potentially sensitive data, I contacted these API providers through
        their respective security channels and explained the problem. The providers are listed below in the order of
        reporting. I'll unredact their names and details when they've given a definite response, or otherwise after
        a reasonable amount of time has passed.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Provider A</strong>: Reported on <time datetime="2024-05-17">2024-05-17</time> through their
          vulnerability reporting email address. Awaiting response.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Provider B</strong>: Reported on <time datetime="2024-05-21">2024-05-21</time> through their HackerOne
          program. Got a prompt triage response, stating that attacks requiring MITM (or physical access to a user's
          device) are outside the scope of the program. Sent back a response explaining that MITM or physical access was
          not required for sniffing. Awaiting response.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Provider C</strong>: Reported on <time datetime="2024-05-21">2024-05-21</time> through their security
          email address. Awaiting response.
        </li>
        <li id="virustotal">
          <a href="https://docs.virustotal.com/reference/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VirusTotal
            API</a>: Reported on <time datetime="2024-05-21">2024-05-21</time> through Google's <a href="https://bughunters.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bug Hunters</a> site
          (VirusTotal is owned by a Google subsidiary that got merged into Google Cloud). The
          API responds in plaintext to requests like for example this (where <code>$API_KEY</code> is a valid API key):

          <p>
            <code>curl -i -H 'x-apikey: $API_KEY' http://www.virustotal.com/api/v3/ip_addresses/1.1.1.1</code>
          </p>

          <p>
            The report got promptly triaged. Received a response on <time datetime="2024-05-24">2024-05-24</time>, cited
            in part below:
          </p>

          
          
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Redirecting HTTP to HTTPS for APIs can be more harmful than helpful due to the nature of APIs. Unlike
        user-facing web pages, APIs are primarily consumed by other software. API clients often follow redirects
        automatically and do not maintain state or support security headers like HSTS. This can lead to silent failures
        where sensitive data in each API request is initially transmitted in plaintext over the network, unencrypted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's adopt a fail-fast approach and disable the HTTP interface entirely or return clear
        error responses for unencrypted requests. This ensures that developers can quickly notice and fix accidental
        use <code>http://</code> URLs to <code>https://</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Several well-known and popular APIs also redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS. This behavior seems to be
        widespread. Maybe it's time we amend best practices to explicitly recommend that APIs flat our reject
        unencrypted requests.
      </p>

This is compensated for somewhat  by 8x oversampling/averaging.
I can feed the sampled audio into the 'Whisper' STT application

'good enough'.</p>

<p dir="auto">The code uses traditional (allbeit pared down)  MFCC feature extraction,
and simply compares buffered tensors of samples against pre-recorded
spoken digits to get a 'best match'.</p>
<p dir="auto">A timer is set up to generate an interrupt around 50,000/sec. On receiving
an interrupt, the ADC is read and the next sample convertion started.
8 consecutive samples are averaged to generate a ~6400 samples/sec audio stream.</p>
<p dir="auto">Every 64 samples (10ms), a 128-wide FFT of a buffer of the last 128 samples is
performed and 20 mel-scale frequency bins are calculated from that. The
mel bin energies  are converted to log2-scale.
Finally an 8-bin cepstrum is calculated via a DCT of the 20 log-mel bins.</p>
<p dir="auto">When the 'energy' of a frame (sum of all mel levels) is above a threshold, it is added to a 'word'
buffer, otherwise a count of 'silence' frames is increased.</p>
<p dir="auto">When enough 'silence' frames have passed to signify the end of a spoken
sample, its length is warped to exactly 16 frames and compared to a
lookup table of previously stored word samples, and the closest match
is reported.</p>

<p dir="auto">Usually 16,000 samples/sec audio is used (high fidelity), however to
reduce the audio processing required, only 6400 samples/sec audio is used here.
This is still high enough quality for accurate transcription
(the top speech formants are at around 3200Hz, everything above that is redundant
in terms of recognition).
This makes each 10ms slice of audio exactly 64 samples.</p>

<p dir="auto">20ms frames are used, compared to 25ms found elsewhere (Vosk,Whisper).  Standard 10ms
step/100fps processing is maintained though. This allows for 128-sample FFT
to be used - FFT alogrithm is optimal at power-of-2 widths, and potentially would
allow for 100% faster FFT by taking advantage of the symmetry of the algo.
The narrow-framesize is compensated for by:</p>

<li>
<p dir="auto">no windowing used. Usually the signal has a Hann window applied to  the signal before FFT, this step is skipped to avoid 'bookending' the  narrow signal.
Not windowing raises the noise-floor of the FFT output, but noise-floor removal
of the output mel bins is done to compensate.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/former-ftx-executive-ryan-salame-sentenced-90-months-prison">https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/former-ftx-executive-ryan-salame-sentenced-90-months-prison</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40504228">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Damian Williams, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced that RYAN SALAME was sentenced today to 90&nbsp;months in prison. &nbsp;SALAME previously pled guilty to conspiracy to make unlawful political contributions and defraud the Federal Election Commission and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business before U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, who imposed today’s sentence.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said: “Ryan Salame agreed to advance the interests of FTX, Alameda Research, and his co-conspirators through an unlawful political influence campaign and through an unlicensed money transmitting business, which helped FTX grow faster and larger by operating outside of the law.&nbsp; Salame’s involvement in two serious federal crimes undermined public trust in American elections and the integrity of the financial system.&nbsp; Today’s sentence underscores the substantial consequences for such offenses.”&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to the filings and statements made during court proceedings:</p>

<p>RYAN SALAME was a high-ranking official at Alameda Research, the quantitative cryptocurrency trading firm founded by Samuel Bankman-Fried, from 2019 to 2021.&nbsp; In or about October 2021, SALAME was named co-CEO of FTX’s Bahamian affiliate FTX Digital Markets Ltd.</p>

<p>While working at Alameda Research and FTX, SALAME conspired with Bankman-Fried and other employees of FTX and Alameda Research to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business, unlawfully using FTX, Alameda Research, and an entity called “North Dimension” to transmit FTX customer funds without a license.&nbsp; The conspirators and others at Alameda Research and FTX also made false statements to U.S. banks in order to maintain their unlawful businesses.</p>

<p>Additionally, beginning in or around 2020, SALAME conspired with Bankman-Fried and FTX executive Nishad Singh to donate campaign contributions in a manner that obscured Bankman-Fried’s association with certain of the contributions.&nbsp; These donations were made to improve Bankman-Fried’s personal standing in Washington, D.C., increase FTX’s profile, and curry favor with candidates that could help pass legislation favorable to FTX, Alameda, or Bankman-Fried’s personal agenda. &nbsp;In total, SALAME and his co-conspirators made over 300 political contributions, totaling tens of millions of dollars, that were unlawful because they were made in the name of a straw donor or paid for with corporate funds and caused false information to be reported by campaigns and political action committees to the Federal Election Commission.</p>

<p>* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>In addition to the prison term, SALAME, 30, of Potomac, Maryland, was sentenced to three&nbsp;years of supervised release and ordered to pay more than $6 million in forfeiture and more than $5 million in restitution.</p>

<p>Mr. Williams praised the outstanding investigative work of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This case is being handled by the Office’s Securities and Commodities Fraud Task Force, with assistance from the Office’s Illicit Finance and Money Laundering and Complex Frauds and Cybercrime Units. &nbsp;Assistant U.S. Attorneys Danielle Kudla, Samuel Raymond, Thane Rehn, Nicolas Roos, and Danielle Sassoon are in charge of the prosecution.</p>

sources were familiar with Bensouda’s formal disclosures to the ICC about the matter.

You don’t want to be getting into things that could compromise your security or that of your family.”</p><p>One individual briefed on Cohen’s activities said he had used “despicable tactics” against Bensouda as part of an ultimately unsuccessful effort to intimidate and influence her. They likened his behaviour to “stalking”.</p><p>The Mossad also took a keen interest in Bensouda’s family members and obtained transcripts of secret recordings of her husband, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the situation. Israeli officials then attempted to use the material to discredit the prosecutor.</p><p>The revelations about Cohen’s operation form part of a forthcoming investigation by the Guardian, the Israeli-Palestinian publication +972 Magazine and the Hebrew-language outlet Local Call, revealing how multiple Israel intelligence agencies ran a covert “war” against the ICC for almost a decade.</p><p>Contacted by the Guardian, a spokesperson for Israel’s prime minister’s office said: “The questions forwarded to us are replete with many false and unfounded allegations meant to hurt the state of Israel.” Cohen did not respond to a request for comment.

Another later recalled that although the Mossad “didn’t leave its signature”, it was an assumption the agency was behind some of the activity officials had been made aware of.</p><p>Only a small group of senior figures at the ICC, however, were informed that the director of the Mossad had personally approached the chief prosecutor.</p><p>A career spy, Cohen enjoys a reputation in Israel’s intelligence community as an effective recruiter of foreign agents. He was a loyal and powerful ally of the prime minister at the time, having been appointed as director of the Mossad by Netanyahu in 2016 after working for several years at his side as his national security adviser.</p><p>As the head of the national security council between 2013 and 2016, Cohen oversaw the body that, according to multiple sources, began to coordinate a multiagency effort against the ICC once Bensouda opened the preliminary inquiry in 2015.</p><p>Cohen’s first interaction with Bensouda appears to have taken place at the Munich security conference in 2017, when the Mossad director introduced himself to the prosecutor in a brief exchange. After this encounter, Cohen subsequently “ambushed” Bensouda in a bizarre episode in a Manhattan hotel suite, according to multiple sources familiar with the incident.</p><figure id="eabefa5b-5c0e-453c-906e-007ca2300738" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-5"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31a3044ba4918b2f97002bf164fcb70dfc7710ff/0_21_640_384/master/640.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31a3044ba4918b2f97002bf164fcb70dfc7710ff/0_21_640_384/master/640.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31a3044ba4918b2f97002bf164fcb70dfc7710ff/0_21_640_384/master/640.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31a3044ba4918b2f97002bf164fcb70dfc7710ff/0_21_640_384/master/640.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31a3044ba4918b2f97002bf164fcb70dfc7710ff/0_21_640_384/master/640.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31a3044ba4918b2f97002bf164fcb70dfc7710ff/0_21_640_384/master/640.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Bensouda shaking hands with a bearded Joseph Kabila" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31a3044ba4918b2f97002bf164fcb70dfc7710ff/0_21_640_384/master/640.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="267" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Bensouda with Joseph Kabila in New York.

But Grand, known by the hacker handle “Kingpin,” turns down most of them, for various reasons.</p><p>Grand is an <a data-offer-url="http://www.grandideastudio.com/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;http://www.grandideastudio.com/&quot;}" href="http://www.grandideastudio.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">electrical engineer</a> who began hacking computing hardware at age 10 and in 2008 cohosted the Discovery Channel’s <em>Prototype This</em> show. He now consults with companies that build complex digital systems to help them understand how hardware hackers like him might subvert their systems. He cracked the Trezor wallet in 2022 using complex hardware techniques that forced the USB-style wallet to reveal its password.</p><figure data-testid="IframeEmbed"><div data-testid="IframeEmbedContainer"><p><iframe height="300px" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-popups allow-same-origin" title="Embedded Frame" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/o5IySpAkThg" allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; clipboard-write; autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"></iframe></p></div></figure><p>But Michael stored his cryptocurrency in a software-based wallet, which meant none of Grand’s hardware skills were relevant this time. He considered brute-forcing Michael’s password—writing a script to automatically guess millions of possible passwords to find the correct one—but determined this wasn’t feasible. He briefly considered that the RoboForm password manager Michael used to generate his password might have a flaw in the way it generated passwords, which would allow him to guess the password more easily. Grand, however, doubted such a flaw existed.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Michael contacted multiple people who specialize in cracking cryptography; they all told him “there’s no chance” of retrieving his money. But last June he approached Grand again, hoping to convince him to help, and this time Grand agreed to give it a try, working with a friend named Bruno in Germany who also hacks digital wallets.</p><p>Grand and Bruno spent months reverse engineering the version of the RoboForm program that they thought Michael had used in 2013 and found that the pseudo-random number generator used to generate passwords in that version—and subsequent versions until 2015—did indeed have a significant flaw that made the random number generator not so random. The RoboForm program unwisely tied the random passwords it generated to the date and time on the user’s computer—it determined the computer’s date and time, and then generated passwords that were predictable. If you knew the date and time and other parameters, you could compute any password that would have been generated on a certain date and time in the past.</p><p>If Michael knew the day or general time frame in 2013 when he generated it, as well as the parameters he used to generate the password (for example, the number of characters in the password, including lower- and upper-case letters, figures, and special characters), this would narrow the possible password guesses to a manageable number. Then they could hijack the RoboForm function responsible for checking the date and time on a computer and get it to travel back in time, believing the current date was a day in the 2013 time frame when Michael generated his password. RoboForm would then spit out the same passwords it generated on the days in 2013.</p><p>There was one problem: Michael couldn’t remember when he created the password.</p><p>According to the log on his software wallet, Michael moved bitcoin into his wallet for the first time on April 14, 2013. But he couldn’t remember if he generated the password the same day or some time before or after this. So, looking at the parameters of other passwords he generated using RoboForm, Grand and Bruno configured RoboForm to generate 20-character passwords with upper- and lower-case letters, numbers, and eight special characters from March 1 to April 20, 2013.</p><p>It failed to generate the right password. So Grand and Bruno lengthened the time frame from April 20 to June 1, 2013, using the same parameters. Still no luck.</p><p>Michael says they kept coming back to him, asking if he was sure about the parameters he’d used. He stuck to his first answer.</p><p>“They really annoyed me, because who knows what I did 10 years ago,” he recalls. He found other passwords he generated with RoboForm in 2013, and two of them did not use special characters, so Grand and Bruno adjusted. Last November, they reached out to Michael to set up a meeting in person. “I thought, ‘Oh my God, they will ask me again for the settings.”</p><p>Instead, they revealed that they had finally found the correct password—no special characters. It was generated on May 15, 2013, at 4:10:40 pm GMT.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>“We ultimately got lucky that our parameters and time range was right. If either of those were wrong, we would have … continued to take guesses/shots in the dark,” Grand says in an email to WIRED. “It would have taken significantly longer to precompute all the possible passwords.”</p><p>Grand and Bruno <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5IySpAkThg">created a video</a> to explain the technical details more thoroughly.</p><p>RoboForm, made by US-based Siber Systems, was one of the first password managers on the market, and <a data-offer-url="https://earthweb.com/roboform-users/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://earthweb.com/roboform-users/&quot;}" href="https://earthweb.com/roboform-users/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">currently has more than 6 million users</a> worldwide, according to a company report. In 2015, Siber seemed to fix the RoboForm password manager. In a cursory glance, Grand and Bruno couldn’t find any sign that the pseudo-random number generator in the 2015 version used the computer’s time, which makes them think they removed it to fix the flaw, though Grand says they would need to examine it more thoroughly to be certain.</p><p>Siber Systems confirmed to WIRED that it did fix the issue with version 7.9.14 of RoboForm, released June 10, 2015, but a spokesperson wouldn’t answer questions about how it did so. In a <a data-offer-url="https://www.roboform.com/news-windows" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.roboform.com/news-windows&quot;}" href="https://www.roboform.com/news-windows" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">changelog</a> on the company’s website, it mentions only that Siber programmers made changes to&nbsp;“increase randomness of generated passwords,” but it doesn’t say how they did this. Siber spokesman Simon Davis says that “RoboForm 7 was discontinued in 2017.”</p><p>Grand says that, without knowing how Siber fixed the issue, attackers may still be able to regenerate passwords generated by versions of RoboForm released before the fix in 2015. He’s also not sure if current versions contain the problem.</p><p>“I'm still not sure I would trust it without knowing how they actually improved the password generation in more recent versions,” he says. “I'm not sure if RoboForm knew how bad this particular weakness was.”</p><p>Customers may also still be using passwords that were generated with the early versions of the program before the fix. It doesn’t appear that Siber ever notified customers when it released the fixed version 7.9.14 in 2015 that they should generate new passwords for critical accounts or data. The company didn’t respond to a question about this.</p><p>If Siber didn’t inform customers, this would mean that anyone like Michael who used RoboForm to generate passwords prior to 2015—and are still using those passwords—may have vulnerable passwords that hackers can regenerate.</p><p>“We know that most people don't change passwords unless they're prompted to do so,” Grand says. “Out of 935 passwords in my password manager (not RoboForm), 220 of them are from 2015 and earlier, and most of them are [for] sites I still use.”</p><p>Depending on what the company did to fix the issue in 2015, newer passwords may also be vulnerable.</p><p>Last November, Grand and Bruno deducted a percentage of bitcoins from Michael’s account for the work they did, then gave him the password to access the rest. The bitcoin was worth $38,000 per coin at the time. Michael waited until it rose to $62,000 per coin and sold some of it. He now has 30 BTC, now worth $3 million, and is waiting for the value to rise to $100,000 per coin.</p><p>Michael says he was lucky that he lost the password years ago because, otherwise, he would have sold off the bitcoin when it was worth $40,000 a coin and missed out on a greater fortune.</p><p>“That I lost the password was financially a good thing.”</p></div></div></div>]]></description>
