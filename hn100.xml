<p>We‚Äôre excited to announce the general release of Pi-hole v6!</p>
<h3>At a glance: What‚Äôs New in Pi-hole v6?</h3>
<h4>1. <strong>Embedded Web Server and REST API</strong></h4>
<p>We‚Äôve integrated a new REST API and embedded web server directly into the <code>pihole-FTL</code> binary. This eliminates the need for <code>lighttpd</code> and <code>PHP</code>, reducing the installation footprint and boosting performance. The new API also offers server-side pagination for the query log, ensuring a faster and more responsive interface.</p>
<p>As <code>lua</code> has been embedded into the <code>pihole-FTL</code> binary for <a href="https://github.com/pi-hole/FTL/pull/913">some time now</a>, we have been able to leverage this to rewrite the web interface.<strong><code></code></strong></p>
<h4>2. <strong>Advanced Filtering and Allowlists</strong></h4>
<p>Pi-hole v6 introduces support for subscribed allowlists (Otherwise known as ‚ÄúAntigravity‚Äù). These lists work in much the same way as blocklists, but they&nbsp;<em>allow&nbsp;</em>domains instead of&nbsp;<em>denying</em> them</p>
<h4>3. <strong>Consolidated Configuration Files</strong></h4>
<p>We‚Äôve streamlined configuration management by consolidating multiple settings files into a single, richly commented <code>toml</code> file, making it easier to manage and understand your settings. If you are migrating from v5, your existing configurations will be migrated automatically into this file. It can be found at <code>/etc/pihole/pihole.toml</code></p>
<p>Configuration can be set in multiple ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Directly editing the <code>toml</code> file</li>
<li>Via the command line, e.g <code>pihole-FTL --config dns.upstreams 8.8.8.8</code></li>
<li>Using the API</li>
<li>Via the web interface (which uses the API üòâ)</li>
<li>Via environment variables named, e.g <code>FTLCONF_dns_upstreams=8.8.8.8</code></li>
</ul>
<p>If setting via environment variables, it should be noted that this effectively makes the setting read-only, as the environment variable will always force the value to match itself. This is the preferred way to configure FTL in the docker container.</p>
<h4>4. <strong>Redesigned User Interface</strong></h4>
<p>The web interface has been completely overhauled with settings split into Basic and Expert modes. This allows users to customize their experience based on their comfort level and needs.</p>
<h4>5. <strong>HTTPS Support</strong></h4>
<p>Pi-hole v6 includes native HTTPS support, with options to provide your own certificates or use auto-generated ones.</p>
<h4>6. <strong>Docker</strong></h4>
<p>Additionally, the Docker image is now based on Alpine, significantly reducing the image size and opening up possibilities for future system support.</p>
<h3>Upgrading and Getting Started</h3>
<h4>Bare Metal</h4>
<p>Upgrading to Pi-hole v6&nbsp; should be straightforward. For existing users, we recommend backing up your current configuration before proceeding, as the upgrade is strictly a one-way operation.</p>
<p>During the upgrade operation, you will be presented with a dialog box asking if you wish to disable <code>lighttpd</code>. Doing so is probably appropriate for most users ‚Äì unless you are using it to host web pages&nbsp;<em>other than</em> Pi-hole‚Äôs, in which case you may choose to keep it enabled. With <code>lighttpd</code> disabled, <code>pihole-FTL</code> will attempt to bind to ports 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS. If there is any conflict on these ports, then it will revert to port 8080 for HTTP.</p>
<h4>Docker</h4>
<p>The docker image has undergone a complete rewrite from the ground up, and is now based on Alpine rather than Debian.&nbsp;The same migration scripts that run on bare metal will also run on Docker ‚Äì your configurations will be migrated to the new format.</p>
<p>The exception to this is environment variables. You can start the container with the old variables in place but don‚Äôt expect them to work! It is recommended to read the docker section of our <a href="https://docs.pi-hole.net/docker/">docs page</a> before upgrading.</p>

<p>Spread across NASA's headquarters and 10 field centers, which dot the United States from sea to sea, the space agency has had a workforce of nearly <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/organization/#:~:text=The%20agency's%20organization%20comprises%20a,for%20the%20benefit%20of%20humanity.">18,000 civil servants</a>.</p>
<p>However, by the end of today, that number will have shrunk by about 10 percent since the beginning of the second Trump administration four weeks ago. And the world's preeminent space agency may still face significant additional cuts.</p>
<p>According to sources, about 750 employees at NASA accepted the "fork in the road" offer to take deferred resignation from the space agency later this year. This sounds like a lot of people, but generally about 1,000 people leave the agency every year, so effectively, many of these people might just be getting paid to leave jobs they were already planning to exit from.</p>
<p>The culling of "probationary" employees will be more impactful. As it has done at other federal agencies, the Trump administration is generally firing federal employees who are in the "probationary" period of their employment, which includes new hires within the last one or two years or long-time employees who have moved into or been promoted into a new position. About 1,000 or slightly more employees at NASA were impacted by these cuts.</p>
<p>Adding up the deferred resignations and probationary cuts, the Trump White House has now trimmed about 10 percent of the agency's workforce.</p>
<p>However, the cuts may not stop there. Two sources told Ars that directors at the agency's field centers have been told to prepare options for a "significant" reduction in force in the coming months. The scope of these cuts has not been defined, and it's possible they may not even happen, given that the White House must negotiate budgets for NASA and other agencies with the US Congress. But this directive for further reductions in force casts more uncertainty on an already demoralized workforce and signals that the Trump administration would like to make further cuts.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<h2>An awful week</h2>
<p>Job losses are always terrible. This will be a dark and painful day at a space agency that brings so much light and joy to the world. Many of the probationary employees are just starting out their careers and were likely thrilled to land a job at NASA to explore the universe. And then all of that youthful energy and hope was extinguished this week.</p>
<p>It's possible to view these losses through a couple of lenses.</p>
<p>Yes, NASA is clearly losing some capability with these latest cuts. Many of these hires were likely being counted on to bring new energy into the space agency and become its future discoverers and leaders. And their jobs are being sacrificed for no clear purpose. Is it to increase funding for the military? Is it to pay for tax cuts for the rich? There is a lot of anger that the relatively thin budget line of NASA‚Äîless than one-half of 1 percent of the federal budget‚Äîis being sliced for such purposes.</p>

<p>There is also frustration at the indiscriminate nature of the cuts. The Trump White House and the Department of Government Efficiency, spearheaded by Elon Musk, have taken a meat-cleaver approach by firing a lot of people at the same time, and probably not the right people, through a messy and painful process. This is not dissimilar to job cuts during corporate mergers or bankruptcies. It's the fastest possible way to make cuts. There is no empathy, and it is a brutal process.</p>
<h2>Are cuts needed?</h2>
<p>It is also clear that, as within other federal agencies, there is significant "bloat" in NASA's budget. In some areas, this is plain to see, with the space agency having spent in excess of $3 billion a year over the last decade "developing" a heavy lift rocket, the Space Launch System, which used components from the Space Shuttle and costs an extraordinary amount of money to fly. In the meantime, the private launch industry has been running circles around NASA. Similarly, consider the Orion spacecraft. This program is now two decades old, at a cost of $1 billion a year, and the vehicle has never flown humans into space.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>One could go on. Much of the space community has been puzzled as to why NASA has been spending on the order of half a billion dollars to develop a Lunar Gateway in an odd orbit around the Moon. It remains years away from launching, and if it ever does fly, it would increase the energy needed to reach the surface of the Moon. The reason, according to multiple sources at the agency when the Gateway was conceived, is that the lunar space station would offer jobs to the current flight controllers operating the International Space Station, which is due to retire in 2030.</p>
<p>In recent years, NASA has been in the midst of a difficult transition. The agency deserves a lot of credit for nurturing a commercial space industry that now is the envy of the world. But as part of this, NASA has been moving away from owning and operating its rockets, spacecraft, and other hardware and buying services from this commercial space industry. This transition from traditional space to commercial space marks an important step for NASA to remain on the cutting edge of exploration and science rather than trying to compete with US industry.</p>
<p>But it is also a painful step.</p>
<p>The key is ensuring that any future cuts at NASA are not indiscriminate. If and when Jared Isaacman is confirmed by the US Senate as the next NASA administrator, it will be up to him and his team to make the programmatic decisions about which parts of the agency are carrying their weight and which are being carried, which investments carry NASA into the future, and which ones drag it into the past. If these future cuts are smart and position NASA for the future, this could all be worth it. If not, then the beloved agency that dares to explore may never recover.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-body">
<p>Acer Laptop prices in the U.S. are set to rise by 10% from March 2025, commented CEO Jason Chen in an interview with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/02/16/computer-giant-to-raise-prices-by-10pc-in-response-to-trump/" data-url="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/02/16/computer-giant-to-raise-prices-by-10pc-in-response-to-trump/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">The Telegraph</a>. Chen states that the price hike is a direct result of the Trump administration's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/tech-enthusiasts-brace-for-trump-tariff-price-hikes-on-new-components" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/tech-enthusiasts-brace-for-trump-tariff-price-hikes-on-new-components">incoming tariffs</a>.</p><p>"We will have to adjust the end user price to reflect the tariff," Chen said to The Telegraph. "We think 10% probably will be the default price increase because of the import tax. It's very straightforward," the Acer CEO continued.</p><p>The decision to increase prices was reportedly confirmed last week, with the Taiwanese tech giant remaining unaffected by tariffs on products that left China before February. Therefore, stock hitting U.S. channels afterward will be subject to increased tariffs.</p><p>Acer's most expensive laptop on sale, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/acer-predator-triton-17-x-hands-on" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/acer-predator-triton-17-x-hands-on">Acer Predator Triton</a> 17-inch gaming laptop, is currently $3,799 at Best Buy. But, next month that price is set to increase to $4,178 if increases are passed directly to consumers. It's unclear if the blanket price rise will also affect products currently sitting on shelves, but it's likely that as new stock arrives, older stock will also be subject to the price increase.</p><p>Chen notes that the incoming tariff may offer an 'excuse' for others in the segment to raise prices by more than 10%. No other PC manufacturer has made a public statement regarding the incoming tariffs and inevitable price rises.</p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check=""><div><p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9ZYDEpNG4ZUa8GxJsXGLRF-320-80.jpg.webp 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9ZYDEpNG4ZUa8GxJsXGLRF-480-80.jpg.webp 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9ZYDEpNG4ZUa8GxJsXGLRF-650-80.jpg.webp 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9ZYDEpNG4ZUa8GxJsXGLRF-970-80.jpg.webp 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9ZYDEpNG4ZUa8GxJsXGLRF-1024-80.jpg.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9ZYDEpNG4ZUa8GxJsXGLRF-1200-80.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)"><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9ZYDEpNG4ZUa8GxJsXGLRF-320-80.jpg" alt="Acer Predator Triton 17 X" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9ZYDEpNG4ZUa8GxJsXGLRF-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9ZYDEpNG4ZUa8GxJsXGLRF-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9ZYDEpNG4ZUa8GxJsXGLRF-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9ZYDEpNG4ZUa8GxJsXGLRF-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9ZYDEpNG4ZUa8GxJsXGLRF-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9ZYDEpNG4ZUa8GxJsXGLRF-1200-80.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" loading="lazy" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9ZYDEpNG4ZUa8GxJsXGLRF.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9ZYDEpNG4ZUa8GxJsXGLRF.jpg"></picture></p></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description"><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Acer shifted the assembly of its desktop PCs away from China during Trump's previous term and says that it is "looking at different supply chains beyond China", with U.S. production "one of the options" being considered.</p><p>The Consumer Technology Association claims that 80% of U.S. laptop imports currently come from China and that the incoming tariff could set U.S. customers back a collective $143 billion, hurting sales.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p>What‚Äôs the craziest thing you‚Äôve ever done?</p><p><strong>‚ÄúIt would feel so good to say goodbye, when I‚Äôm with you I wanna die!‚Äù</strong> Typically you would try to time your footsteps to the beat of the song‚Äîa permanent habit from your time in a marching band‚Äîbut the tempo of this one is not compatible with your walking pace. You‚Äôre singing at full volume now. <strong>‚ÄúAnd all that time was such a waste, I never wanna see your face.‚Äù</strong> You turn to the left, then to the right, and a quick glance behind. There‚Äôs an elementary school on the other side of the fence, but nobody is outside at the moment. You‚Äôre satisfied that it is safe to continue. <strong>‚ÄúI just want to get the fuck away!‚Äù</strong></p><p>You just demonstrated self-awareness. Forethought. Maybe you‚Äôre not crazy.</p><p>You are, however, several miles beyond the last familiar landmark. There‚Äôs nothing really specific that you‚Äôre navigating toward, no clear final destination in mind. This sort of walk has no natural end of its own. It‚Äôs over when you feel like you‚Äôve traveled far enough to escape the compulsion to keep increasing that distance.</p><p>You spot another mangled and flattened plastic bottle at the edge of the sidewalk. You give this one a little kick too. It slides unsatisfyingly and comes to rest in the grass. Maybe this journey is simply over when you decide it‚Äôs over. Perhaps there is no special signal that flashes brightly to tell you that.</p><p>Ugh, that is an exhausting thought. For the moment, it‚Äôs easier to keep walking.</p><hr><p><em>‚ÄúThe ideal candidate will be punched in the stomach.‚Äù</em></p><p>Aside from that one odd line of text, the responsibilities and requirements were a perfect match.</p><p>Ten minutes ago you weren‚Äôt considering switching jobs‚Äîyou hadn‚Äôt even been searching for anything outside of your current role. It was nothing but a stroke of pure randomness that scrolled this posting across your screen. Your subconscious latched onto it before your thinking brain knew what it was looking at. This job, it was <em>you.</em> Every sentence, every bullet point, they all described you and your career experience up to that point. As far as you could tell, they had been searching for nobody except you. Except for the punching part, that was a little weird. But still, every single other word on that page matched your skills and your experience.</p><p>You fire off a copy of your r√©sum√© and a quick but reasonably well-crafted cover letter. Early Monday morning you receive an email from their internal recruiter. The phone call comes later that afternoon, and by Wednesday morning you‚Äôre arriving in front of their midtown headquarters for an interview.</p><p>The company easily employs tens of thousands of people globally, and the opulence of the building‚Äôs lobby is accordant to that kind of scale. The first three stories of this office tower are devoted to the lobby, reception area, and mezzanine. You‚Äôre not one to throw the word ‚Äúgrand‚Äù around, but this might be one of the few spaces where the description really fits. You walk up to one of the five receptionists‚Äîthe only one not currently interacting with a guest‚Äîand tell her who you are. She takes your picture, scans your driver‚Äôs license, and prints a visitor badge that you delicately align over your pocket. Gotta make sure it‚Äôs perfect; can‚Äôt make a good first impression with an askew badge. ‚ÄúSeventeenth floor,‚Äù she yawns. You thank her and walk toward the elevators.</p><p>It is close to ten o‚Äôclock in the morning and a steady stream of employees is still hustling in. They pass through a line of glass-gated turnstiles. As each employee taps their badge, the turnstile emits a pleasant green and the glass retracts just long enough for them to pass through, then it snaps closed again. From a distance it kind of resembles a dozen mouths snapping up little morsels of food. You were directed to the gate at the far end, which the receptionist opens manually as you approach. Beyond that, two banks of eight elevators each. Doors open, people stream in, doors close. You embed yourself within a cluster of bodies who enter one of the open elevator cars and reach to press the button labeled ‚Äú17,‚Äù but there are no buttons. All you find is a large screen that says ‚ÄúServing floors 4, 7, 11, 20‚Ä¶‚Äù but no 17. You push yourself out of the car and back out into the lobby. There are no call buttons either. Each door has a screen above it that indicates the floors that will be visited, yet none of them say 17. There is no pattern that you can discern by looking above the doors or walking between the two elevator banks.</p><p>You‚Äôre getting frazzled, and it‚Äôs starting to get late. You wanted to arrive a few minutes early to be calm and collected, but this is making you confused and concerned. You push your way back out through the gate and return to the receptionist you just spoke to, who is now checking in another visitor. When she sees you again, her eyes roll a little bit. ‚ÄúSo, when you go through the turnstile, it calls the elevator for you. Look at the screen on your left, and go to the elevator car it says.‚Äù Clearly you are not the first person she‚Äôs given these instructions to.</p><p>‚ÄúOh. Thank you.‚Äù You return to the gate to do as instructed. Car 5. Sure enough, the screen over the doors of the fifth elevator car includes 17. As you wait for the doors to open, you take one more look at the sheer scale of the lobby. Sunlight pours through the window and dances across the marble floor as it reflects off the chomping turnstiles. The overhead lights, dear God, how did they suspend things so large so far above the ground?</p><p>As the elevator doors close, you have a fleeting thought: Whoever has to climb the ladder and maintain those light fixtures, hopefully they get hazard pay.</p><hr><p>The interview, consisting of three 60-minute meetings back-to-back in a conference room named ‚ÄúCsonka‚Äù for some reason, is basically cake. You cannot recall another instance where things have gone so well, with answers flowing so freely, where everybody in attendance is just energized to be there. Smiles are flashed, firm handshakes are exchanged, ‚ÄúI look forward to working with you‚Äù are the parting words from everyone you meet. The final meeting is a one-on-one with Chris the hiring manager, the person who might very well be your future supervisor based on your read of the situation. This, too, goes well. It‚Äôs gotta be a dream. It‚Äôs gotta be fake. Clearly there is something about this that you have completely missed.</p><p>‚ÄúSo, do you have any questions for me?‚Äù</p><p>You push aside your elation for a second and ponder Chris‚Äôs question. Actually‚Ä¶ yeah, there is one. That bit from the job posting about being punched in the stomach. You diplomatically ask him about it.</p><p>‚ÄúWell, yeah. That‚Äôs the role. You would be getting punched in the stomach. By me. That is the core of the day-to-day responsibilities planned for this position.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ I come in, you punch me in the stomach, and then‚Ä¶‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúThen you‚Äôre done! Also, and this is more of a per-department thing, but in our org we‚Äôre not sticklers about the whole nine-to-five, track-your-hours thing. Once you‚Äôve been punched in the stomach, you‚Äôre free to go home if there‚Äôs no other priority task.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúI come in, you punch me in the stomach, and I go home?‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúExactly right. It sounds like we won‚Äôt really have to spend all that much time onboarding. You seem to know just what needs to be done to really make an impact on this team. We‚Äôd be excited to have you join.‚Äù</p><p>For the first time in nearly three hours, you are absolutely speechless. There is no conceivable follow-up question for something like that. No insights, no empty platitudes, no rational thing that could be said to bring this exchange back into any territory that could broadly be considered normal.</p><p>‚ÄúAh. Thank you for the explanation.‚Äù The only words that were polite but nonspecific enough to fill the absolutely dead air that now fills the room.</p><p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be in touch!‚Äù</p><hr><p>It is now Friday afternoon, and you‚Äôre back in the lobby having a new visitor badge printed. You know how the elevators work now, plus the receptionist from the other day is busy with somebody else. There‚Äôs a good chance you‚Äôll make it through this part without anyone thinking you‚Äôre some kind of moron.</p><p>Chris had emailed you that the role was yours if you wanted it, and he extended an invitation to show you around the office some more before negotiations began. He greets you as you step off the elevator onto the seventeenth floor, and the whirlwind tour begins.</p><p>The entire floor is an open plan with desks grouped into islands, except for a number of executive-looking offices clustered in the far corners. The center of the floor is a ring of conference rooms. The sun pours through the floor-to-ceiling glass panes on the south face of the building. Each employee is sitting in a gaming chair that looks very expensive but also a little ridiculous. There are two, sometimes three computer screens at each workstation, with a total display area larger than the TV in your living room. Jeans and pullover hoodies are the predominant dress code, although Chris wears a sweater vest on top of a plaid collared shirt.</p><p>All around you, the typical hallmarks of a company with slightly more money than sense. Dart boards (plural), ping-pong tables (plural), a kitchen area stocked with free drinks and snacks, and an entire wall of displays showing real-time numbers and charts. Everybody seems, at the moment, to be in the ‚Äúwork hard‚Äù mode rather than the ‚Äúplay hard‚Äù one. The PlayStation nook is unoccupied and a brief scan of the space only finds two employees actively drinking beers. Chris taps the shoulder of one of these people, who then removes his prominent noise-canceling headphones.</p><p>‚ÄúJon! Hey, Jon the man!‚Äù That particular adulation might‚Äôve made sense for a rhyming name like Stan or Dan; this just sounded like a catachresis. ‚ÄúYou got a second? I wanted you to meet the candidate we‚Äôve been talking to.‚Äù</p><p>You introduce yourself to Jon, and he reciprocates.</p><p>‚ÄúSo yeah, he‚Äôs gonna be helping us out soon. Isn‚Äôt that right?‚Äù Chris slaps you on the back of the shoulder, rather hard. You smile politely.</p><hr><p>Walking into salary negotiations with Chris, you suspected that this was not a job that you particularly wanted. You failed to see the allure of anything he had just shown you, especially considering that the entire scope of the job was to get punched in the stomach and then leave. Still, no point in walking away before finding out where this particular road might lead.</p><p>Chris slides you a binder‚Äîliterally a three-ring binder‚Äîfilled with sheets of paper and benefits booklets. It‚Äôs yours to keep regardless of the choice you make. He summarizes the top-line bits: Medical/dental/vision fully paid by the company, a sponsored 401(k) plan with an employer match, ‚Äúunlimited‚Äù-in-air-quotes paid time off, pretax employee stock purchase plan, and a separate stock option grant on top of it all.</p><p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôve considered your past experience and skill set and want to bring you on as an individual contributor, level five. You‚Äôre a little bit on the low end of that band, but this is what we think your total package should be.‚Äù He pulls a sheet of paper out of his folder and slides it face-up toward your side of the table.</p><p>Jesus Christ. <em>Jesus Actual Christ.</em></p><p>Conventional wisdom states that you always negotiate. You always try to get more. But this, this is <em>at least</em> triple what you‚Äôre currently making. You close your eyes tightly and open them again, thinking maybe you‚Äôre misreading the numbers and something‚Äôs getting transposed or‚Ä¶ who knows. Nope, that‚Äôs really what it says.</p><p>You briefly try to formulate some kind of negotiating tactic, but these numbers are <em>complicated</em> and your ability to mentally estimate percentages is faltering. It‚Äôs like spending a lifetime calculating tip amounts for dinner at Chili‚Äôs, and now you‚Äôre trying to do the same thing in a fancy black tie steakhouse. The numbers just don‚Äôt come. Oh well, screw it, this is more than fine enough.</p><p>‚ÄúThis all looks fantastic,‚Äù you say.</p><p>‚ÄúGreat! We‚Äôll give you a little bit of time to go over the benefits package, maybe talk it over with your family or whoever. We‚Äôll get you the formal paperwork first thing Monday. Do you have more of a sense of when you‚Äôd be able to start?‚Äù</p><p>You believe that you owe your current employer the customary two weeks as a professional courtesy. Chris is visibly disappointed that you feel the need to make him wait that long. Through some kind of mind trick, he talks you down to one week.</p><hr><p>At home, alone with your thoughts, you start reading through the small library of documentation that Chris had given you. Every single thing about this company‚Äôs compensation package is more generous, more comprehensive, and potentially more lucrative than any other thing you have ever been offered by any employer you have been with before. This will be the highest base salary you have ever received and‚Äîif you‚Äôre being brutally honest with yourself‚Äîplausibly the most you might ever receive.</p><p>On top of that, this is a publicly-traded company, and that stock option grant has a not-insignificant number of shares listed on it. You can easily look up the day‚Äôs trading price and figure out roughly what that grant is worth. It requires the use of a calculator, but holy moly. Of course, they‚Äôre doled out monthly over a four-year vesting period. There‚Äôs also a one-year cliff where you won‚Äôt get squat if you leave during the first twelve months.</p><p>Twelve months. You stare across the room for a moment. Twelve months‚Ä¶ of punches. You look down at your calculator‚Äôs display, still dutifully showing the substantial and precise number yielded by the most recent press of the ‚Äúequals‚Äù button. For the first time in a long time, you have an actual impactful decision to make and a whole lot of conflicting opinions about which path to take.</p><p>You‚Äôre vaguely aware of philosophical terms like ‚Äúprinciples‚Äù and ‚Äúvalues,‚Äù but damned if you can remember the specific differences between the two. You‚Äôd be compromising, uh‚Ä¶ hell, you don‚Äôt even know. It feels somehow amoral to try to maximize monetary gain above all other factors. But that‚Äôs the way this world works sometimes: You have to do whatever you can to get yourself ahead in life, and once you transcend above this constant grind you can finally, you know, uh‚Ä¶ dammit.</p><p>Okay, new approach. You have a job, it pays <em>X</em>. Do you like doing it? Well, no, not really. Is there any specific thing you can think of that you would miss if you were to leave? Nope. Is there any chance you could negotiate to get them to give you even a fraction of the <em>3X</em> that this new place is offering? Almost certainly no, and it would be cringingly uncomfortable to even attempt it.</p><p>Now the new place. Aside from the fact that you would be getting punched in the stomach every day, is there <em>anything</em> about the arrangement that makes it less attractive than the job you already have? You think long and hard, replaying event after event in your mind looking for outliers‚Ä¶ Equivalent commute, nicer office, shorter hours. Effectively no other negatives. Everything tells you to make the jump. Aside from the punching. That‚Äôs, you know‚Ä¶ You can probably learn to cope with that, right?</p><p>Monday comes. You sign the offer and it is countersigned with a bit of scrawl you can‚Äôt decipher, most likely belonging to a member of HR or Legal that you will never encounter again. You inform your current manager that you‚Äôll be gone before this time next week. He does not hide his disappointment, and his response makes you feel terrible. Why? This is supposed to be business, isn‚Äôt it? You never really understood what good could come from bringing emotion into it.</p><p>Your soon-to-be-ex-manager informs the rest of your team the following day, and a stream of tepid congratulations follow. Next week they‚Äôll all be stuck doing the tasks you left behind. You know exactly how it feels to be on the receiving end of that; you‚Äôve watched peers leave during inopportune times before.</p><p>Is there ever really an opportune time?</p><p>The next three and a half days are just strange. Nobody asks you to do anything. Nobody calls on you in meetings. It is like you have some kind of contagious disease and everybody is trying to keep their distance from you. <em>It is as if you are slowly turning invisible.</em> HR calls you down for a customary exit interview to try to determine what might have been going wrong and what they could have done to keep you. When you tell the interviewer who your next employer is and some of what they are offering, the response is simply, ‚ÄúAh. I understand your reasoning now. Well, that‚Äôs all the questions I had.‚Äù</p><p>You return to your desk, take one last look through the drawers, and turn off the screen. You stand up your ID badge in between some of the number keys on the keyboard, sling your bag over your shoulder, and walk out for the last time.</p><p>Your team does not see you leave. They‚Äôre all in a conference room conducting a meeting that you were not invited to.</p><hr><p>Monday morning, 8:50 a.m., moderate drizzle. The lobby looks starkly different from the last two times you‚Äôve been here, with a distinctly orange hue coming from the overhead light fixtures. The flashes of green from the turnstiles give your skin an almost putrid pallor. You don‚Äôt have your ID badge yet, so you‚Äôre waiting for the receptionist to print a visitor badge and let you in. As per the universe‚Äôs sick sense of humor, you got the receptionist from your first visit again.</p><p>‚ÄúSeventeenth floor,‚Äù she sighs. ‚ÄúYou remember how the elevators work?‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúSure do,‚Äù you try to smile. Deep down, though, the interaction hurt. You work here now, she and you are supposed to be on the same team. Why‚Äôs she being so snarky to her <em>colleague?</em></p><p>Oh well, game time. Can‚Äôt let things like that get to you.</p><p>You exit the elevator at the seventeenth floor. Nobody greets you. There is no obvious place to sit while you wait, so you slowly retrace the steps that you took when Chris showed you around. You spot a pair of faces you recognize from your interview, but you have completely forgotten both of their names. (You know, you‚Äôre supposed to be a professional adult. People tell you their names, the least you could do is try to remember them. It‚Äôs rude. Do better, you jerk.)</p><p>‚ÄúHey guys, I made it!‚Äù You wave, they wave back. You had briefly agonized over how to phrase that in a way that would belie the fact that you had no idea what to call either of them. ‚ÄúIs Chris around?‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs in yet, but his desk is over there. You can probably hang out in the conference room.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúThanks! See you around.‚Äù</p><p>Chris‚Äôs desk is right across from a door marked ‚ÄúElway‚Äù at the center of a wall of solid glass. On either side, ‚ÄúDavis‚Äù and ‚ÄúFlacco.‚Äù You dimly perceive that this is a sports-related naming convention, although you hope very hard that nobody ever asks you about your thoughts regarding it. You step into the Elway room and the motion-sensitive lights turn themselves on. You drape your damp coat over one of the seatbacks and take a seat in the chair closest to the door. The one thing you feel you could do naturally‚Äîstare blankly at your phone‚Äîis the one thing you don‚Äôt want to be seen doing during the first hour of your first day. So you fold your hands nervously and look out through the glass.</p><p>Fifteen minutes and who knows how many employees pass outside. The conference room lights turn themselves off. Now you are sitting, hands folded, alone in the dark. You stand up so the lights will acknowledge your presence again, and they turn back on. You return to your seated position.</p><p>Through the glass, in the distance, you can see Chris turn the corner around the lunch area. He is once again wearing a sweater vest over a plaid collared shirt, a uniform you haven‚Äôt seen worn by anybody else on this floor so far. You look up at the Office Depot‚Äìbranded wall clock, which stands out as being the only object in this building that seems like it cost less than ten dollars. 9:29, although you are not quite sure how accurately it had been set.</p><p>‚ÄúChris! Hey! Good morning!‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúGood morning, welcome aboard! So, we usually do this over in Jackson.‚Äù He points, you look over your shoulder. ‚ÄúI just need a quick minute to get settled, and I‚Äôll meet you over there.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúGotcha, thanks.‚Äù</p><p>Jackson is about halfway around the ring of conference rooms. It is starkly different from its neighbors, having no table, whiteboard, TV, or even a lowly wall clock. Most of its light comes from outside the glass wall; the room‚Äôs single row of overhead lights appears to be permanently dimmed. There is a row of about a half-dozen of the ridiculous gaming chairs, each one appearing broken in some way, lining the far wall. Even with no other furniture, it feels cramped. You lay your coat on the ground and survey this other side of the office through the glass. A good chunk of the floor space on this side is lost to a hallway, bathrooms, and other unexciting facets of skyscraper design. Several of the smaller executive offices are on this side as well. Every door is closed. The view of the city outside isn‚Äôt nearly as breathtaking as it is on the other side, but you can tell well enough that the rain has really picked up. Autumn doesn‚Äôt technically start for another few weeks, but it‚Äôs beginning to feel like it‚Äôs arrived already.</p><p>Chris whips around the corner and steps into the conference room. Each move he makes is forceful and commanding, and his entrance is accompanied by a rush of air that carries the scent of a cologne that could best be described as ‚Äúa cologne.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúSorry about that. How has your morning been so far?‚Äù</p><p>Your morning has consisted of nothing aside from nervous isolation and watching minutes tick by, but you engage with his small talk as best as you can. Fortunately this does not take long; Chris apparently has somewhere more important to be.</p><p>‚ÄúSo, here‚Äôs how we do this. You stand right here, facing this way. You see how my feet are?‚Äù Chris is standing, facing out toward the glass wall, with his feet about shoulder-width apart. You nod. ‚ÄúI count backwards from three, then I punch. I don‚Äôt expect that you‚Äôll stumble or fall over, but we can wheel in a chair in case you think you‚Äôll need it.‚Äù</p><p>You don‚Äôt know what you think. Chris isn‚Äôt a large man, exactly. Heightwise he‚Äôs just about the same as you, maybe slightly shorter. Is he younger than you are? He certainly seems to have taken better care of his skin than you have. He‚Äôs got a few athletic qualities, maybe he ran track or did rowing or something in school. You don‚Äôt know how hard he‚Äôs going to hit and, aside from that one time when you were screwing around on the playground in elementary school, you‚Äôve never actually been punched before.</p><p>‚ÄúI guess I‚Äôll have a better idea after we‚Äôve been through it once,‚Äù you respond.</p><p>‚ÄúTen-four. Like I‚Äôve said, we usually don‚Äôt dial things up to eleven here. Consistent, sustainable velocity is the name of the game.‚Äù You can‚Äôt tell if that‚Äôs some kind of project management metaphor or if he‚Äôs literally talking about punch speed. ‚ÄúOkay. Take your position.‚Äù</p><p>The two of you swap places, and you stand like he did: feet apart, looking past Chris to the cloudy sky outside.</p><p>‚ÄúAll right. You can clench your abs, if you want to. Three. Two. One.‚Äù You close your eyes and do as he suggested.</p><p><span>THWUMP.</span></p><p>It doesn‚Äôt hurt, exactly. You feel yourself losing balance before anything else. The sound follows, then the burst of confusing sensations from your abdomen as you begin to recoil. A half-step backward, and you‚Äôre standing steadily on two feet. Oh, now you‚Äôre really feeling something. A sharp radiating wave from your belly button all the way up and down your torso. You can‚Äôt breathe out to make a noise. You can‚Äôt breathe in, either. Nothing about this feels familiar.</p><p>There, in the pit of your stomach, comes something you recognize. It‚Äôs that nauseous ‚Äúbutterflies‚Äù feeling you used to get when you misbehaved as a kid and you knew consequences weren‚Äôt far behind. It‚Äôs the first and only part of this that makes sense to you. You embrace the sensation for a moment.</p><p>As if waking from an unpleasant dream, your eyes open and you remember to unclench your abdominal muscles. You‚Äôre able to let out a cough, then a gasp, followed by heavy breathing.</p><p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a pleasure,‚Äù smiles Chris as he extends a handshake. More disoriented than anything else, you reach out and meet his hand. He grips hard and jerks your arm down, up, and down. ‚ÄúSee you tomorrow.‚Äù He turns around and surges out the door.</p><p>‚ÄúSeeeouu‚Ä¶‚Äù is all you can muster. You stumble over to a gaming chair with one good armrest and collapse into it. Breathing hurts and the pain makes you retch. You can‚Äôt see anything clearly through the tears in your eyes. You are swimming through the worst pain you can ever remember experiencing.</p><p>A few agonizing moments and then it‚Äôs just sorta‚Ä¶ gone. The nausea subsides, you breathe normally, the tears recede and you snort most of the snot back up into your sinuses. Your belly is still tender to the touch, but for the most part you‚Äôre back to normal. You step out of the conference room into the bathroom to wash off your face and blow your nose properly. As you look yourself up and down in the mirror, you wouldn‚Äôt know that anything had happened.</p><p>It‚Äôs quarter after ten, and although your understanding of the arrangement is that you can now go home if you want, something about that doesn‚Äôt feel right. It‚Äôs true that you don‚Äôt have an assigned seat or team, nor do you have a specific work area, or even a computer or any <em>accounts</em> on a computer, but it still feels like you should be doing something more productive here.</p><p>You walk the outer perimeter of the floor once before arriving back at the lunch area. You examine the wall of granola bars, mint candies, single-serve cookies, and snack crackers. At this moment you have no appetite for solid food. Next to that, a refrigerated cabinet‚Äîit looks like something out of a convenience store‚Äîwith cans of juice and soda‚Ä¶ ooh, an entire shelf of Dr Pepper cans. You pull one out, crack open the tab, and take a sip. You wouldn‚Äôt have thought that carbonated sugar water would help the current situation, but it really does.</p><p>You sit down at an empty table‚Äîactually they‚Äôre all empty‚Äîand slowly enjoy the drink. You smile and wave to the people who occasionally walk by and grab a pack of gum. This part here, this isn‚Äôt so bad. You finish the can and toss it into the recycling bin. It‚Äôs not even eleven o‚Äôclock, and you genuinely have nothing else to do. Maybe you really should go home.</p><p>You walk back to Jackson and pick your coat up off the floor. You brush off the unidentified flakes it managed to collect and put it on. There is a direct path to the elevators from where you are, but you decide to go the long way past Chris‚Äôs desk to make extra sure he‚Äôs okay with this.</p><p>‚ÄúYeah, we‚Äôre good here. See you tomorrow.‚Äù</p><p>Apparently that really is the way things work around here.</p><hr><p>Tuesday morning, a few minutes before 9 a.m., sunny again. You‚Äôre back at the reception desk having a fresh visitor badge printed. At some point it‚Äôd probably be worth asking somebody when you might be able to expect a permanent badge of your own.</p><p>Seventeenth floor, walk past Chris‚Äôs desk, he‚Äôs not in yet, keep walking to Jackson. You‚Äôre a bit more prepared this time. You single out the least broken chair from the pack and wheel it into position. You drape your coat over the back of this. You have a handkerchief and a couple of premoistened towelettes in your pocket.</p><p>As you wait for Chris to arrive, you rub your hand down the front of your shirt again. Everything feels basically fine, aside from a dull ache when tensing a few of those muscles. There wasn‚Äôt even a bruise when you checked this morning, just a little residual redness. You pat yourself on the belly for no particular reason.</p><p>The office is bright this morning, with mostly clear skies outside and only the occasional patchy cloud blocking the sunlight. You glance down at your phone, looks like the rest of the week will have pretty mild temper‚Äî</p><p>‚ÄúGood morning, good morning!‚Äù Chris bursts in. You could swear you felt your ears pop from the change in the room‚Äôs barometric pressure.</p><p>‚ÄúMorning Chris. Hey, before we start, I was wondering if you could tell me who to talk to about getting an ID badge?‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúThat ticket has been submitted, don‚Äôt worry.‚Äù He unbuttons his right shirt cuff and begins rolling up his sleeve.</p><p>‚ÄúDo they need my picture or anything?‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúThey‚Äôll be in touch. Let‚Äôs go.‚Äù He beckons you to take your position. You notice he is wearing a Livestrong wristband on his freshly exposed forearm. Huh. It‚Äôs been a while since you‚Äôve seen one of those.</p><p>‚ÄúThree. Two. One.‚Äù</p><p><span>THWUMP.</span></p><p>You open your eyes wide enough to see Chris hurriedly unrolling his sleeve.</p><p>‚ÄúPleasure, as always. Gotta run to another meeting. See you tomorrow!‚Äù He waves, and you close your eyes again while grappling for the chair. It feels just like yesterday, except now you know what the progression is like. You‚Äôre incapacitated for essentially the same amount of time, but the moments do not drag quite as agonizingly as they did before.</p><p>You towel off your face, blow your nose, and head for the lunch area. Another can of Dr Pepper, another couple of minutes staring out across the busy expanse of the office. You head back to the conference room to get your coat, wheel the swivel chair back among its hobbled brethren, and take the long way out toward the exit. Chris‚Äôs desk is empty. Nobody really notices you leave.</p><hr><p>The remainder of the week is much the same. You have a fresh visitor badge printed every day. Chris always shows up thirty minutes late and has somewhere to rush off to afterwards. Even though it is literally printed on a sticker on your shirt, nobody calls your name or really even says anything more than a perfunctory ‚Äúgood morning‚Äù when they see you.</p><p>To be fair, you have barely spent any time here all week. Why should anyone know who you are?</p><p>‚ÄúThree. Two. One.‚Äù</p><p><span>THWUMP.</span></p><p>Maybe you should figure out when the different teams socialize. Hell, there are ping-pong tables (plural) here; somebody must use them for something.</p><p>Also, you probably want to start thinking about doing a little more calorie-burning exercise if you‚Äôre planning on making the Dr Pepper a daily thing.</p><hr><p>Saturday morning. You wake up naturally, having deliberately turned off your alarm clock. You‚Äôve been looking forward to the weekend because‚Äî Wait, why <em>have</em> you been looking forward to this? Over the past five days you have barely worked four hours in total, and it‚Äôs not even ‚Äúwork!‚Äù What have you been doing with the remaining 36 hours of the past workweek?</p><p>Well, alright, some of it was lost to commuting. Actually quite a lot of it was spent commuting. You live in a house out in the suburbs roughly fifteen miles north of the city. It takes a commuter rail ride, followed by a subway, and finally six blocks crosstown on foot to get from your front door to the office. It totals about 75 minutes each way, which means you‚Äôve spent‚Ä¶ Dear Lord, you suck at mental math.</p><p>You pull out the calculator and work it out. You‚Äôve spent over twelve hours commuting to this job over the past week. To be fair, you‚Äôve also spent about that much time commuting to the previous job‚Äîever since you gave up your studio apartment in the city in the search for ‚Äúmore space‚Äù and comforts like ‚Äúnot having most of your possessions ruined during the <em>multiple occasions</em> when an adjacent apartment floods.‚Äù You peer out the back window at the line of trees that the neighbor planted so she wouldn‚Äôt have to look at the ass-end of an ugly rental house. A squirrel is busy rummaging in the hollow on one of the larger tree trunks. Not gonna get something like <em>that</em> outside your big-city windows.</p><p>Still, twelve hours. You never really sat down and put a number to it before. Maybe Chris would be amicable to some kind of arrangement where you work remote. You actually laugh out loud at the idea. It makes your stomach hurt.</p><hr><p>9:30 on the dot.</p><p>‚ÄúGood morning, happy Monday!‚Äù Chris blasts into the Jackson conference room in his typical style. He‚Äôs still wearing his coat and messenger bag. Both are flung off and placed on the floor. ‚ÄúHow was your weekend?‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúOh, you know, fine I guess. Short.‚Äù You remember that it would probably be a polite thing to ask the same question of him, but that‚Äôs not where your head is at this morning. ‚ÄúChris, there‚Äôs something I‚Äôve been meaning to ask about.‚Äù</p><p>He finishes propping his coat up against the bag. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm all ears.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm having a little trouble understanding how this work fits into the broader picture.‚Äù Chris nods but says nothing. ‚ÄúYou know, like, um, who our stakeholders are.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúAh. Well, as I‚Äôm sure you know, this company has multiple verticals and business units. Some of us work on the direct-to-consumer and e-commerce products, the folks at West Campus are mainly focused on B2B operations, and every team relies on the stuff that Internal Tooling and DX puts out. So there really is no single stakeholder. Case in point, that whole half of the floor is the Next Initiative team.‚Äù Chris gestures in the approximate direction of absolutely nothing. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre working on compliance and auditing for the Information Security org.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you say <em>our</em> team was the Next Initiative?‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúNo, we‚Äôre the Next Innovation Lab. It‚Äôs actually funny, FedEx keeps leaving our packages on their side of the floor.‚Äù</p><p>You are more confused than you were five minutes ago. Chris can plainly tell.</p><p>‚ÄúLet‚Äôs double-click on that,‚Äù he thought-leads. ‚ÄúWhat insights do you feel you need in order to be more effective?‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶‚Äù You would like to bluntly ask what the damn hell any of this has to do with anything, but can find no tactful way to directly ask that. ‚ÄúI guess nothing specific. I just like to know where I fit into the whole big picture, you know?‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúI understand your desire to learn more about the business. You‚Äôre showing a lot of initiative by asking. We can figure out ways to expose you to other teams as the rollout progresses. It‚Äôs gonna be a busy Q4, just so you‚Äôre aware.‚Äù He reaches his right arm across his chest and stretches it against his left forearm. ‚ÄúYou ready?‚Äù</p><p><span>THWUMP.</span></p><hr><p>The alarm clock sounds. The sun has not technically risen yet, but the twilight streaming into the bedroom window is sufficient to allow you to do most of your morning routine without turning on the lights. It is Friday. Payday the thirteenth. The thought occurs that you could probably see the pending direct deposit from the company if you cared to look.</p><p>You care very much.</p><p>Through eyes still slightly blurred by the crust that accumulated while you slept, you open your bank‚Äôs mobile app. It nags you with a four page slideshow about some irrelevant new features added in the most recent update, then requests that you confirm your contact information and income details. You tap the ‚ÄúSkip‚Äù button. There it is: <code>ACH DEPOSIT</code>‚Ä¶ Holy hell.</p><p>You don‚Äôt need the calculator <em>or</em> your morning caffeine to comprehend that this single payment is comfortably higher than your total income over the entirety of the previous month.</p><p>Now the anxiety starts creeping in. It‚Äôs still a pending transaction; somebody‚Äôs gonna do something to keep it from settling. Even when it settles, they‚Äôre gonna find out you‚Äôre a scammer and reverse the payment. They‚Äôll probably withdraw even more as a penalty. They might even decide to sue you. There‚Äôs no reason to believe this greyed-out ledger entry is real.</p><p>You look over to the window and notice that the squirrel is still at it. Whatever‚Äôs in that tree hole has really caught its attention. The view outside helps calm your mind. You pause for a moment to appreciate the first rays of sun just beginning to filter through the branches. Of course the payment is real. You did what you were hired to do, and they paid you like they said they would. No problems here at all. Nope.</p><p>After showering, you catch a glimpse of yourself in the bathroom mirror. The area above your navel is purple to the point of almost being black. The skin, to the extent you can bear the pain of touching it, feels thick like leather. You‚Äôre not even paying attention; you‚Äôre still stressing about whether that deposit was deserved. It still feels like the whole thing is, you know, some kind of stupid fraud.</p><p><span>THWUMP.</span></p><p>‚ÄúOh, by the way,‚Äù Chris is halfway out the door, but he turns back as you crumble into the chair. ‚ÄúThe team is going to hang out after work this afternoon. Kind of an informal happy hour thing, we do it every other Friday. You‚Äôre more than welcome to come.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúSounds great,‚Äù you cough, wearily holding up your arm to give a thumbs-up. It‚Äôs likely that nobody sees the gesture.</p><p>As you regain your composure, you dimly perceive that happy hour is probably not going to begin until eight hours from now. You‚Äôre not going to commute all the way home just to come back again. Once you have finished drinking your daily dose of Dr Pepper, there is absolutely nothing for you to do here. Aside from the lunch area, PlayStation nook, and a few couches scattered around the other common areas on the floor, there are no empty desks where you could camp out. If you were to loiter in the common areas all day, you would <em>conspicuously</em> be the only person here that didn‚Äôt look like they were doing something important.</p><p>You decide to head outside and wander the city. It‚Äôs a brisk morning, not too terribly cold.</p><p>You text Doug, one of your oldest friends from the first job you had in the city. He moved across the country a few years back to chase some opportunities, but he has remained one of the few people you‚Äôve met in a work context that you really tried to maintain contact with. Despite it barely being sunrise where he lives, he texts right back. After some back-and-forth, you both reach the point where you figure it‚Äôd probably be more effective to just call each other. He dials you.</p><p>Doug has always been one of the wisest, most well-read people you knew. He could speak in paragraph form about any topic from technology to sociology using deep references and words that you were pretty sure, but not always positive, you knew the meaning of. Compared to him, you had the eloquence of an annoyed diesel mechanic. But your conversations were always insightful and enjoyable.</p><p>Not much had occurred in his life since the last time you spoke. You tell him all about your job change and the choices that led you to this point. Doug does not seem surprised at anything you shared. A few parts are met with a kind of mild bemusement, but overall he understands why a person would take a cushy job where their only contribution is getting punched in the stomach. Even more surprisingly, he has a theory about why the role exists at all:</p><blockquote><p>‚ÄúWhat is the point of a corporation, really? To sell a product, you might say. Or more descriptively, to collect revenue in exchange for delivering a product, and then to spend that revenue on products from other corporations, ideally using those products to help make their own. Also to pay for staff, who spend their wages in the even broader economy. The point of the enterprise is to make money in order to spend it, which is received by a different entity who spends it on something else. The products they make are actually <em>byproducts</em> of this system. Keeping money moving is job one.‚Äù</p></blockquote><p>You have long since lost the ability to function in your day-to-day life without using a calculator, but this sounds like plausible economic theory. Doug continues:</p><blockquote><p>‚ÄúSometimes money comes in, but the business is so large and dysfunctional that it can‚Äôt effectively direct those funds to anything relating to making the product. So what do the individual departments do? They could always hold onto the surplus, or try to give it away in dividends and bonuses. But they can‚Äôt do that too much or everybody starts getting suspicious at each other about where this sudden unexpected clump of money came from and why it wasn‚Äôt used to benefit the product. The most effective strategy on every level of the hierarchy is to simply find someplace to stuff the excess funds that looks ostensibly like it‚Äôs helping achieve a business goal even though it isn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs why so many projects run over budget and fall behind schedule before ultimately failing, yet the business survives. It‚Äôs why so many enterprise software contracts are sold despite being essentially worthless. It‚Äôs why teams become packed with specialists whose job description is to make messes, who work alongside others who are only tasked with cleaning up those same messes. These all permit a department‚Äôs budget to intentionally disappear in a way that can survive a financial audit.‚Äù</p></blockquote><p>‚ÄúSo we‚Äôre all just going through business like that <em>I Love Lucy</em> scene where they‚Äôre working at the candy factory, and they get overwhelmed by the number of pieces they have to wrap, and end up stuffing a bunch of excess chocolate down their shirts?‚Äù</p><blockquote><p>‚ÄúIn a way, yeah. That‚Äôs why the image is funny. The viewer wouldn‚Äôt have related with the characters if the situation weren‚Äôt based around some sort of shared human experience. If I remember that episode right, they didn‚Äôt even get fired did they? I think they left voluntarily at the end.‚Äù</p></blockquote><p>‚ÄúProbably, I don‚Äôt really remember.‚Äù You most likely haven‚Äôt seen that particular episode since you were a kid. ‚ÄúBut, well, okay‚Ä¶ I can accept that my company sometimes needs to make money disappear without anybody noticing so that nobody has to have an embarrassing or possibly career-damaging conversation. But why does my manager need to <em>punch</em> me to justify it? I mean, he could give me a back rub, or we could play rock-paper-scissors, or just stare each other down. Why does he <em>punch</em> me?‚Äù</p><blockquote><p>‚ÄúBecause he‚Äôs a dick.‚Äù</p></blockquote><hr><p>‚ÄúCheers!‚Äù</p><p>Everybody takes a swig from their bottle of Rolling Rock. This is one area of the business where an expense had apparently been spared. The group is circled around a ping-pong table that has been repurposed into a regular table. Chris stands at the head of it with Jon to his left. The four people who originally interviewed you‚Äîyou have since learned their names to be Dave, Davey, Lydia, and Karan‚Äîstand to his right. Chris has, more than once in the time since everybody gathered here, called them ‚ÄúDave Force,‚Äù a moniker that is visibly unwelcome. You stand near the corner at the opposite end of the table, flanked by Stef and a grown man whose given name appears to actually be JR.</p><p>You have worked very hard to learn these names over the course of the afternoon, and hope you are able to retain the information for more than five minutes. You still don‚Äôt know much about what anybody around this table actually does all day. Based purely on observations of who interacts with whom, you figure that this group must be the Next Innovation Lab and everybody else on this floor belongs to the separate Next Initiative. Possibly. Nobody has really made an effort to instill a notion of what any of this is or why any of it matters. Though maybe with some well-deployed small talk you can learn some things. You begin by simply listening:</p><p><strong>Stef:</strong> ‚Äú‚Ä¶ then I‚Äôm double-checking the sheet, and I‚Äôm going like, we‚Äôre following the capacity curve like you asked.‚Äù</p><p><strong>Jon:</strong> ‚ÄúAnd this was after the CRB approved everything?‚Äù</p><p><strong>Stef:</strong> ‚ÄúEverybody on the thread was <em>part of</em> the CRB! So I‚Äôm like, okay, let‚Äôs start from the beginning. We have two 8x-larges, and they‚Äôre like, no, we have <em>eight</em> <em>2x</em>-larges. Now I‚Äôm like, clearly one of us is having a stroke, and I ain‚Äôt the one smelling burnt toast here.‚Äù</p><p>Everybody except you laughs. You notice this and immediately put on a fake grin. As the story continues, you put together that Stef‚Äôs job is to create and configure IT infrastructure for another team. The purpose of these resources, and even whether they are used for any purpose at all, is not disclosed.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> ‚ÄúHey, Dave Force, what‚Äôs the score today?‚Äù</p><p>Four people simultaneously roll their eyes at this. Dave informally heads a team with Davey, Lydia, and Karan. Nobody knows where the name ‚ÄúDave Force‚Äù came from but they all wish it would go back to wherever that was. The ‚Äúscore‚Äù in question appears to be the number of spreadsheet rows worked through, but you‚Äôve so far been unable to suss out the broader picture. You realize you‚Äôre about due to say something, so you speak up:</p><p><strong>You:</strong> ‚ÄúSo Dave, what does the spreadsheet represent?‚Äù</p><p>Dave responds at length on behalf of his team. The short version is, they run a security auditing process. The spreadsheet contains a list of the most frequently-used passwords found in public data breaches‚Äîhundreds of thousands of them. Dave‚Äôs team divides the list up between themselves and <em>manually types the passwords</em> into one of the company‚Äôs internal tools to make sure none of the breached passwords permit access into the system.</p><p><strong>You:</strong> <em>(dumbfounded)</em> ‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶ Neat. Bet that keeps you busy.‚Äù</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> ‚ÄúThey say this group is the fastest that‚Äôs ever done it. Two years ago it would‚Äôve been basically impossible to get through ten thousand in a day.‚Äù</p><p>Did he say <em>two years?</em> And <em>ten thousand?</em></p><p><strong>Davey:</strong> ‚ÄúLydia is the real MVP, though. Nobody has ever outpaced her.‚Äù</p><p><strong>Lydia:</strong> ‚ÄúI keep telling you guys to switch to split keyboards. Or at least try one for a day.‚Äù</p><p>Lydia‚Äôs keyboard was one of the earliest things you noticed back when you first toured the office. It was split into two distinct units, each placed on the desk near one arm of the chair. Red LED lighting radiated through every gap in the plastic. Her wrists barely moved as she typed, while the movement of her fingers reminded you of the way a spider might manipulate the twitching carcass of a housefly. The keys were suspended by a heavy mechanical buckle-spring mechanism, and the loud repetitive but slightly random clicking had all the auditory appeal of a rusty Soviet tank. Her computer mouse, clearly part of a matched set, was seldom touched.</p><p><strong>Karan:</strong> ‚ÄúI tried to learn Dvorak a little bit when I was at university but‚Äî‚Äù</p><p><strong>Lydia:</strong> ‚ÄúBooo.‚Äù</p><p>Several thumbs-down are put forward. You quickly scan the group to get an informal poll of the overall sentiment and feign your own response: a disappointed head shake. Actually, part of your response is genuine; these people all seemed so competent and fulfilled when you first interviewed with them. In actuality, though, they are hollowed-out husks of what may have at one time been a spark of human potential. Shouldn‚Äôt they be <em>bothered</em>, at least a little bit, by where this life has taken them?</p><p>You‚Äôre thinking too much. There‚Äôs a lull in the conversation here, use it as another opportunity to probe somebody:</p><p><strong>You:</strong> ‚ÄúHow about you, Jon? What do they have you working on?‚Äù</p><p><strong>Jon:</strong> ‚ÄúI maintain the legacy checkpoint API. It pretty much runs on its own these days, but it‚Äôs never been formally documented. The thinking is that, whenever we get another team in place that needs to handle checkpoints again, they‚Äôll be able to hit the ground running with our in-house tech rather than having to build a solution on their own or contract out to a third party.‚Äù</p><p><strong>You:</strong> ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre documenting and supporting an API that‚Äôs‚Ä¶ abandoned?‚Äù</p><p><strong>Jon:</strong> ‚ÄúWell, I mean, <em>I‚Äôm</em> using it. Can‚Äôt very well document something if you don‚Äôt use it, you know?‚Äù</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> ‚ÄúThat API used to do, what, fifty RPS?‚Äù</p><p><strong>Jon:</strong> ‚ÄúAt least that.‚Äù</p><p>Behind you, something beeps. Several members of the group turn toward the source of the sound. It is the printer near the glass wall that looks into the Holmes conference room. JR excuses himself. He returns a moment later with a stack of at least 500 sheets of letter paper, each covered entirely in solid black ink. He hands the stack of blackened sheets to Chris, who quickly thumbs through it. He is quite pleased.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> ‚ÄúYou knocked it out of the park again, JR.‚Äù</p><p>There is likely little point in verbally acknowledging anything about what you have just witnessed. You just assume that, through some corporate razzamatazz, JR‚Äôs entire job is to waste toner. You guzzle approximately half of your beer.</p><p><strong>Jon:</strong> ‚ÄúI love doing this. Really, it‚Äôs been my dream job.‚Äù</p><p>Nobody specifically asked, but Jon eagerly volunteered this information. He turns toward Chris and continues:</p><p>‚ÄúI would still do this even if you weren‚Äôt paying me.‚Äù</p><p>There was a time in your life when you longed for such a deep connection with the work you did. Love what you do and you‚Äôll never work a day in your life, and all that. In the moment, though, you sort of feel like this is the Island of Misfit Toys and also a cult.</p><hr><p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs pretty nice, I guess. They supply free snacks and drinks, and I have some flexibility with my hours as long as I get my work done.‚Äù</p><p>You somehow hadn‚Äôt found time to talk to your parents or anybody else in your family since you switched jobs. In actuality, it‚Äôs probably taken this long to work up the nerve to talk about it openly with anyone. After every detail you share over the phone, the person at the other end of the conversation responds that the job sounds incredible. You temper that excitement:</p><p>‚ÄúYeah, but it‚Äôs a very demanding role.‚Äù And, ‚ÄúIt takes a lot out of me.‚Äù And, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think most people could do this type of work.‚Äù</p><p>You actually don‚Äôt think most people <em>would</em> do this type of work.</p><p>‚ÄúWell, just remember that you‚Äôre lucky to have a job at all. Nothing in this world is guaranteed.‚Äù Somehow this particular family member never fails to deliver her unique brand of homespun advice, that out-of-touch wisdom only attained by being thoroughly retired and never having applied for <em>any</em> job in over four decades.</p><p>It‚Äôs late Sunday afternoon. It‚Äôs actually not that late, but the sun is starting to set very early this time of year. You had always joked, when you were at the previous job, that you never got to watch the leaves change in the neighborhood because you were always gone during daylight hours. You realize that wasn‚Äôt actually a joke, it‚Äôs a plain statement of fact. Now that you get home every day around noon, you have started to appreciate how subtly the leaves can change from one day to the next. How much else have you been missing during that intervening time?</p><p>You scan the landscape through the curtains. The sunlight has gotten redder, casting low shadows that have grown longer. That squirrel is <em>still</em> rummaging around in that same hole. You lean toward the window for a closer look, the warm air from your nose fogging the terribly-insulated glass pane. That squirrel is not moving all that much, actually. You stare longer. It‚Äôs not moving at all. A calm breeze rolls its way through, and you faintly detect its bushy tail swaying lazily. You‚Äôre pretty sure‚Ä¶ nope, you‚Äôre absolutely sure: That squirrel is <em>dead.</em></p><p>You step back for a moment to briefly rub your eyes. You return to your previous position, but can no longer make out the outline of the tree you had been looking at. You must‚Äôve been thoughtlessly staring for the last 30, maybe 45 minutes. Now it‚Äôs too dark out there to really see anything. The room lights were never turned on, so you‚Äôre just standing there in the dark. You sigh. You‚Äôve been sighing a lot throughout the day.</p><p>This is not unfamiliar to you. This is something you can recall feeling countless times before under similar circumstances. Sunday is basically done and the weekend has gone with it. Tomorrow you go back to the office, back to everything you were supposed to enjoy escaping over the last two days. But you haven‚Äôt enjoyed anything, you just wasted your precious free time in the name of rest and recovery. You‚Äôve wasted pretty much every weekday afternoon in the exact same way, just standing here staring at nothing.</p><p>How was your weekend, somebody is going to ask. Short, you‚Äôre going to quip. How‚Äôs it going, it simply ‚Äúgoes‚Äù with no other characteristics. That‚Äôs the formula of the joke. None of this is a joke. <em>None of what you‚Äôve been saying to people over the course of your career has been a joke.</em> You really were upset at how little you got to enjoy the foliage on your street. You really do think that the weekend is too short to meaningfully recover from getting <em>punched in the stomach</em> every day. This feeling you are experiencing right now, <em>fuck</em>, what is this? It‚Äôs like the polar opposite of excitement and ambition. It‚Äôs that desire to curl up into a ball where nobody will ever find you. It‚Äôs the feeling of being crushed under a weight that you can‚Äôt escape, but complaining about it makes you seem weak or vulnerable, and everybody else seems to be doing just fine handling theirs, so what the hell is wrong with you? It is anger, frustration, despair, and every kind of negative energy directed at‚Ä¶ what? You can‚Äôt even say, so may as well shoulder that weight along with everything else.</p><p>This has <em>nothing</em> to do with that squirrel. No, it has <em>everything</em> to do with that squirrel. You <em>envy</em> that little prick.</p><hr><p>Monday morning, 9:30 a.m., somehow you have managed to put on your normal face and go to work.</p><p>For a company with ‚Äúunlimited‚Äù-in-air-quotes paid time off, Chris sure has a good attendance record. You‚Äôve chatted up a few people during your time spent hovering around the lunch area, and the common theme is that he‚Äôs hardly ever out sick and he only takes vacation time in a two-week block each summer. Most of the people here have similar attendance patterns; pretty much every seat is occupied more or less every day.</p><p>Say what you will about your previous job, but your old boss was out <em>a lot.</em> He had kids in two‚Äîwas it three?‚Äîdifferent schools and there was always some snafu that would cause him to miss half a day or work remotely. There was something‚Ä¶ relieving about the days when he wasn‚Äôt physically right there. He still spewed emails and instant messages and ticket comments and video calls, but the physical distance was, you know, nice.</p><p>You notice, not even a month into this engagement, that you resent the regularity with which you are forced to interact with your supervisor. ‚ÄúInteract,‚Äù hah, that‚Äôs funny for some reason. You adopt a mocking voice and quietly mutter to yourself:</p><p>‚ÄúLook at me, I interact with my subordinates by punching. Let me delegate this workload vis-√†-vis my fist. If it weren‚Äôt for those dweebs in HR I‚Äôd have a brass knuckle‚Äî‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúGood morning, happy Monday!‚Äù Chris‚Äôs inbursts made the Kool-Aid Man‚Äôs entrances seem positively genteel. You shut up real quick. ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs it going?‚Äù he asks.</p><p>‚ÄúOh, it goes.‚Äù You‚Äôre a goddamn soothsayer.</p><p>‚ÄúI hear that!‚Äù Chris says. Hearing is not the same as listening.</p><p>‚ÄúHey, Chris, I was just thinking. You probably don‚Äôt need to count down from three each time we do this. I mean, I can see your windup. I know when it‚Äôs time.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúReally?‚Äù He genuinely ponders this. ‚ÄúFantastic! That‚Äôs a super optimization. Let‚Äôs try it out right now.‚Äù</p><p><span>THWUMP.</span></p><p>‚ÄúWonderful! Incredible effort, team!‚Äù</p><p>What team? <em>What team?</em></p><hr><p>You‚Äôve spent some time at the sinks in the seventeenth floor bathroom, but this morning you‚Äôre in the stall. Sometimes‚Äînot all the time‚Äîbut sometimes, your bowels get a little scrambled during the course of your work. You‚Äôre beginning to learn that there is an upper limit to the amount of caffeine you can consume before having a bad day, digestively.</p><p>The room is tiled in maroon with yellow accents, certainly a bold color scheme. It‚Äôs also pretty dark compared to the rest of the floor; there‚Äôs zero natural light in here. The floor tiles are smooth with an almost mirror glaze. You can clearly see the reflection of the wall-mounted hand dryer underneath the stall door. It‚Äôs probably likely that a person standing in that spot could see your pitiful attempts at clenching your muscles while trying to avoid passing out from the pain. The toilet paper, much like the happy hour beer, is bountiful yet crap‚Äî</p><p>Click. The motion-activated lights turn off. The ventilation fan stops too. Now you are sitting in absolute pitch darkness and disquieting silence. You give it a moment in case your eyes find a way to adjust. They do not. You can‚Äôt see a bloody thing, and the motion sensor has no way of seeing into your stall. It does not take long for the air to grow thick and stale, the faint smell of bleach cleaners and quite a few other things beginning to reclaim the space. This bathroom has completely forgotten about you, and that‚Äôs just how it‚Äôs gonna be for a while‚Ä¶</p><p>BAM! Every muscle in your body tenses, which hurts like hell. You hear the door fly open with a force like a tornado threw a barbecue grill into it. You‚Äôd recognize Chris‚Äôs subtle touch anywhere. The overhead lights and fan turn on to greet him.</p><p>He likely doesn‚Äôt know anybody else is in here with him. If he did, he would‚Äôve tried to initiate small talk by now. You try to remain very still so he doesn‚Äôt detect your presence. This is a rare opportunity to observe a creature‚Äôs natural behavior, you may as well accept the good fortune. From the urinals, vaguely melodic groaning would be the most clinical way to describe it. Yeah, that‚Äôs definitely him. He spends his whole bathroom visit just‚Ä¶ humming. He steps back, the urinal flushes automatically, and he darts out of the bathroom as briskly as he had entered. He does not wash his hands.</p><p>You wait a moment to make sure he‚Äôs really gone, then relax with a sigh. The toilet that you are sitting on flushes itself. That‚Äôs the third time it has done this since you‚Äôve been in here.</p><hr><p>‚ÄúHow about cleaning up a crime scene?‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúYou mean like wiping up blood and brains and shit like that? Ew, no. Wouldn‚Äôt do that either.‚Äù</p><p>On this weeknight, you‚Äôre seated in a corner booth at a bar with four other people you know from outside of work. You are the slowest drinker in the group, now just about two glasses into the evening. The rest of the party is quite a bit further ahead in the race to inebriated serenity. The conversation has taken an organic turn to the topic of jobs that nobody wants to do. Prior to the crime scene cleaner, there had been ‚Äúbathing patients in hospice care,‚Äù ‚Äúslaughtering pigs,‚Äù ‚Äúemptying portable toilets,‚Äù and, oddly enough, ‚Äúroofing.‚Äù Nobody in the group would do any of those hypothetical jobs for any amount of hypothetical money.</p><p>Yet, those are all real jobs done every day by real people. They‚Äôre important jobs that keep society running the way we have grown accustomed to. Nobody in the group wants to stick their arm shoulder-deep into a clogged sewer pipe, and nobody wants to ride through the July noon in a festering garbage truck, but countless people do those things every day. People who, in the majority of cases, probably take home less money than any of the people sitting around this table.</p><p>‚ÄúHow about getting punched in the stomach?‚Äù you propose. The table falls silent as each person pauses to make sure they heard you right.</p><p>‚ÄúWhat, like a boxer or something?‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúNo. Just like walking in, getting punched in the stomach, and leaving.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see how that‚Äôs a job,‚Äù the second-most sober person in the group argues. You can‚Äôt fault her assessment.</p><p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm seriously asking. You get punched in the stomach, and they pay you‚Ä¶‚Äù You round your total compensation to the nearest hundred thousand and reveal the number. The table goes into deathly quiet consideration.</p><p>‚ÄúShit, for that much they can spit in my mouth and break my fingers too,‚Äù the drunkest member of the group exclaims. His words, delivered with a barely detectable slur, suggest that he hasn‚Äôt given this question even the slightest bit of actual consideration. Nobody else has anything to add. It was a weird question and you are a weird person for having brought it up.</p><p>You fidget with your glass, which has about two sips worth of drink left in it. You really don‚Äôt feel like finishing that now.</p><hr><p>The train is unusually crowded on its way into the city this morning. You had received a transit alert on your phone earlier regarding problems due to an equipment breakdown a few stops away, but that has since been cleared up. This looks to be the residual overflow of people who couldn‚Äôt make it onto an earlier train.</p><p>Your phone dings again, this time with an email on your work account. While they haven‚Äôt given you a desk, or a badge, or really anything to make you feel any shred of belonging, they did eventually give you an email account along with a strong hint that you should check it regularly using your personal devices. It‚Äôs not your favorite thing to have had to do, put it that way.</p><p>It is a notification email from the company kudos board. Chris has bestowed you a unit of ‚Äúleadership and initiative‚Äù praise in a two-sentence text box: ‚Äúconsistently delivers strategic value and innovative process optimization. the most reliably creative problem-solver we‚Äôve ever punched in the stomach.‚Äù Other employees can add their own digital reactions to the message in the form of a smiling face emoji. So far only JR has elected to do this.</p><p>These kudo boards‚Äîkudos board?‚Äîthey really serve no purpose other than to ostensibly boost morale. Honestly, you find them so cloying and infantilizing that you‚Äôd rather not receive any praise on the platform at all. It‚Äôs kind of embarrassing to show up in those emails. And it‚Äôs not like you get any kind of tangible monetary award or additional consideration out of racking these things up; they‚Äôre completely pointless. Well, okay, maybe they may factor in some small way into the annual performance review process and that makes them, well, still largely pointless. You had once heard it mentioned‚Äîand maybe it was a joke or maybe it was sincere‚Äîthat the company unofficially considers a person‚Äôs employment to be a success if they make it to the two-year mark. That suggests to you that plenty of people flame out well before that milestone. From where you sit, it‚Äôs perfectly clear how a person might not last even half as long in that environment.</p><p>You have a partially-eaten breakfast sandwich in your other hand and return your attention to that. You enjoy a few bites while staring out the window at the passing houses. It‚Äôs kinda funny, even when the train is running normally you don‚Äôt usually get the seat near‚Äî</p><p>Panic. Throat. There is something seriously wrong in your throat. Whatever you just tried to swallow didn‚Äôt do the thing it was supposed to do. Cough. Gasp. Swallow. Swallow. Swallow. You‚Äôre not actually <em>doing</em> any of these things, your body is following some kind of autonomous routine. Lean forward. Retch. Cough. You feel the glob of whatever rise to the back of your mouth, and you hack it onto the floor. You‚Äôre breathing heavily now, but at least you‚Äôre breathing. Tears, seemingly from nowhere, pour from your eyes.</p><p><em>What the hell was that?</em></p><hr><p>‚ÄúHere you go.‚Äù Chris hands you a grey folder. You open it. Performance review time. You‚Äôve barely been here for two months, but apparently the cycle waits for nobody. ‚ÄúIf you could get that back to me by this time tomorrow, that‚Äôd be perfect. We‚Äôre trying to get all of you some more mon-ayyy.‚Äù He could‚Äôve said ‚Äòmoney‚Äô like an adult, but we all make our choices in life.</p><p><span>THWUMP.</span></p><p>The performance review paperwork consists of a ‚Äúhow would you rate yourself‚Äù chart on topics like punctuality, knowledge, communication, and so forth. Anybody who doesn‚Äôt give themselves a healthy and self-aggrandizing mix of fours and fives has either an inferiority complex or a stupidity complex. Still, you want to at least give the appearance of playing the game, so you give yourself a three on leadership.</p><p>The rest of the document is a whole bunch of open-ended blank space talking about goals. Each goal needs to be SMART‚Äîspecific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. This has been the same at basically every company you‚Äôve ever worked at, and over the years they‚Äôve thoroughly beaten the system into your brain. ‚ÄúSpecific‚Äù goals leave no room for interpretation; you say what you are going to do and there is a clear way to determine whether that happened. ‚ÄúMeasurable‚Äù goals have to have a number in there somewhere. An ‚Äúachievable‚Äù goal, you would think that‚Äôs common sense‚Äîno point committing to something that is impossible to do. ‚ÄúRelevant‚Äù goals have direct relation to whatever the business‚Äôs needs are‚Ä¶ or whatever you are paid to do in the case that these concepts do not overlap. A ‚Äútime-bound‚Äù goal has another number in it, the date by which you will do that thing. By default, the assumption is it will be done by the next performance review at the latest.</p><p>This framework perhaps makes sense for an assembly line worker who performs a predictable and repeatable task and wants to see an incremental improvement. It also works for fields like sales (make <em>X</em> number of sales pitches and close <em>Y</em> number of deals) and even doctors (treat <em>X</em> number of patients and kill fewer than <em>Y</em> of them in the process). These are fields where this system might actually provide some benefit.</p><p>Even when you worked at a real job, you found this process pointlessly difficult as an individual contributor doing what they call ‚Äúknowledge work.‚Äù You have never really been empowered to make decisions that could change the outcomes of any goals you might set for yourself. Put simply, your goal at all times is to do whatever the boss tells you to do, try not to screw any of it up, actually finish it, and don‚Äôt complain. None of that fits into the little SMART cubby holes they have carved out here.</p><p>You put yourself in the shoes of JR or one of the members of Dave Force (it‚Äôs a dumb, dumb name but boy it‚Äôs convenient). JR could write a goal that states he‚Äôd print a total of half a million solid black pages over the upcoming fiscal year. With the possible exception of ‚Äúrelevance‚Äù to anything resembling sane corporate decision-making, that‚Äôs a perfectly serviceable goal. He‚Äôs probably well on the way to shattering it right this moment. Same with Dave Force‚Äîperhaps a member of that team could commit to work through a hundred thousand passwords by the end of Q4. Another adequate goal.</p><p>The problem with memorializing this stuff in a long-lived document is that <em>things change.</em> At this moment, yes, everybody can extrapolate what they‚Äôre doing right now and predict what a reasonably ambitious vision of the future might look like. But Chris could swoop in at any time with new organizational whims that interfere with, halt, or even reverse course on work being done today. Somebody might leave the company, resulting in the remaining staff getting reassigned to cover that work instead of making progress toward their goal. JR might be instructed to stop the printing project, and instead begin pouring hand soap directly down the sink drain. Even <em>you</em> have no guarantee that ‚Äúget punched in the stomach 250 times over the next calendar year‚Äù is a stable north star.</p><p>When the next performance review cycle comes around, these old goals get dredged up and compared against how reality shook out. A good manager might go ‚ÄúWell, I see what you were going for and you were well on your way, but circumstances changed and I can sorta morph one into the other‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre fine.‚Äù A less good manager might say ‚ÄúBZZZZT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT.‚Äù Either way, you have to figure out how to artfully contrive 250 punches into <em>more than one goal</em> on this worthless sheet.</p><p>Actually, no, don‚Äôt say 250. Fudge that down to give yourself some wiggle room for sick days and stuff. 225 sounds about right.</p><p>Huh, you did that one without a calculator.</p><p>You roll the folder and its contents up into a tight tube and slip it into your inside coat pocket. The rigid paper uncurls as soon as you loosen your grip and an asymmetrical lump forms next to the zipper. There is still no desk, storage area, or any kind of spot to stash this until tomorrow; you‚Äôll have to bring it home and back with you for no good reason.</p><p>In the lunch area, you can‚Äôt help but notice that the refrigerated cabinet is starting to look barren. Actually, no, for the most part it‚Äôs about as well-stocked as it‚Äôs ever been. Same with the wall of snacks. It‚Äôs really just the shelf where you have been sourcing Dr Pepper cans from. You crouch down and move your head through a few different vantage points. There are four cans in there. Scratch that‚Äîyou open the door and pull one can out‚Äîthere are three.</p><p>You know for a fact that people on this floor are consuming beverages from this thing. You can see probably half a dozen desks where somebody is currently doing exactly that. Strangely, though, you can‚Äôt recall ever once seeing somebody else drinking Dr Pepper. It‚Äôs quite possible that you drank the entire shelf on your own.</p><p>You are neither proud nor bothered by that idea. You pull the tab and crack open the can.</p><hr><p>‚ÄúMorning Val! I‚Äôll have the usual.‚Äù</p><p>Valerie smiles and shakes her head. It has been well over eight weeks since you started here, meaning at least forty visitor passes have been printed by the front desk receptionists. Every member of the team recognizes you now, but you‚Äôve developed an affinity for Val. She was the one who sassed you about the elevators during your first visit. Over the course of a few successive interactions, she started to take pity on you and your badgeless status.</p><p>The conversations never run anywhere near one minute apiece, but you‚Äôve discovered a bit about each other. You‚Äôve learned that she and the rest of the receptionists really don‚Äôt care about their work at all. All they really have to make sure they do is prevent the whackjobs and lunatics from getting to the elevators, and to press the emergency button if anybody gets out of hand.</p><p>She knows what you do at the company. She hardly batted an eye when you first told her that you get punched in the stomach professionally. ‚ÄúA lot of people who come through here do that,‚Äù she said at the time. She was the only person in this building that gave the impression that she knew what was really up and how things really were. It was refreshing to have a person to whom you could say, ‚ÄúThis whole thing is actually just bullshit, right?‚Äù and find agreement.</p><p>‚ÄúKnock ‚Äôem dead, champ.‚Äù She presents your visitor badge, and you peel it away from the tip of her index finger.</p><p><span>THWUMP.</span></p><hr><p>It‚Äôs another dreary afternoon. Rain. This time you ended up in the back seat of the car, leaving the passenger side window as the only interesting view to be found. There‚Äôs not much out there: Slick roads reflecting light, trees in the distance, slower cars being passed. You‚Äôve taken this ride enough times that it‚Äôs basically routine at this point. There is no need for conversation or any kind of interaction with the scene. All it takes is time.</p><p>You would think by now that you would have more of an intuition about where specifically you are in the journey between point A and point B. It never really seemed like a pressing need. On the few times you‚Äôve tried, the street signs were too far away to make out. It‚Äôs not helped by the fact that it always ends up being too foggy and grey out there to see much of anything.</p><p>You turn your eyes briefly to the left. The other rear seat is still empty. It‚Äôs starting to look like that time again. You lean up to take a peek over the front seatbacks, which are quite a bit higher than you remember them being before. Passenger seat, empty. Driver‚Äôs seat, also empty.</p><p>As you lie awake in bed, replaying this most recent dream to yourself for the who-knows-how-manyth time, you marvel at how predictably routine it has become. Sometimes you begin in the front seat, other times you make it behind the wheel only to discover that the brake pedal really doesn‚Äôt do anything. It isn‚Äôt a nightmare, and it isn‚Äôt even very upsetting anymore. It‚Äôs just sorta <em>there</em>, like a movie without sound playing in the back of an airplane headrest that commands no attention. You‚Äôve read somewhere that most attempts at dream analysis are essentially quackery, but you‚Äôre pretty sure this one is an unambiguous insight into your subconscious mind.</p><p>You‚Äôre awake anyway, so may as well take this opportunity to use the bathroom. It‚Äôs nearly 4 a.m. and you can still get two solid hours of peaceful sleep if you‚Äôre lucky. You allow the sink to run for a few seconds before putting your hands in to avoid the slap of ice water that has lain in the cold plumbing. As you wait, a look in the mirror. You noticed your first grey hair a few years back, but up until this moment you had never seen one <em>there</em> before. You squint and move closer to the mirror. Yup, now that has a grey hair too.</p><p>You lay on your right side to no avail. You lift the sheets and comforter, turn to lay on your back, and wait that amount of time again. You roll to your left side. The bedside clock says 4:41. You‚Äôre thinking about, well, nothing exactly. You‚Äôre sure there‚Äôs some kind of parade of thoughts running through your mind, but you haven‚Äôt been paying attention to it. All you‚Äôve focused on is that feeling. That helpless, hopeless sense that you really are destined to be this way forever. And it‚Äôs not just that you‚Äôre stuck in this job and bound up in the sprawling root system that it has driven deep into your soul. No, you‚Äôre trapped in this cold night, in this dark room, staring at a stopped clock in perpetual misery.</p><p>Whatever this job has given you‚Äîand to be crystal clear it has given you most of the down payment on a house‚Äîit is <em>not enough</em> to offset this sense of constant dread. Whatever you have given to this job, certainly things that cannot ever be quantified on a bank statement, there are now pieces of yourself that are missing. Pieces you didn‚Äôt even realize were being given away. Pieces that, in this moment, <em>you worry you might never get back.</em></p><p>This is a bad deal. This is a self-destructive situation. They are going to use you up and then incinerate whatever is left of your desiccated body to pay a fat bonus to some who-knows for achieving some who-cares. Whatever Jon and the rest of those people feel about coming to work, <em>they are wrong.</em> Or at least they are willing to trade away any last remaining shreds of mental health more readily than you are.</p><p>What was the plan here? Why did you leave a perfectly sustainable‚Äîif difficult and slightly unrewarding‚Äîjob to do this crap? What even <em>is</em> this crap? You are, and let‚Äôs not mince words here, you are a <em>thief.</em> That‚Äôs the only way to make sense of this situation: You are stealing money from somebody, somehow. This is money you have not earned. There is no legitimate way that you should be receiving any form of compensation for simply <em>absorbing abuse.</em> These people, maybe the whole company but certainly the people in your immediate management chain, are irredeemably damaged to be using human beings that way. They will take, and take, and smile at you like they‚Äôre doing you some kind of favor, and maybe throw you a little perk from time to time to distract you from thinking about it too hard. But you? You can‚Äôt stop thinking.</p><p>You can‚Äôt stop thinking.</p><p>4:44.</p><p>You can‚Äôt stop thinking.</p><hr><p>How are you here right now? How did you delude yourself into coming here this morning?</p><p><span>THWUMP.</span></p><p>‚ÄúOh, by the way, I‚Äôve got your finalized performance review here. Do you have some bandwidth right now?‚Äù Chris is in good spirits, and acting like this is a regular interaction between two regular people. It seems to not bother him that he is addressing your half-passed-out panting body. You weakly wave your hand in a gesture somewhere between ‚Äúthumbs-up‚Äù and ‚Äúyeah, so what.‚Äù He rustles some papers, then summarizes:</p><p>‚ÄúSince you‚Äôve been here less than a year, we don‚Äôt have any existing goals that we can retro. But I remain seriously impressed at your commitment to improving process. And I want to be crisp here:‚Äù</p><p>God how you have grown to despise this man.</p><p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm talking specifically about how we‚Äôre able to punch more effectively without the countdown now. Some of the guys on the other floors can‚Äôt believe that it‚Äôs sustainable, but the velocity numbers don‚Äôt lie. So, we are going to be giving you the full cost of living increase plus five percent, effective Monday the first. From all of us, we‚Äôre really glad you‚Äôre here.‚Äù</p><p>You have not opened your eyes once during that entire exchange. You hear and understand the words and the broader implication, but it does not produce any response. You feel Chris wrap his hand around yours, squeeze unnecessarily, and impart a rattling businessman‚Äôs-type handshake. He releases his grip and your hand flops back down.</p><p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a pleasure, see you tomorrow.‚Äù</p><p>You soon recover enough physical and spiritual energy to sit up in the chair. Chris has left the performance review folder on your lap, still obviously curled from its round trip in your coat pocket. You skim the cover page looking for the numbers. You think, well, maybe you can hold out a little while longer to maximize your gains. You know, in the moment, it‚Äôs not so bad. Maybe, just for a bit‚Ä¶</p><p>You get up and walk straight to the bathroom to wash the Chris off your hand. You clear your throat to find something acrid and viscous rising up from your chest. You clear your throat again and swallow hard. You could swear you hear an audible click at the bottom of your neck. You‚Äôve been popping antacids every day to try to tamp that down, but it hasn‚Äôt had much of an effect.</p><p>Fortunately, this company really seems to understand what its employees need, and part of the snack shelf in the lunch area is dedicated to stomach pills and digestive remedies. You‚Äôve stopped grabbing Dr Pepper from the fridge and have replaced it with famotidine tablets in your daily routine. That shelf has been empty and untouched ever since the morning you removed the final can, anyway. There‚Äôs a bunch of other stuff in there, mostly flavored seltzer and stuff that‚Äôs a little too <em>frou-frou</em> for your taste. You originally thought that maybe you‚Äôd gain weight from the arrangement‚Äîeach one of those cans added about 150 calories to a diet and lifestyle that wasn‚Äôt accustomed to such a thing. Yet strangely, the opposite has happened and you have been losing weight reliably, even when you were still on the sugar water. You pop two tablets and swallow, they go down with substantial difficulty. Even with the bland chalky taste of berry-laced chemicals, nothing improves.</p><hr><p>You have known for a while that something was going on, ever since you choked and‚Ä¶ Well, you can‚Äôt even call what happened ‚Äúchoking‚Äù really. The doctor called it ‚Äúdysphagia‚Äù‚Äîhe was very clear that this was a symptom and not a disease by itself‚Äîthe underlying cause could have been a range of things, anything from ‚Äúshrug‚Äù to ‚Äúhm, interesting.‚Äù In the time since then you have become acutely aware of the act of swallowing. You notice every hitch, every motion, every sequence of muscle contractions between the back of your mouth all the way down to the middle of your chest. You have no ability to control any of these events‚Äîit still remains a largely autonomous thing‚Äîbut the initial kick-off step, where the food leaves that fully controlled gate at the back of the tongue and tumbles into the great unknown, has become very difficult to control.</p><p>You compensate by taking smaller bites, chewing more thoroughly, deliberately shaping things with your tongue in an effort to line it up in a way that goes down more smoothly. It does not work. You‚Äôve learned that you have no trouble swallowing liquids, and if you take a pill-sized bite of food you can sneak it down with a sip of water. Eating this way takes approximately forever.</p><p>You adapt to this by taking smaller portions, or taking food to-go when dining out, but the main factor remains water. Each bite of food comes with a splash of water, which really fills you up in terms of volume but not nutrition. Some of your meals have run for so long that you need to excuse yourself to the bathroom to eliminate some of the excess water midway through.</p><p>You‚Äôre simply not eating enough. Your pants are getting loose. That one well-worn hole in your belt goes right past your waistline now, and you‚Äôre wearing down a fresh new hole. On top of that, you are <em>scared</em> during every meal. You can‚Äôt eat without an ample supply of water within reach. You become anxious if the level of water in the glass drops much below the halfway mark. You ask the waitstaff in restaurants to bring multiple glasses right from the get-go.</p><p>You don‚Äôt even know what you‚Äôre scared of. Since that original incident on the train, nothing like that has ever come close to happening again. And yet, you have become incapable of enjoying even so much as a cookie without having a glass of water in your other hand. You don‚Äôt eat much around guests anymore. You weigh less than you did when you graduated high school, yet the BMI charts all say ‚Äúhealthy weight, great job!‚Äù based on your height. This does not feel healthy.</p><p>You‚Äôve started trying to avoid looking at yourself in the full-length mirror. You don‚Äôt feel fit, and you certainly don‚Äôt look it either. The only word you can think of to describe yourself is ‚Äúscrawny.‚Äù Scrawny with a dark, thick, leathered welt down the whole center of your abdomen. You‚Äôve attained the chiseled physique of a Roswell Grey.</p><p>You run your employer-sponsored health plan through its paces. They stick cameras up your nose and down your throat. Your dentist wants you to start wearing a bite guard due to evidence that you‚Äôre grinding your teeth while you sleep. A team of radiologists bombards you with a lifetime‚Äôs worth of X-rays to produce a live video of your neck while swallowing. All of the sample material is the consistency of pudding, which you call out as not being the kind of thing that you‚Äôve been having trouble with. They don‚Äôt have anything firmer that contains enough barium to show up on the scan, and surprise surprise, the symptom does not occur under these conditions.</p><p>The prevailing theory is that, due to the demands of your occupation, you are experiencing acid reflux that is damaging your esophagus. They prescribe a whirlwind tour of unpleasantly large and equally ineffective pills with names like esomeprazole and lansoprazole, names that you feel you shouldn‚Äôt need to know at this early stage of your adulthood. No improvement comes.</p><p>During a routine checkup, you find yourself interacting with a doctor you‚Äôve never met before. He was a last-minute substitution due to some scheduling issue with your usual doctor. He scans your medical record and remarks:</p><p>‚ÄúSeems like they‚Äôve been running you through the wringer. Tell me about your problem.‚Äù You do. He inquires a bit into the nature of your work, and he can plainly tell that it is destroying you from the inside.</p><p>‚ÄúLet‚Äôs try something here.‚Äù He starts clicking around on his wall-mounted computer. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to prescribe an antidepressant and an anti-anxiety medication. Start taking those, and let‚Äôs follow up in a few weeks.‚Äù</p><p>You had always been under the impression that such things required the detailed analysis of a psychiatrist or something, maybe with a bunch of questionnaires and electrodes and wires coming out of your head. But no, evidently a regular general practitioner can just <em>do that</em> if they feel the need to.</p><p>You ask him to explain his reasoning, even though you‚Äôre pretty sure you already understand the gist of it. It‚Äôs not that getting punched in the stomach is making you sick. Getting punched in the stomach is causing <em>emotional problems</em>, and those moods and feelings are causing the physical symptoms. You had never even once considered approaching the problem from that angle before. It was like somebody slapped your head and called you a dipshit, in a clinical sort of way.</p><p>You fill the prescription and, with the help of a little bit of water, take your medicine.</p><hr><p>‚ÄúHey Val, um‚Ä¶‚Äù</p><p>You‚Äôve been taking the pills for a few weeks now and are definitely noticing changes in your behavior. The part of your brain that tells you ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ask that, it‚Äôs uncomfortable/inappropriate/weird/impolite‚Ä¶‚Äù is still there. Noticeably absent, however, is the part of your brain that heeds those warnings. You continue:</p><p>‚ÄúHave you ever been on antidepressants?‚Äù</p><p>Val stops typing and glances up at you for a moment, then looks back down.</p><p>‚ÄúYeah, I used to be. At the old job.‚Äù</p><p>You are vaguely aware of Val‚Äôs work history, although you‚Äôve never gotten into specific details with her. She did graphic design and production for the advertising arm of one of those companies somewhere east of midtown. She never once expressed a fondness for that work or a desire to return to it.</p><p>‚ÄúMost of us were,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúPeople can‚Äôt survive that environment without help. A bunch of the people behind you are probably on them. Or they oughta be.‚Äù</p><p>You turn halfway around to look over your shoulder. A larger than usual clump of people has formed behind the turnstiles. Somebody is being a slowpoke finding their badge and that‚Äôs clearly irritating a dozen people behind them. You catch yourself staring at the scene, fixated, wanting to watch the show to see how it ultimately plays out, but, nah. You turn back.</p><p>‚ÄúWhy‚Äôd you stop?‚Äù you inquire.</p><p>‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt like the side effects,‚Äù she said with an expert curtness that you‚Äôve grown to admire. The visitor badge rises from the printer and she peels off the backing. You can tell that this is the absolute limit to her willingness to elaborate on the subject. She has shared very little, but more than enough.</p><p>‚ÄúYou know, I don‚Äôt think I do either.‚Äù You take the badge, fold it in half such that it will never stick to anything again, and stuff it into your pants pocket.</p><hr><p>As far as you can remember, you have never felt impatience at this job. The sense of impending dread you‚Äôve experienced during your time spent in the Jackson conference room‚Äînow serving as the home for a large stack of flattened cardboard boxes in addition to the growing fleet of damaged gaming chairs‚Äî<em>who keeps breaking all these chairs?</em>‚Äîhas never once been superseded by any other emotion or feeling. Until today, right this minute. Now you‚Äôre just impatient. Irritated. Why do you still get here so early? Chris has never once punched you before 9:30. You could probably roll in anytime you want. What an inconsiderate asshole.</p><p>‚ÄúGood morning, good morning!‚Äù Whatever. Get it over with.</p><p>‚ÄúQuick question: Has anybody talked to you about Eddie?‚Äù Chris asks.</p><p><em>Who in God‚Äôs name is Eddie?</em></p><p>‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt think so.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúAh, okay. Well, Eddie has decided to pursue other opportunities. He‚Äôll be leaving us after Friday, and we‚Äôre going to do a little sendoff during happy hour.‚Äù</p><p>You pick up on the hint. You used to come to every happy hour religiously‚Ä¶ for a while. After four or five of them, you started attending less reliably. You found it increasingly difficult to come up with ways to pass eight hours of a workday out in the city, especially now that it‚Äôs freezing cold most days. You haven‚Äôt been to any of them in weeks. If you want to still keep up the appearance of a team player, you‚Äôll probably want to go to this one. And who knows, maybe some of the attendees will be more willing to show an authentic part of themselves for once.</p><p>‚ÄúSounds great,‚Äù you parrot.</p><p>Your mind is somewhere else, yet nowhere in particular. Normally you‚Äôd be trying to psych yourself up at this time, but this morning you‚Äôre just kind of drifting through things. Chris rolls up his right sleeve as he has done a hundred times before. Wait, is it actually one hundred? Or more than that at this point? Let‚Äôs see‚Ä¶</p><p>Your attention is pulled back to something new and unfamiliar. Chris has started rolling up his <em>left</em> sleeve as well. A large Apple Watch‚Äîmaybe the largest and most gaudy one they sell, but honestly you never paid much attention to their product line‚Äîloosely jingles on its stainless steel band. He doesn‚Äôt just slide the sleeve up; this is a careful process of folding the cuff over itself, inches by inches, up the arm. The roll stops once it clears his elbow, resting loosely at the base of his bicep. As he moves his arms your eyes find something even more unexpected: a blackwork tattoo on the outside of his left forearm. It looks like a flower petal, but there‚Äôs also a solid bar‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs a Celtic cross. A large rose. A vine with thorns wrapping around the whole piece.</p><p>You‚Äôre surprised, or at least your brain has responded with the thought of ‚Äúthat is a surprising thing to be seeing at the present moment.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúUnfortunately, we‚Äôre all going to have to hustle a little bit in the short term to make up for his departure. So it‚Äôs not just you, we‚Äôre all making sacrifices.‚Äù He winds his fist way, <em>way</em> back. This seems, uh‚Ä¶ different. You clench your eyes shut.</p><p><span>THWUMP.</span></p><p>Whoa, falling backwards. You step back to catch yourself, it‚Äôs not enough. Another step, still not enough. You feel as though you are tumbling end-over-end while the ground shifts beneath your feet. Another step, now your back has made solid contact with the wall. You stop trying to move, appreciating this single moment of stable proprioception. You slide down the wall and come to a rest in the crouched position. You wrap your arms around your legs and just squeeze for all you‚Äôre worth.</p><p>You‚Äôve managed to get through most of your life without really studying the inside of your eyelids. Like, how could a person do that in the first place? They‚Äôre just covers that turn everything black, or in brighter circumstances, a kind of blood red that really ought to be more unsettling than it is. You‚Äôve recently started doing it, or at least attempting to. The longer you stare at the blackness before you, the less black it appears. It‚Äôs now a very deep maroon, basically purple, although still not very bright. It‚Äôs not a color you often see in the waking world; anything putting off such a darkened hue would look black by comparison. Maybe it‚Äôs a color you could find in a darkened room under ultraviolet light, that‚Äôs the closest comparison you can conjure up.</p><p>On the fringe of this purple field, a ring of greenish yellow emerges. It too is dim but intense, a color that would not be well loved in the real world but which nicely complements the purple here. The yellow ring expands inward, pushing the purple into a shrinking spot that eventually disappears at the center of your field of view. Now a fully yellow scene, a purple ring begins forming at the edges of your periphery and slowly sweeps away the yellow in the same way. Then the yellow ring again, then purple. The cycle repeats for as long as you want it to. It‚Äôs soothing, reminding you of a screen saver that no longer has much practical use on modern computer displays. If you bothered to count the rings, maybe you could use their oscillations as a kind of crude stopwatch.</p><p>You take a deep breath, open your eyes, and stand up. It is nearly 10:30 now.</p><hr><p>‚ÄúCheers!‚Äù</p><p>You really don‚Äôt want to be here. This entire evening has been dedicated to listening to people recount completely unrelatable stories about a person you have never seen before. What did Eddie <em>do</em> here? Why does everybody seem so genuinely enamored with this man? How have your paths never crossed in the entire time you‚Äôve been here?</p><p>You finish another bottle of Rolling Rock, choosing to temporarily disregard the medical advice to limit alcohol intake while on antidepressants. You figure that, as long as your mouth is busy drinking beer, nobody will expect any thoughts or opinions to come out of it. For the most part, it looks like people have forgotten you are even here.</p><p>You slip away from the group for a few minutes and take a meandering stroll around the seventeenth floor. It was dark outside when this happy hour started, and the office looks starkly different in the absence of daylight. All of the conference rooms are dark except for Aikman‚Äîyou can‚Äôt recall a single time when the lights in Aikman had been turned off, occupied or not. You count two other people on the floor, both of whom are working studiously while trying to tune out the noise from the members of the Next Innovation Lab. You continue on to the PlayStation nook. It occurs to you that you‚Äôve never actually seen anybody make use of this area. Does the system work?</p><p>You switch on the large television screen and it lights up with a pattern of alternating solid pink and white bars. Several thin horizontal lines appear as well, all intersecting at a large asymmetrical black splotch near the center-left of the screen. You pick up the controller and press a few of the buttons. They collapse under your fingertips, suggesting that none of them work correctly anymore. You flip the controller over and notice that the rear of the case is cracked down the middle, separating from the top. The other controllers are similarly damaged. As are the game discs. <em>Who keeps breaking all this stuff?</em></p><p>You complete your circle around the floor, concluding that you have been here long enough to have ingratiated yourself to this group‚Äîat least enough to make it to the next person‚Äôs resignation. You pause to take a look out the window. There is now a pelting sleet visible around the streetlights below. You briefly consider staying a bit longer to wait it out, but no.</p><p>‚ÄúHey, don‚Äôt hike through that,‚Äù Chris scolds. ‚ÄúHere, call a taxi.‚Äù He lifts a stack of papers on his desk with one hand and plucks a business card from the pile with the other. ‚ÄúYou can expense it.‚Äù You squint to read the phone number. It is the city‚Äôs area code, followed by seven identical occurrences of a digit.</p><p>You dial the number with some difficulty; you have lost track of exactly how many drinks you‚Äôve finished but it is certainly more than you‚Äôve had in a long time. The dispatcher at the other end identifies themselves as a ‚Äúluxury car service.‚Äù You tell them where you are and where you‚Äôre going, and they give you an estimated pickup time a few minutes from now. You wave goodbye to the few people who notice you beginning to bundle up, and you slip into an elevator.</p><p>There is only one person at the reception desk at this hour, an elderly man you haven‚Äôt seen before. You exchange goodnights. Through the heavy glass doors, made heavier by the howling wind, you find the large Lincoln sedan with its patiently-waiting driver. A total of perhaps fifteen seconds in the pounding elements, and you are inside the warm vehicle.</p><p>The back seat of this car is simultaneously luxurious but also kind of shabby. The upholstery is well-worn and every surface that could accumulate scratches from jewelry and attach√© cases has done so. It smells strongly like cologne and cigars, and you‚Äôre pretty sure a determined person could shake a couple dollars worth of cocaine out of the floor mats.</p><p>But here you are, adequately intoxicated, looking through the clouded-up passenger side window at slick roads, reflected lights, trees. A line of slower cars in the right lane falls away as you roll onward. You almost never navigate this part of the city by surface streets, and have no idea where you are in relation to your house. None of the passing road signs are legible through the mist and fog. You sit and continue to stare out the window, at light and shadow, and at nothing in particular.</p><p>‚ÄúSir?‚Äù</p><p>You snap awake. The car is parked.</p><p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre here.‚Äù</p><p>You look out the window and see your front yard. The driver reaches down and produces a miniature tablet computer with a credit card reader. He taps the screen a few times and hands it over his shoulder. You take it and review the contents of the screen. This is, by no small margin, the most expensive cab ride you have ever taken. You wince a little, swipe your credit card, and select the middle tip amount of the three suggested.</p><p><em>‚ÄúYou can expense it.‚Äù</em></p><hr><p>One of the things that they tell you you‚Äôre supposed to do, assuming you‚Äôre a responsible adult, is to buy life insurance. You followed that advice a few months into your marriage, and aside from the inconvenience of having to submit the annual premium payment‚Äî<em>why doesn‚Äôt this company support auto-pay?</em>‚Äîyou haven‚Äôt thought much about it in years. You don‚Äôt even remember the specifics about what the policy provides for, should it ever pay out.</p><p>You ponder this while looking out the window into the backyard. There‚Äôs a good chance that the last occurrence of <em>really bleak</em> winter weather is behind you, and the plants look like they‚Äôre ready to spring to life any day now. You follow the tree trunk up to the hollow that you have studied well. Some time in the last week or two, the tail of that dead squirrel finally came detached. Whether this happened through a natural process or if it was assisted by some kind of scavenger, you can‚Äôt say for sure. Actually, both of those options are each kind of natural in their way.</p><p>In your bedroom closet, in the top drawer of a cheap filing cabinet, a hanging file folder with an orange tab holds some answers. You pull out the cover sheet of the policy and scan it for numbers. Once you locate a calculator, you divide a six-digit number by a two-digit one, yielding a rather unimpressive five-digit quotient. Hm.</p><p>You try to retroactively justify why you just did that. There is no sequence of events where that money belongs to you. It‚Äôs for the benefit of those who outlive you. Or, in a purely actuarial sense, more probably to benefit a family you‚Äôll never meet in their time of tragedy and unimaginable grief. You hope.</p><p>Is this number an independent assessment on your value as a person? Well, no, this was mainly a function of how much you were willing to part with each summer when the insurance premium payment was due. It could‚Äôve been much higher, or much lower. It doesn‚Äôt mean anything. What are you trying to achieve here?</p><p>You put the sheet back and flip through the other folders in the drawer. You quickly find what you‚Äôre after: the pages of material that the pharmacist gave you the first time you filled your prescriptions. Nausea, agitation, aggression, unusually grand ideas, ah, there it is, ‚Äúnew or increased thoughts of death or dying.‚Äù Mystery solved, then.</p><p>To clear your head, you do something pointless and look Eddie up on LinkedIn. You‚Äôve sort of lived by a rule that you don‚Äôt connect with anybody you currently work with, in case something you post or adjust within your profile on that wretched site grabs the attention of somebody in the office. Much like accidentally leaving an updated copy of your r√©sum√© in the shared printer‚Äôs output tray, that‚Äôs how rumors get started. Eddie though, he‚Äôs become inert. Nothing you do or say in front of him would likely make it back to your employer, as it‚Äôs quite likely that Eddie might never talk to any of the people you work with again. You click ‚ÄúConnect.‚Äù</p><p>The screen fills with the profile pictures and names of your current coworkers. With a single click, this machine has learned much about you and your social fabric. You sign out without acknowledging a single one of its fresh suggestions.</p><hr><p>‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no clip? Or lanyard?‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúWhat, do you think we‚Äôre made of money?‚Äù Val quips dryly.</p><p>It really does feel cheap. The company name, followed by a picture of your face, followed by your name in stark uppercase, followed by the company name again. The printing is fuzzy, looking like something out of a late 90s inkjet in draft quality mode.</p><p>You had pretty much given up on reminding anybody that you were never given an ID badge. You‚Äôre not sure if Val or anybody on the reception team specifically went to bat for you, but the end result is irrefutable: You have a real badge now, and you can let yourself into the place at will. Never mind the fact that the picture makes you look like a person who had recently been punched in both eyes. You flip it over; the back is solid white.</p><p>‚ÄúWell, I guess this is the end.‚Äù As you speak the words, you truly can‚Äôt tell if you mean the sentiment that such a phrase would typically convey. The only reason you talked to the receptionists at all is because you needed them to let you into the building. With this badge, that need is gone. But these people‚Äîspecifically Val, who you have tried to get whenever the dynamics of the visitor line permitted you to‚Äîwere the only ones in this building who still seemed to retain their humanity. What little you‚Äôve spoken, probably a handful of minutes over the course of months, has contained some of the most cathartic and genuine conversation you‚Äôve had in years.</p><p>You do mean it, you decide.</p><p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll survive,‚Äù she answers. She most likely means it too.</p><p>You bring your new badge to your forehead and mime the action of tipping your hat. Val gives a small wave, and you leave for the turnstiles.</p><p>You had imagined, once or twice, what it might be like to do this by yourself. To tap your badge, become enveloped in a green glow and have a pair of person-sized frosted glass panes yield to make way for you and you alone. As you draw nearer, the feelings of pride and belonging don‚Äôt really come. It‚Äôs just a gate, you do this all the time in the subway. The only difference here is that it doesn‚Äôt smell so strongly of paint and urine.</p><p>You tap your badge. Nothing happens. Is it already damaged? Is somebody playing a trick on you? <em>Are you fired?</em></p><p>Beep. Green. ‚ÄúCar 1.‚Äù The glass panes slide into their housings, presenting an unimpeded path to the rest of your day. You make sure to pause and make a mental note of this in case you want to try to feel something about it at some future time. You step forward.</p><p>BUZZ. As you pass to the other side, the lights turn red and the gates quickly close. The turnstile has decided, incorrectly in this case, that a tailgater has followed you through the gate without properly identifying themselves. The appropriate response would be one where you briskly walk away so nobody has a chance to figure out which idiot couldn‚Äôt use the turnstile properly. You, though, you stop and turn around to look toward the reception desk. Nobody has bothered to look up to see what the problem was. You can‚Äôt see Val through the crowd, but you feel like, somehow, she knows you were the one who did that.</p><p><span>THWUMP.</span></p><p>‚ÄúOh, by the way,‚Äù Chris adds. ‚ÄúI had to reject that expense reimbursement for the car service last week. We can only approve travel if it‚Äôs with companies on our approved vendor list, plus you would‚Äôve needed to get the approval upfront in order to expense that much in the first place.‚Äù</p><hr><p>You tap your credit card to the reader and collect your purchases. They don‚Äôt offer shopping bags to those who check out with such a small number of items, and you won‚Äôt need one anyway. You step out through the automatic sliding doors into the fresh air. It‚Äôs unseasonably warm this afternoon, the first short-sleeve shirt day of the new year.</p><p>This has become something of a regular spot for you. It‚Äôs the convenience store attached to the gas station down the street from your house. You‚Äôve been refilling your car here for years but had never gone inside prior to a few weeks ago. You‚Äôve developed an afternoon walking routine, with the first stop coinciding with a visit to this store. Each time you pass by, you buy a snack or some kind of on-the-go meal to consume as you walk. Today you are leaving with a one-pound bag of Nacho Cheese Bugles and a ‚ÄúPepperoni ‚Äôn Cheese‚Äù Slim Jim. You eat the Slim Jim immediately and discard the wrapper in the parking lot trash bin. The Bugles, you will eat over the course of the next hour as you wander through the streets of the residential neighborhood on this side of the main road.</p><p>Remarkably, you do not have a beverage today. After consistently taking the medication you have been prescribed, the swallowing issues have effectively disappeared. You have since learned that you could bring them back, along with the sour feeling in your throat, by ingesting too much caffeine in too short a time. Intentional focused worrying can also make it recur. With that aspect of your life now thoroughly controlled, you have turned into an eating machine. You can clear a plate and go back for a second helping twice as big. You crave random flavors‚Äîthings you have not eaten in years‚Äîand willingly give into those desires. Over the course of the first half of this one-hour walk, you eat the entire bag of Bugles.</p><p>Your weight has recently started increasing, although after the deficit you were in you figure you‚Äôve got a ways to go before you need to start disciplining yourself out of this behavior. For the time being, though, this just feels‚Ä¶ huh. This just feels <em>blank.</em> What goes in that blank. You roll the empty bag up and slide it into your pants pocket.</p><p>You are still pondering this question. You feel as though‚Ä¶ you don‚Äôt feel. That‚Äôs basically the only way to make sense of it.</p><p>You have the dumbest epiphany. Antidepressants don‚Äôt make you happy. Anti-anxiety pills don‚Äôt bring calmness. This cocktail of medications is simply making you not-depressed and not-anxious. They don‚Äôt produce the opposite emotions to fill the newly-created void. Or, at least, they haven‚Äôt for you. It‚Äôs true that you‚Äôre not anxious, and that‚Äôs had a measurable positive impact on your ability to <em>consume nutrients</em>. And you‚Äôre not sad either, which has clearly improved your willingness to‚Ä¶ oh.</p><p>You almost managed to get all the way through this walk without your thoughts drifting back to your job.</p><hr><p>You didn‚Äôt tell anyone you had stopped doing it, you just stopped. ‚ÄúChanges in thinking or mood‚Äù was going to be your justification if anybody asked. Every thirty days, as instructed, you‚Äôd go to the pharmacy and pick up your prescriptions. The copay, five dollars each and every time you go, presumably in place to dissuade people from wasting resources by doing exactly this. You put each bottle on the shelf in the cabinet without ever opening it. You probably should‚Äôve made a note to record exactly when you stopped taking your medication, but oh well.</p><p>The first emotion to come back was fear. A very nonspecific, wide fear about nothing you can quite put your finger on. It manifests itself as a persistent unwanted thought whenever you try to concentrate on something. Today, it is the interrupting notion that there is going to be a loud sound. Maybe a shelf is going to fall down, or the smoke detector is going to start blaring, or the kid down the street is going to deliberately make his car backfire, <em>or the entire second floor of this house is going to collapse on you.</em> Expect that sound. Anticipate that sound. Don‚Äôt freak out when it happens. It‚Äôs <em>going to happen.</em> Just don‚Äôt freak out when it happens.</p><p>According to WebMD, this is PTSD. Of course, according to WebMD you also have testicular torsion and a mild autism diagnosis.</p><p>The other emotions slowly start to come back too, particularly anger. That, combined with despair, forms the building blocks for frustration and before long you are swimming through your old brain chemistry again. Fortunately the dysphagia does not return. You have learned how to eat without overthinking, and that lesson seems to have stuck. You‚Äôre not quite as hungry for random junk food anymore, although you do still partake. The Chipotle queso in particular, setting aside the fact that the price strikes you as a total ripoff for what it actually is, brings such immense joy that you want to shoot it straight into your veins.</p><hr><p>‚ÄúSo what do you do again?‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúWhat <em>don‚Äôt</em> I do, am I right?‚Äù You deflect as best you can, but you‚Äôve never mastered the art of weaseling out of conversations with your in-laws. The joke does not land; a genuine answer is expected here. ‚ÄúWell, it gets complicated.‚Äù</p><p>You decide in the moment to explain what you did in your previous job, since that at least sounded like an honorable thing for a person to devote their career to. Without directly intending to, you color your words using the emotions that you carry about the current job. You describe a dysfunctional morass of idiots all pulling in different directions while somehow collectively bumbling themselves farther away from anything that could meaningfully improve anybody‚Äôs lives. You tell of ignorance, malice, arrogance, avarice, possibly touching on most of the seven deadly sins in a single sentence. As you conclude, he is both stunned and horrified. Perhaps you could‚Äôve phrased it more gently. Oh well, maybe he‚Äôll avoid talking to you for the rest of this dinner.</p><p>You rearrange the food on your plate. Meat down here next to the knife, mashed potatoes packed without touching anything else, green beans at the opposite edge. All lined up like a little log raft. You know, WebMD might be onto something with that autism idea.</p><p>You‚Äôre back to thinking about work again. You‚Äôve learned to compartmentalize a bit, or maybe you‚Äôve just trained yourself to try very hard to avoid all thought of the subject except for when you‚Äôre required to. Sometimes that fails, though, like when a family member unwittingly brings up a subject they don‚Äôt realize to be touchy.</p><p>You start to wonder what you might write down on your r√©sum√© to account for the time you‚Äôre spending here. You can‚Äôt just say you ‚Äúadopted workflows to increase punch preparedness by 300% while adapting to dynamic business needs‚Äù or whatever; there aren‚Äôt enough buzzwords in this type of work to get you back to the kind of job you had before. Maybe you could leave it off, call it a sabbatical or something. Perhaps you worked at a startup that failed, or wrote a book that‚Äôs not yet published, or contracted for some super-secret entity that you can‚Äôt reveal but it was <em>totally</em> using the same tech stack that the job you‚Äôre applying to does.</p><p>You look up and briefly stare into middle distance. The last time you thought about doing all that, it was clearly time to leave that job.</p><hr><p>It would not be inaccurate to say that each day has been worse than the last.</p><p><span>THWUMP.</span></p><p>You have completely driven away any delusion that this is the kind of life that a person should live.</p><p><span>THWUMP.</span></p><p>There is enough money in your savings account to live, albeit miserly, for a few years without working at all.</p><p><span>THWUMP.</span></p><p>Setting aside the paycheck, there is nothing here that you will remotely miss or ever attempt to rekindle to further your future career aspirations.</p><p><span>THWUMP.</span></p><p>You find that you don‚Äôt even care what happens anymore. You have transcended sadness and rode that feeling all the way past hopelessness, depression, simple cynicism, and have arrived in a place so utterly devoid of meaning that you have at one point idly considered what might happen if you cut both of Chris‚Äôs arms off with a band saw. You conclude that it would probably take much longer than you would prefer, and the whole ‚Äúslip away under the cover of darkness‚Äù thing requires a lot of careful planning and you still don‚Äôt have the energy or discipline for that. So, no, not really an option here.</p><p><span>THWUMP.</span></p><hr><p>Friday, May first. The weather has become reliably nice almost every day, and even your worst moods have improved recently‚Äînot always by much‚Äîbut improved a little by spending time outdoors. It‚Äôs a bit after 7:00 a.m. and the sun has been up in that cloudless sky for almost two hours. You, along with a hundred or so nearby residents, stand on the raised platform next to the train tracks. It is about five minutes before the next scheduled departure, and this train has a reasonably good track record of being on time.</p><p>Soon you will all crowd onto the train, grapple for seats, and wait patiently for the conductor to check each ticket and stick a seat check marker under the clip in front of you. You will ride the train to its terminus, whereupon you will enter a separate transit system that will carry you into the heart of midtown. Day after day this system operates at or near capacity, its systoles carrying life-sustaining nourishment to the vital organs and other viscera that form the city‚Äôs economy.</p><p>Back while you were doing the old job, you had to endure two instances of the commuter rush every day. Now it‚Äôs just this one in the morning. Riding home during the mid-morning hour is cake; frequently you‚Äôll have an entire half of the train car all to yourself.</p><p>That‚Äôs not what you‚Äôre thinking about this morning, however. You can‚Äôt quite decide what you‚Äôre thinking about. You look past the tracks into the parking lot of the dollar store that abuts the transit system property. At the top of a light pole, a mockingbird delivers a breathlessly complicated series of squawks and chitters. If you had even the slightest bit of experience with bird song, maybe you‚Äôd have more of an opinion on the accuracy of its mimicry. Its sounds combine with, and then are drowned out by, the rhythmic striking of a bell. A bit faster than once per second: Ding. Ding. Ding.</p><p>From your left, the train approaches the station platform. At this time of day the locomotive is at the rear of the configuration, pushing the cars ahead of it. Where you stand, toward the south end of the platform, the passenger cars roll quietly along. The loudest sound is the squeal and hiss of the air brakes as the train comes to a halt. The mockingbird flies away in response to that particular noise.</p><p>Individually, each passenger begins to move toward whichever door stopped closest to their position. A few old pros have long since determined exactly where to stand so they don‚Äôt have to move at all. From a distance, a na√Øve observer might assume that there was some grand choreography to this dance, but no. Everybody is simply following their own path of least resistance.</p><p>The doors open and the conductor‚Äôs voice scratches through the speakers, saying nothing intelligible or particularly important. Well, <em>almost</em> all the doors open. The door in front of your group has remained closed, and appears to be out of order. The group collectively realizes this and targets the next-nearest door to the left. Your group merges into the existing crowd already at that door, producing a mass of maybe thirty people all trying to board at that position.</p><p>A half-step toward the door. Then a pause until more space opens up. Half-step. Pause. You notice that everybody around you has continued in this fashion, but you have not. You‚Äôre just standing there. People are walking around you and filling the space you had previously inhabited. You are just a rock in the middle of this flowing stream, a minor obstacle to navigate and, given enough time, erode into silt.</p><p>You watch the last person in your group step up onto the train, turn toward the aisle, then leave your view. The doors close a moment later, and the train begins to move. You count the doors that pass by your position‚Äîeleven of them, you‚Äôre pretty sure. It doesn‚Äôt really matter which one anybody picks; they‚Äôre all going to the same place. The locomotive passes next, with its engine loud enough to be felt and its diesel exhaust pungent enough to be tasted. The train rounds a curve to the right of where you are standing and fades into a memory.</p><p>A handful of people exited that train, and they all made their way down the stairs and past the station building. You are still standing in that spot and you are now the only person still on the platform. <em>What is this?</em> Is this what a nervous breakdown feels like? Is that what‚Äôs going on here? What are you going to do? Catch the next train? What‚Äôs gonna happen? Does it matter? Have you decided to just stand here all day?</p><p>For a moment, yes, you do simply stand there. You begin to look around more freely at the passing traffic, the birds on the station‚Äôs roof, the little flowers on the shrubs near the garbage cans, and the bees that are attracted to one or both of those things. You inhale sharply and let the breath back out. You turn to the left and start walking.</p><p>The area immediately outside the train station is well known to you. In addition to the dollar store, there is also a pharmacy, a grocery store, a half dozen small restaurants, and a bank branch. You‚Äôve run plenty of errands here over the years. Strangely, though, you‚Äôve rarely had a need to venture north. You are aware of one excellent hole-in-the-wall Mexican restaurant in that direction, roughly halfway between this station and the next one up the line, but that is the extent of your geographic knowledge of that town and everything beyond it.</p><p>You‚Äôre walking on the sidewalk of a residential boulevard that runs parallel to the train tracks. Your direction of travel, broadly, is north‚Äî‚Äúaway‚Äù from the city. The streets bend and split and rejoin in curious ways, but you make sure to keep the tracks in sight to maintain your heading. One foot in front of the other, carrying nothing but the untucked button-down work shirt on your back.</p><p>In this moment, it does not bother you that you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre doing or why you‚Äôre doing it.</p><p>One of the first things you do before getting far is to set your phone to airplane mode. You have no intention of calling in sick or letting anybody know where you went. If they knew, they would probably try to pull you back from it. No, this is a path to be walked alone. Untethered. Man, stop thinking about that and enjoy the scenery.</p><p>Look left, no traffic. Look right, no traffic. You cross against the light.</p><p>You‚Äôre pretty sure that the train stations up on this part of the line are fairly evenly spaced. You try to mentally replay the list of station names that they prattle over the public address system every day. Best you can recall, there are nine in total. You‚Äôve just passed the second one.</p><p>The sun is <em>just a wee bit</em> much. If you had planned for this excursion, maybe you would‚Äôve applied sunscreen or brought a hat along. It‚Äôs not insurmountable, and you continue on. You have not even broken a sweat.</p><p>You look down at your watch. On a normal day at this time you‚Äôd be waiting for Chris to storm through the door into Jackson. Prior to today, you‚Äôve somehow never missed a day. Neither has he. There‚Äôs a first time for everything.</p><p>Up ahead, something unpleasant: The entrance ramp to a cloverleaf interchange connecting this road to one of the numbered state highways. You‚Äôve made it your life‚Äôs mission to never have to drive on this highway, and you‚Äôll be damned if you‚Äôre going to try to cross it as a pedestrian. You stop and look around. On the other side of the street is a bus stop with a small printed map of the immediate area. You jaywalk there and inspect it. If you backtrack about three blocks, take a left, continue around the park‚Ä¶ Yeah, that seems survivable.</p><p>You reverse course, turn, and cross the highway at an underpass. As you crest the hill, a comforting sign rises into view: Burger King. Ah, what the hell. It‚Äôs here, and you‚Äôre hungry enough for it.</p><p>For each chain restaurant that you visit with any kind of frequency, you‚Äôve developed an order that has become your go-to for that establishment. A known amount of food for a known price that will leave you in a predictable state. Even this location in a borough you‚Äôve never been to, with its cracked asphalt parking lot looking sad next to a bustling four-lane highway, could reasonably be expected to get the meal right.</p><p>They do, and it satisfies. Maybe it wasn‚Äôt the smartest thing you could‚Äôve eaten given the day‚Äôs activities, but, well‚Ä¶ Nothing you‚Äôve done today was smart. On the way out, you refill your ‚Äúmedium‚Äù-size cup‚Äîthe name is misleading; their medium cups hold damn near a full liter‚Äîwith Dr Pepper. It‚Äôs free, technically.</p><p>You take your drink to go and rejoin the sidewalk that would‚Äôve taken you around the outside perimeter of the park. You realize that, as a pedestrian, you can cut across. At the geometric center of this park sits a large duck pond with a series of floating fountains to churn up the water. A ring of benches surrounds it. The area is not exactly deserted, but at quarter to noon on a weekday it makes sense that attendance would be low. You take a seat on one of the benches, a respite that you don‚Äôt really require considering you just sat for twenty minutes eating a bacon cheeseburger meal. You close your eyes and listen. From here, you can‚Äôt make out the constant hum of the highway. You don‚Äôt smell car exhaust or garbage cans. Even the air feels perfectly still.</p><p>You examine the inside of your eyelids. You‚Äôre met with a full field of moderate-intensity red. There is no purple or yellow, no rings subsuming one another. Nothing moves. Nothing captures your attention. There is nothing in there that needs to be examined further. You open your eyes into a squint to give your pupils time to fully adjust. This is a nice spot. Maybe someday it‚Äôd be worth figuring out how to get back to this place.</p><p>You notice your right leg has started shaking up and down. You‚Äôre getting antsy sitting around. It‚Äôs probably time to go. You take a deep swig from your drink, stand up, and continue on your original course.</p><hr><p><em>‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the craziest thing you‚Äôve ever done?‚Äù</em></p><p>A crushed and dirty plastic bottle sits in the middle of the sidewalk, and you kick it toward a utility pole. You miss. The craziest thing you‚Äôve ever done; where did <em>that</em> thought come from? Ah well, may as well engage with it.</p><p>When people ask things like that, they‚Äôre looking for juicy yet largely relatable stories of youthful indiscretion. You know, getting real drunk, riding a mechanical bull, getting a dumbass rose‚Äìand‚ÄìCeltic cross tattoo, things that might more appropriately be called ‚Äúspontaneous‚Äù or ‚Äúfree-spirited.‚Äù Experiences you could package up in a neat little box, present to the person asking the question, and move on. Skydiving, swimming with great white sharks, having one real good night at a poker table, those sorts of things.</p><p>You always had difficulty producing memories like that. You never really engaged in behaviors that fit into the formula that‚Äôs expected. If anything, you were more of an instigator or an idea guy. (‚ÄúHey, Ryan! Betcha can‚Äôt drive all the way through the Taco Bell drive-through in reverse!‚Äù The son-of-a-gun actually did it, and he succeeded on the first try. The employees were apparently not paid enough to notice.) It feels somehow inauthentic to share those stories as if they were your own experiences. You‚Äôve always been just a tiny whisper of chaos in somebody else‚Äôs ear.</p><p>So what is the craziest thing you‚Äôve ever done? You‚Äôve stopped walking to ponder this question.</p><p>It‚Äôs this. This right here.</p><p>Walking all the way out here‚Äîwho knows how far it‚Äôs been but you‚Äôve been at it for almost six hours‚Äîis likely the craziest thing you‚Äôve ever done, for some definition of ‚Äúcrazy.‚Äù That‚Äôs already starting to tread dangerous waters, because it conflates impromptu foolishness with people suffering from genuine mental health disorders. There‚Äôs probably some segment of the population for whom those two descriptions overlap nicely, but that‚Äôs a damn hard needle to thread.</p><p>You ruminate and decide that ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù implies something that is more self-destructive than it really needs to be, something which ought to have been recognized as a bad idea by the person or persons involved. But then, there‚Äôs some wiggle room. In what way is it really self-destructive to skydive or swim with sharks, assuming of course that you survive the experiences? You suppose that over-reliance on chance is part of the equation as well.</p><p>‚ÄúCrazy‚Äù is walking with only a vague sense of direction toward an undefined target, belting out an old Reel Big Fish song in a confident singing voice that you have never once let another living soul hear.</p><p>Wait, no. ‚ÄúCrazy‚Äù is randomly getting strung along at a job you never wanted and only took because <em>it was there.</em> ‚ÄúCrazy‚Äù is taking both hands off the steering wheel in order to just ‚Äúsee what happens.‚Äù It‚Äôs everything you‚Äôve been doing for the last eight months.</p><hr><p>You expected to see a sign or something. Maybe it would have an ornate patch of landscaping around it, and the name of their narcissist governor to round it all out. Apparently they only do that on the interstate highways. When you cross a state line on foot, there‚Äôs very little fanfare. Aside from an abrupt change in the composition of the asphalt and the degree of workmanship demonstrated by the adjoining counties in repairing their potholes, very little has actually changed.</p><p>Through some series of events in the nineteenth century, the final station on this commuter rail line was built half a mile past the border of a neighboring state. You are now in that state, and will soon reach that station. It is the figurative but also quite literal end of the line. This is the last opportunity you‚Äôll have to conveniently get yourself back home by train.</p><p>You‚Äôve come to the conclusion that you‚Äôve done whatever it was you set out to do. You have no idea what you accomplished and you‚Äôve gained nothing tangible from it, but you have done <em>something.</em> You step into the air-conditioned building and buy a one-way ticket to your home station. You study the large map on the wall. In the corner is a scale legend, which helps you estimate that you have walked about fifteen miles to get to this place. It doesn‚Äôt really feel like it; you <em>could</em> keep going if you wanted to. You just don‚Äôt feel compelled to go any farther than this.</p><p>The timetable says that you‚Äôve got about forty minutes here before the next train leaves. It will get you home before 5 p.m. and the ensuing Friday night rush. You find a bench outside in a shady spot and sit down. It feels good to rest your legs. As you slowly allow yourself to be drawn back into your regular thoughts and the responsibilities they represent, a mixture of guilt and apprehension beckons you to wake your phone from airplane mode. You do so, and a number of notifications appear in no particular order. One very specific notification grabs your attention: an email from Chris.</p><p>You assume that an unexcused absence‚Äîor, call it what it is, you skipped work‚Äîwould be viewed unfavorably. Maybe he reached out to see if you were still alive. Maybe he took your lack of response as a signal of distress and then proceeded to send the cavalry to come to your aid. Perhaps he simply fired you. These are all fine outcomes, you conclude. You open the email:</p><blockquote><p>gentlemen,</p></blockquote><p>It should be noted at this time that at least two of the people in the <em>To:</em> field of this message are women.</p><p>Chris has never once capitalized anything in any written medium. You find his commitment to the style somewhat impressive, given how difficult this is to do in our current era of predictive text and auto-correction. There was a time when you yourself typed everything that way, but the difference is that <em>you</em> were fourteen years old and trying to be ‚Äúedgy‚Äù while writing comments on a fan-run message board about <em>The Simpsons</em>, and <em>he</em> is a supervising manager at a multinational corporation.</p><blockquote><p>due to personal circumstance, i will be ooo today.<br>reachable on email.<br>chris</p><p>Sent from my iPhone</p></blockquote><p>Well. Seems like maybe you managed to get away with something.</p><hr><p>‚ÄúReal sorry about missing you on Friday,‚Äù Chris offers while rushing through the door into Jackson.</p><p>He does not know that you are not at all sorry that you did not miss him.</p><p>The building‚Äôs security logs more than likely keep a record of each time an employee badges in. For all you know this information probably gets analyzed and funneled into the performance review metrics every cycle. But you‚Äôre also pretty sure that Chris doesn‚Äôt know you ever got a badge in the first place. He remains completely oblivious to the little interlude you took last week.</p><p>‚ÄúNo worries,‚Äù you say.</p><p>‚ÄúGreat. Well, we have to keep up the velocity here, and now we‚Äôre behind a day. If you‚Äôve got the bandwidth for it, I‚Äôd like to pull a quick recovery here and punch you twice.‚Äù</p><p>Was that a question? Is he looking for you to sign off on the idea? Do you even have a voice in the matter?</p><p>Your non-answer did not matter, as Chris indeed did not ask a question. His sleeves are rolled up. His cable knit sweater, a muted shade of puke, stands in stark contrast to the primal virility pent up in his tensed arm muscles. He winds up. Your eyes are still open. You never really get to see this part.</p><p>His fist begins to move forward. Then to your right. It kind of looks like he is going to miss hitting you entirely.</p><p>You transfer your full weight to your left foot and begin to lift your right foot. You only now realize that you have just sidestepped Chris‚Äôs punch completely. This catches him off guard as well, and he takes an awkward half-step forward to maintain his balance. You both come to rest.</p><p>‚ÄúDid you just dodge that punch?‚Äù Chris asks in a tone so surprised and lacking in confidence that it sounded like somebody else asked.</p><p>‚ÄúI, um‚Ä¶ I did.‚Äù</p><p>Chris looks at you for a good long while. He unrolls his sleeves.</p><p>‚ÄúI expected better from you.‚Äù</p><p>He turns around and exits slowly. There is no empty farewell, no gust of wind, no swinging door. He retreats quietly into the din of regular business on the seventeenth floor. You stand there for a moment, thinking maybe he just wanted to regroup before coming back to really tear into you, but he does not return.</p><p>You choose the longer path to the elevators, trying to maintain the greatest possible distance from Chris‚Äôs desk. You pass the wall of displays, with their dashboards and graphs. You had never really spent much time studying them to make sense of the various acronyms and business concepts, but you get the distinct impression that the numbers are a lot more‚Ä¶ red? Did these graphs always trend downward like that?</p><hr><p>The invitation email contained no other context. 9:30 a.m., one-on-one between you and Chris, in the Aikman conference room.</p><p>Whatever adjectives you might use to describe Jackson, Aikman is the exact opposite. Glass-walled on three sides with two entrance doors, housing a table so massive that you assume they put it there first and then built the rest of the room around it. The space contains enough Polycom microphones that it is probably sensitive enough to read your thoughts. The single opaque wall supports a display screen too large to fit in <em>anybody‚Äôs</em> living room, which is currently showing a clock superimposed over a photograph of a serene lagoon on some Pacific island paradise. The clock reads 9:24, and you‚Äôre quite sure of its sub-second accuracy.</p><p>In your time here, you‚Äôve seen this room get plenty of use. Usually it‚Äôs inhabited by folks who are dressed up a little nicer than the average worker on this floor. Ties and blouses, that kind of look. It‚Äôs seldom used by anybody you recognize, instead hosting groups of people who come straight from the elevators and who return back there promptly when the meeting is done. You don‚Äôt know how many Aikman-class conference rooms there are in this building, but this one certainly draws a crowd. You, however, have never once set foot in here prior to this morning.</p><p>It seems a little silly to have a one-on-one in such a large space, but this is Chris‚Äôs show. You are seated in the chair directly next to the head of the table. The head position has a large console to control the display and room lighting, a set of responsibilities you want nothing to do with. To your right are at least nine other chairs, all neatly pushed in against the table. The people from Facilities apparently devote special attention to keeping this room clean and tidy. From your position at the table, you can see clear from the elevators over to the aisle where your team sits.</p><p>You see Chris emerge from the elevator before he sees you. Your eyes meet through the glass wall, and you acknowledge each other‚Äôs presence. You peek at the clock on the large display. 9:29.</p><p>Chris heaves the door open. The room is large enough that you don‚Äôt feel this one.</p><p>‚ÄúGood morning,‚Äù he says coldly.</p><p>He walks around the table as if he is targeting the head seat. Upon reaching that spot, he reaches over the back of the chair and presses a button on the console. In an instant, the glass walls of the room turn a solid milky white. You have never once seen the room in this state‚Äîyou weren‚Äôt even aware that materials science had created a type of glass that could do that. Whatever happens in here, only the two of you are going to see.</p><p>Chris pulls back the chair directly opposite you and sits down. The seat at the head of the table remains undisturbed, perhaps reserved for Business Elijah.</p><p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure I don‚Äôt need to explain the reason for this meeting. Frankly, I‚Äôm more than a little disappointed in your performance as of late. When we went ahead with your merit boost during the last review cycle, we were rewarding your commitment to going above and beyond and we expected that same level of commitment going forward. It really seems as though you have begun to let the ball drop on multiple fronts here.‚Äù</p><p>You find it incredibly difficult to maintain eye contact during situations like this, so you focus your gaze on the top of his ear instead. There is, perhaps, six feet of table separating the two of you, so it is hard to see much detail. But you‚Äôre pretty sure‚Ä¶ Yes, it looks like he‚Äôs got some grey on his temple.</p><p>‚ÄúAnd this goes beyond velocity issues and following through with tasks. This is about how you are perceived by your peers. Whether you realize it or not, you are one of the more senior members of this team and a number of the lower-leveled ICs look up to you and model their attitudes after yours. They can tell when you‚Äôre, you know, going through motions, and they pick up on that energy and take it to heart.‚Äù</p><p>You have since switched to looking at his other ear. That temple has some grey too.</p><p>‚ÄúAs it stands right now, we need three punches‚Äî<em>at least</em>‚Äîto break even here. Along with a serious attitude adjustment. I‚Äôm willing to help you work out a plan for how we can move forward and rectify this. And if you need some time to think it over, I can be a little flexible. But you‚Äôve got to let me know where your head is at here.‚Äù</p><p>You nod, take a slow breath, and glance down at the brutally beige carpet. ‚ÄúNo need to wait, I‚Äôm ready now.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôm all ears.‚Äù Chris folds his hands and leans forward. You‚Äôre staring at those hands now.</p><p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm done. I quit.‚Äù</p><p>Chris unfolds his hands and places them flat on the table. He sits back in his chair again. ‚ÄúUnderstood. Well I‚Äôm sorry to hear that.‚Äù</p><p>You reach into your pants pocket to try to find your ID badge. It is difficult to do in a seated position. ‚ÄúYeah, well.‚Äù You pull the badge out and toss it onto the table. It lands face-down, slides until it contacts a nearby puck mic, and stops.</p><p>‚ÄúIs this resignation effective immediately?‚Äù Chris double-checks.</p><p>‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúAlright. We‚Äôre really sorry to see you go. It‚Äôs been a pleasure and, yeah, we‚Äôre done here.‚Äù He stands up, presses the button to unfrost the glass wall, and exits. You stand up, carefully roll your chair back to the position where you originally found it, and walk around the table to the opposite door. Surely somebody from Facilities will straighten up the other chair and do something with your badge.</p><p>As the elevator doors close, you have a fleeting thought: After all these years of working, throughout all of the different companies and managers, you‚Äôve still never actually been <em>fired.</em> This one seemed close, though.</p><p>You thought maybe you‚Äôd tell Val about what just happened. But as you near the reception desk, you notice she isn‚Äôt there. There are four receptionists you recognize‚Äîeven though you don‚Äôt really know any of them very well‚Äîand one new guy working Val‚Äôs position. Thinking back, you can‚Äôt actually remember the last time you saw her over there. Was it, hmm, maybe three weeks ago? The day of the big rainstorm, where you slipped and almost fell on the marble and she mimed a golf clap.</p><p>As you approach the main doors, you briefly look back at this grand lobby that you‚Äôll probably never set foot in again. It‚Äôs been a long time since you really paused to take it all in. ‚ÄúOpulent‚Äù‚Äîin the most negative possible connotation of the word‚Äîreally is the only way to describe it. And right there, in the middle of the scene and thirty feet in the air, one of the massive overhead lights has burned out. As you step out into the unseasonably high humidity, part of you idly wonders if‚Äîin some cosmic way‚Äîit was Chris‚Äôs punches that had been keeping it lit.</p><p>You pull your phone out during the train ride home and notice the warning: ‚ÄúFailed to download new messages, incorrect username or password.‚Äù Whatever they lack in new hire orientations, they more than make up for with offboarding.</p><hr><p>You spend the next few weeks trying to disentangle your personal life from your former employer. Your first order of business is to get yourself added onto the health insurance plan at your spouse‚Äôs job. You were also required to close out your employer-sponsored brokerage account, which holds a zero balance because you did not stay the full twelve months and none of the shares vested.</p><p>It turns out that the ‚Äúgenerous‚Äù 401(k) employer match <em>also</em> has a one-year vesting cliff that you did not notice in the mountain of paperwork they originally gave you, so that balance roughly halves. That match was the only reason why you enrolled in the dumb thing in the first place. You try to log in to initiate a rollover into your personal retirement account, but their website refuses to load on any computer or phone you try. You end up entering your bank account details on a computer at the Apple Store in the mall, seemingly the only place on the planet where HR‚Äôs ‚ÄúmyWorkBenefitsOnlinePlus!Now‚Äù portal actually loads correctly.</p><p>In the immediate wake of your departure, you swore that you would have nothing to do with that company or any of the people that worked there ever again. But with the passing of time, that stance has softened a bit. You see no harm in at least adding them as LinkedIn connections. It‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre going to jump out and drag you back in. Besides, sometimes it‚Äôs fun to scroll through lists of people you remember not liking very much and seeing that they‚Äôre still stuck in places you remember not liking very much. Kinda like keeping tabs on old ex-crushes and taking pleasure in the knowledge that they settled down with miserable people and went on to live unfulfilling lives. You know, totally normal and healthy things to do and think.</p><p>It‚Äôs quite easy to locate all of your former teammates. LinkedIn pretty much already knows the social graph; this feels like more of a formality. Jon, Dave, Davey, Lydia, Karan, Stef, JR, and even Chris. Profile after profile, picture after picture, every face grinning like a possum eating shit. You send a connection request to each one now to save you from having to ever think about it again.</p><p>The one profile you genuinely want to connect with is the one you can‚Äôt seem to find. Val isn‚Äôt connected to any of the members of this group, and you realize that you don‚Äôt even know what her last name is. If there is a single regret that you will come to carry away from these past nine months or so, this might very well be it.</p><hr><p>Today is the first day of the rest of your life. That‚Äôs the saying, right? You‚Äôre supposed to wake up all fresh and renewed, ready to tackle whatever the world throws at you next. Right? This should be your second wind, your new lease on life, the newfound freedom to chart your own course through this world.</p><p>It has hardly ever felt that way in actuality.</p><p>It takes a surprisingly long time for your stomach to return to anything approaching ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù You saw noticeable improvement in your pain levels in the first few weeks, but the layers of hard callused skin don‚Äôt fall away so easily. You haven‚Äôt been flexible enough to stand up and touch your toes since you were a little kid, but at least now you no longer feel like you‚Äôre suffering from appendicitis when you try.</p><p>Your thoughts have slowly started to move on as well. During the initial days after leaving, you would go through phases of anger, sadness, and even moments of embarrassment as you mentally replayed your time at the company. You found that it made a certain amount of sense to handle it the same way a person might handle a bad breakup in a romantic relationship: time, despair-eating, plus a downright eclectic range of music ranging from violently energetic to simply dour. Time, of course, being the most important ingredient. Your need for these other remedies decreases over the course of a few months. The dozen or so bottles of unopened antidepressants and anti-anxiety pills‚Äîall expired now‚Äîend up in the garbage.</p><p>The relative who shared her hopelessly out-of-touch perspective with you over the phone, the two of you had one more afternoon of conversation before she died. She didn‚Äôt ask anything about work, you didn‚Äôt offer anything about it either. Her funeral was a small and dignified affair, attended by precisely zero of her former work acquaintances.</p><p>With the benefits of time and distance, you begin to pick up on patterns that have gone unnoticed for the last ten or fifteen years. The way you felt at this most recent job, it wasn‚Äôt all that different from the way you felt at previous places. That sense of not knowing what value your work provided, the inkling that maybe you were getting paid a lot of money to do nothing of any real consequence, while at the same time feeling a very real stress and anxiety that the whole thing was just a hair‚Äôs breadth away from collapsing and taking you down with it, all while quietly suffering abuse under people who would happily climb over your still-warm corpse to get slightly closer to their own selfish goals. The stomach cramps at this job were novel, yes, but these emotions have been there ever since you started in the industry.</p><p>Was there a single thing you worked on in all that time that objectively made the world better? Is there anything you look back on with pride, something you can point to and say ‚ÄúI did that!‚Äù with a real sense of achievement? Is there anything out there that you know <em>for sure</em> the company even bothered to keep using after you moved on? As far as you can tell, every project you worked on got cancelled or shut down or rewritten or who-knows-what-all within a few years. You don‚Äôt even know for sure if you moved the needle on any of them.</p><p>And let‚Äôs not even get started on <em>you.</em> You, who breezily engaged with any recruiter who blew smoke up your ass. You, applying and interviewing for jobs you didn‚Äôt want, then saying yes to their offers just because the compensation was higher and it felt like maybe the grass would be greener too. You, who time and time again sat around waiting for the world to tell you what you were supposed to do at every given moment, spelled out in big bright letters. Someday you will have to learn that opportunities never find you like that; historically, <em>only punches do.</em></p><p>At some point you had talked to Doug, and he shared that he was thinking of starting a new company. Your response was that you probably weren‚Äôt ready for that. ‚ÄúToo burned out‚Äù was the reason you gave, if memory serves. So, smart guy, was that an opportunity missed or a punch dodged?</p><p>You keep checking on LinkedIn, which is not something a reasonable person does. You find one particular phenomenon at least slightly humorous: Several of your ex-colleagues who had originally accepted your connection requests have‚Äîfor whatever reason‚Äîunfollowed you, leading them to reappear prominently in the ‚Äúpeople you may know‚Äù box. Perhaps they view their link to you as some kind of poison, or your influence leaves them susceptible to whatever social virus led to you eschewing Their Way of Life. Maybe you are just permanently blinded by these cataracts of cynicism, but all you see on the site are punches. People throwing them, people receiving them, folks punching themselves, hucksters selling FIST certifications‚Ä¶ This is your network. These are supposed to be your feet-in-the-doors, your legs up, your flies on the walls, your allies in the trenches. Scrolling through that feed, though, all you see are dozens of novel ways to get your guts pounded.</p><hr><p><em>‚ÄúWhy not be an arborist?‚Äù</em></p><p>You have to give them credit, that‚Äôs a heck of a way to begin the opening paragraph of a job posting. Why not be an arborist; it‚Äôs a question you can honestly say you‚Äôve never been asked before. You consider the suggestion carefully and reach a conclusion: It‚Äôs currently 90 degrees out there and you don‚Äôt like heights. <em>You should absolutely not be an arborist.</em></p><p>You close the tab and place the phone back down on the kitchen counter.</p><p>A small ember of the idea continues to glow in your mind. Sometimes you romanticize the idea of going into the trades. Building houses, fixing air conditioners, pulling cables to bring up a new assembly line. You wonder what turns your life would‚Äôve taken if you hadn‚Äôt tried to aim for this maximally-lazy path of drifting from one slightly-too-cold office to the next. It does seem like people who perform manual labor in physically demanding lines of work end up needing things like lidocaine patches and ‚Äúpain powder‚Äù to a concerning degree, but then again, maybe you should‚Äôve used those last year yourself.</p><p>Is it too late for a career change? Do you even <em>want</em> that? You don‚Äôt even know.</p><p>What you <em>do</em> know is, you can‚Äôt do this forever. You can‚Äôt live out the rest of your days on your dwindling savings. You can‚Äôt keep sitting around doing effectively nothing with this existence you have been given. You can‚Äôt continue to pretend that giving it another day is going to magically reveal an answer to these questions.</p><p>You escaped. You <em>survived.</em> You collected a couple of amusing stories to tell someday. The hard-won wisdom gained in those moments, although never specifically listed as an element of any compensation package, will likely pay dividends as you continue to observe situations and find patterns during your future journeys. The world remains well-stocked with selfish manipulative liars of all shapes and sizes, and you have become acutely aware of just how prevalent they can be in certain environments. Of course cynicism is not something that a person should strive to build their core identity around, but a small amount of it can serve as a powerful inoculant against the damage that might otherwise be inflicted by those personality types. If you could somehow travel back in time to deliver a warning message to your younger self‚Ä¶ you wouldn‚Äôt. This all unfolded the way it was supposed to.</p><p>You step in front of the bathroom mirror and lift the front of your shirt. You squint a little. Your stomach is fine.</p><p>Knowledge, creativity, realism, humor, challenge. You have values. You always knew that you did, but you have only recently rediscovered them.</p><p>Ahead of you, a stretch of road that winds through the rest of your life. One foot in front of the other, you embark.</p><a href="https://www.scottsmitelli.com/articles/" title="Articles">¬´&nbsp;Back to Articles</a></article></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Tesla was hit by a wave of protests across dozens of its stores in North America this weekend. With sales crashing and the board selling, it looks like some insiders are finally waking up.</p>



<p>As we reported last week, a grassroots movement has sprung to <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/02/13/tesla-takeover-protests-pla-at-stores-this-weekend-tesla-takeover/">organize protests against Elon Musk at Tesla stores around North America</a>.</p>



<p>The protests appear to have been quite successful, with primarily peaceful demonstrations in front of Tesla stores.</p>



<p>Here‚Äôs an example in front of Tesla‚Äôs Minneapolis store:</p>

<p>Similar protests happened at dozens of Tesla stores for hours in an attempt to disrupt sales and protest Musk‚Äôs meddling in politics.</p>



<p>Tesla‚Äôs Manhattan showroom saw one of the biggest protests:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While most protests were peaceful and lawful, some vandalism did happen, with images of Tesla stores getting graffitied with anti-fascism phrases.</p>



<p>Groups supporting the protests, like Anonymous, say it is just the beginning and plan to keep putting pressure on Tesla to, in turn, put pressure on Musk.</p>



<p>As we previously reported, <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/02/05/tesla-sales-dropped-60-in-germany/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tesla‚Äôs sales this year are crashing in Europe</a>, where they release monthly data.</p>



<p>In the US, the data comes a bit later, and therefore, it‚Äôs hard to tell how much Tesla sales are being affected by the negative perception of its CEO, but these protests against Tesla are undoubtedly unprecedented.</p>



<p>We have often highlighted how Tesla‚Äôs board of directors, which has authority over the CEO, has been entirely silent on this situation ‚Äì letting Musk do whatever he wants, including spending little time at Tesla while running X, xAI, SpaceX, Neuralink, Boring Company, and DOGE.</p>



<p>While the board remains silent, it sounds like there‚Äôs finally some pushback amongst Tesla insiders.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/02/14/telsa-employees-investors-musk-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Washington Post</a> has obtained a recording from a recent staff meeting at Tesla where some have openly expressed concerns about Musk:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Employees and senior managers at a recent staff meeting at one Tesla division openly expressed concern that Musk is damaging the company‚Äôs business and sustainability mission, according to a recording obtained by The Washington Post.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Tesla employees spoke to the Post about rising beliefs amongst the ranks about Musk&nbsp;‚Äútarnishing the brand.‚Äù</p>



<p>According to a Tesla employee speaking to the Post, senior managers said that they believe ‚Äúthe company would be better off if Musk resigned.‚Äù</p>



<p>While some insiders are starting to speak out within the company, the report highlights how most discontent with Musk among employees happens in private:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Inside Tesla, most discussion of discomfort with the CEO happens quietly over lunch or in private messages, one of the employees who spoke with The Post said, and workers use external communication tools, fearing the company could be monitoring staff for signs of disloyalty.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Tesla regularly implements waves of layoffs, and lately, Musk has been using them to consolidate power and keep only loyalists among his top ranks at Tesla.</p>



<h2 id="h-electrek-s-take">Electrek‚Äôs Take</h2>




	<p>Is this momentum against Elon at Tesla? It‚Äôs hard to tell. I have been fearing that Elon drove away most people who could stand against him at Tesla.</p>



<p>The protests are good, and employees speaking up is good, but at the end of the day, with the board in Elon‚Äôs pocket, it means that nothing short of the stock price crashing to push shareholders to kick the board out is needed.</p>



<p>I could see that happening, as I expect this quarter‚Äôs deliveries and earnings to be quite bad. However, there could also be a broader market downturn, on which Musk could blame Tesla‚Äôs stock‚Äôs poor performance.  </p>



<p>It should be interesting next few months.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			
<p>Last year, I <a href="https://soatok.blog/2024/05/14/its-time-for-furries-to-stop-using-telegram/">urged furries to stop using Telegram</a> because it doesn‚Äôt actually provide them with any of the privacy guarantees they <em>think</em> it gives them. Instead of improving Telegram‚Äôs cryptography to be actually secure, the CEO started spreading misleading bullshit about Signal<a href="#trademark">¬Æ</a>.</p>



<p>Since then, I‚Äôve been flooded with people asking me about <a href="https://soatok.blog/encrypted-messaging-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">various other encrypted messaging apps</a> and accused by Internet reply-guys of having malicious intentions. Some of the more egregiously stupid accusations were that I was somehow being paid to promote Signal.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Not only am I not being paid to promote Signal, I refuse to ever be paid to promote <em>anything</em> ever! <strong>I‚Äôve been <a href="https://soatok.blog/2024/07/02/my-furry-blog-is-not-an-opportunity-to-develop-your-brand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">extremely</a> <a href="https://soatok.blog/2021/05/18/avoiding-the-frigid-hellscape-of-online-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vocal</a> <a href="https://soatok.blog/2024/12/26/roasted-christmas-spam-from-muhu-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">about</a> <a href="https://soatok.blog/2021/12/29/for-your-infurmation/#:~:text=Ad%20revenue%3A%20Still%20%240" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this</a></strong>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>To be clear, being accused of being a paid shill for recommending Signal isn‚Äôt exactly unique to Signal, it also happens with other technologies.</p>



<p>For example: Have you ever wondered by influencers (streamers, vloggers, etc.) always promote ‚Äú<a href="https://gist.github.com/joepie91/5a9909939e6ce7d09e29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VPN services</a>‚Äù instead of Tor (which is free)?</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Why VPNs are a WASTE of Your Money (usually‚Ä¶)" width="768" height="432" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9_b8Z2kAFyY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>It‚Äôs not just ‚Äútoday‚Äôs sponsor‚Äù, either.</p>



<p>Bad security advice, usually <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250207173047/https://infosecforactivists.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">marketed as infosec advice for activists</a>, absolutely <em>loves</em> to recommend specific VPN companies. Interestingly, they frequently make no mention of Tor. When you point this out, the same crowd will <a href="https://ghostarchive.org/archive/25M1U" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">try to weasel in FUD about Tor</a>.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>Soatok</strong>: That they recommend a VPN and not Tor in their first table immediately makes me suspicious.</p>
<cite><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250211092400/https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42941848" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Archive.org mirror</a></cite></blockquote>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>First Reply:</strong> Why? I‚Äôve personally seen more news articles about Tor users getting de-anonymized than I have VPN users. [‚Ä¶]</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The rhetorical sleight-of-hand here isn‚Äôt particularly clever.</p>



<ul>
<li>Tor uses onion-routing to provide anonymity to Internet traffic.</li>



<li>VPNs just provide an encrypted tunnel to another ISP, and therefore do not offer anonymity.</li>



<li>You can‚Äôt <em>deanonymize</em> VPN users because they were never <em>anonymized</em> to begin with!</li>



<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2011/09/26/hidemyass_lulzsec_controversy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VPN providers that lied about ‚Äúno logs‚Äù</a> never faced any meaningful consequences.</li>
</ul>



<p>Tor is at least as private as any VPN. If you‚Äôre worried about exit nodes, only use Tor to access Onion Services or websites that use HTTPS.</p>





<p>As a security engineer that specializes in applied cryptography, I‚Äôm generally not interested in the ‚ÄúTor vs VPN‚Äù debate.</p>



<p>I‚Äôm <em>much</em> more interested in the ‚ÄúWireGuard vs OpenVPN‚Äù debate (on the side of WireGuard), and what lessons about software security the rest of the industry could learn from WireGuard.</p>



<p>In fact: If someone is promoting a VPN service in 2025 and that service doesn‚Äôt use WireGuard as its underlying protocol, they are almost certainly LARPing at security expertise rather than offering valuable advice.</p>



<p>But I digress.</p>



<p>Like Tor, Signal doesn‚Äôt cost you anything to use. Nobody makes money by telling you to use either of those things. </p>



<p>Despite having no financial incentive for doing so, security and privacy experts (including <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/09/tech/secure-chat-apps-signal-tor-browser/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the EFF‚Äôs director of cybersecurity, Eva Galperin</a>) constantly stake their reputation by recommending Tor and Signal.</p>



<p>And therein lies the question: Is Signal‚Äôs cryptography <em>actually</em> good? And how can we be sure of that?</p>



<p>To know this, we first need to discuss cryptography audits.</p>





<h2 id="audits">Audits For Normies</h2>



<p>Audits are a type of engagement between a vendor and a team of security consultants with specific expertise in the technologies involved.</p>



<p>How an audit works is, loosely:</p>



<ul>
<li>The vendor (or a third party, such as <a href="https://ostif.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OSTIF</a>) hires the consultants for a timeboxed assessment of the security of the product or service in question.</li>



<li>The consultants (ideally with the source code in hand) will then try to find any way to subvert the normal operation of the product/service, especially in a way that‚Äôs useful for an attacker.</li>



<li>Any findings that result from the consultants‚Äô work are compiled together into an Audit Report, with specific recommendations for remediating the issues they identified.</li>



<li>The vendor responds by either fixing each issue, or documenting them as known limitations if a fix is impractical.</li>



<li>Optional: The Audit Report is made public.</li>
</ul>



<p>Regardless of the expertise of the consultants, every audit suffers from the same limitations:</p>



<ol>
<li>The engagement has a specific timebox, which means that coverage will be finite.</li>



<li>The engagement is performed over a finite number of snapshots of the source code (typically, one commit hash), so each subsequent commit to the codebase erodes the relevance of the audit.</li>



<li>The consultants are human beings, and therefore imperfect.</li>
</ol>



<p>Furthermore, performing an audit of a product or service without a clear threat model can lead to a lot of disagreement about the relevance or severity of any findings.</p>



<p>This cuts both ways: High-severity issues could actually be nothingburgers to the users of the app, or ‚Äúinformational‚Äù findings could be a dealbreaker to your users. Lacking clarity about the security goals and assumptions can hamstring any efforts to providing security assurance.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, sometimes you will see encrypted messaging apps proudly proclaim, ‚ÄúWe were audited‚Äù when facing criticism, except:</p>



<ul>
<li>Their last audit was 5+ years (and/or over 1000 commits) ago.</li>



<li>They only have the one public audit report.</li>



<li>The company and/or person that did the audit has no other online footprint, including other audits, and only seemed to pop up to opine about this one vendor.</li>



<li>The audit report <a href="https://soatok.blog/2021/09/28/the-bi-symmetric-encryption-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reads more like sales copy</a> than a critical analysis of the product‚Äôs security.</li>



<li>The timebox for the audit is tiny compared to the quantity and complexity of the software in question.</li>
</ul>



<p>It <strong>isn‚Äôt</strong> important that the company providing the audit be one of the more recognizable names (e.g., for cryptography: <a href="https://cure53.de/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cure53</a>, <a href="https://kudelskisecurity.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kudelski Security</a>, <a href="https://leastauthority.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Least Authority</a>, <a href="https://www.nccgroup.com/us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NCC Group</a>, <a href="https://www.trailofbits.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trail of Bits</a>, and myriad blockchain / smart contract security firms that sometimes demonstrate real cryptography chops). </p>



<p>Plenty of smaller security consulting teams do excellent work.</p>



<p>What a more recognizable brand gives you, however, is a reasonable amount of quality control: They‚Äôre generally better resourced to ensure that the appropriate experts are assigned to each project, so you‚Äôre less likely to end up with a useless rubber-stamp Audit Report than you might from a one-person shop in over their head.</p>



<p>It‚Äôs probably better to use the list above to inform your heuristics for assessing the credibility of an Audit Report, rather relying on, ‚ÄúDid the biggest name sign off on it?‚Äù</p>



<h3>Why Are You Telling Us All This?</h3>



<p>Because, like the title says, I‚Äôm going to review the cryptography used by Signal.</p>





<p>This series is morally equivalent to the sort of work you‚Äôd get from an audit, if it were timeboxed over a weekend rather than several weeks.</p>



<h3>Objectives For This Series</h3>



<p>I‚Äôm writing this series in the same spirit as <a href="https://decentsecurity.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SwiftOnSecurity‚Äôs Decent Security</a> guides:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>Everyone can be secure.</strong></p>



<p>It is with those four words this website is founded. Computer, smartphone, and online security does not require a degree or years of experience. All it requires is someone show you the way.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>My spin on the Decent Security mission statement is a bit more ambitious, if narrowly scoped:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>You can understand applied cryptography.</strong></p>



<p>Although the bar for designing and implementing cryptography must be very high to prevent <a href="https://soatok.blog/2025/01/31/hell-is-overconfident-developers-writing-encryption-code/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">overconfident developers from making preventable mistakes that hurt users</a>, being able to critique the security of private messaging apps is a skill anyone is capable of learning.</p>



<p>Verifying the security claims made by an encrypted messaging app does not require a Ph.D in mathematics or an encyclopedic knowledge of software vulnerabilities. All it requires is someone teaching the fundamentals, and then indulging in a bit of self-exploration.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Time will tell if I‚Äôm successful or not.</p>



<p>Additionally, Key Transparency <a href="https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal/commit/949760d2ae6590ffaaa6f8eb1161be2598a24aa9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has recently landed in libsignal</a> (though it has not been consistently implemented in the Signal app yet).</p>



<h3>A Note On Timeboxing</h3>



<p>I did the header image and wrote this blog post earlier, but I did the entirety of this cryptography review over the course of a single weekend. That was the original timebox I set for myself.</p>



<p>I do feel that, if I had allocated more time to it, I might have been able to explain some of the later components in greater detail.</p>



<p>However, as I was writing this, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250217134434/https://www.disruptionist.com/p/elon-musks-x-blocks-links-to-signal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter decided to ban links to signal.me</a> in an attempt to censor Signal users. Thus, I decided to pull the trigger and stay true to my original timebox.</p>

Days after <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Several-Linux-DRM-Orphaned">a DRM driver developer orphaned his drivers due to health reasons</a> in stepping down, the sole maintainer at large of the Linux wireless (WiFi) drivers is stepping down and without any immediate replacement.
</p><p>
Kalle Valo who has been a Qualcomm Atheros engineer for more than the past decade and contributor to the Linux kernel since 2008 during the Linux 2.6 kernel days has decided to step down. Kalle announced this week on the <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/linux-wireless/87wmefguqt.fsf@kernel.org/">Linux wireless mailing list</a>:
</p><blockquote>"I'm stepping down from all my maintainer roles. My first commit feed9bab7b14 ("spi: omap2_mcspi PIO RX fix") to the kernel was back in 2008 for v2.6.24 so I have been here for a long time. Thank you everyone who I have worked with, there are too many to list here.
<p>
Jeff continues to maintain ath10k, ath11k and ath12k drivers so they are unaffected. But for the wireless driver maintainer (drivers/net/wireless/) there is no replacement at the moment. If anyone is interested, please do let Johannes and me know."</p></blockquote>
<p>Kalle was a co-maintainer to the various Qualcomm Atheros WiFi drivers but was the sole maintainer to the wireless networking drivers at large.
</p><p><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2025&amp;image=linux_wireless_maintainer" alt="Linux wireless driver maintainer entry"></p>
<p>Many expressed their appreciation for Kalle's years of service to the Linux networking stack but as of writing no one has stepped up to take over the formal maintainer role. Thankfully there are other Linux WiFi driver developers out there working on the increasing number of Linux wireless drivers, just not any immediate leader yet to take on the maintainer duties.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction to Go 1.24</h2>
<p>The latest Go release, version 1.24, arrives six months after <a href="https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.23">Go 1.23</a>.
Most of its changes are in the implementation of the toolchain, runtime, and libraries.
As always, the release maintains the Go 1 <a href="https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1compat">promise of compatibility</a>.
We expect almost all Go programs to continue to compile and run as before.</p>
<h2 id="language">Changes to the language</h2>
<!-- go.dev/issue/46477 -->
<p>Go 1.24 now fully supports <a href="https://tip.golang.org/issue/46477">generic type aliases</a>: a type alias
may be parameterized like a defined type.
See the <a href="https://tip.golang.org/ref/spec#Alias_declarations">language spec</a> for details.
For now, the feature can be disabled by setting <code>GOEXPERIMENT=noaliastypeparams</code>;
but the <code>aliastypeparams</code> setting will be removed for Go 1.25.</p>

<h3 id="go-command">Go command</h3>
<!-- go.dev/issue/48429 -->
<p>Go modules can now track executable dependencies using <code>tool</code> directives in
go.mod. This removes the need for the previous workaround of adding tools as
blank imports to a file conventionally named ‚Äútools.go‚Äù. The <code>go tool</code>
command can now run these tools in addition to tools shipped with the Go
distribution. For more information see <a href="https://tip.golang.org/doc/modules/managing-dependencies#tools">the
documentation</a>.</p>
<p>The new <code>-tool</code> flag for <code>go get</code> causes a tool directive to be added to the
current module for named packages in addition to adding require directives.</p>
<p>The new <a href="https://tip.golang.org/cmd/go#hdr-Package_lists_and_patterns"><code>tool</code> meta-pattern</a> refers to
all tools in the current module. This can be used to upgrade them all with <code>go get tool</code> or to install them into your GOBIN directory with <code>go install tool</code>.</p>
<!-- go.dev/issue/69290 -->
<p>Executables created by <code>go run</code> and the new behavior of <code>go tool</code> are now
cached in the Go build cache. This makes repeated executions faster at the
expense of making the cache larger. See <a href="https://tip.golang.org/issue/69290">#69290</a>.</p>
<!-- go.dev/issue/62067 -->
<p>The <code>go build</code> and <code>go install</code> commands now accept a <code>-json</code> flag that reports
build output and failures as structured JSON output on standard output.
For details of the reporting format, see <code>go help buildjson</code>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <code>go test -json</code> now reports build output and failures in JSON,
interleaved with test result JSON.
These are distinguished by new <code>Action</code> types, but if they cause problems in
a test integration system, you can revert to the text build output with
<a href="https://tip.golang.org/doc/godebug">GODEBUG setting</a> <code>gotestjsonbuildtext=1</code>.</p>
<!-- go.dev/issue/26232 -->
<p>The new <code>GOAUTH</code> environment variable provides a flexible way to authenticate
private module fetches. See <code>go help goauth</code> for more information.</p>
<!-- go.dev/issue/50603 -->
<p>The <code>go build</code> command now sets the
<a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/runtime/debug#BuildInfo.Main">main module‚Äôs version</a> in the compiled
binary based on the version control system tag and/or commit.
A <code>+dirty</code> suffix will be appended if there are uncommitted changes.
Use the <code>-buildvcs=false</code> flag to omit version control information from the binary.</p>
<!-- go.dev/issue/63939 -->
<p>The new <a href="https://tip.golang.org/doc/godebug">GODEBUG setting</a> <a href="https://tip.golang.org/doc/toolchain#select"><code>toolchaintrace=1</code></a>
can be used to trace the <code>go</code> command‚Äôs toolchain selection process.</p>
<h3 id="cgo">Cgo</h3>
<!-- go.dev/issue/56378, CL 579955 -->
<p>Cgo supports new annotations for C functions to improve run time
performance.
<code>#cgo noescape cFunctionName</code> tells the compiler that memory passed to
the C function <code>cFunctionname</code> does not escape.
<code>#cgo nocallback cFunctionName</code> tells the compiler that the C function
<code>cFunctionName</code> does not call back to any Go functions.
For more information, see <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/cmd/cgo#hdr-Optimizing_calls_of_C_code">the cgo documentation</a>.</p>
<!-- go.dev/issue/67699 -->
<p>Cgo currently refuses to compile calls to a C function which has multiple
incompatible declarations. For instance, if <code>f</code> is declared as both <code>void f(int)</code>
and <code>void f(double)</code>, cgo will report an error instead of possibly generating an
incorrect call sequence for <code>f(0)</code>. New in this release is a better detector for
this error condition when the incompatible declarations appear in different
files. See <a href="https://tip.golang.org/issue/67699">#67699</a>.</p>
<h3 id="objdump">Objdump</h3>
<!-- go.dev/issue/15255, go.dev/issue/36738 -->
<p>The <a href="https://tip.golang.org/cmd/objdump">objdump</a> tool now supports dissassembly on 64-bit
LoongArch (<code>GOARCH=loong64</code>), RISC-V (<code>GOARCH=riscv64</code>), and S390X (<code>GOARCH=s390x</code>).</p>
<h3 id="vet">Vet</h3>
<!-- go.dev/issue/44251 -->
<p>The new <code>tests</code> analyzer reports common mistakes in declarations of
tests, fuzzers, benchmarks, and examples in test packages, such as
malformed names, incorrect signatures, or examples that document
non-existent identifiers. Some of these mistakes may cause tests not
to run.
This analyzer is among the subset of analyzers that are run by <code>go test</code>.</p>
<!-- go.dev/issue/60529 -->
<p>The existing <code>printf</code> analyzer now reports a diagnostic for calls of
the form <code>fmt.Printf(s)</code>, where <code>s</code> is a non-constant format string,
with no other arguments. Such calls are nearly always a mistake
as the value of <code>s</code> may contain the <code>%</code> symbol; use <code>fmt.Print</code> instead.
See <a href="https://tip.golang.org/issue/60529">#60529</a>. This check tends to produce findings in existing
code, and so is only applied when the language version (as specified by the
go.mod <code>go</code> directive or <code>//go:build</code> comments) is at least Go 1.24, to avoid
causing continuous integration failures when updating to the 1.24 Go toolchain.</p>
<!-- go.dev/issue/64127 -->
<p>The existing <code>buildtag</code> analyzer now reports a diagnostic when
there is an invalid Go <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/cmd/go#hdr-Build_constraints">major version build constraint</a>
within a <code>//go:build</code> directive. For example, <code>//go:build go1.23.1</code> refers to
a point release; use <code>//go:build go1.23</code> instead.
See <a href="https://tip.golang.org/issue/64127">#64127</a>.</p>
<!-- go.dev/issue/66387 -->
<p>The existing <code>copylock</code> analyzer now reports a diagnostic when a
variable declared in a 3-clause ‚Äúfor‚Äù loop such as
<code>for i := iter(); done(i); i = next(i) { ... }</code> contains a <code>sync.Locker</code>,
such as a <code>sync.Mutex</code>. <a href="https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.22#language">Go 1.22</a> changed the behavior
of these loops to create a new variable for each iteration, copying the
value from the previous iteration; this copy operation is not safe for locks.
See <a href="https://tip.golang.org/issue/66387">#66387</a>.</p>
<h3 id="gocacheprog">GOCACHEPROG</h3>
<!-- go.dev/issue/64876 -->
<p>The <code>cmd/go</code> internal binary and test caching mechanism can now be implemented
by child processes implementing a JSON protocol between the <code>cmd/go</code> tool
and the child process named by the <code>GOCACHEPROG</code> environment variable.
This was previously behind a GOEXPERIMENT.
For protocol details, see <a href="https://tip.golang.org/cmd/go/internal/cacheprog">the documentation</a>.</p>
<h2 id="runtime">Runtime</h2>
<!-- go.dev/issue/54766 -->
<!-- go.dev/cl/614795 -->
<!-- go.dev/issue/68578 -->
<p>Several performance improvements to the runtime have decreased CPU overheads by
2‚Äì3% on average across a suite of representative benchmarks.
Results may vary by application.
These improvements include a new builtin <code>map</code> implementation based on
<a href="https://abseil.io/about/design/swisstables" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Swiss Tables</a>, more efficient
memory allocation of small objects, and a new runtime-internal mutex
implementation.</p>
<p>The new builtin <code>map</code> implementation and new runtime-internal mutex may be
disabled by setting <code>GOEXPERIMENT=noswissmap</code> and <code>GOEXPERIMENT=nospinbitmutex</code>
at build time respectively.</p>
<h2 id="compiler">Compiler</h2>
<!-- go.dev/issue/60725, go.dev/issue/57926 -->
<p>The compiler already disallowed defining new methods with receiver types that were
cgo-generated, but it was possible to circumvent that restriction via an alias type.
Go 1.24 now always reports an error if a receiver denotes a cgo-generated type,
whether directly or indirectly (through an alias type).</p>
<h2 id="linker">Linker</h2>
<!-- go.dev/issue/68678, go.dev/issue/68652, CL 618598, CL 618601 -->
<p>The linker now generates a GNU build ID (the ELF <code>NT_GNU_BUILD_ID</code> note) on ELF platforms
and a UUID (the Mach-O <code>LC_UUID</code> load command) on macOS by default.
The build ID or UUID is derived from the Go build ID.
It can be disabled by the <code>-B none</code> linker flag, or overridden by the <code>-B 0xNNNN</code> linker
flag with a user-specified hexadecimal value.</p>
<h2 id="bootstrap">Bootstrap</h2>
<!-- go.dev/issue/64751 -->
<p>As mentioned in the <a href="https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.22#bootstrap">Go 1.22 release notes</a>, Go 1.24 now requires
Go 1.22.6 or later for bootstrap.
We expect that Go 1.26 will require a point release of Go 1.24 or later for bootstrap.</p>
<h2 id="library">Standard library</h2>
<h3 id="directory-limited-filesystem-access">Directory-limited filesystem access</h3>
<!-- go.dev/issue/67002 -->
<p>The new <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/os#Root"><code>os.Root</code></a> type provides the ability to perform filesystem
operations within a specific directory.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/os#OpenRoot"><code>os.OpenRoot</code></a> function opens a directory and returns an <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/os#Root"><code>os.Root</code></a>.
Methods on <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/os#Root"><code>os.Root</code></a> operate within the directory and do not permit
paths that refer to locations outside the directory, including
ones that follow symbolic links out of the directory.
The methods on <code>os.Root</code> mirror most of the file system operations available in the
<code>os</code> package, including for example <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/os#Root.Open"><code>os.Root.Open</code></a>,
<a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/os#Root.Create"><code>os.Root.Create</code></a>,
<a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/os#Root.Mkdir"><code>os.Root.Mkdir</code></a>,
and <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/os#Root.Stat"><code>os.Root.Stat</code></a>,</p>
<h3 id="new-benchmark-function">New benchmark function</h3>
<p>Benchmarks may now use the faster and less error-prone <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/testing#B.Loop"><code>testing.B.Loop</code></a> method to perform benchmark iterations like <code>for b.Loop() { ... }</code> in place of the typical loop structures involving <code>b.N</code> like <code>for range b.N</code>. This offers two significant advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>The benchmark function will execute exactly once per -count, so expensive setup and cleanup steps execute only once.</li>
<li>Function call parameters and results are kept alive, preventing the compiler from fully optimizing away the loop body.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="improved-finalizers">Improved finalizers</h3>
<!-- go.dev/issue/67535 -->
<p>The new <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/runtime#AddCleanup"><code>runtime.AddCleanup</code></a> function is a
finalization mechanism that is more flexible, more efficient, and less
error-prone than <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/runtime#SetFinalizer"><code>runtime.SetFinalizer</code></a>.
<code>AddCleanup</code> attaches a cleanup function to an object that will run once
the object is no longer reachable.
However, unlike <code>SetFinalizer</code>,
multiple cleanups may be attached to a single object,
cleanups may be attached to interior pointers,
cleanups do not generally cause leaks when objects form a cycle, and
cleanups do not delay the freeing of an object or objects it points to.
New code should prefer <code>AddCleanup</code> over <code>SetFinalizer</code>.</p>
<h3 id="weak">New weak package</h3>
<p>The new <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/weak/"><code>weak</code></a> package provides weak pointers.</p>
<p>Weak pointers are a low-level primitive provided to enable the
creation of memory-efficient structures, such as weak maps for
associating values, canonicalization maps for anything not
covered by package <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/unique/"><code>unique</code></a>, and various kinds
of caches.
For supporting these use-cases, this release also provides
<a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/runtime/#AddCleanup"><code>runtime.AddCleanup</code></a> and
<a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/maphash/#Comparable"><code>maphash.Comparable</code></a>.</p>
<h3 id="crypto-mlkem">New crypto/mlkem package</h3>
<!-- go.dev/issue/70122 -->
<p>The new <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/mlkem/"><code>crypto/mlkem</code></a> package implements
ML-KEM-768 and ML-KEM-1024.</p>
<p>ML-KEM is a post-quantum key exchange mechanism formerly known as Kyber and
specified in <a href="https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.FIPS.203" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">FIPS 203</a>.</p>
<h3 id="crypto-packages">New crypto/hkdf, crypto/pbkdf2, and crypto/sha3 packages</h3>
<!-- go.dev/issue/61477, go.dev/issue/69488, go.dev/issue/69982, go.dev/issue/65269, CL 629176 -->
<p>The new <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/hkdf/"><code>crypto/hkdf</code></a> package implements
the HMAC-based Extract-and-Expand key derivation function HKDF,
as defined in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5869.html" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">RFC 5869</a>.</p>
<p>The new <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/pbkdf2/"><code>crypto/pbkdf2</code></a> package implements
the password-based key derivation function PBKDF2,
as defined in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8018.html" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">RFC 8018</a>.</p>
<p>The new <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/sha3/"><code>crypto/sha3</code></a> package implements
the SHA-3 hash function and SHAKE and cSHAKE extendable-output functions,
as defined in <a href="http://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.FIPS.202" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">FIPS 202</a>.</p>
<p>All three packages are based on pre-existing <code>golang.org/x/crypto/...</code> packages.</p>
<h3 id="fips140">FIPS 140-3 compliance</h3>
<p>This release includes <a href="https://tip.golang.org/doc/security/fips140">a new set of mechanisms to facilitate FIPS 140-3
compliance</a>.</p>
<p>The Go Cryptographic Module is a set of internal standard library packages that
are transparently used to implement FIPS 140-3 approved algorithms. Applications
require no changes to use the Go Cryptographic Module for approved algorithms.</p>
<p>The new <code>GOFIPS140</code> environment variable can be used to select the Go
Cryptographic Module version to use in a build. The new <code>fips140</code> <a href="https://tip.golang.org/doc/godebug">GODEBUG
setting</a> can be used to enable FIPS 140-3 mode at runtime.</p>
<p>Go 1.24 includes Go Cryptographic Module version v1.0.0, which is currently
under test with a CMVP-accredited laboratory.</p>
<h3 id="testing-synctest">New experimental testing/synctest package</h3>
<p>The new experimental <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/testing/synctest/"><code>testing/synctest</code></a> package
provides support for testing concurrent code.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/testing/synctest/#Run"><code>synctest.Run</code></a> function starts a
group of goroutines in an isolated ‚Äúbubble‚Äù.
Within the bubble, <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/time"><code>time</code></a> package functions operate on a
fake clock.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/testing/synctest#Wait"><code>synctest.Wait</code></a> function waits for
all goroutines in the current bubble to block.</li>
</ul>
<p>See the package documentation for more details.</p>
<p>The <code>synctest</code> package is experimental and must be enabled by
setting <code>GOEXPERIMENT=synctest</code> at build time.
The package API is subject to change in future releases.
See <a href="https://tip.golang.org/issue/67434">issue #67434</a> for more information and
to provide feeback.</p>
<h3 id="minor_library_changes">Minor changes to the library</h3>
<h4 id="archivepkgarchive"><a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/archive/"><code>archive</code></a></h4>
<p>The <code>(*Writer).AddFS</code> implementations in both <code>archive/zip</code> and <code>archive/tar</code>
now write a directory header for an empty directory.</p>
<h4 id="bytespkgbytes"><a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/bytes/"><code>bytes</code></a></h4>
<p>The <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/bytes"><code>bytes</code></a> package adds several functions that work with iterators:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/bytes#Lines"><code>Lines</code></a> returns an iterator over the
newline-terminated lines in a byte slice.</li>
<li><a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/bytes#SplitSeq"><code>SplitSeq</code></a> returns an iterator over
all subslices of a byte slice split around a separator.</li>
<li><a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/bytes#SplitAfterSeq"><code>SplitAfterSeq</code></a> returns an iterator
over subslices of a byte slice split after each instance of a
separator.</li>
<li><a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/bytes#FieldsSeq"><code>FieldsSeq</code></a> returns an iterator over
subslices of a byte slice split around runs of whitespace characters,
as defined by <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/unicode#IsSpace"><code>unicode.IsSpace</code></a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/bytes#FieldsFuncSeq"><code>FieldsFuncSeq</code></a> returns an iterator
over subslices of a byte slice split around runs of Unicode code points
satisfying a predicate.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cryptoaespkgcryptoaes"><a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/aes/"><code>crypto/aes</code></a></h4>
<p>The value returned by <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/aes#NewCipher"><code>NewCipher</code></a> no longer
implements the <code>NewCTR</code>, <code>NewGCM</code>, <code>NewCBCEncrypter</code>, and <code>NewCBCDecrypter</code>
methods. These methods were undocumented and not available on all architectures.
Instead, the <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/cipher#Block"><code>Block</code></a> value should be passed
directly to the relevant <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/cipher/"><code>crypto/cipher</code></a> functions.
For now, <code>crypto/cipher</code> still checks for those methods on <code>Block</code> values,
even if they are not used by the standard library anymore.</p>
<h4 id="cryptocipherpkgcryptocipher"><a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/cipher/"><code>crypto/cipher</code></a></h4>
<p>The new <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/cipher#NewGCMWithRandomNonce"><code>NewGCMWithRandomNonce</code></a>
function returns an <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/cipher#AEAD"><code>AEAD</code></a> that implements AES-GCM by
generating a random nonce during Seal and prepending it to the ciphertext.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/cipher#Stream"><code>Stream</code></a> implementation returned by
<a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/cipher#NewCTR"><code>NewCTR</code></a> when used with
<a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/aes/"><code>crypto/aes</code></a> is now several times faster on amd64 and arm64.</p>
<p><a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/cipher#NewOFB"><code>NewOFB</code></a>,
<a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/cipher#NewCFBEncrypter"><code>NewCFBEncrypter</code></a>, and
<a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/cipher#NewCFBDecrypter"><code>NewCFBDecrypter</code></a> are now deprecated.
OFB and CFB mode are not authenticated, which generally enables active attacks to
manipulate and recover the plaintext. It is recommended that applications use
<a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/cipher#AEAD"><code>AEAD</code></a> modes instead. If an unauthenticated
<a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/cipher#Stream"><code>Stream</code></a> mode is required, use
<a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/cipher#NewCTR"><code>NewCTR</code></a> instead.</p>

<h4 id="cryptorandpkgcryptorand"><a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/rand/"><code>crypto/rand</code></a></h4>
<!-- go.dev/issue/66821 -->
<p>The <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/rand#Read"><code>Read</code></a> function is now guaranteed not to fail.
It will always return <code>nil</code> as the <code>error</code> result.
If <code>Read</code> were to encounter an error while reading from
<a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/rand#Reader"><code>Reader</code></a>, the program will irrecoverably crash.
Note that the platform APIs used by the default <code>Reader</code> are documented to
always succeed, so this change should only affect programs that override the
<code>Reader</code> variable. One exception are Linux kernels before version 3.17, where
the default <code>Reader</code> still opens <code>/dev/urandom</code> and may fail.</p>
<!-- go.dev/issue/69577 -->
<p>On Linux 6.11 and later, <code>Reader</code> now uses the <code>getrandom</code> system call via vDSO.
This is several times faster, especially for small reads.</p>
<!-- CL 608395 -->
<p>On OpenBSD, <code>Reader</code> now uses <code>arc4random_buf(3)</code>.</p>
<!-- go.dev/issue/67057 -->
<p>The new <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/rand#Text"><code>Text</code></a> function can be used to generate
cryptographically secure random text strings.</p>
<h4 id="cryptorsapkgcryptorsa"><a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/rsa/"><code>crypto/rsa</code></a></h4>
<p><a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/rsa#GenerateKey"><code>GenerateKey</code></a> now returns an error if a key of
less than 1024 bits is requested.
All Sign, Verify, Encrypt, and Decrypt methods now return an error if used with
a key smaller than 1024 bits. Such keys are insecure and should not be used.
<a href="https://tip.golang.org/doc/godebug">GODEBUG setting</a> <code>rsa1024min=0</code> restores the old behavior, but we
recommend doing so only if necessary and only in tests, for example by adding a
<code>//go:debug rsa1024min=0</code> line to a test file.
A new <code>GenerateKey</code> <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/rsa#example-GenerateKey-TestKey">example</a>
provides an easy-to-use standard 2048-bit test key.</p>
<p>It is now safe and more efficient to call

<a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/rsa#PrivateKey.Validate"><code>PrivateKey.Validate</code></a>.
<code>Precompute</code> is now faster in the presence of partially filled out
<a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/rsa#PrecomputedValues"><code>PrecomputedValues</code></a>, such as when
unmarshaling a key from JSON.</p>
<p>The package now rejects more invalid keys, even when <code>Validate</code> is not called,
and <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/rsa#GenerateKey"><code>GenerateKey</code></a> may return new errors for
broken random sources.
The <a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/rsa#PrivateKey.Primes"><code>Primes</code></a> and
<a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/rsa#PrivateKey.Precomputed"><code>Precomputed</code></a> fields of
<a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/rsa#PrivateKey"><code>PrivateKey</code></a> are now used and validated even when
some values are missing.

<p>When marshaling, a struct field with the new <code>omitzero</code> option in the struct field

      <p>It's been just over two years and two months since ChatGPT launched, and in that time we've seen Large Language Models (LLMs) blossom from a novel concept into one of the most craven cons of the 21st century ‚Äî a cynical bubble inflated by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman built to sell into an economy run by people that have no concept of labor other than their desperation to exploit or replace it. </p><p>I realize that Large Language Models like GPT-4o ‚Äî the model that powers ChatGPT and a bunch of other apps ‚Äî <em>have use cases</em>, and I'm <em>fucking tired of having to write this sentence.</em> There are people that really like using Large Language Models for coding (<a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/06/13/genai-code-mistakes-copilot-gemini-chatgpt?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>even if the code isn't good</u></a> or<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/draft-theres-good-news-and-bad-news-with-ai-assisted-software-development/?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>makes systems less secure and stable</u></a>) or get something out of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-powered search, or like using one of the various AI companions or journal apps.&nbsp;</p><p>I get it. I get that there are people that use LLM-powered software, and I must be clear that <strong>anecdotal examples of some people using some software that they kind-of like is not evidence that generative AI is a sustainable or real industry at the trillion-dollar scale that many claim it is.</strong></p><p>I am <em>so very bored of having this conversation,</em> so I am now going to write out some counterpoints so that I don't have to say them again.</p><h3 id="ed-there-are-multiple-kinds-of-artificial-intelligence"><strong>Ed, there are multiple kinds of artificial intelligence-</strong></h3><p><strong><em><u>I KNOW.</u></em></strong> Stop saying this to me like an Uno reverse! I'm talking about generative AI!</p><h3 id="well-ed-there-are-300-million-weekly-users-of-chatgpt-that-surely-proves-that-this-is-a-very-real-industry"><strong>Well, Ed, there are</strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/4/24313097/chatgpt-300-million-weekly-users?ref=wheresyoured.at"><strong> <u>300 million weekly users of ChatGPT</u></strong></a><strong>. That surely proves that this is a very real industry!</strong></h3><ol><li>Though I don't have an exact number, I'd estimate that there have been tens of thousands of articles about artificial intelligence written in the last two years that are specifically focused on the generative AI boom, which in turn guarantees that they'll mention ChatGPT.</li><li>The AI bubble means that effectively every single media outlet has been talking about artificial intelligence in the vaguest way, and there's really only been one "product" that they can try that "is AI" ‚Äî and that product is ChatGPT.</li><li>Reporting on artificial intelligence,<a href="https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/news/how-news-coverage-often-uncritical-helps-build-ai-hype?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>according to the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism</u></a>, is led by industry sources, with coverage of artificial intelligence in the UK being summarized by one study as tending to ‚Äúconstruct the expectation of a pseudo-artificial general intelligence: a collective of technologies capable of solving nearly any problem." Specifically, the Reuters Institute's Professor Rasmus Nielsen said that coverage "often takes claims about what the technology can and can‚Äôt do, and might be able to do in the future, at face value in ways that contributes to the hype cycle."<ol><li>In short, most of the coverage you read on artificial intelligence is led by <strong>companies that benefit financially from you thinking artificial intelligence is important</strong> and <strong>by default all of this coverage mentions OpenAI or ChatGPT.</strong></li></ol></li><li>So...yeah, of course ChatGPT has that many users. When you have hundreds of different reporters constantly spitting out stories about how important something may or may not be, and when that thing is <em>available for free on a website</em>, it's going to get a bunch of people using it. This is predominantly the media's doing!</li><li><strong>But 300 million people is a lot!</strong><ol><li>It sure is! But it doesn't really prove anything other than that people are using the single-most-talked about product in the world. By comparison, billions of people use Facebook and Google. I don't care about this number!</li><li>User numbers alone tell you nothing about the sustainability or profitability of a business, or how those people use the product. It doesn‚Äôt delineate between daily users, and those who occasionally (and shallowly) flirt with an app or a website. It doesn‚Äôt say how <em>essential</em> a product is for that person.</li></ol></li></ol><h3 id="also-uhm-ed-its-early-days-for-chatgpt"><strong>Also, uhm, Ed? It's early days for ChatGPT-</strong></h3><ol><li>Shut the fuck up! There isn't a single god damn startup in the history of anything ‚Äî other than perhaps Facebook ‚Äî that has had this level of coverage at such an early stage. Facebook also grew at a time when social media didn't really exist (at least, as a mainstream thing that virtually every demographic used) and thus the ability for something to "go viral" was a relatively new idea. By comparison, ChatGPT had the benefit of there being more media outlets, and Altman himself having spent a decade gladhandling the media<a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-sam-altman-investments-004fc785?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>through his startup investments</u></a> and crafting a real public persona.&nbsp;</li><li>The weekly users number is really weird. Did it really go from<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-says-chatgpts-weekly-users-have-grown-200-million-2024-08-29/?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>200 million</u></a> to<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/04/openais-active-user-count-soars-to-300-million-people-per-week.html?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>300 million</u></a> users in the space of three months?<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>It was at 100 million weekly users in <em>February 2023</em></u></a><em>. </em>You're telling me that OpenAI took, what, over a year to go from 100 million to 200 million, but it took <em>three months</em> (August 29 2024 to December 4 2024) to hit 300 million?<ol><li>I don't have any insider information to counter this, but I will ask ‚Äî where was that growth from? OpenAI launched its o1 "reasoning" model (<a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>the previews, at least</u></a>) on September 12 2024, but these were only available to ChatGPT Plus subscribers,<a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/openai-releases-chatgpt-o1-worlds-smartest-language-model/534597/?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>with the "full" version released on December 5 2024</u></a>. You're telling me this company increased its free user base by <em>50%</em> in less than three months based on nothing other than the <em>availability of a product that wasn't available to free users?</em></li><li>This also doesn't make a ton of sense based on data provided to me by<a href="http://www.similarweb.com/?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>Similarweb</u></a>, a digital market intelligence company. ChatGPT's monthly unique visitors were 212 million in September 2024, 233.1 million in October 2024, and 247.1 million in November 2024. I am not really sure how that translates to 300 million <em>weekly</em> users at all.<ol><li>Similarweb also provided me ‚Äî albeit only for the last few weeks ‚Äî data on ChatGPT.com's weekly traffic. For the period beginning January 21 2025, it only had 126.1 million weekly visitors. For the period beginning February 11 2025, it only had 136.7 million. Is OpenAI being honest about its user numbers? I've reached out for comment, but OpenAI has never, ever replied to me.<ol><li><strong>Sidenote: </strong>Yes, these are <strong><em>visitors</em></strong> versus <em><strong>users</strong></em>. However, one would assume users would be <em>lower</em> than visitors, because a visitor might not actually use the product. What gives?</li></ol></li><li>There could be users on their apps ‚Äî but even then, I'm not really sure how you square this circle. An article from January 29 2025 says that<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/29/chatgpts-mobile-users-are-85-male-report-says/?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>the iOS ChatGPT app has been downloaded 353 million times</u></a> <em>in total</em>. Based on even the most optimistic numbers, are you telling me that ChatGPT has over 100 million <em>mobile only</em> users a week? And no, it isn‚Äôt Apple Intelligence.<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/11/apple-launches-its-chatgpt-integration-with-siri.html?ref=wheresyoured.at#:~:text=Apple%20Intelligence%20is%20the%20company's,of%20Apple%20Intelligence%20in%20October."><u> Cupertino didn‚Äôt launch that integration until December 11 2024.</u></a>&nbsp;</li><li>Here's another question: why doesn't OpenAI reveal <em>monthly </em>active users? Wouldn't that number be higher? After all, a monthly active user is one that uses an app <em>even once</em> over a given month! Anyway, I hypothesize that the reason is probably that<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-coo-says-chatgpt-passed-11-million-paying-subscribers?rc=kz8jh3&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>in September 2024 it came out that OpenAI had 11 million monthly paying subscribers</u></a>, and though ChatGPT likely has quite a few more people that use it once a month, admitting to that number would mean that <strong>we're able to see how absolutely abominable its conversion to paying users is. </strong>300 million monthly active users would mean a conversion rate of less than 4%, which is pretty piss-poor,<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/oai-business/#:~:text=ChatGPT%20Plus%2C%20Teams%2C%20and%20Enterprise%20%E2%80%94%2073%25%20of%20revenue%20(approximately%20%242.7%20billion)."> <u>especially as subscription revenue for ChatGPT Plus (and other monthly subscriptions) makes up the majority of OpenAI's revenue</u></a>.</li></ol></li><li>Hey, wait a second. Are there any other generative AI products that reveal their users? Anthropic doesn't.<a href="https://searchengineland.com/perplexity-plan-sell-ads-438904?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>AI-powered search product Perplexity claims to have 15 million monthly active users</u></a>.

They suggest these products aren't popular!<a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/google-gemini-2025-chatgpt-openai-b6eb595d?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>Google allegedly wants 500 million users of its Gemini chatbot by the end of the year</u></a>, but there isn't any information about how many it‚Äôs at right now.<ol><li>Similarweb data states that google.gemini.com had 47.3 million unique monthly visitors in January 2025, copilot.microsoft.com had 15.6 million, Perplexity.ai had 10.6 million, and claude.ai had 8.2 million. These aren't great numbers!

Fine, fine. Let's get specific. The iPhone fundamentally redefined what a cellphone and a portable computer could be, as did the iPad, creating entirely new consumer and business use cases almost immediately. Cloud computing allowed us to run distinct applications in the cloud, which totally redefined how software was developed and deployed, creating both entirely new use cases for software (as the compute requirements moved from the customer to the provider), and<a href="https://aag-it.com/the-latest-cloud-computing-statistics/?ref=wheresyoured.at#:~:text=Operator%20and%20vendor%20revenues%20for,%24195%20billion%20of%20total%20revenues."> <u>an entirely new cloud computing <em>industry</em> that makes hundreds of billions of dollars a year</u></a>.</li><li>So, what exactly has generative AI actually done?

Putting aside the hype, bluster and ungodly amounts of money, I can find no evidence that any of these apps are making anyone any real money. Microsoft claims to have hit "<a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2025/microsoft-earnings-2/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>$13 billion in annual run rate in revenue from its artificial intelligence products and services</u></a>," which amounts to just over a billion a month, or $3.25 billion a quarter.<ol><li>This is not profit.

The reason I‚Äôm not certain is that in the past The Information has been a touch inconsistent with how it evaluates "costs," in that I‚Äôve seen it claim that OpenAI "burned just $340 million in the first half of 2024,"<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-projections-imply-losses-tripling-to-14-billion-in-2026?rc=kz8jh3&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>a number that they pulled from a piece from last year</u></a> followed by the statement that "[OpenAI's] losses "are steep due to the impact of major expenses, such as stock compensation and computing costs, that don't flow through its cash statement." To be clear, OpenAI burned approximately $5 billion on compute alone. So yeah, OpenAI ‚Äúburned only $340 million last year‚Äù as long as you don‚Äôt consider billions of other costs for some reason. Great stuff! It isn‚Äôt obvious how The Information is evaluating Anthropic‚Äôs burn versus OpenAI‚Äôs, and I‚Äôve reached out to Jon Victor over there to get some clarity. I want to be clear that I very much appreciate, value and recommend The Information‚Äôs journalism, but I do not accept the idea of arbitrarily leaving out costs. This isn‚Äôt real business! Sorry!&nbsp;</li><li>None of these companies are profitable, and despite repeated claims that "the cost of inference is coming down" (the thing that happens when you prompt the model to do something) it doesn't appear to be helping them.<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/deep-impact/"> <u>In the weeks following the release of the super-efficient DeepSeek models</u></a> I kind of expected them to start talking about efficiency.

Great stuff!</li></ol></li></ol><h3 id="what-are-we-doing-here"><strong>What Are We <em>Doing</em> Here?</strong></h3><p>OpenAI and Anthropic are both burning billions of dollars a year, and do not appear to have found a way to stop doing so. The only "proof" that they are going to reverse this trend is The Information saying that "<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/anthropic-projects-soaring-growth-to-34-5-billion-in-2027-revenue?rc=kz8jh3&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>Anthropic's management expects the company to stop burning cash in 2027</u></a>."</p><blockquote><strong>Sidebar: </strong>Hey, what is it with Dario Amodei of Anthropic and the year 2027?<a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/anthropic-chief-says-ai-could-surpass-almost-all-humans-at-almost-everything-shortly-after-2027/?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>He said (made up) that "AI could surpass almost all humans at almost everything" "shortly after 2027" in January</u></a>.

This man is full of shit! Hey, tech media people reading this ‚Äî your readers hate this shit! Stop printing it! Stop it!</blockquote><p>While one could say "the costs will come down," and that appears to be what The Information is claiming, suggesting that "Anthropic said it would reduce its burn rate by "nearly half" in 2025, the actual details are thin on the ground, and there‚Äôs no probing of whether that‚Äôs even feasible without radically changing its models. Huh? How? Anthropic‚Äôs burn increased every single year! So has OpenAI's!</p><p>The Information ‚Äî who I do generally, and genuinely, respect ‚Äî ran an astonishingly optimistic piece about Anthropic <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/anthropic-projects-soaring-growth-to-34-5-billion-in-2027-revenue?rc=kz8jh3&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>estimating that it'd make $34.5 billion in revenue in 2027</u></a> (there's that year again!), the very same year it‚Äôd stop burning cash. Its estimates are based on the premise that "leaders expected API revenue to hit $20 billion in 2027," meaning people plugging Anthropic's models into their own products. This is laughable on many levels, chief of which is that OpenAI, which made around twice as much revenue as Anthropic did in 2024,<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/oai-business/#:~:text=Licensing%20Access%20To%20Models%20And%20Services%20%E2%80%94%2027%25%20of%20revenue%20(approximately%20%241%20billion)."> <u>barely made a billion dollars from API calls in the same year</u></a>.</p><p>It's here where I'm going to choose to scream.</p><p>Anthropic, according to The Information, generated <strong><em>$908 million in revenue in 2024,</em></strong> and has <u>projected</u> that it will make $2.2 billion in revenue in 2025, and its "base case" ‚Äî which The Information says would be "the likeliest outcome (???) ‚Äî is that it will make $12 billion in revenue in 2027.&nbsp;</p><p>This is what happens during bubbles! Assets are over-valued based on a combination of vibes and hysteria!&nbsp;</p><p>Dario Amodei ‚Äî much like Sam Altman ‚Äî is a liar, a crook, a carnival barker and a charlatan, and the things he promises are equal parts ridiculous and offensive. The Information (which needs to do better work actually critiquing these people) justified Amodei and Anthropic's obscene and fantastical revenue targets by<a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/paris-ai-summit?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <em><u>citing Amodei's blog</u></em></a><strong>, </strong>which at no point explains what a "country of geniuses in a datacenter" actually means or what the product might be or what he's going to do to increase revenue by <em>more than thirty billion dollars a year</em> by 2027.</p><p>But wait, The Information says it got a little more specific!</p><blockquote>Anthropic says its technology could transform office roles such as generating or reviewing legal paperwork and automating software engineering. It cited code repository GitLab and legal search firm LexisNexis as examples of customers. Up-and-coming startups such as Anysphere, which develops the Cursor coding assistant for programmers, are also major buyers of Claude software.</blockquote><p>So, just to be abundantly clear, it appears Anthropic's big plan is to "sell people more software to some people, maybe."</p><p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/ai-startup-anthropic-raising-funding-valuing-it-at-60-billion-19d0605a?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>Anthropic is currently raising $2 billion at a $60 billion valuation</u></a> primarily based off of this trumped-up marketing nonsense. Why are we humoring these oafs?</p><h3 id="what-these-oafs-are-actually-doing"><strong>What These Oafs Are Actually Doing</strong></h3><p>When you put aside the hype and anecdotes, generative AI has languished in the same place, even in my kindest estimations, for several months, though it's really been years. The one "big thing" that they've been able to do is to use "reasoning" to make the Large Language Models "think" (they do not have consciousness, they are not "thinking," this just means using more tokens to answer a particular question and having multiple models check the work), which mostly results in them being a bit more accurate when generating an answer, but at the expense of speed and cost.</p><p>This became a little less exciting a month ago when<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/deep-impact/"> <u>DeepSeek released its open source "r1" model which performed similarly to reasoning products from companies like Google and OpenAI</u></a>, and while some argue it "built the model to game benchmarks," that is quite literally what every single model developer does. Nevertheless, the idea of "reasoning" being the "killer app" ‚Äî despite the fact that nobody can really explain why it's such a big deal ‚Äî is now quite dead.</p><p>As a result, the model companies are kind of flailing. In a recent post on Twitter, Sam Altman gave an "<a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1889755723078443244?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>updated roadmap for GPT 4.5 and GPT-5</u></a>" where he described how OpenAI would be "simplifying" its product offerings, saying that GPT-4.5 would be OpenAI's "last non-chain-of-thought model," and that GPT-5 would be "a system that integrates a lot of our technology," including o3, OpenAI's "powerful" and "<a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/openai-o3-cost-per-query?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>very expensive</u></a>" reasoning model, which it...would also no longer release as a standalone model.</p><p>To break this down, Altman is describing his next model ‚Äî GPT 4.5 ‚Äî as launching in some indeterminate timeframe and doing something probably quite similar to the current GPT 4o model. In the case of GPT-5, it would appear that Altman is saying that it won't be a model at all, but some sort of rat king of different mediocre products, including o3, a product that he would no longer be letting you use.</p><p>I guess that's the future of this company, right? OpenAI will release models and uh, well. Uhh.</p><p><em>Uhhhhhhh.</em></p><p>Wait! Wait! OpenAI released a new product! It's called Deep Research, which lets you ask ChatGPT to generate a report by browsing the web. This is almost a cool idea. I sure hope that it doesn't make glaring mistakes and cost a shit-ton of money!</p><p>Anyway, <a href="https://www.platformer.news/chatgpt-deep-research-hands-on/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>let's go to Casey Newton at Platformer for the review</u></a>:</p><blockquote>Generally speaking, the more you already know about something, the more useful I think deep research is. This may be somewhat counterintuitive; perhaps you expected that an AI agent would be well suited to getting you up to speed on an important topic that just landed on your lap at work, for example.&nbsp; In my early tests, the reverse felt true. Deep research excels for drilling deep into subjects you already have some expertise in, letting you probe for specific pieces of information, types of analysis, or ideas that are new to you.<p>It‚Äôs possible that you can make this work better than I did. (I think all of us will get better at prompting these models over time, and presumably the product will improve over time as well.)</p></blockquote><p>Personally, when I ask someone to do research on something, I don't know what the answers will be and rely on the researcher to explain stuff through a process called "research." The idea of going into something knowing about it well enough to <em><strong>make sure the researcher didn't fuck something up</strong></em> is kind of counter to the point of <em>research itself.</em></p><p>Also: "I think all of us will get better at prompting-" Casey, we're paying them! We're paying them for them to do stuff for us!</p><p>Nevertheless, I did go and look up one of Casey's examples,<a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/67a15df0-d2a8-8003-a8df-f01c5ce82083?ref=platformer.news"> <u>specifically one about how the Fediverse could benefit publishers</u></a>.</p><p><strong>Let's do some research!</strong></p><blockquote>Despite Newton's fawning praise, the citations in this "deep research" are flimsy at best.<a href="https://www.twipemobile.com/what-is-the-fediverse-a-guide-for-publishers-and-the-uninitiated/?ref=wheresyoured.at#:~:text=Interoperability%3A%20Because%20ActivityPub%20enables%20different,who%20uses%20a%20different%20server"> <u>The first (and second) citation</u></a>s are from an SEO-bait article about the fediverse from a "news solutions" company called "Twipe" and is used to define "broad cross-platform reach." The next one is<a href="https://digiday.com/media/why-publishers-are-preparing-to-federate-their-sites/?ref=wheresyoured.at#:~:text=At%20least%20two%20digital%20media,driving%20readers%20to%20publishers%E2%80%99%20sites"> <u>from reputable digital advertising outlet Digiday</u></a>, but it's used to cite how sites like 404 Media and The Verge are "actively exploring the Fediverse to take more control over their referral traffic and onsite audience engagement," which is plagiarised ad-verbatim from the Digiday article.<p>After that, the next three citations are <em>posts from Hackernews, a web forum started by yCombinator </em>(</p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34916396&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at#:~:text=Mastodon,now%20a%20pretty%20lonely%20place"><u>here's an example</u></a>). How is this "deep research" exactly?<p>In fact, this thing isn't well-researched at all. Across the following paragraphs, Deep Research cites the same Digiday article <em>eight times</em>, before going back to citing the same Twipe article again. It also, hilariously, says that federated posts "can simultaneously publish to [a] website and as a toot on federated platforms like Mastodon and Threads,"</p><a href="https://gizmodo.com/mastodon-toot-retired-twitter-tweet-equivalent-1849786221?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>a term that Mastodon retired two years ago</u></a>.<p>The next two citations are about</p><a href="https://blog.medium.com/medium-embraces-mastodon-19dcb873eb11?ref=wheresyoured.at#:~:text=air%E2%80%A6%20blog,a%20home%20in%20the%20fediverse"> <u>Medium's embrace of Mastodon</u></a>, followed by yet another citation of the Digiday article. Following that, Deep Research cites two different Reddit posts, a company called<a href="https://community.interledger.org/jeremiahlee/interledger-joins-the-fediverse-30fi?ref=wheresyoured.at#:~:text=Some%20people%20might%20worry%20that,over%20predominantly%20exclusive%20paid%20access"> <u>Interleger moving to the Fediverse</u></a>, which the report cites several more times, along with yet another forum post, <em>the very same Twipe post several more times</em>, and<a href="https://docs.bsky.app/docs/advanced-guides/atproto?ref=wheresyoured.at#:~:text=This%20distinction%20is%20intended%20to,choice"> <u>then the support documentation for social network Bluesky several more times</u></a>.<p>I won't go through more of the research paper citation by citation, but you'll be shocked to hear it mostly just cites Twipe and Hackernews and Reddit.</p><p>For now, Deep Research is only available on ChatGPT Pro, OpenAI's</p><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/06/altman_gpt_profits/?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>somehow-unprofitable</u></a> $200-a-month subscription,<a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1886220053219069995?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>though it's apparently coming to ChatGPT Plus in a limited capacity</u></a>.<p>Not impressed? Well what if I told you it was</p><a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1886220051092512979?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>very compute-intensive and expensive</u></a>? Oh, one other detail ‚Äî the entire thing‚Äôs on the very <em>edge </em>of comprehensible. <p>Here‚Äôs a bit under funding models:</p><p><em><strong>"Memberships and Donations:</strong> A common monetization approach in the Fediverse (and across the open web) is voluntary support from the audience."</em></p><p>Nobody talks like this! This isn‚Äôt how human beings sound! I don‚Äôt like reading it! I don‚Äôt know how else to say this ‚Äî there is something deeply unpleasant about how Deep Research reads! It‚Äôs uncanny valley, if the denizens of said valley were a bit dense and lazy. It‚Äôs quintessential LLM copy ‚Äî soulless and almost, but <em>not quite</em>, right.&nbsp;</p><p>Ewww.</p></blockquote><p>So there you have it folks. OpenAI's next big thing is the ability to generate a report that you would likely not be able to use in any meaningful way anywhere, because while it can browse the web and find things and write a report, it sources things based on what it thinks can confirm its arguments rather than making sure the source material is valid or respectable. This system may have worked if the internet wasn't entirely poisoned by companies trying to get the highest ranking in Google, and if Google had any interest in making sure its results were high quality,<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-men-who-killed-google/"> <u>which it does not</u></a>.</p><p>I'm sorry, I know I sound like a hater, and perhaps I am, but this shit doesn't impress me even a little. Wow, you created a superficially-impressive research project that's really long and that cites a bunch of shit it found online that it made little attempt to verify? And said report took a while to generate, can only be produced if you pay OpenAI $200 each month, and it cost a bunch of money in compute to make?</p><p>Deep Research has the same problem as every other generative AI product. These models don't <em>know</em> anything, and thus everything they do ‚Äî even "reading" and "browsing" the web ‚Äî is limited by their training data and probabilistic models that can say "this is an article about a subject" and posit their <em>relevance</em>, but not truly understand their contents. Deep Research repeatedly citing SEO-bait as a primary source proves that these models, even when grinding their gears as hard as humanely possible, are exceedingly mediocre, deeply untrustworthy, and ultimately useless.</p><p>Furthermore, nothing about this product moves OpenAI toward profitability. In fact, I think they're doing the opposite. Deep Research uses OpenAI's o3 model<a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/openai-o3-cost-per-query?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>which can cost as much as $1,000 a query</u></a>, and while I imagine these prompts aren't <em>that </em>expensive, they are still significantly more so than a regular query from ChatGPT.</p><p>The whole point of hiring a researcher is that you can rely on their research, that they're doing work for you that would otherwise take you hours. Deep Research is the AI slop of academia ‚Äî low-quality research-slop built for people that don't really care about quality or substance, and it‚Äôs not immediately obvious who it‚Äôs for.&nbsp;</p><p>Surely, if you‚Äôre engaged enough to spend $200 on an OpenAI subscription and are aware of Deep Research, you probably know what SEO bait is, and can distinguish between low-quality and high-quality content. If you were presented with a document with such low-quality, repetitive citations, you‚Äôd shred it ‚Äî and, if created by an intern, you‚Äôd shred them too. Or, at the very least, give them some stern words of guidance.&nbsp;</p><p>Let me put this in very blunt terms: we are more than two years into the generative AI boom and OpenAI's biggest, sexiest products are Deep Research ‚Äî a product that dares to ask "what if you were able to spend a lot of compute to get a poorly-cited research paper," and <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/deep-impact/#:~:text=OpenAI%20is%20as,these%20tasks%20yourself.%22"><u>Operator, a compute-intensive application that rarely completes a task in minutes that would otherwise have taken you seconds</u></a>.</p><p>As an aside, SoftBank, the perennial money-losers that backed WeWork and WireCard and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/11/softbank-vision-fund-loses-32-billion-in-a-year-on-startups-valuation-cut/?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>lost more than $30 billion in the last few years</u></a>,<a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/softbank-in-talks-to-invest-up-to-25-billion-in-openai-03d653fc?mod=article_inline&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>are trying to invest up to $25 billion in OpenAI</u></a>.</p><h3 id="i-feel-like-im-going-insane"><strong>I Feel Like I'm Going Insane</strong></h3><p>Everywhere you look, the media is telling you that OpenAI and their ilk are the future, that they're building "advanced artificial intelligence" that can take "human-like actions," but when you look at any of this shit for more than two seconds it's abundantly clear that it absolutely isn't and absolutely can't.</p><p>Despite the hype, the marketing, the tens of thousands of media articles, the trillions of dollars in market capitalization, none of this feels real, or at least real enough to sustain this miserable, specious bubble. People like Marc Benioff claiming that "<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/23/business/davos-marc-benioff-salesforce-ai-prediction-intl/index.html?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>today's CEOs are the last to manage all-human workforces</u></a>" are doing so to pump up their stocks rather than build anything approaching a real product. These men are constantly lying as a means of sustaining hype, never actually discussing <strong><em>the products they sell in the year 2025</em></strong>, because then they'd have to say "what if a chatbot, a thing you already have, was more expensive?"</p><p>The tech industry ‚Äî and part of our economy ‚Äî is accelerating at speed into a brick wall, driven by people like Sam Altman, Dario Amodei, Marc Benioff, and Larry Ellison, all men that are incentivized to have you value their companies based on something <em>other</em> than what their businesses actually sell.&nbsp;</p><p>We are in the midst of a group delusion ‚Äî a consequence of an economy ruled by people that do not participate in labor of any kind outside of sending and receiving emails and going to lunches that last several hours ‚Äî where the people with the money do not understand or care about human beings.&nbsp;</p><p>Their narrative is built on a mixture of hysteria, hype, and deeply cynical hope in the hearts of men that dream of automating away jobs that they would never, ever do themselves. Altman uses his digital baba yaga as a means to stoke the hearts of weak-handed and weak-hearted narcissists that would sooner shoot a man dead than lose a dollar, even if it means making their product that much worse. CEOs have the easiest jobs in the world, and no job is easier than Satya Nadella waving to the Microsoft 365 staff and saying ‚Äúmake them put AI in it, pronto‚Äù and telling Microsoft CFO Amy Hood that ‚Äúwe must make sure that Bing has generative AI‚Äù before jetting off to Davos to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUO7H7OtW3E&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>yell that he intends to burn more money than ever on GPUs</u></a>.</p><p>Sam Altman believes you are stupid. He believes you are a moron that will slurp up whatever slop he gives you. Deep Research and Operator are both half-products that barely brush against the fabric of their intended purposes, and yet the media screams and applauds him like he's a gifted child that just successfully tied his shoes.</p><p>I know, I know, I'm a hater, I'm a pessimist, a cynic, but I need you to fucking listen to me: everything I am describing is unfathomably dangerous,<a href="https://slate.com/technology/2025/02/ed-zitron-interview-big-tech-ai-criticism.html?ref=wheresyoured.at#:~:text=With%20ChatGPT%20and,really%20matters%20here%3F"> <u>even if you put aside the environmental and financial costs</u></a>.</p><p>Let me ask you a question: what's more likely?</p><p>That OpenAI, a company that has only ever burned money, that appears completely incapable of making a truly usable, meaningful product, somehow makes its products profitable, and then somehow creates a truly autonomous artificial intelligence?</p><p>Or that OpenAI, a company that has consistently burned billions of dollars, that has never shown any sign of making a profit, that has in two years released a selection of increasingly-questionable and obtuse products, actually runs out of money?</p><p>How does this industry actually continue? Do OpenAI and Anthropic continue to raise tens of billions of dollars every six months until they work this out?<a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/morgan-stanley-hyperscaler-capex-to-reach-300bn-in-2025/?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>Do the hyperscalers keep spending hundreds of billions of dollars in capital expenditures for little measurable return</u></a>?</p><p>And fundamentally, when will everybody start accepting that the things that AI companies are saying have absolutely nothing to do with reality? When will the media stop treating every single expensive, stupid, irksome, quasi-useless new product is magical, and start asking these people to show us the fucking <em>future</em> already?</p><p>Generative AI is a financial, ecological and social time bomb, and I believe that it's fundamentally damaging the relationship between the tech industry and society, while also shining a glaring, blinding light on the disconnection between the powerful and regular people. The fact that Sam Altman can ship such mediocre software and get more coverage and attention than every meaningful scientific breakthrough of the last five years combined is a sign that our society is sick, our media is broken, and that the tech industry thinks we're all fucking morons.</p><p>This entire bubble has been inflated by hype, and by outright lies by people like Sam Altman and Dario Amodei, their lies perpetuated by a tech media that's incapable of writing down what's happening in front of their faces. Altman and Amodei are raising billions and burning our planet based on the idea that their mediocre cloud software products will somehow wake up and automate our entire lives.</p><p>The truth is that generative AI is as mediocre as it is destructive, and those pushing it as "the future" that "will change everything" are showing how much contempt they have for the average person. They believe that they can shovel shit into our mouths and tell us it's prime rib, that these half-assed products will change the world and that as a result they need billions of dollars and to<a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/ai-data-centers-causing-distortions-in-us-power-grid-bloomberg/?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>damage our power grid</u></a>.</p><p>I know this has been a rant-filled newsletter, but I'm so tired of being told to be excited about this warmed-up dogshit. I'm tired of reading stories about Sam Altman<a href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/sam-altman-says-ai-is-progressing-faster-than-moores-law-as-he-predicts-agi-is-coming-into-view-and-its-leaving-me-worried-about-the-future?ref=wheresyoured.at"> <u>perpetually saying that we're a year away from "everything changing</u></a>" that exist only to perpetuate the myth that Silicon Valley gives a shit about solving anyone's problems other than<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/rotcombubble/"> <u>finding new growth markets for the tech industry</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>I refuse to sit here and pretend that any of this matters. OpenAI and Anthropic are not innovators, and are antithetical to the spirit of Silicon Valley. They are management consultants dressed as founders, cynical con artists raising money for products that will never exist while peddling software that destroys our planet and diverts attention and capital away from things that might solve real problems.</p><p>I'm tired of the delusion. I'm tired of being forced to take these men seriously. I'm tired of being told by the media and investors that these men are building the future when the only things they build are mediocre and expensive. There is no joy here, no mystery, no magic, no problems solved, no lives saved, and very few lives changed other than new people added to Forbes' Midas list.</p><p>None of this is powerful, or impressive, other than in how big a con it‚Äôs become. Look at the products and the actual outputs and tell me ‚Äî does any of this actually feel like the future? Isn‚Äôt it kind of weird that the big, scary threats they‚Äôve made about how AI will take our jobs never seem to translate to an actual product? Isn‚Äôt it strange that despite all of their money and power they‚Äôre yet to make anything truly useful?&nbsp;</p><p>My heart darkens, albeit briefly, when I think of how cynical all of this is. Corporations building products that don't really do much that are being sold on the idea that one day they might, peddled by reporters that want to believe their narratives ‚Äî and in some cases actively champion them. The damage will be tens of thousands of people fired, long-term environmental and infrastructural chaos, and a profound depression in Silicon Valley that I believe will dwarf the dot-com bust.</p><p>And when this all falls apart ‚Äî and I believe it will ‚Äî there will be a very public reckoning for the tech industry.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I recently had a saga with a washing machine that reminded me why one of the most feared and hated tasks for software developers starts with the question:</p><p><strong><em>‚ÄúSo how long will it take you to build that?‚Äù</em></strong></p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64753857f50bbd0ca3a5fb14/67b3e93f8979b7255479e718_AD_4nXettmzPU7UXMfVTKRSFXfOYF6S4OPso6G4dMyzlgb7rYRMlZBVBiJ4t_iLo2cXkNCJjbYpWGNnMWb5Ozd00eDVtauoWQ966jRpjkFYtkRwnT1nPHT435fnn-gZo927Mw-kHv9Ok9A.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption><em>The familiar appliance luring me into a false sense of security</em></figcaption></figure><p>I just moved house. This was the first time I've ever moved into a home that's just been built, making me the first occupant.</p><p>One of the inevitable jobs on day one is hauling the washing machine into position and connecting it to water and power. This is the ninth house move of my life so I figured this installation would be like all the others.</p><p>Based on experience, it usually takes me 10 minutes or less to install a washing machine. Surely 10 minutes was a reasonable estimate for this time too.</p><div><p>This time, though, it took me 4 whole hours. Why was my estimate so off?</p><p>Here's how and why it reminded me so much of the dark art of software effort estimation.</p><p><strong>Blocker #1</strong></p></div><p>I look at the laundry compartment that the washer will sit in. The power point is in another compartment but the builder has forgotten to drill a hole in the shelf to pass that through. I can‚Äôt power the washing machine without that.</p><p><strong>Solution #1</strong></p><p><strong>‚Äç</strong>I don't have a tool to make a big enough hole, but with a little research I find out a hole saw is the way to do it. It's an open-ended drum with serrated saw teeth that you mount on a drill to do the cutting. I go to my local hardware store, get some advice on what to get, and buy a 60mm hole saw.</p><p><strong>Blocker #2</strong></p><p><strong>‚Äç</strong>I get home to use the hole saw, and find out that my consumer grade drill can't even fit the hole saw in the chuck - it's too big. I don't have any adapter that can fit it either.</p><p><strong>Solution #2</strong></p><p><strong>‚Äç</strong>I go back to the hardware store. Another much more experienced-looking staff member tells me (with some slightly rude disdain for my ignorance) that consumer grade drills can't fit or drive hole saws - I need a more powerful trade drill that takes bigger bits. Perhaps so.</p><p>I take his word for it and he lends me his much better drill for $10 for the afternoon and I take it back home. You have to respect the hustle at least. At home, I find that this drill kicks like a mule but I can now mount the hole saw OK.</p><p>I get to drilling and after 25 minutes of learning how to keep it straight and the wonders of noise cancelling earphones, I have a neat 60mm hole with a plastic insert. The cable is through and the power is connected! Job done?</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64753857f50bbd0ca3a5fb14/67b3e93fcc990c91fce4dbf1_AD_4nXcQulpnSpcp2KumD9ENeqVn9x0-pTi6XKhKpD28aefS2qXt8hx3MZXrv6plGKFyAqrjbU8yZpaJeSwK3N_gIUx6_eOiopl-U-vu9mXrA-yN61Vku1vT4vl-eNlaGirk_Hj7-cUMfQ.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption><em>Hole made and presumably the end of this blog post</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Blocker #3</strong></p><p>I pass the inlet and outlet hoses through another hole the builder has this time remembered to drill for that purpose. However, where these hoses worked fine at my old place, they're now too short in the new setup.	</p><p><strong>Solution #3</strong></p><p><strong>‚Äç</strong>I go to a big hardware store. I notice that they sell hoses with a concertina design which can expand from 1.2m to 4m. Hey, MY hoses look like just that too - rather than spending $80 on new hoses, maybe I can just expand the ones I have!</p><p><strong>Blocker #4</strong></p><p>I go home to eagerly expand my hoses. While they look remarkably similar - some would say misleadingly so - they do not, in fact, act like concertinas and remain stubbornly short.</p><p><strong>Solution #4</strong></p><p><strong>‚Äç</strong>I go back to the hardware store and spend $80 to buy new hoses. I go home and install them. Job done?</p><p><strong>Blocker #5</strong></p><p><strong>‚Äç</strong>As I connect the inlet hose to the cold water tap, I discover for the first time that it's covered by a steel cap which is fastened very tightly - certainly too tightly to remove by hand. The cap measures 35mm across and I don't have a shifting spanner big enough to handle it.</p><p><strong>Solution #5</strong></p><p>Back to the hardware store to buy a bigger shifting spanner. My fifth trip out. Back at home with my new tool, I can easily take off the tap's cap now and connect the water. Success!</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64753857f50bbd0ca3a5fb14/67b3e93fddd6445181019de1_AD_4nXeztmVe8Qk_iQofAFWLUI355gbK8nHzYbfT1d9i-x8ylPKCnSA2Zr_c0pxtsoenz8eBc2S68-6wWnLVFHoA36vwN0vpD_RBC6rjAWONIGPfCykhClFtg-hiJylVHrQbtYXVFkLzWw.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption><em>The cold water tap‚Äôs now-removed cap which had been sneakily hiding in plain sight</em></figcaption></figure><p>I connect the washing machine's outlet hose with dirty water to a small spigot under the U-bend beneath the sink. This is the first time I've seen this kind of method to remove the waste water.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64753857f50bbd0ca3a5fb14/67b3e93f3b46343d1ec70143_AD_4nXeHPwRv60ygpO6VYNcoaRxaCG3VjoR97Mr3HYT2aRZwZfylUKir6CqGr68IhmOEOi4D40UMLW-dDyO7f5DgzCMzf22XcjlOG6oNKbBWPq12ZB1Dg7fcPQGpDnMyFGWXh2vNWG5ZQg.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption><em>The spigot in question receiving the outlet hose. And yes, I should have a clamp on that.</em></figcaption></figure><p>I run the machine. I dust off my hands and relax, job done.</p><p><strong>Blocker #6</strong></p><p>After 20 minutes, the washing machine bleeps with an E39 error. Apparently this is a drainage obstruction. I‚Äôm resigned rather than surprised at this point.</p><p><strong>Solution #6</strong></p><p><strong>‚Äç</strong>Poking an exploratory screwdriver into the U-bend's spigot, I find it ends not with a hole into the U-bend but with a PVC wall. But of course it does: if you didn't have a hose connected to the spigot, waste water coming down the U-bend could back up and spill out below your sink. It turns out you have to drill out the PVC wall before connecting the hose, something I had no idea that was required before beginning the project.</p><p>I don't have a spade bit with the perfect width to open the hole, so I pick the biggest drill bit I have to hand. I contort myself to get under the sink to drill. It's not great but it gets the job done.</p><p>I connect the drainage pipe again. I run the washing machine. It works. After five trips to hardware shops to pick up supplies and drop off borrowed drills, I am too tired to celebrate much.</p><p>My initial 10 minute time estimate has gone 24 times over my time budget at 4 hours, including my five round trips to hardware stores.&nbsp;</p><h2>What did I learn?</h2><p>My woeful underestimate was informed by multiple sets of experience installing washing machines, but I had never installed a washing machine in a <em>new</em> house which presented a whole host of challenges I had no idea even existed before I began. ‚ÄúUnknown unknowns‚Äù as we might say.</p><p>As I was thinking about it the next day, <strong>it reminded me in a very physical form why a lot of why software development estimation is so hard.</strong> So often we're asked to build something we've built before, so we estimate with confidence that it might take a week.</p><p>What we fail to factor in is that while 90% of the project will be the same, there's going to be <strong>one critical difference</strong> between the last 5 projects and this project that seemed trivial at the time of estimation but will throw off our whole schedule. I could be one or all of:</p><p>1) Our well-used task-running framework we were going to use for a relatively small part of the system is totally unmaintained now and we'd have to fork it to make it fit for purpose again.</p><p>2) Our entire development tooling ecosystem was obsoleted 18 months after the last time we did this, so we're going to be learning the sharp edges of a whole new toolchain from scratch.</p><p>3) We find that our OS version has moved on and no longer supports key requirements for our existing dependencies, requiring rethinking or developing from scratch.</p><p>4) We need our infrastructure stack to use one component we've never used before and it doesn't work anything like we expected.</p><p>5) We otherwise find there are unstated, totally unknown, or seemingly trivial requirements that significantly change the effort that's going to be required.</p><p>A new house blew out my effort assumptions this time.&nbsp;The shifting sands of software development practices are like moving into new houses multiple times each year.</p><div><p><strong>So what do we do about it when we don‚Äôt even know what questions to ask before setting out on any software project, especially one that ostensibly seems routine?</strong></p><p>For my washing machine, they were unknown unknowns - I didn‚Äôt even expect there‚Äôd be a hole to drill, new hoses to buy, a cold water tap cap to remove, and a spigot PVC wall to drill out.</p></div><p>Yes, we can (and must) gather requirements as best we can, but at some point we‚Äôll end up on the ground and battling dozens of blockers we didn‚Äôt expect to hit, even when we thought the territory looked very familiar and a 10 minute job turns into 4 hours.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>I‚Äôm a child of the 1970s and I‚Äôm glad I never knew about the <strong>Sony FX-300</strong> ‚ÄúJackal 300.‚Äù It would have been the ultimate unobtainable machine of my dreams‚Ä¶this, even despite the lack of shortwave.</p>

<p>Somehow, this radio made it past my RADAR. How? I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs because this model was primarily sold in Japan‚Äì?</p>
<p>The FX-300 sports:</p>
<ul>
<li>A mini CRT television screen (to watch <em>Voyagers!, Space 1999, G-Force,</em> and <em>Ultraman</em>)</li>
<li>Precision analog tuning</li>
<li>Top-Mounted cassette player/recorder</li>

<p>What a Holy Grail machine, indeed! I love the tactile mechanical switches, analog dials, speaker grills, selection switches, and even (especially) the metal stand off bar at the top to protect those brilliant cassette controls.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm very curious if any <em>SWLing Post</em> readers have ever owned (or still own) a Sony FX-300. (Kei Niigata, I‚Äôll be terribly disappointed if I learn you‚Äôve never owned one!)</p>
<p>Please comment!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>The comic Chris Fleming has a great bit:</p><p><span>‚Äú[The singer] Saint Vincent said something the other day‚Ä¶ ‚ÄòI am so glad that I moved to New York City and met all the other freaks like me.‚Äô Those aren‚Äôt </span><em>freaks</em><span>, Saint Vincent, okay? Those are attractive people with heavily vetted idiosyncrasies. Every eccentric fashion choice has been run through a think tank of NYU undergrads that would blow your hair back. You want to see a freak? Go to Albany.‚Äù</span></p><div id="youtube2-ugm_QuQ5RbY" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;ugm_QuQ5RbY&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ugm_QuQ5RbY?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><p>I chuckle because, first of all, everyone knows someone like this. Whatever their domain, they‚Äôve styled themselves with great flair as ‚Äúedgy‚Äù, or an ‚Äúoutcast‚Äù; and have actually convinced themselves that they‚Äôre avant-garde. But their actual deal is cookie-cutter counterculture, like it came out of a street punk paint-by-numbers kit. Whatever Albany is for them, they would never be caught there.</p><p><span>There‚Äôs nothing wrong with this; it‚Äôs more endearing than it is off-putting. But it‚Äôs on my mind recently as I try to process everything going on with AI tools, and how quickly they‚Äôre getting adopted for creative work. I can‚Äôt shake the phrase, </span><strong>‚ÄúAttractive people with heavily vetted idiosyncrasies‚Äù as a description for what AI as a medium wants to produce.</strong><span> (And conversely, the punchline: Y</span><em>ou want to see a freak? Go to pump.fun.</em><span>)</span></p><p><span>To be clear up front, I‚Äôm not an AI luddite in any sense. All these new tools let more people make things, and that‚Äôs just straightforwardly great. But there‚Äôs something a little nauseous about how we express idiosyncrasy, surprise, or character in this new medium. Like the singer in the joke, there‚Äôs just a little too much </span><em>surface confidence</em><span> in AI output about its self-determination; while the medium keeps vigilance for possible objections.</span></p><p>For plenty of purposes, that presentation is perfect. For example, I absolutely love how matter-of-fact Perplexity is when I‚Äôm using it as a reading companion. Perplexity Pro has changed how I read books that assume you know a lot of context; particularly novels. (I‚Äôm currently reading The Magic Mountain, which calls on a maze of concepts that battled for supremacy in early 20th century Europe. Having all that context on hand feels like magic.) Similarly, it‚Äôs not that AI is incapable of thinking about ‚Äústyle‚Äù as a characteristic; quite the opposite. It‚Äôs cool that AI ca write code to faithfully render certain syntactical conventions upon request; that‚Äôs a real feature.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F28c8bba2-c0fb-4b58-98b1-d54c5fac0c30_988x274.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F28c8bba2-c0fb-4b58-98b1-d54c5fac0c30_988x274.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F28c8bba2-c0fb-4b58-98b1-d54c5fac0c30_988x274.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F28c8bba2-c0fb-4b58-98b1-d54c5fac0c30_988x274.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F28c8bba2-c0fb-4b58-98b1-d54c5fac0c30_988x274.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F28c8bba2-c0fb-4b58-98b1-d54c5fac0c30_988x274.png" width="988" height="274" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/28c8bba2-c0fb-4b58-98b1-d54c5fac0c30_988x274.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:274,&quot;width&quot;:988,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:55016,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F28c8bba2-c0fb-4b58-98b1-d54c5fac0c30_988x274.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F28c8bba2-c0fb-4b58-98b1-d54c5fac0c30_988x274.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F28c8bba2-c0fb-4b58-98b1-d54c5fac0c30_988x274.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F28c8bba2-c0fb-4b58-98b1-d54c5fac0c30_988x274.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>But there is still a piece that bugs me: the feeling like it‚Äôs perpetually checking in with a hundred different NYU think tanks to make sure it hasn‚Äôt said anything </span><em>actually</em><span> surprising.

And a lot of the way we‚Äôve done it, beyond just training models harder, is by getting it to ‚Äúreason‚Äù, in many parallel interrogations, about its thought process - ‚ÄúHave I gone down wrong paths here? Was there a more appropriate path I should‚Äôve taken?‚Äù And this machine introspection, I suspect, is functionally analogous to the NYU undergrads in the joke. It‚Äôs almost as if there‚Äôs massively parallel ‚Äúsecond-guessing‚Äù infrastructure getting put into place everywhere that makes sure, ‚ÄúWhoops! This looks like </span><em>a little too original</em><span> thought. Let‚Äôs retrace our steps and make sure we‚Äôre good with the think tank.‚Äù And the artist in me is naturally going to be a bit suspicious.</span></p><p>So, if you‚Äôve made it this far in the essay, you‚Äôre probably wondering about the goths and whether they are downtown. Why are we even talking about goths at all?</p><p><span>Goths are a great test case for whether an environment is </span><em>actually </em><span>conducive to own-rooted self expression. While there are </span><a href="https://www.litlookzstudio.com/blogs/news/types-of-goth" rel="">many kinds of goth</a><span> (goth taxonomy is beyond the scope of this post), I‚Äôll generalize just to say that generally, goths have a quiet confidence, which manifests externally as shyness. Real goths actually care about authenticity of a self-determined style, as opposed t</span><em>o</em><span> caring about being </span><em>perceived</em><span> as ‚Äúauthentically rebellious‚Äù, like the Saint Vincent joke. So I think we can intuit that environments where goths naturally gather might have some creativity-nurturing characteristics, and vice versa.</span></p><p><span>In fact, you don‚Äôt usually see goths downtown. You see them in quiet malls, in the suburbs, farther out. There are actually lots of country goths, which has become a delightful bit of Americana in tiny rural towns today. Not really cities, though. Goths emerge more naturally under conditions of </span><em>small</em><span> numbers of people seeing you </span><em>all the time</em><span>, rather than conditions of </span><em>large </em><span>numbers of people seeing you a little bit.</span></p><p><span>I don‚Äôt think this is a coincidence. Subcultures flourish in places where a smaller number of people see you every day, but they see you more consistently - letting our creative forms of self-expression more successfully burrow into interesting local possibilities. The city, in contrast, means periodically interrogating your style choices from the scrutiny of </span><em>many</em><span> different people, which steers you towards ‚Äúconventionally edgy‚Äù.</span></p><p><span>Let me try and illustrate this. On the left is what happens in the city: you‚Äôre getting periodically evaluated by </span><em>many different observer perspectives</em><span>, whereas out where there‚Äôs space, the evaluation function is a smaller group, but repeatedly over time.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffc19f10f-9764-4624-b63b-daad5f59921a_1740x620.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffc19f10f-9764-4624-b63b-daad5f59921a_1740x620.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffc19f10f-9764-4624-b63b-daad5f59921a_1740x620.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffc19f10f-9764-4624-b63b-daad5f59921a_1740x620.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffc19f10f-9764-4624-b63b-daad5f59921a_1740x620.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffc19f10f-9764-4624-b63b-daad5f59921a_1740x620.png" width="1456" height="519" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fc19f10f-9764-4624-b63b-daad5f59921a_1740x620.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:519,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:307777,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffc19f10f-9764-4624-b63b-daad5f59921a_1740x620.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffc19f10f-9764-4624-b63b-daad5f59921a_1740x620.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffc19f10f-9764-4624-b63b-daad5f59921a_1740x620.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffc19f10f-9764-4624-b63b-daad5f59921a_1740x620.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>Most of my lived experience with this kind of thing comes from playing in a band, where I saw a similar thing happen in our music scene.

</ul><p>In 1905, Sigmund Freud coined the term ‚Äúinfantile amnesia‚Äù, referring to ‚Äúthe peculiar amnesia which, in the case of most people, though by no means all, hides the earliest beginnings of their childhood‚Äù. More than a century later, psychologists are still intrigued by why we can‚Äôt remember our earliest experiences.</p><p>‚ÄúMost adults do not have memories before two to three years of age,‚Äù says Prof Qi Wang at Cornell University. Up until about age seven, memories of childhood are typically patchy.</p><p>Until relatively recently, researchers thought that young brains weren‚Äôt developed enough to form lasting memories. But <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0885201487800151" data-link-name="in body link">studies in the 1980s</a> showed that toddlers as young as two can form memories and recall events from months earlier in great detail. Exposure to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11430844/" data-link-name="in body link">early childhood trauma</a> is also well documented to increase the risk of later anxiety and depression. The paradox of infantile amnesia, says Cristina Alberini, a professor of neural science at New York University, is ‚Äúhow is it that those experiences affect our life forever if they are forgotten?‚Äù</p><p>Alberini‚Äôs <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.4348" data-link-name="in body link">research</a> in animals has found that memories formed during the infantile amnesia period are, in fact, stored in the brain until adulthood, even though they aren‚Äôt consciously remembered. In both animal and human adults, forming and storing long-term memories about one‚Äôs life experiences isn‚Äôt possible without a region of the brain known as the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/may/05/henry-molaison-amnesiac-corkin-book-feature" data-link-name="in body link">hippocampus</a><strong>. </strong>Alberini‚Äôs <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-14461-3" data-link-name="in body link">work</a> has shown that the region is also important in early memories and suggests that infantile amnesia occurs because of a critical period where the hippocampus develops due to new experiences. ‚ÄúIt makes a lot of sense with all the literature of trauma,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIf the children are learning difficult situations in early childhood, maybe they don‚Äôt remember the specifics, but their brains are going to be shaped according to that experience.‚Äù</p><h2 id="why-maori-memories-emerge-earlier">Why MƒÅori memories emerge earlier</h2><p>Differing experiences may also explain why the age at which people recall their first memories varies significantly. Wang, an expert in how culture affects autobiographical memory, has shown that the <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-3514.81.2.220" data-link-name="in body link">earliest memories in Americans</a> date from an age of about 3.5 years, almost six months younger than in Chinese people. The American memories tended to be more self-focused and emotionally elaborate, while the Chinese recollections tended to centre on collective activities and general routines, she found.</p><p>‚ÄúIn the Asian context, identity and sense of self is less defined by being unique, but [more] about your roles and your relationship with others,‚Äù Wang says. To that end, memories may be less important for defining identity than for informing behaviour and imparting lessons. ‚ÄúIf you want to use memory to construct a unique sense of identity, you probably remember a lot of idiosyncratic details,‚Äù Wang says.</p><p>Another explanation for the discrepancy seems to be how parents discuss past experiences with their children. In New Zealand MƒÅori, first memories <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09658210050156822" data-link-name="in body link">emerge earlier</a> than in those of a European background, at about 2.5 years old. Prof Elaine Reese at the University of Otago, who studies autobiographical memory in children and adolescents, points to a strong emphasis on oral traditions in MƒÅori culture but also <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24984106/" data-link-name="in body link">elaborative conversations</a> when reminiscing about past events.</p><p>Reese has tracked groups of children from toddlerhood to adolescence, finding that individuals who had richer narrative environments in childhood could recall <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30165796/" data-link-name="in body link">earlier and more detailed first memories</a> as teenagers. This was the case for children whose mothers asked open-ended questions and were more detailed when talking about <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0885201405800024" data-link-name="in body link">shared past experiences</a>, as well as children who grew up in <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09658211.2011.651090" data-link-name="in body link">extended family households</a>.</p><p>‚ÄúWe know that from the time [children] are, say, six-month-old babies, they‚Äôre capable of some kind of mental imagery of something that happened from the previous day or week,‚Äù Reese says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs taking that mental image and describing it in words that I think is so important for helping them to hold on to that memory over a lifetime.‚Äù</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-14">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-14" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>Ironically, for parenting influencers who post about elaborate holidays in the name of <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2024/01/brooding-why-are-parents-fixated-on-core-memories.html" data-link-name="in body link">creating ‚Äúcore memories‚Äù</a>, the early events that children retain can be surprisingly mundane ‚Äì ‚Äúthings that most parents would never reminisce elaboratively about‚Äù, Reese says. ‚ÄúThe classic example from my own research is a child who remembers seeing a worm on the footpath one time.‚Äù</p><p>There is debate between memory experts as to the role of language in infantile amnesia. Human researchers suggest memories may be limited by an inability to give language to early experiences. ‚ÄúBut there must be something more fundamental that also plays a role because we see this same [infantile amnesia] effect in non-linguistic animals like rats,‚Äù says Prof Rick Richardson of the University of New South Wales.</p><h2 id="improbably-early">‚ÄòImprobably early‚Äô</h2><p>The brain lays down memories not as discrete files as on a computer but as networks of neurons across the brain. Recalling a memory activates those networks and strengthens the links between neurons. This is not to say memory is stable: ‚ÄúEvery time you revisit a memory and think about it, you‚Äôre changing it,‚Äù Reese says.</p><p>Repeated suggestions can lead people to create images and form <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2016/mar/29/social-recall-factors-that-can-affect-false-memory" data-link-name="in body link">false memories</a>, Wang says, citing a famous case in Jean Piaget, the influential child development psychologist. Piaget had a clear memory of his nanny fighting off a would-be kidnapper when he was two ‚Äì but years later, she confessed that she had fabricated the story.</p><p>In a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797618778831?journalCode=pssa" data-link-name="in body link">2018 survey</a>, 39% of respondents reported their first memories occurred at age two or younger. The researchers suggested that ‚Äúimprobably early‚Äù memories, such as recollections of being pushed in a pram or walking for the first time, were likely fictional and based on photographs or family stories. But though memory is malleable and young children are more suggestible, ‚Äúconfabulation is not that common‚Äù, Wang says. ‚ÄúUnder normal conditions, even children do not just take for granted whatever you tell them and incorporate those memories.‚Äù</p><p>So if experiences of our early milestones ‚Äì first birthday, first steps, first trip to the beach ‚Äì seem to be cached somewhere in the brain, why can‚Äôt we consciously access them? While psychologists say it can be adaptive to forget, that doesn‚Äôt explain why the memories formed before age seven seem to decay faster than when we‚Äôre adults. Alberini hypothesises that early unrecalled memories may function as schemas upon which adult memories are built. Like the foundations of a home, they remain concealed but crucial.</p></div></div>]]></description>

  <h2>ON DAVID LYNCH'S <em>REVENGE OF THE JEDI</em></h2><p>Prologue</p><p>SOMEHOW MY FATHER CONVINCED MY mother to squander a date night and watch David Lynch‚Äôs <em>Dune</em> when it was in the theaters in 1984. I was seven; my sister, five. When we asked about the movie, my mother or my father or both‚Äîthey may‚Äôve coordinated their anecdote‚Äîtold me they knew they were in trouble when the theater manager handed out to everyone in the audience a one-sheet that attempted to explain the intricacies of the film‚Äôs logic.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now I am the theater manager. What‚Äôs worse, the production I hope to untangle is my own.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;In 1977, George Lucas released <em>Star Wars</em>. In 1980, he released a sequel, <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em>, and, in 1983, another sequel, <em>Return of the Jedi</em>. During <em>Jedi</em>‚Äôs production, and even after its release, <em>Jedi</em> was often referred to as <em>Star Wars</em> <em>III</em>. This is not to be confused with <em>Star Wars Episode Three: Revenge of the Sith</em>, a <em>Star Wars</em> prequel released in 2005. Also, until the end of 1982, <em>Return of the Jedi</em> was titled <em>Revenge of the Jedi</em>. This is not to be confused with <em>Star Wars Episode Three: Revenge of the Sith</em>.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I write about two directors named David. David Lynch, who wrote and directed <em>Blue Velvet</em> and co-created/directed <em>Twin Peaks</em>, and David Cronenberg, who wrote and directed <em>Videodrome</em> and the 1986 remake of <em>The Fly</em>. I don‚Äôt mean for this to be confusing.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;And:</p><p>&nbsp; Two excerpts from the screenplay for David Lynch‚Äôs <em>Revenge of the Jedi</em> appear in this essay. The first begins, ‚ÄúINTERIOR: DEATH STAR‚ÄîMAIN DOCKING BAY‚Äù; the second begins, ‚ÄúINTERIOR: JABBA‚ÄôS PALACE‚ÄîHALLWAY.‚Äù</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Okay. Let‚Äôs begin.</p><p>1.</p><p>George Lucas and producer Howard Kazanjian considered a number of directors for the third <em>Star Wars</em> film. By April 1981, the decision was between two directors; Lucas offered the job to David Lynch. According to Kazanjian, Lynch ‚Äúwas thrilled.‚Äù&nbsp;At that point, and since May 1980, the film was called <em>Revenge of the Jedi</em>.</p><p>INTERIOR: DEATH STAR‚ÄîMAIN DOCKING BAY</p><p>CLOSE UP: the face of Darth Vader, mask of volcanic glass, brilliantly lit landing bay and white-armored legions therein reflected‚Äîa star-field.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;WIPE TO:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;EXTERIOR: ROAD TO JABBA THE HUTT‚ÄôS PALACE‚ÄîTATOOINE</p><p>(As the image of Darth Vader‚Äôs face is erased, our eyes naturally look to the image that replaces Vader‚Äôs face: a desert road‚Äîbut for a moment, the Vader star-field and the road share the screen. Even as Vader‚Äôs face is replaced by sand, there is an afterimage‚Äîan ocular trick‚Äîthat lingers: the sharp angles of Vader‚Äôs face, the dark lenses where would be eyes, the breath‚Äîa machine, a desert wind‚Äîcrackles hate. In this afterimage, all the seams of Vader‚Äôs mask are apparent and the gruesome flesh within seeks to ooze from them.</p><p>We float above the desert road. ‚ÄúRipples of dust undulate tide-like in the light of the moon. The WHISPERING grains billow up like the foam of waves as they hit the rock.‚Äù&nbsp; Sand blows past and toward the horizon.</p><p>A wind, barely audible but felt large, sounds along the road, caught between walls of rock, a road cut millions of years before by torrents of water all gone deep underground.</p><p>CUT TO:</p><p>INTERIOR: ‚ÄúDARK WATER - MENTAL IMAGE</p><p>‚Ä¶</p><p>‚ÄúSuddenly a drop falls into the black, and white-hot widening rings appear on the dark water's surface.</p><p>‚ÄúDarkness again.‚Äù</p><p>CUT TO:</p><p>EXTERIOR: ROAD TO JABBA THE HUTT‚ÄôS PALACE‚ÄîTATOOINE</p><p>Only the desperate and the foolhardy use this road. ‚ÄúWe hear a familiar beeping and a distinctive voice before [we catch sight] of Artoo-Detoo and See-Threepio [as they make] their way along the road toward the ominous palace‚Ä¶.‚Äù</p><p>2.</p><p>Among the best-known on Lucas and Kazanjian‚Äôs list of might-be directors for the new <em>Star Wars</em> film were Richard Donner, John Carpenter, Terry Gilliam, David Cronenberg, Richard Lester, and John Boorman. This list provides us with a set of what-ifs, some not as compelling as others. Donner, for instance, had, by 1981, directed <em>The Omen</em> (‚Äô76), <em>Superman</em> (‚Äô78), <em>Inside Moves</em> (‚Äô80) and half (give or take) of <em>Superman II</em> (‚Äô80). The <em>Superman</em> films make him an obvious choice: He worked within a well-established mythology, with significant FX, and, incidentally, with composer John Williams. Furthermore, Donner‚Äôs films are without a notable style‚Äîa plus if Lucas wanted his trilogy to look of a piece.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As out-of-place as the other directors on Kazajian and Lucas‚Äôs list might seem, when their cinematic careers are considered only to 1981, their inclusion is easier to understand. By ‚Äô81 for instance, Terry Gilliam had directed only one film, the fantasy comedy <em>Jabberwocky</em> (‚Äô77) (<em>Time Bandits</em> was released in November of ‚Äô81, six months after Lucas chose David Lynch for <em>Revenge of the Jedi</em>). Prior to John Carpenter‚Äôs first big budget effort <em>The Fog</em> (‚Äô80), he directed <em>Dark Star</em> (‚Äô75)<a href="https://www.benningtonreview.org/adam-golaski/#footnote-one">[1]</a>, a comic sf film; <em>Assault on Precinct 13</em> (‚Äô76); and <em>Halloween</em> (‚Äò78). He also co-wrote the screenplay for <em>The Eyes of Laura Mars</em> (‚Äô78), directed by Irvin Kershner (whose next film was <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em>). David Cronenberg‚Äôs <em>The Brood</em> (‚Äô79) and <em>Scanners</em> (‚Äô80) saw the director beyond the low-rent look of <em>Shivers</em> (‚Äô75) and <em>Rabid</em> (‚Äô77) and the avant-garde of his student films <em>Stereo</em> (‚Äô69) and <em>Crimes of the Future</em> (‚Äô70); and though his preoccupation with body horror is very present, it wouldn‚Äôt be firmly established until <em>Videodrome</em> in 1982. Before ‚Äô81, a single image represented all of Cronenberg‚Äôs oeuvre: the exploding head of the First Scanner, designed by Chris Walas, a ‚Äúcreature consultant‚Äù on <em>Jedi</em>.</p><div><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Richard Lester and John Boorman were both experienced filmmakers. Since the Beatles‚Äô film <em>A Hard Day‚Äôs Night</em> (‚Äô64), Lester directed fourteen films before ‚Äô80 (and, in 1980, he directed the other half of <em>Superman II</em>); since <em>Catch Us If You Can</em> (‚Äô65), a vehicle for beat group The Dave Clark Five, Boorman directed six films before ‚Äô81, notably <em>Deliverance</em> (‚Äô72). Lester, either an influence on Lucas or a director whose films Lucas ‚Äúkind of liked,‚Äù&nbsp;became a more conservative director after <em>The Bed Sitting Room</em> (‚Äô69). Throughout the seventies, and culminating with his Superman films (parts II and III) in the eighties, Lester moved toward big-budget fantasy. Boorman‚Äôs catalog, on the other hand, gets progressively weirder (<em>Zardoz</em> [‚Äò73], <em>Exorcist II: The Heretic</em> [‚Äò77]).</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Would <em>Jedi</em> be different if directed by any of these what-ifs?<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yes.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How different?</p></div><p>3.</p><p>Lucas chose Lynch to direct <em>Jedi</em> shortly after <em>The Elephant Man</em> (‚Äô80), Lynch‚Äôs second feature film, proved to be a success (It was nominated for four Golden Globe awards and eight Academy Awards and won several international awards, including the BAFTA for Best Picture), but Lucas was already familiar with, and liked, Lynch‚Äôs work. Lucas, overseeing second-unit work at Elstree Studios in London for <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em> (‚Äô80), crossed paths with director Stanley Kubrick, who was filming <em>The Shining</em> (‚Äô80). ‚ÄúLucas had just seen David Lynch‚Äôs <em>Eraserhead,</em> and praised it for its timeless style: ‚ÄòYou couldn‚Äôt tell what decade it was shot in,‚Äô he told Kubrick, admiringly.‚Äù (For what it‚Äôs worth, Kubrick liked <em>Eraserhead</em> too. According to David Hughes‚Äôs <em>The Complete Lynch</em>, Kubrick ‚Äúscreened <em>Eraserhead</em> for the cast and crew of <em>The Shining</em>, in order to put them in the mood for the film he was making.‚Äù Lynch tells a related anecdote in his book <em>Catching the Big Fish</em>:</p><p>‚Ä¶[some guys who were working with George Lucas] said, ‚ÄúYesterday, David, we were out at Elstree Studios, and we met Kubrick. And as we were talking to him he said to us, ‚ÄòHow would you fellas like to come up to my house tonight and see my favorite film?‚Äô‚Äù They said, ‚ÄúThat would be fantastic.‚Äù They went up, and Stanley Kubrick showed them <em>Eraserhead</em>. So, right then, I could have passed away peaceful and happy.</p><p>[By the way (and I realize we‚Äôre in the midst of a for-what-it‚Äôs-worth), while there is no reason to doubt this anecdote, I <em>do</em> doubt that Kubrick said, ‚Äúfellas,‚Äù etc.‚Äîthe whole dialogue was clearly put through a Lynch filter.])</p><p>INTERIOR: JABBA‚ÄôS PALACE‚ÄîHALLWAY</p><p>CLOSE UP: the back of Threepio‚Äôs golden head: the reflected light fills the screen, dims as the giant metal door closes behind them‚Äîjust before we hear the sound of the door‚Äôs teeth meet, the light goes‚Äîfor a long second, we see nothing but the faint, oval-shape of Threepio‚Äôs head, then on either side of Threepio‚Äôs head, appear the grotesque faces of the palace guards: skin the texture of a slug‚Äôs and slick with a sweat of mucus, pink-rimmed snouts, stupid-marble eyes, and yellowed tusks protruding from their lower lip.</p><p>DISSOLVE TO:</p><p>The face of ‚ÄúBib Fortuna, a humanlike alien with long tentacles protruding from his skull.‚Äù</p><p>CLOSE UP: of Fortuna‚Äôs mouth, a round hole full of little, pointed teeth, and Fortuna‚Äôs pale lips‚ÄîFortuna‚Äôs face drifts in and out of focus as he shouts an abrupt greeting in the club tongue. After a brief exchange between Fortuna and Threepio‚Äîpunctuated by beeps and trills from Artoo‚ÄîFortuna agrees to bring the pair face-to-face with his master.</p><p>We watch as the droids, Fortuna, and the two palace guards walk deep into the tunnel, an ‚Äúendless black cavity.‚Äù We can‚Äôt tell exactly when, but they slip out of sight around a bend in the tunnel.</p><p>INTERIOR: JABBA‚ÄôS THRONE ROOM</p><p>‚Äú‚Ä¶filled with‚Ä¶ creatures‚Ä¶. Artoo and Threepio‚Äù hesitate beneath an arch made of a local stone and without any decoration. The cavernous space is dark, and the curved, low ceiling creates dark spaces. (‚Äú‚Ä¶some sets were so murky and cloistered it was difficult to navigate within them‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúMost of the sets are very dark‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs just made life rather difficult, to physically get the light into the sets, which has been built with ceilings in.‚Äù&nbsp;‚Äú‚ÄòThere was a breathing problem,‚Äô Kazanjian confirms. Indeed, temperatures on the set reached 100<strong>¬∞</strong> under the lights with so many personnel jammed into such a small area, while conditions inside the monster suits were unimaginable‚Äù). Threepio faces an empty space where, logically, Jabba would sit. Instead,</p><p>[Lynch] shows us something that isn‚Äôt in [Frank Herbert‚Äôs novel <em>Dune</em>]. With his fascination for physical and psychological transformation and the potential Otherness of flesh, Lynch is compelled to visualize a Third Stage Guild Navigator‚Ä¶. The‚Ä¶ burnished gilt and emerald Grand Hall is penetrated by a glistening black locomotive-sized oblong box.... [‚ÄúThe golden Byzantian of the throne room is invaded by a locomotive-like carriage bearing the gigantic amoeba who rules the universe.‚Äù] The sides of the huge box slide back, revealing a glass tank filled with orange fog. Then‚Ä¶ a creature glides out of the mist and up to the camera. A giant peach-colored head with a massive cranial dome, cauliflower-textured face with a small, vulva-shaped vertical mouth, pale, wide-spaced eyes almost on the sides of the head, spindly arms and hands, and a long, insect-pupa-like body tapering back into the fog.</p><p>Threepio greets the Third Guild Navigator; the Third Guild Navigator doesn‚Äôt exactly reply, but it does speak:</p><p>THIRD GUILD NAVIGATOR</p><p>We have just folded space from Ix‚Ä¶. Many machines on Ix‚Ä¶ new machines. Better than those on Richesse‚Ä¶ you are transparent‚Ä¶ I see many things‚Ä¶ I see plans within plans.</p><p>THREEPIO</p><p>[Impatiently addresses Artoo] The message, Artoo, the message.</p><p>4.</p><p>David Lynch declined the offer to direct <em>Revenge of the Jedi</em>.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There are several explanations for why Lynch turned down Lucas‚Äô offer. Kazanjian implied‚Äîin either an interview conducted by John Philip Peecher in 1983 or an interview conducted by J. W. Rinzler between 2011 and 2012 (the bibliography in Rinzler‚Äôs <em>The Making of Return of the Jedi</em> doesn‚Äôt make this clear)‚Äîthat Lynch turned down the offer because Dino De Laurentiis offered him <em>Dune</em>, an offer Lynch accepted. More recently, Kazanjian said, at a Star Wars Celebration convention in Anaheim, that Lynch wasn‚Äôt hired because, ‚ÄúAh, he didn‚Äôt want Johnny Williams to do the music and he didn‚Äôt want Ben Burtt‚ÄîAcademy Award winner like three times‚Äîto do the sound.‚Äù He added, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the truth and only you guys have heard it.‚Äù The audience applauds, and the moderator adds, ‚ÄúHa, ha, ha, ha. Wow. That‚Äôs incredible.‚ÄùIncredible, yes‚Äîas in hard to believe. Kazanjian‚Äôs original claim, that Lynch weighed the pros and cons of Lucas‚Äôs offer and chose <em>Dune</em> instead, is more credible.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; While promoting<em> INLAND EMPIRE</em>, Lynch was interviewed by Josh Horowitz for <em>MTV News</em> and was asked, ‚ÄúIs it true you almost directed <em>Return of the Jedi</em>? How close did you come?‚Äù Lynch replied, ‚ÄúNot close at all. I had a meeting with George [Lucas]. I like George. It was his thing. I said, ‚ÄòYou should direct this. It‚Äôs your thing! It‚Äôs not my thing.‚Äô‚Äù Lynch added, in an interview with Chris Rodley, ‚ÄúAnd, obviously, Star Wars was totally George‚Äôs thing,‚Äù and <em>then</em>, after considering Thomas Harris‚Äôs <em>The Red Dragon</em> (ultimately directed by Michael Mann as <em>Manhunter</em> [‚Äò86]), he was offered <em>Dune</em>. My favorite retelling of the story, repeated in part in J. W. Rinzler‚Äôs <em>The Making of Return of the Jedi</em>, is in response to the question, ‚ÄúWhy‚Äôd you turn down George Lucas for directing <em>Star Wars: Return of the Jedi</em>?‚Äù What follows is Lynch‚Äôs anecdote (to preserve the character of the anecdote‚Äîoft repeated but unrehearsed‚ÄîI‚Äôve kept ahs and stutters, etc.):</p><p>I was asked ah by George ah to ah come up to see him and talk to him about directing [what] would be the third <em>Star Wars</em>. And I had next door to zero interest, but I always admired George‚Ä¶ you know George is a guy that does what he loves, and I do what I love, the difference is what George loves makes hundreds of billions of dollars. So I thought I should go up and at least visit with him and it was incredible. I had to go to this building in LA first and get a special credit card and I had to get special keys and a letter came and a map and, um, then I went into the airport and I flew up and then they had a rental car all ready for me and these keys and you know everything was set and I was to drive to this place and I came into an office and there was George and he he talked with me for a little bit and then he said ‚ÄúI want to show you something‚Äù and right about at this time I started to get a little bit of a headache just a‚Äîyou know what I‚Äôm talking about‚Äîokay‚Ä¶ so he took me upstairs and he showed me these things called Wookies. And now this headache is gettin‚Äô, you know, gettin‚Äô stronger. And he showed me many animals and different things. Then he took me for a ride in his Ferrari for a lunch and George is ah, kind of short so he was he was his seat was way back and he was almost lying down in the car and we were flying through this little town up in Northern California we went to a restaurant‚Äînot that I don‚Äôt like salad but that‚Äôs all they had was was salad‚Äîthen I got a really, like, almost like a migraine headache and I could hardly wait to get to home and I and even before I got home I kind of crawled into a phone booth and called my agent and said there was no way no way I could do this. ‚ÄúHe said David David David calm down you don‚Äôt have to do this.‚Äù And, um, so George, bless his heart, I told him on the phone the next day that he should direct it it‚Äôs his film he‚Äôd invented everything about it but he doesn‚Äôt really love directing and so someone else did direct that film. But uh, I did I called my lawyer and told him I wasn‚Äôt going to do it and he said you just lost I don‚Äôt know how many millions of dollars but it‚Äôs okay.‚Äù</p><p>There‚Äôs no audience reaction included at the end of this clip, but Lynch‚Äôs anecdote is meant to amuse, and it is amusing‚ÄîI assume the reaction was laughter.</p><p>5.</p><p>That Lynch was offered <em>Jedi</em> is generally met with bemusement. For instance, Dan Fitch wrote, ‚ÄúThe very notion is as surreal as one of David Lynch‚Äôs own films. Could the director of such unorthodox fare as <em>Eraserhead</em>, <em>Blue Velvet</em>, and <em>Lost Highway</em>, really have taken charge on <em>Star Wars: Episode VI: [Return of the Jedi]</em>?‚Äù</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There‚Äôs nothing surreal about a film producer generating a list of available directors, and that list getting narrowed down to one or two. Nor was it surreal to consider Lynch. He was a respected director, he‚Äôd made a film for a Hollywood studio (Brooksfilms) that was a commercial success, and he was available. It‚Äôs only strange (let‚Äôs not use the word ‚Äúsurreal‚Äù) in retrospect. In 1981, Lynch was not yet the ‚ÄúCzar of Bizarre.‚Äù</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fitch goes on to speculate, ‚ÄúAs for what would have been the consequence of a Lynch directed <em>Return of the Jedi</em>, YouTube is awash with <em>Star Wars</em> fans‚Äô interpretations. Those backward-talking Emperors have to be seen to be believed.‚Äù Fitch exaggerates; there are three such interpretations, the best by Samuel C. Spitale. As parodies, these interpretations are amusing, but in no way do they imagine a Lynch-directed <em>Jedi</em>. As Greg Olson suggests, ‚Äú[Lynch] made the sound judgment that he didn‚Äôt want to be a journeyman worker within a minutely detailed imaginative universe of established characters and situations that another artist had dreamed up.‚Äù We might modify Olson‚Äôs claim; Frank Herbert‚Äôs novel <em>Dune</em> is ‚Äúa minutely detailed imaginative universe of established characters and situations that another artist had dreamed up‚Äù‚Äîbut it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúdreamed up‚Äù on film. Lynch would author the look of <em>Dune</em>. He would not have such a free hand with a <em>Star Wars</em> sequel.</p><p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jedi</em> could never be Lynch‚Äôs <em>Jedi</em>‚Äîexcept subtly.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;David Lynch‚Äôs <em>Revenge of the Jedi</em> would have a different texture. Scenes we know well‚ÄîArtoo-Detoo and See-Threepio‚Äôs encounter with Bib Fortuna inside the cavernous entryway to Jabba the Hutt‚Äôs throne room, for instance, would require little to be made ‚ÄúLynchian.‚Äù A close-up on Fortuna‚Äôs hideous mouth. A moment in the dark when we can no longer tell if Threepio is somewhere in front of us, or if he‚Äôs rounded an invisible corner (‚Äú‚Ä¶I always like something dark in the frame...‚Äù). There‚Äôs so much in that scene that fits the Lynch aesthetic‚Äîconcrete, inscrutable language, the importance of sound design.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Texture is a key word in the Lynch lexicon‚ÄîLynch on texture:</p><p>I don‚Äôt necessarily love rotting bodies, but there‚Äôs a texture to a rotting body that is unbelievable. Have you ever seen a little rotted animal? I love looking at those things, just as much as I like to look at a close-up of some tree bark, or a small bug, or a cup of coffee, or a piece of pie. You get in close, and the textures are wonderful.</p><p>Lynch‚Äôs appreciation for texture is apparent across his oeuvre. From the inclusion of resin sculpture or impressed objects in paintings such as ‚ÄúMan Throwing Up‚Äù (‚Äô67), ‚ÄúRock with Seven Eyes‚Äù (‚Äô96), and ‚ÄúI See My Love‚Äù (‚Äò12) to the body parts that equip ‚ÄúFish Kit‚Äù (‚Äô79) and ‚ÄúChicken Kit‚Äù (‚Äô83), to the curtains‚Äî‚Äúthe walls are red, but they‚Äôre not hard walls‚Äù‚Äîin <em>Twin Peaks</em>‚Äô (‚Äô90 ‚Äì ‚Äò91) red room, to the lamp he builds in the short film ‚ÄúLamp‚Äù (‚Äô03). And this is Lynch on texture in Frank Herbert‚Äôs novel <em>Dune</em>:</p><p>In a lot of ways, this novel is the antithesis of the usual raygun and spaceship science fiction I‚Äôm used to seeing. <em>Dune</em> has believable characters and a lot of depth, a lot of resonance. It‚Äôs not all surface flash. In many ways, Herbert created an <em>internal</em> adventure, one with a lot of emotional and physical textures. And I love textures.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In Lynch‚Äôs <em>Dune</em>, shortly after the Third Guild Navigator floats toward its microphone, Lynch cuts to a close-up of its eye, then to a close up of the fleshy ‚Äúv‚Äù that is its mouth‚Äîtexture. Lynch‚Äôs vision of the Third Guild Navigator‚Äî‚Äúa doughy grasshopper‚Äù‚Äîis reminiscent of the baby in <em>Eraserhead</em>, a moist clay horror of Lynch‚Äôs own making and reminiscent of the more monstrous concept drawings of Jabba the Hutt. Picture old Jabba, licking his lips. James Daniels suggests that the inclusion of the Third Guild Navigator is a direct result of the <em>Star Wars</em> films: ‚ÄúJust as post-<em>SW</em> audiences demanded futuristic weapons, they also demanded weird-looking aliens.‚Äù It‚Äôs more likely Lynch included the Third Guild Navigator because, having read on in the <em>Dune</em> series, and under contract to direct two sequels, he envisioned what a Third Guild Navigator might look like, and wanted to include one in the film.</p><p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dune</em> offers insight into how texture would subtly color David Lynch‚Äôs <em>Revenge of the</em> <em>Jedi</em>.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(I say this is true‚Äîthat <em>Dune</em> offers insight into how texture would subtly color David Lynch‚Äôs <em>Revenge of the Jedi</em>‚Äîin spite of what the makers of <em>Dune</em> themselves said at the time. For instance, Freddie Francis, David Lynch‚Äôs cinematographer, said in 1984: ‚ÄúOne doesn‚Äôt want it to look like <em>Star Wars IV</em>, and it‚Äôs not that sort of film anyway.‚Äù By <em>Star Wars</em> <em>IV</em>, Francis didn‚Äôt mean <em>A New Hope</em>; he meant he didn‚Äôt want Dune to look like a sequel to <em>Jedi</em>.)</p><p>6.</p><p>At a multiplex in Boston during the summer of 1983 I peeked into a theater and saw on the screen Luke Skywalker make his way cautiously across a metal walkway in a dark chamber. A scene <em>like</em> the scene toward the end of <em>Jedi</em>, when Luke and Vader fight in the Emperor‚Äôs throne room, but a scene not actually in the film. Perhaps a showing of David Lynch‚Äôs <em>Revenge of the Jedi</em>.</p><p>7.</p><p>George Lucas and producer Howard Kazanjian considered a number of directors for the third <em>Star Wars</em> film. By April 1981, the decision was between two directors: David Lynch and Richard Marquand. Lucas first offered the job to Lynch; when Lynch declined, Marquand was offered the job, and accepted. Richard Marquand directed <em>Return of the Jedi</em>.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Michel Chion speculates as to why Lucas offered <em>Jedi</em> to Lynch at all:</p><p>In 1981, Lucas proposed that Lynch direct the third episode of the first <em>Star Wars</em> trilogy, <em>Return of the Jedi</em> (1983). This was a sign of esteem and confidence, in view of the financial as well as the emotional stakes riding on this third episode which would have to match the global success of the first two. Lucas‚Äôs choice may seem surprising, because in <em>Star Wars</em> (1977) and <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em> (1980), the emphasis had been on the brio with which scenes were linked to each other and on the light heartedness of the overall tone. ‚Ä¶Lucas‚Äôs proposition suggests that along with the obligatory purple passages, he wished to give the third episode a graver tone in line with the mellowing of characters and the trials they had undergone.</p><p>I wonder, though: if Lucas was looking to make a darker entry, Lynch makes sense, but why, then, consider Marquand? Let me propose, alternative to Chion‚Äôs theory, that maybe Lucas entertained, <em>simultaneously</em>, radically different visions for his film. A dark <em>Star Wars</em> and a bright <em>Star Wars</em>. Jabba‚Äôs palace <em>or</em> the forest moon Endor.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Or,</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Perhaps Lucas knew Lynch would never direct a <em>Star Wars</em>. Lucas enjoyed the <em>frisson</em> of offering the film to Lynch, but deliberately set out to scare Lynch away with ‚ÄúWookies‚Äù (obviously, Ewoks).</p><p>Coda</p><p>Richard Marquand directed <em>Return of the Jedi</em>.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His film credits were few‚Äîa horror flick called <em>The Legacy</em> (‚Äô78), a Beatles biopic (instead of actors, impersonators‚Äîcovers the same ground as <em>Backbeat</em> (‚Äô94) but lacks Laura Palmer), and a respectable spy film called <em>Eye of the Needle</em> (‚Äô81)‚ÄîLucas: ‚ÄúRichard Marquand was the director of the film [<em>Return of the Jedi</em>]. He‚Äôd done some great suspense films and was really good at working with actors. <em>Eye of the Needle</em>&nbsp;was the film I‚Äôd seen that he had done that impressed me the most. It was really nicely done, had a lot of energy and suspense.‚Äù</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Directed, in the case of <em>Jedi</em>, means Marquand sat in the director‚Äôs chair. What else it means, is unclear. The Lucasfilm line on Marquand is that all he could direct were scenes with actors, and otherwise deferred to Lucas, who directed as producer, as he explains:</p><p>These movies [the <em>Star Wars</em> films] by this time had gotten to be more like television shows. The hierarchy in the way a television show works creatively is very much different than the way it works on a motion picture. The executive producer pretty much is the overall creative overseer of the project and comes up with the ideas for the scripts and, you know, directors just try to fulfill the obligation of getting it on the screen.</p><p>Marquand‚Äôs role as director in-name-only is further implied in <em>Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy</em>. The narrator states, ‚ÄúAnother challenge on the set was Richard Marquand‚Äôs relative inexperience with special effects‚Äù; then Carrie Fisher reiterates the point; finally, over footage of Marquand taking cues from Lucas in front of the Endor bunker set, we hear a voice-over of Lucas‚Äî‚ÄúI hadn‚Äôt realized that, you know, ultimately it was probably easier for me to do those things than to farm them out because it was even more complex than the last one, I really did have to end up being there every day on the set and working very closely with Richard and shooting second unit‚Ä¶.‚Äù</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Marquand, however, in a 1984 interview with Jules-Pierre Malartre, claims his directorial stamp is on <em>Jedi</em>: ‚ÄúIf you look at the three<em>&nbsp;Star Wars</em>&nbsp;movies, you can see they‚Äôre very different. Their look and approach to action and camera work, and so forth, are very different.‚Äù Credible, except for special effects shots‚Äîwho directs the shot of a model of an Imperial shuttle moving toward a matte painting of the unfinished Death Star? Marquand further complicates the question of who directed <em>Jedi</em> when he describes his style: ‚ÄúI love to gain a tremendous simplicity. I like to make it look as though it‚Äôs tremendously easy, as though there wasn‚Äôt a camera around very much. I don‚Äôt love flashy work. I like to make it look like it just slid in and happened‚Äù‚Äîhis style, Marquand explains, is to have no discernable style at all.</p><p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Return of the Jedi</em> could only ever be George Lucas‚Äôs <em>Return of the Jedi</em>. Even Lucas‚Äôs <em>Jedi</em> could only be the third <em>Star Wars</em> based on the template established by the first <em>Star Wars</em>. The only totally original vision is <em>A New Hope</em>.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After <em>Jedi</em>, Marquand directed <em>Until September</em> (‚Äô84), a romantic drama starring Karen Allen. Then <em>Jagged Edge</em> (‚Äô85). Robert Loggia was nominated for an Academy Award for best supporting actor; it‚Äôs the film Glen Close starred in before <em>Fatal Attraction</em> (‚Äô87). Janet Maslin dismissed <em>Jagged Edge</em> for its ‚Äúcrashing melodrama‚Äù; Paul Attenasio damns it as a ‚Äúdirector‚Äôs exercise.‚Äù (There‚Äôs a child in the film‚ÄîI can‚Äôt remember whose child‚Äînone of the characters are responsible enough to raise children‚Äîbut I amused myself examining his bedroom: a futuristic truck on his shelf [I spent too much time trying to identify it; it resembles the titular vehicle from the television show <em>Ark II</em> (‚Äô76)‚Äîperhaps it‚Äôs a model from <em>Jedi</em>?] There‚Äôs a <em>Ghostbusters</em> (‚Äô84) poster and, on the back of his bedroom door, a poster for <em>Return of the Jedi</em>.)</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Marquand‚Äôs last picture is <em>Hearts of Fire</em> (‚Äô87), the story of a highly likeable tollbooth operator and singer-songwriter named Molly McGuire who attracts the attention of a middle-aged, retired rocker named Billy Parker. She inspires him to leave his chicken farm and go on tour in England and he invites her to join him as his opening act. While in England, she‚Äôs seduced by James Colt‚Äîa soulless pop star whose hit song (a cover of Soft Cell‚Äôs ‚ÄúTainted Love‚Äù) is all over the radio. Molly is played by ‚ÄúFiona‚Äù‚ÄîFiona Flanagan; Billy is played by Bob Dylan.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The film‚Äôs only delight is Fiona, but‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ Bob Dylan is in it. How do you remain largely unknown after you direct a <em>Star Wars</em> film (of the original trilogy!) <em>and</em> Bob Dylan?</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At a press conference in London for <em>Hearts of Fire</em>, Dylan sits behind a long table with Fiona, Marquand, and‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know who else, the camera keeps zooming in on Dylan. Journalists, incredulous that Dylan is acting in a movie they already know is lousy, keep asking Dylan, Why? Why did you do this film? Dylan offers a variety of non-answers, as is his wont: ‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs just the right time, the right place, the right words.‚Äù To the question, ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you write the script yourself?‚Äù Dylan replies, ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt‚Äôve written a script like this, it‚Äôs beyond me.‚Äù All this can be seen in the documentary <em>Getting to Dylan</em> (‚Äô86); watch it for Marquand‚Äîhe‚Äôs quite charming.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marquand died of a stroke weeks before <em>Hearts of Fire</em> was released.</p>

<p>BOSTON ‚Äî The apparent leader of a cultlike group known as the Zizians has been arrested in Maryland along with another member of the group, Maryland State Police said Monday.</p>
<p>Jack Lasota, 34, was arrested Sunday along with Michelle Zajko, 33, of Media, Pennsylvania. They face multiple charges including trespassing, obstructing and hindering and possession of a handgun in the vehicle.</p>
<p>A bail hearing for the the two is scheduled for 11 a.m. Tuesday at Allegany District Court.</p>
<p>The Zizians have been tied to the killing of U.S. Border Patrol Agent <a href="https://apnews.com/article/vermont-border-patrol-shooting-d40ffa36bad16cfce6174daa3cd3fb96" id="link-1">David Maland</a> near the Canadian border in January and five other homicides in Vermont, Pennsylvania and California.</p>
<p>Maland, 44, was killed in <a href="https://apnews.com/article/vermont-border-patrol-shooting-3ced268f987df53069d0096465ea2271" id="link-2">a Jan. 20 shootout following a traffic stop in Coventry, Vermont</a>, a small town about 20 miles (32 kilometers) from the Canadian border.</p>
<p>Officials have offered few details of the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/vermont-border-agent-killed-78d4336b6ee5ea0bb4ae372627e37f67" id="link-3">cross-country investigation</a>, which broke open after the Jan. 20 shooting death of Maland. Associated Press interviews and a review of court records and online postings tell the story of how a group of young, highly intelligent computer scientists, most of them in their 20s and 30s, met online, shared anarchist beliefs, and became increasingly violent.</p>
<p>Their goals aren‚Äôt clear, but online writings span topics from radical veganism and gender identity to artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>At the middle of it all is ‚ÄúZiz,‚Äù who appears to be the leader of the strange group members who called themselves ‚ÄúZizians.‚Äù She has been seen near multiple crime scenes and has connections to various suspects.</p>
<p>LaSota published a dark and sometimes violent blog under the name Ziz and, in one section, described her theory that the two hemispheres of the brain could hold separate values and genders and ‚Äúoften desire to kill each other.‚Äù</p>
<p>LaSota, who used she/her pronouns, and in her writings says she is a transgender woman, railed against perceived enemies, including so-called rationalist groups, which operate mostly online and seek to understand human cognition through reason and knowledge. Some are concerned with the potential dangers of artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>LaSota, 34, has not responded to multiple Associated Press emails in recent weeks, and her <a href="https://apnews.com/article/vermont-border-patrol-shooting-youngblut-72c1b68aeb3d52cccb05b6b850d83450" id="link-4">attorney Daniel McGarrigle</a> declined to comment when asked whether she is connected to any of the deaths. Before her weekend arrest, she missed court appearances in two states, and bench warrants have been issued for her arrest.</p>
<p>Reached on Monday, McGarrigle would only confirm that he has represented LaSota and wouldn't confirm her arrest or any details of the latest case.</p>

This post is only about the mechanics of getting this working on Linux, and so it doesn‚Äôt explain any of the concepts behind anything.)</p><p>First, we need to generate a private key and a certificate for our certificate authority:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>1</span><span>openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:4096 -out rootca.key
</span></span><span><span>2</span><span>openssl req -x509 -key rootca.key -out rootca.crt -subj <span>"/CN=localhost-ca/O=localhost-ca"</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Note that the certificate of our CA is self-signed, which is necessarily the case with root certificate authorities‚Äîand our CA is a root CA. And it‚Äôs issued by an organization named ‚Äòlocalhost-ca‚Äô (the name, of course, is completely arbitrary).</p><p>Next, we need to generate a private key for the signed certificate we‚Äôll be creating. In this example, we‚Äôll be issuing a certificate for <code>localhost</code>, so we‚Äôll name the private key <code>localhost.key</code>:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>1</span><span>openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:4096 -out localhost.key
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Next, we need to create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_signing_request">certificate signing request</a> file, which we‚Äôll use to obtain a signed certificate from our CA. But before we do that, we need to create a config file which we‚Äôll pass to the <code>openssl</code> commands that follow<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. We‚Äôll name this file <code>csr.conf</code>:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="conf">[req]
distinguished_name = dn
prompt             = no
req_extensions = req_ext

[dn]
CN="localhost"

[req_ext]
subjectAltName = @alt_names

[alt_names]
DNS.0 = localhost
</code></pre><p>The <code>CN=localhost</code> line specifies that we‚Äôre using this config file to obtain a certificate for the domain name <code>localhost</code>. Additional domain names, which the certificate will be valid for, could be specified in the <code>[alt_names]</code> section (with the first domain name named <code>DNS.0</code>, the second one named <code>DNS.1</code>, etc).</p><p>Now we can create the certificate signing request file:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>1</span><span>openssl req -new -key localhost.key -out localhost.csr -config csr.conf
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The final step is to obtain a signed certificate from our very own certificate authority:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>1</span><span>openssl x509 -req -days <span>365</span> -extensions req_ext -extfile csr.conf -CA rootca.crt -CAkey rootca.key -in localhost.csr -out localhost.crt
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The <code>localhost.crt</code> file that this command generates is our certificate for the <code>localhost</code> domain, and <code>localhost.key</code> is its private key. The certificate is now signed with the private key of our CA, so that anyone with our CA‚Äôs public certificate, <code>rootca.crt</code>, can verify that the certificate is signed by our CA.</p><p>All we have to do now is to get our operating-system or the browser to trust our CA. At this point, I would suggest spinning up an HTTPS server at <code>localhost</code>, with the certificate and the private key that we just created, to test whether our certificate is working as it should after we make our CA a trusted CA.</p><h3 id="installing-a-root-ca-certificate-system-wide-on-ubuntu">Installing a root CA certificate system-wide on Ubuntu</h3><p>On Ubuntu, root certificates can be installed with:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>1</span><span>sudo cp rootca.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/
</span></span><span><span>2</span><span>sudo update-ca-certificates
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Firefox and Chromium, however, on Ubuntu, use their own certificate stores; so you‚Äôll have to import the root certificate to these browsers individually. Programs like <code>curl</code> and <code>wget</code> should be able to access <code>https://localhost</code> without a problem now.</p><h3 id="installing-a-root-ca-certificate-system-wide-on-arch-linux">Installing a root CA certificate system-wide on Arch Linux</h3><p>On Arch Linux, root certificates can be installed using:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>1</span><span>sudo trust anchor rootca.crt

Others we have in a comfortable place right here at the airport in an environment where they're getting a lot of care and support from my staff."</p><p>According to Flint, Delta Air Lines Flight 4819, operated by subsidiary Endeavor Air,&nbsp;was involved in a "single aircraft accident" upon landing.</p><p>Aitken told reporters on Monday night that the runway conditions were dry and there were no crosswinds.</p><p>Ornge,&nbsp;Ontario's air ambulance service, said&nbsp;a&nbsp;child was taken to Toronto's Hospital&nbsp;for&nbsp;Sick Children&nbsp;with critical injuries, while a man in his 60s and a woman in her 40s were also taken to Toronto hospitals with critical injuries.</p><p>Three air ambulance helicopters and two critical care land ambulances were dispatched to the scene, Ornge said.</p><p>Peel Regional Police Const.&nbsp;Sarah Patten told Reuters that most of the passengers were&nbsp;unharmed, "but we're still trying to make sure so we're still on scene investigating."</p><p>The airport said earlier in the day that it was expecting a busy day on Monday as airlines tried to catch up after 22 centimetres of snow fell over the weekend, causing&nbsp;a mass of delays and cancellations.

<p dir="auto">NES86 is an IBM PC emulator for the NES.<br>
The goal of this project is to emulate an Intel 8086 processor and supporting PC hardware
well enough to run the
<a href="https://github.com/ghaerr/elks">Embeddable Linux Kernel Subset (ELKS)</a>,
including a shell and utilities.
It should be possible to run other x86 software
as long as it doesn't require more than a simple serial terminal.</p>

<p dir="auto">Download the NES ROM containing NES86 and ELKS from the <a href="https://github.com/decrazyo/nes86/releases">releases</a> page
or build ELKS and NES86 from source.
NES86 uses a mapper configuration that is theoretically valid
but generally not supported by emulators nor flash cartridges.
The following platforms have been tested and Mesen2 is recommended.</p>

<li>Clone the project and its submodules.<br>
<code>git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/decrazyo/nes86.git</code></li>
<li>Install dependencies.<br>

<p dir="auto">The following steps will build an ELKS image that is compatible with NES86.</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Enter the <code>elks</code> directory.<br>
<code>cd nes86/data/elks/elks/</code></li>
<li>Create a <code>cross</code> directory.<br>
<code>mkdir cross</code></li>
<li>Setup your environment.<br>
<code>. ./env.sh</code></li>
<li>Build the cross tool chain. This will take a while.<br>
<code>tools/build.sh</code></li>
<li>Copy or rename the provided configuration file.<br>
<code>cp nes86.config .config</code></li>
<li>Build ELKS.<br>
<code>make all</code></li>
</ol>

<p dir="auto">By default, the NES86 build process will use the ELKS image that was built in the previous step.
If you would like to run some other x86 software then you'll probably need to modify
<code>data/Makefile</code>, <code>src/x86/rom.s</code>, and <code>conf/ld.cfg</code></p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Return to the top level NES86 directory.<br>
<code>cd ../../../</code></li>
<li>Build NES86.<br>
<code>make all</code></li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">The resulting NES ROM can be found at <code>nes86/bin/nes86.nes</code>.</p>
