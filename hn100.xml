<p dir="auto">DualPipe is an innovative bidirectional pipeline parallelism algorithm introduced in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.19437" rel="nofollow">DeepSeek-V3 Technical Report</a>. It achieves full overlap of forward and backward computation-communication phases, also reducing pipeline bubbles. For detailed information on computation-communication overlap, please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/profile-data">profile data</a>.</p>

<p dir="auto">Example DualPipe scheduling for 8 PP ranks and 20 micro-batches in two directions.
The micro-batches in the reverse direction are symmetric to those in the forward direction, so
we omit their batch ID for illustration simplicity. Two cells enclosed by a shared black border
have mutually overlapped computation and communication</p>

					<p>I ordered the DockLite G4 but it was going to take a few weeks to get.
						In the mean time, I needed to find a 17" iMac G4 in good condition but not fully
						working so that I wouldn't be sacrificing a working machine.
						I eventually found one on eBay and I paid nearly as much for shipping as the
						machine itself.
						The iMac uses a lot of thick steel inside the dome which makes it quite heavy.</p>
					<p><em>Pro tip: there are a bunch of 17" G4 iMacs on eBay that are listed as 15".
							I don't know if it's because eBay fills this in by default or if people are
							confused by the screen size since it measures about 15" horizontally but the 17"
							refers to its diagonal size.
							It's usually possible to tell which size it is by the photos since the 15" looks
							much more square, but if you can get the serial number on the bottom,
							<a href="https://everymac.com/ultimate-mac-lookup/">looking it up</a>
							will confirm whether it's 15" or 17".</em></p>
					<p>Once the dead iMac arrived, a power-on test produced a happy chime but showed
						nothing on the screen.
						At this point I wasn't sure if the LCD was busted or if the problem was with the
						iMac's logic board, so I had to get a
						<a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=mini-vga+to+vga">Mini VGA to VGA adapter</a>
						to test its video output.
						This also failed to show any video so I was pretty sure the logic board was
						faulty but I still had no idea whether the LCD worked.</p>
					<p>Eventually the DockLite arrived from Australia and after a few minutes of
						swapping things, I was able to confirm that the LCD worked fine and was
						displaying the Mac Mini's desktop over HDMI.</p>

					<p>Unfortunately after using the iMac for a little while, I noticed a few issues
						that soured my experience with the DockLite.</p>
					<h3 id="color-banding">Color Banding</h3>
					<p>I'm not sure whether the DockLite or the 20-year old LCD screen is to blame for
						this, but there is noticeable color banding on the screen, especially with macOS
						window shadows.</p>
					<figure><a href="https://jcs.org/images/2025-02-26-banding-1500x518.jpg"><img src="https://jcs.org/images/2025-02-26-banding-680x235.jpg" srcset="https://jcs.org/images/2025-02-26-banding-680x235.jpg 1x, https://jcs.org/images/2025-02-26-banding-1360x470@2x.jpg 2x" width="680" height="235"></a>
						<figcaption>Color banding in window shadow</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>I wasn't able to test native Mac OS with the iMac's logic board so I can't be
						sure the problem isn't with the LCD, but I've seen this same problem with some
						other generic
						<a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=lvds+to+hdmi">LVDS/eDP to HDMI</a>
						boards.</p>
					<h3 id="imac-screen-resolution">iMac Screen Resolution</h3>
					<p>My other issue with using the iMac G4 was that its 17" screen has a resolution
						of only 1440x900.
						This isn't terrible but having used 1.5x or 2x resolution screens on my
						<a href="https://jcs.org/openbsd-laptops">laptops</a>
						for many years, the small resolution was not ideal and modern macOS is
						definitely not tuned for 1x resolutions anymore.</p>
					<h3 id="exposed-ports">Exposed Ports</h3>
					<p>It's a very minor gripe, but I would have liked some sort of covers to fill in
						the space between the DockLite's new ports (or lack thereof) and the iMac's
						bottom case cutouts.
						No one's going to see them anyway but for the money, it would have been nice to
						have that included.</p>
					<figure><a href="https://jcs.org/images/2025-02-26-docklite_ports-1500x678.jpg"><img src="https://jcs.org/images/2025-02-26-docklite_ports-680x307.jpg" srcset="https://jcs.org/images/2025-02-26-docklite_ports-680x307.jpg 1x, https://jcs.org/images/2025-02-26-docklite_ports-1360x614@2x.jpg 2x" width="680" height="307"></a>
						<figcaption>DockLite ports</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<h3 id="screen-blanking">Screen Blanking</h3>
					<p>However, my biggest issue with the DockLite is that it doesn't support turning
						off the display via HDMI (DPMS or CEC or whatever this is).
						When the Mac Mini tries to blank the screen after inactivity, the DockLite keeps
						the backlight on showing a black screen.
						Juicy Crumb warns about this in the documentation saying to tap the power button
						on the back of the iMac (which pushes the power button on the DockLite board)
						to turn off the screen since leaving it on all the time will damage it.
						This was going to get pretty annoying since I would like to leave the machine on
						all the time but I wouldn't be using it very often, so I would like the display
						to turn off and back on automatically when I need it.</p>
					<p>On the upside, the DockLite <em>does</em> support adjusting the LCD's backlight level
						via USB through a
						<a href="https://juicycrumb.com/juicy-link/">custom macOS application</a>
						rather than having to press the buttons on the back of the iMac.</p>
					<h2 id="upgrading-the-screen">Upgrading the Screen</h2>
					<p>With these faults in mind, I decided to ditch the DockLite and go with a custom
						screen upgrade.
						With a different LCD and appropriate driver board, I could get a higher
						resolution with better color and gain screen blanking.
						By eliminating the DockLite, I could then remove the iMac's internal power
						supply which otherwise takes up a large portion of the upper part of the dome.
						That would then free up enough room inside the iMac to store the Mac Mini
						without modifying it (as Sean had to in his YouTube video).</p>
					<p>Browsing eBay, I found the
						<a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/295880001215">Sharp LQ170R1JX42</a>,
						a 4K 3840x2400 17" LCD originally used in the Dell XPS 17.
						This would provide a 2x resolution of 1920x1200 in the same outer footprint of
						the iMac's original LCD and fit behind the screen bezel.
						An appropriate
						<a href="https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256807092859241.html">eDP driver board</a>
						would connect the LCD to the Mac Mini over HDMI or USB-C.</p>

						<figcaption>LQ170R1JX42 with eDP driver</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>Once I confirmed the new LCD and driver worked with the Mac Mini, I disassembled
						the iMac to swap its screen.
						The original LCD is quite heavy and is about 1/2" thick due to its CCFL
						backlight.
						The new LCD with its LED backlight is so light and thin, I didn't even bother
						making a frame to attach it to the bezel, I just secured it with tape and then
						mounted the controller to the back of it.</p>

					<h2 id="imac-neck">iMac Neck</h2>
					<p>Once the new LCD was working over USB-C, I ran into the problem of having to get
						the new cable run inside of the iMac's articulating neck.
						The cables connecting to the original LCD are run inside the neck assembly
						during manufacturing and then connectors are added afterward since they are too
						large to fit through the small openings at the top and bottom of the neck.
						Unfortunately this meant I had to cut these original cables to get them out, and
						it also made it difficult to run a USB-C cable through it.</p>
					<p>The smallest diameter of the neck hinge is about 9mm where it meets the dome,
						but most USB-C/Thunderbolt cables I tried had at least a width of about 12mm.
						Even after trimming off the rubber/silicone of some of them, they often had a
						PCB or other stuff inside that was wider than the connector.</p>

							<figcaption>Smallest opening at the neck base</figcaption>
						</figure>
					</center>
					<p>The 9mm opening is on a flange that slides inside the base of the neck and is
						where the dome attaches to the neck with 5 screws.
						It tapers to a smaller opening at the top because there is usually a sleeve that
						goes around it to make rotating smoother, though it's not really needed in my
						experience.
						I figured I could make a new piece like it and make it not taper, allowing the
						inner wall to be thinner and its opening wider, ultimately allowing the USB-C
						cable to pass through it.</p>
					<p>I took some measurements and
						<a href="https://jcs.org/notes/2025/01/27/3lgqyqymzrk2x">modeled</a>
						the flange in Tinkercad, then did a bunch of 3D prints making tiny adjustments
						each time.
						I suppose I'm more of a "measure once, cut 14 times" person.</p>

					<p>Although it's not load bearing (it is sandwiched between the steel openings at
						the top of the dome and bottom of the neck assembly), I wanted the new flange to
						be made out of something stronger than my 3D printer could produce.
						Once my prototyping was done, I sent the design off to
						<a href="https://jlccnc.com/">JLCCNC</a>
						to get it machined out of 6061 aluminum.
						Their engineer said the thin wall of the vertical tube had to be thicker to get
						safely machined, so although the opening ended up not being as wide as I
						wanted, it still allowed a USB-C cable to pass through.</p>
					<p>It took a few weeks to machine since I was doing this during Chinese New Year.
						Although I didn't like the bead-blasted finish which immediately scuffed up, it
						fit perfectly and the dome could securely attach to the neck.</p>

					<p>While every tech reviewer complained about the M4 Mac Mini's power button being
						moved to the bottom, it was actually beneficial to me when putting it inside the
						iMac.  Underneath the iMac is a removable panel that originally gave access to
						the upgradeable RAM and AirPort slots, but I no longer need it.</p>
					<p>By mounting the Mac Mini rotated a bit, the power button is now accessible from
						the bottom of the iMac and can be pressed just by tilting up the left side of
						the iMac a bit.
						Since I would only need to press this button on rare occasions, I figured this
						would be easier than having to disassemble the Mac Mini to solder an external
						power button to it.</p>

					<p>I didn't want to have to open the iMac to reach certain ports, so I bought some
						short extension cables for the IEC C7/C8 power port, ethernet, and one
						Thunderbolt port.
						For now they are just slightly hanging out the back but I'd like to 3D print
						some sort of bracket to hold them all in place just behind the port openings and
						fill in the voids.</p>

					<h2 id="remaining-issues">Remaining Issues</h2>
					<p>Aside from having to make the rear port bracket, I thought it also might be neat
						to make use of the flip-down optical drive door to put some USB ports behind it.</p>
					<p>The eDP LCD controller currently has an annoying "feature" where once the
						display goes to sleep, it shows a blue screen with "No Signal" shown for about
						10 seconds before completely shutting off.
						From what I've read, it's possible to disable this in the firmware but I'm
						still trying to figure out how to modify that.</p>

   <p>The <em>Washington Post</em>'s billionaire owner, Jeff Bezos, announced a sweeping new libertarian vision for the paper's opinion sections on Wednesday, just four months after his decision to kill a presidential endorsement of Kamala Harris triggered hundreds of thousands of subscribers to cancel.</p>   <p><em>Post</em> Opinions Editor David Shipley, whom Bezos recruited from Bloomberg Opinions in 2022, chose to resign rather than stay to oversee the paper's revamped sections.</p>   <p>"We are going to be writing every day in support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets," Bezos <a href="https://x.com/JeffBezos/status/1894757287052362088" target="_blank"><u>wrote in a memo to staffers</u></a> announcing the changes. "We'll cover other topics too of course, but viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others."</p>   
   <p>Newspaper op-ed sections have incorporated opposing views for years. The term "op-ed" is literally an abbreviation for pieces running "opposite the editorial pages" that often conflicted with a publisher's editorial line. But Bezos characterized that practice as outdated.</p>   <p>"There was a time when a newspaper, especially one that was a local monopoly, might have seen it as a service to bring to the reader's doorstep every morning a broad-based opinion section that sought to cover all views," Bezos said. "Today, the internet does that job."</p>   <h3>Shock inside the newsroom</h3>   <p>At an hour-long meeting with opinion writers, Shipley said he did not know what lay ahead, according to an attendee who spoke on condition of anonymity because they did not have permission to speak publicly.</p>   <p>Shipley said he had wanted a "broader, pluralistic place," but that Bezos sought "a focused [opinion] report."</p>   <p>Bezos justified his decision in the memo to staffers. "I am of America and for America, and proud to be so," he wrote. "And a big part of America's success has been freedom in the economic realm and everywhere else."</p>   <p>The decision sparked fresh shock and dismay at the paper. After senior news editors raised concerns at a meeting Wednesday, Executive Editor Matt Murray reassured them that Bezos had given no indication that he wanted to interfere with news coverage, according to two people with direct knowledge. A spokesperson for the <em>Post</em> confirmed his remarks.</p>

   <p>Later in the day, Murray sent a memo to the newsroom to underscore the point: "The independent and unbiased work of The Post's newsroom remains unchanged, and we will continue to pursue engaging impactful journalism without fear or favor." (Murray and Bezos did not reply to requests for comment.)</p>   <p><em>Post</em> Associate Editor David Maraniss, a legendary journalist whose association with the newspaper stretches back more than four decades, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/davidmaraniss.bsky.social/post/3lj3o3ozerc2d" target="_blank"><u>wrote on Bluesky</u></a> that he would never write for it again as long as Bezos owns it.</p>   
   <p>"One pernicious step after another, Bezos encroached on the <em>Post</em> editorial policy," Maraniss wrote. "Today he seized it fully. The old <em>Washington Post</em> is gone."</p>   <p>Former senior managing editor Cameron Barr, who had been editing projects for the paper, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/cameron-barr-72093bb0_today-i-am-ending-my-professional-association-activity-7300598172819546112-TjW-?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAB91b0BakuuTKmXlgSzUTCFIqDVZDWUq6o" target="_blank">announced on LinkedIn that he was severing ties with the <em>Post</em></a>. He wrote that Bezos's changes amount to "an unacceptable erosion of its commitment to publishing a healthy diversity of opinion and argument."</p>   <p>One writer for the opinions section told NPR he was "heartsick," adding, "leadership matters."</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RESNX-S1-5309725-101" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>NPR spoke to six people with direct knowledge of events for this article. They were given the ability to speak anonymously because they were not authorized to speak about internal matters at the paper.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RESNX-S1-5309725-102" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>Shipley did not respond to requests for comment. According to a person with direct knowledge, Shipley told Bezos that the new approach would violate the <em>Post</em>'s promise of holding power to account.</p>   <h3>Bezos new approach differs dramatically  from first Trump term</h3>   <p>Bezos stood by the newspaper's dogged reporting on the first Trump administration. In that period, the <em>Post </em>adopted the motto "Democracy Dies in Darkness." It won Pulitzer Prizes for coverage of the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/pr/2022/05/09/pulitzer-prize-public-service/" target="_blank">Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol</a> and, earlier, of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/national/wp/2018/04/16/feature/washington-post-wins-pulitzer-prizes-for-roy-moore-investigation-russia-reporting/" target="_blank">Russian interference</a> in the 2016 presidential election.</p>   <p>His business interests, however, have billions of dollars in dealings with the federal government. And Trump's regulators have made clear they intend to take an active role. </p>   <p>Bezos' decision in October to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/25/nx-s1-5165353/washington-post-presidential-endorsement-trump-harris" target="_blank">kill the Harris editorial</a> sparked a furor inside and outside the paper, leading editorial writers to resign and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/04/nx-s1-5248299/cartoonist-quits-wapo-over-bezos-trump-cartoon-washingtonpost" target="_blank">more than 300,000</a> people to cancel their digital subscriptions in a matter of days. (The <em>Post </em>says it has been able to win some subscribers back and garner some new subscribers in the opening weeks of Trump's second term.)</p>   <div id="resg-s1-50914">

                David Shipley resigned as opinions editor of <em>The Washington Post</em> after owner Jeff Bezos declared he wanted the section to focus only on supporting "personal liberties and free markets." In this 2024 photo, Shipley and the newsroom celebrate winning three Pulitzer Prizes.

   <p>As a practical matter, Shipley argued to Bezos, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>'s highly pro-markets pages have had a similar policy for decades. As with the decision not to publish the endorsement of Harris, Shipley's arguments fell on deaf ears.</p>   
   <p>In his memo to staff, Bezos praised Shipley and wrote that he offered the editor the chance to lead the reformed sections. "I suggested to him if the answer wasn't 'hell yes,' then it had to be 'no,'" Bezos wrote.</p>   <p>The <em>Post</em> has aggressively covered the new administration. But Bezos appears to have embraced the president's return to power. Bezos personally paid $1 million toward Trump's inaugural fund. He and his fianc√©e Lauren S√°nchez traveled to Trump's Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, to socialize with the Trumps. And, along with other digital chieftains, Bezos sat behind the president as he was sworn in for a second term.</p>   <h3>Opinions editor repeatedly in tough spot</h3>   <p>Shipley's two-and-a-half years have brought acclaim for the section, with two Pulitzer Prizes and two Loeb Awards. But his standing was deeply undercut by Bezos's recent decisions, especially over the Harris endorsement.</p>   <p>When Shipley decided to withhold a cartoon from the Pulitzer-winning staffer Ann Telnaes about Bezos from publication, he told colleagues he believed he was making a decision on the merits, not pulling his punches. The cartoon depicted Bezos abasing himself along with other tech titans before Trump.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RESNX-S1-5309725-103" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>"Not every editorial judgment is a reflection of a malign force," Shipley said in a statement shared at the time with NPR. "My decision was guided by the fact that we had just published a column on the same topic as the cartoon and had already scheduled another column ‚Äî this one a satire ‚Äî for publication. The only bias was against repetition."</p>   <p>Shipley told colleagues privately that he understood, given the moment, it might be hard to credit his actual motivations.</p>   <p>The paper <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/26/nx-s1-5166062/washington-post-endorsement-controversy" target="_blank">has bled veteran talent</a> from both the opinion and news sides since the news broke about the killed editorial. <em>Post</em> journalists left for the <em>Atlantic</em>, the <em>New York Times</em>, the<em> Wall Street Journal</em>, and CNN among other outlets.</p>   
   <p>But <em>Post </em>Publisher and Chief Executive Will Lewis celebrated the change in direction on Wednesday. Lewis previously served for six years in the same role at the <em>Journal</em>, which is owned by Trump ally and conservative media magnate Rupert Murdoch. He has advocated for a similar approach at the <em>Post</em>. </p>   <p>Bezos hired Lewis, in significant part, due to his belief the British journalist could build better bridges to Trump and to conservatives. As well as serving Murdoch as an executive for a decade, Lewis was previously editor of the conservative <em>Telegraph </em>in the U.K. and later served as a consultant for Tory Prime Minister Boris Johnson.  </p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RESNX-S1-5309725-104" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>"I am very excited about this new clarity and transparency, and cannot wait to see it brought to life in our opinion section. Every Day," Lewis said in a note to staff. "This is not about siding with any political party. This is about being crystal clear about what we stand for as a newspaper. Doing this is a critical part of serving as a premier news publication across America and for all Americans."</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Fire Red Agent</h2><a id="user-content-fire-red-agent" aria-label="Permalink: Fire Red Agent" href="#fire-red-agent"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Overview</h2><a id="user-content-overview" aria-label="Permalink: Overview" href="#overview"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This is my attempt at getting a large language model to play Pok√©mon FireRed autonomously. My bot has rudementery capabilities to play the game, explore, battle, and respond to game events.</p>
<p dir="auto">To me, this is the future of TV. While building the bot, I felt like I was producing television more than I was programming a computer. Ultimately, I ran into some technical hurdles around programmatic input control, which led me to pause development.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://f005.backblazeb2.com/file/fire-red-agent/FIRE_RED_PROMO.mp4" rel="nofollow">Watch the demo video.</a>
<a href="https://f005.backblazeb2.com/file/fire-red-agent/HD+project+walkthrough+(taylors+version).mp4" rel="nofollow">Watch the technical deep dive.</a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How It Works</h2><a id="user-content-how-it-works" aria-label="Permalink: How It Works" href="#how-it-works"></a></p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Emulator Integration</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">I used <a href="https://www.retroarch.com/" rel="nofollow">RetroArch</a> to run Pok√©mon FireRed. I struggled with sending inputs programmatically. RetroArch has a UDP-based input system (<a href="https://docs.libretro.com/library/remote_retropad/" rel="nofollow">RetroPad</a>), but I couldn't get it to work reliably.</p>
<p dir="auto">Instead, I resorted to using <a href="https://ss64.com/mac/osascript.html" rel="nofollow">OSA Script (AppleScript)</a> to send keyboard events to the emulator, which meant the game had to be in focus. This was a huge limitation because it took over my entire computer, making background work impossible.</p>
<ol start="2" dir="auto">
<li>Game Memory Management</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">I stored game state in a database, treating it like a diary of the AI‚Äôs experiences. The system recorded actions the AI attempted, what worked, what didn‚Äôt, and adjusted accordingly.</p>
<p dir="auto">There were four different types of memories, and the AI pulled the most recent 250 to maintain context. If an action failed‚Äîlike trying to walk somewhere and hitting an obstacle‚Äîthe AI would remember and avoid making the same mistake.</p>
<ol start="3" dir="auto">
<li>Navigation &amp; Pathfinding</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">The AI needed to figure out where to go in the game world. I extracted map data by reading game memory from RetroArch. I then used a pathfinding algorithm to determine the best route. The AI only considered valid movement options based on tiles and available paths. If stuck, it defaulted to trying adjacent moves (e.g., "walk south", "walk east", etc.).</p>
<ol start="4" dir="auto">
<li>Game Text Parsing</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">To understand the game, the AI needed to read in-game text. Since I wasn‚Äôt using direct memory extraction for text (as advised by <a href="https://pret.github.io/" rel="nofollow">PRET</a>), I took screenshots at key points and processed them with OCR.</p>
<p dir="auto">This allowed the AI to understand NPC conversations, menu prompts, and other critical game events. This was super important, as it guided the LLM to know what to do next.</p>
<ol start="5" dir="auto">
<li>LLM Integration</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">I used OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4o to process all the gathered information and make decisions.System prompts guided the AI to avoid repeated actions (e.g., trying to pick Charmander before meeting Professor Oak multiple times). The model received structured data about current location, possible actions, game memories, and navigation options. I experimented with frequency and presence penalties to encourage varied behavior and prevent getting stuck in loops.</p>
<ol start="6" dir="auto">
<li>Battle Handling</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">The battle handler was quite naive. All it was doing was pressing A. if the battle lasted longer than a minute, we began sending some random inputs to get out of the battle. This was an area I wanted to improve, but my priority was getting the AI to navigate the world first.</p>
<ol start="7" dir="auto">
<li>Interaction &amp; Conversation Handling</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">When talking to NPCs, the AI needed to determine if it should continue the conversation or move on. The conversation handler took screenshots, extracted text, and checked whether dialogue was still ongoing.</p>
<p dir="auto">If the AI detected text, it continued pressing A. If no new text appeared, it moved on to the next part of the script.</p>

<p dir="auto">The biggest hurdle was sending inputs to the emulator.</p>
<p dir="auto">RetroArch‚Äôs UDP input (RetroPad) didn‚Äôt work for me.</p>
<p dir="auto">Keyboard-based input (OSA Script) required focus, making automation impractical.</p>
<p dir="auto">Python-based solutions (like PiBoy) exist, but I prefer Ruby and struggled with existing Python tools freezing up.</p>

<p dir="auto">This project was both a nightmare and a ton of fun. As LLMs get better this is only going to get easier. I believe that Claude Plays Pokemon isn't doing any of the memory parsing I spent a ton of time, they are just streaming the memory directly to Claude 3.7 and it is figuring it out ü§Ø. If you find this work interesting, feel free to fork it, modify it, and build something even better!</p>

<p>Your camera has the ability to take three dimensional photos. Your screen has the ability to display three dimensional photos. You‚Äôve probably never used either. This isn‚Äôt a hidden feature of some new phone hardware release, it‚Äôs a feature of your brain. All your brain needs to see in 3D is two pictures, and you can trick your brain into seeing 3D on a flat screen using just your eye muscles. I will teach you how. I‚Äôll also tell you why you should.</p>



<h2>Binocular Vision, and Faking It</h2>



<p>Around a third of your brain is devoted to vision, and accordingly, it is amazing at it. From just the two small 2D images that are sent to your brain from the backs of your eyeballs, your brain reconstructs the entire 3D scene that you experience when you look around. Because your eyes are a few inches apart, they see two different views of the same scene, and those two views are all your brain needs. Distance causes objects to shift relative to each other when you see them from different angles. You can see this most clearly by moving your head from side to side and watching how things move. Your brain uses that discrepancy between the two views of your two eyes to reconstruct depth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Because your brain has this power, all you need to do to see an image in 3D is to send different images to each eye. It doesn‚Äôt matter how you do it. Every 3D display technology works this way, the only difference between them is how they get each image to only one eye.</p>



<p>Red/Blue 3D glasses filter out images that have the same color as the plastic lens. Modern 3D movies use polarizing filters, but the principle is the same. Two images are projected using orthogonal polarizations of light, and are filtered out by lenses in the glasses with the opposite polarization. Holograms show different images at different angles, and your eyes are at different angles. VR goggles put separate images on the screens in front of each eye that correspond to the views of two eye-spaced cameras in the virtual world.</p>



<h2>Seeing Cross Views</h2>



<p>If you don‚Äôt have any fancy technology, that doesn‚Äôt matter. You have eyes, a camera, eye muscles, and a brain, and it turns out that‚Äôs all you need.</p>

<p>If you have two images that show the views from two different positions, all you have to do to see the objects in 3D is to have one eye look at one image, and the other eye look at the other, and your brain will do the rest. You can do this either by crossing your eyes a little bit, or diverging your eyes a little bit. Most people have only ever deliberately controlled their eye muscles to cross their eyes, so find that to be easier. Accordingly most stereograms are designed to look correct when you cross your eyes. To use the other method the images have to be swapped or the 3D effect will be inverted.</p>

<p>Doing it correctly feels like this: First the images split in two, and you‚Äôll see flickering blurry copies of both images slightly offset from each other. Then as you cross your eyes more, eventually the two images in the middle will align. The center image will resolve into a clear 3D image, with two flickering copies of it next to them.</p>



<p>If you aren‚Äôt sure how to do this, there are two good ways. The easiest, if you are comfortable crossing your eyes, is just to cross your eyes slowly, so you can stop when the images align. If you aren‚Äôt comfortable crossing your eyes, then the best way is to focus on something in front of the picture, and hope that the images align on top of each other as a side effect. You can do this by holding your finger substantially in front of the image, and focusing solely on the finger with your eyes, while turning your mind‚Äôs attention to the image behind it while keeping your eyes still. This is hard to do right, so it might be easier to learn to cross your eyes first.</p>



<h2>Making Cross Views</h2>



<p>All you need is two pictures taken from two different positions shifted horizontally. The easiest way to do this is to take a picture, take a small step to the left or right, and take another picture. If the object is close, you only need to move the camera a few inches. If the object is far away you may need to take a full step to the side. How far you step will determine how strong the depth effect is, which is ultimately a matter of taste. A stronger depth effect makes the result more dramatic, but makes the image harder to resolve when you cross your eyes.</p>

<p>To turn the image into a cross view, you just need to put the images next to each other. Any way you do this is fine, even just looking at the two pictures next to each other in your camera roll. If the 3D effect looks backwards, just swap the images. There is free software that can do a better job by aligning the images automatically, adding borders, and allowing easy adjustments, <a href="https://stereo.jpn.org/eng/stphmkr/">Stereo Photo Maker</a> for Windows or OSX, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kra2008.crosscam">Cross Cam</a> for Android.</p>



<h2>Why bother? Isn‚Äôt 3D just a gimmick?</h2>



<p>3D has mostly been a gimmick. 3D movies use the depth effect mainly to throw things at you and make you flinch, not to add to the art. But every sense we have should have art in it, and our depth perception has been shortchanged. Depth is such an immature medium that we haven‚Äôt gotten past the kind of whiz bang novelty of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Arriv%C3%A9e_d%27un_train_en_gare_de_La_Ciotat">The Arrival of the Train</a>. (Notable exceptions to this are Avatar and Half Life: Alyx, which are enormously enhanced by being in 3D.) It is a huge part of how we experience the world, we shouldn‚Äôt give up on it.</p>



<p>There are some things that just can‚Äôt look the same without depth. To photograph a forest, and convey anything like the experience of being there, you need the world to give you other visual cues to add depth to the image, like fog. The world usually doesn‚Äôt do this, and as a result nearly every photograph of a forest looks like a flat disorganized mess. Add depth, and suddenly all the complexity and beauty reappears. You can show people what a forest is for the first time.</p>

<p>To photograph a cave, and convey the layers and scale of the rock, you need clever lighting, and even then it usually fails. The geometry of a cave is too unusual for cues like lighting and shadow to work reliably. The rocks are all the same color. Add depth, and there is no more ambiguity. The shapes take shape.</p>

<p>Depth literally adds another dimension to the composition. You‚Äôre no longer just positioning objects to lead the eye around the page, but also to lead the eye through space. What compositions could we create with this? Architecture or stage plays probably have more to tell us about this than visual art does. But it‚Äôs mostly still brand new and wide open. Go explore!</p>

<h2>Parallel Views</h2>



<p>If you are able to diverge your eyes instead of crossing them, then arranging the images the opposite way can give you a more relaxing and more natural stereo effect. This corresponds to focusing past the image instead of in front of it. There is an upper limit to how far you can physically diverge your eyes, they can‚Äôt go past infinity, so parallel view images need to be smaller to take up less of your viewing area.</p>

Ordinarily, we might associate the sensation with passing strangers on the street, but recently I‚Äôve been experiencing it most intensely when looking at old photographs. </span></p><p>Which brings me to the work of a little-known photographer, Frederick Monsen.</p><p>Monsen was born in Bergen, Norway, in 1865, but emigrated with his parents to Utah Territory when he was only three. He grew up in the West during the time for which it is most famous, when it was adventurous, wild, and still dangerous. As a teenager, Monsen became fascinated with the new art form of his day, photography, and was soon accompanying land surveys as an informal tagalong, helping shoot the landscape and its inhabitants. Soon it became a full time vocation and he joined expeditions heading to Alaska, Yukon, and Central America. But the area that became his speciality was the American Southwest; he was drawn back to its deserts, mesas, and canyons again and again over the course of his life.</p><p>Over the course of those decades, Monsen became deeply fascinated with the Native Americans of that region, eventually joining a group of other photographers (together known as the ‚ÄòPasadena Eight‚Äô) in documenting their way of life before it was changed irrevocably. Fortunately, by the time Monsen began his ethnographic project, which spanned the years 1886-1911, Kodak had developed a handheld box camera as well as roll and cartridge film, making it easier than ever before to be spontaneous in shooting film. Hence, the Norwegian-American was able to capture his subjects in more natural, candid moments, contrasting the more typical stiff and staged shots that were common at the time.</p><p>Across Arizona, California, Nevada, and New Mexico, Monsen documented the people and landscapes of the land he loved most. He captured his subjects, whether Navajo, Tigua, Apache, Hopi, Zuni, surveyors, prospectors, Mormons, missionaries, pioneers, or fortune seekers, with a degree of pathos that‚Äôs rare from that era of photography.</p><p>As you look through his images below, you may find yourself realising that all of those faces once belonged to people whose lives were as rich and varied as your own. It may occur to you that nothing besides remains of their stories, except perhaps these images and Monsen‚Äôs scrawled captions. Who were they? What were their hopes and dreams? Did they live full, happy lives? We can only guess.</p><h5><strong><span>(All photographs in this post are courtesy of </span><a href="https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/c869753j/entire_text/" rel="">Huntington

Link, who had spent most of the past half century playing gin rummy by the side of the pool at the Beverly Hills Hotel, in Los Angeles. For forty-two years, from the time he discovered the hotel, in 1950, until it closed, last December 30th, Irving‚Äôs days had been as well ordered and as predictable as the Sun King‚Äôs. At seven o‚Äôclock every morning, wearing one of the many perfectly fitted tropical-weight suits that have been a special affection of his since a memorable day in the nineteen-thirties, he would stroll over from his house, in the lower reaches of Beverly Hills; enter the hotel under the long, sloping green-and-white striped awning that extended all the way from the driveway, above Sunset Boulevard, to the main entrance; turn right in the lobby; and arrive at the Polo Lounge. Often he and the hostess, Bernice Philbin, would be the first two people there, and they would have a polite conversation before Irving took his place in his booth‚Äîthe first half circle to your left as you came in‚Äîand ordered breakfast: scrambled eggs back in the days when people ate eggs, and, more recently, banana and granola with skim milk.</p><p>Occasionally, when the weather was particularly fine, he would take his breakfast outside, under the great Brazilian peppertree on the curving flagstone Polo Lounge patio. Then, at around nine, he would stroll back through the lobby and follow the curving, carpeted stairs down to the lower hallway, where he would stop to say good morning to all the people in the downstairs shops: to Tony, the barber, for instance, who would just be laying out his razors and scissors, and Amir, the haberdasher, who specialized in cashmere coats with chinchilla linings, and who would often be at work on a new suit for Irving. Then Irving would walk out through the glass door at the end of the hallway into the all√©e of jacarandas and bougainvilleas that led to the Beverly Hills Hotel pool. He would wave good morning to Sven Peterson and his pool crew, who would be scrutinizing visitors from the safety of a small, tollhouse-style booth, and walk down the concrete steps toward the pool itself. One of the pool boys would scamper ahead to ‚Äúset up‚Äù a chaise for Irving‚Äîthat is, drape a flamingo-colored towel over the chair‚Äôs buff-colored vinyl‚Äîon the south, or sunny, side of the pool while Irving went over to his cabana, on the opposite side, to change into his swimming trunks. Then he would sunbathe for a few hours on the chaise. At noon, Irving would retire again to his cabana and change for lunch, which he would occasionally eat under an umbrella-shaded table in the Patio Club, or sometimes at the Bistro Garden, on Canon Drive, a favorite spot of his. After lunch, Irving would return to the cabana, change again‚Äîusually into what is called ‚Äúresort wear‚Äù‚Äîand set up a table just outside for the gin game. On any reasonably sunny day, the pool would by then be echoing with the names of well-known people being called to the phone, as well as with the names of unknown people being called to the phone by themselves in the forlorn hope that one day this would help them become well known, too.</p><p>From his vantage in front of his cabana, Irving could not only watch the parade go by but get the parade to sit down with him and play cards. Over the years, his gin game included Hollywood luminaries ranging from Tony Martin to such lesser figures as Ken Berg, the Koo-Koo-Roo King. Irving is an inordinately polite man, and words like ‚Äústarlets,‚Äù ‚Äúmoguls,‚Äù and ‚Äúkibitzers‚Äù never cross his lips; the world he saw was one in which, as he put it, ‚Äúmagnificent-looking young women, full of theatrical drive,‚Äù lay on chaises in order to impress many of the astute businessmen who had decided to ‚Äútake a fling in the picture business.‚Äù All through the day, Irving‚Äôs own business‚Äîa hard-to-follow mixture of liquor distribution, real-estate deal making, and all-around middleman stuff‚Äîwould be unhurriedly intertwined with all his other activities, like creepers rising on a trellis.</p><p>Irving would play cards until sunset. Most days, in fact, he and Sven closed the pool together. Then Irving would either walk back home to his wife and two children, or, after his wife died, in 1990, change yet again, and have dinner at the Bistro Garden.</p><p>Except for a brief period in the early sixties‚Äîwhen Irving, through no fault of his own, became trapped in the contest between Bobby Kennedy and Jimmy Hoffa and was in effect banished for a while by Kennedy from the Polo Lounge‚Äîone day of Irving‚Äôs has been almost exactly like the next. By the end of 1992, he had spent approximately fifteen thousand days by the side of the pool. (Irving has never learned how to swim.) ‚ÄúI guess I‚Äôm a creature of habit,‚Äù he says.</p><p>In recent years, people would come by the pool and ask to meet Irving, just so they could say that they had at last met a man who had it all figured out. His circle of admirers, probably larger than that of any other man who has spent his days by the side of a pool, extended from the pool boys (‚ÄúI‚Äôm in awe of him,‚Äù one of them said the week before Christmas, watching Irving sun himself on an icy Southern California morning. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs what‚Äîninety?‚Äù Eighty-seven, actually. ‚ÄúAnd he‚Äôs sunproof. He‚Äôs cancer-proof. What does he do? How does he make his money? How does he do it?‚Äù) all the way to Richard Koshalek, the director of the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art, who has admired Irving from an aesthetic distance, as though he were a Diebenkorn seascape. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one of the great performance pieces in Los Angeles history,‚Äù Koshalek says. ‚ÄúHe exemplifies something important about L.A., which is that the fragmentation of the city, which everyone always decries, also means that there are these remarkable subcultures all around, where people with very specific, amazing plumage flourish.‚Äù</p><p>Last December 30th, however, the Sultan of Brunei, who has owned the Beverly Hills Hotel since 1988, decided to close it‚Äîfor reasons that are either sensible and as plain as day, if you ask people who work for the Sultan now, or murky and irrational, if you ask people who were working for him up until December 30th. Officially, the hotel will be closed for renovations for two years‚Äî‚Äútwenty-four months‚Äù is the formula the Sultan‚Äôs people prefer‚Äîbut there are people who think that it may be closed much longer, or even for good. Irving now has to figure out another way of spending his days: Louis XIV expelled from Versailles and shuffling back and forth among other guys‚Äô ch√¢teaux.</p><p>‚ÄúThe Sultan is the only owner of the hotel in the past forty years who has not been a close personal friend of mine,‚Äù Irving said one morning in the last week of December, as he sat at breakfast in the now nearly empty Polo Lounge. ‚ÄúManny Borenstein, Ben Silberstein, Marvin Davis‚ÄîI played cards with them all. I wish the Sultan and I might have sat down together. My experience with potentates is larger than you might think. I once had a maharaja as a warm personal friend. Now, observing the Sultan‚Äôs policy, I‚Äôd say that he is a very astute businessman.‚Äù Irving toyed, a little sadly, with his banana and granola. ‚ÄúAnd in the long run what we all have to believe is that this sabbatical will prove to be an extremely astute move, and that we‚Äôll all be grateful when we recommence in two years. If it is astute, however, I don‚Äôt yet grasp <em>how</em> it‚Äôs astute. I run the figures through my head very often, and the project doesn‚Äôt cost out in terms of what he paid, what he‚Äôll have to invest, and how hard it will be to reassemble this‚Äîthis magnificent cast of characters and memories and associations.‚Äù He stared out the floor-to-ceiling windows at the peppertree, dominating the abandoned Polo Lounge patio. Then he went on, ‚ÄúOf course, what we‚Äôre all learning‚Äî‚Äù By ‚Äúwe,‚Äù Irving meant the hotel regulars, who are now being dispossessed‚Äîa group for which he serves as a sort of unpaid, ex-officio chairman, and on all of whom he has bestowed royal titles: Sven Peterson the Pool Prince, Bernice Philbin the Queen of the Polo Lounge, Chris Dunn the Crown Prince of Parking. ‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôre all learning is something new. Which is that if you‚Äôre a sultan it really doesn‚Äôt matter how astute you are. If you‚Äôre a sultan, you get to do whatever you want to do. Astuteness is somehow not your problem in life.‚Äù</p><p>Irving is one part Meyer Wolfshiem, one part Colonel Stingo, and eight parts everything your grandfather in Fort Lauderdale would dream of being if only he could get loose from your grandmother. He is certainly the best-dressed eighty-seven-year-old in America. He is slim, has beautiful, almost silver-white hair, a dashing white mustache, which recalls those of the rakish leading men of the forties‚ÄîCesar Romero or Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.‚Äîand a wardrobe that extends into new vistas of rococo elegance every time you see him. His appreciation of fine clothes is mostly untouched by narcissism. Spying an old friend just arrived at the hotel and wearing, let‚Äôs say, a white linen suit with a blue shirt and a flowered Liberty print tie‚Äînothing much at all, really‚ÄîIrving, dressed in a black cashmere Edwardian coat, chocolate kid gloves, and a camel‚Äôs-hair scarf, might pause before crossing the lobby and, after a warm handshake, say, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to come over too quickly. I was having too much pleasure in admiring that wonderful suit you‚Äôre wearing, and observing how perfectly you‚Äôve accessorized it.‚Äù</p><p>On the Tuesday of that last week, I met Irving at the hotel (we had become friends several years before), got into his gold Lexus, and drove off with him to have lunch at the Bistro Garden. On the drive, which, in the best Beverly Hills tradition, took us eight blocks, Irving began to hum. ‚ÄúOh, the days dwindle down to a precious few,‚Äù he sang under his breath as we waited at a light and looked out across the depopulated streets. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm thinking of moving to the Beverly Hilton. Have you seen it? It‚Äôs the white building on Santa Monica Boulevard. Merv Griffin owns it, and it seems to be a promising place. I‚Äôd be grateful to have your view. What I‚Äôm thinking of right now is: have breakfast at the Century Plaza and then move to the Beverly Hilton for the gin game in the afternoon.‚Äù The thought of breaking up his day seemed to depress him a little, and he sank into silence, until he spotted a mild, ferrety man slowly walking up Canon Drive. ‚ÄúNow, there‚Äôs a very good friend of mine,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOne of the most astute businessmen and lawyers in California.‚Äù He slowed the car and gave a honk on the horn. The man stopped and turned warily. He cautiously tried to make out who was inside the car, and then, spotting Irving at last, broke into a smile and gave a solid, official wave. Then he walked on. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my good friend the legendary Sidney Korshak,‚Äù Irving explained. ‚ÄúHe was Hoffa‚Äôs lawyer, and played a part in my dark years, which I‚Äôll tell you about at some point.‚Äù</p><p>We walked together into the Bistro Garden. Irving said a warm hello to the owner and then to the tuxedoed ma√Ætre d‚Äô, and took his usual table, on the edge of the garden. He ordered his lunch‚Äîbaked whitefish‚Äîand began to talk about how he had come to spend so much of his life at the Beverly Hills Hotel.</p><p>‚ÄúMy story begins on the Lower East Side of New York,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs where I was born, the ninth child of a rather important rabbi. I was the only one of the family who was born in New York‚Äîeveryone else had begun life in Vienna. My father died when I was twenty, and the truth is that I never really felt I knew him well, though he was, I‚Äôm told, an exceptionally astute Talmudic scholar, and he did like to play cards.‚Äù Irving smiled. He was wearing a navy-blue pin-striped suit whose stripes were outlined in gold thread; a hand-painted silk tie decorated in a soft pattern derived from Monet‚Äôs water lilies; a shirt with fine red checks and a white collar, and with the points of the collar edged in the same red check; a cream cashmere vest; and a pocket square in the same hand-painted water-lily pattern as his tie. Small gold threads ran through the pocket square, and his cuffs were closed with two shields of silver, with his initials, ‚ÄúIVL,‚Äù set into them, and a small stone to punctuate each monogram.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>In August, 1933, when he was twenty-seven, Irving married Nan Ofgang at his older sister‚Äôs house, in Brooklyn. ‚ÄúI had to borrow ten dollars to pay the rabbi,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe had nothing but guts and faith, and my wife had a job at the cosmetics department at the Thrifty Drug Company. I had heard from a friend, however, about a novelty company that had gone broke and abandoned a million units of a fortune-telling device in a warehouse in New York. This was called the Fortunscope. I borrowed money to lay claim to the inventory, and Nan and I decided to go on the road. There were a million Fortunscopes in that warehouse, and I was determined to sell them all. Now, the Fortunscope was a device in which you spun an arrow and found your fortune. All the fortunes were complimentary. I had a sample case, and would offer the Fortunscope to retailers. Once they placed an order, I would send it back to the New York warehouse, and Fortunscopes would be shipped to the retailer. It was a painstaking business: a gross to a department store, a dozen Fortunscopes to small five-and-dimes. I bought them for two cents and sold them for fifteen cents. In our first two years, we couldn‚Äôt afford sleeping cars, so we slept sitting up, in the day coach.</p><p>‚ÄúOh, those were wonderful days, though! We travelled from Philadelphia to Seattle, through the Middle West, Minnesota, and the various Dakotas. We were determined to visit every city with a population of more than twenty-five thousand. It was one day in some small city in one of the Carolinas‚ÄîI can no longer remember which‚Äîthat I was walking down a street and saw three magnificent Palm Beach suits in the window of a men‚Äôs store. One was cream, one was white, and one was navy. I went in and bought them all, eighteen dollars apiece. I‚Äôve tried never to be badly dressed since.</p><p>‚ÄúOur odyssey ended here, in California, where I took the stake we had made through the Fortunscope and went into the dress business. We liked California, but we both became homesick and decided to try moving back East. We actually found a house in Connecticut, and were ready to close on it. But then thoughts of California filled our heads. So we tossed a coin to see where we should go, and it turned up heads‚ÄîCalifornia. We came back out in 1949 and bought a little house here in Beverly Hills for six thousand dollars. By then my beautiful daughter, Gale, was born. I have a son, Rand, as well, who‚Äôs a dean at Sonoma State University. I‚Äôve always been an early riser, and so one morning‚Äînot wanting to wake my wife and children‚ÄîI slipped out of the house and went looking for breakfast. The hotel was at the bottom of the street, on Sunset Boulevard, so I slipped into the Polo Lounge and ordered breakfast, and my life at the hotel began that day.‚Äù</p><p>The Beverly Hills Hotel that Irving walked into that morning was, though Irving did not know it then, in the midst of a transformation. The hotel had been built in 1912, at a time when Beverly Hills was still essentially rural; in fact, the hotel was the first large building that the city had seen. It was decorated in the heavy, leadfooted style then called Mission Revival. The halls were uncarpeted, the rooms had exposed beams, and the hotel‚Äôs various amenities had a severe, purposeful look: the swimming pool was a place where people went to go swimming, and the Polo Lounge, which had been christened by Will Rogers, looked more or less like the kind of rough-hewn place in which you might actually wish to lounge after playing polo.</p><p>By 1941, the hotel had been in and out of bankruptcy, and it was bought by a consortium of show-business people headed by the banker Hernando Courtright, who decided to have the place remodelled in the style today loosely referred to as Deco but actually called by experts Coffee Shop Moderne. Courtwright had a new wing built along Crescent Road, on the east side of the hotel, and the interior of the hotel was redesigned: its hard Spanish angles were rounded off, and it became a paradise of curving stairs, recessed lighting, and pink and green stucco. The Fountain Coffee Shop, with its famous black S-shaped counter, was installed downstairs. A thirty-foot-high sign‚Äî‚ÄúThe Beverly Hills‚Äù inscribed in low relief in a looping, almost feminine cursive hand‚Äîwas visible from Sunset.</p><p>It was during this period that the Beverly Hills Hotel pool achieved its familiar form. The pool was set in a tropical garden. On the eastern and western edges were three rows of lounge chairs; each group of three chairs was punctuated by a small table topped with translucent glass, and a telephone rested upon each table. At the north end, a small white fountain played all day. To the south, behind a hedge of lime trees in white urns, lay the Patio Club: ten white metal tables under umbrellas, with a small bar in the back, and eight shaded booths set into one side wall. On the west side of the pool were the cabanas‚Äîlittle tents with striped awnings, like jousting tournament pavilions. Each had a chair, a chaise of its own, and a small door leading to a changing room just behind. (A second group of cabanas was mounted, more discreetly, above the chaises on that side, nestled into a little overhanging promontory, like a Tibetan monastery; these upper cabanas were, by legend, favored by Elizabeth Taylor and Marilyn Monroe and other movie stars who were either too chubby to be looked at or too nude to be respectable.) The only sounds at the pool‚Äîaside from soft piped-in classical music and the sound of people being paged‚Äîwere the metallic whirring and put-put of the blender at the bar, preparing frozen drinks (it was a tradition for the pool boys to make the rounds of the chaises every day at two-thirty with sherbet freezes in the heraldic house colors, pink and green), the breeze in the palms, and the constant murmur of boastful, wheedling, confident monologue.</p><p>It is sometimes said that the heyday of the pool dates from the heyday of the great studios, but in fact its heyday was just after theirs: its high period occurred in the mid-fifties‚Äîthe era of Sam Spiegel (who stayed in the hotel for a long time) and Joseph Levine (who did, too) and Stanley Kramer and the other independent producers who began to assemble films from the ground up. It was the era of ‚Äúinternational‚Äù casts, freelance directors, and creative financing. There was a new kind of negotiating to be done, which required a neutral place to negotiate, and the place that a lot of people chose was the pool of the Beverly Hills Hotel.</p><p>‚ÄúNow, how I got my cabana had a great deal to do with what happened at the hotel,‚Äù Irving was saying. He and I had returned from lunch and were sitting together by the side of the pool. There would be no gin game that day; the regulars had all gone off to other hotels. The weather had turned unseasonably chilly; at certain moments, you could actually see your breath. But a solitary man in brown trunks, whom Irving referred to as the Hamburger Hamlet King, was lying bare-chested on a chaise on the other side of the pool. (‚ÄúIf you get yourself focussed in the sun,‚Äù he had said when we walked in, ‚Äúit‚Äôs actually quite warming.‚Äù) ‚ÄúLooking back, in later years, it‚Äôs quite remarkable that I got my cabana at all,‚Äù Irving went on. ‚ÄúWhat happened was that Hernando Courtwright, who was responsible for the renovation, sold the hotel in 1953 to a couple of gentlemen from Detroit‚ÄîManny Borenstein and Ben Silberstein. Silberstein was a lawyer; Borenstein was a very astute businessman.‚Äù Irving‚Äôs tone implied that Silberstein was not. ‚ÄúThey began to make a great deal of money. But Silberstein wanted to keep the profits for himself, and Borenstein wanted to plow the money back into the hotel. They quarrelled endlessly, for years, but neither could budge the other. Now, each had forty-five per cent, and two or three other people had the rest. Silberstein‚Äôs sister, for instance, owned two per cent. That turned out to be important, as you‚Äôll see. They agreed to sell‚ÄîBorenstein to Silberstein. Silberstein got a good deal, and Borenstein, as part of the package, got a ten-year lease, for no money, on a suite and a cabana. But his cabana was next to Silberstein‚Äôs, and by that time there was so much bad blood between them that he didn‚Äôt want to be anywhere near Silberstein, so he gave the cabana to me. We were friends. I had begun the gin game several years before, and Manny enjoyed it.</p><p>‚ÄúSo, because of the ill feeling and misunderstanding between Borenstein and Silberstein, I had my cabana, when only two or three years later grown men would have killed for that cabana. There were thirteen cabanas, and in summer months they were almost impossible to get, even at a hundred dollars a day. A cabana meant power, it meant glamour, it meant that you had a place in the world. Everyone came to the hotel then. Every important personality in the picture business. I knew them all. Clark Gable, Tyrone Power, John Wayne, Buddy Rogers, Don Ameche.‚Äù Irving is essentially a democrat; Buddy Rogers and Clark Gable exist for him on more or less the same plane. ‚ÄúOrson Welles, Marlene Dietrich. How well I remember that memorable day when Dietrich broke the dress code in the Polo Lounge! Women were not allowed to wear slacks. It was an absolute prohibition. Now, Dietrich entered the loggia room in slacks.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúThey let her in. She was Marlene Dietrich, after all.‚Äù</p><p>The Hamburger Hamlet King jogged over‚Äîthere were goose bumps all over his almost purple tanned skin‚Äîand he and Irving began to talk. Then the Hamburger Hamlet King returned to his chaise and peremptorily summoned the one remaining pool boy. ‚ÄúCan you believe that? Only one,‚Äù Irving said. ‚ÄúNow, in those days the people who worked here at the hotel had influence. They had power. To get a good chaise from Sven, a good table from Bernice‚Äîwell, grown men would plead with me to put in a good word for them. Even the parking was competitive. Who parked your car. It was in the nature of the picture business, you see, to be like that. It is a nest of insecurities. Now, I have sat here‚Äù‚Äîhe waved toward the cabanas behind us‚Äî‚Äúfor forty-two years and watched the picture business, and the thing that I have learned about the picture business is this: Keep out of the picture business. They can strip you naked and leave nothing behind. I knew everyone who mattered in the picture business, and the ones who made real money were the ones who expanded beyond the picture business.</p><p>‚ÄúThe only time I ever really got involved in the picture business was when several gentlemen were making a picture with Hal Holbrook called ‚ÄòThe Kidnapping of the President.‚Äô They came to me to see if I could introduce them to anyone who could help with the financing. Well, at that point I wanted to do something surprising for my grandchildren, so I encouraged these gentlemen, and they offered me a bit part in the picture, as an Air Force general. When the picture came out, my grandchildren were delighted.</p><p>‚ÄúNow, I was explaining how the hotel came to be sold to the Sultan, which has led us to all this. You see, the two daughters of Silberstein inherited the hotel, and one of them, Seema, at the time of Silberstein‚Äôs death was married to Ivan Boesky. Boesky, who was also very astute, decided to sell the hotel. The sisters didn‚Äôt get along‚Äîthe Beverly Hills Hotel curse, you could call this. So he bought the two per cent the aunt still had‚Äîyou recall the aunt I mentioned?‚Äîand got it for himself. The balance had tipped, and now he could sell the hotel. There were two real bids: one from the Sultan of Brunei and one from my good friend Marvin Davis, whom I once tried to help buy CBS. Marvin‚Äîdo you know Marvin? Well, in addition to being a wonderfully astute businessman he‚Äôs‚Äî‚Äù Irving groped for a word. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a wonderfully Falstaffian figure,‚Äù he said at last, delicately. ‚ÄúWe had breakfast together once, and he asked me to teach him how to dress. I said, ‚ÄòDraw up a contract!‚Äô But he never did. Anyway, Marvin Davis explained to me that both he and the Sultan of Brunei offered a hundred and thirty-five million, but that Muriel wanted to sell it to an American rather than to a foreigner. So Marvin bought the hotel. But it was only after he bought the hotel that they pursued the due diligence‚Äîchecking the plumbing, the wiring, the corroding. He realized that it would take millions to fix it. ‚ÄòIrving,‚Äô he told me, ‚ÄòI made a bad deal.‚Äô Then he gets a call from the Sultan of Brunei. The Sultan is still dying to buy the Beverly Hills Hotel. ‚ÄòNot for sale,‚Äô Marvin says. He‚Äôs an astute Sultan, as sultans go, but no match for Marvin Davis. Marvin has nerves of steel. Of course, it‚Äôs much easier to have nerves of steel when you have money of gold. That‚Äôs a maxim of mine. So the Sultan ended up paying a lot more than a hundred and thirty-five million.</p><p>‚ÄúIt was too much to pay, of course‚Äîwhat the Sultan paid. People have a hard time understanding the hotel business. There‚Äôs an interesting sidelight to this story. Let‚Äôs go back to the late fifties, when Howard Hughes had three bungalows and twenty-one rooms permanently taken at the hotel, although he only visited for a few weeks each year. I used to observe Mr. Hughes going from one bungalow to another: one bungalow for Jean Peters, his wife; one for Hughes; and one for his mistress, who was rotated every month. Now, this is the interesting part. Ben Silberstein came to me upset, because he was going to have to throw Hughes out. Throw out Howard Hughes! I asked why. Because the rooms were not producing any income. No food, no services. Hughes thought that everybody must be holding him in awe because he had all those rooms, and in fact they were going to have to kick him out. So Hughes checked out, and went to Las Vegas. He was not terribly missed by any of us. My point is that the hotel business is not as simple as it looks. The Sultan owns the hotel, but he discovers that it needs work to bring it up to date. So he‚Äôll spend millions. The problem is that if you close the hotel and spend the millions, by then all the regulars will have moved on‚Äîto the Hilton, the Peninsula, the Bel-Air. Did I mention to you that I was thinking of moving to the Hilton? I should go over and spend more time there before I decide. But I hate to leave the hotel.‚Äù</p><p>In its last weeks, there were only a dozen paying guests left in the Beverly Hills Hotel; Sven Peterson at one point was even seen waiting on tables at the Patio Club. The doors to the unoccupied rooms were often left open for hours by the maids, and, peering inside, you saw a kind of anthology of forlorn, forgotten de-luxe styles: rooms lined with mirrors and Buffet-like paintings; rooms with wall-to-wall shag carpeting; rooms with ‚ÄúPersian‚Äù rugs and small terraces; rooms that looked like sets for James Bond movies; rooms that looked like sets for Doris Day and Rock Hudson movies.</p><p>Over the past twelve months, the decision to close down the Beverly Hills Hotel and remodel it has been much argued over in Beverly Hills, but, Beverly Hills being Beverly Hills, the argument has taken a peculiarly Beverly Hills form, with much of the argument conducted in the weekly ‚Äúgiveaway‚Äù papers. The Beverly Hills community, which is heavily Jewish, has always mistrusted the Sultan, who is, of course, Muslim, and whose little, wealthy country has voted against Israel in the United Nations, and this larger mistrust took the local form of suspicion that he and his minions intended to destroy the hotel ‚Äúlandmarks‚Äù‚Äîthe Polo Lounge and the pool, in particular. There were even dark rumors‚Äînot entirely implausible, given the shaky state of small Islamic principalities‚Äîthat the Sultan wanted the hotel remodelled in order to have it ready to use as a palace in exile.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Most hotel people, however, think that the Sultan is doing what the Sultan has to do. ‚ÄúThe whole thing began to come apart very quickly,‚Äù a hotel-business insider explained. ‚ÄúUntil the mid-eighties, there was a ninety-per-cent occupancy rate, and the hotel wasn‚Äôt even allowed to be booked by tourist agencies. But then the occupancy rate declined suddenly and precipitously. What was happening was that the clientele was dying off, and it wasn‚Äôt being replaced by younger Hollywood people. The occupancy rate dropped into the mid-sixties. And the competitive situation became intolerable: the Beverly Wilshire was upgraded, and then the Beverly Hilton. The Beverly Hills, by comparison, still had‚Äîwell, it still had window units instead of central air-conditioning.‚Äù (When you talk to Los Angeles hotel people, this issue comes up again and again: ‚Äúwindow unit‚Äù is always pronounced a little sotto voce, in a tone that might be reserved in other hotel circles for the term ‚Äúchamber pot.‚Äù)</p><p>Officially, the renovation of the hotel will include the construction of an underground parking lot and a reduction in the number of rooms. Each suite will have a ‚Äúluxury‚Äù bathroom, with a double marble sink and a television. A fax machine will be installed in every suite. ‚ÄúPeople‚Äîshow-business people‚Äîused to want a hotel that created an illusion of <em>leisure</em>,‚Äù one hotel man told me. ‚ÄúWelcoming your guest out onto the patio of your room for breakfast in your terry robe‚Äîthat kind of thing. The Beverly Wilshire, though, pioneered an illusion of power, which is what wealthy people, and particularly people in show business, want now. You‚Äôre in your suite, faxing stuff, when people come in. The hotel has to respond to that change.‚Äù</p><p>Although in the last few years the hotel made a halfhearted effort to promote itself as a kind of dowager empress‚Äîwith stories planted in the press about the history of the place, the enduring charm of Bernice, the unchanged d√©cor of the Polo Lounge‚Äîthat kind of nostalgic, ironic appeal seemed not to be very alluring to the powerful movie-and-television industry people the hotel was losing to the competition down the street. What veterans of the leisure industry call the South Beach Phenomenon, after the Miami Beach strip‚Äîa phenomenon in which what had been innocently luxurious to one generation then became slightly pass√© to an in-between generation, only to suddenly become fashionable once again, to a still younger crowd‚Äînever took hold in Beverly Hills. Richard Koshalek feels that this lack of historical affection is a typically Los Angeles phenomenon. ‚ÄúYou know, we based the entire color scheme of L.A. MOCA on the colors of the Polo Lounge‚Äîthat green and pink coloring,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt seemed to Isozaki, the architect, that they represented a kind of mystical, heraldic, symbolic coloring of Los Angeles. But it‚Äôs very hard to get people in L.A. to care about their own disappearing monuments. The hot-dog stand, the Brown Derby‚Äîthe things that have seemed to outsiders to define authentic L.A. culture‚Äîleave most moneyed people here very uneasy.‚Äù</p><p>Koshalek‚Äôs principle seems to be borne out by the evolution of the hotel‚Äôs clientele in its declining years. Movie people, the theory runs, tend to value extreme clarity in their lines of power and obligation. (One non-movie person who has regular dealings with movie people says that whenever a certain agent has even the smallest favor done for him, he immediately sends lavish and expensive gifts not only to the one doing the favor but to all of that person‚Äôs secretaries and assistants, whom in many cases he may never have met.) Hollywood is essentially a feudal society, and in a feudal society what matters most is that the feudal powers never put themselves in even a mildly ambiguous situation‚Äîthat they never run the risk of looking ridiculous. Hollywood people, this argument goes on, like to build their own, indubitably serious establishments as soon as they can‚ÄîI. M. Pei‚Äôs C.A.A. building is an example of this compulsion‚Äîinstead of taking over old ones. Irony‚Äîeven the kind of simple, nostalgic irony that involves appreciating the dated, period look of a slightly pass√© swimming pool‚Äîis a disruptive, cosmopolitan virtue, favored in cultures, like New York‚Äôs, in which the primary social skill is not obtaining a fixed place within a hierarchy but being able to enter as many circles as you possibly can.</p><p>Throughout the eighties, a number of ‚ÄúEuropean‚Äù hotels were opened in Los Angeles, with an eye to a New York crowd that was supposedly put off by the presumed tackiness of the Hollywood hotels, but those new, elegant hotels tended to be frequented by show-business types, while the Beverly Hills Hotel was the one that became a favorite haunt of New Yorkers. In recent years, the clientele of the hotel had become particularly heavy with professional ironists‚ÄîNew York art-world people. On one morning about two years ago, in fact, the only people at the pool (except, of course, for Irving) were a good chunk of the staff of the Museum of Modern Art‚Äôs Department of Painting &amp; Sculpture. William Rubin, the director emeritus, was down in the shallow end; his wife, Phyllis Hattis, was dangling her legs in the shallow end; Lynn Zelevansky, the senior curator, was sunning in a chaise (Kirk Varnedoe, the department‚Äôs current director, had left the hotel only a couple of days before). Lounging in chairs at poolside were the art dealer Larry Gagosian and the photographer Sheila Metzner. You can‚Äôt make a living on a crowd like that. Irving‚Äôs own notes on the hotel, from a set of recollections he has prepared about his life, record this change simply and plaintively: ‚ÄúPolo Lounge. Power breakfasts and lunches. Lines at night extended deep into lobby. Not anymore.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard very <em>encouraging</em> things about the breakfast at the Century Plaza,‚Äù Irving said. We were having coffee in the Polo Lounge one afternoon. He was dressed in a cherry-red turtleneck, high-waisted black slacks, and a black leather bomber jacket. ‚ÄúThe Century Plaza is very near where I live. What I ought to do is go there for breakfast one morning soon and try it out. I hate to jump off the deep end without a parachute. But that would mean giving up breakfast here, and I don‚Äôt have many left. The days dwindle down, dwindle down to a precious few. Everyone else is moving. The Bel-Air, the Peninsula, the Wilshire, the Hollywood Hilton. But I‚Äôm not ready to leave yet.‚Äù Irving was in what was for him a lugubrious mood. The day before,another of the pool regulars‚ÄîMark Goodson, the game-show producer‚Äîhad died. (The obituary in the L.A. <em>Times</em>, seeking to explain how Goodson had come by his forty-million-dollar fortune, pointed out that he had ‚Äúcreated a plethora of now-familiar television concepts‚Äîsuch as having contestants compete against one another; using the ‚Äòbell and buzzer‚Äô to signal which contestant answered a question first.‚Äù) ‚ÄúI never liked Goodson,‚Äù Irving said. ‚ÄúHe was the only man I knew who could strut sitting down.‚Äù But then he added, ‚ÄúStill, I hate to see the regulars dying off. He was only seventy-seven. Pretty soon, who will be left who really <em>knows</em> the pool‚Äîwho can bridge the gap between the pool‚Äôs closing and its reopening? There‚Äôs not going to be any continuity at the pool.‚Äù</p><p>I had been trying for a long time to get Irving to explain to me exactly how his business worked. ‚ÄúI live on finder‚Äôs fees,‚Äù he said now. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a middleman‚Äîa matchmaker. What I do is to bring people together, and take two per cent. For instance, that gentleman who‚Äôs staying in the hotel right now, the Hamburger Hamlet King? Well, I knew that an old friend who had created the entire Hamburger Hamlet concept was ready to sell, and from my network of friends I also knew who might be interested in going into the restaurant business on that scale. It isn‚Äôt simply pool people, but the pool people help. I‚Äôm a middleman, a matchmaker, an observer. I observe who‚Äôs ready to sell and who‚Äôs eager to buy.‚Äù</p><p>We had made a date for Irving to take me to see a couple of ‚Äúlandmark suites‚Äù‚Äîthe Boesky Suite, where Ivan Boesky had lived, and Suite 100, which was legendary as the place where Ben Silberstein had conducted what Irving refers to as his ‚Äúextracurricular activities.‚Äù But as we were settling the bill Irving said suddenly, ‚ÄúI suppose I ought to tell you that tragic story I started to tell you about, since it‚Äôs about my business. Well, it all had to do with the Teamsters. In the early sixties, I was making good money in real estate, and everything couldn‚Äôt have been clearer. Then my daughter had the bad luck to make an unhappy marriage to the son of a man who ran the Teamsters‚Äô pension fund. I took out a loan from him to invest in some real estate. It was all completely aboveboard and legal. But then Bobby Kennedy came to believe that he could put pressure on me to turn against my son-in-law and testify to terrible things. So one morning‚Äù‚ÄîIrving was becoming uncharacteristically agitated‚Äî‚Äúone morning Kennedy came into the Polo Lounge, right here where we‚Äôre sitting, during <em>breakfast</em> and shook his finger at me and said, ‚ÄòLink, you do as I tell you, or you‚Äôll be in trouble.‚Äô He didn‚Äôt even call me <em>Mr.</em> Link‚Äîjust pointed at me with that finger, and called me Link. So I held that finger, and I said, ‚ÄòMr. Kennedy, I don‚Äôt do what <em>anyone</em> tells me.‚Äô He was right, I was in big trouble. Bobby put the I.R.S. on me, and they ended up disallowing two hundred and forty-two thousand dollars in deductions. There was nothing illegal. Things like my son‚Äôs bar mitzvah, here in the hotel. They wanted me to testify, you see, and I had to protect my son-in-law. I had never met Hoffa. I was <em>supposed</em> to meet him, once. My son-in-law‚Äôs father wanted me to come to Washington and meet Hoffa. So I took a plane out to Washington. But I was troubled by an inner-ear problem in those days, and I got terribly, terribly sick on the plane. I damaged my clothes‚Äîa wonderful suit, in linen. When I arrived, he said, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt want Hoffa to see you looking like that.‚Äô So I never met him.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>‚ÄúBut my business was ruined. The papers picked it up, and, since I wouldn‚Äôt testify against my son-in-law, they made it sound as if I belonged to the Mafia. It stopped me dead. People believe what they read. I went from the top to the bottom. But I was never depressed. I‚Äôd done nothing wrong. The measure of a man, I think, is how he can accept adversity with dignity. I decided to hold my head high. I still came to the hotel every day. But I often ate at the counter, and I curtailed my gin playing.‚Äù By ‚Äúthe counter,‚Äù Irving meant the Fountain Coffee Shop, downstairs. ‚ÄúI was eventually reduced to taking a job. My brother-in-law was a liquor distributor, and I joined his business.</p><p>‚ÄúI was called in front of the grand jury four times. I took the Fifth. I went to visit my son-in-law‚Äôs father in jail one Sunday and told him I wouldn‚Äôt testify against him. He said to me, ‚ÄòYou dumb son of a bitch, what more can they do to me?‚Äô Here are the two cheering things that came out of this tragic episode, however. First, the enduring love of my children. Second, the friendship of Charles Z. Smith, one of the prosecuting attorneys. He knew that I was simply protecting my son-in-law. Mr. Smith and I became fast friends after the trial, and he is one of the most charming and delightful gentlemen I‚Äôve ever met. We correspond, and call each other for Christmas. His son and I have actually breakfasted right here in the booth, where Bobby Kennedy pointed his finger at me. Bobby, I believe, always wanted his own way, whether he was right or wrong. You know, he caused me so much strife, but I believe he was sincere. I was watching him in early 1968, and I said to my daughter, ‚ÄòYou know, I may vote for him.‚Äô She just looked at me.‚Äù</p><p>Irving and I left the Polo Lounge, crossed the lobby, and went to look at the Boesky Suite and Suite 100‚Äîwhich turned out to be just hotel suites, from which the aura of power and sensuality had long since fled. We walked back toward the empty lobby, and bumped into Kerman Beriker, the hotel manager, who had just left a farewell party given by the Sultan for the hotel‚Äôs employees. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a sad day, but it‚Äôs not final,‚Äù Beriker said. ‚ÄúEverything will be the same, Mr. Link, I promise you. New rooms, but the Polo Lounge will be the same, the swimming pool will be the same. It‚Äôs just‚Äîwe need a face-lift.‚Äù He dropped his voice. ‚ÄúWe still have <em>window units</em> in the rooms,‚Äù he said, and held his hands out, palms upward, in dismay.</p><p>A steady, melancholy procession of employees poured out of the Crystal Room, where the party had been held. First, a phalanx of Mexican and South American bellhops and maids, each clutching a pink plastic bag with the logo of the hotel imprinted on it. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a present from the Sultan in each bag,‚Äù Mr. Beriker explained. Then, after a suitable interval, the royalty of the hotel came out, all in mufti: Sven, Bernice, Chris, Robert the concierge, clutching pink plastic bags that held parting gifts from the Sultan. They gathered around Irving and talked in low voices. (Severance pay had been arranged for most of the senior staff, but no one had been promised a job when the hotel reopened.) Irving looked around the lobby. ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúI have an invitation to a gin game at the Peninsula. But I think‚Äî No, I‚Äôm just going home.‚Äù</p><p>On my last afternoon in the hotel, I went down to have a sandwich at the Fountain. A young black woman, with elegant, aristocratic features, wearing a T-shirt that featured the cast of the classic Warner Brothers cartoons‚ÄîSylvester, Tweetie, Bugs, Porky, Yosemite Sam‚Äîwas having lunch there, too. She was engaged in a conversation with the waitress behind the counter, who looked like a waitress supplied by Central Casting thirty years ago. The young woman gave the waitress a box. The waitress opened it, and exclaimed with delight when she saw that it was full of little sweet-potato pies.</p><p>‚ÄúThose are <em>good</em> pies,‚Äù the young woman said. ‚ÄúI knew you‚Äôd like them.‚Äù Then she ordered a sandwich. ‚ÄúJonny,‚Äù she said to the waitress, ‚Äúcan I have some ketchup and Tabasco when you come this way? And some chips?‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúKaren, I‚Äôll have to <em>send</em> for chips,‚Äù the waitress said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to give you these I have here.‚Äù</p><p>The young woman turned to me. ‚ÄúThis is the only decent food in this place,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúLast year, when I was working on my book about my grandfather, I lived over in the Crescent Wing and tried the room service. But it was awful. I‚Äôve been coming here since I was a little girl. My grandfather designed this hotel. His name was Paul Revere Williams, and he did all the Hernando Courtright-period remodelling, back in the forties. The Polo Lounge, the pool, the lobby, this place‚Äîall the color schemes and the staircases and the signage. They‚Äôre all his. Even the big sign out on Sunset. That‚Äôs his, too.‚Äù</p><p>The waitress brought over the Tabasco sauce and the potato chips. ‚ÄúThis has been a <em>horrendous</em> year for me,‚Äù the young woman went on, after introducing herself as Karen Hudson. ‚ÄúAll my grandfather‚Äôs papers were burned in the riot. This black S. &amp; L. where I work, and that he helped found‚Äîit burned right to the ground. So <em>that</em> set me back. But, fortunately, I‚Äôve got lots of other things in the house‚Äîhis house, where I live, which he designed for my grandmother. It looks like this place, a lot. The curves, the recessed lighting, the inside-outside theme, the color scheme‚Äîthat was the whole Paul Williams look. He‚Äôs just being rediscovered. My book‚ÄîI‚Äôm doing it for Rizzoli‚Äîwill be the first book about him. It‚Äôs funny how people are only just beginning to hear of him. He invented all this‚Äîtook every straight angle he found in the hotel and turned it round, made it graceful and elegant. But when I called the L.A. <em>Times</em> to get an extra copy of his obituary, they couldn‚Äôt find it. They said to me, very querulously, ‚ÄòHow do you know he <em>had</em> an obituary?‚Äô I said, ‚ÄòI know he had two. Because we had them in the family scrapbook.‚Äô He was the first black member of A.I.A. and their first black fellow, too. He was building houses here in Beverly Hills at a time when black people couldn‚Äôt even live there. It‚Äôs not true that he couldn‚Äôt stay here himself‚Äîmy grandfather would probably have been welcome. He came to the hotel a lot for balls and functions, and so on. But he never wanted to put himself in a position where he could be humiliated. One day when they were creating the pool out there‚Äîone of the engineers told me this‚Äîmy grandfather came out to talk to his crew, and he wouldn‚Äôt sit down. They thought, My God, the boss doesn‚Äôt want to come and speak to us. It wasn‚Äôt that. He would just never put himself in a position where he could possibly be humiliated. That‚Äôs why, though he designed hundreds of homes here in Beverly Hills, he would never live in one. Instead, he built his home in a black neighborhood, and always lived deep in the mid-city, in a black community.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>‚ÄúNobody knows exactly why he got the job. He practiced from 1915 to 1973, in just about every style known to man. He built hundreds of houses around here‚Äîhe had a completely adaptable, eclectic style. They‚Äôre all known, of course, by the pedigree of stars who‚Äôve lived in them. One of my favorite houses that he built is owned by a terrific couple who bought it from Raquel Welch. They‚Äôve got a room with a brass plate on the door: ‚ÄòRaquel Welch Memorabilia Room.‚Äô He really designed two masterpieces, though‚Äîthis place and the house I live in. I‚Äôll take you there, if you like. I‚Äôve tried to keep it unchanged.‚Äù</p><p>In Los Angeles, I had got used to jumping into other people‚Äôs cars and taking long drives to places I had never seen, so we went upstairs to the lobby, Karen got her car from Chris, and we set off. Along the way, she took me on a compressed tour of her grandfather‚Äôs work. He seemed to have designed every second house in Beverly Hills, in a bewildering range of styles: little absurd imitations of the White House; small, graceful bungalows done in a modified Frank Lloyd Wright manner; mini-Monticelli.</p><p>Then we drove south, through miles and miles of low, featureless buildings, and pulled up in a beautiful, palm-lined block that seemed to have been inserted, in one piece, from another, posher neighborhood. I asked Karen what part of Los Angeles we were in.</p><p>‚ÄúWell, I <em>think</em> this is called Wilshire,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúUntil there‚Äôs a police disturbance, and then it becomes South Central again.‚Äù She led the way to a small, nondescript fa√ßade on one corner of the block, and opened the door.</p><p>A small vestibule dominated by a staircase with a curved ironwork railing‚Äîrather like the staircase that leads from the ground floor to the pool corridor in the hotel‚Äîlay just inside. The railing was wrought in the image of three stags, chasing each other upstairs. On the far side of the staircase lay the living room, with a hearth of agate-colored stone. The right wall was entirely of floor-to-ceiling glass and looked out on a curving, gently terraced, kidney-shaped patio‚Äîa doll‚Äôs-house version of the Polo Lounge patio, almost down to the last flagstone. The entire interior was orchestrated around a series of graceful S-curves‚Äîthe curved living room echoing the curve of a green lacquered baby-grand piano, which, in turn, stood in front of a swelling built-in breakfront that filled an entire wall. The colors of the room were all subtly nuanced shades of emerald and moss‚Äîa quieter, domestic version of the Beverly Hills Hotel green.</p><p>‚ÄúLet me show you the Ben Mayer,‚Äù Karen said, and opened the breakfront. Inside its doors was a five-foot-long painted mural signed ‚ÄúBen Mayer‚Äù and dated 1951. It showed, in a spirited, cartoonlike style‚Äîhalf Stuart Davis and half Ben Shahn‚Äîthe story of the architect Paul Williams‚Äô life. A handsome black man in a perfect pin-striped suit, his wife, and their two little girls, in crinolines, filled the foreground. Behind the family was a montage, painted in uneven, shifting perspective, of Paul Williams‚Äô most famous buildings: a Saks Fifth Avenue branch on a boardwalk, a pair of New Orleans-style houses. To the upper right was the sign of the Beverly Hills Hotel, and below were scenes from the hotel itself‚Äîthe lounge, the awning, the pool. ‚ÄúThat was his handwriting,‚Äù Karen said, pointing to the cursive writing on the sign, faithfully reproduced in the painting. ‚ÄúHe just used it for the hotel.‚Äù</p><p>There was a single incongruous note in the mural. Above the beautiful family, a woman was depicted in black underwear, sitting, one leg drawn up, on the edge of a bed. ‚ÄúBen Mayer put that in for my grandfather,‚Äù Karen explained. ‚ÄúHe said he put it in because he and my grandfather agreed that prostitutes were the only people they had known who never discriminated against <em>anyone</em>.</p><p>‚ÄúBefore the hotel, my father‚Äôs biggest commission was the Al Jolson shrine. It‚Äôs this big memorial out at Hillside Cemetery. It‚Äôs funny, isn‚Äôt it? He made his early reputation commemorating a blackface entertainer.‚Äù</p><p>The living room was sunken, and the light came in from small windows facing a garden. I noticed that they were heavily barred. Karen caught me eying them.</p><p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs new,‚Äù she said, a little grimly. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had so many break-ins here. Just this spring, they broke in and stole <em>everything</em>‚Äîall my files, all my computers, and, what was worse, the computer disks. They steal them for the programs. That meant that I lost just about the entire manuscript for my book, and I had to start all over again. Oh, it‚Äôs been a horrendous year. The fire broke my heart. The S. &amp; L. where I worked was the oldest black-owned-and-operated S. &amp; L. in the city. My other grandfather, my paternal grandfather, opened it in 1947, and brought Paul Williams on at the beginning. In the Watts riot, back in ‚Äô65, everybody knew that it was a black institution, so it was left untouched. But not this time. It burned right to the ground that first night, with all the papers in it. I‚Äôve just had to write a new statement for our calendar.‚Äù She handed me the calendar. It read, in part, ‚ÄúBroadway Federal emerged from the ashes rededicated to the principles upon which it was founded. Fiercely committed to the belief in South Central and its viability for business, while understanding the importance of home ownership . . . Strengthened by your trust and support, we found many bright lights amidst the rubble.‚Äù</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Karen showed me around the upstairs rooms, which were simpler in d√©cor‚Äîa big Frank Lloyd Wright desk, a handsome faceted-glass chandelier‚Äîbut had the same signature lulling rhythm of curves and recesses. ‚ÄúHe lived here in such happiness with my grandmother,‚Äù Karen said. ‚ÄúHe was entirely filled with her. At work, he was a martinet, but around here all you ever heard him say was ‚ÄòYes, dear.‚Äô It moves me, because he usually worked in whatever style his clients wanted. But this style was obviously his real style‚Äîit was the style he loved. It‚Äôs so funny‚Äîhis most public building is done in this style, and his most private building is, too.‚Äù</p><p>I‚Äôd promised to say goodbye to Irving, and I was already late, so Karen drove me back to the hotel. As we turned the corner onto Wilshire Boulevard, I noticed, for the first time, that everything on the Boulevard looked odd. Not just empty‚Äîeverything always looks empty in Los Angeles‚Äîbut unnaturally dark, as though the gas stations and shopping centers had been crudely overprinted in woodcut.</p><p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all still burned,‚Äù Karen said softly. ‚ÄúNothing restored yet. That burned, and that burned, and that burned.‚Äù She pointed at the gas stations and supermarkets and little shopping centers; they were, I realized, all charred at their edges. ‚ÄúCan you imagine?‚Äù she said, shaking her head. ‚ÄúBut the house is still safe, thank God.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúAnd where will <em>you</em> go?‚Äù Irving asked me. He was lying on his chaise, all alone by the side of the pool. By now, the weather had passed from unseasonably chilly to just plain cold; I was in a wool suit. Irving seemed impervious to it all; he was stripped to the waist and was peering at the thin, distant, hazy sun with deep satisfaction, as though we were in Hawaii in August.</p><p>When I returned to the hotel, I had asked Irving if he knew that the pool and the Polo Lounge had been designed by a black architect named Paul Williams. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt,‚Äù he said, and he looked shocked. But then he said, ‚ÄúIf I looked surprised, it‚Äôs because I didn‚Äôt know that he had designed all <em>this</em>. You see, I knew the name, because he was the architect of the first house I lived in in Beverly Hills‚Äîthe one I was living in when I walked over here that morning. I never met the gentleman, but now I realize that my entire adult life has been spent within his precincts.‚Äù Irving looked suitably impressed.</p><p>‚ÄúAnd where will <em>you</em> go?‚Äù he asked again. I realized that he was asking what hotel I would stay in when I came back to Los Angeles, and that, for him, it was an important question. I didn‚Äôt know what to say. I vaguely remembered hearing from a friend that there was a nice hotel on a beach in Santa Monica, so I mentioned it.</p><p>‚ÄúReally!‚Äù Irving said, with polite surprise. He considered for a few moments. ‚ÄúWell, why not?‚Äù he said, at last. ‚ÄúOne of my maxims is ‚ÄòTry everything.‚Äô ‚Äù</p><p>On the patio, two producers were having what one of them had loudly billed as ‚Äúthe last Beverly Hills Hotel lunch.‚Äù Their voices barked out across the empty pool.</p><p>‚ÄúWhat do you mean ‚Äògood family‚Äô?‚Äù one of them was saying. ‚ÄúWhat does that mean? What. Come on, what? They don‚Äôt take drugs, they give money to the poor‚Äîwhat?‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúI grant you that the expression is clich√©d,‚Äù the other began.</p><p>I lost track of the conversation. Irving had walked over to the hedge of lime trees, and now he deliberately plucked a lime from a tree, walked back, and handed it to me. ‚ÄúHere,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúKeep this.‚Äù</p><p>I put the lime in the pocket of my suit, and brought it back to New York with me. I still have it.</p><p>I spoke to Irving just the other week. ‚ÄúThe Hilton turned out to be a pretty crummy place,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo I‚Äôve moved my entire life over to the Peninsula. Now something quite remarkable has happened there, which seems agreeably unexpected.‚Äù He paused. ‚ÄúThe entire royal family of Brunei has moved in here, including the Sultan‚Äôs brother! I helped them get rooms‚Äîthere are forty of them already, and eighty more are coming next month‚Äîand we‚Äôve become very good friends. They‚Äôre delightful, magnificent people. They‚Äôve reassured me immensely about the future of the hotel, even though I‚Äôve never met the Sultan himself. In fact, I‚Äôm coming to think that this time away from the pool may even be very invigorating and character-building. When we return to the pool, we may even appreciate it all the more, for having been kept away so long.‚Äù&nbsp;‚ô¶</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>How do we represent a rotation in 3 dimensions? This is a surprisingly deep question, and one we can learn a lot from. Our goal will be to ‚Äúrediscover‚Äù quaternions from first principles, building them up by exploring different representations and fixing the failures along the way.</p><p>Finding safe representations for 3D rotations has applications in a wide array of areas: 3D modeling software, robot path planning, space navigation, and medicine (e.g., representing the rotation of a scalpel in a robot‚Äôs hand), manufacturing, and really any field that works in 3 dimensions.</p><h2 id="3d-rotations">3D Rotations</h2><h2 id="euler-angles"><span>Euler Angles</span><a href="#euler-angles"><i></i></a></h2><p>Most people are initially exposed to 3D rotations through Euler angles: Yaw, Pitch, and Roll, so let‚Äôs start there. Below we see a gimbal with 3 rings, one for each Euler angle. In the computer we can represent each gimbal (colored ring) with a single value for its angle of rotation. Here is an airplane randomly rotating around, and we also see the associated Euler angles represented with the gimbals.</p><p><a href="https://jasonfantl.com/assets/img/posts/3DRotations/random_euler.gif"><img data-src="/assets/img/posts/3DRotations/random_euler.gif" alt=" Euler angles of a paper airplane moving at random " width="500" data-proofer-ignore=""></a></p><p>Every possible 3D rotation can be represented using Euler angles, but they have some issues. In certain orientations the system can get stuck in what is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimbal_lock">gimbal lock</a>, where the mechanism loses a degree of freedom.</p><p>When the middle (green) gimbal becomes parallel with the outer-most gimbal (red), then the inner-most gimbal (blue) aligns with the outer-most gimbal, making one of them redundant and the system loses a degree of freedom. You can see below how if you wanted to rotate the airplane along the plane of the screen, you wouldn‚Äôt be able to.</p><p><a href="https://jasonfantl.com/assets/img/posts/3DRotations/gimbal_lock.png"><img data-src="/assets/img/posts/3DRotations/gimbal_lock.png" alt=" Gimabl Lock " width="500" data-proofer-ignore="" src="https://jasonfantl.com/assets/img/posts/3DRotations/gimbal_lock.png"></a></p><p>Near gimbal lock, some of the rings whip around violently. Here we see the airplane <em>almost</em> pass through such a rotation. In the first example the airplane is 10 degrees off from passing through gimbal lock, and in the second it is 1 degree off.</p><div><p><a href="https://jasonfantl.com/assets/img/posts/3DRotations/10_degree_euler.gif"><img data-src="/assets/img/posts/3DRotations/10_degree_euler.gif" alt=" Euler angles near the singularity " width="500" data-proofer-ignore=""></a></p><p><a href="https://jasonfantl.com/assets/img/posts/3DRotations/1_degree_euler.gif"><img data-src="/assets/img/posts/3DRotations/1_degree_euler.gif" alt=" Euler angles at the singularity " width="500" data-proofer-ignore=""></a></p></div><p>If we tried to rotate the airplane directly through the gimbal lock axis (at 0 degrees), the outermost gimbal would need to flip 180 degrees instantaneously.</p><p>Gimbal lock can cause real issues. On the Apollo 11 mission, astronaut Mike Collins had to manually reorient the spacecraft to prevent its Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) from entering gimbal lock. He jokingly <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/history/alsj/gimbals.html">asked for a fourth gimbal for Christmas</a>, which is one known solution to the issue. You can <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/history/alsj/e-1344.htm">read the original reasoning</a> as to why they decided to use 3 gimbals instead of 4. Here we see the actual IMU used in Apollo, as well as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_indicator#Flight_Director_Attitude_Indicator">Flight Director Attitude Indicator</a> which the astronauts would read to see the Yaw, Pitch, and Roll of the spacecraft. The red spot is the ‚ÄúGimbal Lock Region‚Äù, which if oriented this way, would cause the astronauts to lose attitude navigation, at least until they manually reset it.</p><div><p><a href="https://jasonfantl.com/assets/img/posts/3DRotations/Apollo_IMU.jpg"><img data-src="/assets/img/posts/3DRotations/Apollo_IMU.jpg" alt="Apollo IMU" width="600" data-proofer-ignore="" src="https://jasonfantl.com/assets/img/posts/3DRotations/Apollo_IMU.jpg"></a></p><p><a href="https://jasonfantl.com/assets/img/posts/3DRotations/attitude_indicator.jpg"><img data-src="/assets/img/posts/3DRotations/attitude_indicator.jpg" alt="Apollo IMU" width="600" data-proofer-ignore="" src="https://jasonfantl.com/assets/img/posts/3DRotations/attitude_indicator.jpg"></a></p></div><p>These discontinuities are not just an artifact of poor implementation; it can be proven that any representation of 3D rotations using only three values must contain discontinuities. We will just move on to another representation, but if you want more details, you can look into the proof that SO(3) is not homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^{3}$.</p><p>Our goal will be to create a representation of 3D rotations which does not contain discontinuities.</p><p>Although we just said that 3 values will provably result in singularities, there is another representation of 3D rotations using 3 numbers that is highly illuminating and worth looking at. This representation will be the building block on which we can rediscover quaternions.</p><h2 id="rodrigues-vectors"><span>Rodrigues Vectors</span><a href="#rodrigues-vectors"><i></i></a></h2><p>Another possible representation of rotations can be described by an axis to rotate around and an angle for how far to rotate around that axis. This rotation can be represented with a single 3D vector. The direction of the vector indicates the axis to rotate around, and the magnitude describes the angle. This also means that a vector will have a magnitude in $[0, \pi]$. Angles larger then $\pi$ can instead be represented as a smaller rotation around the opposite axis.</p><p>Here is the airplane rotating around each of the three axes and the associated Rodrigues vector for that rotation. We also look at random rotations to get a better intuition for what the rotation representation looks like.</p><p>We can immediately see discontinuities. While the airplane is rotating continuously, the vector can disappear off one edge of the ball and reappear on the opposite edge. This actually happens at all points on the surface of the ball. Every point on the surface of the ball is equivalent to the point on the opposite point of the ball, which in more formal terms is called ‚Äúidentifying antipodal points‚Äù. This identification represents the fact that a rotation by $\pi$ around a given axis is equivalent to a rotation by $\pi$ around the opposite axis.</p><p>This gives us a really weird space known as $\mathbb{RP}^{3}$. Imagine this universe where space wraps around at its edges to the other side, where if you walk in any direction long enough you end up back where you started. This almost feels like the sphere which has a similar property, but here in $\mathbb{RP}^{3}$ you would end up back where you started as a mirrored version of yourself. You can see what it looks like to live in $\mathbb{RP}^{3}$ with <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/tclGzl">this shader</a>. This space also describes the unintuitive <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgsUDby0X1M">Dirac Belt Trick</a>, which helps illuminate how strange this space is.</p><p>But it still has discontinuities, so what can we do about that? If we look at the same space, but one dimension lower, we can discover a useful trick that we can then apply to this ball.</p><h2 id="mathbbrp2"><span>$\mathbb{RP}^{2}$</span><a href="#mathbbrp2"><i></i></a></h2><p>A lower-dimensional analog of this space is a circle with opposite edges identified. You could walk off one edge and appear on the opposite edge (and like the ball, mirrored). There are actually many representations of this space you could use, some of which are covered in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBH-Id8VC3U">delightful old-school educational video</a>.</p><p>In our context, this space would represent 3D rotations where one axis is fixed in place. The direction of a vector in this circle represents a 3D axis to rotate around, and the magnitude represents the angle by which to rotate. Here we can see the airplane can rotate along only 2 of its degrees of freedom. We also color the edge of the space such that identified points are the same color.</p><p>In this more basic space we can use a clever trick to remove the discontinuities. It‚Äôs not possible to embed (read as ‚Äústretching‚Äù) this space in 3D such that opposite sides of the disk are connected. Although, you can immerse it (read as ‚Äústretching with intersections allowed‚Äù), which I encourage you to try since it‚Äôs a bit mind-bending. What we do to remove the discontinuities is create a second copy of the space and connect the edge on one copy to the opposite edge on the second copy, which can be done by rotating the second copy 180 degrees and connecting the edges together.</p><p><a href="https://jasonfantl.com/assets/img/posts/3DRotations/merge_spaces.gif"><img data-src="/assets/img/posts/3DRotations/merge_spaces.gif" alt=" removing discontinuities from the space " width="600" data-proofer-ignore=""></a></p><p>This can take a minute to understand, so please stare at the above and below animations for a sufficient amount of time. Below we see a rotation represented in three different ways: a rotated object, the Rodrigues vector, and the two points on the sphere made from the glued-together copies of the Rodrigues vector space. Notice how a rotation is represented twice on this new sphere, which is what allows it to be continuous everywhere.</p><p><a href="https://jasonfantl.com/assets/img/posts/3DRotations/all_representations.gif"><img data-src="/assets/img/posts/3DRotations/all_representations.gif" alt=" The 2D and 3D representations of the axis angle rotation " width="800" data-proofer-ignore=""></a></p><p>I also find it helps to think about a few key rotations. The ‚Äúdo nothing‚Äù rotation is the center of the circle (zero magnitude vector), which are the poles on the sphere farthest from the rainbow edge represented by the points $(-1, 0, 0)$ and $(1, 0, 0)$. A rotation around the X axis by 90 degrees is represented by the points $(0, 1, 0)$ and $(0, -1, 0)$. The first coordinate is the amount of rotation (representing 0 degrees with 1 and 180 degrees with 0) and the remaining coordinates (normalized) represent the axis we are rotating around.</p><p>A nice way to map a point on the disk to a point on the sphere is by $(\text{cos}(\frac{\theta}{2}), \text{sin}(\frac{\theta}{2}) \bf u)$ where $\theta$ is the magnitude of the vector on the disk and $\bf u$ is the normalized vector. Notice that the first coordinate is representing the angle of rotation like we wanted, as in, mapping a do-nothing rotation to $1$ and an 180 degree rotation to $0$.</p><p>And now that we have this trick, we can go back to the ball we had earlier with identified antipodal points.</p><h2 id="quaternions"><span>Quaternions</span><a href="#quaternions"><i></i></a></h2><p>We can take the mapping we used to turn $\mathbb{RP}^{2}$ into the sphere and apply the same mapping from the full 3D rotation space, the 3D ball with identified antipodal points known as $\mathbb{RP}^{3}$, into a 4D sphere. You take two copies of the ball, rotate one by 180 degrees, then connect them in the fourth dimension as a 4D sphere. This creates a 4D sphere, where each rotation is represented exactly twice as antipodal points. We can‚Äôt visualize this, but keep in mind that it acts exactly the same as the lower-dimension version we just saw.</p><p>This point on the 4D sphere is the quaternion that most people use to represent 3D rotations. When you see a quaternion from now on, you can recall</p><ul><li>The first coordinate $\bf q_w$ is the amount of rotation being applied around an axis. $\theta = 2 \cdot \text{acos}({\bf q_w})$, so the value 1 represents no rotation, and 0 represents a 180 degree rotation.</li><li>The last three coordinates normalized represent the axis to rotate around in 3 dimensions.</li><li>Each 3D rotation has two quaternions to represent it, $\bf q$ and $\bf -q$.</li></ul><p>I should mention that there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_formalisms_in_three_dimensions">other representations of 3D rotations</a>, including 3x3 matrices and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60z_hpEAtD8">bi-vectors</a>, but we focused on quaternions since they are one of the most common representations.</p><p>All the code used to generate the animations can be found <a href="https://github.com/JasonFantl/Blog-Post-Rediscovering-Quaternions">here</a>.</p><h2 id="fixing-the-gimbal"><span>Fixing the gimbal</span><a href="#fixing-the-gimbal"><i></i></a></h2><p>Recall that astronaut Mike Collins asked for a fourth gimbal in order to avoid gimbal lock and discontinuities, how does a fourth gimbal fix the issue?</p><p>For three gimbals we had a unique set of angles that represented a rotation, so by adding a fourth gimbal we enable a rotation to be represented by many different possible sets of angles. Below we see how the airplane is staying still while the gimbals can move (not at any angle, they still need to produce the desired rotation, but we still see how there is more then one way to represent a rotation with four gimbals).</p><p><a href="https://jasonfantl.com/assets/img/posts/3DRotations/steady_4_gimbals.gif"><img data-src="/assets/img/posts/3DRotations/steady_4_gimbals.gif" alt=" 4-DOF gimbal " width="500" data-proofer-ignore=""></a></p><p>With this additional degree fo freedom, we can now steer around singularities. Imagine we get too close to a singularity, then we just pause the object rotating and move the gimbals around until we‚Äôre farther from the singularity, then continue the rotation. But ideally, we don‚Äôt have to pause the rotation. There must be a way to map quaternions to 4-DOF gimbals that eliminates the singularities altogether. So, what does such a mapping look like?</p><p>It turns out, no such mapping exist, not even if we add more redundant gimbals. You can dive into the details if you like (theorem 1.3 in <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~bvchurch/assets/files/talks/Quaternions.pdf">these notes</a>), but essentially it is because it‚Äôs not possible to map a set of angles (represented by the space $T^4$) to the space of rotations ($\mathbb{RP}^{3}$) without introducing singularities.</p><p>But not all is lost. We can construct a function that maps the desired rotation <em>and</em> the current gimbal angles into the next gimbal angles. Essentially, this is a function that depends on where the gimbal currently is in order to determine where it should be next. This has the funny implication that we can rotate an object around and return it to its original orientation, but the gimbals may not be in the same orientation.</p><p>Below we see the airplane moving randomly as we adjust the gimbals to avoid singularities. Every frame we calculate the set of angles that maximizes the distance to a singularity (the determinant of the Jacobian matrix) while always satisfying our desired rotation.</p><p><a href="https://jasonfantl.com/assets/img/posts/3DRotations/4_euler_angles.gif"><img data-src="/assets/img/posts/3DRotations/4_euler_angles.gif" alt=" 4-DOF gimbal " width="500" data-proofer-ignore=""></a></p><p>Long ago NASA had <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/19860015697/downloads/19860015697.pdf">theoretical results</a> on 4-DOF gimbals (also called 4-axis gimbals), and since then there has been an <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C22&amp;q=singularity-free+gimbal&amp;btnG=">abundance of results</a> on singularity avoidance in gimbal systems of all kinds.</p><p>If you want to explore more on the movement of robots, I found <a href="https://www.cse.lehigh.edu/~trink/Courses/RoboticsII/reading/murray-li-sastry-94-complete.pdf">this textbook</a> very well-written and useful.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><article><div><p><span><p><span>The first time I spoke to Alexa, it felt like the future had arrived. I walked into the room, asked Alexa to play ‚ÄúA Sky Full of Stars,‚Äù and it just worked. As a product maker, it struck me that this was technology at its best‚Äîdoing what the customer wants effortlessly, intuitively, and naturally‚Äîand I wanted all the technology in my life to work that way. With 600 million Alexa devices now out in the world, the latest advancements in generative AI have unlocked new possibilities‚Äîenabling us to reimagine the experience in our pursuit of making customers‚Äô lives better and easier every day.</span></p></span></p></div><div><p><span><p><span>Today, we‚Äôre excited to introduce Alexa+, our next-generation assistant powered by generative AI. Alexa+ is more conversational, smarter, personalized‚Äîand she helps you get things done. She keeps you entertained, helps you learn, keeps you organized, summarizes complex topics, and can converse about virtually anything. Alexa+ can manage and protect your home, make reservations, and help you track, discover, and enjoy new artists. She can also help you search, find or buy virtually any item online, and make useful suggestions based on your interests. Alexa+ does all this and more‚Äîall you have to do is ask.</span></p></span></p></div><div><p><img alt="Echo Show conversation in motion." height="743" role="" src="https://assets.aboutamazon.com/dims4/default/3940e98/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1600x900+0+0/resize/1320x743!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Famazon-blogs-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F8e%2Ff6%2Fb6c5d6d943eea6091686d78a069a%2Finline001-aboutamazon-alexa-alexa-conversational-cx-hiking-reccomendations-1-1600x900.GIF" width="1320"><span></span></p></div><div><p><h2>Alexa+ is easy to talk to.</h2></p></div><div><p><span><p><span>Conversations with Alexa+ feel expansive and natural. Whether you‚Äôre speaking in half-formed thoughts, using colloquial expressions, or exploring complex ideas, Alexa+ understands what you mean, and responds like a trusted assistant. It feels less like interacting with technology, and more like engaging with an insightful friend.</span><br></p></span></p></div><div><p><h2>Alexa+ turns talk into action.</h2></p></div><div><p><span><p><span>At the foundation of Alexa‚Äôs state-of-the-art architecture are powerful large language models (LLMs) available on Amazon Bedrock, but that‚Äôs just the start. Alexa+ is designed to take action, and is able to orchestrate across tens of thousands of services and devices‚Äîwhich, to our knowledge, has never been done at this scale. To achieve this, we created a concept called ‚Äúexperts‚Äù‚Äîgroups of systems, capabilities, APIs, and instructions that accomplish specific types of tasks for customers.</span></p></span></p></div><div><p><span><p><span>With these experts, Alexa+ can control your smart home with products from Philips Hue, Roborock, and more; make reservations or appointments with OpenTable and Vagaro; explore discographies and play music from providers including Amazon Music, Spotify, Apple Music, and iHeartRadio; order groceries from Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods Market, or delivery from Grubhub and Uber Eats; remind you when tickets go on sale on Ticketmaster; and use Ring to alert you if someone is approaching your house.</span></p></span></p></div><div data-testid="RelatedContent"><p><a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/new-alexa-tech-generative-artificial-intelligence"><img alt="Alexa partner expert logos" height="200" role="" src="https://assets.aboutamazon.com/dims4/default/2016e23/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1688x1125+0+0/resize/300x200!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Famazon-blogs-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc3%2F06%2F6608b1cd46b7947fc2f8918289e2%2Fartifact-expression-2000x1125.jpg" width="300"></a></p></div><div><p><span><p><span>Alexa+ also introduces agentic capabilities, which will enable Alexa to navigate the internet in a self-directed way to complete tasks on your behalf, behind the scenes. Let‚Äôs say you need to get your oven fixed‚ÄîAlexa+ will be able to navigate the web, use Thumbtack to discover the relevant service provider, authenticate, arrange the repair, and come back to tell you it‚Äôs done‚Äîthere‚Äôs no need to supervise or intervene.</span><br></p></span></p></div><div><p><h2>Alexa+ is personalized to you.</h2></p></div><div><p><span><p><span>The new Alexa is highly personalized‚Äîand gives you opportunities to personalize further. She knows what you‚Äôve bought, what you‚Äôve listened to, the videos you‚Äôve watched, the address you ship things to, and how you like to pay‚Äîbut you can also ask her to remember things that will make the experience more useful for you. You can tell her things like family recipes, important dates, facts, dietary preferences, and more‚Äîand she can apply that knowledge to take useful action. For example, if you are planning a dinner for the family, Alexa+ can remember that you love pizza, your daughter is vegetarian, and your partner is gluten-free, to suggest a recipe or restaurant.</span></p></span></p></div><div><p><img alt="Echo Show Home screen" height="743" role="" src="https://assets.aboutamazon.com/dims4/default/30a6f49/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1125+0+0/resize/1320x743!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Famazon-blogs-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F65%2F78%2Fa2f287624e9e9c796fafe40e9362%2Falexa-home-screen-smart-home-calendar-widget-ui-3.png" width="1320"><span></span></p></div><div><p><h2>Alexa+ is there when you want it, and fades into the background when you don‚Äôt.</h2></p></div><div><p><span><p><span>The new Alexa is like having an assistant available to help any time you want‚Äîshe‚Äôs there when you need her, and disappears when you don‚Äôt.

Wishing you guys all the luck in the world!  Email in profile in case you wish to chat.</p><p>For all the naysayers, as a fusion startup, targeting the marine market is a good move.  They aren't even the first fusion startup to do so; IIRC Rostoker's group got their first major funding from the NRL. The marine market pays a premium for not having to refuel, and historically emerging energy technologies have early commercialization in ships.  This was true for fission in the 50s and for photovoltaic solar in the 70s/80s.</p><p>Now, sure, they have to make power to be able to sell it.  But to build a reactor, you have to raise funds, and in order to raise funds you have to show that you can make money if you are successful at making power.  Explicitly aiming at a market that might actually pay for overpriced power shows their investors that there may be a valid business case.  That doesn't make fusion happen any easier, but you don't make any reactions without first building a reactor.</p><p>You know, I'm sure these guys could work somewhere getting paid to get more people to click on stuff.  Instead they are taking a risk to do something that might be important.  Make no mistake: fusion founder is a tough gig.  There is no established off-ramp, and many fusion founders find that it's a job that can easily eat your career. I hope their plan B is in order, as well as their prenups and/or wills.  They are going off to fight a dragon that's eaten a lot of other people's careers, relationships and sanity.</p><p>As an aside, it's nice to see someone working on a tokamak actually not being overly optimistic about wall heat flux.

                  <p>Unlike what the nuclear Navy does today which is directly mechanically link the steam turbine to the propeller... we have the turbine spin a generator that creates a high voltage electric bus, which can than power a motor for propulsion. But you can 'easily' swap out the motor and tap off that HV bus for any other electrical load. Agree with all those other potential applications for mobile power at sea, there's a ton!

Plus, all that fuel occupies tonnage that isn't carrying paying cargo.

Technical? check. Big important problem? check. Technically credible on <i>this</i> problem? check. "Did $Thing at $Company" can help on that last point for obvious reasons, but the idea of some triple-bank-shot collusion/corruption with Big Political Players is just Too Much Internet.</p><p>This matters!

<p>As I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre aware, rivers usually combine together to make larger and larger rivers until they reach the sea.<br>However, there are some exceptions: rivers do sometimes split up and flow in separate directions.</p>



<p>These splits are called ‚Äúbifurcations‚Äù (bi‚Äù meaning ‚Äútwo‚Äù, and ‚Äúfurcations‚Äù being the forks). They happen most often when rivers are close to the sea, which forms deltas. These separate branches then reach the sea soon after.</p>



<p>These branches can also happen inland, where they will usually re-join again to form a river island.</p>



<p>However, in very rare occasions these branches can go off in totally different directions, and even into separate oceans.</p>



<p>The same phenomenon can also happen with lakes, where a lake may have 2 outflow rivers that head in very different directions. </p>



<p>Here‚Äôs a little image showing 4 different types of bifurcation:</p>

<h2><strong>The Casiquiare Canal</strong></h2>



<p>Perhaps the best example of a river bifurcation that links two different river systems can be found in South America.</p>



<p>The Amazon River system is the largest in the world, and, by a peculiar quirk of geography, it connects to the Orinoco river which is, by water volume, the 4<sup>th</sup> largest river system in the world. The Casiquiare Canal is a natural river that flows out of the Orinoco River and into the Rio Negro, a major tributary of the Amazon. It‚Äôs large enough that small boats can travel between the two river systems.</p>

<p>This leads us to an interesting question:</p>



<p>When a river splits and branches reach the sea soon-after, this creates a <strong>delta island</strong>. The largest delta island in the world is Maraj√≥ in Brazil, in the Amazon delta. You can actually see it on the right of my map above. At 40,100 km¬≤, it is considered the 35<sup>th</sup> largest island on Earth.</p>



<p>So what about the ‚Äú<strong>bifurcation island</strong>‚Äù created by the splitting of the Orinoco River into the Casiquiare? If a delta island is considered an island, surely this whole north-eastern region of South America should also be considered one? Like a delta island, it is surrounded entirely by sea and rivers. As <strong><a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/island">an area of land separate from a continent, permanently and entirely surrounded by water</a></strong>, it seems to fit every definition of an island I can find.</p>



<p>At around 1,700,000km¬≤, this would make the ‚ÄúCasiquiare island‚Äù the second largest island on Earth, behind Greenland.</p>



<p>But wait, there‚Äôs more! The Casiquiare Island is by no means the only example of a bifurcation island on the planet.</p>



<p>There is one in Europe too:</p>



<h2><strong>The Hase River</strong></h2>



<p>Near the source of the Hase River in Germany, a small portion of the water flows east and becomes the Else River. Most of the Hase flows west and into the Ems, while the Else flows east and into the Weser. These rivers reach the sea around 90 km apart. This means there is a roughly 14,500 km¬≤ region of Germany that is entirely surrounded by natural rivers and the sea. This Bifurcation island is larger than Cyprus, and could be considered the 8<sup>th</sup> or 9<sup>th</sup> largest island in Europe.</p>

<p>However, to find the biggest bifurcation islands, we need to look at North America, a continent riddled with bifurcating lakes and rivers.</p>



<p>There are at least 4 places in the USA where a water system naturally splits in 2 directions and reaches the sea very far apart, and coincidentally, they all connect together. This effectively creates a vast system of connected rivers, that flow into 3 separate oceans.</p>

<h2><strong>Committee‚Äôs Punch Bowl</strong></h2>



<p>The bizarrely named ‚ÄúCommittee‚Äôs Punch Bowl‚Äù is a lake in western Canada which lies exactly on the so-called ‚ÄúGreat Divide‚Äù. This is the hydrological divide between the areas that drain west of the Rocky Mountains and into the Pacific Ocean, and the areas that drain east of the Rockies into the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans. Most lakes only have one river flowing out of them, but the Committee‚Äôs Punch Bowl is rare in that it has two. Even more unusually, these rivers flow in opposite directions and eventually into separate oceans.</p>



<p>To the west, the Woad River flows into the Kinbasket Lake, out of which flows the Columbia River, which eventually reaches the Pacific Ocean.</p>



<p>Meanwhile to the east, the Whirlpool River flows to the Athabasca River. The water passes though several other lakes and rivers before joining the Mackenzie River (the longest river in Canada), which flows into the Arctic Ocean.</p>



<p>These rivers cut off a huge area of North America, including much of western Canada and all of Alaska, totalling an area of about 3,600,000 km¬≤, larger than Greenland (the current largest-island record holder).</p>



<p>But Committee‚Äôs Punch Bowl isn‚Äôt the only bifurcation lake that drains into the Arctic via the Mackenzie River:</p>



<h2><strong>Wollaston Lake</strong></h2>



<p>Wollaston Lake in Saskatchewan, Canada, also has two outflows. To the northwest, Fond du Lac River takes 10% of the outflow to the Mackenzie River and into the Atlantic. To the northeast of the lake, the Cochrane River takes the other 90% of the water from the lake which eventually reaches the Churchill River, and finally empties into the Hudson Bay. This creates another bifurcation island north of Wollaston lake with an area of about 2 million km¬≤ .</p>



<h2><strong>Divide Creek</strong></h2>



<p>Heading back into the Rockies, not far south of Committee‚Äôs Punch Bowl and also along the Great Divide, we have a river aptly named ‚ÄúDivide Creek‚Äù. Divide Creek is a small stream that (you guessed it) divides into two separate streams: one flowing west, the other east.</p>



<p>The west branch flows in the Kicking Horse River, joins the Columbia River and then to the Pacific Ocean. The east branch flows into the Bow River, which reaches Hudson Bay via the Saskatchewan River and Nelson River. The island created by this bifurcation and the Wollaston Lake system has an area of about 790,000 km¬≤ .</p>



<p>The eastern branch of this system actually has its own bifurcation: a river called the <strong>Echimamish</strong> flows out of the Nelson River and into the Hayes River, which then winds across Manitoba for 600km before reaching the Hudson Bay very close to the Nelson River estuary.</p>



<h2>The <strong>Parting of the Waters</strong></h2>



<p>Nearly 1000km further down the Great Divide we have another river which splits in two. The river is named ‚ÄúNorth Two Ocean Creek‚Äù. In a swampy patch of Wyoming woodland, the river bifurcates into two branches, named Pacific Creek and Atlantic Creek.</p>



<p>To the west, the Pacific Creek flows into the Snake River, which is the largest tributary of the Columbia River.</p>



<p>Atlantic creek flows into the Yellowstone River, then the Missouri. The Missouri is the largest tributary of the Mississippi River, which flows into the Gulf of Mexico (part of the Atlantic Ocean).</p>



<p>The Mississippi river itself splits about 400km before reaching the sea, with 30% of the water flowing down the <strong>Atchafalaya River</strong>. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The Parting of the Waters creates the largest natural bifurcation island I can find: over 7,300,000 km¬≤. This is more than 3 times the size of Greenland (currently considered the largest island), and almost as large as Australia (the smallest continental landmass).</p>



<h2>The real largest islands in the world</h2>



<p>So, there we have it: there is a secret giant island in North America that includes more than a third the area of the USA and Canada.</p>



<p>The new, corrected list of largest islands in the world, including bifurcation islands, is as follows:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Parting of the Waters Bifurcation Island</strong>: 7,300,000 km¬≤</li>



<li><strong>Committee‚Äôs Punch Bowl Bifurcation Island: </strong>3,600,000 km¬≤</li>



<li>Greenland: 2,130,000 km¬≤</li>



<li><strong>Wollaston Lake Bifurcation Island:</strong> 2,000,000 km¬≤</li>



<li><strong>Casiquiare Bifurcation Island:</strong> 1,700,000 km¬≤</li>



<li><strong>Divide Creek Bifurcation Island:</strong> 790,000 km¬≤</li>



<li>New Guinea: 786,000 km¬≤</li>
</ol>



<p>I expect you all to correct your encyclopaedias as soon as you get a chance. Although it might be best to wait until someone can give these new islands better names. ‚ÄúCommittee‚Äôs Punch Bowl Bifurcation Island‚Äù is admittedly a bit of a mouthful.</p>



<p>Thank you for your time,</p>



<p>Starkey</p>

<h2><strong>Bonus</strong> <strong>bonus</strong>: some other bifurcations from around the world:</h2>



<ul>
<li>The Wayambo River in Suriname splits into two streams. The western one flows into the Nickerie River, and the Eastern one to the Coppename River. Both of these rivers flow into the Atlantic Ocean. They can be seen on my Casiquiare map, as a bifurcation island within a bifurcation island.</li>



<li>Isa Lake in Wyoming is only about 120km north of the Parting of the Waters, and similarly drains both west and east. However, it only does this during the spring, when meltwaters cause its eastern edge to overflow.</li>



<li>The Nerodimka in Kosovo flows into the Aegean and Black seas. I didn‚Äôt end up including it in the article because it is thought that the split was likely artificially constructed in the 14<sup>th</sup> century, but I did make a map for it if anyone is interested.</li>



<li>The Gatun Lake in Panama drains into the Atlantic and Pacific, however this is also artificial. The lake forms part of the Panama Canal.</li>



<li>Lake Okeechobee in Florida is a <em>trifurcation</em> lake, with three separate outflows. This is artificial.</li>



<li>The Danube Sinkhole is an unusual case of a vertical bifurcation: some of the water of the upper Danube River drains though the riverbed and into a system of caves. This water eventually ends up in the Rhine, which flows north into the North Sea. The rest of the Danube continues on east to the Black Sea. Since part of this system is underground, even I won‚Äôt stretch the definition of ‚Äúisland‚Äù so far as to include most of western and southern Europe. Still, interesting stuff!</li>

	<a href="https://deadline.com/tag/jeff-bezos/" id="auto-tag_jeff-bezos" data-tag="jeff-bezos">Jeff Bezos</a> is exerting more influence over the content of the <em>Washington Post</em> opinion pages, as he announced Wednesday that its editorials will now focus on ‚Äúdefense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets.‚Äù</p>



<p>
	But Bezos also made clear that alternate views will not appear on the pages.</p>








<p>
	‚ÄúWe‚Äôll cover other topics too of course, but viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others,‚Äù Bezos wrote in a memo to staffers this morning.</p>



<p>
	Bezos also wrote that David Shipley, the opinion editor, is leaving the publication.</p>



<p>
	Bezos wrote, ‚ÄúI offered David Shipley, whom I greatly admire, the opportunity to lead this new chapter. I suggested to him that if the answer wasn‚Äôt ‚Äòhell yes,‚Äô then it had to be ‚Äòno.‚Äô After careful consideration, David decided to step away. This is a significant shift, it won‚Äôt be easy, and it will require 100% commitment ‚Äî I respect his decision. We‚Äôll be searching for a new Opinion Editor to own this new direction.‚Äù

	</div>






<p>
	Bezos has owned the <em>Post </em>since 2013, and during the first Trump term, he was a consistent target of the president. As the <em>Post </em>reported critically on Trump‚Äôs administration, he threatened Bezos‚Äô Amazon with antitrust action, and the company accused his attacks on its losing out to Microsoft on a lucrative government contract.</p>



<p>
	This time around, Bezos has been praiseworthy of the president, attending his inauguration. Amazon also contributed $1 million to Trump‚Äôs inaugural fund. Before the election, Bezos also put the kibosh on editorial page plans to endorse in the presidential race, as it was likely to back Trump‚Äôs rival, Kamala Harris. </p>



<p>
	In 2023, the Biden-era Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general sued Amazon for antitrust violations. A trial is scheduled for October 2026.</p>



<p>
	Bezos‚Äô action seemed to suggest that, just as Amazon is facing the antitrust litigation, the <em>Post </em>editorial pages will be advocating for less government intervention and regulation.</p>





<p>
	Bezos wrote in his note, ‚ÄúWe are going to be writing every day in support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets. We‚Äôll cover other topics too of course, but viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others. </p>



<p>
	‚ÄúThere was a time when a newspaper, especially one that was a local monopoly, might have seen it as a service to bring to the reader‚Äôs doorstep every morning a broad-based opinion section that sought to cover all views. Today, the internet does that job.

	</p>




<p>
	‚ÄúI am of America and for America, and proud to be so. Our country did not get here by being typical. And a big part of America‚Äôs success has been freedom in the economic realm and everywhere else. Freedom is ethical ‚Äî it minimizes coercion ‚Äî and practical ‚Äî it drives creativity, invention, and prosperity.‚Äù</p>



<p>
	Bezos‚Äô announcement applies only to the opinion pages, not the news side. But it already has raised concerns in the newsroom.</p>

	Jeff Stein, chief economics reporter for the <em>Post</em>, wrote on X, ‚ÄúMassive encroachment by Jeff Bezos into <a href="https://deadline.com/tag/the-washington-post/" id="auto-tag_the-washington-post" data-tag="the-washington-post">The Washington Post</a>‚Äôs opinion section today ‚Äì makes clear dissenting views will not be published or tolerated there I still have not felt encroachment on my journalism on the news side of coverage, but if Bezos tries interfering with the news side I will be quitting immediately and letting you know.‚Äù</p>



<p>
	Bezos‚Äô action follows moves by another billionaire owner of a legacy publication, <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/10/los-angeles-times-endorsement-editorials-editor-resigns-1236156856/" data-type="post" data-id="1236156856">Patrick Soon-Shiong</a>, owns the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>. He has also sought to take more control over the publication‚Äôs opinion pages, leading to the resignation of its editorial editor as well as others.</p>



<p>
	Per <strong>The Daily Beast</strong>, former <em>Washington Post</em> executive editor Martin Baron sharply criticized Bezos‚Äô move as one to focus the opinion pages on ‚Äúthose who think exactly as he does.‚Äù</p>



<p>
	‚ÄúBezos has done personal liberties a disservice by cravenly yielding to a president who shows no respect for liberty ‚Äî one who aims to use the power of government to bully, punish and crush anyone who is not in his camp, especially the press. There is no doubt in my mind that [Bezos] is doing this out of fear of the consequences for his other business interests, Amazon (the source of his wealth) and Blue Origin (which represents his lifelong passion for space exploration). He has prioritized those commercial interests over The Post, and he is betraying The Post‚Äôs longstanding principles to do so.‚Äù</p>

ForeverVM is a code execution API that allows you to securely run arbitrary Python code in a
        remote sandbox and get back results.
</p> <p>
Unlike traditional code interpreters, ForeverVM does not have a concept of a  <em>session</em> after which state expires. Instead, ForeverVM uses memory snapshots to swap
        idle machines to disk for as long as you want. This improves scalability and resource usage,
        and means that applications and agents built on ForeverVM don't have to manage session lifecycles.
</p> <h2> How does it work? </h2> <p>
Once you have created a ForeverVM machine, you can interact with it through a REPL (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">read-eval-print loop</a>) interface. ForeverVM will assign the machine to an available worker while it is actively
        in use.
</p>  <div> <p>
When a sandbox is idle, its memory is snapshotted before it is ‚Äúdetached‚Äù from the
            worker.
</p>  </div> <div> <p>
As long as the sandbox remains inactive, it only consumes storage space, not compute or
            memory resources.
</p>  </div> <div> <p>
The next time an instruction for the sandbox is received by the API, it is assigned to a
            new worker and resumed from its last snapshot.
</p>  </div> <p>
These implementation details are hidden from the outside world. To applications built on
        ForeverVM, a machine is just a long-lived REPL that is always ready to run code.
</p> <h2> CLI </h2> <p>
The ForeverVM CLI allows you to create machines and start REPL sessions with them. It is
        distributed through major package managers. Source and binaries are also available  <a href="https://github.com/jamsocket/forevervm/releases">on GitHub</a>.
