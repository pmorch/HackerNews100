  <p>One of the most highly anticipated PC games of the year <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/cities-skylines-ii/about">Cities: Skylines 2</a> was released last week to a <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/15195/cities-skylines-2">mixed reception</a>. My impression is that gameplay and simulation-wise it seems to be a step in the right direction, and at least on paper the game seems more well-rounded in terms of features than the original was at launch. There are however significant issues with the game, ranging from balance problems and questionable design choices to <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/im-export-bug-hints-symptoms-and-causes-all-resource-management-in-the-game-is-a-deception.1604434/page-4#post-29216506">bugs</a> rendering a lot of the game’s economic simulation almost pointless. Whether or not the game is a worthy successor to the original is an open question at this point, but one thing is almost universally agreed upon: the title’s performance is not up to par.</p>
<h2 id="this-is-not-a-performance-review"><a href="#this-is-not-a-performance-review" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>(This is not) a performance review</h2>
<p>There were warning signs. Under a month before release date there was <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/cities-skylines-ii-console-release-window-faq.1600202/">an announcement</a> informing that the game’s recommended system requirements had been raised, and the console release was delayed to 2024. Quite a few YouTubers and streamers got early access to the game, but they were explicitly forbidden to talk about performance until the regular review embargo was lifted. This wasn’t exceptional as games tend to receive frequent performance optimizations and other fixes in the last few weeks before release, but it wasn’t a good sign either. Then, just a week before release Colossal Order issued <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/updates-on-modding-and-performance-for-cities-skylines-ii.1601865/">a statement</a> which I’d describe as a pre-emptive apology for the poor performance of the game. And then the game was released.</p>
<p>Simulation-heavy games like city builders can be surprisingly hard to run at a good framerate, but what makes Cities: Skylines 2 stand out is that on most systems and in most situations the game is <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/cpu-and-gpu-boundedness/">GPU-bound</a> — rather unusual for a game of this genre, as most games like this tend to be really heavy on the CPU (such as the original Cities: Skylines), but relatively light on graphics. Visually the game is an improvement on most aspects compared to the 2015 original, but nothing really justifies the game <a href="https://www.pcgameshardware.de/Cities-Skylines-2-Spiel-74219/Tests/Release-Benchmarks-Performance-Tuning-Tipps-1431613/2/">being harder to run</a> than maxed out Cyberpunk 2077 with path tracing enabled. Personally I’d even argue that C:S2 looks quite unpleasant; while individual models are relatively detailed and the sense of scale is impressive, the shading is decidedly last-gen and the screen is absolutely covered in rendering artifacts and poorly filtered textures. Comparing the game’s graphics to a relatively close competitor <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/916440/Anno_1800/">Anno 1800</a> (which was released in 2019) doesn’t do it any favours. Anno goes for a slightly more stylized look and in my humble opinion manages to look more polished and consistent, while <a href="https://www.guru3d.com/review/anno-1800-open-beta-pc-graphics-performance-benchmark-review/page-7/">offering decent performance</a> even on hardware that was considered low-to-mid range in 2019.</p>

  <figcaption>There’s a lot going on this with this character: oddly smooth hair, weirdly chunky beard, suspicious moustache, 100% opaque drug dealer sunglasses, a seam between the head and the rest of the body, and painted-on clothes.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I’m not going to waste my time meticulously benchmarking the game because many others have done that already and to a significantly higher standard than I could. If you are interested in that, check out <a href="https://www.pcgameshardware.de/Cities-Skylines-2-Spiel-74219/Tests/Release-Benchmarks-Performance-Tuning-Tipps-1431613/2/">this written article</a> from PC Games Hardware (in German) or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4DX6mUY78s">this video</a> from Gamers Nexus (in Americanese). I’ll summarize the results as such: when the settings are turned above the bare minimum (the “very low” graphics preset completely disables decadent luxuries such as shadows and fog) you need a graphics card that costs about 1000 to 2000 euros to run at the game at 60 frames per second at 1080p. As a comparison similar hardware in Alan Wake 2 — which was released the same week as C:S2 and is considered <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-alan-wake-2-optimised-settings-for-pc">by some</a> to be the best looking game of this console generation — <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/review/alan-wake-2-performance-benchmark/8.html">reaches comparable average framerates</a> with all settings cranked <em>including path tracing</em>, either at 1440p without any upscaling magic or at 4K with some help from DLSS. I think that’s a good illustration of how bizarrely demanding C:S2 is.</p>

</figure>
<p>Some personal experiences to cap off this introduction: when I started the game for the first time on my relatively beefy gaming PC (equipped with an NVidia RTX 3080 graphics card, an AMD Ryzen 7 5800X CPU and a 5120x1440 super ultrawide monitor) I was greeted by a frame rate of under 10 FPS in the main menu. After tweaking the settings <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/949230/view/3744239011016263869">as instructed by the developer</a> (which involved disabling depth of field, motion blur and volumetric effects) my FPS reached almost 90. What made this especially bizarre was that the menu features just a static background image and a few buttons. Loading into an empty map gave me about 30 to 40 FPS, and the frame rate stayed around that level after playing for about an hour, with the occasional stutter. Let’s investigate.</p>

</a>Pulling back the curtain</h2>
<p>Cities: Skylines 2 like its predecessor is made in <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a>, which means the game can be decompiled and inspected quite easily using any .NET decompiler. I used <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/decompiler/">JetBrains dotPeek</a> which has a decent Visual Studio -like UI with a large variety of search and analysis options. However static analysis doesn’t really tell us anything concrete about the rendering performance of the game. To analyze what’s going with rendering I used <a href="https://renderdoc.org/">Renderdoc</a>, an open source graphics debugger which has saved my bacon with <a href="https://blog.paavo.me/gpu-tilemap-rendering/">some of my previous GPU-y personal projects</a>.</p>
<h3 id="engine-and-architecture"><a href="#engine-and-architecture" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>Engine and architecture</h3>
<p>Let’s go through some of the technical basics of the game. Cities: Skylines 2 uses <strong>Unity 2022.3.7</strong>, which is just a few months old at the time of writing. The most notable aspect of Unity 2022 was the stabilization of the <a href="https://unity.com/dots">DOTS</a> set of technologies which Unity has been working on for several years, and interestingly C:S2 seems to be largely built on top of this stuff, including the newfangled Entity Component System (ECS) implementation and Burst compiler. I’ve been interested in <a href="https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/ecs/">the ECS architecture</a> for a few years and have experimented with implementations such as <a href="https://github.com/amethyst/specs">Specs</a>, <a href="https://github.com/amethyst/legion">Legion</a> and most recently <a href="https://bevyengine.org/">Bevy</a>, and if it weren’t for the many issues in this game I’d rather be writing about how ECS is basically the ideal architecture for a game like this. Cities: Skylines 2 seems to use DOTS to great effect as the game makes use of multiple CPU cores much more efficiently than its predecessor. Unfortunately a lot of the graphics-related issues are indirectly caused by the game’s use of DOTS. I’ll expand on that later.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://blog.paavo.me/cities-skylines-2-performance/cs2_ecs.png" alt="A screenshot from dotPeek showing different ECS-related types from the game.">
  <figcaption>Judging by the code there are about 1200 different systems powering practically all of the game logic.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The game also utilizes a bunch of third party middleware and some custom / forked libraries. Unlike DOTS, Unity’s <a href="https://unity.com/features/ui-toolkit">UI Toolkit</a> is apparently still not ready for production as C:S2 uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript based <a href="https://coherent-labs.com/products/coherent-gameface/">Coherent Gameface</a> (what a name!) for its user interfaces. A brief glance at the JS bundle reveals that they are using React and bundling using Webpack. While this is something that is guaranteed to make the average native development purist yell at clouds and complain that the darned kids should get off their lawn, I think at least on paper this will make the game’s UIs significantly easier to maintain and modify than before. Other notable bundled libraries include <a href="https://instalod.com/">InstaLOD</a>, <a href="https://odininspector.com/odin-serializer">Odin Serializer</a>, and a DLL file for NVidia DLSS 3, even though the technology is not currently supported by the game.</p>
<p>For graphics rendering the game makes use of Direct3D 11 and Unity’s <a href="https://unity.com/srp/High-Definition-Render-Pipeline">High Definition Rendering Pipeline</a>, also known as HDRP. Unity’s regular rendering system only works with traditional <code>MonoBehaviour</code>-based game objects, so a game built using DOTS &amp; ECS needs something to bridge the gap. Unity has a package called <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.entities.graphics@1.1/manual/index.html">Entities Graphics</a>, but surprisingly Cities: Skylines 2 doesn’t seem to use that. The reason might be its relative immaturity and its limited set of supported rendering features; according to the <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.entities.graphics@1.1/manual/entities-graphics-versions.html">feature matrix</a> both skinning (used for animated models like characters) and occlusion culling (not rendering things that are behind other things) are marked as experimental, and virtual texturing (making GPU texture handling more complex but hopefully more efficient) is not supported at all. Instead it seems that Colossal Order decided to implement the glue between the ECS and the renderer by themselves, utilizing <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Rendering.BatchRendererGroup.html"><code>BatchRendererGroup</code></a> and a lot of relatively low level code. I’ll cover this and its many implications in more detail later.</p>
<h3 id="attachment-issues"><a href="#attachment-issues" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>Attachment issues</h3>
<p>Getting Renderdoc attached to a process and collecting rendering events is usually quite trivial. Normally you just need to provide Renderdoc the path of the executable, the working directory and some command line arguments, and then Renderdoc starts the binary and injects itself to the game process. However, my issue was that I had the game on Xbox Game Pass, which does some weird sandboxing and / or NTFS ownership magic to limit what you can do with the game files. Renderdoc was not allowed to read the game’s executable, even when running as administrator. Before I knew Game Pass was the problem I also tried to use <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-graphics">NVidia Nsight Graphics</a>™️ instead (a tool similar to Renderdoc from NVidia), but it had the same issue. Ultimately I ended up solving that particular problem with my credit card: I bought the game again on Steam at full price, despite knowing it had severe issues. Sorry.</p>
<p>However, the Steam version didn’t immediately start co-operating either. This time the problem was Paradox Launcher, a little piece of bloatware used in most big budget Paradox-published titles. The launcher binary is also included in the Game Pass version, but at least on release it seemed to be completely unused. Basically when you start C:S2 from Steam it pops up Paradox Launcher, you click either Resume or Play, and then it actually runs the game binary. I tried to attach Renderdoc by running <code>Cities2.exe</code> directly but that didn’t work — it creates the game window, but then runs for a few seconds, opens the launcher and then exits. There is an option in Renderdoc called “Capture child processes” which should in theory make Renderdoc inject itself to all processes started by the target process — so it should attach itself to the launcher started by the game binary, and then get injected to the game binary again — but I think there was some extra layer of indirection which unfortunately prevented that from working. I configured Renderdoc to start Paradox Launcher directly, but in short that didn’t work either, as Steam and the launcher do some communication to select which game to start and to handle authentication / DRM thingies. Some of that communication happens through command line arguments which I was able to extract using <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer">Process Explorer</a>, but reusing the same arguments didn’t work either, so I gave up on that approach as well.</p>
<p>Ultimately I was able to finally attach Renderdoc by using the <a href="https://renderdoc.org/docs/window/capture_attach.html#global-process-hook">Global Process Hook</a> option, which the program hides by default and advices against using. It is a very invasive method of hooking as it injects a DLL to every single process that is started on the system, but hey, it worked! We can finally see what’s going on.</p>

</figure>
<p>I was later able to get NVidia Nsight Graphics™️ working as well. Instead of trying to start the game or the launcher, I opened Steam from Nsight and then started the game from Steam’s UI as usual. Ultimately I wasn’t able to get much more information out of Nsight than I already had from Renderdoc, as it seems that many of NSight’s profiling and performance focused features are not supported with D3D11.</p>

</a>Renderdoc analysis</h2>
<p>I’ll preface this section by admitting that I’m not a professional graphics programmer nor even a particularly proficient hobbyist. I do graphics programming occasionally and have spent quite a lot of time toying with game engines, but I’m not an expert on either subject. I have never implemented Actual Proper Graphics Things like deferred rendering or cascaded shadow mapping, though I think I know how they should work in theory. So as difficult it might be to believe, there is a chance that I’m wrong about some of the things I’m about to say. If you think I’m wrong, please let me know!</p>
<p>Let’s begin by analyzing the following frame (click to open it as a new tab):</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.paavo.me/cities-skylines-2-performance/cs2_night.jpg" alt="A screenshot from Cities: Skylines 2 at night"></p>
<p>This is a decently complex frame, but it’s far from the scale the game can actually reach. This was captured in a town of about 1000 inhabitants under an hour into a new save. There’s rain and it’s night time, but in my experience neither moves the needle much in terms of performance. The game version was <code>1.0.11f1</code>, so the first post-release hotfix is included. It should be noted that latest patch at the time of publication (<code>1.0.12f1</code>) was released during the making of this article and it includes some improvements for the issues I’m about to describe, but it’s far from having solved all of them.</p>
<p>Renderdoc reports that the frame took about 87.8 milliseconds to render, which would average to about 11.4 FPS. The game was running at 30-40 FPS on average at the time, so either this frame is an outlier (which — as we’ve learned <a href="https://youtu.be/l4DX6mUY78s?t=546">from the Gamers Nexus video</a> — is ironically quite common) or perhaps more likely Renderdoc adds a bit of overhead in a way that affects the measurements, as all of the frames I’ve captured have reported slightly higher frame times than what I’ve seen in-game when playing normally. I’m making the assumption that even if Renderdoc does add some overhead, it adds it in a way that doesn’t completely invalidate the measurements, like making specific API calls take 10x longer than they normally would.</p>
<p>For reference, at consistent 60 FPS the frametime should always be about <code>1000 / 60 = 16.666...</code> milliseconds.</p>
<p>Here are some basic rendering statistics reported by Renderdoc:</p>

<p>There’s not much we can deduce from these figures alone. 6705 draw calls and over 50000 API calls both sound like a lot, but without further context their cost is hard to evaluate. 6.7 gigabytes of used video memory is a lot for a relatively simple scene like this, especially considering there are still current generation mid-tier graphics cards with only 8 gigabytes of VRAM.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.paavo.me/cities-skylines-2-performance/renderdoc_events.png" alt="A screenshot from Renderdoc, showing API calls grouped by rendering pass."></p>
<p>Since the game uses HDRP <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@17.0/manual/rendering-excecution-order.html">its documentation</a> might serve as a good starting point for understanding the different rendering and compute passes the game perform on each frame. I’m not going to do a fancy graphics study like these legendary ones for <a href="http://www.adriancourreges.com/blog/2016/09/09/doom-2016-graphics-study/">DOOM 2016</a> and <a href="http://www.adriancourreges.com/blog/2015/11/02/gta-v-graphics-study/">GTA V</a>, but I’ll go through most of the rendering process step by step and highlight some of the more interesting things along the way.</p>
<h3 id="dots-instance-data-update"><a href="#dots-instance-data-update" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>DOTS instance data update</h3>
<p>Almost every draw call the game makes uses <a href="https://learnopengl.com/Advanced-OpenGL/Instancing">instancing</a>, which is required in a game of this scale. To make instancing work the game has a single large buffer of instance data which contains everything necessary for rendering any and all objects. The contents and size of per-instance data varies by the type of entity but it seems that regular game objects like buildings take about 50 floats per instance, roads significantly more. I haven’t fully figured out how the buffer is managed because it’s a very complex system, but essentially the instance data for every visible object is updated to the buffer each frame, and the changes are then uploaded to the GPU. The buffer starts at about 60 megabytes, and is reallocated to a larger size when necessary.</p>
<p>The buffer is used for practically every draw call the game makes, and according to Renderdoc it’s at least available in every vertex and pixel shader, though I would assume it’s primarily only used in vertex shaders. It would be interesting to know how this buffer affects GPU’s cache as I would assume instances are not laid out in the buffer in the same order they are rendered and that could be a problem for caching, but I lack the expertise to figure that out. Regardless there is a certain cost associated with looking up data from this buffer for every vertex, and it might explain some of the issues regarding high poly meshes I’ll get to soon.</p>
<h3 id="simulation"><a href="#simulation" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>Simulation</h3>
<p>Several compute shaders are used for graphics-related simulations, such as water, snow and particles, as well as skeletal animation. These take about 1.5 milliseconds in total, which is under 2% of frame time.</p>
<p>One early theory regarding the game’s poor performance was that maybe it was offloading a lot of the actual game simulation to the GPU, saving CPU time but taking processing power away from rendering. However, I can conclude based on both decompiled code and GPU calls that this is simply not the case.</p>
<h3 id="virtual-texturing-cache-update"><a href="#virtual-texturing-cache-update" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>Virtual texturing cache update</h3>
<p>Remember how I mentioned that virtual texturing is not supported by Entities Graphics? Well, it seems that C:S2 implements its own virtual texturing / texture streaming system. I first assumed that the game is using <a href="https://unity.com/products/granite-sdk">Unity’s built-in solution</a> for that, but in traditional Unity fashion even though it was added to the engine in 2020 following an acquisition it remains as <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/svt-streaming-virtual-texturing.html">experimental and unsupported</a> as ever (<a href="https://forum.unity.com/threads/feedback-wanted-streaming-virtual-texturing.849133/page-5#post-8371560">if not more so</a>).</p>
<p>What is virtual texturing, anyway? My understanding is that virtual texturing is an approach for loading and managing texture data in a potentially more memory efficient way than the méthode traditionnelle of using one GPU texture per texture asset. Textures are stored in texture atlases, which are basically fancier versions of sprite sheets (which I also happened to cover in my <a href="https://blog.paavo.me/gpu-tilemap-rendering/#shader-method-summarised-with-more-words-and-less-detail-than-the-original-article">GPU tile mapping article</a>). Atlases consist of tiles of a fixed size, and each tile can contain one or more textures. The trick which can save memory is that large textures can be split into multiple tiles, so if you have a large texture that is only visible in a small portion of the screen, you only need to load the tiles that are actually visible. Virtual texture visibility information is produced as a side product of normal rendering in a later pass, and the visibility information is used on the CPU side to determine which tiles need to be loaded and which can be unloaded. If you want to know more, <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.3/en-US/streaming-virtual-texturing-in-unreal-engine/">Unreal Engine’s documentation</a> seems to offer a great description of the technique in more detail. The game seems to use virtual texturing for all static 3D objects except the terrain.</p>
<figure>

  <figcaption>One of the tile atlases used in the rendering of my example frame. Massively downscaled; the original is 16368x8448.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This approach to texturing is quite elegant in theory but it comes with many tradeoffs, and the game’s implementation still has some teething issues, such as high resolution textures sometimes failing to load even when the surface is close to the camera. The use of virtual texturing is also likely the culprit for the game’s lack of support for <a href="https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Glossary:Anisotropic_filtering_(AF)">anisotropic texture filtering</a>, a standard feature in PC games since the beginning of the millennium.</p>
<p>The pass took about 0.5 milliseconds.</p>
<h3 id="skybox-generation"><a href="#skybox-generation" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>Skybox generation</h3>
<p>The game uses Unity HDRP’s <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@17.0/manual/create-a-physically-based-sky.html">built-in sky system</a>, so it generates a skybox texture (a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube_mapping">cubemap</a>) every frame. This takes about 0.65 milliseconds which is not a lot compared to everything else, but if the game was targeting 60 FPS it would be almost 4% of the total frame time budget.</p>
<h3 id="pre-pass"><a href="#pre-pass" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>Pre-pass</h3>
<p><img src="https://blog.paavo.me/cities-skylines-2-performance/cs2_prepass.jpg" alt="A screenshot from Renderdoc, showing the normal/roughness buffer of my example frame."></p>
<p>Now we get to the actual rendering. C:S2 uses <a href="https://learnopengl.com/Advanced-Lighting/Deferred-Shading">deferred rendering</a>, which basically means that rendering is done in many phases and using several different intermediate render targets. The first phase is the pre-pass, which produces per-pixel depth, normal and (presumably) smoothness information into two separate textures.</p>
<p>This pass is surprisingly heavy as it takes about 8.2 milliseconds, or roughly about far too long, and this is where some of the biggest issues with the game’s rendering start to appear. But first we need to talk about <strong>THE TEETH</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="the-teeth-controversy"><a href="#the-teeth-controversy" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>The teeth controversy</h3>
<p><img src="https://blog.paavo.me/cities-skylines-2-performance/cs2_mouth.png" alt="A screenshot from Renderdoc, showing a simply shaded mesh of a character’s mouth."></p>
<p>One bizarre yet popular talking point about Cities: Skylines 2’s performance is the fact that the character models have fully modelled teeth, even though there’s literally no way to see them in-game, unless we count using the photo mode and clipping the camera inside a character’s head. Reddit user Hexcoder0 did some digging using NVidia Nsight Graphics™️ and posted their findings in to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines/comments/17gfq13/the_game_does_render_individual_teeth_with_no_lod/">a thread</a> in the official subreddit (which inspired me to do my own research and write this pointlessly long article). It was revealed that not only does the game have fully modelled teeth, they are rendered <em>literally all the time</em> at maximum quality. More importantly this is the case for everything related to characters: none of the character meshes have any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_detail_(computer_graphics)">LOD</a> variants. Colossal Order <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/cities-skyline-2-dev-says-yes-our-characters-have-teeth-no-the-characters-teeth-are-not-affecting-performance/">was quick</a> to acknowledge this publicly, and they even referenced broader problems with LOD handling. Ignore all the weird rambling about simulating citizens’s teeth and whatnot; this is not <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/how-cats-get-drunk-in-dwarf-fortress-and-why-its-creators-havent-figured-out-time-travel-yet/">Dwarf Fortress</a> so they are not doing that, and even if they were that obviously wouldn’t require rendering the teeth.</p>
<p>Colossal Order has also <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/behind-the-scenes-5-citizen-characters.1602554/">told us that</a> that they are using a middleware called <a href="https://www.didimo.co/">Didimo Popul8</a> to generate the character models. If I recall correctly the teeth controversy began even before the game was released when someone noticed that the Didimo <a href="https://developer.didimo.co/docs/mesh">character specification</a> includes separate meshes for things like teeth and eyelashes. I had originally assumed that the game is using Didimo’s default character meshes — because to be honest they look very generic and soulless — but now I’m not so sure. The meshes in the game in fact have even more polygons than Didimo’s defaults: the infamous mouth / teeth model for example consists of 6108 vertices, significantly more than the default mesh’s 1060. A single character <em>even before we add hair, clothing and accessories</em> is about 56 thousand vertices, which is a lot. For context the average low-density residential building uses less than 10 thousand vertices before yard props and other details are added.</p>
<p>In this example frame the game renders 13 sets of teeth, and their visual impact on the frame is zero: not a single pixel is affected. Even the characters themselves contribute basically nothing to the frame except for noise and artifacts.</p>

</a>Pre-pass continued, featuring the high poly hall of shame</h3>
<p>The egregiously unoptimized character models are not the sole cause of the game’s poor performance (because it’s never that easy), but they are an indicator of the broader issues with the game’s assets and rendering. The game regularly draws too many objects with too many polygons that have quite literally zero impact on the final image. This is not specific to the pre-pass, as the same issues seem to affect all rendering passes which rasterize geometry. I think there are two main causes for this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Some models don’t have any LOD variants at all.</li>
<li>The game’s culling system is not very advanced; the custom rendering code only implements frustum culling and there’s no sign of occlusion culling at all. There is some culling based on distance but it’s not very aggressive, which is great for avoiding pop-in but bad for performance.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here are a few other examples besides the character models.</p>

    <figcaption>This parking booth mesh is technically not used in my example frame’s pre-pass, but it is still present in the scene and later used in the shadow mapping pass. This mesh consists of over 40K vertices with no LODs, and features luxurious details you don’t even get in most AAA games, like individually modelled cables connecting screens and keyboards. They are even routed through a (relatively round) hole in the desk! Combining the building and the furniture into one mesh saves on draw calls, but it also means that the props can’t be culled individually.</figcaption>

</figure>
<p>Now you might say that these are just cherry-picked examples, and that modern hardware handles models like these just fine. And you would be broadly correct in that, but the problem is that all of these relatively small costs start to add up, especially in a city builder where one unoptimized model might get rendered a few hundred times in a single frame. Rasterizing tens of thousands of polygons per instance per frame and literally not affecting a single pixel is just wasteful, whether or not the hardware can handle it. The issues are luckily quite easy to fix, both by creating more LOD variants and by improving the culling system. It will take some time though, and it remains to be seen if CO and Paradox want to invest that time, especially if it involves going through most of the game’s assets and fixing them one by one.</p>
<p>To be clear having highly detailed models is not a problem in itself, especially if you are intending to make a self-proclaimed next generation city builder. The problem is that the game is struggling to handle this level of detail, and that polygons are used inefficiently and inconsistently. For every character model with opulently modelled nostril hairs there are common props with surprisingly low polycounts. I think if the game ran well people would be celebrating these highly detailed models and making hyperbolic social media posts and clickbait videos titled “OMG the devs thought of EVERYTHING 🤯🤯🤯” and “I can’t believe they modelled the cables in the parking booth 😱😱😱” and “CITY SKYLINES 2 MOST DETAILED GAME EVER CONFIRMED?”. Instead we are here.</p>
<p>Oh yeah I was talking about rendering at some point, wasn’t I? Let’s continue.</p>
<h3 id="motion-vectors"><a href="#motion-vectors" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>Motion vectors</h3>
<p>The game renders per-pixel motion vectors as a separate pass, which can be used for anti-aliasing and motion blur. I think motion vectors are slightly broken now, which is also the reason the game doesn’t support DLSS or FSR2 at the time of writing. There is a temporal anti-aliasing option hidden in the advanced settings menu and it improves the rendering quality to some extent, but things animated using vertex shaders like trees are just covered in artifacts and ghosting.</p>
<p>This pass takes about 0.6 milliseconds.</p>
<h3 id="roads-and-decals"><a href="#roads-and-decals" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>Roads and decals</h3>
<p><img src="https://blog.paavo.me/cities-skylines-2-performance/cs2_lawn.jpg" alt="The decal buffer of my example frame."></p>
<p><img src="https://blog.paavo.me/cities-skylines-2-performance/cs2_lawn_closeup.png" alt="A closeup of the decal buffer."></p>
<p>Now we are finally rendering something recognizable: roads! And lawns, and other things that follow the surface of the terrain.</p>
<p>This pass takes about 1 millisecond.</p>
<h3 id="main-pass"><a href="#main-pass" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>Main pass</h3>
<p><img src="https://blog.paavo.me/cities-skylines-2-performance/cs2_main_pass.jpg" alt="The albedo buffer of the main pass."></p>
<p><img src="https://blog.paavo.me/cities-skylines-2-performance/cs2_main_pass_closeup.png" alt="A closeup of the albedo buffer."></p>
<p><img src="https://blog.paavo.me/cities-skylines-2-performance/cs2_main_pass_normal.jpg" alt="The normal buffer of the main pass."></p>
<p>This is the meat (vegan alternatives are available) of the deferred rendering process. This pass takes in all the intermediate render targets produced so far alongside the virtual texture caches and some seemingly hardcoded textures and produces several more buffers, including ones for albedo, normals, different PBR properties and depth. It also produces the virtual texture visibility information I mentioned earlier. It is rendered at half horizontal resolution, presumably as an optimization. Terrain doesn’t use virtual texturing, so it is rendered at full resolution and with a constant color regardless of the actual terrain texture.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.paavo.me/cities-skylines-2-performance/cs2_vt_feedback.png" alt="The virtual texture visibility buffer."></p>
<p>This pass takes 16.7 milliseconds, or about as long the entire frame should take if we were aiming for 60 frames per second. The pass rasterizes all of the geometry again, so the same reasons for the pre-pass being slow apply here as well. The additional cost is probably explained by the number of additional outputs, plus the cost of virtual texture cache lookups and texture mapping itself.</p>
<h3 id="ambient-occlusion"><a href="#ambient-occlusion" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>Ambient occlusion</h3>
<p>Next the game produces an ambient occlusion buffer using motion vectors, normals and the depth buffer plus copies of the last two from the previous frame. Judging by the debug names of the shaders the algorithm is <a href="https://www.activision.com/cdn/research/Practical_Real_Time_Strategies_for_Accurate_Indirect_Occlusion_NEW%20VERSION_COLOR.pdf">GTAO</a>. This takes about 1.6 milliseconds.</p>
<h3 id="cascaded-shadow-mapping"><a href="#cascaded-shadow-mapping" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>Cascaded shadow mapping</h3>
<p><img src="https://blog.paavo.me/cities-skylines-2-performance/cs2_shadowmap.jpg" alt="The shadow map buffer."></p>
<p>C:S2 uses <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dxtecharts/cascaded-shadow-maps">cascaded shadow mapping</a>, and in my opinion not very well. Shadows are full of artifacts and constantly flickering especially when either the sun or any foliage are moving (and they are, all of the time). Even when the screen isn’t completely covered with artifacts, the resolution of the shadows is quite low, and the jump in quality between the different shadow cascades is very noticeable.</p>
<p>The game uses four cascades with a resolution of 2048x2048 pixels per cascade. There’s a directional shadow map resolution setting in the advanced graphics settings menu, but at the time of writing it’s not connected to anything in the code; neither the individual setting nor the overall shadow quality setting alters the resolution of the shadow map. This is the reason why the medium and the high shadow setting presets are literally identical. I don’t know whether this is an oversight or if the setting was hastily disabled because it was causing issues. The low preset differs from medium and high in that it disables shadows cast by the terrain.</p>
<p>Despite the low quality, it is by far the slowest rendering pass, taking about 40 milliseconds or almost half of total frametime. It also dwarfs all other passes in terms of the number of draw calls: in my test frame 4828 out of 6705 draw calls were for shadow mapping, a staggering 72%. This is why there’s such a huge performance gain when shadows are disabled.</p>
<p>The reasons behind this pass’s slowness are mostly the same as with the pre-pass and the main pass: too much unnecessary geometry rendered with way too many draw calls. Renderdoc’s performance counters view indicates that many of the draw calls affect between zero and under 100 pixels in the shadow map, and the teeth are back again. The game seems to treat every single 3D object as a potential shadow caster on all quality settings regardless of size or distance. There’s a lot of room for optimization here, and in theory general improvements to LODs and culling should have a large impact on shadow mapping performance as well. Hopefully after performance has been improved CO (or modders) can turn the shadow quality setting back up, and raise the shadow map resolution to something more 2023.</p>
<p>Let’s end this part on a positive side note: when digging into shadow handling code I stumbled upon the fact that the game computes the positions of the sun and the moon using the current date, time and coordinates of the city. That’s a really neat detail!</p>
<h3 id="screen-space-reflections-and-global-illumination"><a href="#screen-space-reflections-and-global-illumination" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">

<p><img src="https://blog.paavo.me/cities-skylines-2-performance/cs2_gi_buffer.jpg" alt="The screen space global illumination buffer."></p>
<p>The game uses Unity HDRP’s built-in implementations of <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@17.0/manual/Override-Screen-Space-Reflection.html">screen space reflections</a> (SSR) and <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@17.0/manual/Override-Screen-Space-GI.html">screen space global illumination</a> (SSGI). I won’t be covering them in detail because Unity’s documentation is already decently comprehensive, plus I’m not going to pretend I fully understand them. Global illumination uses ray-marching and is evaluated by default at half resolution. Denoising and temporal accumulation are used to improve the quality. It would be nice if the game as a self-proclaimed next generation city builder supported hardware accelerated ray tracing in addition to these screen space solutions, but I’m not holding my breath.</p>
<p>These two effects combined took about 3 milliseconds.</p>
<h3 id="deferred-lighting"><a href="#deferred-lighting" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>Deferred lighting</h3>
<p><img src="https://blog.paavo.me/cities-skylines-2-performance/cs2_lit.jpg" alt="The results of deferred lighting"></p>
<p>This is where it all comes together. Most of the intermediate buffers produced so far are combined to render the near-final image. Not much more to say about this pass, except that it takes about 2.1 milliseconds.</p>
<h3 id="weird-clothing-pass"><a href="#weird-clothing-pass" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>Weird clothing pass</h3>
<p>There’s a small rendering pass just for the clothes of the Didimo characters, in this case 3 dresses, 1 jumpsuit and 1 set of suit trousers. The remaining 8 characters are either naked or their clothes use different shaders. This pass affects almost no pixels at this zoom level. Luckily it takes just 0.2 milliseconds.</p>
<h3 id="sky-rendering"><a href="#sky-rendering" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>Sky rendering</h3>
<p>The sky is rendered next using the previously generated skybox texture, though it is not visible in my example frame. This pass takes about 0.3 milliseconds.</p>
<h3 id="transparent-objects-pre-pass"><a href="#transparent-objects-pre-pass" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>Transparent objects pre-pass</h3>
<p>Traditional deferred rendering doesn’t work with transparent objects, so they are rendered separately. Transparent objects are rendered in two phases, starting with this pre-pass which only updates the normal and depth buffers. There are not many unique transparent objects in the frame, so this pass takes about 0.12 milliseconds.</p>
<h3 id="water-rendering"><a href="#water-rendering" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>Water rendering</h3>
<p>The game does some pre-processing in compute shaders to prepare for water rendering and then produces several downscaled and blurred versions of the almost-final image. These inputs are fed to the main water rendering shader which renders the water surface. This takes about 1 millisecond.</p>
<h3 id="particles-rain-and-transparent-objects"><a href="#particles-rain-and-transparent-objects" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>Particles, rain and transparent objects</h3>
<p>This pass handles most things transparent, including particles, weather effects and 3D objects made of glass and other transparent materials. No particles are visible in the frame, but the game still tries to render the smoke from the industrial zone’s chimneys, as well as the stream of goop produced by the sewage pipe. Rain is rendered next, using 20 instances of 12K vertices each. Interestingly the remaining transparent objects are rendered after the rain, causing some weirdness when transparent objects (like greenhouses and power lines) and rain overlap. All of this takes about 0.56 milliseconds.</p>
<h3 id="vt-feedback-processing"><a href="#vt-feedback-processing" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>VT feedback processing</h3>
<p><img src="https://blog.paavo.me/cities-skylines-2-performance/cs2_vt_feedback_2.png" alt="The virtual texture feedback buffer."></p>
<p>The virtual texture visibility buffer we got earlier is processed with a compute shader, resulting in an output texture 1/16th of the original resolution. For the visualization I nearest neighbor scaled the output 8x to make it more readable. This is the information the game ultimately gets back from the GPU to decide which texture tiles to load and unload. Renderdoc reported very little time spent on this, well under 0.1 milliseconds.</p>
<h3 id="bunch-of-post-processing"><a href="#bunch-of-post-processing" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>Bunch of post-processing</h3>
<p>The game uses many of Unity’s built-in post-processing effects, including temporal AA (which is a bit broken as I previously mentioned), bloom and tonemapping, plus DOF and motion blur if enabled. I can’t be bothered to sum up the timings of all of these, but it’s about 1 to 2 milliseconds in total.</p>

<p>The last remaining draw calls are used to render all of the different UI elements, both the ones that are drawn into the world as well as the more traditional UI elements like the bottom bar and other controls. Quite a lot of draw calls are used for the Gameface-powered UI elements, though ultimately these calls are very fast compared to the rest of the rendering process. The names of roads are rendered into the scene using 2D <a href="https://libgdx.com/wiki/graphics/2d/fonts/distance-field-fonts">signed distance fields</a>. The depth buffer is used to blend the text with the scene if the text is behind a building or other object, which is a nice touch. This final pass takes an irrelevant amount of time.</p>

<p>I tried not to make this into an in-depth graphics study, but I think I failed. Hope you learned something new.</p>
<h2 id="summary-and-conclusions"><a href="#summary-and-conclusions" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>Summary and conclusions</h2>
<p>So why is Cities: Skylines 2 so incredibly heavy on the GPU? The short answer is that the game is throwing so much unnecessary geometry at the graphics card that the game manages to be largely limited by the available rasterization performance. The cause for unnecessary geometry is both the lack of simplified LOD variants for many of the game’s meshes, as well as the simplistic and seemingly untuned culling implementation. And the reason why the game has its own culling implementation instead of using Unity’s built in solution (which should at least in theory be much more advanced) is because Colossal Order had to implement quite a lot of the graphics side themselves because Unity’s integration between DOTS and HDRP is still very much a work in progress and arguably unsuitable for most actual games. Similarly Unity’s virtual texturing solution remains eternally in beta, so CO had to implement their own solution for that too, which still has some teething issues.</p>
<p>Here’s what I think that happened (a.k.a this is speculation): Colossal Order took a gamble on Unity’s new and shiny tech, and in some ways it paid off massively and in others it caused them a lot of headache. This is not a rare situation in software development and is something I’ve experienced myself as well in my dayjob as a web-leaning developer. They chose DOTS as the architecture to fix the CPU bottlenecks their previous game suffered from and to increase the scale &amp; depth of the simulation, and largely succeeded on that front. CO started the game when DOTS was still experimental, and it probably came as a surprise how much they had to implement themselves even when DOTS was officially considered production ready. I wouldn’t be surprised if they started the game with Entities Graphics but then had to pivot to custom solutions for culling, skeletal animation, texture streaming and so on when they realized Unity’s official solution was not going to cut it. Ultimately the game had to be released too early when these systems were still unpolished, likely due to financial and / or publisher pressure. None of these technical issues were news for the developers on release day, and I don’t believe their claim that the game was intended to target 30 FPS from the beginning — no purebred PC game has done that since the early 2000s, and the graphical fidelity doesn’t justify it.</p>
<p>While I did find a lot to complain about the game’s technology, this little investigation which has been consuming a large share of my free time for the past 1.5 weeks has also made me appreciate the game’s lofty goals and sympathize more with the developers of this technically ambitious yet troubled game. I’ve learned a lot about how Cities: Skylines 2 &amp; Unity HDRP work under the hood, and I’ve also gotten some good practice with Renderdoc.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mosquitoes infected with Wolbachia bacteria may be associated with a 97% drop in <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/tropical-diseases/a-60816035">dengue infections</a> in three cities in Colombia's Aburra Valley.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Researchers for the non-profit World Mosquito Program released the results at the annual meeting of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene in late October.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The World Mosquito Program is looking to <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/scientists-weaponize-mosquitoes-in-fight-against-dengue-fever/a-45152945">stop the spread</a> of a number of life-threatening vector-borne diseases — among them dengue, <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/dengue-and-zika-virus-can-make-you-smell-tastier-to-mosquitoes/a-62382119">Zika virus</a> and yellow fever — by dispersing millions of Wolbachia bacteria-infected mosquitoes in places where these diseases are common.&nbsp;</p>

<figure><img data-format="MASTER_LANDSCAPE" data-id="66791415" data-url="https://static.dw.com/image/66791415_${formatId}.jpg" data-aspect-ratio="16/9" alt="Bangladesch Dengue-Fieber Ausbruch" src="https://static.dw.com/image/66791415_$%7BformatId%7D.jpg"><figcaption>Dengue fever outbreaks come in waves<small>Image: Mortuza Rashed/DW</small></figcaption></figure>

<h2>How does the Wolbachia bacteria prevent dengue?</h2>

<p>The Wolbachia bacteria significantly reduces <em>Aedes aegypti</em> mosquitoes' ability to spread disease.</p>

<p><em>Aedes aegypti</em> is one of the most notorious spreaders of harmful vector-borne diseases.</p>

<p>After a 2015 pilot release in the Colombian city of Bello, the researchers expanded their operations to the nearby cities of Medellíin and Itagua. Although researchers have conducted experiments like this across the world, these releases marked the program's largest yet.</p>

<p>By April 2022, they found that around 80% of all mosquitoes in Bello and Itagui had been infected by the Wolbachia mosquitoes (through cross-breeding), and around 60% in Medellíin.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To see whether this infiltration had actually impacted <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/dengue-fever-the-small-but-lethal-mosquito-bite/a-50006727">dengue levels</a> in the three cities, the researchers evaluated the number of cases reported over the course of the releases until July 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They found that the introduction of the infected mosquitoes into local mosquito populations was "associated with a significant reduction"&nbsp;in dengue of up to 97% in each city compared to ten years prior to the start of the experiment.</p>

<p>They also conducted a case control study in Medellín. There, they said they found a causal association between the deployment of the infected mosquitoes and reduced cases of dengue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The researchers said results showed a 47% drop in dengue in neighborhoods where the mosquitoes had been released.</p>

<p>They added that this was the largest contiguous implementation of these infected mosquito releases. The positive results "highlight the operational feasibility and real-world effectiveness of … deployment in large urban settings, and the reproducibility of the public health benefit across different ecological settings."</p>

<h2>One and done?</h2>

<p>Although the Colombia releases mark the largest yet conducted, World Mosquito Program researchers have been facilitating similar experiments around the world. Earlier studies found that in Yogyakarta in Indonesia, for example, dengue cases were reduced through the program's method by 77%, while in Brazil, the disease burden was reduced by 38% (so far).</p>

<p>Scientists are currently testing <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/genetically-modified-mosquitoes-breed-in-brazil/a-50414340">many ways</a> to eliminate vector-borne diseases like dengue. Experts say the "one-and-done"&nbsp;nature of the World Mosquito Program's method is a plus.</p>

<p>"Once you introduce the Wolbachia mosquitoes into the native mosquito populations, they stay there. You don't have to release more mosquitoes," Biologist Rafael Maciel de Freitas, who works at the Brazilian Oswaldo Cruz Foundation and the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine, told DW in April 2023.</p>

<p>However, Freitas told DW, there is concern the method won't work forever, given the high possibility the dengue pathogen will find a way to adapt to — and circumvent — the Wolbachia bacteria. "The virus will probably find a way to overcome the Wolbachia effect," Freitas said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I wouldn't say the Wolbachia method is the solution to dengue, but I think we have a better answer to the disease this way," Freitas added.</p>

<h2>More work to be done</h2>

<p>Sounds like good news, and it could be. There are some caveats, however: one is that the World Mosquito Program's methods are expensive to implement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And at this point, it is still unclear whether the dengue declines detected in Colombia and elsewhere can be attributed solely to the Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes. <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/dengue-a-closer-look-at-a-spreading-fever/a-18951298">Dengue comes in waves</a> — sometimes a city in a dengue-prone area will go years without seeing an outbreak.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally, there are certain areas where the Wolbachia-infected <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/the-mosquito-the-worlds-smallest-biggest-killer/a-19017493">mosquitoes</a> don't seem to cause a decline in dengue cases, or cause a much smaller decline than in other areas. Scientists still aren't sure what makes some areas appear resistant to the approach and others not.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The World Mosquito Program is looking to scale up operations in the coming decade — it announced plans earlier this year to build a factory in Brazil that would infect some 5 billion mosquitoes with Wolbachia annually.</p>

<h2>Keep Feathered Friends Safe</h2>
<p>While the kitchen may be the heart of the home, it’s not necessarily the best place for your feathered friends to live. Cooking fumes, smoke, and odors that have little-to-no effect on people can quickly sicken and even kill some birds—and it can happen very quickly.</p>
<p>Unattended cookware that overheats—or cookware that’s heated up without anything added to the pan—can release fumes that are toxic to birds. To keep them safe:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Keep them out of the kitchen when you’re cooking.</li>
    <li>Don’t leave heated cookware unattended.</li>
    <li>Don’t preheat cookware on high heat settings.</li>
    <li>Always open a window or turn on the exhaust fan for ventilation when you’re cooking.</li>
</ul>

<div>
<h2 id="_introduction"><a href="#_introduction"></a><a href="#_introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<div>
<p>This talk is a case study of designing an efficient Go package.
I’m going to use the example of building a high performance JSON parser.</p>
<p>The goals of this project were:</p>
<div>
<dl>
<dt>Supports streaming operations</dt>
<dd>
<p>It’s unrealistic to expect to have the entire input in memory.
Buffering in memory is a availability risk, input sizes are usually unknown and potentially unbounded.
Buffering before processing introduces latency.
Streaming reads lets you process data as it arrives and overlap that processing with reading.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Reasonably compatible with the <code>encoding/json</code> package</dt>
<dd>
<p>This package offers the same high level <code>json.Decoder</code> API but higher throughput and reduced allocations.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Allocation free, or bounded API</dt>
<dd>
<p>In addition to the <code>encoding/json</code> API, provide an alternative, more efficient API.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_time_complexity"><a href="#_time_complexity"></a><a href="#_time_complexity">Time complexity</a></h2>
<div>
<p>Let’s talk about the time complexity of this problem.</p>
<p>JSON doesn’t use length markers; to know how much to read, we have to read it all.
To parse the 1,000th element in JSON array, we have to read and process the 999 that come before it.
This means the lower bounds on the time to process the input is the size of the input — you can’t skip ahead.</p>
<p>But reading isn’t the full story, we need to process it through the JSON state machine to figure out where the tokens start and end.
Thus the performance is at least <code>read(N)+parse(N)</code>.</p>
<p>But there are other costs:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ideally if we read N bytes, we want to process each byte only once.
If we touch the same byte more than once, that adds overhead, and complicates processing if we have to keep those bytes around to come back and look at them again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just like we don’t want to process a byte more than once, we want to avoid processing a token more than once.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limit function calls in the hot path inside the <code>Scanner</code> or <code>Decoder</code>.
We want to limit the number of function to <code>O(tokens)</code>, not <code>O(bytes)</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limit copies.
If we have a design that limits copying then we reduce the number times we (re)visit a byte.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limit allocations.
If you limit the number of times data is copied, then you naturally limit allocations, which reduces runtime in several ways:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Reduce the overhead in taking the allocation.
The heap is a shared resource, allocating on the heap requires working with shared data structures.
This means locks, cache contention, etc. c.f. Amdahl’s Law <sup>[<a id="_footnoteref_1" href="#_footnotedef_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduce the overhead of freeing allocations.
The less allocations you make, the less heap you consume and the less garbage you produce.
Reducing these two factors reduces the overhead of background and foreground garbage collection.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_tokenisation"><a href="#_tokenisation"></a><a href="#_tokenisation">Tokenisation</a></h2>
<div>
<p>A JSON decoder has two main components:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A scanner, or tokeniser, that converts a stream a bytes into a stream of JSON tokens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An unmarshaller that applies a stream of JSON tokens to a Go object.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>This is rather convenient, the type of the token returned is an <code>interface{}</code> so it can represent both the value of the token, and also its type.
Strings are <code>string</code>, numbers are <code>float64</code>, booleans are <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>, even <code>null</code> is represented as a <code>nil</code>.</p>
<p>But there is a cost to this convenience, and a reason why Brad Fitzpatrick called the Token API a <a href="https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/11651/2/src/encoding/json/stream.go#279">garbage factory</a>.</p>
<p>Because of the design of the <code>Decoder.Token</code> API, the concrete value assigned to each token causes that value to escape to the heap.
The number of allocations is tied to the number of tokens in the input.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the allocations for the simplest case, a single token.</p>

<h3 id="_implicit_tokens"><a href="#_implicit_tokens"></a><a href="#_implicit_tokens">Implicit tokens</a></h3>
<p>Let’s look back at the sequence of tokens; <code>{</code> <code>"a"</code> <code>:</code> <code>1</code> <code>,</code> <code>"b"</code> <code>:</code> <code>true</code> <code>,</code> <code>"c"</code> <code>:</code> <code>[</code> <code>1</code> <code>,</code> <code>"two"</code> <code>,</code> <code>null</code> <code>]</code> and <code>}</code>.</p>
<p>It turns out that the first character in the token tells you the <em>type</em> of the token.</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>{</code>, <code>}</code> - collection start, end</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>[</code>, <code>]</code> - array start, end</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>t</code> - true</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>f</code> - false</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>n</code> - null</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>"</code> - string</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-</code>, <code>0</code>-<code>9</code> - a number</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>This is the first improvement we can make in <em>our</em> <code>Decoder.NextToken</code> APIs.
Rather than converting the input <code>[]byte</code> to a value, we just return the bytes representing the token straight from the input—​a simple subslice.
The first character in the <code>[]byte</code> will tell the type of the token.</p>

<p>There are a few subtleties with this API.</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Because the output is a subslice of the input, not a copy, there are restrictions on how long the output is valid for.
This is similar to the <code>bufio.Scanner</code> API.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sometimes people want to know type of the token; collection, array, string, number, etc, sometimes they want the token <em>value</em>, <em>the string</em>, the <em>number</em>, in a form they can work with.
<code>Decoder.NextToken</code> isn’t convenient for that, but can be used to build higher level abstractions.</p>

<h2 id="_reading"><a href="#_reading"></a><a href="#_reading">Reading</a></h2>
<div>
<p>Let’s talk about reading data.
This can be tricky to do efficiently because JSON is not length delimited, you have to read to the end of the token to find token.</p>
<div>
<h3 id="_io_reader_problems"><a href="#_io_reader_problems"></a><a href="#_io_reader_problems">io.Reader problems</a></h3>
<p>The traditional way to do this is with an <code>io.Reader</code>.</p>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="go"><span>buf</span> <span>:=</span> <span>make</span><span>([]</span><span>byte</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>10</span><span>)</span>
<span>read</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>r</span><span>.</span><span>Read</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>)</span></code></pre>
</div>
<p>But this comes with a number of problems:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>io.Reader.Read <em>copies</em> data from the reader into a buffer. That copying takes time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>io.Reader.Read makes buffer management the problem of the caller.</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You can read one <code>byte</code> at a time, but you need a place to store the thing you’re walking over, also might need to put the <code>byte</code> back.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can read into a large buffer, then look in buffer for start and end of token.
If the end token isn’t in the buffer you need to do a lot of bookkeeping and copying to move the data around the the buffer or grow the buffer to make room for more data.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>This is tricky to get right, and inefficient even if you do.</p>
<p>The alternative is an idea inspired by Steven Schveighoffer’s iopipe <sup>[<a id="_footnoteref_2" href="#_footnotedef_2" title="View footnote.">2</a>]</sup> and Phil Pearl <sup>[<a id="_footnoteref_3" href="#_footnotedef_3" title="View footnote.">3</a>]</sup> which I adapted into a type called a <code>byteReader</code>.

	<span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We start by getting the current window from the <code>byteReader</code>.
This is a <code>[]byte</code> slice of all the data that is yet to be read.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We’re looking for the first non whitespace character.
If the character is a whitespace we increment <code>s.offset</code> to ignore the character and loop around.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we do find a non whitespace character, we release <code>s.offset</code> characters from the front of the window.
Now the start of the window is properly aligned with the first character of the token.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It turns out that we also get the first character of the token for free, it’s in <code>c</code>, so we can return that as a hint to <code>Scanner.Next</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we run out of characters without hitting a token then we called <code>extend()</code> to grow the window.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we couldn’t grow, then we’ve run out of input and haven’t got a token, so give up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Otherwise update <code>w</code> with a new window.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Some things to note:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Note the lack of error handling, it’s not part of the inner loop, it only happens when we have to read more data from the underlying reader via <code>extend</code>. <sup>[<a id="_footnoteref_4" href="#_footnotedef_4" title="View footnote.">4</a>]</sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>extend</code> hides the process of reading into, growing, refilling the buffer, etc. The makes the caller--<code>Scanner.token</code>--simpler; if there is data in the window, process it, extend if you need too. If you can’t extend, give up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>release</code> is similar, it shrinks the start of the window to exclude data that no longer care about.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>extend</code> is not in the hot path, so there is no need to optimise it, its performance is a function of the buffer it is given.
In practice an initial buffer of 8k is sufficient.</p>

<p>Comparing the performance of <code>Scanner.Next</code> to our whitespace benchmark we can see that we’re between 1/4 and 2/5ths of our baseline.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about improvements we can make to the code.
Note the amount of work being spent to keep <code>s.offset</code> up to date.
We know that <code>s.offset</code> is set to 0 just before <code>Scanner.Next</code> calls this function, and we set <code>s.offset</code> to zero on the way out of the function, so the changes we make to <code>s.offset</code> within the function are invisible—​it’s zero on entry, and zero on exit.</p>
<p>We can rewrite the function to keep a local <code>offset</code> value, which has an impressive effect on <code>token</code>.</p>

<p>By keeping <code>offset</code> local the compiler avoided those temporary writes back to memory.
The question I have for you is why did this improve some inputs and not others?</p>
<p>The answer is different inputs have different amounts of whitespace.
For example <code>canada</code> only has 33 whitespace characters whereas <code>citm</code> has 1,227,563.</p>
<details>
<summary>Quiz me after the talk why the compiler can’t optimise these writes away.</summary>

<div>
<h3 id="_inlining"><a href="#_inlining"></a><a href="#_inlining">Inlining</a></h3>
<p>There is a larger improvement we can make for the runtime of this code, and it relates to inlining.
Inlining is the process of automatically (or manually) copying the body of a function into, <em>in line with</em>, its caller.
This avoids the overhead of the function call.</p>
<p>The Go compiler has reasonable support for inlining, but has a number of limitations.</p>
<div>
<pre><code> % go build -gcflags=-m=2 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep cannot | grep -v decoder
./reader.go:31:6: cannot inline (*byteReader).extend: function too complex: cost 198 exceeds budget 80
./scanner.go:99:6: cannot inline (*Scanner).token: unhandled op FOR
./scanner.go:130:6: cannot inline validateToken: unhandled op FOR
./scanner.go:153:6: cannot inline parseString: unhandled op FOR
./scanner.go:182:6: cannot inline (*Scanner).parseNumber: unhandled op FOR
./scanner.go:56:6: cannot inline (*Scanner).Next: function too complex: cost 476 exceeds budget 80</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The first is the size of the function, <code>byteReader.extend</code> cannot be inlined because it is too complex.
<sup>[<a id="_footnoteref_5" href="#_footnotedef_5" title="View footnote.">5</a>]</sup>
The second is statements within the function, <code>Scanner.token</code> cannot be inlined because it contains a <code>for</code> statement.</p>
<p>Let’s go back to the constraints:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Scanner.Next</code> is called for each token in the input.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This means that <code>Scanner.token</code> is called for each token in the input.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Scanner.token</code> cannot be automatically inlined into its caller because it is too complex.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore we’re paying <em>two</em> function calls per token.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>We can remove one of these by manually inlining <code>Scanner.token</code> into its caller.</p>

<p>By saving the function call we’ve improved throughput by 9-24%.
The largest improvement comes from <code>canada</code>, which basically contained no whitespace, so the call to <code>Scanner.token</code> almost always returned immediately having done no work!</p>
<p>To recap the major optimisations were:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Avoiding <code>s.offset</code> updates. They cannot be registerised, CPU has to do a write on every iteration.
<code>s.offset</code> updates reduced from one per byte to one per token.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Scanner.Next</code> and <code>Scanner.token</code> were effectively one function spread over two.
Each are too large to be inlined, so we’re paying for an extra function call per token.
Manually inlining them increased the indentation depth of the function, but delivered substantial speedups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Most</em> JSON contains some whitespace, it’s moderately optimised for human readability.
It turns out, the more whitespace, the faster <code>pkg/json</code> decodes! <code>citm</code> is over 50% of the baseline, <code>sample</code> is nearly 75%.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Take away: Avoiding function calls <em>can</em> improve performance in the hot path.</p>

<div>
<p>So far we have a <code>Scanner</code> which tokenises input at 50-75% of the whitespace baseline.
But there are a few more things we need to make the scanner fully functional.</p>
<p>The first part of that is validation.</p>
<div>
<h3 id="_validation"><a href="#_validation"></a><a href="#_validation">Validation</a></h3>
<p>JSON is a state machine.
Depending on the current token, only certain subsequent tokens are valid.
For example, if you’ve read these tokens <code>{</code>, <code>"username"</code>, then the only valid token is <code>:</code>.
To track this we need to layer some logic on top of <code>Scanner.Next</code> to assert that a sequence of token is valid.
This is the role of <code>Decoder.NextToken</code>:</p>

<p>This is pretty straightforward stuff.
We take track the current state in <code>d.state</code> and based on its value we dispatch to the various state methods which assert token is valid and update the state.</p>

<p><code>switch</code> is convenient, but not optimal in the hot path because that long sequence of <code>if</code> statements breaks up the instruction stream, and the puts pressure on the CPU’s branch predictor. Mispredicting a branch is expensive, the CPU has to flush the pipeline, rewind, and take the other branch.</p>
<p>This problem turns up in many places; bytecode interpreters are a classic example.
One of the optimisations we could make is is to turn this linear search into a table.
This can be space efficient if the state space is small and dense (often it is not), and the result might be something like this</p>

<p>But there is a better trick that we <em>can</em> use that is more space efficient than this table, and is sometimes called a <em>computed goto</em>.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="_computed_goto"><a href="#_computed_goto"></a><a href="#_computed_goto">Computed Goto</a></h3>
<p>If you look at the table above there is a pattern.
Each <code>state</code> enumeration is matched with exactly one method.
What we store in <code>d.state</code> is a proxy for the method we want to call, but to call the method, we have to <code>switch</code> on <code>d.state</code> to find the appropriate method.</p>
<p>What if we could just store the method directly and call it directly?
And infact, we can do just that with some old Go 1.0 magic, <a href="https://golang.org/ref/spec#Method_expressions"><em>method expression</em></a>.</p>

<span>// repeated for each Decoder.state... method</span></code></pre>
</div>
<p>Moving the <code>tok := d.scanner.Next()</code> call into each state method might seem like a step backwards, but it has several positive effects.</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The first is not passing <code>tok</code> into each state method.
This saves 3 words on the call stack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second is, by moving the <code>if len(tok) &lt; 1</code> into the same function as the  <code>switch</code>, it enables bounds check elimination.</p>
<p>Previously, when the <code>len(tok)</code> check happened in <code>Decoder.NextToken</code>, <code>Decoder.stateObjectColon</code> doesn’t know anything about the length of <code>tok</code> because it can’t be inlined because we’re calling it via a method expression.
When the compiler encounters <code>switch tok[0]</code>, it needs to put a bounds check to make sure <code>tok</code> is at least 1 element long.</p>
<p>When the <code>if</code> check is moved into the same function, the compiler knows that if we get further than the check then <code>tok</code> is at least 1 element long, so the bounds check is not needed.</p>
<p>We can see this in the debug information.</p>

<dt>Allocations affect performance</dt>
<dd>
<p>The garbage collector might be fast to allocate and efficient to collect, but not allocating will always be faster.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Eliminating allocations through API design</dt>
<dd>
<p>Most of the speedups of this package come from reducing allocations; specifically the time <em>not</em> spent in the heap allocation path, and the time not spent in GC cycles, is available for scanning.</p>
</dd>
<dt>API design influences performance</dt>
<dd>
<p>The <code>encoding/json.Decoder</code> API <em>requires</em> allocations as returning a primitive value via an interface causes it to escape to the heap — it effectively becomes a pointer to the value.
When dealing with <em>data</em>, allocations, can be the biggest performance cost of an algorithm.
You’re benchmarking the garbage collector at that point.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Careful attention to the per byte and per token overheads</dt>
<dd>
<p>Optimising the hot path to convert functions per byte into per token functions is the second biggest performance win.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>I started this project because I wanted to apply some ideas that I had seen to a problem in Go.
I believed that it was possible implement an efficient JSON parser based on my <em>assumption</em> that <code>encoding/json</code> was slower than it could be because of its API.</p>
<p>It turned out there is 2-3x performance in some unmarshalling paths and between 8x and 10x performance in tokenisation, if you’re prepared to accept a different API.</p>

                                    <p><span>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will begin the process to limit and possibly eliminate a chemical commonly used in car tires, after scientific studies found that the chemical — commonly known as 6PPD — is fatal to salmon.</span></p>
<p><span>The EPA </span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-grants-tribal-petition-protect-salmon-lethal-chemical"><span>announced its regulatory plans Thursday</span></a><span>, answering a petition from three Native Tribes in the Pacific Northwest. The states of Washington, Oregon, Vermont, Rhode Island and Connecticut also supported the petition.</span></p>
<p><span>It likely will take years for the EPA’s rulemaking process to take effect; the agency’s first step will be to require tire manufacturers to share their unpublished health and safety studies, but that’s not expected before the end of 2024.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A University of Washington study, funded by the EPA and published in late December 2020, </span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.adn.com/nation-world/2020/12/04/killer-of-returning-puget-sound-salmon-is-hidden-in-plain-sight-scientists-say/"><span>conclusively linked 6PPD to mass die-offs of coho salmon</span></a><span> in urban waterways around Seattle.</span></p>
<p><span>Followup studies </span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/feature-story/roadway-runoff-known-kill-coho-salmon-also-affects-steelhead-chinook-salmon"><span>by the National Marine Fisheries Service</span></a><span> and </span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.usgs.gov/publications/tire-derived-transformation-product-6ppd-quinone-induces-mortality-and"><span>the U.S. Geological Survey</span></a><span>, among others, have repeatedly confirmed the results.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The 6PPD chemical is </span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.ustires.org/6ppd-and-tire-manufacturing"><span>used by all major tire manufacturers</span></a><span> to reduce degradation and cracking. Tires deposit small amounts of rubber on the road with each revolution, and those deposits contain 6PPD, which then washes into neighboring waterways with snow and rain.</span></p>
<p><span>Limited testing has been done in Alaska, home to the nation’s largest salmon runs, but preliminary sampling in Anchorage in 2021 </span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.alaskasnewssource.com/2021/09/18/scientist-samples-anchorage-creeks-chemical-that-could-be-killing-fish/"><span>found levels of 6PPD that are lethal to coho salmon</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://annas-blog.org/duxiu-exclusive.html">https://annas-blog.org/duxiu-exclusive.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38149093">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  
  <p>
    annas-blog.org, 2023-10-04, <a href="https://annas-blog.org/duxiu-exclusive-chinese.html">Chinese version 中文版</a>, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38149093">Discuss on Hacker News</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    <em><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Anna’s Archive acquired a unique collection of 7.5 million / 350TB Chinese non-fiction books — larger than Library Genesis. We’re willing to give an LLM company exclusive access, in exchange for high-quality OCR and text extraction.</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    This is a short blog post. We’re looking for some company or institution to help us with OCR and text extraction for a massive collection we acquired, in exchange for exclusive early access. After the embargo period, we will of course release the entire collection.
  </p>

  <p>
    High-quality academic text is extremely useful for training of LLMs. While our collection is Chinese, this should be even useful for training English LLMs: models seem encode concepts and knowledge regardless of the source language.
  </p>

  <p>
    For this, text needs to be extracted from the scans. What does Anna’s Archive get out of it? Full-text search of the books for its users.
  </p>

  <p>
    Because our goals align with that of LLM developers, we’re looking for a collaborator. We’re willing to give you <strong>exclusive early access to this collection in bulk for 1 year</strong>, if you can do proper OCR and text extraction. If you’re willing to share the entire code of your pipeline with us, we’d be willing to embargo the collection for longer.
  </p>

  <h3>Example pages</h3>

  <p>
    To prove to us that you have a good pipeline, here are some example pages to get started on, from a book on superconductors. Your pipeline should properly handle math, tables, charts, footnotes, and so on.
  </p>

  <p><a href="https://annas-blog.org/duxiu-examples/1.jpg"><img src="https://annas-blog.org/duxiu-examples/1.jpg"></a>
    <a href="https://annas-blog.org/duxiu-examples/2.jpg"><img src="https://annas-blog.org/duxiu-examples/2.jpg"></a>
  </p>
  <p><a href="https://annas-blog.org/duxiu-examples/3.jpg"><img src="https://annas-blog.org/duxiu-examples/3.jpg"></a>
    <a href="https://annas-blog.org/duxiu-examples/4.jpg"><img src="https://annas-blog.org/duxiu-examples/4.jpg"></a>
  </p>

  <p>
    Send your processed pages to <a href="https://annas-blog.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c988a7a7a888bbaaa1a0bfa0babd89b9bba6bda6a7e7a4ac"><span data-cfemail="6928070708281b0a01001f001a1d29191b061d060747040c">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a>. If they look good, we will send you more in private, and we expect you to be able to quickly run your pipeline on those as well. Once we’re satisfied, we can make a deal.
  </p>

  <h3>Collection</h3>

  <p>
    Some more information about the collection. <a href="https://www.duxiu.com/bottom/about.html">Duxiu</a> is a massive database of scanned books, created by the <a href="https://www.chaoxing.com/">SuperStar Digital Library Group</a>. Most are academic books, scanned in order to make them available digitally to universities and libraries. For our English-speaking audience, <a href="https://library.princeton.edu/eastasian/duxiu">Princeton</a> and the <a href="https://guides.lib.uw.edu/c.php?g=341344&amp;p=2303522">University of Washington</a> have good overviews. There is also an excellent article giving more background: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acalib.2009.03.012">“Digitizing Chinese Books: A Case Study of the SuperStar DuXiu Scholar Search Engine”</a> (look it up in Anna’s Archive).
  </p>

  <p>
    The books from Duxiu have long been pirated on the Chinese internet. Usually they are being sold for less than a dollar by resellers. They are typically distributed using the Chinese equivalent of Google Drive, which has often been hacked to allow for more storage space. Some technical details can be found <a href="https://github.com/duty-machine/duty-machine/issues/2010">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/821/821.github.io/blob/7bbcdc8dd2ec4bb637480e054fe760821b4ad7b8/_Notes/IT/DX-CX.md">here</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Though the books have been semi-publicly distributed, it is quite difficult to obtain them in bulk. We had this high on our TODO-list, and allocated multiple months of full-time work for it. However, recently an incredible, amazing, and talented volunteer reached out to us, telling us they had done all this work already — at great expense. They shared the full collection with us, without expecting anything in return, except the guarantee of long-term preservation. Truly remarkable. They agreed to ask for help in this way to get the collection OCR'ed.
  </p>

  <p>
    The collection is 7,543,702 files. This is more than Library Genesis non-fiction (about 5.3 million). Total file size is about 359TB (326TiB) in its current form.
  </p>

  <p>
    We’re open to other proposals and ideas. Just contact us. Check out Anna’s Archive for more information about our collections, preservation efforts, and how you can help. Thanks!

<h2>Backward Incompatible Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>The <code>weight</code>, <code>style</code> and <code>variant</code> arguments for <code>Font</code> and <code>Font.register</code> are now keyword-only. (<a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1684013736" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/1903" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/beeware/toga/pull/1903/hovercard" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1903">#1903</a>)</li>
<li>The <code>clear()</code> method for resetting the value of a MultilineTextInput, TextInput and PasswordInput has been removed. This method was an ambiguous override of the <code>clear()</code> method on Widget that removed all child nodes. To remove all content from a text input widget, use <code>widget.value = ""</code>. (<a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1703245364" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/1938" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/beeware/toga/pull/1938/hovercard" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1938">#1938</a>)</li>
<li>The ability to perform multiple substring matches in a <code>Contains</code> validator has been removed. (<a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1715041095" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/1944" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/beeware/toga/pull/1944/hovercard" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1944">#1944</a>)</li>
<li>The <code>TextInput.validate</code> method has been removed. Validation now happens automatically whenever the <code>value</code> or <code>validators</code> properties are changed. (<a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1715041095" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/1944" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/beeware/toga/pull/1944/hovercard" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1944">#1944</a>)</li>
<li>The argument names used to construct validators have changed. Error message arguments now all end with <code>_message</code>; <code>compare_count</code> has been renamed <code>count</code>; and <code>min_value</code> and <code>max_value</code> have been renamed <code>min_length</code> and <code>max_length</code>, respectively. (<a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1715041095" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/1944" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/beeware/toga/pull/1944/hovercard" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1944">#1944</a>)</li>
<li>The <code>get_dom()</code> method on WebView has been removed. This method wasn't implemented on most platforms, and wasn't working on any of the platforms where it <em>was</em> implemented, as modern web view implementations don't provide a synchronous API for accessing web content in this way. (<a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1725112199" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/1949" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/beeware/toga/pull/1949/hovercard" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1949">#1949</a>)</li>
<li>The <code>evaluate_javascript()</code> method on WebView has been modified to work in both synchronous and asynchronous contexts. In a synchronous context you can invoke the method and use a functional <code>on_result</code> callback to be notified when evaluation is complete. In an asynchronous context, you can await the result. (<a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1725112199" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/1949" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/beeware/toga/pull/1949/hovercard" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1949">#1949</a>)</li>
<li>The <code>on_key_down</code> handler has been removed from WebView. If you need to catch user input, either use a handler in the embedded JavaScript, or create a <code>Command</code> with a key shortcut. (<a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1725112199" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/1949" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/beeware/toga/pull/1949/hovercard" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1949">#1949</a>)</li>
<li>The <code>invoke_javascript()</code> method has been removed. All usage of <code>invoke_javascript()</code> can be replaced with <code>evaluate_javascript()</code>. (<a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1725112199" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/1949" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/beeware/toga/pull/1949/hovercard" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1949">#1949</a>)</li>
<li>The usage of local <code>file://</code> URLs has been explicitly prohibited. <code>file://</code> URLs have not been reliable for some time; their usage is now explicitly prohibited. (<a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1725112199" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/1949" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/beeware/toga/pull/1949/hovercard" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1949">#1949</a>)</li>
<li><code>DatePicker</code> has been renamed <code>DateInput</code>.

<li>The <code>on_select</code> handler on the Selection widget has been renamed <code>on_change</code> for consistency with other widgets. (<a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1731722661" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/1955" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/beeware/toga/pull/1955/hovercard" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1955">#1955</a>)</li>
<li>The <code>_notify()</code> method on data sources has been renamed <code>notify()</code>, reflecting its status as a public API. (<a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1731722661" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/1955" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/beeware/toga/pull/1955/hovercard" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1955">#1955</a>)</li>
<li>The <code>prepend()</code> method was removed from the <code>ListSource</code> and <code>TreeSource</code> APIs. Calls to <code>prepend(...)</code> can be replaced with <code>insert(0, ...)</code>. (<a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1731722661" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/1955" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/beeware/toga/pull/1955/hovercard" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1955">#1955</a>)</li>
<li>The <code>insert()</code> and <code>append()</code> APIs on <code>ListSource</code> and <code>TreeSource</code> have been modified to provide an interface that is closer to that <code>list</code> API. These methods previously accepted a variable list of positional and keyword arguments; these arguments should be combined into a single tuple or dictionary. This matches the API provided by <code>__setitem__()</code>. (<a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1731722661" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/1955" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/beeware/toga/pull/1955/hovercard" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1955">#1955</a>)</li>
<li>Images and ImageViews no longer support loading images from URLs. If you need to display an image from a URL, use a background task to obtain the image data asynchronously, then create the Image and/or set the ImageView <code>image</code> property on the completion of the asynchronous load. (<a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1732653143" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/1956" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/beeware/toga/pull/1956/hovercard" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1956">#1956</a>)</li>
<li>A row box contained inside a row box will now expand to the full height of its parent, rather than collapsing to the maximum height of the inner box's child content. (<a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1740132597" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/1958" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/beeware/toga/pull/1958/hovercard" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1958">#1958</a>)</li>
<li>A column box contained inside a column box will now expand to the full width of its parent, rather than collapsing to the maximum width of the inner box's child content. (<a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1740132597" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/1958" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/beeware/toga/pull/1958/hovercard" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1958">#1958</a>)</li>
<li>On Android, the user data folder is now a <code>data</code> sub-directory of the location returned by <code>context.getFilesDir()</code>, rather than the bare <code>context.getFilesDir()</code> location. (<a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1743217798" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/1964" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/beeware/toga/pull/1964/hovercard" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1964">#1964</a>)</li>
<li>GTK now returns <code>~/.local/state/appname/log</code> as the log file location, rather than <code>~/.cache/appname/log</code>. (<a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1743217798" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/1964" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/beeware/toga/pull/1964/hovercard" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1964">#1964</a>)</li>
<li>The location returned by <code>toga.App.paths.app</code> is now the folder that contains the Python source file that defines the app class used by the app. If you are using a <code>toga.App</code> instance directly, this may alter the path that is returned. (<a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1743217798" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/1964" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/beeware/toga/pull/1964/hovercard" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1964">#1964</a>)</li>
<li>On Winforms, if an application doesn't define an author, an author of <code>Unknown</code> is now used in application data paths, rather than <code>Toga</code>. (<a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1743217798" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/1964" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/beeware/toga/pull/1964/hovercard" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1964">#1964</a>)</li>
<li>Winforms now returns <code>%USERPROFILE%/AppData/Local/&lt;Author Name&gt;/&lt;App Name&gt;/Data</code> as the user data file location, rather than <code>%USERPROFILE%/AppData/Local/&lt;Author Name&gt;/&lt;App Name&gt;</code>. (<a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1743217798" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/1964" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/beeware/toga/pull/1964/hovercard" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1964">#1964</a>)</li>
<li>Support for SplitContainers with more than 2 panels of content has been removed. (<a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1755955287" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/1984" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/beeware/toga/pull/1984/hovercard" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1984">#1984</a>)</li>
<li>Support for 3-tuple form of specifying SplitContainer items, used to prevent panels from resizing, has been removed. (<a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1755955287" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/1984" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/beeware/toga/pull/1984/hovercard" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1984">#1984</a>)</li>
<li>The ability to increment and decrement the current OptionContainer tab was removed. Instead of <code>container.current_tab += 1</code>, use <code>container.current_tab = container.current_tab.index + 1</code> (<a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1762669754" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/1996" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/beeware/toga/pull/1996/hovercard" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1996">#1996</a>)</li>
<li><code>OptionContainer.add()</code>, <code>OptionContainer.remove()</code> and <code>OptionContainer.insert()</code> have been removed, due to being ambiguous with base widget methods of the same name. Use the <code>OptionContainer.content.append()</code>, <code>OptionContainer.content.remove()</code> and <code>OptionContainer.content.insert()</code> APIs instead. (<a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1762669754" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/1996" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/beeware/toga/pull/1996/hovercard" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1996">#1996</a>)</li>
<li>The <code>on_select</code> handler for OptionContainer no longer receives the <code>option</code> argument providing the selected tab. Use <code>current_tab</code> to obtain the currently selected tab. (<a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1762669754" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/1996" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/beeware/toga/pull/1996/hovercard" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1996">#1996</a>)</li>
<li><code>TimePicker.min_time</code> and <code>TimePicker.max_time</code> has been renamed <code>TimeInput.min</code> and <code>TimeInput.max</code>, respectively. (<a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1764283659" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/1999" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/beeware/toga/issues/1999/hovercard" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/1999">#1999</a>)</li>
<li><code>DatePicker.min_date</code> and <code>DatePicker.max_date</code> has been renamed <code>DateInput.min</code> and <code>DateInput.max</code>, respectively.

<li>Tables now use an empty string for the default missing value, rather than warning about missing values. (<a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1770896112" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/2011" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/beeware/toga/pull/2011/hovercard" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2011">#2011</a>)</li>
<li><code>Table.add_column()</code> has been deprecated in favor of <code>Table.append_column()</code> and <code>Table.insert_column()</code> (<a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1770896112" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/2011" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/beeware/toga/pull/2011/hovercard" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2011">#2011</a>)</li>

<li>Trees now use an empty string for the default missing value, rather than warning about missing values. (<a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1778297336" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/2017" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/beeware/toga/pull/2017/hovercard" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2017">#2017</a>)</li>
<li>The <code>parent</code> argument has been removed from the <code>insert</code> and <code>append</code> calls on <code>TreeSource</code>. This improves consistency between the API for <code>TreeSource</code> and the API for <code>list</code>. To insert or append a row in to a descendant of a TreeSource root, use <code>insert</code> and <code>append</code> on the parent node itself - i.e., <code>source.insert(parent, index, ...)</code> becomes <code>parent.insert(index, ...)</code>, and <code>source.insert(None, index, ...)</code> becomes <code>source.insert(index, ...)</code>. (<a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1778297336" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/2017" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/beeware/toga/pull/2017/hovercard" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2017">#2017</a>)</li>
<li>When constructing a DetailedList from a list of tuples, or a list of lists, the required order of values has changed from (icon, title, subtitle) to (title, subtitle, icon). (<a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1787135240" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/2025" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/beeware/toga/pull/2025/hovercard" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2025">#2025</a>)</li>
<li>The <code>on_select</code> handler for DetailedList no longer receives the selected row as an argument. (<a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1787135240" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/2025" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/beeware/toga/pull/2025/hovercard" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2025">#2025</a>)</li>
<li>The handling of row deletion in DetailedList widgets has been significantly altered. The <code>on_delete</code> event handler has been renamed <code>on_primary_action</code>, and is now <em>only</em> a notification that a "swipe left" event (or platform equivalent) has been confirmed. This was previously inconsistent across platforms. Some platforms would update the data source to remove the row; some treated <code>on_delete</code> as a notification event and expected the application to handle the deletion. It is now the application's responsibility to perform the data deletion. (<a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="1787135240" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/2025" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/beeware/toga/pull/2025/hovercard" href="https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2025">#2025</a>)</li>
<li>Support for Python 3.7 was removed.

<li><code>fill()</code> and <code>stroke()</code> now return simple drawing operations, rather than context managers. If you attempt to use <code>fill()</code> or <code>stroke()</code> on a context as a context manager, an exception will be raised; using these methods on Canvas will raise a warning, but return the appropriate context manager.

<li>The <code>clicks</code> argument to <code>Canvas.on_press</code> has been removed. Instead, to detect "double clicks", you should use <code>Canvas.on_activate</code>. The <code>clicks</code> argument has also been removed from <code>Canvas.on_release</code>, <code>Canvas.on_drag</code>, <code>Canvas.on_alt_press</code>, <code>Canvas.on_alt_release</code>, and <code>Canvas.on_alt_drag</code>.

<li>The <code>new_path</code> operation has been renamed <code>begin_path</code> for consistency with the HTML5 Canvas API.

<li>Methods that generate new contexts have been renamed: <code>context()</code>, <code>closed_path()</code>, <code>fill()</code> and <code>stroke()</code> have become <code>Context()</code>, <code>ClosedPath()</code>, <code>Fill()</code> and <code>Stroke()</code> respectively. This has been done to make it easier to differentiate between primitive drawing operations and context-generating operations.

<li>A Canvas is no longer implicitly a context object. The <code>Canvas.context</code> property now returns the root context of the canvas. If you were previously using <code>Canvas.context()</code> to generate an empty context, it should be replaced with <code>Canvas.Context()</code>. Any operations to <code>remove()</code> drawing objects from the canvas or <code>clear()</code> the canvas of drawing objects should be made on <code>Canvas.context</code>. Invoking these methods on <code>Canvas</code> will now call the base <code>Widget</code> implementations, which will throw an exception because <code>Canvas</code> widgets cannot have children.

<li>The <code>preserve</code> option on <code>Fill()</code> operations has been deprecated. It was required for an internal optimization and can be safely removed without impact.

<li>Drawing operations (e.g., <code>arc</code>, <code>line_to</code>, etc) can no longer be invoked directly on a Canvas. Instead, they should be invoked on the root context of the canvas, retrieved with via the <code>canvas</code> property. Context creating operations (<code>Fill</code>, <code>Stroke</code> and <code>ClosedPath</code>) are not affected.

<li>The <code>tight</code> argument to <code>Canvas.measure_text()</code> has been deprecated. It was a GTK implementation detail, and can be safely removed without impact.

<li>The <code>multiselect</code> argument to Open File and Select Folder dialogs has been renamed <code>multiple_select</code>, for consistency with other widgets that have multiple selection capability.

<li>In <code>App</code>, the properties <code>id</code> and <code>name</code> have been deprecated in favor of <code>app_id</code> and <code>formal_name</code> respectively, and the property <code>module_name</code> has been removed.

<li><code>GROUP_BREAK</code>, <code>SECTION_BREAK</code> and <code>CommandSet</code> were removed from the <code>toga</code> namespace. End users generally shouldn't need to use these classes.

        <p><em>Editor’s Note: This article ends on a cliffhanger. The next part goes out in a week.</em></p><hr><p>I will start with an honest admission. I didn’t set out to write about the world’s first app store. I set out to write about Brother printers.</p><p>But doing my research, I stumbled upon something <em>amazing </em>they built in the 80s – the world’s first app store. And between “Awesome printer” and “World’s first app store”, the choice was clear.</p><h2 id="setting-the-scene">Setting the Scene</h2><p>The year was 1986 and Japan was at the peak of its economic miracle. Japan's technology industry was booming and personal computers were catching on like wildfire.</p><p>I watch a lot of older Japanese dramas and I find it shocking how in every new season there is a newer, slimmer, more capable computer.</p><p>Of course hardware is useless without software. And software was just <em>flying</em> off the shelves.</p><p>For our younger readers: In the medieval ages, software used to be sold in packages. In brick-and-mortar stores. You had to actually stand in line to buy software...</p><figure><img src="https://one-from-nippon.ghost.io/content/images/2023/11/5171002135_ca1d77129b_b.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="681" srcset="https://one-from-nippon.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/11/5171002135_ca1d77129b_b.jpg 600w, https://one-from-nippon.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/11/5171002135_ca1d77129b_b.jpg 1000w, https://one-from-nippon.ghost.io/content/images/2023/11/5171002135_ca1d77129b_b.jpg 1024w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>See that stack of floppies on the bottom left?

Tough luck. Need to release an update? Lol, no.</p><p>Japan’s software market was so hot that retailers could not keep up with the demand. For highly anticipated games, shelves ran empty as soon as they were stocked. Getting new stock took time, leaving the creators, retailers, and customers, all sad.</p><h2 id="brother-industries">Brother Industries</h2><p>Enter Yuichi Yasutomo.</p><p>Yuichi worked at Brother Industries.</p><p>Brother was founded in 1934 and had its first success manufacturing sewing machines. Over the next few decades they built up a culture of tackling problems in domains they had no experience with, and the technical expertise to back it up. By the 1980s, they had their hands in everything from sewing machines, to typewriters, to washing machines, to CNC equipment.</p><p>It was in such an organization that the world’s first app store was born.</p><p>Three things came together for the world’s first app store to show up: technical prowess, changes to the law, and a booming market.</p><h3 id="the-videotex">The Videotex</h3><p>In 1985, Brother worked with the state monopoly telecom company, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT), to build a “videotex” network, a precursor to the internet (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videotex?ref=one-from-nippon.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer">Wiki</a> for the interested).</p><p>Brother's engineers contributed significantly in building compression algorithms to make downloads faster on this system. While videotex as a technology fizzled out, it left Brother's engineers with serious technical chops in data transmission.</p><h3 id="the-ntt-law">The NTT Law</h3><p>In 1985, the NTT Law was passed, privatizing all telecommunications. What used to be a state monopoly was now open to everyone. Anybody with the capital and skills could start their own phone, fax, or pager company.</p><p>A booming demand for software, the technical skills Brother had amassed, and the NTT Law – all this set the canvas that Yuichi’s team painted on.</p><hr><h2 id="rethinking-software-distribution">Rethinking Software Distribution</h2><p>Yuichi’s central insight was that people only cared about the <em>contents</em> of the floppy disk, not the disk itself.</p><p>If they could invent a machine that could sell the <em>contents</em> of the floppy disk and wrote that to an empty floppy disk, that would turn the world on its head – software need not be packaged, boxed, or trucked to a store.</p><p>Exploring different designs, the team landed on the idea for a “software vending machine” that would leapfrog all these pesky packaging problems.</p><p>They named it “Soft Vendor Takeru” (yeah, that sounds wrong in English but I must hurry to clarify that in Japanese long words are shortened to half. “Software” becomes “soft”, “hardware” becomes “hard”).</p><figure><img src="https://one-from-nippon.ghost.io/content/images/2023/10/Takeru-1.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="750" height="568" srcset="https://one-from-nippon.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/10/Takeru-1.jpg 600w, https://one-from-nippon.ghost.io/content/images/2023/10/Takeru-1.jpg 750w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>Soft Vendor Takeru </span><i><em>Source: </em></i><a href="https://museum.global.brother/storage/image/en/032_01.jpg?ref=one-from-nippon.ghost.io" rel="noreferrer"><i><em>Brother Industries</em></i></a></figcaption></figure><p>These vending machines were like no other vending machine people had seen. They had a screen, a floppy disk dispenser, a connection to Brother’s servers over the phone line, and a printer.</p><p>Here is how it worked:</p><ul><li>Put in money and buy an empty floppy disk</li><li>Insert the disk into the vending machine </li><li>Used the screen to choose the software you wanted </li><li>Pay for the software</li><li>Takeru downloaded the software from its server and wrote it to the floppy</li><li>???</li><li>Go home with software!</li></ul><p>If the software came with a manual (as it often did those days), the inbuilt printer would print that out for you.</p><p>It may sound clunky now, but in 1986 it was such a revolutionary invention that it quickly became an attraction. Forget empty shelves, you could simply <em>download</em> games that were out of stock!</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IXSvoPKnS1o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" title="CM 1986 ブラザー ソフトベンダー武尊"></iframe><figcaption><p><span>1986 commercial for Takeru</span></p></figcaption></figure><h3 id="democratizing-software">Democratizing Software</h3><p>This way of selling software had far-reaching consequences in the market.</p><p>Yes, it eased the problems of the creators, retailers, and customers, but importantly, it democratized software.

                                        <p>CHICAGO (AP) — Brunch dates and flag football games might be a little easier to get to this Sunday, when phones grace early-risers with an extra hour of rest before alarm clocks go off.</p><p>The downside: Next week across most of the U.S., the sun will set well before many folks step foot out of the office, leaving them to run errands or take walks in utter darkness. Come Nov. 5, daylight saving time is out and standard time is in, and will last until March 10.</p><p>No need to wait till the midnight hour to prepare for the time change that clocks in early Sunday, when 2 a.m. becomes 1 a.m. Before bed beckons Saturday night, rewind the clock on the microwave, oven, car, or any other device not yet clever enough to make the leap on its own. </p>
    

<p>Besides scheduling stumbles and sleep habit disruptions, experts say the twice-yearly ritual can have <span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-science-us-news-accidents-weekend-reads-0316d6f8d11a41b3a32135770879cdf5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more serious effects on human health</a></span>.</p>



<p>Many Americans are already sleep-deprived, and a change in time messes with sleep schedules even more, says Dr. Phyllis Zee, a sleep researcher at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago, although she says “falling back” and gaining an extra hour is generally easier on the body than “springing forward” and losing one.</p>
<p>Chronic sleep deprivation can increase levels of stress hormones that boost heart rate and blood pressure, and of chemicals that trigger inflammation, research suggests.</p><p>“Just that one hour can change the amount of sleep you get, the quality of sleep that you get,” Zee said. Off-kilter sleep can affect people’s ability to multitask, stay alert, and even maintain their balance, making them more prone to accidents.</p>
    

<p>Molly Hart, spokeswoman for AAA’s Auto Club Group, warned that there may be an uptick in accidents on the road following the time change.</p><p>“With daylight savings coming to an end, what people really need to be focused on is their driving now in the afternoon when it’s darker earlier,” and when they may be feeling drowsy, she said.</p><p>Hawaii, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and most of Arizona do not observe daylight saving time.</p><p>Some members of Congress have pushed to end the back-and-forth and make daylight saving time permanent.</p><div data-module-tracksubscribe="" data-align-center="">

<p>The Food and Drug Administration may finally ban a food additive used in citrusy drinks that the agency determined over 50 years ago could not be considered generally safe. The agency <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/11/03/2023-24084/revocation-of-authorization-for-use-of-brominated-vegetable-oil-in-food#print">proposed a ban on the additive Thursday</a>.</p>
<p>The additive is brominated vegetable oil (BVO), which is a flavoring emulsifier and stabilizer that has been used to keep citrus flavoring from separating and floating to the top of soft drinks since the 1920s. It was previously used in big brand-name beverages such as Mountain Dew and Gatorade but has been removed amid toxicity concerns in recent years. Since at least 2014, PepsiCo and Coca-Cola have been phasing out BVO from their drinks, though it can still be found in some store-brand sodas and regional drinks, including <a href="https://www.kdpproductfacts.com/product/a0e3h000003LK9KAAW/sun-drop-citrus-flavored-soda-20-fl-oz-us?redirect=false">the citrus soda Sun Drop</a>.
</p><p>BVO is already banned in Europe, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand. In October of this year, California banned BVO, along with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2023/10/common-red-food-dye-banned-in-calif-30-years-after-fda-found-cancer-risk-in-rats/">other problematic food additives, including red dye No. 3</a>. (While reporting California's ban on red dye No. 3, Ars also reported that the FDA planned to ban BVO.)</p>
<p>The FDA's proposed ban on BVO is a long time coming. Toxicity concerns have dogged BVO for over 50 years. The brominated oil accumulates in fat, the liver, heart, and brain over time, and there are long-standing concerns of thyroid toxicity, developmental neurotoxicity, and reproductive toxicity.</p>
<p>In January 1970, the FDA revoked BVO's status as GRAS, or "Generally Recognized As Safe." At that time, manufacturers were using BVO at a level of up to 150 parts per million (ppm) in beverages. In response, the additive industry petitioned the FDA to keep allowing the use of BVO, but at a lower limit of 15 ppm. The FDA was still not convinced it was safe and called for additional long-term safety studies. But, it didn't outright reject the request—instead, the agency allowed the use of BVO at the lower limit while the safety studies were being conducted, citing "an adequate margin of safety" at the reduced level.</p>                                            
                                                        
<h2>Not so fast or nimble</h2>
<p>At first, the authorization to use BVO at 15 ppm was only on an interim basis—a three-year term as the agency awaited more data. But, in 1974, still waiting for more data, the interim basis became an "indefinite period," which is ongoing.</p>
<p>In a 2014 review of BVO, the FDA recognized the "unresolved safety questions" and designed rodent studies to address them, which were eventually run by the National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR). While neurotoxicity and reproductive toxicity were among the lingering questions, the NCTR studies only looked at bioaccumulation and thyroid toxicity, noting that if these showed toxicity, it would be enough to revoke the authorization of BVO. The studies did show toxicity.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0278691522003350">The rat experiments</a>, published in 2022, used levels of BVO that mimicked dietary exposure of humans at the 15 ppm limit. In feeding trials, researchers found abnormalities in the rats' thyroids, alterations in their hormone signaling, and accumulation of brominated fatty acids in the heart, liver, and fat of all animals fed BVO.</p>
<p>"[W]e can no longer conclude that there is a reasonable certainty of no harm from the use of BVO as a stabilizer for flavoring oils in fruit-flavored beverages," the FDA said <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/11/03/2023-24084/revocation-of-authorization-for-use-of-brominated-vegetable-oil-in-food#print">in its proposal to revoke authorization</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-proposes-ban-food-additive-continues-assessments-additional-chemicals">a separate statement</a>, James Jones, the FDA's Deputy Commissioner for Human Foods, noted that these types of safety reviews take time, but seemed to acknowledge the agency's extremely slow process. He pointed to a proposed internal restructuring at the FDA that will "include the creation of the Office of Food Chemical Safety, Dietary Supplements and Innovation where we intend to develop a faster and more nimble process for evaluating chemicals in the food supply."</p>
<p>Jones also noted that the FDA is currently reviewing red dye No. 3, and a decision on potentially banning that additive—as was already done in California —is "forthcoming."</p>

<p>The lungs were once at the forefront of SARS-Cov-2 research, but as reports of organ failure and other serious complications poured in, scientists set out to discover how and why the respiratory virus was causing serious damage to the body’s major organs, including the lungs.</p>
<p>An interdisciplinary COVID-19 International Research Team (COV-IRT), which includes UNC School of Medicine’s <a href="https://www.med.unc.edu/pharm/directory/jonathan-c-schisler-phd/">Jonathan C. Schisler, PhD</a>, found that SARS-CoV-2 alters mitochondria on a genetic level, leading to widespread “energy outages” throughout the body and its major organs. Their findings, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/scitranslmed.abq1533">published in</a> <em>Science Translational Medicine,</em> explain how these effects contribute to long COVID symptoms and point to new therapeutic targets.</p>
<p>“We found that at peak infection time, there are distinct changes in different regions of the brain, including is a large decrease in mitochondrial genes in the cerebellum, the part of the brain that controls our muscles, balance, cognition, and emotion” said Schisler, assistant professor of pharmacology and member of the UNC McAllister Heart Institute. “The lung is the primary site of infection, but molecular signals are being transmitted affecting the entire body, with the heart, kidney, and liver being more affected than others, even long after the virus is gone.”</p>
<p>Every cell in our bodies is equipped with biological power stations known as mitochondria, which are especially important for maintaining the function of energy-demanding organs, such as the heart, brain, and lungs. Mitochondria require genes from their own genome (mitochondrial DNA) and nuclear DNA (nDNA) to create energy. Together, they instruct the mitochondria to convert oxygen molecules into cellular energy called adenosine triphosphate (ATP).</p>
<p>Using nasal swabs and autopsy tissues from affected patients and animal models, researchers found that the virus blocks specific genes that use oxygen to create ATP, forcing the body to deplete finite energy reserves in the body. Without an energy source, cells throughout the body begin to starve, with the cells powering the brain and the heart suffering the most.</p>
<p>To keep the body functioning, cardiac and neural cells can resort to consuming their cellular parts, including their mitochondria. Eventually, the cells are deprived of their vital elements and initiate a form of programmed cell death called necroptosis. Unlike other forms of cellular death, necroptosis causes a cascade of ill effects, including a robust inflammatory response, which releases pro-inflammatory cells called cytokines throughout the body as the cells rupture. Uncontrolled necroptosis further enhances sepsis and organ failure.</p>
<p>Schisler says the ensuing cell death and inflammation may explain why patients with long COVID are likely to have persisting cardiovascular, cognitive, and inflammatory side effects after the initial infection has run its course.</p>
<p>“If we can start to appreciate and understand how each organ system adapts in the long-term to viral infection, and if we can discover the biology behind why people respond differently to SARS-CoV-2, we will be better positioned to combat chronic, long COVID symptoms that might be affecting cells in the heart, or the immune cells, or the neurons in our brain,” said Schisler.</p>
<p>Drawing on <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34624208/">past research</a>, the scientists know that a specific microRNA, a small piece of RNA that circulates throughout the body, increases in number during severe respiratory infections. This particular microRNA, which can affect mitochondrial gene expression in numerous cells and tissues, could be a new therapeutic target against SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p>The new findings also highlight new ways to address the mitochondrial dysfunction that occurs during COVID infection. Diet, exercise, natural compounds, or a combination of the three, may be able to stimulate mitochondrial function, but whether or not they are effective for patients with long COVID is yet to be known.</p>
<p>Moving forward, the research team will explore how long mitochondrial dysfunction lasts in the body, especially in cases of long-COVID, and how mitochondrial function can be restored.</p>

            <p>Imagine you are in an interview and you get asked "can you implement bubble sort"...and you answer the interviewer "sure, do you want that in JavaScript or CSS".</p>

<p>What a <strong>flex</strong> would that be?</p>

<p>Now, I know what you are thinking. "no interviewer will be impressed by you creating an animation that <em>simulates</em> bubble sort". And you would be right!</p>

<p>But what if we could create a <strong>functioning</strong> bubble sort algorithm...in pure CSS...and add visualisations to it?</p>

<p>Well, you have come to the right place!</p>

  The Demo

<p><strong>Instructions</strong>: There are 5 values at the top of the <code>:root</code> element:<br>
</p>

<div>
<pre><code><span>:root</span><span>{</span>
    <span>--val1</span><span>:</span> <span>12</span><span>;</span>

    <span>--val4</span><span>:</span> <span>14</span><span>;</span>
    <span>--val5</span><span>:</span> <span>7</span><span>;</span>

<p>These are our unsorted array!</p>

<p>So the above represents: <code>[12,16,9,14,7]</code>.</p>

<p>And you can change those values (any value between 0 and 20) and then press "run" in the Codepen UI and it will actually sort them for you!</p>

<p><strong>warning:</strong> on mobile the last few animations <strong>might not play and just go blank. On PC your fan may spin up!</strong></p>

<p>This is a limitation of using so many calculations that rely on previous calculations...I am not sure if it runs out of memory or what, but I defo pushed the limits of CSS here!</p>

<p>Anyway, with the warnings out of the way, give it a go (you may need to press "rerun" in the bottom right as the animation only plays once)!</p>

<p>Looks complicated, but it isn't, we are performing the following operations:</p>

<ul>
<li>subtract the value of position 2 from the value of position 1 in our array. (lets call this "diff1and2" for ease)</li>
<li>find the maximum of "diff1and2" and 0. We do this as a way of saying "if 1 is bigger than 2, we want a positive value, but if 2 is bigger than 1 we want to return 0". Lets call the result of this "1greaterOrZero".</li>
<li>then we take "OneGreaterOrZero " and make sure it is not greater than 1 by using <code>Min</code>. So if "OneGreaterOrZero" was 6, we would reduce that to 1, but if it was 0 then we would return 0.</li>
</ul>

<p>Still confused? Here it is in JS effectively:<br>
</p>

<div>
<pre><code><span>let</span> <span>pos1</span> <span>=</span> <span>7</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>pos2</span> <span>=</span> <span>15</span><span>;</span>

<span>let</span> <span>diff1and2</span> <span>=</span> <span>pos1</span> <span>-</span> <span>pos2</span><span>;</span> 
<span>//if "diff1and2" is negative the next step will change it to 0;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>OneGreaterOrZero</span> <span>=</span> <span>Math</span><span>.</span><span>max</span><span>(</span><span>diff1and2</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span>

<span>let</span> <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>Math</span><span>.</span><span>min</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>OneGreaterOrZero</span><span>);</span>

  swapping array positions
</h3>

<p>So how do we swap positions in our "array"? </p>

<p>For bubble sort to work we need to be able to swap 2 values if the first value is larger than the second.</p>

<p>We can't do any temp variable magic like we would in JS. </p>

<p>Well, that is what this is for:<br>
</p>

<div>
<pre><code><span>--arr1s1</span><span>:</span> <span>calc</span><span>(</span><span>var</span><span>(</span><span>--is-2-greater-1-step-1</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>var</span><span>(</span><span>--arr1s0</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>var</span><span>(</span><span>--is-1-greater-2-step-1</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>var</span><span>(</span><span>--arr2s0</span><span>));</span>
<span>--arr2s1</span><span>:</span> <span>calc</span><span>(</span><span>var</span><span>(</span><span>--is-1-greater-2-step-1</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>var</span><span>(</span><span>--arr1s0</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>var</span><span>(</span><span>--is-2-greater-1-step-1</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>var</span><span>(</span><span>--arr2s0</span><span>));</span> 
</code></pre>
<div>
<p>
    <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20px" height="20px" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><title>Enter fullscreen mode</title>
    <path d="M16 3h6v6h-2V5h-4V3zM2 3h6v2H4v4H2V3zm18 16v-4h2v6h-6v-2h4zM4 19h4v2H2v-6h2v4z"></path>

</p>
</div>
</div>



<p>Yet again, looks complicated, is actually reasonably simple in principle.</p>

<p>In our previous "function", we created a boolean to see if 1 was greater than 2. So we have either a 1 or a 0 there.</p>

<p>We can also easily get the inverse of this:<br>
</p>

<div>
<pre><code><span>--is-2-greater-1-step-1</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>1</span> <span>-</span> <span>var</span><span>(</span><span>--is-1-greater-2-step-1</span><span>));</span>
</code></pre>
<div>
<p>
    <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20px" height="20px" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><title>Enter fullscreen mode</title>
    <path d="M16 3h6v6h-2V5h-4V3zM2 3h6v2H4v4H2V3zm18 16v-4h2v6h-6v-2h4zM4 19h4v2H2v-6h2v4z"></path>
</svg>

    <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20px" height="20px" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><title>Exit fullscreen mode</title>

</svg>

</p>
</div>
</div>



<p>The beauty of this is that we can now do the following trick:<br>
</p>

<div>
<pre><code>
<span>// in bubble sort, if 1 </span>
<span>origArray</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>7</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>];</span>

<span>// we run our previous functions to get our 2 variables:</span>

<span>oneIsGreater</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span>twoIsGreater</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>

<span>// we can now multiply the values together. If [2] is greater than one then we will return the same value. But if [1] is greater than [2] then we will swap the values.</span>

<span>newArray</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>twoIsGreater</span> <span>*</span> <span>origArray</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>])</span> <span>+</span> <span>(</span><span>oneIsGreater</span> <span>*</span> <span>origArray</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]);</span>

<span>// which is the same as this:</span>

<p>And that is effectively all we need to do a bubble sort!</p>

<p>The only reason we have so much CSS is because we cannot do loops in vanilla CSS (yet). So we have to manually write out the swaps for each stage of bubble sort:</p>

<ul>
<li>check and if needed swap 1 and 2</li>
<li>check and if needed swap 2 and 3</li>
<li>check and if needed swap 3 and 4</li>
<li>check and if needed swap 4 and 5</li>
<li>check and if needed swap 1 and 2</li>
<li>check and if needed swap 2 and 3</li>
<li>check and if needed swap 3 and 4</li>
<li>check and if needed swap 1 and 2</li>
<li>check and if needed swap 2 and 3</li>
<li>check and if needed swap 1 and 2</li>
</ul>

<h2>
  <a name="thats-all-folks" href="#thats-all-folks">
  </a>
  That's all folks!
</h2>

<p>As I said, not a tutorial. But I did want to introduce some interesting CSS "switches" and "booleans" that may become useful in some strange scenario in the future for you!</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy my silliness.</p>

<p>Now I just have to wait for someone to ask me if I can implement Bubble sort so I can flex on them with my CSS silliness! 🤣💗</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><img alt="Microsoft Exchange surrounded by fire" height="800" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/hl-images/2021/03/10/Exchange1.jpg" width="1600"></p>
<p>Microsoft Exchange is impacted by four zero-day vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit remotely to execute arbitrary code or disclose sensitive information on affected installations.</p>
<p>The zero-day vulnerabilities were disclosed by Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) yesterday, who reported them to Microsoft on September 7th and 8th, 2023.</p>
<p>Despite Microsoft acknowledging the reports, its security engineers decided the flaws weren't severe enough to guarantee immediate servicing, postponing the fixes for later.</p>
<p>ZDI disagreed with this response and decided to publish the flaws under its own tracking IDs to warn Exchange admins about the security risks.</p>
<p>A summary of the flaws can be found below:</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-23-1578/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>ZDI-23-1578</strong></a> – A remote code execution (RCE) flaw in the 'ChainedSerializationBinder' class, where user data isn't adequately validated, allowing attackers to deserialize untrusted data. Successful exploitation enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code as 'SYSTEM,' the highest level of privileges on Windows.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-23-1579/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>ZDI-23-1579</strong></a> – Located in the 'DownloadDataFromUri' method, this flaw is due to insufficient validation of a URI before resource access. Attackers can exploit it to access sensitive information from Exchange servers.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-23-1580/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>ZDI-23-1580</strong></a> – This vulnerability, in the 'DownloadDataFromOfficeMarketPlace' method, also stems from improper URI validation, potentially leading to unauthorized information disclosure.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-23-1581/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>ZDI-23-1581</strong></a> – Present in the CreateAttachmentFromUri method, this flaw resembles the previous bugs with inadequate URI validation, again, risking sensitive data exposure.</li>
</ul><p>All these vulnerabilities require authentication for exploitation, which reduces their severity CVSS rating to between 7.1 and 7.5. Furthermore, requiring authentication is a mitigation factor and possibly why Microsoft did not prioritize the fixing of the bugs.</p>
<p>It should be noted, though, that cybercriminals have many ways to obtain Exchange credentials, including brute-forcing weak passwords, performing phishing attacks, purchasing them, or acquiring them from info-stealer logs.</p>
<p>That said, the above zero-days shouldn't be treated as unimportant, especially ZDI-23-1578 (RCE), which can result in complete system compromise.</p>
<p>ZDI suggests that the only salient mitigation strategy is to restrict interaction with Exchange apps. However, this can be unacceptably disruptive for many businesses and organizations using the product.</p>
<p>We also suggest implementing multi-factor authentication to prevent cybercriminals from accessing Exchange instances even when account credentials have been compromised.</p>
<hr><p><em>Update 11/4</em> - A Microsoft spokesperson responded to BleepingComputer's request for a comment with the following statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We appreciate the work of this finder submitting these issues under coordinated vulnerability disclosure, and we’re committed to taking the necessary steps to help protect customers.</p>
<p>We’ve reviewed these reports and have found that they have either already been addressed, or do not meet the bar for immediate servicing under our <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/olsbugbar" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">severity classification guidelines</a> and we will evaluate addressing them in future product versions and updates as appropriate.&nbsp;- a Microsoft spokesperson&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Further Microsoft provided&nbsp;the below additional context on each of the discovered flaws: &nbsp;</p>
<ul><li>Regarding ZDI-23-1578: Customers who have applied the August Security Updates are already protected.</li>
<li>Regarding ZDI-23-1581: The technique described requires an attacker to have prior access to email credentials, and no evidence was presented that it can be leveraged to gain elevation of privilege.</li>
<li>Regarding ZDI-23-1579: The technique described requires an attacker to have prior access to email credentials.</li>
<li>Regarding ZDI-23-1580: The technique described requires an attacker to have prior access to email credentials, and no evidence was presented that it can be leveraged to access sensitive customer information.</li>
</ul>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p><span>A few weeks</span> ago, a friend of mine found out that a childhood classmate had died unexpectedly. They hadn’t stayed in touch, but he was sad and curious about what had happened, so he did what people do when they hear that someone they know has passed away: Googled her obituary. What he found was odd—so much so that he texted to ask if I’d ever heard of such a thing. Along with pages hosting her official obit, he saw 10 separate YouTube videos of different people casually reciting information about her death.</p><p>He’s now part of a group united by an unsettling but increasingly commonplace experience. People who lose somebody, whether it’s a dearly cherished family member or a long-lost acquaintance, must now navigate a slimy cottage industry of profiteers trying to hijack their attention. Instead of finding important funeral details or where to write a remembrance or send flowers, they are confronted by a flood of low-budget videos crudely summarizing the death notices of the person they’ve lost.</p><p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/morbid-war-online-obituaries/">Obituary pirating</a>, where people scrape and republish obituaries from funeral homes and websites like Legacy.com, has been an ethically dubious business for years. Piracy websites are often skilled enough at search engine optimization to rise to the top of search results, and they use the resulting traffic to charge a premium for digital ads that appear next to text lifted wholesale from funeral homes, local newspapers, and other authorized obituary publishers. Occasionally, these pirate sites go a step further, manipulating bereaved people into <a data-offer-url="https://thebao.ca/notice-to-the-consumer-beware-of-online-obituary-piracy/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://thebao.ca/notice-to-the-consumer-beware-of-online-obituary-piracy/&quot;}" href="https://thebao.ca/notice-to-the-consumer-beware-of-online-obituary-piracy/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">buying sympathy gifts</a> like candles or flowers and pocketing the money.</p><p>The flood of YouTube obituary videos is a janky update on this practice. Some of these channels upload dozens of death notice summaries every hour, abandoning any pretense of looking like an official source of information in an effort to churn out as many videos as they can.</p><p><span>Although text-based obituary</span> pirating has been a scourge on the industry for years, these videos are a <a data-offer-url="https://www.marketingbrew.com/stories/2023/04/25/why-are-people-reading-obituaries-on-youtube" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.marketingbrew.com/stories/2023/04/25/why-are-people-reading-obituaries-on-youtube&quot;}" href="https://www.marketingbrew.com/stories/2023/04/25/why-are-people-reading-obituaries-on-youtube" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">more recent phenomenon</a>. “This is a new one for me,” says Jessica Koth, director of public relations for the National Funeral Directors Association. “These videos are not sanctioned or authorized by the funeral home or family of the person who died. I would imagine they would be quite upsetting to the families involved.”</p><p>Unhappy posts about the practice abound on Reddit, where for the past few years people have complained about how tasteless it is and wondered why it is happening and whether they can do anything to stop it. “These people are monetizing our loved ones’ deaths,” says one such message.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>“It’s predatory toward people who are heavily grieving,” says another. “If there’s nothing that can be done about this, that’s extremely sad.”</p><p>The more prolific channels upload new videos every few minutes. Many look nearly identical and feature men sitting alone and speaking directly to the camera. They often appear to be lounging at home. (It’s hard to verify exactly where they are; I reached out to the proprietors of several accounts, but none responded.) Others narrate obituaries over corny slideshows of candles and photos of the deceased sourced from social media. Their subscriber numbers are modest, making it all even more puzzling; on the higher end, channels will have a few thousand subscribers and millions of overall views. The highest follower count I found was slightly over 26,000; the page with the highest views had a grand total of around 1.7 million.</p><p>Sometimes these obituary YouTubers promote products in the video description, like a $225 vitamin C cream for sale on Amazon. Sometimes they just list strings of SEO-baiting keywords, like “death,” “cause of death,” “die,” “RIP,” and “what happened.” While each channel differs from the next in small ways, there’s a unifying aesthetic—everything looks rushed and careless, and there’s no hint of emotion or acknowledgement that they’re discussing someone’s greatest tragedy.</p><p>“The audio is crappy, they’ve got fans on,” funeral marketing consultant Robin Heppell says. “It’s not professionally done.”</p><p>That’s because the business model focuses on quantity over quality. Many of the videos have no views at all; when they do, they rarely crack double digits. The success or failure of individual videos isn’t important, as long as they accumulate enough views in the aggregate.</p><p>Despite their shoddiness, the obituary YouTube channels <em>are</em> sometimes amassing enough followers and views to meet YouTube’s Partner Program requirements and start making money off advertisements. (YouTube did not respond to requests for comment.)</p><p>Some of these YouTubers openly describe their projects as money-making ventures, like Quoddos Taunsvi, a Pakistan-based vlogger who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@quddostaunsvi2300/about">brags</a> that following his videos will bring riches: “surely you will earn thounsands $ [sic] per month.” Others make glancing attempts to defend what they do. One channel includes a disclaimer about how its videos are protected by the fair use doctrine. According to intellectual property lawyer Bhamati Viswanathan, this is likely true. “Bummer for the families, but I don’t see what they could do other than appeal to the creators on grounds of taste, sensitivity, basic kindness,” she says.</p><p>The obituary pirates aren’t the only group explicitly trying to ramp up engagement on death-announcement content. <em>Editor &amp; Publisher</em> magazine, for example, hosted a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2ogAXtuKoM">webinar</a> last year called “Optimizing obituaries to drive traffic and increase revenue.” Newspapers take out <a data-offer-url="https://ipublishmedia.com/biggest-surprise-targeted-obits-facebook-love/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://ipublishmedia.com/biggest-surprise-targeted-obits-facebook-love/&quot;}" href="https://ipublishmedia.com/biggest-surprise-targeted-obits-facebook-love/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">targeted ads</a> on Facebook specifically to draw more eyes to obituaries. But if local papers presumably have the community’s interests in mind when they share death notices, those reading obits on YouTube seem to be in it solely for the clicks.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>While some YouTubers exclusively post obituary content, others intersperse obituary readings with summaries of other news. One of these channels, Event Click, recently posted photos of an orangutan throwing a possum from its enclosure in Australia’s Perth Zoo. “I would presume it did not survive the fall,” says a robotic voice narrating the video. Before I could watch that video, I had to watch an ad from Etsy. (WIRED reached out to several companies whose ads appeared before obituary videos for comment, including BetterHelp, 1-800-Flowers, and Etsy. As of this writing, none have responded.)</p><p>Anjali Bal, a marketing professor at Babson College in Massachusetts, finds these videos “morbid and weird” and views the business strategy as ultimately short-sighted. They play on a surge of interest in keywords related to recent deaths, pumping out low-effort content in an attempt to capitalize on this temporary flow of web traffic. “In the short term it boosts the page,” she says. “In the long term these things are uncomfortable for the consumer and will not lead to long-term engagement.”</p><p><span>This genre, while</span> bizarre, does have analogs, albeit ones that seem far more aligned with the public interest. Short-form video is an increasingly central source of news, including videos that repackage original reporting from elsewhere for viewers with shorter attention spans. This isn’t always a bad thing; a TikToker named Kelsey Russell, for instance, has gained an audience by <a data-offer-url="https://embedded.substack.com/p/gen-z-loves-the-newspaper-on-tiktok" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://embedded.substack.com/p/gen-z-loves-the-newspaper-on-tiktok&quot;}" href="https://embedded.substack.com/p/gen-z-loves-the-newspaper-on-tiktok" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">recapping</a> &nbsp;pieces from <em>The New York Times</em> for a younger generation. While the YouTube obituary videos lack Russell’s panache or thoughtfulness, the most generous reading is that they too recap information that audiences are seeking out in an easily-digestible form.</p><p>The rise of this type of video is also directly connected to a broad and enduring cultural fascination with mortality. Obituaries are big business because people are captivated by death; this is one reason serial-killer content has turned into such a reliably popular genre. “Reading obituaries seems like a budget version of the true crime format,” says Josh Cohen, founder of the creator-economy news website TubeFilter. As Cohen points out, YouTube is filled with people copying what works. “There’s tons of knockoffs,” he says.</p><p>In the past, obituary pirates have <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/afterlife-obituary-class-action-lawsuit-1.5119601">been punished</a> for their misdeeds. In 2019, for example, a Canadian website called Afterlife that scraped and republished obituaries was ordered to pay $20 million (CDN) in restitution to grieving families. In that case, the class action plaintiffs successfully argued that lifting the obituaries and accompanying photos they’d put online to honor their loved ones was copyright infringement. But in more recent examples, the YouTuber obituary pirates tend to summarize information they’ve found online, rather than repeating it verbatim. While distasteful, it’s not illegal to callously recount the details of other people’s misfortune. (If it were, several prominent true-crime podcasters would certainly be in jail.)</p><p>It seems unlikely that this trend will die down as long as there’s money to be made, even if it’s a modest sum—and the rise of AI tools may make the situation even more infuriating. Last week, Microsoft’s MSN news site was roundly castigated for an incoherent and <a data-offer-url="https://searchengineland.com/microsoft-brandon-hunter-useless-ai-obituary-432008" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://searchengineland.com/microsoft-brandon-hunter-useless-ai-obituary-432008&quot;}" href="https://searchengineland.com/microsoft-brandon-hunter-useless-ai-obituary-432008" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">oddly hostile</a> obituary for former NBA player Brandon Hunter; critics assumed the garbled article was written by AI, as the company had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/30/microsoft-sacks-journalists-to-replace-them-with-robots">laid off</a> human staffers in favor of algorithmically generated content three years earlier. (Microsoft never confirmed whether the offending story was AI-generated, but it was removed nonetheless.)</p><p>My friend’s experience struck him as strange and crass enough to ask a tech reporter—me—if I’d ever heard of it. But what is viewed as creepy now may look quaint in the future. Considering how the obituary pirates on YouTube prioritize speed and volume above coherence and dignity, it’d be more surprising if they didn’t embrace artificial intelligence in their quest to profit off curiosity and heartache.</p></div></div></div>]]></description>
