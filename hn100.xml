<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p><span>Five years ago, we announced to the world that we were building AR glasses. We don’t think people should have to make the choice between a world of information at your fingertips and being present in the physical world around you.</span></p>
<p><span>That’s why today, we’re unveiling </span><a href="https://about.meta.com/realitylabs/orion"><span>Orion</span></a><span>, which we believe is the most advanced pair of AR glasses ever made. Orion bridges the physical and virtual worlds, putting people at the center so they can be more present, connected and empowered in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>There are three primary reasons why AR glasses are key to unlocking the next great leap in human-oriented computing.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>They enable digital experiences that are unconstrained by the limits of a smartphone screen. With large holographic displays, you can use the physical world as your canvas, placing 2D and 3D content and experiences anywhere you want.</span></li>
<li><span>They seamlessly integrate contextual AI that can sense and understand the world around you in order to anticipate and proactively address your needs.</span></li>
<li><span>They’re lightweight and great for both indoor and outdoor use, and they let people see each other’s face, eyes and expressions.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>This slideshow requires JavaScript.</p>
<p><span>That’s the north star our industry has been building towards: a product combining the convenience and immediacy of wearables with a large display, high-bandwidth input and contextualized AI in a form that people feel comfortable wearing in their daily lives.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2>The Evolution of Smart Glasses</h2>
<p><span>Ray-Ban Meta glasses have demonstrated the power of giving people hands-free access to key parts of their digital lives from their physical ones. We can talk to a smart AI assistant, connect with friends and capture the moments that matter – all without ever having to pull out a phone.</span></p>
<p><span>Yet while Ray-Ban Meta opened up an entirely new category of display-less glasses super-charged by AI, the XR industry has long dreamt of true AR glasses – a product that combines the benefits of a large holographic display and personalized AI assistance in a comfortable, all-day wearable form factor. Orion rises to the challenge.</span></p>
<h2>Groundbreaking AR Display in an Unparalleled Form</h2>
<p><span>We’ve been hard at work for years to take the incredible spatial experiences afforded by VR and MR headsets and miniaturize the technology necessary to deliver those experiences in a pair of lightweight, stylish glasses.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Nailing the form factor, delivering holographic displays, developing compelling AR experiences, creating new human-computer interaction (HCI) paradigms – and doing it all in one cohesive product – is one of the most difficult challenges our industry has ever faced. It was so challenging that we thought we had less than a 10% chance of pulling it off successfully. Until now.</span></p>
<p><span>Orion is a feat of miniaturization – t</span><span>he components are packed down to a fraction of a millimeter.</span><span> Dozens of innovations were required to get the design down to a contemporary form that you’d be comfortable wearing every day.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Orion has the largest field of view in the smallest AR glasses form to date. That field of view unlocks truly immersive use cases for Orion, from multitasking windows and big-screen entertainment to life-size holograms of people – all digital content that can seamlessly blend with your view of the physical world.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/03_multiscreens.gif?resize=960%2C836"><img src="https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/03_multiscreens.gif?resize=960%2C836" alt="Video from the POV of someone looking at multiple holographic screens" width="960" height="836" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p><span>But what makes Orion unique is that it is unmistakably a pair of glasses in both look and feel – complete with transparent lenses. Unlike MR headsets or other AR glasses today, you can still see other people’s eyes and expressions, so you can be present and share the experience with the people around you.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2>Augmented Reality Experiences</h2>
<p><span>Of course, as with any piece of hardware, Orion is only as good as the things you can do with it. And while it’s still early days, the experiences afforded by Orion are an exciting glimpse of what’s to come.</span></p>
<p><span>We’ve got our smart assistant, </span><a href="https://www.meta.ai/"><span>Meta AI</span></a><span>, running on Orion. It understands what you’re looking at in the physical world and can help you with useful visualizations. So you can open up your refrigerator and ask for a recipe based on what’s inside. Or video call a friend while adjusting a digital family calendar as you wash the dishes.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/04_recipes.gif?resize=960%2C836"><img loading="lazy" src="https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/04_recipes.gif?resize=960%2C836" alt="Video of ingredients with a recipe on a holographic screen next to it" width="960" height="836" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p><span>You can take a hands-free video call to catch up with friends and family in real time, and you can stay connected on WhatsApp and Messenger to view and send messages. No need to pull out your phone, unlock it, find the right app and let your friend know you’re running late for dinner – you can do it all through your glasses.</span></p>
<p><span>Our teams continue to iterate on the experiences available through Orion today to build new immersive social experiences, and we can’t wait to share what’s next.</span></p>
<h2>A Purposeful Product Prototype</h2>
<p><span>While Orion won’t make its way into the hands of consumers, make no mistake: this is not a research prototype. It’s one of the most polished product prototypes we’ve ever developed, and is truly representative of something that could ship to consumers. Rather than rushing to put it on shelves, we decided to focus on internal development first, which means we can keep building quickly and continue to push the boundaries of the technology, helping us arrive at an even better consumer product faster.</span></p>

<h2>What Comes Next</h2>
<p><span>Beginning today at Connect and continuing throughout the year, we’re opening up access to our Orion product prototype for Meta employees and select external audiences so our development team can learn, iterate and build towards our consumer AR glasses product line, which we plan to begin shipping in the near future.</span></p>
<p><span>And now that we’ve shared Orion with the world, we’re focused on a few things:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Tuning the AR display quality to make the visuals even sharper</span></li>
<li><span>Optimizing wherever we can to make the form factor even smaller</span></li>
<li><span>Building at scale to make them more affordable</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>In the next few years, you can expect to see new devices from us that build on our R&amp;D efforts. Orion isn’t just a window into the future – it’s a look at the very real possibilities within reach today. From Ray-Ban Meta glasses to Orion, we’ve seen the good that can come from letting people stay more present and empowered in the physical world, while tapping into all that the digital world has to offer.</span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>We’ve been excited by the <a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/llama-usage-doubled-may-through-july-2024/" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><u>impact the Llama 3.1 herd of models have made</u></a> in the two months since we announced them, including the <a href="https://www.meta.ai/?utm_source=llama_meta_site&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_content=Llama_nav&amp;utm_campaign=July_moment" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><u>405B</u></a>—the first open frontier-level AI model. While these models are incredibly powerful, we recognize that building with them requires significant compute resources and expertise. We’ve also heard from developers who don’t have access to these resources and still want the opportunity to build with Llama. As Meta Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg shared today at Connect, they won’t have to wait any longer. Today, we’re releasing Llama 3.2, which includes small and medium-sized vision LLMs (11B and 90B) and lightweight, text-only models (1B and 3B) that fit onto select edge and mobile devices.</p><p>It’s only been a year and a half since we first announced Llama, and we’ve made incredible progress in such a short amount of time. This year, <a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/llama-usage-doubled-may-through-july-2024/" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><u>Llama has achieved 10x growth</u></a> and become the standard for responsible innovation. Llama also continues to lead on openness, modifiability, and cost efficiency, and it’s competitive with closed models—even leading in some areas. We believe that openness drives innovation and is the right path forward, which is why we continue to share our research and collaborate with our partners and the developer community.</p><p>We’re making Llama 3.2 models available for download on <a href="https://llama.meta.com/" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><u>llama.com</u></a> and <a href="https://huggingface.co/meta-llama" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><u>Hugging Face</u></a>, as well as available for immediate development on our broad ecosystem of partner platforms. Partners are an important part of this work, and we’ve worked with over 25 companies, including AMD, AWS, Databricks, Dell, Google Cloud, Groq, IBM, Intel, Microsoft Azure, NVIDIA, Oracle Cloud, and Snowflake, to enable services on day one. For the Llama 3.2 release, we’re also working with on-device partners Arm, MediaTek, and Qualcomm to offer a broad range of services at launch. Starting today, we’re also making <a href="https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-stack" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><u>Llama Stack</u></a> available to the community. More details on the latest release, including information on the <a href="https://euneedsai.com/" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><u>multimodal availability</u></a> in Europe, can be found in <a href="https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-models/blob/main/models/llama3_2/USE_POLICY.md" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><u>our acceptable use policy</u></a>.</p></div><p>Meet Llama 3.2</p></div><div><div><p>The two largest models of the Llama 3.2 collection, 11B and 90B, support image reasoning use cases, such as document-level understanding including charts and graphs, captioning of images, and visual grounding tasks such as directionally pinpointing objects in images based on natural language descriptions. For example, a person could ask a question about which month in the previous year their small business had the best sales, and Llama 3.2 can then reason based on an available graph and quickly provide the answer. In another example, the model could reason with a map and help answer questions such as when a hike might become steeper or the distance of a particular trail marked on the map. The 11B and 90B models can also bridge the gap between vision and language by extracting details from an image, understanding the scene, and then crafting a sentence or two that could be used as an image caption to help tell the story.</p><p>The lightweight 1B and 3B models are highly capable with multilingual text generation and tool calling abilities. These models empower developers to build personalized, on-device agentic applications with strong privacy where data never leaves the device. For example, such an application could help summarize the last 10 messages received, extract action items, and leverage tool calling to directly send calendar invites for follow-up meetings.</p><p>Running these models locally comes with two major advantages. First, prompts and responses can feel instantaneous, since processing is done locally. Second, running models locally maintains privacy by not sending data such as messages and calendar information to the cloud, making the overall application more private. Since processing is handled locally, the application can clearly control which queries stay on the device and which may need to be processed by a larger model in the cloud.</p></div><p>Model evaluations</p><div><p>Our evaluation suggests that the Llama 3.2 vision models are competitive with leading foundation models, Claude 3 Haiku and GPT4o-mini on image recognition and a range of visual understanding tasks. The 3B model outperforms the Gemma 2 2.6B and Phi 3.5-mini models on tasks such as following instructions, summarization, prompt rewriting, and tool-use, while the 1B is competitive with Gemma.</p><p>We evaluated performance on over 150 benchmark datasets that span a wide range of languages. For the vision LLMs, we evaluated performance on benchmarks for image understanding and visual reasoning.</p><br></div><p><img src="https://scontent.fzrh3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/461288018_1255239495501495_271827633811450582_n.png?_nc_cat=102&amp;ccb=1-7&amp;_nc_sid=e280be&amp;_nc_ohc=oeAoi7_K9ggQ7kNvgE8Zpdb&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fzrh3-1.fna&amp;_nc_gid=ADyiZ_xNTdS_fAeqWnELSPZ&amp;oh=00_AYDMbCATap9ZGIWGhs6IVu17rVzyVC_Le8VgxoFJIFee1w&amp;oe=670EE46D" alt="" id="u_0_4_2L"></p><p><img src="https://scontent.fzrh3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/461157789_931406385491961_1692349435372036848_n.png?_nc_cat=100&amp;ccb=1-7&amp;_nc_sid=e280be&amp;_nc_ohc=cgqzw-5Xp68Q7kNvgH3D7-A&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fzrh3-1.fna&amp;_nc_gid=ADyiZ_xNTdS_fAeqWnELSPZ&amp;oh=00_AYAtWvlCUwgtC2Tnoa7QT0N1wrgXCaXa_3Qylh6SV2gKzA&amp;oe=670EC398" alt="" id="u_0_5_Mg"></p><p>Vision models</p><div><p>As the first Llama models to support vision tasks, the 11B and 90B models required an entirely new model architecture that supports image reasoning.</p><p>To add image input support, we trained a set of adapter weights that integrate the pre-trained image encoder into the pre-trained language model. The adapter consists of a series of cross-attention layers that feed image encoder representations into the language model. We trained the adapter on text-image pairs to align the image representations with the language representations. During adapter training, we also updated the parameters of the image encoder, but intentionally did not update the language-model parameters. By doing that, we keep all the text-only capabilities intact, providing developers a drop-in replacement for Llama 3.1 models.</p><p>Our training pipeline consists of multiple stages, starting from pretrained Llama 3.1 text models. First, we add image adapters and encoders, then pretrain on large-scale noisy (image, text) pair data. Next, we train on medium-scale high quality in-domain and knowledge-enhanced (image, text) pair data.</p><p>In post-training, we use a similar recipe as the text models by doing several rounds of alignment on supervised fine-tuning, rejection sampling, and direct preference optimization. We leverage synthetic data generation by using the Llama 3.1 model to filter and augment question and answers on top of in-domain images, and use a reward model to rank all the candidate answers to provide high quality fine-tuning data. We also add safety mitigation data to produce a model with a high level of safety while retaining helpfulness of the mode</p><p>The end result is a set of models that can take in both image and text prompts, and deeply understand and reason on the combination. This is another step toward Llama models having even richer agentic capabilities.</p><br></div><p>Lightweight models</p><div><p>As we talked about with Llama 3.1, powerful teacher models can be leveraged to create smaller models that have improved performance. We used two methods—pruning and distillation—on the 1B and 3B models, making them the first highly capable lightweight Llama models that can fit on devices efficiently.</p><p>Pruning enabled us to reduce the size of extant models in the Llama herd while recovering as much knowledge and performance as possible. For the 1B and 3B models, we took the approach of using structured pruning in a single shot manner from the Llama 3.1 8B. This involved systematically removing parts of the network and adjusting the magnitude of the weights and gradients to create a smaller, more efficient model that retains the performance of the original network.</p><p>Knowledge distillation uses a larger network to impart knowledge on a smaller network, with the idea that a smaller model can achieve better performance using a teacher than it could from scratch. For the 1B and 3B in Llama 3.2, we incorporated logits from the Llama 3.1 8B and 70B models into the pre-training stage of the model development, where outputs (logits) from these larger models were used as token-level targets. Knowledge distillation was used after pruning to recover performance.</p><br></div><p><img src="https://scontent.fzrh3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/461209081_511117684875670_45564063096782202_n.png?_nc_cat=101&amp;ccb=1-7&amp;_nc_sid=e280be&amp;_nc_ohc=ieNr4u425SwQ7kNvgGrbiWa&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fzrh3-1.fna&amp;_nc_gid=ADyiZ_xNTdS_fAeqWnELSPZ&amp;oh=00_AYDsxVu1KvPuqspn62ZVregQPBGZXtIPMO9ExVdzqB4gxw&amp;oe=670EE3DE" alt="" id="u_0_9_Gn"></p><div><p>In post-training, we use a similar recipe as Llama 3.1 and produce final chat models by doing several rounds of alignment on top of the pre-trained model. Each round involves supervised fine-tuning (SFT), rejection sampling (RS), and direct preference optimization (DPO).</p><p>In post-training, we scale context length support to 128K tokens, while maintaining the same quality as the pre-trained model. We also engage in synthetic data generation that goes through careful data processing and filtering to ensure high quality. We carefully blend the data to optimize for high quality across multiple capabilities like summarization, rewriting, instruction following, language reasoning, and tool use.</p><p>To enable the community to innovate on these models, we worked closely with Qualcomm and Mediatek, the top two mobile system on a chip (SoC) companies in the world, and Arm, who provides the foundational compute platform for <a href="https://www.arm.com/company" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie"><u>99</u></a><a href="https://www.arm.com/company" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie">%</a> of mobile devices. The weights being released today are based on BFloat16 numerics.

The engagement has been great.</p><p>Since then, we have been working hard to make the API real. We built a reference implementation of the APIs for inference, tool use, and RAG. In addition, we have been working with partners to adapt them to become providers for the APIs. Finally, we have introduced Llama Stack Distribution as a way to package multiple API Providers that work well together to provide a single endpoint for developers. We are now sharing with the community a simplified and consistent experience that will enable them to work with Llama models in multiple environments, including on-prem, cloud, single-node, and on-device.</p><br></div><p><img src="https://scontent.fzrh3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/460924239_3402957093334534_4357083070437107157_n.png?_nc_cat=109&amp;ccb=1-7&amp;_nc_sid=e280be&amp;_nc_ohc=zKTWaIWC3AIQ7kNvgH8H9c8&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fzrh3-1.fna&amp;_nc_gid=ADyiZ_xNTdS_fAeqWnELSPZ&amp;oh=00_AYCvn28-wNqLSj9fc0cz1oxYweRRaHRS6smL3no1_ill3Q&amp;oe=670EC620" alt="" id="u_0_j_Ys"></p><div><div><p>The full set of releases includes:</p><ol><li>Llama CLI (command line interface) to build, configure, and run Llama Stack distributions</li><li>Client code in multiple languages, including python, node, kotlin, and swift</li><li>Docker containers for Llama Stack Distribution Server and Agents API Provider</li><li>Multiple distributions<ol><li>Single-node Llama Stack Distribution via Meta internal implementation and Ollama</li><li>Cloud Llama Stack distributions via AWS, Databricks, Fireworks, and Together</li><li>On-device Llama Stack Distribution on iOS implemented via PyTorch ExecuTorch</li><li>On-prem Llama Stack Distribution supported by Dell</li></ol></li></ol><p>We look forward to working with developers and partners to simplify all aspects of building with Llama models and welcome feedback.</p><br></div><p><img src="https://scontent.fzrh3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/460942153_931942502081982_4461283719059292584_n.png?_nc_cat=108&amp;ccb=1-7&amp;_nc_sid=e280be&amp;_nc_ohc=yPZiTRUpQyIQ7kNvgGmAxck&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fzrh3-1.fna&amp;_nc_gid=ADyiZ_xNTdS_fAeqWnELSPZ&amp;oh=00_AYAln3XFhMf0mccyDv_zyuK2uKI2xqDCVc1PiKB__kZ7jQ&amp;oe=670ED455" alt="" id="u_0_k_yb"></p><div><p>System level safety</p><div><p>Taking an open approach has many benefits.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
												<p>The FBI is warning timeshare owners to be wary of a prevalent telemarketing scam involving a violent Mexican drug cartel that tries to trick people into believing someone wants to buy their property. This is the story of a couple who recently lost more than $50,000 to an ongoing timeshare scam that spans at least two dozen phony escrow, title and realty firms.</p>
<div id="attachment_68950"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-68950" decoding="async" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/realestateassets-llc.png" alt="" width="751" height="405" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/realestateassets-llc.png 2330w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/realestateassets-llc-768x414.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/realestateassets-llc-1536x828.png 1536w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/realestateassets-llc-2048x1104.png 2048w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/realestateassets-llc-782x422.png 782w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/realestateassets-llc-370x200.png 370w" sizes="(max-width: 751px) 100vw, 751px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-68950">One of the phony real estate companies trying to scam people out of money over fake offers to buy their timeshares.</p></div>
<p>One evening in late 2022, someone phoned <strong>Mr. &amp; Mrs. Dimitruk</strong>, a retired couple from Ontario, Canada and asked whether they’d ever considered selling their timeshare in Florida. The person on the phone referenced their timeshare address and said they had an interested buyer in Mexico. Would they possibly be interested in selling it?</p>
<p>The Dimitruks had purchased the timeshare years ago, but it wasn’t fully paid off — they still owed roughly $5,000 before they could legally sell it. That wouldn’t be an issue for this buyer, the man on the phone assured them.</p>
<p>With a few days, their contact at a escrow company in New York called <strong>ecurrencyescrow[.]llc</strong> faxed them forms to fill out and send back to start the process of selling their timeshare to the potential buyer, who had offered an amount that was above what the property was likely worth.</p>
<p>After certain forms were signed and faxed, the Dimitruks were asked to send a small wire transfer of more than $3,000 to handle “administrative” and “processing” fees, supposedly so that the sale would not be held up by any bureaucratic red tape down in Mexico.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ecurrencyesc.png" alt="" width="749" height="751" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ecurrencyesc.png 1410w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ecurrencyesc-768x770.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ecurrencyesc-782x784.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px"></p>
<p>These document exchanges went on for almost a year, during which time the real estate brokers made additional financial demands, such as tax payments on the sale, and various administrative fees. Mrs. Dimitruk even sent them a $5,000 wire to pay off her remaining balance on the timeshare they thought they were selling.</p>
<p>In a phone interview with KrebsOnSecurity, Mr. Dimitruk said they lost over $50,000.</p>
<p>“They kept calling me after that saying, ‘Hey your money is waiting for you here’,” said <strong>William Dimitruk</strong>, a 73-year-old retired long-haul truck driver. “They said ‘We’re going to get in trouble if the money isn’t returned to you,’ and gave me a toll-free number to call them at.”</p>
<p>In the last call he had with the scammers, the man on the other end of the line confessed that some bad people had worked for them previously, but that those employees had been fired.</p>
<p>“Near the end of the call he said, ‘You’ve been dealing with some bad people and we fired all those bad guys,'” Dimitruk recalled. “So they were like, yeah it’s all good. You can go ahead and pay us more and we’ll send you your money.”</p>
<p>According to the FBI, there are indeed some very bad people behind these scams. The FBI warns the timeshare fraud schemes have been linked to the <strong>Jalisco New Generation drug cartel</strong> in Mexico.</p>
<p>In July 2024, the FBI and the Treasury Department’s <strong>Financial Crimes Enforcement Network</strong> (FinCEN) <a href="https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/fincen-ofac-and-fbi-joint-notice-timeshare-fraud-associated-mexico-based" target="_blank" rel="noopener">warned</a> the Jalisco cartel is running boiler room-like call centers that target people who own timeshares:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Mexico-based [transnational criminal organizations] such as the Jalisco New Generation Cartel are increasingly targeting U.S. owners of timeshares in Mexico through complex and often yearslong telemarketing, impersonation, and advance fee schemes. They use the illicit proceeds to diversify their revenue streams and finance other criminal activities, including the manufacturing and trafficking of illicit fentanyl and other synthetic drugs into the United States.”</p></blockquote>
<p>A <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-sanctions-cartel-accountants-timeshare-scams-target-americans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 2024 CBS News story</a> about these scams notes that U.S. and Mexican officials last year confirmed that as many as eight young workers were confirmed dead after they apparently tried to quit jobs at a call center operated by the Jalisco cartel.</p>

<p>The phony escrow company the Dimitruks dealt with — <strong>ecurrencyescrow[.]llc</strong> — is no longer online. But the documents sent by their contact there referenced a few other still-active domains, including <strong>realestateassetsllc[.]com</strong></p>
<p>The original registration records of both of these domains reference another domain — <strong>datasur[.]host</strong> — that is associated with dozens of other real estate and escrow-themed domains going back at least four years. Some of these domains are no longer active, while others have been previously suspended at different hosting providers. <span id="more-68943"></span></p>

<p>By loading ecurrencyescrowllc[.]com into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230214194256/http://ecurrencyescrow.llc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Wayback Machine at archive.org</a>, we can see text at the top of the page that reads, “Visit our resource library for videos and tools designed to make managing your escrow disbursements a breeze.”</p>
<p>Searching on that bit of text at <a href="https://publicwww.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">publicwww.com</a> shows the same text appears on the website of an escrow company called <strong>Escshieldsecurity Network</strong> (escshieldsecurity[.]com). This entity claims to have been around since 2009, but the domain itself is less than two years old, and there is no contact information associated with the site. The Pennsylvania Secretary of State also has no record of a business by this name at its stated address.</p>
<p>Incredibly, Escshieldsecurity pitches itself as a solution to timeshare closing scams.</p>
<p>“By 2015, cyber thieves had realized the amount of funds involved and had targeted the real estate, title and settlement industry,” the company’s website states. “As funding became more complex and risky, agents and underwriters had little time or resources to keep up. The industry needed a simple solution that allowed it to keep pace with new funding security needs.”</p>
<p>The domains associated with this scam will often reference legitimate companies and licensed professionals in the real estate and closing businesses, but those real professionals often have no idea they’re being impersonated until someone starts asking around. The truth is, the original reader tip that caused KrebsOnSecurity to investigate this scheme came from one such professional whose name and reputation was being used to scam others.</p>
<p>It is unclear whether the Dimitruks were robbed by people working for the Jalisco cartel, but it is clear that whoever is responsible for managing many of the above-mentioned domains — including the DNS provider datasur[.]host — recently compromised their computer with information-stealing malware.</p>
<p>That’s according to data collected by the breach tracking service <a href="https://www.constella.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Constella Intelligence</a> [Constella is currently an advertiser on KrebsOnSecurity]. Constella found that someone using the email address exposed in the DNS records for datasur[.]host — jyanes1920@gmail.com — also was relieved of credentials for managing most of the domains referenced above at a Mexican hosting provider.</p>
<p>It’s not unusual for victims of such scams to keep mum about their misfortune. Sometimes, it’s shame and embarrassment that prevents victims from filing a report with the local authorities. But in this case, victims who learn they’ve been robbed by a violent drug cartel have even more reason to remain silent.</p>
<p>William Dimitruk acknowledged that he and his wife haven’t yet filed a police report. But after acknowledging it could help prevent harm to other would-be victims, Mr. Dimitruk said he would consider it.</p>
<p>There is another reason victims of scams like this should notify authorities: Occasionally, the feds will bust up one of these scam operations and seize funds that were stolen from victims. But those investigations can take years, and it can be even more years before the government starts trying to figure out who got scammed and how to remunerate victims. All too often, the real impediment to returning some of those losses is that the feds have no idea who the victims are.</p>
<p>If you are the victim of a timeshare scam like this, please consider filing a report with the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), at <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ic3.gov</a>. Other places where victims may wish to file a complaint:</p>

Audio masking, or just <i>masking</i>, is a technique that is often used with
<a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/covert/bugs/index.htm"><span data-balloon-pos="up" aria-label="More about: covert listening devices">covert listening devices</span></a>,
or <a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/covert/bugs/index.htm"><span data-balloon-pos="up" aria-label="More about: ..."><i>bugs</i></span></a>, for hiding the intelligence of
the intercepted audio (e.g. human speech), from a casual or professional
interceptor.
In some cases, obscure modulation techniques are used that defeat any
non-compatible surveillance receiver.
Some of these masking schemes are described below.
<p>

The following audio masking techniques are currently covered:

          </p>
<br>        <p>
          <span size="-1" face="Lucida Grande,Arial,Verdana,sans-serif" color="#555555">

            </li><li><a href="#tp">Triple Pulse (TP)</a><br>
            </li><li><a href="#rp">Rejected Pulse (RP)</a><br>
            </li><li><a href="#dp">Dirty Pulse (DP)</a><br>
            </li><li><a href="#sp">Super Pulse (SP)</a><br>
          </li></ul>
        </span></p>
        <a name="sc"></a>
        
        <p>
          <span size="-1" face="Lucida Grande,Arial,Verdana,sans-serif" color="#555555">
One of the first and most widespread techniques is the use of subcarrier modulation.
It works on the basis that the audible audio signal is modulated onto another
audio signal that is well above the audible range. The combined signal is then
modulated onto an <span data-balloon-pos="up" aria-label="Radio Frequency">RF</span> carrier. In its basic form, an interceptor will only hear
a silent carrier once the <span data-balloon-pos="up" aria-label="Radio Frequency">RF</span> signal has been demodulated. The actual audio
modulation can only be recovered by demodulating the demodulated signal once more.
<table><tbody><tr><td>
            <div>
            <p><img src="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/covert/bugs/masking/svg/sc_mod.svg">
            </p>
            </div></td></tr><tr><td>
          </td></tr></tbody></table>
<br>
With this scheme, Frequency Modulation (<span data-balloon-pos="up" aria-label="Frequency Modulation">FM</span>) is commonly used to add the audio
signal to the subcarrier (<span data-balloon-pos="up" aria-label="Subcarrier">SC</span>) signal, whilst the combined signal (SC+FM) can be
added to the <span data-balloon-pos="up" aria-label="Radio Frequency">RF</span> with either <span data-balloon-pos="up" aria-label="Frequency Modulation">FM</span> or Amplitude Modulation (<span data-balloon-pos="up" aria-label="Amplitude Modulation">AM</span>).
The diagram above shows how the modulated subcarrier signal would appear
as the two sidebands of an <span data-balloon-pos="up" aria-label="Amplitude Modulation">AM</span> signal. Pretty much any
frequency above the audible range can be used for the subcarrier.
Common <span data-balloon-pos="up" aria-label="Subcarrier">SC</span> frequencies are 12.5 kHz, 22 kHz and 40 kHz.
<table><tbody><tr><td>
            <div>

            </p>
            </div></td></tr><tr><td>
          </td></tr></tbody></table>
<br>
When frequency modulating the carrier with a frequency-modulated subcarrier,
the presence of the audio signal is even less noticable, especially when the
channel's baseband is modulated with a strong noise or hum signal
(<a href="#sc_imp"><span data-balloon-pos="up" aria-label="Jump to: see below">see below</span></a>).
In such cases, the contribution of the audio signal is marginal compared
to the subcarrier, which itself is marginal compared to the injected noise.
<p>

One of the first known uses of subcarrier modulation is in wired telephony,
where it was used to send multiple telephone coversations over a single wire pair,
thereby effectively increasing the capacity of the network.
One of the first uses in <a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/covert/bugs/index.htm"><span data-balloon-pos="up" aria-label="More about: covert listening devices">covert listening devices</span></a>
was in 1958 with the
<span aria-label="Central Intelligence Agency (USA)" data-balloon-pos="up"><a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/intel/cia">CIA</a></span>'s <a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/covert/bugs/ec/ec3/index.htm"><span data-balloon-pos="up" aria-label="More about: Easy Chair Mark III">Easy Chair Mark III</span></a>,
where it was used to hide the audio.
In the later <a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/covert/bugs/ec/ec5/index.htm"><span data-balloon-pos="up" aria-label="More about: Easy Chair Mark V">Easy Chair Mark V</span></a>
it was even used to listen to up to three
Passive Elements (PEs) in the same target area simultaneously.
</p><p>

SC-modulation is arguably the most commonly used audio masking scheme for
professional as well as semi-professional bugs. During the Cold War, it was
used heavily by inteligence services like the American <span aria-label="Central Intelligence Agency (USA)" data-balloon-pos="up"><a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/intel/cia">CIA</a></span> and the
East-German Stasi. Especially the latter (Stasi) is known to have produced
a wide range of telephone and room bugging devices that feature SC-techniques.

Despite the fact that SC-modulated bugs are often used by intelligence

Silent carriers are very difficult to identify, as they are
also produced as <i>spurious</i> by-products of domestic equipment, computers
and even by the surveillance receiver itself. When scanning a frequency band,
it will be difficult to distinguish an SC-modulated bug from a spurious signal.

To make identification of the signal even more difficult, some manufacturers
injected noise or a strong 50/60 Hz hum into the signal's base­band, so that the
carrier was no longer silent.
<p>

A good example of the latter is the
<b>bug that was found in the {?OPEC</b> headquarters=../opec/index.htm}
in Vienna in the late 1970s. By injecting a very strong 50 Hz hum into the baseband,
it was hoped that a sweep team checking the room for bugs, would discard it as
interference from a domestic applience or a transformer.
Despite the improvement however, this scheme is defeated by a

Around 1974, the <span aria-label="Central Intelligence Agency (USA)" data-balloon-pos="up"><a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/intel/cia">CIA</a></span> introduced the <a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/covert/bugs/srt105/index.htm"><span data-balloon-pos="up" aria-label="More about: SRT-105">SRT-105</span></a>,
a miniature bug with <span data-balloon-pos="up" aria-label="Subcarrier">SC</span> audio masking, in which noise was injected into the baseband.
When scanning the frequency band, this noise is difficult to distinguish from the
background noise that is present in any empty radio channel. Nevertheless,
noise-injected SC bugs are just as easily defeated by a Scanlock receiver
as normal SC bugs, so they hardly
provide any effective protection against discovery by a professional sweep team.

the <span aria-label="Central Intelligence Agency (USA)" data-balloon-pos="up"><a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/intel/cia">CIA</a></span> kept using this scheme for many years. In 1981, they even introduced

This suggests that the <span aria-label="Central Intelligence Agency (USA)" data-balloon-pos="up"><a href="https://www.cryptomuseum.com/intel/cia">CIA</a></span> may have done this deliberately, so that the

less easy to find, bugs planted in the same room.
There is an unwritten law in the surveillance business, that for every
bug that has been found, there are four undiscovered ones.

Double Sideband with Suppressed Carrier (<span data-balloon-pos="up" aria-label="Double Sideband with Suppressed Carrier">DSBSC</span>) is a rarely used
audio masking scheme that defeats most bug finding equipment. In most cases,
the audio signal is amplitude modulated (<span data-balloon-pos="up" aria-label="Amplitude Modulation">AM</span>) onto a carrier above the
audible range (e.g. 20 kHz), which in turn is frequency modulated (<span data-balloon-pos="up" aria-label="Frequency Modulation">FM</span>)
onto the <span data-balloon-pos="up" aria-label="Radio Frequency">RF</span> carrier. The 20 kHz subcarrier itself is suppressed, or
ideally eliminated.

On a spectrum analyser, the signal will look like any modulated <span data-balloon-pos="up" aria-label="Frequency Modulation">FM</span> signal.
However, after demodulating the <span data-balloon-pos="up" aria-label="Frequency Modulation">FM</span> signal, the result is an <span data-balloon-pos="up" aria-label="Audio Frequency">AF</span> signal
that contains speech information well above the audible range. Furthermore,
the original sub-carrier (20 kHz) as been removed, as a result of which it
cannot be re-inserted automatically by a bug tracer like the

The diagram above shows the audio frequency spectrum (<span data-balloon-pos="up" aria-label="Audio Frequency">AF</span>) after demodulation
of the <span data-balloon-pos="up" aria-label="Frequency Modulation">FM</span> radio frequency carrier (<span data-balloon-pos="up" aria-label="Radio Frequency">RF</span>). The audible range is approx. from
30 to 10,000 Hz (in practice often 30-300 Hz). The <span data-balloon-pos="up" aria-label="Amplitude Modulation">AM</span> modulated subcarrier
has two sidebands: an upper sideband (USB) and a lower sideband (LSB),
but as the subcarrier is removed, the relation between the sidebands and their
carrier is lost. The signal can only be recovered in a compatible receiver,
in which the 20 kHz carrier is added in again, but for this to work, the
recipient has to know the exact frequency.
<p>

This masking scheme can be further improved by injecting noise or a strong
50/60 Hz hum in the baseband. This will obscure the (faint) sidebands in
the 20 kHz range.

The system takes sound samples at random intervals,
under control of a noise generator, and transmits these in pulse
position modulation (PPM). In the above diagram, the random samples are shown in red
as T1, T2 and T3. Each pulse is enclosed within two reference pulses (green)
that have a fixed distance (d). Each pulse has the same width and amplitude.
The actual audio intelligence is carried in the position
of the red pulse, relative to the two green reference pulses.

Each pulse is approx. 0.5 µs long and resembles a square wave. As a result
of this,
this type of modulation produces a multitude of sidebands at either side of
the carrier. In practice, the band­width of the signal can be up to
100 MHz, especially when in close proximity of the transmitter.

to find its location, simply by looking for the bearing with
the strongest signal and walking towards it. Finding the strongest
signal by means of a spectrum analyser is not easy though, even not

of at least 100 metres.
It is capable of demodulating AM, FM, PM, CW and SSB

It is also remarkable that the Delta-V does not suffer from the strong
RF signal from the nearby broadcasting station that has caused us
many headaches before.
It can be concluded from the above tests, that finding a
PPM bug is not evident, but with the right tools it certainly is
possible.

In this scheme, samples are taken at fixed intervals 'i' (shown in red)
and transmitted in Pulse Position Modulation (PPM). Under control of a noise
generator, up to five consecutive pulses are rejected (shown in grey),
resulting in a noisy pulse pattern. The relative position of each
surviving pulse carries the actual intelligence, which can be only recovered
in an RP-compatible receiver.

Each pulse is approx. 0.5 µs long and resembles a square wave. As a result
of this,
this type of modulation produces a multitude of sidebands at either side of
the carrier. In practice, the band­width of the signal can be up to
100 MHz, especially when in close proximity of the transmitter.

In this scheme, samples are taken at fixed intervals (i) and are transmitted
as Pulse Position Modulation (PPM). Under control of a noise generator, the
back porch of each pulse is delayed in time by a randomly determined
value (r). Only the relative position of the front porch contains intelligence.
The spectrum diagram is nearly identical to the previous two schemes.
<p>

It was later discovered that when a DP-masked signal was received by
an overloaded or blocking receiver, automatic demodulation could occur,
as a result of which the transmitter would loose its masking capability.
A similar scheme, known as Super Pulse (SP) did not have this drawback as
it moved the rising edge of the pulse forward in time. In the end,
the Super Pulse masking scheme was renamed Dirty Pulse, and the existing
transmitters and receivers were all modified.

Microsoft’s licensing terms restrict </span><span>European </span><span>customers from moving their current Microsoft workloads to competitors’ clouds – despite there being no technical barriers to doing so – or impose what Microsoft admits is a striking </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230328163736/https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/azure-vs-aws/cost-savings/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>400% price markup</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Microsoft is the only cloud provider to use these tactics, which have significantly harmed European companies and governments. Not only have they </span><a href="https://cispe.cloud/the-billion-euro-unfair-software-licence-tax-on-eu-customers/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>cost European businesses at least €1 billion a year</span></a><span>, but also they have led to adverse downstream effects, including waste of tax funds, stifled competition, restrictions on distributors and channel partners, and heightened risk for organizations exposed to Microsoft’s </span><a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/cyber-safety-review-board-finds-microsoft-security-culture-inadequate-calls-for-internal-accountability/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>“inadequate” security culture</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Like many others, w</span><span>e have attempted to engage directly with Microsoft. We have kicked off an industry dialogue on fair and open cloud licensing. And we have advocated on behalf of European customers and partners who fear retaliation in the form of </span><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/666196c287d3bfaf688c86a1/Licensing_practices__final.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>audits or worse</span></a><span> if they speak up. </span><span>Unfortunately, instead of changing its practices, Microsoft has </span><a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/microsoft-to-pay-off-cloud-industry-group-to-end-eu-antitrust-complaint/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>struck one-off deals</span></a><span> with a small group of companies.</span></p>
<p><span>To give voice to the complaints we hear from customers – and from across the industry – and to seek a resolution that will benefit everyone, we are now taking the next step of filing a formal complaint with the European Commission.</span></p>
<h3><strong>How Microsoft’s anticompetitive licensing practices work&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p><span>While Microsoft’s licensing practices apply to many enterprise products, Windows Server is central to the company’s strategy of locking customers into Azure. Windows Server is a must-have workhorse in many IT environments, serving as the backbone for applications, files, and services. And it has already added billions of dollars to Microsoft’s revenues. When businesses and governments originally paid for Windows Server licenses, they had the right to run them on any hardware they wished – and did so for many years on machines from HP, Dell, Lenovo, and others.</span></p>
<p><span>However, as cloud computing took off and promised to bring new benefits to European businesses, customers wanted to move their previously purchased licenses to other cloud providers, and in some cases to multiple clouds, to provide additional resiliency and security. Initially, Microsoft allowed them to do this. But as Azure faced more competition, Microsoft introduced new rules that severely limited customer choice.</span></p>
<p><span>One of the most significant restrictions occurred in 2019, when Microsoft adopted new licensing terms that imposed extreme financial penalties on businesses wanting to use Windows Server software on Azure’s closest competitors, such as Google Cloud and AWS. Microsoft’s own statements indicate that customers who want to move their workloads to these competitors would need to pay up to </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230328163736/https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/azure-vs-aws/cost-savings/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>five times more</span></a><span>. And for those who choose to keep running Windows Server on competitors’ cloud platforms (despite the cost difference), Microsoft introduced additional obstacles over the last few years, such as limiting security patches and creating other interoperability barriers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Harm to European customers, vendors, and cloud markets&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p><span>According to research from Professor Frédéric Jenny, </span><span>a French economist and chairman of the OECD Competition Committee, EU customers face significant</span><span> </span><a href="https://cispe.cloud/the-billion-euro-unfair-software-licence-tax-on-eu-customers/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>hidden costs</span></a><span> due to Microsoft’s restrictive licensing that go well beyond inflated pricing. These include taxpayer waste, money diverted from investments in growth, and slower digital transformations. We have heard many of these same complaints from customers.</span></p>
<p><span>Restrictive licensing also stifles innovation and competition, preventing European companies from using multiple clouds, including European cloud providers. According to </span><a href="https://cispe.cloud/executive-summary-of-cispe-complaint-against-microsoft/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>one recent study</span></a><span>, after the 2019 licensing changes, Microsoft’s cloud market share suddenly skyrocketed, largely at the expense of European providers.</span></p>
<p><span>Security and reliability suffer too. As highlighted by the massive security outage two months ago, Microsoft’s lock-in tactics can result in a </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/technology/microsoft-crowdstrike-outage-what-happened.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>single point of failure</span></a><span> that harms businesses, industries, and governments. Without diversity in vendors, cyber attacks become more frequent. </span><a href="https://www.fairsoftwarelicensing.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Prescient-Cyber-Tax-Report-11.2023.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Research</span></a><span> from Prescient finds that anticompetitive licensing leads to higher cyber-insurance premiums, incident response costs, and cloud service costs.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Importance of fair and open licensing</strong></h3>
<p><span>Google Cloud’s approach is different. We </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/ensuring-fair-and-open-competition-in-the-cloud"><span>promote fair and transparent licensing for our customers</span></a><span>. We pioneered a </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/hybrid-cloud/new-platform-for-managing-applications-in-todays-multi-cloud-world"><span>multi-cloud infrastructure service</span></a><span> and a </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/introducing-bigquery-omni"><span>multi-cloud data warehouse</span></a><span>, enabling workloads to run across multiple clouds. And we were the first company to provide </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/advancing-digital-sovereignty-on-europes-terms"><span>digital sovereignty solutions</span></a><span> for European governments and to </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/networking/eliminating-data-transfer-fees-when-migrating-off-google-cloud"><span>waive exit fees</span></a><span> for customers wishing to switch cloud providers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Our point is a simple one: Restrictive cloud licensing practices hurt companies and impede European competitiveness. We look forward to continuing this discussion on how to keep the cloud market fair and open for European businesses and governments.</span></p></span></section><section><span>Posted in</span><ul><li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/inside-google-cloud" track-metadata-position="body" track-metadata-eventdetail="cloud.google.com/blog/topics/inside-google-cloud" track-metadata-module="tag list" track-metadata-module_headline="posted in">Inside Google Cloud</a></li></ul></section></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p><strong>Article updated on Sept. 18, 2024.</strong></p>
<p><span><strong>Case update from Sept. 12</strong>: The Circuit Court for St. Louis County, Missouri denied Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell’s motion to vacate <a href="https://innocenceproject.org/court-denies-prosecutors-motion-to-vacate-marcellus-williams-conviction-and-death-sentence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Marcellus Williams’</span></a> conviction and death sentence.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Case update from July 2</strong>: The Circuit Court of St. Louis County, Missouri, scheduled a hearing for August 21, 2024, to assess the “clear and convincing evidence” of actual innocence that led Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell to move to vacate Marcellus Williams’ wrongful conviction and death sentence.</span></p>
<p><span>There is no reliable evidence proving that <a href="https://innocenceproject.org/petitions/stop-the-execution-of-marcellus-williams-an-innocent-man/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Marcellus Williams</span></a> committed the crime for which he is scheduled to be executed on Sept. 24. The State destroyed or corrupted the evidence that could conclusively prove his innocence and the available DNA and other forensic crime-scene evidence does not match him.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Even the victim’s family believes life without parole is the appropriate sentence.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Time is running out to stop Missouri from executing an innocent person on Sept. 24.</strong> Now it’s up to Gov. Mike Parson to grant clemency and commute Mr. Williams’ sentence to life without parole, or, at a minimum, stay the execution for further appeals to be resolved.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Here’s what you need to know about his case:</span></strong></p>
<h4><b></b><span><b>1. A crime scene covered with forensic evidence contained no link to Mr. Williams.</b></span></h4>
<p><span>Mr. Williams has been seeking to prove his innocence throughout the 23 years he has spent on Missouri’s death row. On August 11, 1998, Felicia Gayle, a former reporter for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, was found stabbed to death in her home. The perpetrator left behind considerable forensic evidence, including fingerprints, footprints, hair, and trace <a href="https://dpic-cdn.org/production/legacy/MarcellusWilliamsBoardOfInquiryLetter.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>DNA on the murder weapon</span></a>, a knife from Ms. Gayle’s kitchen. <b>None of this forensic evidence matches Mr. Williams.&nbsp;</b></span></p>
<h4><b></b><span><b>2. The prosecution’s case against Mr. Williams was based entirely on the unreliable testimony of two incentivized witnesses.</b></span></h4>
<p><span>The case against Mr. Williams turned on the testimony of two unreliable witnesses who were incentivized by promises of leniency in their own pending criminal cases and reward money. The investigation had gone cold until a jail inmate named Henry Cole, a man with a lengthy record, claimed that Mr. Williams confessed to him that he committed the murder while they were both locked up in jail. Cole directed police to Laura Asaro, a woman who had briefly dated Mr. Williams and had an extensive record of her own.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Both of these individuals were known fabricators; neither revealed any information that was not either included in media accounts about the case or already known to the police. Their statements were inconsistent with their own prior statements, with each other’s accounts, and with the crime scene evidence, and none of the information they provided could be independently verified. Aside from their testimony, the only evidence connecting Mr. Williams to the crime was a witness who said Mr. Williams sold him a laptop taken from Ms. Gayle’s home, but the jury did not learn that Mr. Williams told the witness he had received the laptop from Laura Asaro.</span></p>
<h4><strong><span>3. Mr. Williams has repeatedly faced imminent execution as he has tried to prove his innocence.</span></strong></h4>
<p><span>Nine years ago, the Missouri Supreme Court stayed Mr. Williams’s execution and appointed a special master to review DNA testing of potentially exculpatory evidence. The DNA testing conducted in 2016 showed that Mr. Williams was not the source of male DNA found on the murder weapon.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, in 2017, after the testing was completed but without conducting a hearing or making any findings based on the outcome of the testing, the appointed special master sent Mr. Williams’s case back to the Missouri Supreme Court. That court, also without considering the DNA testing results, again scheduled Mr. Williams’s execution. On Aug. 22, 2017, mere hours before he was to be executed and after eating his last meal, Mr. Williams received a stay of execution from then-Governor Eric Greitens.</span></p>
<p><span>Governor Greitens recognized that the new DNA results raised serious doubts about Mr. Williams’s guilt, and he convened a Board of Inquiry to investigate the case. Under Missouri law, the stay was to remain in place until the Board of Inquiry concluded its review and issued a formal report.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, in June 2023, while the Board of Inquiry’s review remained ongoing, Governor Mike Parson without warning or notice dissolved the Board without a report or recommendation from the Board. Immediately after Governor Parson dissolved the Board of Inquiry, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey sought a new execution date.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Williams filed a civil suit against Governor Parson because the dissolution of the Board without a report or recommendation violated Missouri law and Mr. Williams’s constitutional rights. After a Cole County judge denied the Governor’s motion to dismiss this lawsuit, the Governor persuaded the Missouri Supreme Court to intervene.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>On June 4, 2024, the Missouri Supreme Court dismissed Mr. Williams’s civil lawsuit and immediately scheduled his execution for Sept. 24.</span></p>
<h4><strong><span>4. Although the victim’s family opposes Mr. Williams’ execution, the Missouri Attorney General has continued to fight to execute him.</span></strong></h4>
<p><span>After the corruption of the key DNA evidence came to light, Mr. Williams and the St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office reached an agreement to ensure Mr. Williams is not wrongfully executed. Mr. Williams agreed to enter an Alford plea, admitting that the State has sufficient evidence to support his conviction, in exchange for a sentence of life without parole.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The victim’s family supported this resolution of Mr. Williams’ case and have said they do not want Mr. Williams to be executed. On Aug. 21 the circuit court entered the consent judgment based on the parties’ agreement.</span></p>
<p><span>Despite the closure this resolution would have brought to the case, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey sought a writ of prohibition from the Missouri Supreme Court, which that court granted, ordering the circuit court to hold the previously scheduled evidentiary hearing.</span></p>
<p><span>The circuit court held an evidentiary hearing on August 28 and subsequently ruled that it lacked sufficient evidence on which to find that Mr. Williams is innocent, and that his claims of racially biased jury selection and ineffective assistance of counsel had previously been raised and rejected. Accordingly, the court denied Prosecuting Attorney Bell’s motion to vacate Mr. Williams’ conviction.</span></p>
<p><span>The Prosecuting Attorney is appealing that ruling to the Missouri Supreme Court.</span></p>
<h4><span><b>5. Incentivized informants are a leading cause of wrongful convictions.</b></span></h4>
<p><span><b>&nbsp;</b></span><span>Jailhouse informant testimony, like that leading to Mr. Williams’ conviction, is one of the leading contributing factors of wrongful convictions nationally, playing a role in <a href="https://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/detaillist.aspx?View=%7BFAF6EDDB-5A68-4F8F-8A52-2C61F5BF9EA7%7D&amp;FilterField1=DNA&amp;FilterValue1=8%5FDNA&amp;FilterField2=Group&amp;FilterValue2=JI" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>15% of the 598</span></a> DNA-based exoneration cases. <a href="https://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/detaillist.aspx?View=%7BFAF6EDDB-5A68-4F8F-8A52-2C61F5BF9EA7%7D&amp;FilterField1=ST&amp;FilterValue1=MO&amp;FilterField2=Group&amp;FilterValue2=JI" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Eleven</span></a> of the 54 individuals exonerated in Missouri were convicted with the use of informant testimony.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In capital cases, false testimony from incentivized witnesses is the leading cause of wrongful convictions, with informant testimony present in 49.5% of wrongful convictions since the mid-1970s, according to the Center on Wrongful Convictions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><b></b><span><b>6. Racial bias contributed to Mr. Williams’ wrongful conviction.</b></span></h4>
<p><span>Mr. Williams, a Black man, was wrongfully convicted of murdering a white woman. His jury was comprised of 11 white people and only one Black person. The prosecutor, whose institutional practice of racially discriminatory jury selection has been widely <a href="https://www.riverfronttimes.com/news/how-missouri-prosecutors-get-away-with-striking-black-jurors-38943100" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>documented</span></a>, successfully removed six of seven qualified Black prospective jurors with peremptory challenges. A <a href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/news/new-study-finds-significant-race-of-victim-disparities-in-st-louis-county-death-sentencing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>recent study</span></a> of 400 death-eligible cases in St. Louis County over a 27-year period also revealed racial disparity in the use of the death penalty based upon the race of the victim. People who were convicted were 3.5 times more likely to receive the death penalty if the victim was white, as in this case, compared to if the victim was Black.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><b></b><span><b>7. Mr. Williams is devoutly religious and an accomplished poet.</b></span></h4>
<p><span>During his 23 years in prison, Mr. Williams has devoted much of his time to studying Islam and <a href="https://innocenceproject.org/marcellus-williams-on-death-row-poetry-is-a-lifeline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>writing poetry</span></a>. He serves as the imam for Muslim prisoners at Potosi Correctional Center and is known a</span><span>s “Khaliifah,” meaning leader in Arabic. </span><span>He has an exemplary prison record and is widely respected within the prison community and beyond.</span></p>
<h4><b></b><span><b>8. You can help stop Mr. Williams’ unjust execution.&nbsp;</b></span></h4>
<p><span>We have until Sept. 24 at 6 p.m. to stop Mr. Williams’ execution. Here’s how you can help stop this irreversible injustice:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://innocenceproject.org/petitions/call-gov-parson-to-stop-the-sept-24-execution-of-marcellus-williams-417-373-3400/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call Gov. Parson at 417-373-3400</a></li>
<li><span><a href="https://innocenceproject.org/petitions/stop-the-execution-of-marcellus-williams-an-innocent-man/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Sign the petition to stop Mr. Williams’ execution</span></a></span><span>.</span></li>
<li><span>Share Mr. Williams’ case on all social media channels using <a href="https://socialpresskit.com/savemarcellus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our social media toolkit</a>.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Use your voice<b> —&nbsp;</b>create an Instagram post, reel, or TikTok to share the background of Mr. Williams’ case, the reasons he’s innocent, and all the missteps in this miscarriage of justice, and urge your followers to sign our petition.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>With the weight of this new evidence and the unreliability of the witnesses who testified against Mr. Williams, his conviction must be reevaluated to ensure that justice is truly served. Dedicated professionals from the Innocence Project, <a href="https://themip.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Midwest Innocence Project</span></a>, and Bryan Cave, along with attorneys Larry Komp <span>of the Federal Public Defender, Western District of Missouri, </span> and Kent Gipson, make up the team that continues to fight to stop his Sept. 24 execution. They hope that justice will eventually prevail by way of an exoneration.</span></p>

<p>The maps in this post were rendered with <a href="https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html">QGIS</a> version 3.36. QGIS is a desktop application that runs on Windows, macOS and Linux. The software is very popular in the geospatial industry and was launched almost 15 million times in May last year.</p>
<p>I used QGIS' <a href="https://geoinformaticsworld.com/how-to-download-and-install-google-earth-images-in-qgis-using-tiles-plugin/">Tile+ plugin</a> to add satellite basemaps. Tile+ can be installed from its ZIP distributable.</p>

<p>Each file is a location which will be run by a network operator. Each location will have one or more charging stations / bays. A station can have one or more sockets as well as various power delivery specifications. These sockets and power delivery specifications are listed individually in the 'Connections' dictionary and each connection will have a quantity associated with it.</p>
<p>In the above example, only a single vehicle can be charged at any one time at this location and both a 50 kW, DC, 120A, 500V CHAdeMO socket as well as a 22 kW, AC (Three-Phase), 32A, 400V Type 2 socket are supported.</p>
<p>The location files use primary keys for many attributes. Their corresponding records can be found in a <tt>referencedata.json</tt> file included in the git repository. Below are the 13 reference table names for this project.</p>

The vast majority of these photos were taken in Europe with the US and Australia being the only other locations of any significance. Below is the proportion of disk space used by the images broken down by region and country.</p>

<p>Some photos are great research material with equipment and signage clearly presented. Others show the surrounding area and landscape which could be a replacement for Google Street View. This is handy as it can show if there is a canopy or if it's in underground / sheltered parking of some sort.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>We're Wafris, an open-source web application firewall company that, among other frameworks, ships a Rails middleware client.</p>
<p>At launch, the v1 client required a local Redis datastore to be deployed with your app. We're now releasing v2 of our Rails client which uses SQLite as the backing datastore.</p>
<p>This article covers the decision-making that went into our migration from Redis to SQLite, performance considerations, and architectural changes. Continue reading this if you're interested in the decision-making that went into our migration to SQLite from Redis for our clients (the deployed middleware)</p>
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<ul>
<li>SQLite has things it's good and bad at.</li>
<li>Redis has things it's good and bad at.</li>
<li>Traditional RDBMS (Postgres/MySQL) have things they're good and bad at.</li>
</ul>
<p>These data stores are not drop-in replacements, and if you try to do that, you'll have a bad time. This article walks through the testing and decision-making that went into rearchitecting our v1 Redis-based client to our v2 SQLite-based client.</p>
<h2>What forced this change?</h2>
<p>Since day one of Wafris, our goal has been to make it as easy as possible for developers to protect their sites.</p>
<p>But our v1 has had mixed results in delivering on that promise. We made what we thought at the time was a solid choice to back the Wafris client with a user-owned (bring your own) Redis datastore.</p>
<p>Partially, this was due to our having come up in the Heroku ecosystem, where Redis is an easy click away to get going and deployed in such a way that it's easy to access remotely. We also looked at successful projects like Sidekiq, which had a similar model.</p>
<blockquote><p>If we're trying to make things easy on you, we shouldn't casually make you a Redis database admin in the process.</p></blockquote>
<p>But the ecosystem is much larger than that, and many of our users encountered Redis deployment issues that were difficult to debug and fix.</p>
<p>In other words, if we're trying to make things easy on you, we shouldn't casually make you a Redis database admin in the process.</p>
<p>Further, when we exhibited at <a href="https://wafris.org/blog/railsworld-2023-recap" rel="follow">RailsWorld 2023</a>, there was a definite "blood in the water" vibe regarding Redis and the assumption that you'd automatically need a Redis server running alongside your Rails application.</p>
<h2>What is Speed?</h2>
<p>While Redis is "fast" in comparison to traditional RDBMS, it's still a database that you have to manage connections, memory, processes, etc., which introduces more brittleness into the stack (the opposite of what we're trying to achieve).</p>
<p>And more than any of those, if you're in a cloud environment, you're looking at network latency. Network delays are a big deal for us as every inbound HTTP request to your app must be evaluated against the rules stored in Wafris. So while we sweated blood and code to get our v1 client as fast as possible, we'd often wind up in situations where, despite our best efforts, we'd still slow down an application as the network the app was provisioned into was slow.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.buttercms.com/Qgraed3TIekXzqhffUFR" alt="network-latency.webp" width="565" height="228"></p>

<h2>Monolith-ish Assumptions</h2>
<p>While there certainly exist wholly distributed applications out there, and while most Rails apps are "majestic monoliths" (tm? idk, don't sue me), we've found a lot of distributed apps that messed up our assumptions.</p>
<p>Apps that deploy to multiple zones, split functionality into servers with overlapping responsibilities, or are only partially Rails and deployed alongside other languages or frameworks.</p>
<p>Mostly, things aren't that clean in production, introducing even more friction with using Redis.</p>
<h2>Forcing a rethink of our architecture</h2>
<p>Wafris is a web application firewall. In Rails, it's installed as a middleware. It lets you set rules like "block the IP 1.2.3.4," and then when someone requests your site, you evaluate that request against those rules.</p>
<p>Imagine it's this simplified two-step process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Compare HTTP request against the rules (if match == 403, else 200)</li>
<li>Report treatment (blocked, allowed, passed)</li>
</ol>
<p>Abstractly, this is a paired "read" of the rules in the database (step 2) and then a "write" of the report detailing what was done with that request along with its data.</p>
<p>From a logical standpoint, the first "read" half of this process is vastly more important than the latter "write" half:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reads, aka "requests," need to be handled sequentially</li>
<li>Filtering of requests <em>must</em> work or bad requests could get through</li>
<li>Reads, aka "requests," are time-sensitive as they affect user-perceived site performance.</li>
<li>Writes, aka "reporting," can be done slower, batched, async, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Enter SQLite</h2>
<p>Others have written far more eloquently about what SQLite is suitable for in general than I could ever hope to do so myself, so on that topic, I'll point you to the following resources:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aaron Francis' "High Performance SQLite" course at <a href="https://highperformancesqlite.com/" rel="follow">https://highperformancesqlite.com/</a></li>
<li>Stephen Margheim's "SQLite on Rails" - <a href="https://fractaledmind.github.io/2024/04/15/sqlite-on-rails-the-how-and-why-of-optimal-performance/" rel="follow">the how and why of optimal performance</a>&nbsp;</li>
<li>Oldmoe - <a href="https://oldmoe.blog/" rel="follow">https://oldmoe.blog/</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>What's good about SQLite for Wafris?</h2>
<p>As noted above, our major bottleneck is network IO, and Stephen mentioned this line from the SQLite documentation: "SQLite does not compete with client/server databases. SQLite competes with fopen()."</p>
<blockquote><p>SQLite does not compete with client/server databases. SQLite competes with fopen().</p></blockquote>
<p>In theory, this should be much faster than a Redis solution solely based on cutting out the network round trip.</p>
<p>So, we decided to benchmark SQLite vs Redis.</p>
<h2>Benchmarking SQLite and Redis</h2>
<p>Benchmarking is a dark art of deceiving yourself with highly precise numbers.</p>
<p>And benchmarketing datastores is even more fraught. Every single flipping database benchmark I've ever seen has been covered in a layer of asterisks and qualifications, and the comments on HN are full of "if you'd just set this flag when compiling it, you'd get 3% more speed out of reads, and the fact that the people running this didn't do this is proof that they were paid off and that they actively sell shady NFT scams of deranged yacht rock Harambe memes.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.buttercms.com/4QeEUKlrSmSXIwf4F6by" alt="undefined" width="351" height="351"></p>
<p>However, we have an advantage here. We're not trying to get some absolute number of speed under pristine conditions and carefully tweaked settings. We are creating a wildly specific and biased benchmark against our own data in a use case that lends itself to some extremes that I would neither expect nor hope that anyone else would have to deal with.</p>

<h3>Studiously ignoring optimization tweaks</h3>
<p>We're trying to optimize for people throwing Wafris into their app and having it "Just Work™" (ok, this one might actually be <a href="https://trademarks.justia.com/776/82/it-just-works-77682144.html">trademarked</a>).</p>
<p>We're also not testing against some theoretical benchmark suite (that can be gamed ala <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/01/28/nvidia_tpc_benchmark/#::text=Nvidia%20has%20been%20accused%20of,very%20umpires%20of%20the%20test">NVIDIA</a>).</p>
<p>We're testing the hot path of <em>our</em> own application and <em>our</em> worst query.</p>
<p>Our worst query is a somewhat complicated request for a "lexical decimal" data structure that maps IP ranges (v4 and v6) against categories. The simplest to consider is IP -&gt; Country mapping, where we return the country if an IP address is within a range of two addresses.</p>
<p>It's terrible because these structures are, by necessity, large (millions of rows), and in the case of IPv6, every single entry is huge.</p>
<p>To make this happen, we precompute the range lookups and then wrote them to:</p>
<ul>
<li>A table in SQLite</li>
<li>A <a href="https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/data-types/sorted-sets/">sorted set</a> in Redis</li>
</ul>
<p>For each inbound HTTP request, we, in the pathological case, have to check the requesting IP against:</p>
<ol>
<li>Custom Allow ranges</li>
<li>Custom Block ranges</li>
<li>GeoIP ranges</li>
<li>IP Reputation ranges</li>
</ol>
<p>This is what we mean by "hot path"—this singular query type is so important that we can ignore all the rest of the query types and functions.<a href="https://moderndaymoguls.com/2020/01/05/peloton-bike/" rel="follow"></a></p>
<p>So, for our benchmarking scripts, we tested only this one query type, saving us days of work porting more significant (but irrelevant to the hot path) portions of the app to the benchmark.</p>
<h2>The Testing Protocol</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.buttercms.com/HklvqQLITaOLUv9bna3b" alt="undefined"></p>
<p>Testing was done on my local Macbook Air M2 with a homebrew installed Redis and local SQLite db.</p>
<ol>
<li>We tested against our existing ranges dataset (1.2 million entries)</li>
<li>Multiple sets of IPs were then run in the same order against both SQLite and Redis.</li>
<li>At each multiple, we ran the test 5 times and took the average of the runs.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Testing Results</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.buttercms.com/gd2RyAi4RGiz44JhWGOH" alt="undefined" width="739" height="554"></p>

<p>SQLite beat Redis like an overhyped UFC fighter doing a jump off the fence to land a kick punch (for our particular use case in this niche)</p>
<p>SQLite was roughly a 3x speed improvement over a locally deployed Redis instance. YMMV. Note again that this is before any network latency is considered.</p>
<p>From our perspective, this was a fantastic result as even if SQLite were only on par with Redis locally, we'd still win by being able to entirely axe network times.</p>
<p>I'd like to stress again that this is extremely flawed testing (by design) with really naive settings, but it is done in a way that mirrors the flaws of real-world usage we observed.</p>
<h2>What's missing from the chart?</h2>
<p>Benchmarks exist in a vacuum. What the chart fails to capture is that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Even if the SQLite performance was significantly worse (like 2x worse) in the benchmark, it would <em>still</em> probably be faster in the "real world" because of network latency, even to a Redis that was in the same data center/region</li>
<li>Even if you had a super robust Redis server (cluster, sharded, etc.), there are still a bunch of limits around it for network bandwidth, connections, etc., and again cross-region latency. SQLite gets us near-infinite horizontal scaling for "free"; more on this below.</li>
<li>The onboarding is so much better with SQLite - I imagine most users won't even know that it's being used; they'll just add the gem to their web app and be up and running.</li>
<li>There are a lot of potential improvements that could be done to get more juice out of Redis. However, we've been unable to consistently persuade users to make even basic configuration changes (like cache eviction policy) to their Redis setups as it's such a pain and they don't want to be Redis admins.</li>
</ul>
<p>We're focused on:</p>
<ol>
<li>Making Wafris easy to deploy</li>
<li>Making rule evaluation as fast as possible</li>
</ol>
<p>Everything else flows from that, so that's what we're rearchitecting towards. NOT "the best database setup," not "the easiest infrastructure for us (Wafris) to manage," etc.</p>
<h2>Results are just the start</h2>
<p>Great, so now that we've established that SQLite is faster than Redis (caveats, caveats, caveats), everything still isn't great because there are real-world tradeoffs.</p>
<p>One <em>huge</em> tradeoff in the testing above is that we didn't even consider doing any writes.</p>
<p>While it's never really stated, the whole reason for a "proper" database to have connections, connection pools, transactions, and whatever proprietary magic allows Oracle to charge a billion dollars for a database is to manage writes contending with reads for data in your database.</p>
<p>Consider an electric Chinese supercar driven by a charming British man - it's fast, it's fantastic, and it is absolute bollocks at hauling a load of concrete blocks across town.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzFT5ndMZ_Q" rel="follow"><img src="https://cdn.buttercms.com/iX3Bns2ySayFT5LOKidM" alt="undefined" width="713" height="398"></a></p>
<p>SQLite is like that NIO EP9 supercar. We need to use it for what it's good at and not force it into a role it's not suited for.</p>
<h2>Building a sync architecture</h2>
<p>On v1 (Redis), the update loop looked like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>User updates a rule ("block the IP 1.2.3.4") in Wafris Hub</li>
<li>Wafris Hub updates the rules in your Redis datastore</li>
</ol>
<p>This obviously won't work with SQLite because we can't "push" a SQLite database to a web server. There are some newer SQLite as a service providers that let you do a version of this, but for a variety of cost, performance, and security considerations, it won't work for us as we'd still need individual users to deploy them, open ports, allow inbound connections, etc.</p>
<p>On v2 (SQLite), the update loop looks like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>User updates a rule ("block the IP 1.2.3.4") in Wafris Hub</li>
<li>At some interval (time or number of requests), the client checks for updated rules</li>
<li>If rules are updated, the client downloads an entirely new SQLite database</li>
</ol>
<p>This works well as it removes much of the user's installation and configuration responsibility.</p>
<p>We're seeing a ~3x increase in successful installs of the v2 client.</p>
<h2>SQLite Distributed Architecture</h2>
<p>Consider a Rails app deployed to a cloud provider (AWS, Heroku, Fly, etc). with autoscaling enabled.</p>
<p>Your requests go from 100 req/s to 10,000 req/s. and your compute (dynos, machines, ec2 instances) start spinning up to handle the load, but does your database?</p>
<p>The answer is almost certainly no because a bottleneck is a bottleneck without the database, and while you could overprovision it by 100x "just in case," realistically, nobody wants to do that.</p>
<p><code><img src="https://cdn.buttercms.com/F4yeDPLUSN2JsDEZrOLD" alt="singular.webp"></code></p>
<p>In practice, this is the number one thing that we see kill Rails apps under heavy load. Rarely is it an actual DDOS attack; more often, it's a credential stuffing attack or a bad bot that is hammering a site, pushing up autoscaling that's then exhausting database connections, which causes the app to fall over.</p>
<p><code><img src="https://cdn.buttercms.com/kjwGl08yRwiwjX9GLdrp" alt="distributed.webp"></code></p>
<p>Flipping this to a system where an SQLite DB is synced down to each compute instance solves this problem excellently by keeping all the calls local to the new compute instance.</p>
<h2>But what about writes?</h2>
<p>We started this article by discussing splitting the app into a read (rule evaluation) and write (reporting) path and then studiously ignored the write path.</p>
<p>We did rearchitect the write path to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Async connects to Wafris Hub for reporting</li>
<li>Batch sending of the reports</li>
<li>Completely removing database writes from the clients</li>
</ul>
<p>Which will work for approximately 0% of everybody else, but we don't care about them.</p>
<p>We care about the 100% of our users who want the Wafris client to be easy to deploy and stupid fast.</p>
<p>It's hard to know if there's a lesson you can learn from reading all of this, but we sincerely appreciate you taking the time.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>First: thanks to <a href="https://x.com/aarondfrancis" rel="follow">Aaron Francis</a>, <a href="https://x.com/tnorthcutt" rel="follow">Travis Northcutt</a>,&nbsp; <a href="https://brianhogg.com/">Brian Hogg</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/dceddia.com">Dave Ceddia</a>, <a href="https://push.cx/">Peter Bhat Harkins</a> and <a href="https://x.com/natebosscher?lang=en">Nate Bosscher</a> for their feedback and suggestions on this post.</p>
<p>Second: we're exceedingly happy with our v2 architecture, which uses SQLite. It's already helped many sites weather attacks and stay online.</p>
<p>It's much easier to get going, with less support work for us and less hassle for users, which we think is a win for a safer, more secure internet.</p>

<p>A new law in California will make it easier for consumers to cancel their streaming subscriptions and similar products when they enroll in automatic renewal of those services.</p>
<p>The law, passed through Assembly Bill (AB) 2863, will require companies that offer automatic subscription renewals through one-click purchases to also offer customers a way to cancel their subscriptions through the same one-click method.</p>
<p>California already had one of the toughest subscription cancellation laws in the country, requiring companies to offer a way to cancel a recurring subscription through the Internet if they allowed customers to sign up for a service that way.</p>
<p>The initial law was meant to prevent companies from allowing customers to purchase a subscription through the web, while forcing them to call a hotline to cancel them. Consumer advocacy groups complained that companies would often subject customers to frustrating long wait times on the phone with the hope that they would eventually hang up without cancelling their service.</p>
<p>While the law was good in theory, it contained at least one loophole: Companies were in compliance as long as they offered a way for customers to cancel their subscriptions online, but could make them click several links or visit several webpages with opt-in requirements before a cancellation request was processed.</p>
<p>Soon, companies will have to offer easier, one-click cancellation methods if they allow customers to purchase a subscription using a one-click technique. The new law takes effect on January 1, 2025, and would cover purchases and contracts entered into from the following July.</p>
<p>The bill’s co-author, Assembly Member Pilar Schiavo, said the goal of AB 2863 was to help Californians save money at a time when subscription costs were adding up.</p>
<p>“California is setting a model for the nation on protecting consumers from unnecessary charges, giving them more control over their finances and helping to ensure fair business practices, providing a win for both consumers and small businesses,” Schiavo said on Tuesday. “I’m grateful that this important legislation was signed, as it will mean more money in the pockets of people throughout our community.”</p>
<p>The measure will have a significant impact on companies with digital products that allow customers to purchase subscription-based services using one-click tools. Companies like Roku, Amazon and Apple already allow users of their streaming hardware to purchase and cancel subscription using one-click techniques.</p>
<p>Some digital newspaper outlets, fitness clubs, software developers and other services allow customers to purchase subscriptions through a one-click button, but still require filling out a form or navigating through several web pages before they process a cancellation.</p>
<p>Those days are about to come to an end, warned the Consumer Federation of California (CFC), an advocacy group that backed the proposal.</p>
<p>“Consumers have had it with pocketbook-sucking subscriptions where it is almost impossible to cancel,” Robert Herrell, the Executive Director of CFC, said on Tuesday. “It should be as simple to get out of a subscription as it is to get into one. This is simple common-sense and California now has the most comprehensive law in the nation on this topic. From software subscriptions to gym memberships to a wine club, consumers should have easy control of their subscriptions.”</p>

<p>Dialrhea is a modified rotary phone that has been repurposed to control the classic first-person shooter game Doom via Bluetooth. We built it in two days during the “Internet Of Shit” hackathon organized by Technarium crew in Vilnius, Lithuania. The theme of this hackathon was to build devices that are completely useless, but fully functional. Here is Dialrhea in action:</p>

<p>During the same weekend we also made a “slick” promotional video demonstrating capabilities of this revolutionary shitty machine.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2>
<p>I would like to host a workshop where we would build at least three more devices, and then play a Doom death match using these devices. Ideal setting would be some hacker camp or similar event. If you have ideas how to make it happen, drop me a line.</p>
<h2 id="the-story">The Story</h2>
<p>The device was built during “Internet Of Shit” hackathon. It’s an amazing event that was hosted by Technarium crew in Vilnius, Lithuania in 2017 and 2018. Award categories included the likes of “Fire Means It’s Working”, “Least Private On-line Gadget”, “This is Likely Illegal”, and the teams were competing hard to turn these concepts into a working piece of technology.</p>
<p>Our device won the “Least Shitty project” award, and we were also awarded the “Public Prize” for the most popular project. It is worth mentioning that the prize was a rubber drainage cleaning pump sprayed with gold paint.</p>
<p>The ingenious idea was generated after a few beers with Donatas Valiulis and Džiugas Bartkus. The tree of us carried out the whole operation with me and Donatas taking care of technical aspects and Džiugas responsible for video production and promotional materials.</p>
<p>Džiugas also made a nice trippy video about the making of the device and the whole hackathon in general.</p>

      </p></div>
    
<p>There were lots of other absurd projects built during the event, if you are interested, 
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujuv8Wm4F8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here is the full one hour long presentation</a>
   of all projects of “Internet of Shit 2017” including Dialrhea.</p>
<h2 id="appearances">Appearances</h2>
<p>In addition to the hackathon, the device was also a guest of honor in numerous events including Maker Faire 2017 at The Energy and Technology Museum, No Trolls Allowed hacker camp, Vilnius Tech Park birthday, Braille Satellite music festival and others.</p>
<h3 id="vilnius-tech-park-birthday-2018">Vilnius Tech Park birthday 2018</h3>
<p>I spent quite some time in a co-working space in a newly opened Sapiegos Tech Park, a start-up / scale-up infested complex of old hospital buildings in a middle of a beautiful park in the center of the city. An amazing place where I met a lot of interesting people, attended many events and heard a tons of interesting business ideas being pitched near the kitchen sink. When Sapiegos Tech Park celebrated their second birthday I offered to fire up Dialrhea as an interactive installation.</p>

<p>There were many interesting people from business and tech world there. In a picture above you can see well known Lithuanian entrepreneur Valdas Lašas testing out Dialrhea and enjoying it. Unfortunately, he didn’t end up investing in this revolutionary shitty machine, probably because being old-school he didn’t understand how to use this high tech gadget properly and instinctively tried putting the phone to his ear, which obviously gained no results.</p>
<h3 id="braille-satellite-music-festival-2018">Braille Satellite music festival 2018</h3>
<p>On the other side of the spectrum was Dialrhea’s appearance in the Braille Satellite music festival. Taking place in an amazing Mushroom Manor in a middle of Lithuanian countryside it’s a small and cozy festival for the weirder side of electronic music.</p>

<p>Instead of entrepreneurs this time Dialrhea was battle tested with a bunch of ravers, hipsters, musicians and people who haven’t slept for three days.</p>
<h2 id="technical-details">Technical details</h2>
<p>The device is built on Arduino, and uses Bluetooth LE to communicate to the computer wirelessly. It presents itself as bluetooth keyboard and can be paired with any device supporting Bluetooth LE. Below you can see the breakdown of components powering Dialrhea.</p>
<p>
      <img src="https://tamulaitis.lt/images/dialrhea/dialrhea-insides.webp" alt="Insides of Dialrhea">
    </p>
<p>Although the ultimate use case for the device ended up being playing Doom, device actually has full support for multiple modes of operation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Doom</strong> - in this mode the device acts as a game controller, and is configured to control classic Doom game (using Doomsday Engine)</li>
<li><strong>Emoji</strong> - this mode is best used with mobile phones and allows you to type emoji’s and send them to your friends</li>
<li><strong>Boring</strong> - in this mode Dialrhea just outputs the dialed numbers (not recommended)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="reading-data-from-rotary-dial">Reading data from rotary dial</h3>
<p>The most interesting learning during the process was how the rotary dial actually works from technical point of view. I am from the generation who still remember using rotary phones so it was really interesting to understand both how simple the mechanism actually is and why I was getting electric shock while touching phone wires and playing phone mechanic only sometimes and not all the time. If you are interested 
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLGd6OB8D5k" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here is the video explaining the mechanism</a>
  .</p>

        </p>
      
    </div>
  
<p>After understanding how the mechanism works implementing it with Arduino was pretty much straight forward and I don’t remember having any major troubles with it.</p>
<h3 id="fighting-bluetooth">Fighting bluetooth</h3>
<p>Probably the biggest challenge was to make bluetooth communication work properly. We chose to use 
    <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-the-adafruit-bluefruit-le-uart-friend" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adafruit Bluefruit LE UART Friend</a>
   module for the job just because I had it lying around and also I already tried to work with it while working on another project. It is a very capable module, but most problems we had were around stability and reliability. Sometimes things worked well, sometimes we were getting some errors running exactly the same code. We read lots of documentation about how to follow proper handshake protocols, do pairing correctly, etc., but then ended up just adding retry loops and timeouts everywhere so the chip has time to “come to it’s senses” after each risky operation. You can see full source code for Dialrhea below.</p>

<p>There is actually a very interesting bug in this device that allows player to “leap” forward very quickly. I have seen it happening several times, usually after somebody was frantically bashing the device for a while. I literally have no idea why it happens or how to reproduce it, but I actually find it really cool, so I decided to just leave it in and call it a feature.</p>
<h2 id="doom">Doom</h2>
<p>It is no coincidence that classic Doom was chosen as a subject to be controlled by Dialrhea. I absolutely love the game and was obsessed by it while growing up. My father brought it back from his work one day in like 10 floppy disks. I had to learn how to write custom <code>autoexec.bat</code> and <code>config.sys</code> files and boot the system up from special floppy disk containing minimal version of MS-DOS and highly optimized mouse driver so there is just enough memory to run Doom on my Intel 386 33Mhz machine that only had 4Mb of RAM if I remember correctly. <code>"LH A:\MOUSE.COM"</code> was the magic line that told DOS to load mouse driver into otherwise unreachable high memory therefore winning some additional kilobytes of RAM for Doom.</p>

    </div>
  
<p>Apparently I was not the only one obsessed by Doom, many years later that I found out that Doom and it’s creators “id Software” actually redefined the PC gaming market and were first to introduce shareware distribution model successfully. At one point more personal computers had Doom than Windows 95 operating system installed. There is a great book 
    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Masters-Doom-Created-Transformed-Culture/dp/0812972155" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Masters of Doom” by David Kushner</a>
   that tells the story of “id Software” with lots of incredible details, highly recommended read. 
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGdkm780730" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This YouTube video</a>
   also paints quite a nice picture about the innovation and drama inside “id Software”. I still think that Doom is the best game that was ever released.</p>
<h2 id="doom-running-on-everything">Doom running on everything</h2>
<p>One more reason to choose Doom to be controlled with rotary phone was that Doom is notorious for being able to run on pretty much any hardware. Well, actually crazy Doom fans are notorious for making Doom run on pretty much any hardware. Doom was made to run on calculators, microwaves, treadmills, traffic ticket validators, vapes and even pregnancy tests! If the device has a CPU and the screen, there will be some geek trying to run Doom on that machine. Subreddit 
    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/itrunsdoom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">r/itrunsdoom</a>
   has the most impressive collection of devices running Doom that I’ve seen so far.</p>
<p>
      <img src="https://tamulaitis.lt/images/dialrhea/doom-running-on-everything.webp#full-width" alt="Doom running on everything">
    </p>
<p>One of the more interesting projects was one guy 
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFDlVgBMomQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">running Doom on scientific calculator powered by ~800 potatoes</a>
  ! Yes, potatoes! Compared to this our Dialrhea project doesn’t seem so crazy.</p>
<h2 id="competition">Competition</h2>
<p>Apparently we were not the only ones willing to waste our time building ridiculous machine like this. Good five years after our attempt somewhere in Japan the guy named Yoshino built similar device. I have to admit his marketing campaign was way more successful than ours and the video went viral, being covered by major gaming outlets like PC Gamer, IGN and others and even provoking a tweet from John Romero (one of the people who created original Doom) himself.</p>
<p>
      <img src="https://tamulaitis.lt/images/dialrhea/john-romero-tweet.webp#padding-on-mobile" alt="John Romero's tween about rotary phone">
    </p>
<p>Compared to Dialrhea, Yoshino’s device doesn’t utilize handset at all forcing you to dial <code>1</code> to shoot (which is way less fun than frantically mashing the handset). Also you need to connect it to the computer via cable while Dialrhea is fully wireless and supports Bluetooth LE. Just another example how technologically superior solution doesn’t always win the market, marketing does.</p>

<p>Ever since I saw <a href="https://elementary.io/">elementary os</a> sporting the very legible
<a href="https://rsms.me/inter/">Inter</a> font for its UI and site, I wanted to make it part 
of my desktop too. The only problem was any font I'd choose got a little blurry. 
Not any more!</p>

<p>Open up <code>/etc/environment</code> and then add the following line to the end of it.</p>

<pre><code>FREETYPE_PROPERTIES="cff:no-stem-darkening=0 autofitter:no-stem-darkening=0"
</code></pre>

<p>This enables <a href="https://freetype.org/freetype2/docs/hinting/text-rendering-general.html">stem-darkening</a> for
all fonts. This just makes fonts a little bit bolder on smaller screens. This makes 
a heck of a difference for Inter.</p>

<p>Reboot your machine and enjoy beautiful fonts.</p>

<p>Here's a before</p>
