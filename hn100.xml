					<h3>November 15, 2024</h3>
					<p>November has sucked so far. One upside of the terrible nonsense is that more people are fleeing X. Many are choosing Bluesky. I’ve seen a bunch of takes about this recently, but I keep seeing things I disagree with. I figure that’s a good enough excuse to write more about this weird-assed social network.</p>

<h3 id="decentralized-federated-neither">Decentralized? Federated? Neither.</h3>

<p>When writing about Bluesky, I’ve seen folks mention that it’s  either federated or decentralized. I’m here to tell you that it’s currently neither. This one really irks me because the service is getting the credit for work it hasn’t done.</p>

<p>One problem here is that the whole “decentralized” thing is complicated. I believe the Bluesky team is putting in a lot of good-faith effort to becoming a decentralized platform. But, this work is tricky because their architectural choices are quite&nbsp;novel.</p>

<p><a href="https://anderegg.ca/2024/10/21/thoughts-on-the-recent-migration-from-x-to-bluesky">As I’ve written previosuly</a>, the AT Protocol (atproto) that powers Bluesky is <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/docs/advanced-guides/federation-architecture">really complex</a>. It’s made up of three main parts: Personal Data Servers (PDSs), Relays, and App Views.</p>

<p>Currently people can set up their own <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/docs/advanced-guides/federation-architecture#relay">PDSs</a>, which will host both their identity’s signing keys and their content on Bluesky. Setting this up requires a fair amount of server-level knowledge, but it’s relatively cheap (maybe $15/month USD) and lets people control their own data. This is kind of like hosting your own website. The content will be available if someone knows how to get to it. By default, it’s just some stuff sitting on a server somewhere.</p>

<p>The PDS part of the stack is interesting to me. In Bluesky’s view, it’s great if people start hosting their own PDSs — it means they don’t have to pay for people’s content storage!  It also means that users can relocate their data at any time. This is something that ActivityPub should do better. That said: yes, it’s a bit of a pain to move my data from one Mastodon server to another, but it’s something that’s currently possible. The only server that’s actively reading PDSs and doing anything productive with them is the one Bluesky controls. More on this in a second.</p>

<p>Next up the chain are <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/docs/advanced-guides/federation-architecture#relay">Relays</a>. These are what gather data from PDSs and make it available to the atproto ecosystem. If a PDS is like a website, a Relay is like Google. Relays constantly look at PDSs to see if there’s any new content, and then index that content so it’s actually useful. The trouble with this is that it’s expensive and there’s <strong>a lot</strong> of data. I recently <a href="https://alice.bsky.sh/post/3laega7icmi2q">read an interesting post</a> outlining the steps required to self-host Bluesky content. The author mentions that setting up a Relay requires <a href="https://alice.bsky.sh/post/3laega7icmi2q#:~:text=make%20sure%20you%20have%20at%20least%20~4.5%20TB%20of%20disk%20space">around 4.5 TB of disk space</a>, and that it’s <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/alice.mosphere.at/post/3laewhb55zp2v">growing by around 18 GB a day</a>. However, that was said before the most recent bump in growth. The data and processing requirements will only accelerate as more people use the service.</p>

<p>While the Relay aggregates the data, it doesn’t do anything to display it to users. That’s up to the <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/docs/advanced-guides/federation-architecture#relay">App View</a>, which is what most people think of as “Bluesky”. This is the piece that pulls out data that has been scraped by a Relay and turns it into something useful. In the case of Bluesky —&nbsp;the social network —&nbsp;it’s about showing you posts from people you follow, not showing you stuff from people you’ve blocked, and notifying you of people who’ve mentioned you. The idea here is that this part could be replaced with something that isn’t a social network, and could be used for just about anything. The problem is that it’s currently extremely loosely defined, and also <a href="https://alice.bsky.sh/post/3laega7icmi2q#:~:text=documented%20here.-,AppView,-The%20elephant%20in">hasn’t been implemented by anyone else</a>.</p>

<p>There are two other things that are directly under Bluesky’s control: the <a href="https://github.com/did-method-plc/did-method-plc">DID:PLC</a> and <a href="https://anderegg.ca/2024/05/23/digging-into-bluesky-dms">DMs</a>. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> are an open standard to allow people to identify things in a distributed way. However, the PLC method that Bluesky uses is currently under their control. It was <a href="https://github.com/did-method-plc/did-method-plc/blob/0e8370fc1e616e6f1f76f8b8c445d6dfe8e95f04/README.md">previously known as the “placeholder” method</a>, because they intended to get away from it as soon as they could build something decentralized. Instead, they (I think wisely) decided to stick with it for the meantime. However, if you want to look up a DID:PLC, you need to query the Bluesky servers. This is important because every user is identified by a DID:PLC, and all interactions need to reference them.</p>

<p>Similarly, <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/blog/2024-protocol-roadmap#:~:text=Basic%20%22Off%2DProtocol%22%20Direct%20Messages%20%28DMs%29">DMs are currently handled outside of atproto</a>. They’re not part of the atproto spec, and need to go through Bluesky’s servers. I’m not sure how or when these will be updated.</p>

<p>All this to say: the Bluesky team seems like they’re earnestly working toward a decentralized platform, but they have a lot of work ahead of them. Years of effort, in my estimation. In the meantime, Bluesky is slightly more decentralized than, say, Facebook —&nbsp;but not by much. Yes, you can host your own data. Yes, you can scrape all of the content on the network. But you can’t do anything with it unless you’re attached to the Bluesky service. I believe this will change with time, but it will be prohibitively expensive and we’re not there yet.</p>

<p>I’ll also add that the reason I’m a big fan of a ActivityPub solution like Mastodon is that it’s <a href="https://masto.host/pricing/">quite inexpensive</a> to run your own complete stack unless you’re extremely famous. Hosting a Mastodon instance is a one-step process, and you then control everything. To get the same experience with atproto, you’ll need to spend hundreds or thousands of dollars a month, and even then you still don’t control everything as of today.</p>

<h3 id="radically-open">Radically open</h3>

<p>I think some might be surprised to learn how open Bluesky is. It’s trivially easy to <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/blog/repo-export">grab an export of any user’s data</a>. It’s also a core assumption of the service that all the data (aside from out-of-protocol stuff like DMs) is completely open. You can watch the <a href="https://firesky.tv/">firehose of data</a> go by if you’d like. If you want to run a Relay, you have to download all the data. This is because the data in the network is all <a href="https://atproto.com/specs/repository">cryptographically signed based on what came before it</a>. The protocol does this using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree">Merkle tree structure</a>, which is also how Git stores data. The issue with this is: if you want to look at one piece of content in the system, you also need to know about everything that happened before. For people using the Bluesky service, this isn’t something you need to think about. But behind the scenes, it’s helpful to know that everything being added to the service could potentially be available for anyone else to use for any purpose.</p>

<h3 id="financial-concerns">Financial concerns</h3>

<p>Bluesky is currently free to use, and I think they intend it to stay that way. This is easier when there are fewer users, and I’d bet that the technical choices discussed above make things more expensive to run. The CEO, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Graber">Jay Graber</a>, seems like a smart person who’s trying to do the right thing. However, she’s also someone with a background in the crypto industry who <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/10-24-2024-series-a">recently accepted funding lead by a crypto investor</a>. What does that mean for the service? Who knows! But it doesn’t sound great to me. Investors like to make returns. Bluesky is currently only making money by <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/7-05-2023-namecheap">reselling domains for usernames</a>. That’s not exactly a high-margin business.</p>

<h3 id="small-things">Small things</h3>

<p>The above pieces are things I worry about, but I’m pretty sure I’m in the minority. Most people don’t care about decentralization or even if their content is being scraped. I can’t imagine they care how the service is being paid for. But here are two nitpicks I’ll add here that I think are more product-level: repost control and post editing.</p>

<p>On Mastodon and Twitter-of-old, I was able to follow a user, but only see posts from them. Many people hit the repost button a lot, and overwhelm my feed. I’d love the ability to selectively disable reposts from a user without having to build a custom feed to do so.</p>

<p>Also, it would be great to edit posts! I believe this is tricky because of the Merkle tree structure mentioned above, but it’s a pain these days when every other platform has the feature.</p>

<h3 id="good-things">Good things</h3>

<p>Now that I’ve gotten some grumpiness out of my system, I would like to recognise some legitimately great things that Bluesky is doing. First up, domain-based usernames.</p>

<p>You can follow me on Bluesky as <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gavin.anderegg.ca">@gavin.anderegg.ca</a>. I was able to set this up easily by <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/4-28-2023-domain-handle-tutorial">adding a TXT record to my domain that links to my DID:PLC</a>. This is great! It allows me to effectively “blue check” myself, in a <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/verification">similar way to Mastodon</a>. The domain-based approach is quite flexible, and I think it’s a great solution.</p>

<p>Bluesky also offers both <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/4-13-2023-moderation">composable moderation</a> and the ability to <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/7-27-2023-custom-feeds">choose your own algorithm</a>. I’m someone who just wants to see a chronological feed of posts from the folks I follow, but I absolutely understand the appeal of these features. It’s made especially clear when compared to Threads, which only wants to show me <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/7/24264382/threads-engagement-bait-problem-mosseri-meta">inane engagement bait</a> by default. There are even some <a href="https://www.southernfriedscience.com/a-quick-and-dirty-guide-to-making-custom-feeds-on-bluesky/">third-party services</a> which make setting up your own custom feed easier.</p>

<p>I also really love the idea of <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/06-26-2024-starter-packs">starter packs</a>. If you’re someone who’s joining the service, picking who you want to follow is rough. A starter pack lets you to follow a set of users recommended by someone you trust. Anyone can create a starter pack, so it’s easy to grab a few and have a lively feed a few moments after joining.</p>

<h3 id="everyones-experience-is-different">Everyone’s experience is different</h3>

<p>As people are fleeing X, I’ve seen a lot of thoughts from people about engagement. I’m on Mastodon, Bluesky, and Threads. On each network, I’ve seen a post like, “I joined and I’ve got more engagement here than anywhere else”. I’m certain that’s true for that person, but I think this is so variable as to be useless.</p>

<p>I joined Mastodon in late 2022, along with the <a href="https://www.relay.fm/">Relay</a>, <a href="https://atp.fm/">ATP</a>, and <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">Daring Fireball</a> crowd. I get a lot of engagement on Mastodon! I’m also a white guy who cares too much about expensive technology. Bluesky seems to be winning with artists and random local groups. I <a href="https://anderegg.ca/2024/10/21/thoughts-on-the-recent-migration-from-x-to-bluesky">mentioned this before</a>, but my new city councillor <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/lecwhite.bsky.social">campaigned on Bluesky</a> and it was to her credit!</p>

<p>I bring this up because I think different social networks might “fit” better for some than others. I’ve seen Bluesky described as having “<a href="https://www.garbageday.email/p/bluesky-s-the-new-twitter-probably#:~:text=that%20Bluesky%20had%20%E2%80%9C-,theater%20kid%20energy,-.%E2%80%9D%20%28He%E2%80%99s%20not%20exactly">theater kid energy</a>”, which, heck, I’m here for! Others have said Mastodon has a “<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-tried-replacing-twitter-with-bluesky-threads-and-mastodon-heres-what-i-found/#:~:text=joining%20a%20Mastodon%20server%20feels%20a%20lot%20like%20joining%20a%20homeowner%27s%20association">homeowner’s association</a>” vibe. I haven’t personally felt that, but I recognise that the content warnings and block lists can give that impression.</p>

<h3 id="maybe-bluesky-has-won">Maybe Bluesky has “won”</h3>

<p>I don’t know what the social media landscape will look like in 6 months, but I’d bet things will change. If Bluesky comes out as a “winner” and more posting happens there, I think I’m generally fine with that. At least for now.</p>

<p>The whole Twitter mess has taught me not to attach myself too closely with these things anymore. I hung on far too long to Twitter while it made me feel terrible. My goal going forward is to post more to my own site and aggregate to any social channel I currently care about. I’m happy to interact on any that I’m a part of, but I’m also going to be much quicker to pull the ripcord if things start going down hill.</p>

<p><strong>Freezing Solid</strong></p>
<p>The most remarkable thing about wood frogs happens not in the summer when they transform from tadpoles to frogs, but in the winter when they hibernate.</p>
<p>The northern forests of Alaska and Canada have some of the most dramatic temperature ranges in the world. Summer days stretch to 24 hours and temperatures can climb into the 90’s. Winter brings some of the earth’s coldest temperatures: it is not unusual to have temperatures of minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit. Prospect Creek, just south of the Brooks Range, had the coldest temperature ever recorded in Alaska—minus 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Almost certainly, there were hibernating wood frogs near Prospect Creek when that record was set.</p>
<p>This is the winter world in which the wood frog must survive. Remember, frogs are cold blooded, so their body temperature is about the same as the surrounding air. How do these delicate little creatures endure the intense, protracted, iron-cold subarctic winter?</p>
<p>This mystery has intrigued scientists for a long time. Biologists have studied wood frog hibernation and what they’ve learned is truly astonishing.</p>
<p>Most frogs survive northern winters by hibernating deep under water, in ponds, lakes and streams—they are cold and dormant but their body temperature never falls below freezing.</p>
<p>Wood frogs have a different strategy. They hibernate by nestling down into the leafy litter on the forest floor. The leaves, duff and overlying snow give some insulation from extreme cold, but the frogs are not protected from subfreezing temperatures as they would be if they chose the underwater strategy.</p>
</div><div id="cs_control_1008228">
<p>Researchers have found that wood frogs spend the winter frozen! This amazing strategy allows wood frogs to become active very early in spring, because the land thaws and warms more quickly than the ice-covered lakes The newly active frogs can mate and lay eggs in small ponds and even in melt water pools that dry up by midsummer. By contrast, frogs that hibernate underwater take longer to become active, so they must breed later. These frogs need permanent water that won’t dry out.</p>
<p>For most other animals, survival depends on protecting themselves from any condition that could freeze their flesh. Why is freezing so dangerous? Several things can happen: If ice crystals form inside an animal they can puncture blood vessels. When blood freezes, there is no mechanism to deliver oxygen and nutrients to organs, so extreme metabolic damage occurs. And ice severely injures cells by drawing out water and causing dehydration, scrambling the interior structure of cells and fracturing the cell walls. The result is pervasive and deadly internal damage.</p>
</div><div id="cs_control_1008230">
<p>Yet wood frogs have evolved ways to freeze solid for up to eight months each year. They’ve accomplished what would seem to be a biological miracle. How do they pull this off?</p>
<p>At the beginning of winter, ice quickly fills the wood frog’s abdominal cavity and encases the internal organs. Ice crystals form between layers of skin and muscle. The eyes turn white because the lens freezes.</p>
<p>At the same time, the wood frog’s liver produces large amounts of glucose that flushes into every cell in its body. This syrupy sugar solution prevents the cells from freezing and binds the water molecules inside the cells to prevent dehydration.</p>
<p>So on the one hand, the wood frog’s body allows ice to form around the <em>outsides</em> of cells and organs; and on the other hand, it prevents ice from forming <em>inside</em> the cells--thus avoiding the lethal damage suffered by most animals when they freeze.</p>
<p>What does a hibernating wood frog look like? There is no muscle movement. No heartbeat. No breathing. For the entire winter, the wood frog is like a lump of hard, frigid, icy stone carved in the shape of a frog. But it’s alive, in a state of suspended animation.</p>
<p>In spring, the wood frog thaws from the inside outward. First the heart starts beating. Then the brain activates. Finally, the legs move.</p>
<p>Nobody yet understands what starts the wood frog’s heart after being frozen and inert for the entire northern winter. Once the frog is fully thawed, it heads off through the woods to find a breeding pond or other suitable water.</p>
<p>The wood frog is completely undamaged by conditions that would be fatal to nearly all other animals.</p>
</div><div id="cs_control_1008244">
<p><span color="#000000"><strong><span><strong><span><strong><span><strong>Wood Frogs and Humans</strong></span></strong></span></strong></span></strong></span></p>
<p>Glucose in the wood frog's blood keeps it from freezing during the extreme arctic winter temperatures. This is the same as the blood sugar in all vertebrate animals, including humans.</p>
<p>Hibernating wood frogs can tolerate blood sugar levels 100 times higher than normal without the damage suffered by human diabetics when their blood sugar is only 2 to 10 times above normal. Understanding how frogs can do this might provide valuable knowledge to help in the management of high blood sugar in people with diabetes.</p>
<p>Also, the wood frog's ability to withstand freezing may help researchers discover how human organs used for transplants could be frozen and thawed without damage. This would increase the allowable time between removing an organ from a donor and implanting it within the recipient, which could make many more transplants possible.</p>
<p>Researchers are also interested in how the wood frog's body can stop blood circulation and start it again many months later without blood clots or other injuries. Understanding the mechanism which allows this could be valuable for treating people after their blood flow is temporarily halted by heart attack or stroke.</p>

    <p>Let’s talk about tech interviews – specifically, the ones that go overboard with unrealistic coding assignments. If you’re a developer who’s been asked to debug legacy PHP or build a mini-app from scratch in just a few hours, you know what I’m talking about. It’s becoming a trend, and it’s not helping anyone.</p>
<h2 id="unrealistic-tests-that-dont-measure-real-skills">Unrealistic Tests That Don’t Measure Real Skills</h2><p>These high-stress, solo coding assignments don’t reflect the actual job. Instead, they put developers in situations they’d never face in the workplace, where collaboration and support are standard. When was the last time you had to debug an ancient codebase without documentation or help from a team? Yet companies claim this somehow measures “problem-solving” skills.</p>
<p>What companies often ignore is the extra time candidates invest beyond the “suggested time” for these tests. Developers don’t just jump into an assignment; they research the company, study the job requirements, and meticulously work to polish the project. A “4-hour” assignment can quickly turn into 8, 10, or even more, just to ensure it’s in great shape. For developers balancing jobs and life, this can feel like working unpaid shifts for a job they don’t even have yet.</p>
<h2 id="the-flexibility-myth">The Flexibility Myth</h2><p>Many companies justify these tests by saying they need “adaptable” developers, even if the tech stack has nothing to do with the role. This is like asking a Ruby developer to debug PHP as a test of flexibility. Sure, adaptability is important, but that doesn’t mean a candidate’s worth should be based on their ability to tackle obscure, unrelated challenges.</p>
<h2 id="are-companies-testing-candidates-or-just-flexing">Are Companies Testing Candidates or Just Flexing?</h2><p>For some companies, these tests feel like a way to show off how “elite” their standards are rather than truly evaluating fit. There’s an inflated “top 1%” mentality where every hire has to jump through hoops, even if those hoops don’t make sense. This turns away skilled candidates who could do the job well but don’t thrive in these artificial, high-pressure situations.</p>
<h2 id="time-for-a-reality-check">Time for a Reality Check</h2><p>It’s time for companies to admit these interview practices are broken. If the job requires specific tech skills, test those skills. But don’t put candidates through unrealistic coding boot camps that don’t reflect the role’s actual needs.</p>
<p>Hiring processes should focus on problem-solving, collaboration, and growth in relevant areas. Unrealistic expectations don’t attract the best talent – they just exhaust and discourage it. If companies want adaptable developers, they should focus on the long-term ability to learn, not how fast someone can tackle an arbitrary test. Dropping these absurd assignments and focusing on what really counts could foster a better, more inclusive tech culture.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/fishermen-hunting-for-halibut-caught-a-us-nuclear-sub/">https://www.vice.com/en/article/fishermen-hunting-for-halibut-caught-a-us-nuclear-sub/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42147675">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


<p>Some Norwegian fishermen off the coast of Tromsø were out and about on their vessel named Øygutt looking for halibut. Something significantly larger than fish, however, found its way into their trawl net. The fishermen <a href="https://www.thebarentsobserver.com/security/norwegian-fishermen-snagged-us-nuclearpowered-submarine/420357?ICID=ref_fark">caught the USS Virginia</a>, a 115-meter-long nuclear-powered attack submarine outfitted with cruise missiles.</p>





<p>The ship’s crew, made up entirely of young men in their 20s, had no idea that the USS Virginia had been dragging its net for two nautical miles before its crew realized what was going on and cut it loose. </p>

<p>

<p>The USS Virginia, a US naval ship, was sailing near the surface when its propeller snagged a part of the fishing net. The fishermen were unaware of it until they were contacted by the US Coast Guard. They were on the way to a new spot hoping to catch more halibut, all the while blissfully ignorant to the fact that their net was now being dragged away by the setting for several excellent ’90s military thrillers.</p>







<p>The US Embassy in Oslo later confirmed the incident and that the submarine was operating in the area. The U.S. Navy uses the waters around Norway as a hub for resupply and crew changes in NATO’s ongoing surveillance of Russian naval activities. </p>



<p>Russian subs are regularly deployed from the Kola Peninsula in the northern Atlantic in the United States and NATO has a vested interest in understanding what the Russkies are up to with their super silent modern submarines. Hopefully, all these wargames can keep the fishermen out of it — which is apparently rather difficult.</p>



<p>You see, this isn’t the first time this has happened. A quick Google search brought up an article archived by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/20/world/soviet-submarine-is-trapped-by-norwegian-fishing-wire.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New York Times</a>, seemingly originally published by UPI, titled “Soviet Submarine Is Trapped By Norwegian Fishing Wire.” The article dates back to June 20, 1984.</p>







<p>The short blurb tells the story of a Soviet sub trapped in the fishing wire of a Norwegian trawler for 3 ½ hours. The lesson here is that as long as the US and Russia are butting heads, Norwegian fishing boats will always get caught in the middle. Keep your Cold War the hell away from innocent Norwegian fishermen!</p>

In addition, of course, the campaigns also served as mechanisms for the promulgation of censorship and suppression, including of free speech and the dissemination of knowledge.

Indeed, the origins of Deutsche Physik can be traced back to war atrocities committed by German soldiers during World War I, and the public denial of those acts by 93 prominent but misled German intellectuals (12 of whom were already Nobel laureates, two of whom later would be and six of whom were Jewish or of Jewish descent).</span></p><p><span>Consider this a warning story about the dangers of politicizing knowledge and the </span><em>“relative ease with which the internal conventions of science could be abrogated by mobilizing political passions”</em><span> (Wolff, 2003).</span></p><p>Following Austria’s declaration of war on Serbia, the German government sent an ultimatum to Belgium on August 2nd 1914 demanding passage through the country despite its neutrality. Two days later, the Belgium government refused the German demands with the backing of the British government which guaranteed military support. The German government responded by declaring war on August 4th and on the same day, the Imperial German Army crossed the border into Belgium.</p><p>By August 19th about 15,000 troops — including infantry, artillery and cavalry — descended upon the university town of Louvain (or “Leuven”) in Central Belgium. Despite not encountering any resistance from the population, due to a perceived counter-attack, German troops soon began a massacre of murder, pillaging, arson and other war crimes towards the town’s civilian population. Over the course of five days 248 civilians were killed, most of the town’s remaining 10,000 residents exiled, 1,500 deported and some 2,000 homes, including about 1/6th of the town’s structures destroyed. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40e6fbd9-0bd0-4436-9e32-8cb1e176797e_5223x3793.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40e6fbd9-0bd0-4436-9e32-8cb1e176797e_5223x3793.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40e6fbd9-0bd0-4436-9e32-8cb1e176797e_5223x3793.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40e6fbd9-0bd0-4436-9e32-8cb1e176797e_5223x3793.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40e6fbd9-0bd0-4436-9e32-8cb1e176797e_5223x3793.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40e6fbd9-0bd0-4436-9e32-8cb1e176797e_5223x3793.jpeg" width="1456" height="1057" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/40e6fbd9-0bd0-4436-9e32-8cb1e176797e_5223x3793.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1057,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2777122,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40e6fbd9-0bd0-4436-9e32-8cb1e176797e_5223x3793.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40e6fbd9-0bd0-4436-9e32-8cb1e176797e_5223x3793.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40e6fbd9-0bd0-4436-9e32-8cb1e176797e_5223x3793.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40e6fbd9-0bd0-4436-9e32-8cb1e176797e_5223x3793.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Ruins of the university library at Louvain (Photo: Library of Congress)</figcaption></figure></div><p>Among the buildings lost during the atrocities was the Central Hall and University Library of the Katholieke Universiteit te Leuven.

Every German would of course greatly regret if in the course of this terrible war any works of art should already have been destroyed or be destroyed at some future time, but inasmuch as in our great love for art we cannot be surpassed by any other nation, in the same degree we must decidedly refuse to buy a German defeat at the cost of saving a work of art.”</span></em></p></blockquote><p><span>Of the 93 signatories to the text, 21 were natural scientists and four were Solvay Prize winners</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4-143631216" href="https://www.privatdozent.co/p/the-battle-line-at-louvain-1914#footnote-4-143631216" target="_self" rel="">4</a></span><span> (MacLeod, 2018).

The letter, signed 'British Scholars’ opens as follows:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>“We see with regret the names of many German professors and men of science, whom we regard with respect and, in some cases, with personal friendship, appended to a denunciation of Great Britain so utterly baseless that we can hardly believe that it expresses their spontaneous or considered opinion. We do not question for a moment their personal sincerity when they express their horror of war and their zeal for "the achievements of culture." Yet we are bound to point out that a very different view of war, and of national aggrandizement based on the threat of war, has been advocated by such influential writers as Nietzsche, von Treitschke, von Bülow, and von Bernhardi, and has received widespread support from the press and from public opinion in Germany. This has not occurred, and in our judgment would scarcely be possible, in any other civilized country. We must also remark that it is German armies alone which have, at the present time, deliberately destroyed or bombarded such monuments of human culture as the Library at Louvain and the Cathedrals at Rheims and Malines.”</em></p></blockquote><p><span>In proper English fashion, their text ends with the polite expression of their </span><em>“real and deep admiration for German scholarship and science”</em><span>, ending:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>“We have many ties with Germany, ties of comradeship, of respect, and of affection.

For us, as for Belgium, it is a war of defense, waged for liberty and peace.”</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><em>“The ‘two Germanies’ of music and beauty, and of iron and blood were dissolved into one, dominated by war.” — (</em><span>MacLeod, 2018)</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Not all the intellectuals approached by Fulda accepted his invitation to sign the German manifesto, and some who did were not aware of what they were signing. Notably absent was </span><a href="https://www.privatdozent.co/t/Einstein" rel="">Albert Einstein</a><span> (1879-1955), who in 1915 would instead sign his name to a pacifist counter-manifesto referred to as the </span><em>Aufruf an die Europäer</em><span> (“Manifesto of the Europeans”). Another name that was notably absent was prominent mathematician </span><a href="https://www.privatdozent.co/t/Hilbert" rel="">David Hilbert</a><span> (1862-1943), who distrusted Fulda’s motives and refused to sign. This did not go unnoticed by the German propaganda machine, and when Hilbert’s classes at Göttingen resumed in November of 1914, his students turned away from him, as if he were a traitor (Reid, 1970). Among those who later claimed not to know what they were signing were Planck, Fischer and Klein (Wolff, 2003). Planck, for instance, had been traveling and without knowing the formulation of the text authorized his children to sign it on his behalf. Astronomer Wilhelm J. Foerster (1832-1921), whose signature may have been added without his permission, soon rescinded his endorsement and set to work on the “</span><em>Manifesto of the Europeans”</em><span>, which he co-authored with Georg Friedrich Nicolai (1874-1964). Others notable for refusing to sign the manifest was composer Richard Strauss (1864-1949) , who later wrote that </span><em>“declarations about war and politics are not fitting for an artist”</em><span> (Strauss &amp; Rolland, 1968).</span></p><p><span>Among those who did sign the document and remained proud to endorse it was Wilhelm Wien, a renowned German physicist and professor in Würzburg who three years prior had won the Nobel Prize in Physics </span><em>“for his discoveries regarding the laws governing the radiation of heat”</em><span>. Motivated by national and conservative leanings and his perceived failure of </span><em>Manifest der 93</em><span> Wien, in late 1914 he took it upon himself to </span><em>“take a stand against the unbelievable lies from abroad” </em><span>(Wolff, 2003) by drafting a proclamation (“aufforderung”) against the “Englishness” (Engländerei) influencing German physics. The translated text is available in its entirety below:</span></p><pre><code><strong>Proclamation</strong><span>
Because of the war, the relations of physical scientists to enemy countries will undergo revision. This will effect our relationship with England particularly in view of the hostile declaration drafted by English scholars without any understanding of the German mind and signed by eight well-known English physicists (Bragg, Crookes, Fleming, Lamb, Lodge, Ramsay, Rayleigh, J. J. Thomson).

Two lines of the signatures are missing now! It has been demonstrated by their action that the long-standing efforts to reach a better mutual understanding with the English have failed and cannot be resumed in the foreseeable future. The steps we have taken in the interest of a rapprochement between the scientific communities of both peoples are no longer justified. Thus, we must eliminate the unjustified English influence on German physics.

Naturally, this does not mean a rejection of English scientific ideas and suggestions. But the frequently criticized “Ausländerei” of the Germans has become so evident in our science that it appears necessary to draw attention to it. 

On this basis we limit ourselves for now to propose that all physicists observe the following rules:

1. In citing the literature, the English should no longer receive greater consideration than our countrymen, as has happened often in the past;

2. German physicists should no longer publish in English journals, except to respond;

3. Publishers should only accept scientific works written in German and
translations only if, in the opinion of experts, the translated works are particularly important contributions to the literature;

4. Government money is not to be used for translations.

Formulated </span><em>not</em><span> as a counter-manifesto to the British, but rather, as a </span><em>“self-education”</em><span> targeted towards German-speaking physicists, the proclamation was printed in 700 copies which were sent out to German and Austrian universities in March of 1915 (Wolff, 2003).</span></p><p><span>By 1921 a report in The New York Times found that of the 76 surviving signatories to the ‘Manifest der 93’, 60 expressed varying degrees of regret for signing.

Their legacy, tarnished by this support and their pursuit of the “German physics” would later fail and be supplanted by the work of another German physicist, Werner Heisenberg (1901-76) who would go on to employ “Jewish physics” in the German nuclear weapons program, which was initiated in 1939.</p><p><span>To this day, the burning of the library in Louvain remains a battle line, which we should be wary to ever cross again, for as Heinrich Heine (1797-1856) so eloquently once stated,  </span><em>“where they burn books, they will also burn people”.</em></p><div data-component-name="DigestPostEmbed"><a href="https://www.privatdozent.co/p/when-einstein-met-churchill-1933" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_140,h_140,c_fill,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F45eb2334-cdf8-4458-ba9f-8ec404be1c07_651x466.jpeg"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_140,h_140,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F45eb2334-cdf8-4458-ba9f-8ec404be1c07_651x466.jpeg" sizes="100vw" alt="When Einstein met Churchill (1933)" width="140" height="140"></picture></div></a></div><div data-component-name="DigestPostEmbed"><a href="https://www.privatdozent.co/p/einsteins-emigration-to-america-1932" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_140,h_140,c_fill,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35c6b4b6-0051-4180-a3c6-464ea4c8a072_906x698.jpeg"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_140,h_140,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35c6b4b6-0051-4180-a3c6-464ea4c8a072_906x698.jpeg" sizes="100vw" alt="Einstein's Emigration to America (1932)" width="140" height="140"></picture></div></a></div><div data-component-name="DigestPostEmbed"><a href="https://www.privatdozent.co/p/when-heisenberg-met-einstein" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_140,h_140,c_fill,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F59068a3e-4737-4b3d-8660-7c00d84209a5_1456x1021.png"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_140,h_140,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F59068a3e-4737-4b3d-8660-7c00d84209a5_1456x1021.png" sizes="100vw" alt="When Heisenberg met Einstein" width="140" height="140"></picture></div></a></div><p><span>At the time of the writing of this essay, the </span><em>Privatdozent</em><span> newsletter goes out to 11,779 subscribers via Substack.</span></p><p><strong>Derez, M., 2016</strong><span>.

<p dir="auto">Normally Seer will just show the source code as tabs in the Code Manager. The program's assembly can also be show as a tab.</p>
<p dir="auto">Select "View-&gt;Assembly View" and an extra tab will be shown alongside the source code tabs that shows the current assembly being executed. Here is an example.

<p dir="auto">Like the source code tabs, breakpoints can be set in the assembly tab. The current instruction is highlighted.</p>
<p dir="auto">Double-clicking on entries in the "Breakpoints" tab and the "Stack frames" tab will show the assembly for those addresses.</p>
<p dir="auto">There are "Nexti" and "Stepi" hot-keys, as defined by your config settings. Normally "Ctrl+F5" and "CTRL+F6".
Using "^F" in the assembly tab will show a powerful search bar.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’m Maxim Perumal (<a href="https://twitter.com/maxim_xyz" target="_blank">Maxim xyz</a>) and when my best friend Gabriel Combe and I were 15 years old we built our own VR headset because we couldn't afford to buy one. It became Relativty, one of the most popular open-source VR headset.</p></div><div><h2><strong>Make it for $200</strong></h2><p>Relativty is not a consumer product. We made Relativty in my bedroom with a soldering iron and a 3D printer and we expect you to do the same: build it yourself.</p></div><div><h2>Software</h2><div><div><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f57b1e7e28c685a1ffd2900/5f5824ad85ffae60ef35d946_front-700.jpg" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 93vw, (max-width: 736px) 95vw, (max-width: 991px) 700px, 67vw" srcset="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f57b1e7e28c685a1ffd2900/5f5824ad85ffae60ef35d946_front-700-p-500.jpeg 500w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f57b1e7e28c685a1ffd2900/5f5824ad85ffae60ef35d946_front-700.jpg 700w" alt=""></p><h2><strong>Full Steam VR support</strong></h2><p>We started Relativty because after watching Sword Art Online we wanted to make our own VR games.

Precision and freedom of movement are still very far from dedicated sensors, however, we believe that the model can be trained and improved by orders of magnitude.</p></div></div></div><div><h2><strong>Motherboard</strong></h2><p>We designed an affordable motherboard that runs the Relativty Firmware, it is based on the Atmel SAM3X8E ARM Cortex-M3 processor and uses an MPU-6050 as it’s IMU.

From more affordable 90Hz 1080p screen to 4K panels.</p></div></div></div><div><h2>Getting started</h2><p>Relativty is entirely Open-source; we made it to be a testing ground for hackers and developer rather than a product.

<p id="speakable-summary">Apple’s new iPhone software comes with a novel security feature that reboots the phone if it’s not unlocked for 72 hours, according to security researchers.</p>

<p>Last week, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.404media.co/police-freak-out-at-iphones-mysteriously-rebooting-themselves-locking-cops-out/">404 Media reported</a> that law enforcement officers and forensic experts were concerned that some iPhones were rebooting themselves under mysterious circumstances, which made it harder for them to get access to the devices and extract data. Citing security researchers, 404 Media <a href="https://www.404media.co/police-freak-out-at-iphones-mysteriously-rebooting-themselves-locking-cops-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">later reported</a> that iOS 18 had a new “inactivity reboot” feature that forced the devices to restart.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Now we know exactly how long it takes for this feature to kick in.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Jiska Classen, a researcher at the Hasso Plattner Institute and one of the first security experts to spot this new feature, <a href="https://x.com/naehrdine/status/1856802400897503487" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published a video</a> demonstrating the “inactivity reboot” feature. The video shows that an iPhone left alone without being unlocked reboots itself after 72 hours.</p>

<p>Magnet Forensics, a company that provides digital forensic products including the iPhone and Android data extraction tool Graykey, <a href="https://www.magnetforensics.com/blog/understanding-the-security-impacts-of-ios-18s-inactivity-reboot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">also confirmed</a> that the timer for the feature is 72 hours.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Inactivity reboot” effectively puts iPhones in a more secure state by locking the user’s encryption keys in the iPhone’s secure enclave chip.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Even if thieves leave your iPhone powered on for a long time, they won’t be able to unlock it with cheaper, outdated forensic tooling,” Classen wrote on X. “While inactivity reboot makes it more challenging for law enforcement to get data from devices of criminals, this won’t lock them out completely. Three days is still plenty of time when coordinating steps with professional analysts.”</p>

<p>iPhones have two different states that can affect the ability of law enforcement, forensic experts, or hackers, to unlock them by brute-forcing the user’s passcode, or extracting data by exploiting security flaws in the iPhone software. These two states are “Before First Unlock,” or BFU, and “After First Unlock,” or AFU. </p>

<p>When the iPhone is in BFU state, the user’s data on their iPhone is fully encrypted and near-impossible to access, unless the person trying to get in knows the user’s passcode. In AFU state, on the other hand, certain data is unencrypted and may be easier to extract by some device forensic tools — even if the phone is locked.&nbsp;</p>

<p>An iPhone security researcher who goes by Tihmstar told TechCrunch that the iPhones in those two states are also referred to as “hot” or “cold” devices.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Tihmstar said that many forensic companies focus on “hot” devices in an AFU state, because at some point the user entered their correct passcode, which is stored in the memory of the iPhone’s secure enclave. By contrast, “cold” devices are far more difficult to compromise because their memory cannot be easily extracted once the phone restarts.</p>

<p>For years, Apple has added new security features that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/22/the-fbi-is-mad-because-it-keeps-getting-into-locked-iphones-without-apples-help/">law enforcement have opposed and spoken out against</a>, arguing that they are making their job harder. In 2016, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/13/why-apple-is-right-to-resist-the-fbi/">FBI took Apple to court</a> in an effort to force the company to build a backdoor to unlock the iPhone of a mass-shooter. Eventually, the Australian startup Azimuth Security <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/04/14/azimuth-san-bernardino-apple-iphone-fbi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">helped the FBI</a> hack into the phone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Apple did not respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            
                <h2 id="what-pep740">What is PEP 740?</h2>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0740/">PEP 740</a> is a Python standard
                    for defining cryptographically verifiable attestations hosted by indices like
                    PyPI.
                </p>
                <h2 id="what">What are attestations?</h2>
                <p>
                    Attestations are digitally signed, publicly verifiable statements about Python
                    packages, including their <em>provenance</em> (e.g., the exact source repository
                    that produced them).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Attestations are built on top of <a href="https://sigstore.dev/">Sigstore</a>
                    and use short-lived signing keys bound to trusted identities
                    (like <a href="https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/">Trusted Publishers</a>),
                    making them misuse-resistant and less susceptible to key loss and theft.
                </p>
                <h2 id="about-list">What is this list?</h2>
                <p>This site shows the top 360 most-downloaded packages on <a href="https://pypi.org/">PyPI</a> showing which have been uploaded with attestations.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>Green</span> packages <span id="success-percent"></span> with a 🔏 offer attestations for verification</li>
                    <li><span>Uncolored</span> packages <span id="default-percent"></span> with a ⏰ were last uploaded before attestations were available</li>
                    <li><span>Yellow</span> packages <span id="todo-percent"></span> have no attestations uploaded (yet!)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Packages that are known to be deprecated are not included (for example, distribute). If your package is incorrectly listed, please <a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/are-we-pep740-yet/issues/">create a ticket</a>.</p>
                <h2 id="creating-wheels">My package is uncolored. What can I do?</h2>
                <p>
                    Using a Trusted Publisher is the easiest way to enable attestations, since they come baked in!
                    See <a href="https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/adding-a-publisher/">the PyPI user docs</a>
                    and <a href="https://github.com/pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish">official PyPA publishing action</a>
                    to get started.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For projects already using the official PyPA publishing action, you can upgrade to <a href="https://github.com/pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish/releases/tag/v1.11.0">v1.11.0</a> or later
                    to automatically enable attestations for the next release of the project. We recommend upgrading to the latest version of the action to receive any bug fixes.
                </p>
                <h2 id="bugs">Something's wrong with this page!</h2>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://uhoreg.gitlab.io/matrix-tutorial/index.html">https://uhoreg.gitlab.io/matrix-tutorial/index.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42142790">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="main">
<section id="matrix-client-tutorial">

<div>
<p>Warning</p>
<p>This book is a work in progress.  Most of the information that it contains
should be correct, but it is not complete.</p>
</div>
<p>Welcome to the Matrix.  <a href="https://matrix.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">Matrix</a> is an open protocol for
decentralised communication.  Matrix allows users on different servers to
communicate with each other, similar to how people on different email servers
can email each other.</p>
<p>This book is an introduction to creating a client using the <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/client-server-api/#" rel="nofollow noopener">Matrix
Client-Server API</a>.  It will show how to make HTTP
calls to a Matrix homeserver, and discuss issues that clients will need to
consider, such as reliability and security issues.  It does not attempt to be a
comprehensive guide to the entire Client-Server API, but will point you to the
relevant portions of spec for further details.</p>
<p>You should read this book if:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>you are creating a Matrix library/SDK,</p></li>
<li><p>you are writing a Matrix client without the use of a library/SDK, or</p></li>
<li><p>you want to get a better understanding of how Matrix works.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you are creating a Matrix client using a library/SDK, some of the
information in this book may still be useful, but some things will already be
handled by your library/SDK.</p>
<p>We assume that you have:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>an understanding of JSON encoding,</p></li>
<li><p>an understanding of HTTP requests, including HTTP status codes, headers, and
different types of requests (<code>GET</code>, <code>POST</code>, etc.),</p></li>
<li><p>experience writing asynchronous code in your preferred programming language.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This book is written in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming" rel="nofollow noopener">literate
programming</a> style, which
interleaves code blocks and text.  In short, code blocks are named, and can
reference other code blocks using the syntax <code>{{other code block name}}</code>, which
will insert the code blocks with the given name in place of the reference.
Multiple code blocks can have the same name, in which case they are inserted in
the order that they appear in the book (though in many cases, the order does
not matter).  This allows us to, for example, have a reference such as <code>{{class Foo methods}}</code>, and define the methods of the <code>Foo</code> class in multiple chunks.</p>
<p>The code output of this book will be a library that a Matrix client could use.
The actual user interface for a client is out of scope for this book, although
for some topics, there may be discussion on how clients may wish to display
things to the user.</p>
<p>The code is written in Python using <a href="https://docs.aiohttp.org/" rel="nofollow noopener"><code>aiohttp</code></a>, but
the rest of the content should apply any other programming languages and most
of the code should be easy to port to another language.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>The main purpose of the example code here is to illustrate how the Matrix
Client-Server API is used, rather than to develop a fully-featured library.
While the library generated should be usable for simple situations, it may make
some tradeoffs differently from what a “real” Matrix library would make.  These
tradeoffs will be discussed in the text where appropriate.</p>
</div>
<p>The source for this book, including the example code, is available at
<a href="https://gitlab.com/uhoreg/matrix-tutorial" rel="nofollow noopener">https://gitlab.com/uhoreg/matrix-tutorial</a>.  We will call our Matrix library
the very unimaginative name <code>matrixlib</code>.</p>
<div data-controller="code"><pre><code><span># {{copyright}}</span>

<span>"""Matrix client library example"""</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The main entry point for our library will be a <code>client</code> module.  It will
contain helper functions and a <a href="https://uhoreg.gitlab.io/matrix-tutorial/client.html"><span><code>Client</code> class</span></a>, representing a
client connection.</p>

<p>In the first chapter of this book, we will discover the basics of the Matrix
Client-Server API.  We will learn how to make requests to the homeserver, log
in and out, and send and receive messages.  Using this, we will create a simple
echo bot.</p>
