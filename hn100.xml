We learn how your team works, identify “winning” strategies behaviors, then share them with the whole team during and after calls!</p><p>We’re working on fun engineering challenges including complex distributed systems, low-latency algorithms &amp; infrastructure, and modeling sales calls with large language models. You'll also have the chance to make a huge impact on our customers (sales reps who spend 80% of their work day on Nooks.)</p><p>Right now we’re a small team (~25 ppl) growing super quickly - doubling revenue every quarter, and recently hit $2M ARR!</p><p>Looking for experienced engineers who love tackling difficult product questions and working closely with customers.

With an ageing population and an average 10-year gap between lifespan and years in good health, the demand for care is rampant. With care homes becoming even less appealing post-covid, and a projected shortage of 400,000 professional carers by 2028, family caregivers are filling the void. 12,000 people are thrust into a caregiving role each day in the UK alone [0].</p><p>We are building a caregiving super app that will provide the right tools, support and community to make caregiving responsibilities significantly more manageable and prevent caregiver burnout.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



<p>29th November 2023</p>

<p>Mozilla’s innovation group and Justine Tunney <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2023/11/introducing-llamafile/">just released llamafile</a>, and I think it’s now the single best way to get started running Large Language Models (think your own local copy of ChatGPT) on your own computer.</p>
<p>A llamafile is a single multi-GB file that contains both the model weights for an LLM and the code needed to run that model—in some cases a full local server with a web UI for interacting with it.</p>
<p>The executable is compiled using <a href="https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/index.html">Cosmopolitan Libc</a>, Justine’s incredible project that supports compiling a single binary that works, unmodified, on multiple different operating systems and hardware architectures.</p>
<p>Here’s how to get started with <a href="https://llava-vl.github.io/">LLaVA 1.5</a>, a large multimodal model (which means text and image inputs, like GPT-4 Vision) fine-tuned on top of Llama 2. I’ve tested this process on an M2 Mac, but it should work on other platforms as well (though be sure to <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-Ocho/llamafile#gotchas">read the Gotchas</a> section of the README, and take a look at Justine’s <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38465916">list of supported platforms</a> in a comment on Hacker News).</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Download the 4.26GB <code>llamafile-server-0.1-llava-v1.5-7b-q4</code> file <a href="https://huggingface.co/jartine/llava-v1.5-7B-GGUF/blob/main/llava-v1.5-7b-q4-server.llamafile">from Justine’s repository on Hugging Face</a>.</p>
<p><code>curl -LO https://huggingface.co/jartine/llava-v1.5-7B-GGUF/resolve/main/llava-v1.5-7b-q4-server.llamafile</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make that binary executable, by running this in a terminal:</p>
<p><code>chmod 755 llava-v1.5-7b-q4-server.llamafile</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run your new executable, which will start a web server on port 8080:</p>
<p><code>./llava-v1.5-7b-q4-server.llamafile</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Navigate to <code>http://127.0.0.1:8080/</code> to start interacting with the model in your browser.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s all there is to it. On my M2 Mac it runs at around 55 tokens a second, which is <em>really</em> fast. And it can analyze images—here’s what I got when I uploaded a photograph and asked “Describe this plant”:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2023/llamafile.jpg" alt="Screenshot. llama.cpp - then a photo I took of a plant  User: Describe this plant  Llama: The image features a large, green plant with numerous thin branches and leaves. Among the many stems of this plant, there is an orange flower visible near its center. This beautifully decorated plant stands out in the scene due to its vibrant colors and intricate structure.  18ms per token, 54.24 tokens per second Powered by llama.cpp, ggml.ai, and llamafile"></p>
<h4 id="llamafile-how-this-works">How this works</h4>
<p>There are a number of different components working together here to make this work.</p>
<ul>
<li>The LLaVA 1.5 model by Haotian Liu, Chunyuan Li, Yuheng Li and Yong Jae Lee is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03744">described in this paper</a>, with further details on <a href="https://llava-vl.github.io/">llava-vl.github.io</a>.</li>
<li>The models are executed using <a href="https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp">llama.cpp</a>, and in the above demo also use the <code>llama.cpp</code> server example to provide the UI.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/index.html">Cosmopolitan Libc</a> is the magic that makes one binary work on multiple platforms. I wrote more about that in a TIL a few months ago, <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/cosmopolitan/ecosystem">Catching up with the Cosmopolitan ecosystem</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="llamafile-trying-other-models">Trying more models</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-Ocho/llamafile">llamafile README</a> currently links to binaries for <code>Mistral-7B-Instruct</code>, <code>LLaVA 1.5</code> and <code>WizardCoder-Python-13B</code>.</p>
<p>You can also download a much smaller <code>llamafile</code> binary from <a href="https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile/releases/tag/0.1">their releases</a>, which can then execute any model that has been compiled to GGUF format:</p>
<p>I grabbed <code>llamafile-server-0.1</code> (4.45MB) like this:</p>
<div><pre>curl -LO https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile/releases/download/0.1/llamafile-server-0.1
chmod 755 llamafile-server-0.1</pre></div>
<p>Then ran it against a 13GB <code>llama-2-13b.Q8_0.gguf</code> file I had <a href="https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-13B-GGUF/tree/main">previously downloaded</a>:</p>
<div><pre>./llamafile-server-0.1 -m llama-2-13b.Q8_0.gguf</pre></div>
<p>This gave me the same interface at <code>http://127.0.0.1:8080/</code> (without the image upload) and let me talk with the model at 24 tokens per second.</p>
<h4 id="llamafile-one-file">One file is all you need</h4>
<p>I think my favourite thing about llamafile is what it represents. This is a single binary file which you can download and then use, forever, on (almost) any computer.</p>

<p>You don’t need a network connection, and you don’t need to keep track of more than one file.</p>

<p>Stick that file on a USB stick and stash it in a drawer as insurance against a future apocalypse. You’ll never be without a language model ever again.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="article-body" data-attribute="article-content-body"><p>New members of the global super-rich gained more of their assets through inheritance than through wealth creation this year — the first time that this has been recorded by Swiss bank UBS in its nine years of surveying global billionaires.</p><p>A total of $141bn was amassed by 84 self-made billionaires around the world in 2023, while $151bn was passed on to 53 heirs, the bank’s research found.</p><p>“The heirs to billionaires are gaining prominence,” said Benjamin Cavalli, UBS’s head of global wealth management strategic clients. “New billionaires minted during this year’s study period accumulated more wealth through inheritance than entrepreneurship. That’s a theme we expect to see more of over the next 20 to 30 years, as more than 1,000 billionaires pass an estimated $5.2tn to their children.”</p><p><span>$151bn</span><span>Amount inherited in 2023 by billionaires taking part in UBS survey</span></p><p>The study found that the number of billionaires worldwide rose from 2,376 to 2,544 in the 12 months to April 2023, with Europeans whose fortunes are linked to consumer-focused companies experiencing the strongest growth in assets. “The great wealth transfer is really gaining momentum now”, said Max Kunkel, chief investment officer for global family and institutional wealth at UBS. </p><p>But he added that the survey results also indicated a relative slowdown in wealth creation.&nbsp;“It suggests that it is more difficult to create wealth in an environment of high interest rates and economic/geopolitical uncertainty,” Kunkel added.</p><p>The findings come as the ‘<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/63027e28-724a-40bc-a929-7dec5125926c" data-trackable="link">great wealth transfer</a>’ — from elderly baby boomers and Generation X to millennials and younger — continues. Research firm Cerulli Associates estimates that some $73tn will be inherited by 2045 in the US alone.</p><figure><picture><source media="(min-width: 700px)" srcset="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A35b23d6a-6079-4884-aab3-9b39528b7167?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=1 1x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A35b23d6a-6079-4884-aab3-9b39528b7167?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=2 2x" width="1458" height="1042"><source media="(max-width: 490px)" srcset="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A22a9af4f-2807-4503-aaff-cdc1ea8ebdd1?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=490&amp;dpr=1 1x" width="625" height="1563"><img src="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd6c748xw2pzm8.cloudfront.net%2Fprod%2F103eaba0-41b6-11ee-b7a9-3b283a07f9ae-standard.png?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=1" alt="Global wealth creation.

However, Kunkel noted that first and second-generation billionaires had different fears about the outlook, with first-generation wealthy more focused on the potential for a US recession and other immediate threats.</p><p>Another generational split emerged in billionaires’ preferred asset classes. Older investors were more likely to plan to expand their range of investments into fixed income and private credit, while younger investors remained keener on public and private equity.</p><p>“Among our older billionaire investors, there is a focus on income generating assets, fixed income and also private credit,” Kunkel said. “Anecdotally, it’s on the very high quality part of private credit. The next generation is thinking more about long term risk; geopolitical and innovation.” </p><p>Commenting on the survey, Matthew Fleming, partner at London-based wealth manager Stonehage Fleming, said: “It’s possible that this period of great wealth creation is over.” </p><p>He added that Stonehage Fleming’s own client research chimed with some of UBS’s results. Geopolitics was at the forefront of ultra-high-net-worth individuals’ investment decisions, while younger elites were more likely to consider the societal impact of their assets than their parents.</p><p>“It’s a good thing that responsible custodians are taking on great wealth at this time”, he said. “The key is to make sure that the next generation is properly prepared to handle the responsibility.”</p></article></div>]]></description>

It might start off benign – storing a previous page of data for that instant back button experience, implementing a bit of undo logic, or merging some state from different API requests. But we all know what ends up happening. More feature requests show up, and soon we’re busy implementing data caches, manual indexes, optimistic mutations, and recursive cache invalidation.</p>
<p>These features bear a remarkable resemblance to the inner workings of databases. Indeed, <strong>in any frontend application of sufficient complexity, engineers will necessarily end up building so many data management features that they are essentially creating a domain specific database</strong>. This added complexity is duplicated in each project we work on, and takes away from spending time on delighting users and solving business problems.</p>
<p>So today, I’d like you to join me as we take a look at common application data patterns, and how they relate to database features. Afterwards, we will take a look at an alternative solution to these patterns - a frontend optimized database stack which allows us to focus on the application rather than micromanaging data.</p>
<p>Welcome to the world of accidental database programming.</p>
<h2 id="the-humble-cache">The humble cache</h2>
<p>Our journey starts in the most humble of ways. Send an API request to the server and store it in a local variable. We might want to do this for any number of reasons, but one good example is working around declarative re-renders. Many modern web applications use declarative frameworks like React, which internally will re-render the tree many times over the course of a user’s interaction with a page. We wouldn’t want to issue an API request for each render - so we throw the data into a variable. Here is an example using <a href="https://react.dev/learn" data-astro-prefetch="">React Hooks</a>:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>const</span><span> Newsfeed</span><span> =</span><span> () </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>  const</span><span> [{ </span><span>loading</span><span>, </span><span>entries</span><span>, </span><span>error</span><span> }, </span><span>setEntries</span><span>] </span><span>=</span><span> useState</span><span>({</span></span>
<span><span>    loading: </span><span>true</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>    entries: [],</span></span>
<span><span>    error: </span><span>null</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>  });</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>  useEffect</span><span>(() </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>    NewsfeedAPI.</span><span>getAll</span><span>()</span></span>
<span><span>      .</span><span>then</span><span>((</span><span>entries</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> setEntries</span><span>({entries }))</span></span>
<span><span>      .</span><span>catch</span><span>((</span><span>error</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> setEntries</span><span>({ error }));</span></span>
<span><span>  }, []);</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>  // render loading, entries, and error states</span></span>
<span><span>  return</span><span> &lt;</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;...&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;;</span></span>
<span><span>};</span></span></code></pre>
<p>In this example<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-dont-do-this" data-astro-prefetch="" id="user-content-fnref-dont-do-this" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> we can see a basic API request cache stored using React state hooks. Once the API request completes, we will cache the result (or an error) until the component is removed and re-added to the tree.</p>
<p>Soon we are tempted to add more features. A common next step is to “lift the cache” into a higher layer, or out of the UI tree entirely.</p>
<p>One example of this is using <a href="https://redux.js.org/" data-astro-prefetch="">Redux</a>, a popular state management library for React. At its core, Redux allows developers to consolidate state and coordinate atomic changes to that state over time. However, over time, Redux has evolved into an ecosystem of tools and patterns which can be used to manage API data caching. The goal of using Redux (or similar) in this way is to centralize cache logic, coordinate refresh, and most importantly share cache results between components.</p>
<p>As our humble caching layer grows in complexity it starts to take on a new identity: A centralized storage system that coordinates with the rendering engine and user actions to efficiently wrangle data. We might say it’s starting to look a bit like a database…</p>
<p>But that’s crazy. Let’s talk about indexes instead.</p>
<h2 id="going-faster-with-indexes">Going faster with indexes</h2>
<p>When I started building web apps almost two decades ago, I was immediately drawn to the elegance of properly structured data. By organizing data in a certain way, the application could do less work and deliver a much better user experience. At the time, my interactions with data in the backend were abstracted through databases - databases which allowed me to think about indexes as magical fairy dust sprinkled on queries to make them go fast. It wasn’t until I joined <a href="https://www.singlestore.com/" data-astro-prefetch="">SingleStore</a> (formerly MemSQL) that I discovered how similar frontend data optimization was to the internals of database storage.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-simple-indexes" data-astro-prefetch="" id="user-content-fnref-simple-indexes" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup></p>
<p>One optimization we can leverage in the frontend is to store data cached from the server in an object keyed by ID. This often arises due to the structure of the underlying API. For example, in an application using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST" data-astro-prefetch="">REST API</a>, we often read some data in batch and then enrich specific objects as needed. This requires constantly merging API results into the cache which is made easier if objects are stored by ID. Let’s look at an example of this kind of cache:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>const</span><span> CACHE</span><span> =</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>  "f3ac87"</span><span>: {</span></span>
<span><span>    id: </span><span>"f3ac87"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>    author: </span><span>"@carlsverre"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>    title: </span><span>"stop building databases"</span><span>,</span></span>

<span><span>    createdAt: </span><span>new</span><span> Date</span><span>(),</span></span>
<span><span>  },</span></span>
<span><span>  /*</span></span>
<span><span>  "a281f0": { ... },</span></span>
<span><span>  "2f9f6c": { ... },</span></span>
<span><span>  ...</span></span>
<span><span>  */</span></span>
<span><span>};</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>// retrieval by ID</span></span>
<span><span>console.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>CACHE</span><span>[</span><span>"f3ac87"</span><span>]);</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>// update by ID</span></span>
<span><span>CACHE</span><span>[</span><span>"f3ac87"</span><span>].title </span><span>=</span><span> "everyone is a database programmer"</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre>
<p>In the example above, we are indexing entries by ID in a simple JavaScript object. Due to this “data shape,” we have optimized for creating, reading, updating, and deleting entries by ID. However, any operation that needs to look at multiple entries, such as a filter, would require checking every entry. Let’s improve this data structure to help us quickly look up entries by date:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>const</span><span> truncateTime</span><span> =</span><span> (</span><span>date</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>  const</span><span> clone</span><span> =</span><span> new</span><span> Date</span><span>(date);</span></span>
<span><span>  clone.</span><span>setHours</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>, </span><span>0</span><span>, </span><span>0</span><span>, </span><span>0</span><span>);</span></span>
<span><span>  return</span><span> clone;</span></span>
<span><span>};</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>const</span><span> ENTRIES_BY_DATE</span><span> =</span><span> Object.</span><span>groupBy</span><span>(</span></span>
<span><span>  Object.</span><span>values</span><span>(</span><span>CACHE</span><span>),</span></span>
<span><span>  (</span><span>e</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> truncateTime</span><span>(e.createdAt),</span></span>
<span><span>);</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>// filter by date == today</span></span>
<span><span>console.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>ENTRIES_BY_DATE</span><span>[</span><span>truncateTime</span><span>(</span><span>new</span><span> Date</span><span>())]);</span></span></code></pre>
<p>In this second example, we create a basic index tracking the year/month/day portion of each entry’s <code>createdAt</code> field.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-index-ways" data-astro-prefetch="" id="user-content-fnref-index-ways" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup> Now our frontend has gained the ability to quickly look up entries published on a given date – at the expense of having to maintain consistency between the two data structures: <code>CACHE</code> and <code>ENTRIES_BY_DATE</code>.</p>
<p>Consider what happens as we start managing many of these indexes - each requiring custom logic to build, update, and query. Verifying correctness quickly becomes a burden on testing and code review. Forgetting to properly delete or update an entry in one index can lead to difficult bugs. Soon, we are spending more time building infrastructure to manage this complexity than building new application features. <strong>It’s only a matter of time before we start to realize that we are, in fact, building a database.</strong></p>
<p>Caching and indexing data is not where our journey ends! Without fail, someone will realize that optimistically mutating these data structures could lead to a much snappier user experience.</p>
<h2 id="glass-half-full-mutations">Glass half-full mutations</h2>
<p>What are optimistic mutations anyway? Basically, the idea is to simulate the effect of a particular operation locally – before the server has had a chance to respond. By doing this, we can build user interfaces that seem to respond instantly, “eliminating” network latency. Of course, this comes at a cost - in the event that the server decides to do something other than anticipated (or there is some kind of error), the UI may need to “rollback” this change and prompt the user to fix issues. Assuming that the UI is good at predicting the server outcome (i.e. errors can be handled on the client side and logic is kept tightly in sync), optimistic mutations can be a powerful tool in a frontend engineer’s toolbox. It is also a great way to further practice our database engineering skills!</p>
<p>Let’s break down how optimistic mutations work, and think about the new challenges they bring to the table:</p>
<p><img src="https://sqlsync.dev/_astro/optimistic-updates.e800c3cb_MTwvt.webp" alt="A diagram illustrating the phases of an optimistic mutation's execution, which is described in detail below." width="1683" height="962" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<p>In the diagram above, we can trace the execution path of an optimistic update:</p>
<ol>
<li>The UI emits a write operation. In this case, the UI is trying to update some piece of data.</li>
<li>This update is optimistically applied to the local cache - making the assumption that the server will end up agreeing with this decision. The UI can immediately re-render with the new state.</li>
<li>Asynchronously, the update operation is sent to the server.</li>
<li>Finally, the server responds with the result of the update which is merged into the local cache, overwriting the earlier optimistic update. This allows the UI to re-render (if needed), leaving the system in a (hopefully) consistent state.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ensuring that this process maintains consistency with the server comes with a number of challenges. First, we need to duplicate logic between the client and server, so we can optimistically predict the result. Next, each in-flight mutation must be tracked in order to handle asynchronous errors or server disagreements. Finally, in order to provide the best user experience, the optimistic portion of the cache may even need to be made durable to reconcile changes across application restart. Solving each of these challenges incurs a huge tax on both developer time and correctness verification. <strong>Once again, we find ourselves micromanaging data rather than delighting customers with new, differentiating features.</strong></p>
<p>But these issues pale in comparison to what I like to call: recursive cache invalidation.</p>
<h2 id="recursive-cache-invalidation">Recursive Cache invalidation</h2>
<p>In any reasonably data intensive application, pieces of data will often show up in multiple places in the cache:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>const</span><span> CACHE</span><span> =</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>  projects: {</span></span>
<span><span>    1</span><span>: { id: </span><span>1</span><span>, name: </span><span>"build a spaceship"</span><span>, progress: </span><span>0.5</span><span>, numTasks: </span><span>10</span><span> },</span></span>
<span><span>    2</span><span>: { id: </span><span>2</span><span>, name: </span><span>"to the moon"</span><span>, progress: </span><span>0.0</span><span>, numTasks: </span><span>10</span><span> },</span></span>
<span><span>    // ...</span></span>
<span><span>  },</span></span>
<span><span>  tasks: {</span></span>
<span><span>    1</span><span>: { id: </span><span>1</span><span>, project: </span><span>1</span><span>, name: </span><span>"finish hull design"</span><span>, status: </span><span>"pending"</span><span> },</span></span>
<span><span>    9</span><span>: { id: </span><span>9</span><span>, project: </span><span>1</span><span>, name: </span><span>"order bolts"</span><span>, status: </span><span>"pending"</span><span> },</span></span>
<span><span>    // ...</span></span>
<span><span>  },</span></span>
<span><span>  users: {</span></span>
<span><span>    1</span><span>: { id: </span><span>1</span><span>, name: </span><span>"Carl"</span><span>, assignedTasks: [</span><span>1</span><span>] },</span></span>
<span><span>    2</span><span>: { id: </span><span>2</span><span>, name: </span><span>"ChatGPT"</span><span>, assignedTasks: [</span><span>9</span><span>] },</span></span>
<span><span>  },</span></span>
<span><span>};</span></span></code></pre>
<p>In the example above, we are caching projects, tasks, and users working on an important space mission.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-space" data-astro-prefetch="" id="user-content-fnref-space" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">4</a></sup> Let’s figure out what we need to do after we complete a task in order to keep the cache consistent with the server:</p>
<p><img src="https://sqlsync.dev/_astro/recursive-invalidation.65e234ff_1PWkQ2.webp" alt="A sequence diagram illustrating recursive invalidation as outlined below." width="331" height="335" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<p>Let’s walk through the steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>We inform the server that the task is complete.</li>
<li>Refresh the project as its progress has now changed.</li>
<li>60% complete! Now let’s check for new task assignments.</li>
<li>Darn, more work to do. Let’s see what the new assignment is.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this example, the UI has to do multiple round trips after an update to correctly invalidate every part of the cache that was potentially changed. While it’s certainly possible to build more complex APIs that reduce this into one trip,<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-graphql" data-astro-prefetch="" id="user-content-fnref-graphql" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">5</a></sup> ultimately the result is coupling API or client logic to the underlying data model. Let’s consider two reasons why this might be bad:</p>
<p>First, this requires that the UI knows what part of the cache is relevant to each mutation. This can become very brittle at scale, as data relationships and aggregations may influence many parts of the local cache. Also, as the engineering team grows, these issues may even cross team boundaries, which can start to feel similar to mutable global variables in large software projects.</p>
<p>Second, when coupled with optimistic mutations, reproducing server logic on the client side in order to predict server changes becomes much more difficult. For example, in this case, we may want to optimistically remove task 1 from user 1 and increase the progress value by calculating a new ratio (we can use the total number of tasks). As we teach our applications how to predict these nested changes locally, our clients naturally duplicate more and more of the backend stack.</p>
<h2 id="are-we-building-databases">Are we building databases?</h2>
<p>In any frontend application of sufficient complexity, engineers will necessarily end up building so many data management features that they are essentially creating a domain specific database. This added complexity is duplicated in each project we work on and takes away from spending time on delighting users and solving business problems. My goal here was to shine a light on these patterns we have grown accustomed to and ask: <strong>where is the frontend optimized database stack we deserve?</strong></p>
<p>I’m tired of waiting - so I’m tackling this problem head-on. I call it <a href="https://github.com/orbitinghail/sqlsync" data-astro-prefetch="">SQLSync</a>. SQLSync is a frontend optimized database stack built on top of <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/" data-astro-prefetch="">SQLite</a><sup><a href="#user-content-fn-sqlite-stats" data-astro-prefetch="" id="user-content-fnref-sqlite-stats" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">6</a></sup> with a synchronization engine powered by ideas from <a href="https://git-scm.com/" data-astro-prefetch="">Git</a> and distributed systems. The stack is designed to integrate seamlessly with the most popular frontend frameworks like <a href="https://react.dev/" data-astro-prefetch="">React</a>, <a href="https://vuejs.org/" data-astro-prefetch="">Vue</a>, and <a href="https://nextjs.org/" data-astro-prefetch="">Next.js</a>. SQLSync’s goal is to handle the hardest data management problems, allowing developers to focus on what makes their application unique.</p>
<p>As an early example of what SQLSync can do, check out <a href="https://sqlsync-todo.pages.dev/" data-astro-prefetch="">this Todo app</a>. The entire data layer is implemented in <a href="https://github.com/orbitinghail/sqlsync/blob/ba762ce2a10afbb8d7856d26ce5b2f108716e38d/demo/demo-reducer/src/lib.rs" data-astro-prefetch="">60 lines of Rust</a> and a couple of <a href="https://github.com/orbitinghail/sqlsync/blob/ba762ce2a10afbb8d7856d26ce5b2f108716e38d/demo/frontend/src/components/TaskList.tsx#L12" data-astro-prefetch="">SQL queries</a> scattered across components. In exchange, SQLSync provides a durable cache, the full power of SQLite (indexes, constraints, triggers, query optimization), optimistic mutations, smart cache invalidation, and reactive queries.</p>
<p>Let’s briefly take a deeper look at how SQLSync approaches each of the data management problems we’ve discussed today.</p>
<p>SQLSync stores data locally in one or more SQLite databases. At face value, this gives us a durable cache that looks very similar to the databases we use in the backend. But it’s a durable cache with superpowers!</p>
<p>First off, indexes can be created easily, and are automatically kept in sync with the data. Just like on the backend, these indexes can be automatically used by the database to accelerate queries.</p>
<p>But it’s not just indexes! SQLite also gives us the full power of SQL which can easily express complex queries over our data, as well as <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/lang_createtrigger.html" data-astro-prefetch="">triggers</a>, <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/foreignkeys.html" data-astro-prefetch="">foreign keys</a>, <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/lang_createtable.html#check_constraints" data-astro-prefetch="">constraints</a>, and extensions such as <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/fts5.html" data-astro-prefetch="">full-text search</a>.</p>
<p>On top of all that, SQLSync provides optimistic mutations out of the box. It does this by handling mutations in a reducer, similar to <a href="https://redux.js.org/introduction/core-concepts" data-astro-prefetch="">how Redux works</a>. The reducer can be written in any language that can be compiled to WebAssembly. Using this reducer, SQLSync can execute mutations optimistically on the client, and then run them in a globally consistent order on the server. Finally, the client performs an operation similar to a <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing" data-astro-prefetch="">Git Rebase</a> to synchronize the client with the server.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-sqlsync-talk" data-astro-prefetch="" id="user-content-fnref-sqlsync-talk" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">7</a></sup></p>
<p>One advantage of SQLSync’s architecture is that it eliminates the need for recursive cache invalidation. By writing all the data mutation logic within a reducer that can be easily shared on both the client and the server, all changes made during a mutation are automatically visible. Even better, due to synchronization working like “Git Rebase”, this approach allows the server to make different changes than what happened on the client - with the guarantee that the client will always reach the same consistent outcome. This is a powerful capability that eliminates the need for developers to spend mental bandwidth on data micromanagement.</p>
<h2 id="lets-talk">Let’s talk!</h2>
<p>I’m building SQLSync because I want to make client-side applications easier to build without us having to reinvent the wheel each time. If you share my vision of the future, consider <a href="https://github.com/orbitinghail/sqlsync" data-astro-prefetch="">starring SQLSync on Github</a>, <a href="https://discord.gg/etFk2N9nzC" data-astro-prefetch="">joining our discord</a>, or <a href="https://sqlsync.dev/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#1078757c7c7f507f62727964797e777871797c3e747566" data-astro-prefetch="">emailing me</a>. I’d love to hear what your perfect client-side database looks like and what you think about SQLSync’s approach to the problem.</p>
<h2 id="prior-art">Prior art</h2>
<p>The topic of using a database (or database methods) in the frontend stack is a popular topic these days. I’d like to highlight some specific articles that I found insightful and relevant.</p>
<h3 id="riffle">Riffle</h3>
<p>In Riffle’s essay <a href="https://riffle.systems/essays/prelude/" data-astro-prefetch="">“Building data-centric apps with a reactive relational database”</a>, the authors explore the idea of storing all application state – including UI state – in a single reactive database. Some key ideas that inspired this blog post as well as the development of SQLSync include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reactive queries provide a clean mental model and align well with declarative systems like React</li>
<li>Solving technical challenges in client-side application development using ideas originating in the database community</li>
<li>The benefits of modeling state using a relational data model and real indexes</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="instantdb">Instant.db</h3>
<p>Stepan, the author of Instant.db, wrote two fantastic blog posts on databases in the browser.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://stopa.io/post/279" data-astro-prefetch="">Database in the Browser, a Spec</a></li>
<li><a href="https://stopa.io/post/296" data-astro-prefetch="">A Graph-Based Firebase</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I highly recommend reading both posts, as they describe many of the same issues I mention in this post, with more of a focus on the relationship between the frontend and backend stack. Ultimately Stepan clearly describes the motivation which led to the creation of Instant.db, a graph-based successor to Firebase.</p>
<h3 id="cr-sqlite">CR-SQLite</h3>
<p>Matt Wonlaw’s <a href="https://github.com/vlcn-io/cr-sqlite" data-astro-prefetch="">CR-SQLite</a> is an extension to SQLite which uses conflict free replicated data types (CRDTs) and causally ordered event logs to support merging data consistently. This allows peer-to-peer applications to store and collaborate on data in SQLite without requiring a central coordinator. This project is also a fantastic example of running SQLite in the browser.</p>
<p>In addition, Matt is exploring related ideas like <a href="https://github.com/vlcn-io/materialite" data-astro-prefetch="">incremental computation</a> and making SQL easier to work with via <a href="https://github.com/vlcn-io/typed-sql" data-astro-prefetch="">typed-sql</a>. Overall, Matt is an inspiring builder in the space, and I recommend taking a look at what he is working on.</p>

That share fell by about half through 2022 as companies called employees back to in-person work.</p><p>However, the story has changed in 2023.</p><p>The share of paid work-from-home days has been "totally flat" this year, hovering around 28%, said Bloom in an interview with CNBC. That's still four times greater than the 7% pre-pandemic level. The U.S. Census Bureau's Household Pulse Survey shows a similar trend, he said.</p></div><div><p>Meanwhile, Kastle data that measures the frequency of employee office swipe-ins shows that office occupancy in the 10 largest U.S. metro areas has flatlined at around 50% in 2023, Bloom said.</p><p>"We are three and a half years in, and we're totally stuck," Bloom said of remote work. "It would take something as extreme as the pandemic to unstick it."</p></div><h2><a id="headline0"></a>Why remote work has had staying power</h2><div><p>The initial surge of remote work was spurred by Covid-19 lockdowns and stay-at-home orders.</p><p>But many workers came to like the arrangement. Among the primary benefits: no commute, flexible work schedules and less time getting ready for work, according to WFH Research.</p><p>The trend has been reinforced by a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/03/the-job-market-is-strong-economists-say-but-workers-dont-think-so-.html">hot job market</a> in the U.S. since early 2021, giving workers unprecedented leverage. If a worker didn't like their company benefits, odds were good they could quit and get a job with better work arrangements and pay elsewhere.</p><p>Research has shown that the typical worker equates the value of working from home to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/31/a-pay-freeze-vs-returning-to-office-workers-equally-hate-both-options.html">an 8% pay raise</a>.</p><p><strong>More from Personal Finance:</strong><br><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/28/us-passport-delays-have-eased-but-arent-yet-back-to-normal.html">U.S. passport delays have eased</a><br><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/30/dont-make-these-common-401k-plan-mistakes.html">Don't make these common 401(k) mistakes</a><br><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/30/inflation-reduction-act-tax-breaks-help-boost-home-energy-efficiency.html">How a tax break can help heat your home more efficiently</a></p><p>However, the work-from-home trend isn't just a perk for workers. It has been a profitable arrangement for many companies, economists said.</p><p>Among the potential benefits: reduced costs for real estate, wages and recruitment, better worker retention and an expanded pool from which to recruit talent. Meanwhile, worker productivity hasn't suffered, Bloom said.</p><p>"What makes companies money tends to stick," he said.</p></div><h2><a id="headline1"></a>Remote policies show 'incredible diversity'</h2><div><p>These days, most remote work is done as part of a "hybrid" arrangement, with some days at home and the rest in the office. About 47% of employees who can work from home were hybrid as of October 2023, while 19% are full-time remote and 34% are fully on site, according to WFH Research.</p><p>About 11% of online job postings today advertise positions as fully remote or hybrid, versus 3% before the pandemic, said Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter.</p><p>While remote work is the labor market's new normal, there's significant variety from company to company, Pollak said.</p></div><div id="Placeholder-ArticleBody-Video-107285373" data-test="VideoPlaceHolder" role="region" tabindex="0" data-vilynx-id="7000311695" aria-labelledby="Placeholder-ArticleBody-Video-107285373"><p><img src="https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107285374-16917755381691775534-30719088191-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1691779089&amp;w=750&amp;h=422&amp;vtcrop=y" alt="Remote work expands job opportunity for both workers and employers, says Stanford's Steven Davis"><span></span><span></span></p></div><div><p>For example, 7% of workers are required to be in the office one day a week, while 9% are required in two days, 13% three days and 8% four days, according to a recent ZipRecruiter employer <a href="https://www.ziprecruiter-research.org/annual-employer-survey/remote-or-rto-employers-and-workers-meet-in-the-middle" target="_blank">survey</a>. Nearly 1 in 5,<strong> </strong>18%, have discretion over their in-person workdays.</p><p>"The new normal is this incredible diversity," Pollak said.</p><p>"There's still a lot of experimentation going on," she said. "But the aggregate effect is that remote work is steady."</p></div><h2><a id="headline2"></a>Why remote work will likely increase beyond 2025</h2><div><p>While it's unlikely that the prevalence of remote work will ever decline to its pre-pandemic level, it's possible that a U.S. recession — and a weaker job market — may cause it to slide a bit, economists said.</p><p>"Employers say the biggest benefit of remote work is retention," Pollak said. In a labor market with more slack, "retention gets much easier."</p><p>However, since work-from-home arrangements also save companies money, it's likely a severe recession would be necessary to see a meaningful decline, Bloom said.</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<p>I was running some benchmarks the other day. I usually have a lot of things running (Teams, Chrome, IDE, etc…) but I have to close everything to run some tight benchmarks.</p>



<p>When I am done, one of the first things I open again is Chrome and that’s when I realized, why does CPU usage goes up and the fan starts spinning as soon as I open Chrome? It should stay at zero. Chrome is extremely resources hungry when there are many heavy pages opened but I don’t have many tabs opened.</p>



<p>The only tab I have opened and set as my home page is BitBucket. Coincidence?????</p>



<p>Long story short, there is a buggy animation in the BitBucket web UI that’s wasting half a CPU core at all times when there is a build in progress. The issue is with the “build in progress” icon animation.</p>





<p>The icon is a static SVG image that’s about 3 lines of text. </p>



<p>The icon is rotated by a CSS animation.</p>



<pre><code>.build-status-icon.build-in-progress-icon {
    animation-name: rotate-animation;
    animation-play-state: running;
    animation-iteration-count: infinite;
    animation-duration: 1.5s;
    animation-delay: 0s;
    animation-timing-function: linear;
    transform-origin: center;
}</code></pre>



<p>The CSS animation has terrible performance characteristics.</p>



<p>You can open Chrome monitoring tools with Shift+Escape.</p>



<ul>
<li>When the animation is running, whenever a build is in progress, chrome shows the tab is using 30% to 70% of a CPU and the GPU is spinning near 90%.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>When removing the animation (tip: remove the css or set status to “paused”), the CPU sits near 0% and the GPU near 0%. </li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>The CPU spikes occasionally, the page is polling the server periodically to update PR and build status. That part is normal.</li>
</ul>



<p>Numbers on a laptop, you could get a third of that if you have better hardware than me (tip: use a desktop). I’d love to say this is an old CPU running on a low frequency in power saving mode, but not quite, this is the most expensive laptop in the manufacturer line up with the most expensive CPU available, the laptop can’t scale down frequency because of BitBucket and Slack requesting and wasting too much power, the laptop can’t really scale up frequency because of overheating.</p>



<p>That is to conclude: bad software running on bad hardware.</p>











<h2>If you are curious for more</h2>



<p>That’s all for today unless you are curious for more details. Personally, I was definitely curious how a seemingly trivial animation can be so slow?</p>



<p>The Chrome performance tools have a timeline showing the time to render each frame. Target is 60 frame per second, or 16 ms per frame.</p>



<ul>
<li>The timeline shows 6 ms to render when the animation is running. </li>



<li>The timeline shows only 1 ms or 2 ms to render when the animation is removed. </li>
</ul>



<p>The computer is doing a lot more work and recomputing the layout of the entire page. One thing I do not understand though is why Chrome is showing full GPU usage? Where does GPU usage go to?</p>



<p>One thing that is remarkable, the icon is displaying a circle, but the icon image is really a square with transparent corners (inside a div container that is a rectangle).</p>



<p>A circle can be rotated in place. It doesn’t take more space than the initial circle. A square cannot.</p>



<p>Did I say the “build in progress” circle is not a circle? The circle is a square! It’s a square!</p>



<p>Rotating a square cannot be done in place. Let me give one quick picture to illustrate.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="16507" data-permalink="https://thehftguy.com/2023/11/21/buggy-animation-in-atlassian-bitbucket-is-wasting-half-a-cpu-core-at-all-times/image-5-2/" data-orig-file="https://thehftguy.files.wordpress.com/2023/11/image-5.png" data-orig-size="605,187" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-5" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://thehftguy.files.wordpress.com/2023/11/image-5.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://thehftguy.files.wordpress.com/2023/11/image-5.png?w=605" width="605" height="187" src="https://thehftguy.files.wordpress.com/2023/11/image-5.png?w=605" alt="" srcset="https://thehftguy.files.wordpress.com/2023/11/image-5.png 605w, https://thehftguy.files.wordpress.com/2023/11/image-5.png?w=150 150w, https://thehftguy.files.wordpress.com/2023/11/image-5.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 605px) 100vw, 605px"><figcaption>Illustration, this is an example table from W3C with the first example I could find on stack overflow to add a CSS rotate animation. The example image happens to be a cat picture.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Hopefully that’s good enough to explain that a square picture is getting out of bounds as it rotates. In this basic example, the table does not resize to fit the rotated image and the image overlaps on other content.</p>



<p>In a real world app that is responsive and highly dynamic, like BitBucket, the page is usually adjusted to fit content, neighboring elements get pushed out to fit the rotating image, then neighboring and parents elements get adjusted too… the layout of the entire page is redone on every frame because of the rotating image.</p>



<p>You can see for yourself if you have the software. You can highlight elements (like in the screenshot above) with the developer tools and you will be able to see invisible containers getting resized in real time. I think that’s what the CPU is busy doing most of the time. </p>

  <p>
   We love macOS, but we’re not a fan of the ever-closing hardware and ecosystem. So, we are creating ravynOS&nbsp;—&nbsp;an OS aimed to provide the finesse of macOS with the freedom of FreeBSD.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    ravynOS <b>(previously called airyxOS)</b> is an open-source operating system based on FreeBSD, CMU Mach, and Apple open-source code that aims to be compatible with macOS applications and has no hardware restrictions.

        <h4>ravynOS, Always</h4>
        <p>
          We're building familiar apps native to ravynOS, packaged as portable
          .app bundles and built with our core technologies of Cocoa, Qt, and
          Mach. These are guaranteed to work and fit seamlessly into your desktop.

        <h4>FreeBSD, Mostly</h4>
        <p>
          FreeBSD ports that support Wayland continue to work on ravynOS right out
          of the box, or with minor changes.
        </p>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div>
        <h4>Linux, Sometimes</h4>
        <p>
          Many Linux applications that support Wayland are expected to work with FreeBSD’s Linux emulation
          layer.
        </p>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div>
        <h4>macOS, Maybe</h4>
        <p>
          Trivial macOS and Darwin applications may run directly on ravynOS. This is an active
          area of work and research.  AppKit-based source code may build and run natively.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
      <p><span><strong>Today in Tedium:</strong> As an experienced survivor of the email wars, I have seen many things over the years that should not work, but ultimately pull off unexpected and weird tricks. Some of these are absolutely necessary because of code failures created by larger entities who failed to properly implement proper HTML code, or more egregiously, forced users to create code that was the opposite of elegant, just to get a reasonably desirable result. But some of these hacks were actually brilliant and worth remembering for their sheer inventiveness. After all, we weren’t going to let Internet Explorer get in the way of a good design, right? Today’s Tedium talks about HTML hacks—whether structural or technical—that carried us through at a time when there were no guarantees that our webpages were going to work. We’re listing them out. Here’s ten. <em>— Ernie @ Tedium</em></span></p>


<div>
    
<p><img data-src="https://images.tedium.co/uploads/Netscape-Communicator.png" width="800" height="572" alt="Netscape Communicator" src="https://images.tedium.co/uploads/Netscape-Communicator.png"></p>
<p><em>Remember when our browsers defaulted to gray backgrounds? That was weird, right?</em></p>
<h3>1. The Netscape Navigator 4.0 @import hack</h3>

<p>Perhaps the first true HTML hack as we know them today, this is perhaps its purest form. Such hacks are generally used to block off code that, based on valid HTML or CSS standards, should work, but because of implementation gaps on the browser end, allow the layout to be prevented from working correctly.</p>
<p>As the <a href="https://litux.nl/mirror/csscookbook/0596005768/cssckbk-CHP-9-SECT-1.html">CSS Cookbook</a> notes, this hack effectively works by loading two HTML files, one of which will not work in Netscape:</p>
<pre><code>  &lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="all" title="Basic CSS" href="/basic.css" /&gt;
  
  &lt;style type="text/css" media="all"&gt;
  
  @import "/css/advanced.css";
  
  &lt;/style&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>What’s interesting about this is the reason it doesn’t work. As the book explains, <a href="https://www.w3.org/submissions/1996/1/WD-jsss-960822">Netscape fought hard for a competing standard, JSSS</a>, to defeat CSS, but the World Wide Web Consortium went another direction, leading to a heavily rushed CSS implementation in Netscape 4, which came out in the summer of 1997. That meant it worked terribly, especially compared to later browsers, and that meant as CSS grew more mature, Netscape 4 became dead weight.</p>
<p>(One fun side effect: If you disable JavaScript in the browser, it also disables CSS—something that is not true of most web browsers.)</p>
</div>
<div>
    
<p><img data-src="https://images.tedium.co/uploads/Killer-Sites.jpg" width="799" height="1000" alt="Killer Sites" src="https://images.tedium.co/uploads/Killer-Sites.jpg"></p>
<p><em>This book convinced a generation of Web developers that they didn’t have to wait for CSS.</em></p>
<h3>2. Using HTML tables for layout</h3>

<p>So if we step back and talk about the web browser, it’s worth remembering how disruptive it was. Here was this amazing technology, and people wanted to do more with it than what was technically allowed on the tin.</p>
<p>One of those people was David Siegel, and he came to the Web as a traditional designer. Designers tend to break convention, and Siegel effectively took a semantic-data tool, the HTML table, and decided to use it to build layouts.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, everyone did it (and in the email world, everyone still does), but it is the definition of a hack—and Seigel was one of the first to find it.</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.org/details/creatingkiller1997sieg/page/4/mode/2up">In his book <em>Creating Killer Web Sites</em></a>, he explained how he decided to flout convention, which presumed that HTML’s visual appearance would be determined by the browser owner, to build better looking websites:</p>
<blockquote><p>I threw my HTML book in the trash and started from scratch. I figured out a bunch of tricks to get around structural markup and make pages the way I wanted them to look. I began using images to lay out pages in two dimensions, rather than one. When tables became available, I poured columns of test in them. I reduced the colors and made the file sizes small and—guess what?—people came! The numbers actually broke my access counter. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/tables-layout-absurd/">As Jay Hoffman of <em>The History of the Web</em> explains</a>, this was perceived as a huge no-no, because HTML and XML purists felt that design and code structure should not mix. (It also busted accessibility, a realistic concern that took years to repair.) But the idea of a portal that could be visually shaped by the developer was clearly valuable, and it’s probably up there with responsive design in terms of homegrown ideas that reshaped the internet forever.</p>

<p><em>A modern display of CSS, which didn’t have to rely on such terrible hacks. Side note: Could you imagine being so desperate to get your website working that you just put random characters in the editor to see what happens? (<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/text-NzERTNpnaDw">Ferenc Almasi/Unsplash</a>)</em></p>
<h3>3. Putting an underscore in front of a CSS style</h3>

<p>It sounds silly, but this was an important feature for developers during the Internet Explorer era. The reason for this is that IE often did things counter to every other web browser. A famous example of this is the box model. While the W3C intended for the width of a box to exclude the border and padding, Internet Explorer did not account for paddings and borders, leading to significant differences between browsers.</p>
<p>At the time IE6 first came out, Microsoft dominated the browser market, so it wasn’t an immediate problem. As the browser got older, however, it necessitated numerous weird hacks, of which the underscore hack was one. The tag invalidated the CSS, but it only hit IE6, so it was effective if you were only targeting that browser.</p>
<pre><code>.class {
	width: 300px;
	_width: 320px;
	padding: 10px;
}
</code></pre>
<p>IE allowed for lots of other weird hacks, too. For example, the !important tag could be morphed to only work in IE7 and below if you put another exclamation point at the end of the word.</p>
<p>There was no reason it should have worked, but hacky HTML features like these were often necessary because Internet Explorer was so explicitly dominant.</p>
</div>
<div>
    
<p><img data-src="https://images.tedium.co/uploads/Internet-Explorer.png" width="900" height="620" alt="Internet Explorer" src="https://images.tedium.co/uploads/Internet-Explorer.png"></p>
<p><em>For irony’s sake, here’s a PNG of a non-transparent Internet Explorer logo, on a background associated with transparency.</em></p>
<h3>4. Using AlphaImageLoader to make PNGs transparent</h3>

<p>We take it for granted today, but there was a time when the most popular web browser in the world did not correctly support PNG files, one of the most popular file formats on the internet.</p>
<p>Despite IE having support for PNGs since version 4, it did not properly render PNGs in many cases, and was often quite broken, with the most egregious problem being the lack of transparency support in Internet Explorer 5 and 6.</p>
<p>As blogger <a href="https://perishablepress.com/css-hackz-series-png-fix-for-internet-explorer/">Jeff Starr of Perishable Press</a> writes, the use of Microsoft’s proprietary <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/internet-explorer/ie-developer/platform-apis/ms532969(v=vs.85)">AlphaImageLoader</a> filter, a technique Microsoft invented that no other browser-maker used—a common theme for Microsoft. As Starr wrote: </p>
<blockquote><p>Fortunately, there are plenty of hacks and workarounds designed to “fix” IE’s PNG image-display problem. Unfortunately, every currently available solution requires the use of Microsoft’s proprietary AlphaImageLoader transparency filter. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>As he shows in his example of the filter, it was possible to completely get around Microsoft’s poor support using this method:</p>
<pre><code>.png {
	cursor: pointer;
	background: none;
	/* filter applies only to IE5+/Win */
	filter:progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.AlphaImageLoader(enabled='true', sizingMethod='fixed', src='http://domain.tld/path/image.png');
}
.png[class] {
	/* [class] applies to non-IE browsers */
	background: url(http://domain.tld/path/image.png) no-repeat;
}
* html .png a {
	/* make links clickable in IE */
	position: relative;
	z-index: 999;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Small feature gaps like these really slowed down developers, who had to account for these hacks during the late 2000s and early 2010s.</p>
</div>
<div>
    
<p><img data-src="https://images.tedium.co/uploads/Outlook2003.png" width="575" height="449" alt="Outlook2003" src="https://images.tedium.co/uploads/Outlook2003.png"></p>
<p><em>Outlook 2003, one of the primary tools that relies on conditional comments. Fun fact: Outlook 2003 actually renders HTML better than most recent versions of Outlook. Who knew?</em></p>
<h3>5. Conditional Comments</h3>

<p>At some point, Internet Explorer required web developers to use so many hacks to properly code websites that Microsoft needed to intervene. And they did—with a feature that itself was a hack.</p>
<p>That intervention came via conditional comments. This tactic essentially reinvented HTML comments, which naturally weren’t designed to execute code, into something far more load-bearing. They broke commenting to fix broken HTML. Here’s an example:</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;!--[(if expression) (IE version)]&gt; 

   &lt;p&gt;Can’t believe you still use Internet Explorer!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;![endif]--&gt;

</code></pre>
<p>First introduced with Internet Explorer 5 and still required for more ambitious email designs in the Windows version of Microsoft Outlook, the technique became increasingly popular as web designers attempted to develop pages for newer browsers, while maintaining compatibility with older versions of IE.</p>
<p>Jens Oliver Meiert, a web-standards advocate, argued against conditional comments—and, surprisingly, in favor of more esoteric hacks. <a href="https://meiert.com/en/blog/why-conditional-comments-are-bad-repeat-bad/">In a 2007 post, he wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>No matter how you use CC, it will be necessary to adjust the HTML of each and every document or template once you focus on other Internet Explorer versions. This happens even if you’re the most visionary master of web development and there’s otherwise no need to update the structure of your documents. Remember that you strive for consistent separation of structure and formatting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Essentially, Microsoft had to introduce an HTML hack to allow older HTML hacks to continue to be useful as the company slowly evolved its web browser.</p>
<p>Conditional comments were removed after IE9, but a JavaScript feature, <a href="http://www.javascriptkit.com/javatutors/conditionalcompile.shtml">called conditional compilation</a>, could be used instead.</p>

<h3>6. Scalable Inman Flash Replacement (sIFR)</h3>

<p>The concept of web-safe fonts, <a href="https://tedium.co/2023/07/26/digital-typography-technology-truetype-history/">as we’ve previously written</a>, can also be blamed on Microsoft. The company created an initiative, Core Fonts for the Web, which essentially discouraged people from painting outside the lines—then let the initiative die out.</p>
<p>But paint outside the lines was something that people did, and often. And that led to a series of hacks, called font-replacement techniques, that offered more typography options. At first, this took the form of images, but that wasn’t enough, and that wasn’t accessible enough. Soon, they needed to pull out the big guns.</p>
<p>Enter Shaun Inman, who came up with the idea to replace fonts with small Adobe Flash files, built on demand, that replicated the fonts you <em>actually</em> wanted to use on your website. He had the spark, but it was Mike Davidson, a current executive at Microsoft, who made it sing. Davidson—who has spent time at companies like Twitter, NBC News, and Disney (where he famously helped make ESPN an early web design powerhouse)—made it possible with <a href="https://www.inkwell.ie/typography/sifr.html">sIFR</a> for the fonts to essentially scale as necessary, making the tool useful to lots of web designers for a time. (Later developers, like the programmer Mark Wubben, improved it even further.)</p>
<p><a href="https://mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2004/08/sifr">At the time he released sIFR in 2004</a>, Davidson pointed out that what he had built was essentially a solution to a problem that standards bodies have done little about—the need to allow fonts not owned by the end user to display in fancy formats:</p>
<blockquote><p>With this newfound ability to display true versions of typefaces in web browsers, you’d think typography on the web would be exploding. Well, it’s not. Why? Because no one has solved the second problem yet: how to deliver custom typefaces to people who don’t have them installed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This obviously was a way station to a real solution, and one that did not last in large part because Flash did not make the leap to mobile. It took another half a decade for a real solution to the font problem to show itself.</p>

<h3>7. The preheader text hack</h3>

<p>These days, HTML emails carry IE’s hacky-code torch—and over time, they’ve put their own wrinkles on the process. Example: The preheader, the short snippet of text exposed by email clients that effectively works as the subhed or deck to the email.</p>
<p>If you don’t work in email marketing, you probably don’t realize how important this tag actually is, and also that it can be somewhat inelegant for the email client to, say, pull up an HTML tag.</p>
<p>Enter the preheader text hack. This thing is designed to do one thing: Add some extra space between your intended preheader, usually the first text in the email, and any unrelated content. How does it work? Essentially, you put a bunch of HTML character codes between the message and the next text passage.</p>
<p>It’s taken many forms over the years, but here’s the version that <a href="https://www.litmus.com/blog/the-little-known-preview-text-hack-you-may-want-to-use-in-every-email">the email firm Litmus recommends</a>:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div style="display: none; max-height: 0px; overflow: hidden;"&gt;
Insert hidden preheader text here.
&lt;/div&gt;
   
&lt;!-- Insert &amp;#847;&amp;zwnj;&amp;nbsp; hack after hidden preview text --&gt;
&lt;div style="display: none; max-height: 0px; overflow: hidden;"&gt;
&amp;#847; &amp;zwnj; &amp;nbsp; &amp;#8199; &amp;shy; &amp;#847; &amp;zwnj; &amp;nbsp; &amp;#8199; &amp;shy; &amp;#847; &amp;zwnj; &amp;nbsp; &amp;#8199; &amp;shy; &amp;#847; &amp;zwnj; &amp;nbsp; &amp;#8199; &amp;shy; &amp;#847; &amp;zwnj; &amp;nbsp; &amp;#8199; &amp;shy; &amp;#847; &amp;zwnj; &amp;nbsp; &amp;#8199; &amp;shy; &amp;#847; &amp;zwnj; &amp;nbsp; &amp;#8199; &amp;shy; &amp;#847; &amp;zwnj; &amp;nbsp; &amp;#8199; &amp;shy;

<h3>8. Google Chrome Frame</h3>

<p>In many ways, this is more a competition hack than an HTML hack, but it’s an endlessly clever solution to a real problem that emerged in the business world: Some people, especially in offices with tough IT departments, wanted to use more modern browsers, but these companies were reliant on technologies built around IE6 that did not work with any other browser. It could have prevented Chrome’s success, so they solved the problem by creating a browser plugin that literally replaced your IE6 renderer with a modern Chrome one. </p>
<p>As Google <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2013/06/retiring-chrome-frame.html">explained about the plugin</a> in a 2014 blog post:</p>
<blockquote><p>But in 2009, many people were using browsers that lagged behind the leading edge. In order to reach the broadest base of users, developers often had to either build multiple versions of their applications or not use the new capabilities at all. We created Chrome Frame—a secure plug-in that brings a modern engine to old versions of Internet Explorer—to allow developers to bring better experiences to more users, even those who were unable to move to a more capable browser.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There were competitive reasons for Chrome Frame to exist beyond increasing Chrome’s uptake. Google was working on tools like Google Wave and YouTube that required HTML5 features, and having to support IE6 was holding them back.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the browser-in-a-browser trick worked extremely well, as Chrome became utterly dominant in the five years that the plugin was on the market.</p>
</div>
<div>

<h3>9. The Webkit-only selector hack</h3>

<p>When Apple’s Safari web browser was first released, it was a breath of fresh air for web developers. Built on a ground-up engine rooted in the open-source community, it had stronger support for HTML and CSS standards than many other browsers of its kind upon its initial release. (Anyone who loves rounded corners in CSS should know Safari had them first.)</p>
<p>It still does—and for people who code emails, it is beautiful in most cases because Apple Mail, which uses WebKit, generally just works.</p>
<p>But as time has gone on, it’s gained some problems. One of the biggest: Apple’s Safari release schedule is generally built around Apple’s Mac and iOS release schedules, meaning it lags behind the rest of the industry. Additionally, developers have accused Apple of ignoring bugs or holding back features that undermine its competitive position.</p>
<p>As a Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/o5k8gb/rant_i_cant_stand_developing_for_safari_anymore/">wrote a couple of years ago in a viral thread</a>: “Oh my god. Even when they implement an API, it’s riddled with bugs they never fix. Or they do it fine, then break it later.”</p>
<p>So when users have to write some Safari specific CSS code to work around Apple, they do this:</p>
<pre><code>@supports (-webkit-appearance:none) {}
</code></pre>
<p>It should be noted that this works in early versions of Chrome, which started on Webkit.</p>

<h3>10. Responsive design</h3>

<p>In many ways, responsive design is a hack that ended up getting a corner office in the realm of HTML.</p>
<p>To understand how responsive design is so important to the way web design works, it’s important to understand that there was a major debate in web design throughout the 2000s. Essentially, everyone wanted to have a good way to design webpages with three columns that went all the way to the bottom. This was a layout that worked well using traditional HTML tables, but wasn’t technically semantic and did not work using CSS.</p>
<p>Numerous solutions emerged during this period, many faking it with fake columns enforced by a background image. Eventually, the interest in responsive design turned into grid-based layout, something that CSS came to support.</p>
<p>The point that held this up was browser support, particularly on the Internet Explorer front. But eventually, as smartphones became popular, the “<a href="https://web.dev/patterns/layout/holy-grail">Holy Grail layout</a>,” as it was long called, no longer made sense. People suddenly had to invest lots of money in mobile websites that they did not have to previously.</p>
<p>But then <a href="https://ethanmarcotte.com/">Ethan Marcotte</a>, a web developer and writer for <em>A List Apart</em>, came along and <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/">pointed web designers towards a new holy grail</a>—the use of media queries to reposition websites to match the format. This looked like magic when it first came out, in part because it used obscure, little-known web technologies, particularly media queries.</p>
<p>It was a hack just like HTML tables were, but unlike HTML tables, it actually worked within the parameters of what the HTML standards folks wanted. It ultimately changed web design forever—for the better.</p>
</div>
<div>
    
<p><strong>It’s fascinating to me</strong> that the intentions of HTML and how it actually works ended up differing so dramatically.</p>
<p>In many ways, <a href="https://www.xml.com/pub/a/w3j/s1.people.html">to hear HTML tables maverick David Siegel explain it</a>, the standards bodies wanted HTML to work like RSS—where design had no bearing on the final product, where the user ultimately was the driver. Other protocols created around the same time as HTML, like Gopher, worked like this.</p>
<p>But that philosophy clearly lost, in large part because of two things: First, it deeply underestimated how creative the internet’s users were, and second, it was a complete nonstarter for the commercial internet, which (for understandable reasons) leans heavily on visual language.</p>
<p>For decades, design nerds and user interface pros tried to put their imprint on the internet, despite all the weird code that required. It’s impressive that they actually pulled it off, given all that.</p>
<p>Today, I was trying to do something with some code I was working on—to put a transparent gradient over a block of text to make it fade out. This is trivial in standard HTML and CSS, but I was working in email. I tried seemingly a dozen things, but eventually I found my solution—a random HTML table glitch, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1829541/how-to-put-text-over-an-image-without-absolute-positioning-or-setting-the-image">highlighted by a StackOverflow commenter way back in 2009</a>, that should not work, but somehow does.</p>
<p>“I know, I deserve a downvote for this,” the guy wrote. I disagree.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div lang="en">
    
    

    
    <h2 id="code-is-read-more-than-written">Code is read more than written</h2>

<p>This phrase is, by now, common programmer knowledge, a reminder that the person first writing a piece of code shouldn’t buy convenience at the expense of the people who will have to read it and modify it in the future. More generally, <em>code is read more than written</em> conveys that it’s usually a good investment to make the code maintainable by keeping it simple, writing tests and documentation, etc. It’s about having perspective over the software development cycle.</p>

<p>Let me express this idea more succinctly:</p>

<p>
<code>maintainer &gt; author</code>
</p>

<p>I think this line of thought can be extended beyond code-writing and used as a rule of thumb to identify problems and make decisions.</p>

<h2 id="code-is-used-more-than-read">Code is used more than read</h2>

<p>Code is a means to an end. Software should have a purpose, it’s supposed to provide a service to some user. It doesn’t matter how well written or maintainable the code is, nor how sophisticated the technology it uses if it doesn’t fulfill its purpose and provides a good experience to the user:</p>

<p>
<code>user &gt; maintainer &gt; author</code>
</p>

<p>Or, since we won’t need to distinguish between developer roles anymore:</p>

<p>
<code>user &gt; dev</code>
</p>

<p>This is why, instead of guessing or asking what they need, it’s best to put the program in front of the users early and frequently and to incorporate what we learn from their feedback.</p>

<p>This is a strong mental model, just keeping the users in mind during development can get us quite far. It’s approximately how I learned the job and how I understood it for the first half of my career.</p>

<h2 id="code-is-run-more-than-read">Code is run more than read</h2>

<p>When I say “run” I don’t just mean executing a program; I mean operating it in production, with all that it entails: deploying, upgrading, observing, auditing, monitoring, fixing, decommissioning, etc. As Dan McKinley <a href="https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology">puts it</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is basically always the case that the long-term costs of keeping a system working reliably vastly exceed any inconveniences you encounter while building it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We can incorporate this idea into our little model:</p>

<p>
<code>user &gt; ops &gt; dev</code>
</p>

<p>It took me a while to fully grasp this because, in my experience, much of the software being built never really gets to production, at least not at a significant scale. Most software is built on assumptions that never get tested. But when you run your code in production, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">KISS</a> mantra takes on a new dimension. It’s not just about code anymore; it’s about reducing the moving parts and understanding their failure modes. It’s about shipping stuff and ensuring it works even when it fails.</p>

<h2 id="also-theres-business">Also, there’s business</h2>

<p>I said that keeping the users in mind during development can get us very far. This works under the assumption that software that’s useful and works well, software of value to users, will be of value to the organization. It’s a convenient abstraction for developers: we produce good, working software, and the business deals with turning it into money. And it mostly works, especially for consumer and enterprise software. But, eventually, that abstraction proves to be an oversimplification, and we can benefit from incorporating some business perspective into our working process:</p>

<p>
<code>biz &gt; user &gt; ops &gt; dev</code>
</p>

<p>The most obvious example is budget: we don’t have infinite resources to satisfy the user needs, so we need to measure costs and benefits. There’s marketing, there’s deadlines. There are stakeholders and investors. There are personal interests and politics at play. Decisions that make sense for our software, our team or our users considered in isolation, but not when we consider the organization as a whole. Sometimes, we need to work on what generates revenue, not what pleases the user. I’ll get back to this.</p>

<h2 id="smells">Smells</h2>

<p>We arrived at a little model that expresses the relative importance of various factors in software development, one that can perhaps help us see the bigger picture and focus on what matters. Now I want to look at some common software development dysfunctions and see how they map to the model.</p>

<h3 id="unmaintainable-code">Unmaintainable code</h3>

<p>
<code>author &gt; maintainer</code>
</p>

<p>This is where we started. This is clever and lazy code that turns into spaghetti and haunted forests, this is premature optimizations, this is only-carlos-can-touch-that-module, etc.</p>

<h3 id="unusable-software">Unusable software</h3>

<p>
<code>dev &gt; user</code>
</p>

<p>Software from teams that don’t learn from their users or that put technology first. Over-engineered programs, “modernizations” that degrade the user experience, web apps that break the browser features, etc.</p>

<h3 id="works-on-my-machine">Works on my machine</h3>

<p>
<code>dev &gt; ops</code>
</p>

<p>Software that wasn’t designed with its operation in mind. This is overly complicated software with lots of moving parts, fancy databases for small data loads, microservice ecosystems managed by a single small team. Software prematurely architected for scale. Software designed by different people than the ones woken up at midnight when it breaks.</p>

<h3 id="the-right-thing">The right thing</h3>

<p>
<code>dev &gt; biz</code>
</p>

<p>Code considered as an end in itself. Software built by pretentious artisans, musicians of the Titanic, and <a href="https://www.dreamsongs.com/RiseOfWorseIsBetter.html">Lisp Hackers</a>.</p>

<h3 id="resume-driven-development">Resume-driven development</h3>

<p>
<code>dev &gt; *</code>
</p>

<p>Software produced when there’s nothing at stake and developers get to do whatever they want.</p>

<h3 id="imaginary-software">Imaginary software</h3>

<p><code>biz &gt; user &gt; <del>ops &gt;</del> dev</code></p>

<p>This is software that’s built but rarely (or never) gets to production. I call this <em>imaginary software</em>. Charity Majors <a href="https://twitter.com/mipsytipsy/status/1308641574448803840?lang=es">calls it</a> living a lie.</p>

<p><code>biz &gt; <del>user &gt;</del> ops &gt; dev</code></p>

<p>Another kind of imaginary software is the one that doesn’t have users. (But scales). This is software that doesn’t solve a problem, or solves the wrong problem, perhaps nobody’s problem. Software that results from taking some hyped tech and hammering everything with it until something vaguely resembling a use case comes up.</p>

<h3 id="late-capitalism">Late capitalism</h3>

<p><code><del>biz &gt;</del> user &gt; ops &gt; dev</code></p>

<p>Venture-backed software without a business model or whose business model is grow-until-monopoly-then-exploit-users.</p>

<h2 id="an-elephant">An elephant</h2>

<p>If you didn’t rage-close the browser tab yet, let me wrap up by going back to this:</p>

<p>
<code>biz &gt; user</code>
</p>

<p>This one has ramifications that can be hard to swallow.</p>

<p>As I mentioned above, the way I learned the job, software was about solving problems for end users. This is summarized in one of the final tips of <em>The Pragmatic Programmer,</em> saying that our goal is to <em>delight users, not just deliver code</em>. But, since I started working as a programmer, and as software became ubiquitous, I’ve seen this assumption become increasingly hard to uphold.</p>

<p>There’s a lot of software being produced that just doesn’t care about its users, or that manipulates them, or that turns them into the product. And this isn’t limited to social media: as a user, I can’t even book a room, order food, or click on the Windows start button without popups trying to grab my attention; I can’t make a Google search without getting back a pile of garbage.</p>

<p>There’s a mismatch between what we thought doing a good job was and what a significant part of the industry considers profitable, and I think that explains the increasing discomfort of many software professionals. And while we can’t just go back to ignoring the economic realities of our discipline, perhaps we should take a stronger ethical stand not to harm users. Acknowledging that the user may not always come before the business, but that the business shouldn’t unconditionally come first, either:</p>

<p>

<code>biz &gt; ops &gt; dev</code><br>
<code>biz ≹ user</code>

<p>Choosing good colors for your charts is hard. This article tries to make it easier.</p>



<p>I want you to feel more confident in your color choices. And if you have no sense of color at all, here’s my attempt to help you find good ones anyway. We’ll talk about common color mistakes I see out there in the wild and how to avoid them.</p>



<p>This is not the right article for you if you’re trying to find good gradients or shades. But if you need to find beautiful, distinctive colors for different <strong>categories (e.g., continents, industries, bird species)</strong> for your line charts, pie charts, stacked bar charts, etc., then read on.</p>

<h4 id="0">Before we start…</h4>



<p>I will mention saturation, brightness, and hue a lot. The HSB (<strong>H</strong>ue, <strong>S</strong>aturation, <strong>B</strong>rightness) or HSV (<strong>H</strong>ue, <strong>S</strong>aturation, <strong>V</strong>alue) color spaces work fairly well to check them:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Hue</strong> ranges from 0° to 360° — that’s your typical color wheel: <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span></li><li><strong>Saturation</strong> ranges from 0% (gray) to 100% (super duper colorful!!): <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span></li><li><strong>Brightness/Value</strong> ranges from 0% (black) to 100% (the actual color): <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span></li></ul>



<p>To convert your colors from HEX (e.g. <code>#cc0000</code>) or RGB (e.g. <code>rgb(207, 176, 58)</code>) to HSB/HSV, use a tool like <a href="http://colorizer.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>colorizer.org</strong></a>.</p>



<p>A relative of HSB/HSV is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HCL_color_space" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HCL</a> color space. It uses the same parameters (<strong>H</strong>ue, <strong>C</strong>hroma = saturation, <strong>L</strong>ightness), but is closer to “how we really see colors.” <a href="https://academy.datawrapper.de/article/255-how-to-pick-colors-in-datawrapper" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Datawrapper</strong> uses the HCL color space</a> for its color picker:</p>

<p>But since you won’t find HCL in Adobe Photoshop or <a href="http://colorizer.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">colorizer.org</a>, every time I mention degrees (like 0°) or percentages, I’ll be talking about the HSB/HSV color space.</p>



<p>All right, let’s do this:</p>

Like this <span>⬤</span>, this <span>⬤</span>, this <span>⬤</span>, this <span>⬤</span> and this <span>⬤</span>. And we haven’t even talked about orange and yellow.</p>

<p>There’s no need to rely on hues from all around the color wheel like <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span> for your visualizations. It will look more professional — and therefore more trustworthy — when it only uses a few hues and their neighbors.</p>



<p>Here’s where it becomes a good idea to actually look at a color wheel. You can use <a href="https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adobe Color</a> or <a href="https://www.sessions.edu/color-calculator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Color Calculator</a> to do so.</p>

<p>Lots of these tools let you choose different harmonies. One of them is called “square” or “tetradic.” <strong>Don’t use it.</strong> It will result in too many hues —&nbsp;and we’re on a mission to avoid that.</p>



<figure><video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" src="https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/200805_goodcolors20.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>In the video above, I used the color tool <a href="https://paletton.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paletton</a> to start with a tetradic harmony and then decrease the distance. Note how much more beautiful the color combinations become.</p>



<p>If the distance becomes small enough, you’re basically using <strong>complementary</strong> colors. And that’s a great choice! Lots of complementary color pairs look fantastic together. <strong>When in doubt, use complementary colors and their neighbors.</strong></p>



<p>So let’s do this —&nbsp;this time with Adobe Color:</p>

<p>Our colors are opposite each other on the color wheel, so they’re clearly complementary. Yay! But they’re also unusable: The two oranges are way too similar. And everything looks so… bright.</p>

<p>Saturation and brightness are as important as hue. In fact, you can create new colors when you change just the saturation and brightness. Here are two color pairs with the same hue, just different saturation and lightness: <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span> / <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span>. (If you change the hue just a tiny bit, you’ll achieve even better results: <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span> / <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span>.)</p>



<p>Let’s come back to our color combination: <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span>. After playing around with the saturation and darkness, it becomes this:</p>







<p>I desaturated the light blue <span>⬤</span> and the lighter orange <span>⬤</span> and made every color darker except the lighter orange. Heck yeah, we can work with that!</p>



<p>So if your color combination doesn’t look awesome yet, don’t immediately add another hue. <strong>Change the saturation and lightness first and see if that’s better.</strong></p>



<p>That’s what I did to all of these color palettes: <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span> and <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span> and <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span>. They’re all roughly complementary, and they all come with different saturations and lightness. That’s what makes them work.</p>

<p>There’s a complementary color combination that is especially loved by data visualization designers: <strong>yellow/orange/red and blue</strong>. Scroll through graphics portfolios like this one from the <a href="https://multimedia.scmp.com/culture/article/SCMP-printed-graphics-memory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South China Morning Post</a> or this one by <a href="https://infographics.economist.com/2019/AChristmasGiftForYou/AYearInGraphicDetail.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Economist (PDF)</a>, and you’ll notice that they use these colors far more often than colors like purple or green.</p>

<p>That’s because these warm colors and blue are super versatile for categories. Yellow and orange and red look very pleasing together, but people will still perceive them as different: <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span> —&nbsp;which is exactly what we want for categorical colors. And blue is more flexible than any other hue. Lots of blues, no matter if dark <span>⬤</span> or light <span>⬤</span> or saturated <span>⬤</span> or not saturated <span>⬤</span>, look pleasing, calming, and professional.</p>



<p>And they are accessible: colorblind people can easily distinguish blue and orange/red from each other.</p>



<p>So when in doubt, use an orange/red with blue.</p>



<h4 id="5">When using green, make it a yellow or blue one</h4>

<p>Forest green covers a full sixth of the color wheel, from approximately 90° <span>⬤</span> to 150° <span>⬤</span>, with 120° as its peak <span>⬤</span>. However, you will find few well-designed visualizations that use it. Why is that?</p>



<p>First, forest green is just very dark. And lightening the forest green means going into an awkward neon <span>⬤</span>. So you need to lighten <em>and</em> desaturate green enormously — more than other color —&nbsp;to get to a nice one. That’s exactly what the Washington Post does with their green <span>⬤</span> here: </p>

<p>It’s a 142° green, but only 14% saturated. Here’s what the same hue with the same brightness would look like 100% saturated: <span>⬤</span>. Yikes.</p>



<p>And remember our colorblind friends: A pure green in combination with red, orange, or brown is hard for them to distinguish.</p>



<p>So when using green, make it a bit yellow or a bit blue. You can see this in the examples at the top of this article: All of the greens except FiveThirtyEight’s <span>⬤</span> have a hue greater than 160° (= bluer) <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span> or less than 60° (= more yellow) <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span>. Nadieh uses both yellow-green and blue-green in this project we’ve already seen:</p>

<p>Here’s an example: In HSV/HSB, the <strong>H</strong>ue value of this bright blue <span>⬤</span> is 180°, the <strong>S</strong>aturation value is 67%, and the <strong>L</strong>ightness value is 91%. You can also check the RGB values of your color: If at least two of the values are the same, they’re “pure”. For example, our <span>⬤</span> is a <code>rgb(77, 232, 232)</code>.</p>



<p>To make your colors look more natural and pleasing to your readers’ eyes, you can either tone down the saturation of pure colors or make them darker. <strong>If you want to have bright, saturated colors, rely on mixed colors</strong> at least 5-10° away from the pure hues.</p>



<p>In the image above, the red and orange, the blues and the greens have the same saturation and lightness. The only difference is the hue: The red <span>⬤</span> (0°), blue <span>⬤</span> (240°), and green <span>⬤</span> (120°) look more colorful than the orange <span>⬤</span> (40°), medium blue <span>⬤</span> (211°), and blue-ish green <span>⬤</span> (170°).</p>



<h4 id="7">Avoid bright, saturated colors</h4>

<p>But if you compare the colors from these examples with colors like <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span>, you see how the former ones are all less saturated or darker. A 100% saturated and 100% bright green <span>⬤</span> becomes less saturated in the New York Times <span>⬤</span>, and less saturated <em>and</em> darker in both the Bloomberg article <span>⬤</span> and the Pudding article <span>⬤</span>. </p>



<p>They have the same fun, attention-grabbing effect as neon colors have, while being easier on the eye.</p>



<p>This works more or less because the people at The Pudding, The New York Times, and Bloomberg are great designers. <strong>When in doubt, avoid 100% saturation combined with 100% lightness.</strong></p>

<p>I sometimes see charts —&nbsp;especially area charts —&nbsp;where neighboring elements have the same lightness. You can easily check this: Just convert your colors to black &amp; white (e.g., with an external colorblindness simulator or with our <a href="https://twitter.com/Datawrapper/status/1298293123584536578" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Datawrapper colorblind check</a>). If they all have the same gray, they’re the same lightness.</p>



<p>For example, the <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span> from the far left chart look like <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span> in grayscale.</p>



<p>To avoid that dull and eye-hurting experience, you have two options:</p>



<ul><li>“Get it right in black &amp; white”: change the darkness of each area, making some brighter and some darker, like so: <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span>. They look like this in grayscale: <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span></li><li>Separate the areas, e.g., with a white border</li></ul>



<p>I highly recommend the first option (you can still put a white border around it if you like the style): The colors will look more dynamic, and colorblind people will thank you. Actually, everyone will thank you, regardless of their color-seeing abilities.</p>



<p>In fact, a valid way to pick colors for categorical data is to pick colors from gradients like these ones:</p>

<p>All these gradients move smoothly from light to dark, so colors you pick from there will all have a different lightness: <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span> or <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span>.

<p>In your visualizations, you often want colors to stand out. There are different ways to achieve that. Colors stand out:</p>



<ul><li>because they’re way darker <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span> </li><li>because they’re way lighter <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span></li><li>because they’re more saturated <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span></li><li>because they’re more “pure” <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span></li></ul>



<p>But you usually just want one or two colors to stand out. Most of your colors are supposed to be <strong>more or less equally attention-grabbing</strong>.</p>



<p>If you’re using colors with different lightness (“Get it right in black &amp; white”), you’ll need to balance them out. <strong>Try to desaturate bright colors. Put more saturation in dark colors.</strong></p>



<p>Or choose a less pure hue: in the image above, the green <span>⬤</span> and blue <span>⬤</span> are very pure, so I darkened them. (Here’s how they look with 100% brightness: <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span>.)</p>



<p>I then wanted to bring a red in… but the bright red would have been too intense as a pure hue (at 0°) <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span>. So I had two options:</p>



<ol><li>simply darken it: <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span>.</li><li>move the hue (and just the hue) to 30° to make it more orange <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span>.</li></ol>



<p>I chose the second option to make it look a bit more friendly. But both options work.</p>

<p>A surprising number of charts on bright backgrounds use very pastel-ish colors. They’re often not very saturated, and awfully light.</p>



<p>That comes with problems: If you work with small areas like lines and dots, light and desaturated colors can be hard for your readers to distinguish. But even if legibility is not an issue —&nbsp;e.g. for bigger areas — your visualizations should have enough visual contrast with the background to confidently communicate: “Hey, I’m here, and I have something to say.”</p>



<p>Here’s what to do when your colors are too desaturated and light <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span>:</p>



<ul><li>Increase the saturation: <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span></li><li>Make them darker: <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span></li><li>Or do both for the best result: <span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span><span>⬤</span></li></ul>



<p>Of course, that’s also a matter of taste. But if you’re not sure if your colors are too pastel-ish, simply try to make them more saturated and darker. Just see how it feels. And if it feels good, keep it.</p>

<p>The opposite is true, too: Don’t make your colors too dark and saturated when you’re using a bright background. If in doubt, try it out. Make your colors lighter, pull some saturation out of them and see how it feels.</p>

<p>Once you become more confident with colors, colorful backgrounds can seem like a good idea. But they come with two big drawbacks: First, they easily distract from your data. Second, they’re limiting your potential color palette and are therefore hard to work with. In fact, the more saturated your background, the harder it gets —&nbsp;so desaturated colors are your best bet. Here are some rules of thumbs for the HSB/HSV color space:</p>



<ul><li>If you want a light background, stay away from colors below 95% lightness and above 7% saturation.</li><li>If you want a dark background, stay below 20% saturation. Also, <a href="https://ianstormtaylor.com/design-tip-never-use-black/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don’t go full black</a> —&nbsp;keep your lightness between 10% and 25%.</li></ul>



<h4 id="13">Copy colors, or understand them</h4>



<p>Picking good colors is hard. It’s totally ok to be bad with colors, to keep being bad with colors, and to just copy colors. Seriously, there’s no shame in stealing. <a href="https://blog.datawrapper.de/colorguide/"><strong>I wrote a whole article</strong></a> about where to get inspiration for colors: From movies, artists, color palettes others have created, etc. (And may I add: Other data visualizations are an excellent source.)</p>



<p>If you do want to build a better intuitive understanding of which colors fit well together, try this: Analyze them. Some ways to do that include:</p>

<ul><li>Select a picture with colors you consider beautiful, like an art piece or photo of nature. Then pick colors out of them with an eyedropper tool, e.g., in Photoshop or <a href="https://image-color.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>image-color.com</strong></a>. Try to use them in your next chart.</li><li>Install <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/capture.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Adobe Capture</strong></a>, which is the same idea but for “live images”: It lets you capture colors from your environment. (It’s fascinating to see how desaturated many colors are around us!)</li><li>Play “manual color picker”: <strong>Look up your screen. Which colors do you see?</strong> How dark and how saturated are there? Which hues are close by; which ones are opposite on the color wheel?</li><li>Pick colors from beautiful data visualizations. <strong>Change a few colors.</strong> Do they still work well together?</li></ul>



<p>Also, the next time you’re creating a data visualization and you’re not happy with your colors, <strong>analyze them in the HSV/HSB color space</strong>, e.g., with <a href="http://colorizer.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">colorizer.org</a>:</p>



<ul><li>How <strong>saturated</strong> are they —&nbsp;and do they look better if you increase or decrease the saturation by a few (or a lot of) percentage points?</li><li>Which <strong>hue</strong> value do they have? What happens if you change the hue by just a few degrees?</li><li>Are your colors differently <strong>bright</strong>?</li></ul>



<p>With time, your understanding will move from “that’s beautiful, but I don’t know why” to “that’s beautiful, because…” And you’ll find that you can break more and more of these rules I explained here —&nbsp;and still create great color combinations.</p>

                    <p>A U.K. woman was photographed standing in a mirror where her reflections didn't match, but not because of a glitch in the Matrix. Instead, it's a simple <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/iphone" title="iPhone" data-kpt="1">iPhone</a> computational photography mistake.
</p><p>Thanks to technological advancements, photography has come a long way from flash bulbs and film. Every time the iPhone shutter button is clicked, <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/23/03/16/iphone-vs-android-two-different-photography-and-machine-learning-approaches">billions of operations</a> occur in an instant that results in a photo.
</p><p>A U.K. comedian and actor named Tessa Coates was trying on wedding dresses when a shocking photo of her was taken, according to her Instagram post <a href="https://petapixel.com/2023/11/16/one-in-a-million-iphone-photo-shows-two-versions-of-the-same-woman/">shared by</a> <em>PetaPixel</em>. The photo shows Coates in a dress in front of two mirrors, but each of the three versions of her had a different pose.
</p><p>One mirror showed her with her arms down, the other mirror showed her hands joined at her waist, and her real self was standing with her left arm at her side. To anyone who doesn't know better, this could prove to be quite a shocking image.
</p><p>What's actually occurred here is a mistake in Apple's computational photography pipeline. The camera wouldn't realize it was taking a photo of a mirror, so it treated the three versions of Coates as different people.
</p><p>Coates was moving when the photo was taken, so when the shutter was pressed, many differing images were captured in that instant. Apple's algorithm stitches the photos together, choosing the best versions for saturation, contrast, detail, and lack of blur.
</p><p>The final composite image should be the best, most realistic interpretation of that moment. However, since there was a mirror present, the algorithm determined that different moments shown in each mirror were the best for that reflection. That's what resulted in three different Tessas.
</p><p>This result can be recreated on any recent iPhone and many kinds of smartphone due to the limitations of <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/10/02/inside-apples-deep-fusion-the-iphone-11-and-pros-computational-photography-feature">computational photography</a> dealing with mirrors. Younger generations have figured this phenomenon out and used it to generate silly images for social media.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker">https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38482007">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-target="readme-toc.content">
            <article itemprop="text"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Marker</h2>
<p dir="auto">Marker converts PDF, EPUB, and MOBI to markdown.  It's 10x faster than nougat, more accurate on most documents, and has low hallucination risk.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Support for a range of PDF documents (optimized for books and scientific papers)</li>
<li>Removes headers/footers/other artifacts</li>
<li>Converts most equations to latex</li>
<li>Formats code blocks and tables</li>
<li>Support for multiple languages (although most testing is done in English).  See <code>settings.py</code> for a language list.</li>
<li>Works on GPU, CPU, or MPS</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How it works</h2>
<p dir="auto">Marker is a pipeline of deep learning models:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Extract text, OCR if necessary (heuristics, tesseract)</li>
<li>Detect page layout (<a href="https://huggingface.co/vikp/layout_segmenter" rel="nofollow">layout segmenter</a>, <a href="https://huggingface.co/vikp/column_detector" rel="nofollow">column detector</a>)</li>
<li>Clean and format each block (heuristics, <a href="https://huggingface.co/facebook/nougat-base" rel="nofollow">nougat</a>)</li>
<li>Combine blocks and postprocess complete text (heuristics, <a href="https://huggingface.co/vikp/pdf_postprocessor_t5" rel="nofollow">pdf_postprocessor</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Relying on autoregressive forward passes to generate text is slow and prone to hallucination/repetition.  From the nougat paper: <code>We observed [repetition] in 1.5% of pages in the test set, but the frequency increases for out-of-domain documents.</code>  In my anecdotal testing, repetitions happen on 5%+ of out-of-domain (non-arXiv) pages.</p>
<p dir="auto">Nougat is an amazing model, but I wanted a faster and more general purpose solution. Marker is 10x faster and has low hallucination risk because it only passes equation blocks through an LLM forward pass.</p>

<li><code>poetry install</code></li>
<li><code>poetry shell</code> to activate your poetry venv</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2>
<p dir="auto">First, some configuration:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Set your torch device in the <code>local.env</code> file.  For example, <code>TORCH_DEVICE=cuda</code> or <code>TORCH_DEVICE=mps</code>.  <code>cpu</code> is the default.
<ul dir="auto">
<li>If using GPU, set <code>INFERENCE_RAM</code> to your GPU VRAM (per GPU).  For example, if you have 16 GB of VRAM, set <code>INFERENCE_RAM=16</code>.</li>
<li>Depending on your document types, marker's average memory usage per task can vary slightly.  You can configure <code>VRAM_PER_TASK</code> to adjust this if you notice tasks failing with GPU out of memory errors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>By default, the final editor model is off.  Turn it on with <code>ENABLE_EDITOR_MODEL</code>.</li>
<li>Inspect the settings in <code>marker/settings.py</code>.  You can override any settings in the <code>local.env</code> file, or by setting environment variables.</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Convert a single file</h2>
<p dir="auto">Run <code>convert_single.py</code>, like this:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="python convert_single.py /path/to/file.pdf /path/to/output.md --parallel_factor 2 --max_pages 10"><pre><code>python convert_single.py /path/to/file.pdf /path/to/output.md --parallel_factor 2 --max_pages 10
</code></pre></div>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>--parallel_factor</code> is how much to increase batch size and parallel OCR workers by.  Higher numbers will take more VRAM and CPU, but process faster.  Set to 1 by default.</li>
<li><code>--max_pages</code> is the maximum number of pages to process.  Omit this to convert the entire document.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Make sure the <code>DEFAULT_LANG</code> setting is set appropriately for your document.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Convert multiple files</h2>
<p dir="auto">Run <code>convert.py</code>, like this:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="python convert.py /path/to/input/folder /path/to/output/folder --workers 10 --max 10 --metadata_file /path/to/metadata.json --min_length 10000"><pre><code>python convert.py /path/to/input/folder /path/to/output/folder --workers 10 --max 10 --metadata_file /path/to/metadata.json --min_length 10000
</code></pre></div>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>--workers</code> is the number of pdfs to convert at once.  This is set to 1 by default, but you can increase it to increase throughput, at the cost of more CPU/GPU usage. Parallelism will not increase beyond <code>INFERENCE_RAM / VRAM_PER_TASK</code> if you're using GPU.</li>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Benchmarks</h2>
<p dir="auto">Benchmarking PDF extraction quality is hard.  I've created a test set by finding books and scientific papers that have a pdf version and a latex source.  I convert the latex to text, and compare the reference to the output of text extraction methods.</p>
<p dir="auto">Benchmarks show that marker is 10x faster than nougat, and more accurate outside arXiv (nougat was trained on arXiv data).  We show naive text extraction (pulling text out of the pdf with no processing) for comparison.</p>

<p dir="auto">Peak GPU memory usage during the benchmark is <code>3.3GB</code> for nougat, and <code>3.1GB</code> for marker.  Benchmarks were run on an A6000.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Throughput</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Marker takes about 2GB of VRAM on average per task, so you can convert 24 documents in parallel on an A6000.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Running your own benchmarks</h2>
<p dir="auto">You can benchmark the performance of marker on your machine.  First, download the benchmark data <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WiN4K2-jQfwyQMe4wSSurbpz3hxo2fG9/view?usp=drive_link" rel="nofollow">here</a> and unzip.</p>
<p dir="auto">Then run <code>benchmark.py</code> like this:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="python benchmark.py data/pdfs data/references report.json --nougat"><pre><code>python benchmark.py data/pdfs data/references report.json --nougat
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This will benchmark marker against other text extraction methods.  It sets up batch sizes for nougat and marker to use a similar amount of GPU RAM for each.</p>
<p dir="auto">Omit <code>--nougat</code> to exclude nougat from the benchmark.  I don't recommend running nougat on CPU, since it is very slow.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Limitations</h2>
<p dir="auto">PDF is a tricky format, so marker will not always work perfectly.  Here are some known limitations that are on the roadmap to address:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Marker will convert fewer equations to latex than nougat.  This is because it has to first detect equations, then convert them without hallucation.</li>
<li>Whitespace and indentations are not always respected.</li>
<li>Not all lines/spans will be joined properly.</li>
<li>Only languages similar to English (Spanish, French, German, Russian, etc) are supported.  Languages with different character sets (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, etc) are not.</li>
<li>This works best on digital PDFs that won't require a lot of OCR.  It's optimized for speed, and limited OCR is used to fix errors.</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Commercial usage</h2>
<p dir="auto">Due to the licensing of the underlying models like layoutlmv3 and nougat, this is only suitable for noncommercial usage.</p>
<p dir="auto">I'm building a version that can be used commercially, by stripping out the dependencies below. If you would like to get early access, email me at <a href="mailto:marker@vikas.sh">marker@vikas.sh</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Here are the non-commercial/restrictive dependencies:</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Upon its release in late 2022, ChatGPT has brought a seismic shift in the entire landscape of AI, both in research and commerce. Through instruction-tuning a large language model (LLM) with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback, it showed that a model could answer human questions and follow instructions on a broad panel of tasks. Following this success, interests in LLMs have intensified, with new LLMs flourishing at frequent interval across academia and industry, including many start-ups focused on LLMs. While closed-source LLMs (e.g., OpenAI's GPT, Anthropic's Claude) generally outperform their open-source counterparts, the progress on the latter has been rapid with claims of achieving parity or even better on certain tasks. This has crucial implications not only on research but also on business. In this work, on the first anniversary of ChatGPT, we provide an exhaustive overview of this success, surveying all tasks where an open-source LLM has claimed to be on par or better than ChatGPT.

<p><span>We at Duke University Libraries have decided to stop using the project management platform, Basecamp, to which we have subscribed for almost a decade. We came to this decision after weighing the level of its use in our organization, which is considerable, against the harms that we see perpetuated by the leadership of Basecamp’s parent company, 37signals. As a result of our discussions, we will not renew our current subscription when it ends in December. In the meantime, a small group of our staff have committed to help colleagues export their Basecamp content so it can be archived, and we will move to using other productivity platforms.</span></p>
<p><span>In July of this year, in a team chat, one of our colleagues shared a link to a blog post authored by one of the founders and owners of 37signals, and commented, “We really might want to rethink our usage of Basecamp.”</span></p>
<p><span>It jogged our memories of events some 26 months earlier, when another colleague shared an article published on The Verge, </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22406673/basecamp-political-speech-policy-controversy"><span>“Breaking Camp.”</span></a><span> As reported, internal conflict regarding a culturally-insensitive list of “funny” customer names led Basecamp’s leadership to ban employees from holding “societal and political discussions,” ignoring that the conflict focused on workplace dynamics. Mass resignations resulted, and the experiences of the employees interviewed paints a picture of company leaders who initially supported Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) activities but eventually placed severe restrictions on how those activities could play out at work. In a playbook for the ages, those in power failed to acknowledge the complicated interconnectedness and nuance of the issues under discussion, and set policies that shut down discussions challenging the company culture.</span></p>
<p><span>The discussions we had in 2021 identified concerns about both the culture at Basecamp and the impact a decision to leave it would have on our daily work. Staff reflected on the ease of using the platform, the large number of projects that rely on it, and the complication of a decision that would impact groups across in the Libraries in such a direct way. While we talked about how we might respond to the values of third-party companies, we eventually decided not to pursue a cancellation.</span></p>
<p><span>When we revisited the discussion this summer, it took a decidedly different direction. The blog post that our colleague shared in July, titled </span><a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/the-law-of-the-land-c2231109"><span>“The law of the land,”</span></a><span> by 37signals co-founder, co-owner, and CTO, David Heinemeier Hansson, celebrates the US Supreme Court’s ruling ending considerations of race in admission to colleges and universities. In that post, Hansson links to another that drew our attention, </span><a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/the-waning-days-of-dei-s-dominance-9a5b656c"><span>“The waning days of DEI’s dominance.”</span></a><span> We also read a third post of his, </span><a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/meta-goes-no-politics-at-work-and-nobody-cares-d6409209"><span>“Meta goes no politics at work (and nobody cares).”</span></a><span> We found there a thread of ugly thought, couched in an overriding intellectual dishonesty, that re-escalated our discussion about continued use of Basecamp.</span></p>

<p><span>We’re not going to address each of the many falsehoods and distortions in the blog posts by David Heinemeier Hansson. Instead, we will focus on a few emblematic statements that stand in for a pattern of rhetoric that runs counter to our own values.</span></p>
<p><span>In the “waning days” piece, Hansson depicts Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion as a movement that became entrenched in 2020, a process he characterizes being “accelerated” by a number of factors, including “the riots in the wake of George Floyd.” Referring to the protests that followed the murder of George Floyd as “riots” is an offhand gesture as Hansson uses it, but it gets our attention because we know how false, ideological, and ugly it is.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://acleddata.com/2020/09/03/demonstrations-political-violence-in-america-new-data-for-summer-2020/"><span>Research and the documentary record</span></a> <a href="https://wapo.st/3ZcERFW"><span>show</span></a><span> that the protests of 2020 were overwhelmingly peaceful, that incidents of violence were limited and often instigated by counter protestors or provocateurs, and that in many cases the responses of the police and federal authorities provoked and exacerbated the violence. The characterization of these events as “riots” followed as part of a deliberate disinformation campaign by right-wing groups, media’s distorting focus on isolated incidents, and biased framing by political campaigns. It plays on a longstanding and shameful tendency in the US of depicting any protest or demands for justice from Black members of our society as innately violent and threatening.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In the same post, Hansson takes glee in the mass layoffs of tech workers in late 2022. He imagines that they were the group “from whom the DEI movement drew its most active and engaged disciples,” and seems to be delighted that “hundreds of thousands” of tech workers will be out of work – “perhaps for quite a while!” – and therefore “the most fervent ideologues among them” will be unable to find work. The implication is unavoidable, that he and perhaps other tech bosses might blacklist workers who have records of advocating for more diverse and inclusive workplaces.</span></p>
<p><span>Hansson certainly is entitled to his opinion, and to publish his own blog. We are not in the habit of running “ideological enforcement” to ensure “quick compliance” from beleaguered corporate executives or whatever it is that he’s talking about in his posts. We simply have our own opinions and our own blogs, and in some cases, we have good choices available to us regarding the companies to which we give our business.</span></p>
<p><span>After all, we’re the libraries. We have plenty of experience with corporate entities that don’t reflect our values. We deal with the journal publishers who practice a business model that hoards the world’s knowledge and maximizes profit from the research that our university’s scholars conduct. When it comes to the academic publishing system, institutions of higher learning have made a deal with the devil, and we, the libraries, are the campus units who pay the bill. We do it every year, often facing steep price increases with flat budgets.</span></p>
<p><span>We also know all too well the very worst of what humanity can create, because we collect it. Our shelves hold some of the most god-awful, hateful stuff you can imagine, in the form of explicit hate literature; and the much larger bulk of mainstream materials we hold are pervaded by casual racism and assumptions of white supremacy. Our job is to maintain it all for research, and to provide the context required for responsible inquiry. We know that our collections as a whole are themselves the legacies of systems of oppression in what they do and do not contain. The entire foundation of our organization was developed on assumptions, in the early days of Duke University, that excluded groups would not use the materials we collect or the services we provide. We know about these legacies, and we reckon with them by considering the harm they’ve caused, and asking what we can do to mitigate it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We also know the harms that our own workplace practices and culture have caused over the years. We know about it because we listen to each other, both informally and formally, via climate surveys, workshops, and other practices.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The point is not that we’re perfect, or a model to emulate. The point is that we are not naive. We have seen (and done) some stuff.</span></p>
<p><span>So when we encounter a tech company boss who takes in a nationwide movement of organized protest against police brutalization and systemic racism, led by Black activists, and amplifies the rare incidents of violence, much of it instigated by the police or right-wing counter protestors, using the mendacious language of extremists to refer to it as “riots,” we have a good idea what we’re looking at.</span></p>
<p><span>When we enter into business with a company whose boss takes delight in the mass layoffs of tech workers because it disempowers those who might speak out against their company keeping a list of non-Anglophone names that some members of the team find hilarious, we have a decent sense of who we’re dealing with.</span></p>
<p><span>We here in the libraries are world-weary and sophisticated. We recognize that it’s the nature of our world, so interconnected now. We think all that interconnection makes us stronger, more vibrant; it’s wondrous, but it also means that as we encounter difference, we need to “do the work” (as Hansson mocks), be aware, and be open. Not every situation is going to be easy, but bringing “our whole selves” (another phrase that he mocks) to it has an impact, makes it more real, more human.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There are always going to be the free riders – tech companies, perhaps – who benefit from the interconnectedness of the world while refusing to do the work. They may even taunt, from their blogs, those who try. Their paths are going to intersect with ours; that’s just the way it works. Often, we’re not in a position to choose not to deal with them.</span></p>
<p><span>But occasionally, we are. Not because we want to eliminate anyone’s livelihood, or harry executives, or because we imagine our subscription fee makes much of a difference. But just because we can. In this case, there are other productivity tools that can fill the space. In this case, we have options. And we’ve chosen to end our subscription with Basecamp.</span></p>
