<p>There are dozens of animal studies that show unequivocally that ketamine is neurotoxic. There is a common myth that ketamine is “neurogenetic”. This is mostly false. It increases neuroplasticity temporarily (days to weeks), which though is very different from neurogenesis (the birth of new neurons) – discussed in more detail in the next section.</p>



<p>At recreational doses, ketamine is addictive, destroys the bladder, and is toxic to the central nervous system. Microscopic lesions (including but not limited to so-called “Olney’s lesions”) in both grey and white matter are evident already after three months of high-dose ketamine use.</p>



<p>By year three of heavy use, MRI scans of ketamine users often reveal a brain that looks like a mix between multiple sclerosis (white matter lesions) and Alzheimer’s disease (grey matter atrophy).</p>

<p>Ketamine <em>abuse</em> is well known to cause widespread cognitive and neurological impairment. However, the average ketamine “user” consumes 500-1000mg of ketamine per day, which is a lot more than therapeutic use (0.5mg/kg). One glass of wine per week is surely different from a gallon of vodka per day.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, it’s widely recognized that individuals who occasionally use ketamine find they need significantly higher doses than when they first started, even after prolonged periods of abstinence.</p>



<p>For instance, after a few months of using therapeutic doses of ketamine (around 0.5mg/kg per week), I noticed that its impact was much less pronounced compared to my initial experiences with the substance. Even extended breaks did not bring back my virgin response – <a href="https://desmolysium.com/recreational/#mdma" data-type="post" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an analogous way that MDMA users never recapture the magic of their first few trips</a>.</p>



<p>This form of “permatolerance” may point to neurotoxicity – in the same (but mechanistically different) way it does with MDMA.</p>



<p>Researchers are still unsure whether it is safe to use ketamine at low therapeutic doses at reasonable frequencies for a couple of weeks to a couple of months. However, in the case of otherwise untreatable depression, the risks and side effects need to be weighed against the risks and side effects of ongoing depression. Furthermore, depression itself is quite damaging to brain health itself.</p>



<p>I looked into this matter quite extensively myself and I also talked to a handful of university psychiatrists who have been using ketamine on their patients for years – long before Spravato was available. Every single one of them believes that ketamine is quite neurotoxic but in contrast to otherwise untreatable depression the lesser evil.</p>



<p>There is one study that looked at ketamine administration long-term and did not find evidence of neurocognitive decline. However, they were using clinical tests, which are not very sensitive and to reach statistical significance quite a bit of degeneration has had to happen. Furthermore, these were depressive subjects and if you treat depression, neurocognition usually increases. So, if ketamine really treated their depression (which it reportedly did), should there not be an <em>increase </em>in cognition between baseline and timepoint X? Possibly, neurocognitive domains did improve but the gains were erased by gradual neurotoxicity.</p>



<p>I discuss ketamine, and my personal experience with it, in more detail <a data-type="post" data-id="3364" href="https://desmolysium.com/ketamine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>

<h2>But isn’t ketamine neurogenetic?!</h2>



<p>No, it is not. It increases <em>neuroplasticity</em>, which, for practical purposes is limited to the generation of dendritic spines (spinogenesis) and synapses (synaptogenesis). Spinogenesis and synaptogenesis are very different from <em>neurogenesis</em> (the birth of new neurons). Neurogenesis is limited to two sites in the human brain and a local creation of neurons in these sites cannot make up for the death of functionally integrated and possibly extensively connected neurons elsewhere.</p>



<p>Synaptogenesis and spinogenesis are short-lived (weeks) but dead neurons will never undie.</p>



<p>Given that Spravato (esketamine nasal spray) has been widely available and so-called “ketamine-clinics” proliferated, we are possibly going to have an answer to the question regarding whether and the extent of ketamine neurotoxicity soon. In the meantime, it is probably prudent to err on the side of caution.</p>



<p>My gut feeling is that people who are doing ketamine at even therapeutic doses regularly are more likely than not to give themselves non-negligible amounts of irreversible brain damage.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, ketamine has become a frequent drug of abuse at doses far higher than therapeutic doses. Similar to MDMA (although by a completely different mechanism), the neurotoxicity caused by high doses is irreversible. It is also quite worrying to see ketamine clinics mushrooming everywhere, with some patients reportedly going in twice per week and being given infusions of 100mg or more. As so often, hype and industry are about to destroy something that was originally quite useful in select cases.</p>

    <p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> What is the complete path between visiting thepiratebay and sublimating an mp3 file from thin air? In this post, we’ll implement enough of the BitTorrent protocol to download Debian. Look at the <a href="https://github.com/veggiedefender/torrent-client/">Source code</a> or skip to the <a href="https://blog.jse.li/posts/torrent#putting-it-all-together">last bit</a>.
    </p>
    

    <section>
      
<p>This post is also available in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200616163517if_/https://4gophers.ru/articles/bittorrent/#.Xuj0zivLerw">Russian</a>, <a href="https://markruler.github.io/posts/go/building-bittorrent-client/">Korean</a>, and <a href="https://blog.mynameisdhr.com/YongGOCongLingJianLiBitTorrentKeHuDuan/">Chinese</a>.</p>
<p>BitTorrent is a protocol for downloading and distributing files across the Internet. In contrast with the traditional client/server relationship, in which downloaders connect to a central server (for example: watching a movie on Netflix, or loading the web page you’re reading now), participants in the BitTorrent network, called <strong>peers</strong>, download pieces of files from <em>each other</em>—this is what makes it a <strong>peer-to-peer</strong> protocol. We’ll investigate how this works, and build our own client that can find peers and exchange data between them.</p>
<img src="https://blog.jse.li/torrent/client-server-p2p.png" alt="diagram showing the difference between client/server (all clients connecting to one server) and peer-to-peer (peers connecting to each other) relationships">
<p>The protocol evolved organically over the past 20 years, and various people and organizations added extensions for features like encryption, private torrents, and new ways of finding peers. We’ll be implementing the <a href="https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0003.html">original spec</a> from 2001 to keep this a weekend-sized project.</p>
<p>I’ll be using a <a href="https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/bt-cd/#indexlist">Debian ISO</a> file as my guinea pig because it’s big, but not huge, at 350MB. As a popular Linux distribution, there will be lots of fast and cooperative peers for us to connect to. And we’ll avoid the legal and ethical issues related to downloading pirated content.</p>

<h2 id="finding-peers">Finding peers</h2>
<p>Here’s a problem: we want to download a file with BitTorrent, but it’s a peer-to-peer protocol and we have no idea where to find peers to download it from. This is a lot like moving to a new city and trying to make friends—maybe we’ll hit up a local pub or a meetup group! Centralized locations like these are the big idea behind <strong>trackers</strong>, which are central servers that introduce peers to each other. They’re just web servers running over HTTP<span>*<span>Some trackers use a <a href="http://bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0015.html">UDP</a> binary protocol to save bandwidth</span></span>
, and you can find Debian’s at <a href="http://bttracker.debian.org:6969/">http://bttracker.debian.org:6969/</a></p>
<img src="https://blog.jse.li/torrent/trackers.png" alt="illustration of a desktop computer and laptop sitting at a pub">
<p>Of course, these central servers are liable to get raided by the feds if they facilitate peers exchanging illegal content. You may remember reading about trackers like TorrentSpy, Popcorn Time, and KickassTorrents getting seized and shut down. New methods cut out the middleman by making even <strong>peer discovery</strong> a distributed process. We won’t be implementing them, but if you’re interested, some terms you can research are <strong>DHT</strong>, <strong>PEX</strong>, and <strong>magnet links</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="parsing-a-torrent-file">Parsing a .torrent file</h2>
<p>A .torrent file describes the contents of a torrentable file and information for connecting to a tracker. It’s all we need in order to kickstart the process of downloading a torrent. Debian’s .torrent file looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>d8:announce41:http://bttracker.debian.org:6969/announce7:comment35:"Debian CD from cdimage.debian.org"13:creation datei1573903810e9:httpseedsl145:https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/release/10.2.0//srv/cdbuilder.debian.org/dst/deb-cd/weekly-builds/amd64/iso-cd/debian-10.2.0-amd64-netinst.iso145:https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/archive/10.2.0//srv/cdbuilder.debian.org/dst/deb-cd/weekly-builds/amd64/iso-cd/debian-10.2.0-amd64-netinst.isoe4:infod6:lengthi351272960e4:name31:debian-10.2.0-amd64-netinst.iso12:piece lengthi262144e6:pieces26800:�����PS�^�� (binary blob of the hashes of each piece)ee
</code></pre><p>That mess is encoded in a format called <strong>Bencode</strong> (pronounced <em>bee-encode</em>), and we’ll need to decode it.</p>
<p>Bencode can encode roughly the same types of structures as JSON—strings, integers, lists, and dictionaries. Bencoded data is not as human-readable/writable as JSON, but it can efficiently handle binary data and it’s really simple to parse from a stream. Strings come with a length prefix, and look like <code>4:spam</code>. Integers go between <em>start</em> and <em>end</em> markers, so <code>7</code> would encode to <code>i7e</code>. Lists and dictionaries work in a similar way: <code>l4:spami7ee</code> represents <code>['spam', 7]</code>, while <code>d4:spami7ee</code> means <code>{spam: 7}</code>.</p>
<p>In a prettier format, our .torrent file looks like this:</p>
<div>
  <pre><code><span>d</span>
  <span>8</span>:<span>announce</span>
    <span>41</span>:<span>http://bttracker.debian.org:6969/announce</span>

        <span>26800</span>:<span>�����PS�^�� (binary blob of the hashes of each piece)</span></code>
    <span>e</span>
<span>e</span></pre>
</div>
<p>In this file, we can spot the URL of the tracker, the creation date (as a Unix timestamp), the name and size of the file, and a big binary blob containing the SHA-1 hashes of each <strong>piece</strong>, which are equally-sized parts of the file we want to download. The exact size of a piece varies between torrents, but they are usually somewhere between 256KB and 1MB. This means that a large file might be made up of <em>thousands</em> of pieces. We’ll download these pieces from our peers, check them against the hashes from our torrent file, assemble them together, and boom, we’ve got a file!</p>
<img src="https://blog.jse.li/torrent/pieces.png" alt="illustration of a file being cut with scissors into multiple pieces, starting with piece 0">
<p>This mechanism allows us to verify the integrity of each piece as we go. It makes BitTorrent resistant to accidental corruption or intentional <strong>torrent poisoning</strong>. Unless an attacker is capable of breaking SHA-1 with a preimage attack, we will get exactly the content we asked for.</p>
<p>It would be really fun to write a bencode parser, but parsing isn’t our focus today. But I found Fredrik Lundh’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200105114449/https://effbot.org/zone/bencode.htm">50 line parser</a> to be especially illuminating. For this project, I used <a href="https://github.com/jackpal/bencode-go">github.com/jackpal/bencode-go</a>:</p>

<p>Because I like to keep my structures relatively flat, and I like to keep my application structs separate from my serialization structs, I exported a different, flatter struct named <code>TorrentFile</code> and wrote a few helper functions to convert between the two.</p>
<p>Notably, I split <code>pieces</code> (previously a string) into a slice of hashes (each <code>[20]byte</code>) so that I can easily access individual hashes later. I also computed the SHA-1 hash of the entire bencoded <code>info</code> dict (the one which contained the name, size, and piece hashes). We know this as the <strong>infohash</strong> and it uniquely identifies files when we talk to trackers and peers. More on this later.</p>

<p>Now that we have information about the file and its tracker, let’s talk to the tracker to <strong>announce</strong> our presence as a peer and to retrieve a list of other peers.

<p>The important ones:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>info_hash</strong>: Identifies the <em>file</em> we’re trying to download. It’s the infohash we calculated earlier from the bencoded <code>info</code> dict. The tracker will use this to figure out which peers to show us.</li>
<li><strong>peer_id</strong>: A 20 byte name to identify <em>ourselves</em> to trackers and peers. We’ll just generate 20 random bytes for this. Real BitTorrent clients have IDs like <code>-TR2940-k8hj0wgej6ch</code> which identify the client software and version—in this case, TR2940 stands for Transmission client 2.94.</li>
</ul>

    <span>252</span>:<span>(another long binary blob)</span>
<span>e</span></code></pre>
</div>
<p><code>Interval</code> tells us how often we’re supposed to connect to the tracker again to refresh our list of peers. A value of 900 means we should reconnect every 15 minutes (900 seconds).</p>
<p><code>Peers</code> is another long binary blob containing the IP addresses of each peer. It’s made out of <strong>groups of six bytes</strong>. The first four bytes in each group represent the peer’s IP address—each byte represents a number in the IP. The last two bytes represent the port, as a big-endian <code>uint16</code>. <strong>Big-endian</strong>, or <strong>network order</strong>, means that we can interpret a group of bytes as an integer by just squishing them together left to right. For example, the bytes <code>0x1A</code>, <code>0xE1</code> make <code>0x1AE1</code>, or 6881 in decimal.<span>*<span>Interpreting the same bytes in <strong>little-endian</strong> order would make 0xE11A = 57626</span></span></p>

<h2 id="downloading-from-peers">Downloading from peers</h2>
<p>Now that we have a list of peers, it’s time to connect with them and start downloading pieces! We can break down the process into a few steps. For each peer, we want to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start a TCP connection with the peer. This is like starting a phone call.</li>
<li>Complete a two-way BitTorrent <strong>handshake</strong>. <em>“Hello?” “Hello."</em></li>
<li>Exchange <strong>messages</strong> to download <strong>pieces</strong>. <em>“I’d like piece #231 please."</em></li>

</div>
<p>I set a timeout so that I don’t waste too much time on peers that aren’t going to let me connect. For the most part, it’s a pretty standard TCP connection.</p>
<h2 id="complete-the-handshake">Complete the handshake</h2>
<p>We’ve just set up a connection with a peer, but we want do a handshake to validate our assumptions that the peer</p>
<ul>
<li>can communicate using the BitTorrent protocol</li>
<li>is able to understand and respond to our messages</li>
<li>has the file that we want, or at least knows what we’re talking about</li>
</ul>
<img src="https://blog.jse.li/torrent/handshake.png" alt="Two computers communicating. One asks 'do you speak BitTorrent and have this file?' and the other replies 'I speak BitTorrent and have that file'">
<p>My father told me that the secret to a good handshake is a firm grip and eye contact. The secret to a good BitTorrent handshake is that it’s made up of five parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>The length of the protocol identifier, which is always 19 (0x13 in hex)</li>
<li>The protocol identifier, called the <strong>pstr</strong> which is always <code>BitTorrent protocol</code></li>
<li>Eight <strong>reserved bytes</strong>, all set to 0. We’d flip some of them to 1 to indicate that we support certain <a href="http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0010.html">extensions</a>. But we don’t, so we’ll keep them at 0.</li>
<li>The <strong>infohash</strong> that we calculated earlier to identify which file we want</li>
<li>The <strong>Peer ID</strong> that we made up to identify ourselves</li>
</ol>
<p>Put together, a handshake string might look like this:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>\x13</span><span>BitTorrent protocol</span><span>\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00</span><span>\x86\xd4\xc8\x00\x24\xa4\x69\xbe\x4c\x50\xbc\x5a\x10\x2c\xf7\x17\x80\x31\x00\x74</span><span>-TR2940-k8hj0wgej6ch</span></code></pre></div>
<p>After we send a handshake to our peer, we should receive a handshake back in the same format. The infohash we get back should match the one we sent so that we know that we’re talking about the same file. If everything goes as planned, we’re good to go. If not, we can sever the connection because there’s something wrong. <em>“Hello?” “这是谁？ 你想要什么？” “Okay, wow, wrong number."</em></p>
<p>In our code, let’s make a struct to represent a handshake, and write a few methods for serializing and reading them:</p>

<h2 id="send-and-receive-messages">Send and receive messages</h2>
<p>Once we’ve completed the initial handshake, we can send and receive <strong>messages</strong>. Well, not quite—if the other peer isn’t ready to accept messages, we can’t send any until they tell us they’re ready. In this state, we’re considered <strong>choked</strong> by the other peer. They’ll send us an <strong>unchoke</strong> message to let us know that we can begin asking them for data. By default, we assume that we’re choked until proven otherwise.</p>
<p>Once we’ve been unchoked, we can then begin sending <strong>requests</strong> for pieces, and they can send us messages back containing pieces.</p>
<img src="https://blog.jse.li/torrent/choke.png" alt="A cartoon in which person 1 says 'hello I would like piece number—' and person 2 grabs him by the neck and says '00 00 00 01 00 (choke)'">
<h3 id="interpreting-messages">Interpreting messages</h3>
<p>A message has a length, an <strong>ID</strong> and a <strong>payload</strong>. On the wire, it looks like:</p>
<img src="https://blog.jse.li/torrent/message.png" alt="A message with 4 byte for the length, 1 byte for ID, and an optional payload">
<p>A message starts with a length indicator which tells us how many bytes long the message will be. It’s a 32-bit integer, meaning it’s made out of four bytes smooshed together in big-endian order. The next byte, the <strong>ID</strong>, tells us which type of message we’re receiving—for example, a <code>2</code> byte means “interested.” Finally, the optional <strong>payload</strong> fills out the remaining length of the message.</p>

<h3 id="bitfields">Bitfields</h3>
<p>One of the most interesting types of message is the <strong>bitfield</strong>, which is a data structure that peers use to efficiently encode which pieces they are able to send us. A bitfield looks like a byte array, and to check which pieces they have, we just need to look at the positions of the <em>bits</em> set to 1. You can think of it like the digital equivalent of a coffee shop loyalty card. We start with a blank card of all <code>0</code>, and flip bits to <code>1</code> to mark their positions as “stamped.”</p>

<p>By working with <em>bits</em> instead of <em>bytes</em>, this data structure is super compact. We can stuff information about eight pieces in the space of a single byte—the size of a <code>bool</code>. The tradeoff is that accessing values becomes a little more tricky. The smallest unit of memory that computers can address are bytes, so to get to our bits, we have to do some bitwise manipulation:</p>

<p>We now have all the tools we need to download a torrent: we have a list of peers obtained from the tracker, and we can communicate with them by dialing a TCP connection, initiating a handshake, and sending and receiving messages. Our last big problems are handling the <strong>concurrency</strong> involved in talking to multiple peers at once, and managing the <strong>state</strong> of our peers as we interact with them. These are both classically Hard problems.</p>
<h3 id="managing-concurrency-channels-as-queues">Managing concurrency: channels as queues</h3>
<p>In Go, we <a href="https://blog.golang.org/share-memory-by-communicating">share memory by communicating</a>, and we can think of a Go channel as a cheap thread-safe queue.</p>
<p>We’ll set up two channels to synchronize our concurrent workers: one for dishing out work (pieces to download) between peers, and another for collecting downloaded pieces. As downloaded pieces come in through the results channel, we can copy them into a buffer to start assembling our complete file.</p>

<p>We’ll spawn a worker goroutine for each peer we’ve received from the tracker. It’ll connect and handshake with the peer, and then start retrieving work from the <code>workQueue</code>, attempting to download it, and sending downloaded pieces back through the <code>results</code> channel.</p>

<p>We’ll keep track of each peer in a struct, and modify that struct as we read messages. It’ll include data like how much we’ve downloaded from the peer, how much we’ve requested from them, and whether we’re choked. If we wanted to scale this further, we could formalize this as a finite state machine. But a struct and a switch are good enough for now.</p>

<h3 id="time-to-make-requests">Time to make requests!</h3>
<p>Files, pieces, and piece hashes aren’t the full story—we can go further by breaking down pieces into <strong>blocks</strong>. A block is a part of a piece, and we can fully define a block by the <strong>index</strong> of the piece it’s part of, its byte <strong>offset</strong> within the piece, and its <strong>length</strong>. When we make requests for data from peers, we are actually requesting <em>blocks</em>. A block is usually 16KB large, meaning that a single 256 KB piece might actually require 16 requests.</p>
<p>A peer is supposed to sever the connection if they receive a request for a block larger than 16KB. However, based on my experience, they’re often perfectly happy to satisfy requests up to 128KB. I only got moderate gains in overall speed with larger block sizes, so it’s probably better to stick with the spec.</p>
<h3 id="pipelining">Pipelining</h3>
<p>Network round-trips are expensive, and requesting each block one by one will absolutely tank the performance of our download. Therefore, it’s important to <strong>pipeline</strong> our requests such that we keep up a constant pressure of some number of unfulfilled requests. This can increase the throughput of our connection by an order of magnitude.</p>
<img src="https://blog.jse.li/torrent/pipelining.png" alt="Two email threads simulating peer connections. The thread on the left shows a request followed by a reply, repeated three times. The thread on the left sends three requests, and receives three replies in quick succession.">
<p>Classically, BitTorrent clients kept a queue of five pipelined requests, and that’s the value I’ll be using. I found that increasing it can up to double the speed of a download. Newer clients use an <a href="https://luminarys.com/posts/writing-a-bittorrent-client.html">adaptive</a> queue size to better accommodate modern network speeds and conditions. This is definitely a parameter worth tweaking, and it’s pretty low hanging fruit for future performance optimization.</p>

Together, the two platforms had more than 400,000 unique monthly users in Spain.</p><p>Cloudflare called the effort misguided and said LaLiga had left it with no other option than to pursue the legal action. “LaLiga secured this blocking order without notifying cloud providers, while concealing from the court the predictable harm to third parties and the public good. LaLiga’s actions pose a clear threat to the open Internet. Cloudflare has now filed a legal action to challenge the order and establish that LaLiga’s disproportionate blocking efforts are unlawful.&nbsp;</p><p>“Instead of addressing Spanish users’ concerns about excessive content blocking, LaLiga has attempted to deflect with baseless claims against Cloudflare while doubling down on its unlawful blocking practices.&nbsp;Cloudflare hopes this legal action helps prevent future indiscriminate blocking measures, and makes it clear that rightsholders cannot prioritise&nbsp;their commercial interests over the fundamental right of millions of consumers to access the open Internet.”</p><p>Like the majority of cloud providers, Cloudflare uses shared IP addresses to manage its network, meaning that thousands of domains can be accessed with a single IP address.</p><p>LaLiga claims more than 50% of pirate IPs illegally distributing its content are protected by Cloudflare.&nbsp;</p></div></article></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="incArticle"><p>OpenAI researchers have admitted that even the most advanced AI models&nbsp;still are no match for human coders — even though CEO Sam Altman insists they will be able to beat "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1iinrrq/sam_altman_software_engineering_will_be_very/">low-level</a>" software engineers by the end of this year.</p><p>In a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.12115">new paper</a>, the company's researchers found that even frontier models, or the most advanced and boundary-pushing AI systems, "are still unable to solve the majority" of coding tasks.</p><p>The researchers used&nbsp;a newly-developed benchmark called SWE-Lancer, built on more than 1,400 software engineering tasks from the freelancer site Upwork. Using the benchmark, OpenAI put three large language models (LLMs) — its own o1 reasoning model and flagship GPT-4o, as well as Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet — to the test.</p><p>Specifically, the new benchmark evaluated how well the LLMs performed with two types of tasks from Upwork: individual tasks, which involved resolving bugs and implementing fixes to them, or management tasks that saw the models trying to zoom out and make higher-level decisions. (The models weren't allowed to access the internet, meaning they couldn't just crib similar answers that'd been posted online.)</p><p>The models took on tasks cumulatively worth hundreds of thousands of dollars on Upwork,&nbsp;but they were only able to fix surface-level software issues, while remaining unable to actually find bugs in larger projects or find their root causes. These shoddy and half-baked "solutions" are likely familiar&nbsp;to anyone who's worked with AI — which is great at spitting out confident-sounding information that <a href="https://futurism.com/cnet-ai-errors">often falls apart</a> on closer inspection.</p><p>Though all three LLMs were often able to operate "far faster than a human would," the paper notes, they also failed to grasp how widespread bugs&nbsp;were or to understand their context, "leading to solutions that are incorrect or insufficiently comprehensive."</p><p>As the researchers explained, Claude 3.5 Sonnet performed better than the two OpenAI models pitted against it and made more money than o1 and GPT-4o. Still, the majority of its answers were wrong, and&nbsp;according to the researchers,&nbsp;any model would need "higher reliability" to be trusted with real-life coding tasks.</p><p>Put more plainly, the paper seems to demonstrate that although these frontier models can work quickly and solve zoomed-in tasks, they're are nowhere near as skilled at handling them as human engineers.</p><p>Though these LLMs have advanced rapidly over the past few years and will likely continue to do so, they're not skilled enough at software engineering to replace real-life people quite yet — not that that's stopping CEOs from <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/stack-overflow-layoffs-ai">firing their human coders</a> in favor of <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/ai-programming-assistants-code-error">immature AI models</a>.</p><p><strong>More on AI and coding: </strong><a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/zuckerberg-automate-coding-ai"><em>Zuckerberg Announces Plans to Automate Facebook Coding Jobs With AI</em></a></p><br></section></div>]]></description>

I've also spent some time reading through the archives here, and come to the
conclusion that the best posts I've made -- at least from my perspective --
follow a similar pattern.  They're posts where I've been learning how to do something,
or how something worked, and presented what I've found as a summary, often
as a tutorial.</p>

<p>I think of these as <em>writing the post that I wished I'd found</em> when I started
learning whatever it was.</p>


    
        <p>I think these posts serve two purposes.</p>

<p>Firstly, for me, they're an excellent way to codify and solidify the knowledge.
Finding out how to do something new, and ideally doing it, is important to grow
as an engineer, but writing down what you learned makes it sink into your mind at
a gut level.  I'm a big believer that you don't really understand something
properly if you can't explain it to an intelligent and interested listener.
I still remember how the <code>epoll</code> system call works, and the
difference between edge-triggered and level-triggered events, despite it
being almost twelve years since <a href="https://www.gilesthomas.com/2013/08/writing-a-reverse-proxyloadbalancer-from-the-ground-up-in-c-part-0">I wrote about it</a>.</p>

<p>But it seems that they might also be the most useful ones for other people.  From
Google Search Console, I can see that the majority of visits to this blog
from people who aren't regular readers comes from searches for things
that I've written about in these posts.  Comparing their search terms to what I
wrote about in the posts in question, there seems to be a good match -- so hopefully
they're finding what they are looking for.</p>

<p>I've decided to make a concerted effort to post more of this kind of thing.  I
struggled a bit to think of a snappy category name for them, as "tutorials that I
wished someone else had written for me before I started trying to learn this stuff"
is a bit wordy.  I've tentatively settled on "<a href="https://www.gilesthomas.com/til-deep-dives">TIL deep dives</a>" --
they're not the quick "Today I learned" posts that I've seen on other people's
blogs (Simon Willison is the master of this and even has <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/">a subdomain devoted to his</a>)
-- but they're a similar kind of beast, a longer form of the same kind of thing.</p>

<p>Thoughts, as always, welcome in the comments below.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This week, the UK put the entire world at risk. I understand that may sound like alarmist hyperbole, but follow me. To understand, we have to go back to 2016, a year that I like to describe as “the year the world got collectively blackout drunk and decided to call our ex.” A lot of wild stuff happened that year – especially in the UK – so one thing that might’ve slipped under the radar was the passing of a little law called the Investigatory Powers Act. This law would later go on to be nicknamed “The Snooper’s Charter” by critics, and it allowed the UK to dramatically expand their electronic surveillance powers. How dramatically, you might ask? Two weeks ago, Apple was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/02/07/apple-encryption-backdoor-uk/">ordered</a> to insert an encryption backdoor (more on that in a moment) into iCloud. And they weren’t allowed to publicly disclose it. And also even if they wanted to fight it, they’d still have to comply while the courts considered their appeal.</p>

<p>Yeah. That dramatically.</p>

<p>The thing is, Apple has made it abundantly clear in no uncertain terms that they will <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/government-information-requests/">refuse any request</a> by any government to knowingly insert backdoors into their software. So in light of their inability to fight this request, Apple simply decided to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/apple-pulls-data-protection-tool-instead-of-caving-to-uk-demand-for-a-backdoor/">remove</a> iCloud encryption entirely for UK users.</p>

<h2 id="advanced-data-protection">Advanced Data Protection</h2>

<p>Some readers may be a little confused on how all this works (also my wording wasn't 100% accurate for the sake of brevity), so let me break it down real quick. <a href="https://thenewoil.org/en/guides/prologue/encryption/">Encryption</a> is the practice of taking data and making it unreadable to unauthorized parties, much like a secret code or language. Most modern devices and internet traffic is encrypted, but in such a way that the service provider still has access. Your Gmail inbox, for example, is encrypted as it travels between your phone and Google’s servers but it’s decrypted at those two spots, meaning anyone at Google who has the proper access can access your emails. (There's a lot of valid reasons for this, but it also opens up your data to being spied on, sold, or otherwise shared and potentially abused.) Some providers, however, take it a step further and implement what's called “end-to-end encryption,” (aka “E2EE” or “zero-knowledge encryption”). This is data encrypted in such a way where it’s only ever accessible on your devices, never the provider’s. (More on all of this in the page I linked earlier in this paragraph.) While there are no doubt a handful of evil people who would abuse E2EE to better cover their harmful tracks, it also benefits ordinary, law-abiding users by giving them a huge defensive boost against data breaches, massive data collection, unchecked mass surveillance, and a myriad of other threats online.</p>

<p>This brings us to Apple’s “Advanced Data Protection” program. Released in 2022, ADP was a huge upgrade to Apple’s iCloud suite, encrypting nearly everything stored in iCloud (except emails, contacts, and calendars) using E2EE. This feature required users to manually enable it, and while I always encourage readers to explore other options by privacy-first companies, I (among many other privacy enthusiasts) still touted this as a win for giving the everyday user an easy, effective way to protect their data. <em>This</em> is the encryption that Apple removed in the UK. Certain Apple products – like iMessage, Health, Passwords, and other data – remain end-to-end encrypted as it always has been, but ADP is specifically what the UK ordered a backdoor into, and thus ADP is what was pulled.</p>

<h2 id="backdoors-salt-typhoon">Backdoors &amp; Salt Typhoon</h2>

<p>Now, quickly, let me explain what an “encryption backdoor” is since I’ve already used it several times and it’s critical to this discussion. A “backdoor” is a term used to describe any sort of loophole in the encryption (or program) that allows someone – usually the developer – to gain direct access to the program or data. Usually this is done quietly, in the background, without the consent or awareness of the end user. (This should not be confused with things like analytics, telemetry, or granting access to tech support voluntarily.)</p>

<p>For years, politicians (and others) have called for backdoors in various software – usually encrypted messengers and the like – with the promise that it will only ever be used by the “good guys.” The problem is that backdoors are very aptly named: a backdoor of a house can be a great tool, allowing residents to come and go into their back yard conveniently and freely. For example, many households will leave the backdoor unlocked as a failsafe for residents to get in or out while reducing their risk – the backdoor is behind the house, maybe behind a fence, hidden out of sight where it may be less tempting to would-be crooks than leaving the front door unlocked.</p>

<p>At least, that’s the theory, right? But we all know that it’s a feel-good gesture at best. Bad guys have no way of knowing that the front door is unlocked, and if the backdoor is unlocked all it takes is one brave criminal who’s scouting the house to hop the fence and try the door. Furthermore, even if it is locked, I’ve personally noted in the past that residential locks are criminally (no pun intended) <a href="https://youtu.be/T_sy3dLwHkc">easy</a> to pick, often taking just a few seconds to someone with even the slightest amount of practice.</p>

<p>There's a reason the term was applied to encryption. Technology is difficult for most people to understand. For those without training in code or electronic engineering, computers seem akin to magic boxes powered by fairy dust and electricity. Even for those trying to learn, it can be difficult to find a good entry point. As such, it’s easy – and tempting – to hear someone promise “a backdoor that only good guys can use” and go “I don’t understand the details but surely it must be true.” After all, deepfakes, cyberespionage, and quantum computers are real things. Surely the magic box full of YouTube and cats makes anything possible, right?</p>

<p>Except – as the tech savvy in the crowd know – no, that’s not at all how it works. A software backdoor is exactly like a physical one: it only keeps out people acting in good faith. Those determined to get in will find their way, whether that’s a vulnerability in the software/encryption itself, or by <a href="https://thenewoil.org/en/guides/less-important/habits/#phishing--clicking-links">phishing</a> a legitimate user and stealing their login credentials or any other number of ways. And that’s to say nothing about the idea of “good guys;” who are they, exactly? Insider threats are a real thing. An abusive homeowner has “legitimate” access to the house’s backdoor, just as a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20893462/yahoo-engineer-hacking-accounts-stolen-nude-photos-videos-guilty-plea">rogue employee</a> would have access to the same backdoor in your encryption. People are people. Some of them are traitors, or make mistakes, or give in to temptation.</p>

<p>In fact, we have real-world proof that backdoors are indiscriminate: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_telecommunications_hack">Salt Typhoon</a>. In late 2024, it came to light that the Chinese government had hacked into at least 9 American telecoms providers (as well as dozens of other countries) using – among other techniques – a backdoor specifically designed to be used by law enforcement for court-approved wiretapping. I <em>cannot</em> impress upon you, dear reader, how big of a deal this is. Every major American cell provider – Verizon, T-Mobile, AT&amp;T, and others – had their backdoor abused by the “bad guys” which gave them access to call logs, messages, and tons of other sensitive data for people up to and including President Donald Trump, Vice President Kamala Harris, and more – using the <strong>exact same tool</strong> designed for the “good guys.” This is absolute, unarguable proof that “a backdoor only the good guys can use” is a fantasy. Politicians who promise this may as well promise unicorns and orcs while they’re at it.</p>

<h2 id="the-broader-pattern">The Broader Pattern</h2>

<p>At this point, you may be convinced that backdoors are bad and the UK was wrong for ordering Apple to implement one. But you may wonder how this threatens users worldwide as I claimed at the start of this article. After all, ADP was only removed from the UK. The answer lies in the larger context: this is a pattern.</p>

<p>I promise I’ll keep this brief, but allow me to give you a quick bit of important internet history: if you’re reading this article, there’s a possibility you've at least heard of services like ProtonMail or Tuta. These are encrypted email providers, and their services are basically built on top of an encryption scheme called “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy">PGP</a>,” which premiered in 1991. Almost immediately, the government tried to stifle PGP, claiming that it should be classified as a weapon and therefore subject to the same regulations as weapons exports in terms of how it was distributed to foreign users. The case was taken to court, where the Supreme Court ultimately ruled that code was free speech, that subjecting code to the same regulations as weapons exports was insane, and that intentionally weakening code to try to one-up our enemies was pointless (and also insane). Thanks to this ruling, we now have a much safer digital with the proliferation of encryption technologies like TLS and AES, allowing for safe online shopping, encrypted storage, and much more. This case became one of the most prominent episodes of what was later dubbed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto_Wars#PC_era">The Crypto Wars</a>. (Fun fact: this case was also what put the <a href="https://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> on the map, and their current Executive Director, Cindy Cohn, was the lead attorney in the case.)</p>

<p>The thing is, the Crypto Wars never really ended. It just comes and goes in phases. For example, during the first Trump administration, US Attorney General <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/08/post-snowden-tech-became-more-secure-but-is-govt-really-at-risk-of-going-dark/">William Barr</a> very outspokenly supported encryption backdoors. But don’t worry, that’s not a partisan take, because the Biden administration also indirectly supported backdoors via the 2022 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kids_Online_Safety_Act">Kids Online Safety Act</a>, which likely would’ve encouraged platforms to weaken, backdoor, or disable encryption to comply. (No word on how Biden would’ve responded to even more hostile bills like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EARN_IT_Act">EARN IT Act</a> or the <a href="https://cdt.org/insights/the-stop-csam-act-threatens-free-expression-and-privacy-rights-of-children-and-adults/">STOP CSAM Act</a>.)</p>

<p>But lest you think this is a US trend, rest assured that it’s not. The most infamous assault on your digital safety in Europe comes in the form of <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/posts/chat-control/">Chat Control</a>, a proposal to force messengers like WhatsApp to scan all your messages for CSAM (Child Sexual Abuse Material). If that sounds familiar, that’s because Apple voluntarily proposed a similar system a few years ago, intending to scan photos on-device before being uploaded to iCloud to look for any illicit content. They ultimately decided <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-icloud-photo-scan-csam-pause-backlash/">against</a> the plan after public backlash, including several proofs-of-concept showing that the system was faulty and an admission that this, too, was a slippery slope ripe for abuse. They ultimately decided there was no way to implement this program in a way that was both effective and reasonably abuse-proof, so they decided to drop it altogether. (Chat Control – and other abominations like the EARN IT Act – still rear their hideous heads from time to time. Apparently the memo is lost in transit somewhere.)</p>

<p>The UK is now spearheading the smear campaign against privacy with things like their <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/01/20/no_place_hide_campaign_anti_e2ee_ukgov/"></a><a href="https://blog.thenewoil.org/tag:NoPlaceToHide"><span>#</span><span>NoPlaceToHide</span></a> campaign, which aimed to paint anyone using encryption as a pedophile. (No, that’s not an exaggeration, actually.) There are still numerous bullish threats to privacy across the western world including calls to erase online anonymity to fight hate speech, vast social media surveillance programs, and more. The UK’s latest demand of Apple is not just an attack on their own citizens. It’s another step forward in a global assault against privacy, online safety, and self-sovereignty for individuals. Placed in the larger context of these ongoing proposals, regulations, and attempts to shift public narrative, this is another blow to privacy – and at least for now, an effective one.</p>

<h2 id="fighting-back">Fighting Back</h2>

<p>In light of the overwhelming evidence against backdoors – things like Salt Typhoon and <a href="https://thenewoil.org/en/guides/prologue/why/#why-care-about-security">rampant data breaches</a> – the only conclusion I can come to is that those who push for backdoors are either ignorant (uneducated on how technology works and thus misled to believe that such a thing is possible) or malicious (knowing full-well it’s not possible but prioritizing their own goals – be it national security or control – over the safety of the individuals under them). But for the UK and those who view encryption as a threat to their ends, it doesn’t matter. The end result is the same: UK user data is now accessible. This is a huge encouragement to other regimes seeking to undermine user safety in the name of whatever packaging they’ve picked this week: child safety, national security, etc.</p>

<p>There are some who speculate that Apple’s withdrawal was strategic: now they can fight the order without needing to comply while it works its way through the courts. I don’t know if that’s true (I haven’t seen any credible sources confirming it) but I would like to believe it is, not because I’m an Apple fan (I discourage my users from using Apple services even if they do decide to use an iPhone) but because I think Apple fighting back and winning would regain lost ground for the right to privacy, much as the ruling for Phil Zimmermann and PGP was ultimately a foundational win that future internet safety would go on to be built on top of. It would set a legal precedent saying “no, you can’t order backdoors (or at least you can’t do them in secret and force compliance in the meantime).” Either of those rulings would be a step forward for the safety of everyday, ordinary digital citizens everywhere. When one country – especially a global superpower – does something, it emboldens others to try following suit. Usually for the worse.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I would like to leave readers with some actionable takeaways. Even if Apple fights this case, it will take years to play out, and we have no guarantee of how it will go.</p>

<p>First things first: those who use iCloud should stop doing so. While ADP remains available in other countries, personally I’ve never been a fan of trusting all your data to a single, proprietary company. While iCloud is very convenient, I’m not entirely convinced it’s worth it. Many of Apple’s services can be safely and easily replicated in other trustworthy services, like photos, calendar, notes, and even drive storage. These are companies who put privacy and security first – not bolting it on as an afterthought the way companies like Apple have done. They're also transparent and rarely have to appease investors, meaning they are incentivized to protect you – the user – instead of selling your data to maximize shareholder profits. The New Oil offers a list of such services <a href="https://thenewoil.org/en/guides/most-important/mobile-apps/">here</a>.</p>

<p>For those things that can’t be easily replicated – like health data, reminders, and digital wallets – I would encourage users to consider what you can store on-device – or better yet, live without. While I will be the first to admit the convenience of things like Apple Wallet or enjoying the insight into the quality of my sleep, I can also confidently say that the trade off is very minimal. Studies have shown cash to be more effective in helping you stay on budget, and for most people basic sleep hygiene (like getting off screens 30 mins before bed, keeping the bedroom dark, and being consistent with your routines) will be plenty.</p>

<p>Finally, I believe that it’s always worth getting involved politically. While we can’t always rely on politicians and laws to protect us, I strongly believe that good privacy laws can act as a layer of defense (just compare the problem of “<a href="https://thenewoil.org/en/guides/moderately-important/people-search/">people search websites</a>” between America and the EU, where GDPR makes them virtually nonexistent). If you’re a UK citizen, you should absolutely find the contact information for your representatives and (politely) express your displeasure at this request and demand they drop the request and start protecting users online instead. (For those who need help making sure they’re communicating effectively, you’ll want to inform them you disprove of the UK’s “technical capability notice” issued to Apple regarding their Advanced Data Protection offering in January of this year.) If you're unsure where to even start with political action, check out the “<a href="https://thenewoil.org/en/links/#get-involved">Get Involved</a>” section of my website. Some of the organizations listed – like Big Brother Watch and Privacy International – are UK based.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Nobody in the privacy community defends crime, especially serious crimes that harm others. But we must always balance our desire to stop the <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2015/oct/06/dan-patrick/dan-patrick-says-all-crime-estimate-committed-15-p/">tiny percentage</a> of criminals against our right to freedom as citizens (I have written about this many times before, probably most notable <a href="https://blog.thenewoil.org/an-open-letter-to-congresspeople-regarding-s#we-don-t-ban-freedom-because-some-people-abuse-it">here</a>). Many of those who support privacy-hostile proposals do so in the name of protecting the children. I don’t have kids of my own, but I do have nieces and nephews that I adore and would do anything for. I can’t help but wonder what sort of world we’re leaving them where they have no freedom to explore and grow, where they’re forever haunted by their mistakes in a digital permanent record, where the only thing standing between their freedom of expression and a fear of self-exploration is policy and not real, technical safeguards that make such abuse impossible. Protecting people is admirable, and we should take all reasonable measures we can to do so. Banning encryption is neither reasonable nor protecting people. It’s actively putting them at risk. Force the UK to respect your privacy and safety by switching to services outside their reach, and let them know that you – a voter – do not support this authoritarian red herring.</p>

We have long considered showing the existence of a linear
time algorithm for a problem to be the gold standard
of achievement.  Indeed, it is hard to imagine doing much
better than that, since for any nontrivial problem, it would seem
that an algorithm must consider all of the input in order to make
a decision.  However, as extremely large data sets grow
more prevalent in a wide variety of settings, it is natural
to wonder what one can do in <i> sublinear </i>  time.   In fact,
there has been a lot of recent interest in this direction.
<p>

Sublinear time is a daunting goal since it allows one to read only
a miniscule fraction of the input.   There are problems for
which deterministic exact sublinear time
algorithms are known.  However, for most natural problems the
algorithm must use randomization and must give an answer which is in
some sense approximate.
There is a growing body of work aimed at finding sublinear
time algorithms for various problems.
Recent results have shown that there are classical
optimization problems whose values can be approximated in
sublinear time.  In addition, <i> property testing </i>, an alternative
notion of approximation for decision problems, has been
applied to give sublinear algorithms for a wide variety of
problems.
One can also
test various properties of distributions, where access to the distribution
is given through samples generated according to the distribution, in
time sublinear in the size of the support of the distribution.

</p><p>
Many examples of problems that can be solved in sublinear time
have been found.   Several useful
techniques, including the use of the Szemeredi Regularity lemma
and low rank approximations of matrices, have emerged for
designing sublinear algorithms.
Still, the study of sublinear time algorithms is
very new, and much remains to be understood about their scope,
both in finding sublinear time algorithms for new problems
and in finding more efficient algorithms for problems that
already have sublinear time algorithms.

</p><p>

The following contains some pointers to a few surveys on sublinear algorithms
and property testing, as well as slides from a short introductory talk.
Some of these pointers are a bit older.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>I’m setting up an old Dell box (2011-era tech). I was migrating to some new boot
drives and setting up grub on them again. Got to the point of deleting the old
boot entries and adding new ones, and got an error like <code>Could not prepare boot
variable: No space left on device</code>. Weird, because there weren’t that many EFI
variables, but <code>df -h</code> also reported that efivars was full:</p><div><pre><code>efivarfs              64K   60K   0K  100% /sys/firmware/efi/efivars
</code></pre></div><p>funky.</p><p>It wasn’t due to a glut of boot entries either; I’m pretty keen on keeping the
old ones cleared out, so we only had a few on here.</p><p>Well, I thought maybe there was a lot of dead space in the nvram that wasn’t in
use but also couldn’t be allocated. So I booted an <a href="https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/any/edk2-shell/">EFI
shell</a>, and did this:</p><div><pre><code>fs0:
dmpstore -s efi-vars
dmpstore -d
dmpstore -l efi-vars
</code></pre></div><p>Please be careful with these commands, it worked for me but for all I know it
might brick your setup. Check <code>help dmpstore</code> first.</p><div><pre><code>efivarfs              64K   14K   46K  24% /sys/firmware/efi/efivars
</code></pre></div><p>And all my UEFI configuration seems to be right as I left it before doing this.
So I think this confirms my suspicions.</p></div>]]></description>

<p>2025-02-21</p>

<p><img src="https://beej.us/blog/data/mastodon-comments/images/mastodon_logo_purple.svg" alt="Websockets Logo"> Comments powered by Mastodon!</p>
<p>I hate ads. I also hate tracking and bloat. But I didn't actually hate
the latter quite enough to get rid of <a href="https://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> for
comments. It was a free, good service, and you could turn off ads for
the users (which I did).</p>
<p>But recently they sent out a mail saying they were not longer offering a
free ad-free option, and it's not worth paying for at my usage levels,
so they got the boot.</p>
<p>What to replace them with? The ultimate would be some kind of home-grown
thing, which I <em>could</em> do with the hosting I have. But it's more than I
want to take on right now.</p>
<p>So that leaves "Comments in Mastodon" as the winner. There's significant
overlap between Mastodon users and my meager collection of blog readers,
so that's not too bad.</p>
<p>The only thing that remains is either grabbing someone else's code to do
the work, or doing it myself. Doing it myself is more fun. Let's figure
it out!</p>
<p>I assumed correctly there was probably an API that would return JSON
data for public comments, and it seems like it should do so without any
login credentials.</p>
<p>First, get the JSON, then parse it down and convert it to HTML,
then embed that in the page. And style it all with CSS.</p>
<p>Oh, and make it work with my custom static site generator.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img src="https://beej.us/blog/common/images/goat50.png" alt="Hint Goat">
Yes, this is going to be JavaScript-powered. I respect that some
people don't support JS, but since Mastodon requires it, we're going
to go with it. Also, it saves me from having a server-side component.</p>
<p>The only assurance I can give is that I don't use JS for tracking or
ads. So you should go ahead and whitelist my site. 😁</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The basic idea is that we're going to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write a blog entry.</li>
<li>Post a link to that blog from our Mastodon account.</li>
<li>Link the blog entry back to our Mastodon post.</li>
<li>In the blog entry, show all the replies that have been made to that
Mastodon post.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Audience</h2>
<p>This assumes you know some basic JavaScript/HTML/CSS, e.g. finding DOM
elements, setting <code>innerHTML</code>, styling with CSS, using <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags,
etc.</p>
<p>I'm going "high-level overview" here, not "complete source code".</p>
<h2>Getting the Post ID</h2>
<p>When you make the announcement post to Mastodon, you need the ID of that
post so you can refer to it from your blog page.</p>
<p>The easiest way to get this is to go to your post on Mastodon, and look
at the URL.</p>
<pre><code>https://mastodon.sdf.org/@beejjorgensen/114011021587416866
</code></pre>
<p>That number at the end is your post ID. We'll need it for later.</p>
<h2>My Site Generator</h2>
<p>I could go off on a tangent here talking about how I think everyone
should write their own static site builder. Preferably in some
POSIX-compliant shell like Bash or Zsh. Because it's super portable,
fast as hell, already installed, and maximally removes dependencies.</p>
<p>But instead, I'll just cover the basics. This site is written in
Markdown (I'm writing Markdown right now in this very sentence). And the
site builder converts that to HTML, sticks some common headers and
footers on there, and then, importantly, substitutes some text in the
result with other values.</p>
<p>But that last bit is how we're going to make a static page aware of the
Mastodon post ID we're going to be peeling comments off of.</p>
<p>For example, the post with the comments might have ID
<code>114011021587416866</code>. Somehow I need to embed that inside the HTML for
the page to be able to <code>fetch()</code> the data.</p>
<p>I do this by having a placeholder in the pre-built HTML that looks like
this:</p>
<pre><code>MASTODON_POST_ID
</code></pre>
<p>Any place that string appears in the HTML, I replace it with
<code>114011021587416866</code>. (Using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed">sed</a>.)</p>
<p>And where do I get <code>114011021587416866</code>? It's in a file called <code>env.sh</code>
in the directory for this particular blog entry.</p>
<p>It has content in it like this, setting shell environment variables:</p>
<pre><code>MASTODON_POST_ID=114011021587416866
</code></pre>
<p>I source this into the site builder shell script before the build starts
so I can do the substitution.</p>
<p>If that environment variable isn't found, no comments section is emitted.</p>
<p>I use that ID a couple places in the code, so the site builder emits
some HTML for "view" and "reply" buttons that look like this (wrapped
for ease):</p>
<pre><code>&lt;a id="comments-view"
    href="https://mastodon.sdf.org/@beejjorgensen/114011021587416866"
    data-comments-id="114011021587416866"&gt;View Comments&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Note the post ID in the <code>href</code>, but I've also added it to
<code>data-comments-id</code>, which means I can get it in JavaScript like this,
thanks to the whole
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/dataset">dataset</a>
field:</p>
<pre><code>const a_elem = document.querySelector("#comments-view");
const post_id = a_elem.dataset.commentsId;
</code></pre>
<p>However you do it, though, you somehow have to get the Mastodon post ID
into the page.</p>
<h2>What's the API?</h2>
<p>Now, on to business.</p>
<p>It's actually pretty simple to get a post and all its attached comments.
You're going to want to do this for the server you have an account on,
which in my case is <code>mastodon.sdf.org</code>. (<a href="https://sdf.org/">SDF</a> is a
venerable, classic public access Unix system.)</p>
<p>You just have to hit the API endpoint. Let's use the same post ID from
the previous section in this example. Here is the URL to get the
comments (with my example post ID):</p>
<pre><code>https://mastodon.sdf.org/api/v1/statuses/114011021587416866/context
</code></pre>
<p>That's it. You can <a href="https://mastodon.sdf.org/api/v1/statuses/114011021587416866/context">go hit it right
now</a>
in your browser and see the JSON output.</p>
<p>And there's a <em>lot</em> of it.</p>
<p>But for my bit, I only wanted a few pieces from the commenter so that I
could use them to build the comment HTML.</p>
<ol>
<li>Their display name</li>
<li>Their account name</li>
<li>Their avatar URL</li>
<li>Their profile URL</li>
<li>Their content (what they posted)</li>
<li>Their attachments (more on that later)</li>
<li>Their comment Mastodon ID (for blacklist reasons)</li>
</ol>
<p>If we look at the response we got, it has two keys: <code>ancestors</code> and
<code>descendants</code>. The descendants are what we're interested in, i.e. all
the comments made in reply to our post. And <code>descendants</code> is an array of
all those comments.</p>
<p>Let's look at those elements and find what's interesting. Say <code>d = descendants[i]</code>. Then, searching through the JSON, we have:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Field</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>d.account.display_name</code></td>
<td>Their display name</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>d.account.acct</code></td>
<td>Their account name</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>d.account.avatar_static</code></td>
<td>Their avatar URL</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>d.account.display_name</code></td>
<td>Their profile URL</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>d.content</code></td>
<td>Their content (what they posted)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>d.media_attachments</code></td>
<td>Their attachments (an array)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>d.id</code></td>
<td>Their comment Mastodon ID</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<blockquote>
<p><img src="https://beej.us/blog/common/images/goat50.png" alt="Hint Goat">
There's both <code>avatar</code> and <code>avatar_static</code> in the response. The former
might be animated, and the latter is not. You could do something
interesting here like switch to the animated one on mouse-over, but I
didn't bother. I just always used the <code>_static</code> option for the various
images.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So we have what we need, right there in each record.</p>
<h2>JavaScript at Last</h2>
<p>All we need to do is <code>fetch()</code> that information with our Mastodon post
ID that we baked into our static HTML. There are no credentials needed
to access public posts (so be sure to make your Mastodon post public).</p>
<p>But when should we fetch? Should we do it on page load? When the element
becomes visible? On a click?</p>
<p>If you have a high-traffic site, you might start raising the ire of your
Mastodon server admins if you repeatedly hit that URL. My site is
nowhere near those limits, so I <em>could</em> just load the comments after my
blog loads.</p>
<p>But I don't like extra overhead unless the user wants it, so instead I
hooked it up to a link. The comments will only appear on the page if the
user clicks the "View Comments" link.</p>
<p>A compromise might be to lazily load the comments when the user scrolls
down enough for them to be visible. But I just went for manual. (I drive
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_transmission">stick</a>, too, BTW.)</p>
<p>In any case, we'll need a function to load the comments, and it'll look
like this:</p>
<pre><code>async load_comments(ev) {
    const post_id = MASTODON_POST_ID;

    // Change the URL to your server
    const url = `https://mastodon.sdf.org/api/v1/statuses/${post_id}/context`

    try {
        const response = await fetch(url);
        if (!response.ok) {
            throw new Error(`Response status: ${response.status}`);
        }

        const json = await response.json();

        populate_comments(json);

    } catch (error) {
        alert(`Error loading comments: ${error.message}`);
        console.error(error.message);
    }

}
</code></pre>
<p>It's an async function that uses the <code>fetch()</code> API to get the data for
my Mastodon post that corresponds to this blog entry.</p>
<p>Once it has loaded, we call <code>populate_comments()</code> with the JSON data to
actually build out the HTML. Let's talk about that next.</p>
<h2>Building the HTML</h2>
<p>This all depends on how you want your stuff to look at the end of the
day.</p>
<p>I wanted something that looked like what we have at the bottom of this
page, so I have some code that generates these. Here's what it looks
like (obviously with values substituted in where appropriate):</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div class="mast-comment"&gt;
    &lt;div class="mast-comment-header"&gt;
        &lt;div class="mast-comment-avatar"&gt;
            &lt;a href="ACCOUNT_URL"&gt;
                &lt;img src="ACCOUNT_AVATAR_URL"&gt;
            &lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="mast-comment-ident"&gt;
            &lt;div class="mast-comment-acct"&gt;
                &lt;a href="ACCOUNT_URL"&gt;
                    ACCOUNT_NAME
                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="mast-comment-display-name"&gt;
                &lt;a href="ACCOUNT_URL"&gt;
                    ACCOUNT_DISPLAY_NAME
                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="mast-comment-content"&gt;
        COMMENT_CONTENT
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;!-- attachment HTML goes here --&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Having it in that form allowed me to add some <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout/Basic_concepts_of_flexbox">flexbox
CSS</a>
to lay out the whole thing.</p>
<p>I basically just appended a bunch of those to a string and then dumped
it into the <code>innerHTML</code> of the comments block.</p>
<p>Note that the record <code>content</code> field is already HTML-encoded so there's
no need to do that again. (And if you do, you'll lose the comment
formatting and just display a bunch of HTML tags.)</p>
<h2>Media Attachments</h2>
<p>This was interesting. Users can attach things to their posts. And then
the question becomes what to do with them. The real Mastodon client will
display previews of the attachments that you can click on to get the
whole thing.</p>
<p>I'm going simpler with my stuff. Basically I'm just going to put a link
with a text description. I don't want the comments to be too polluted
with media.</p>
<p>We can find the media attachments in the <code>media_attachments</code> field,
which, if present, is an array.</p>
<p>I just needed a few pieces of information from each <code>media_attachments</code>
entry. Let's assume that <code>a = rec.media_attachments[i]</code>, and then we
have:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Field</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>a.type</code></td>
<td>The attachment type</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>a.url</code></td>
<td>The attachment location</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>a.description</code></td>
<td>The attachment text description</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/entities/MediaAttachment/#type">spec
says</a> the
<code>type</code> can be a few things:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Type</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>unknown</code></td>
<td>Unsupported or unrecognized file type</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>image</code></td>
<td>Static image</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>gifv</code></td>
<td>Looping, soundless animation</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>video</code></td>
<td>Video clip</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>audio</code></td>
<td>Audio track</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I used the <code>type</code> to choose an emoji icon that was appropriate (🖼️ 🎦 🎶
📎), then used the <code>description</code> for the text underlying a link to the
<code>url</code>. One per line. No preview. Kept it simple.</p>
<p>So I had <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements that I tucked into main comment <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> where
the "attachment HTML goes here" comment was, above.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div class="mast-comment-attachment"&gt;
    ICON_EMOJI&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="URL"&gt;DESCRIPTION&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2>Replying</h2>
<p>100% punted on this. You click the "reply" button on my page and it
takes you straight to my blog post announcement on Mastodon. If you want
to reply, you need a Mastodon account and reply from there.</p>
<p>As such, the comments on my page are "read only". They are just a view
onto the live comments that are on Mastodon.</p>
<h2>Blacklisting</h2>
<p>I wanted to be able to blacklist entire accounts (<code>@user@example.com</code>)
or individual comment IDs (the big number referencing that comment).</p>
<p>This wouldn't change what was actually on Mastodon, but it would filter
out comments I didn't want to see on my blog site.</p>
<p>Remember how I jammed the Mastodon announcement post ID into my static
HTML by putting it in the JavaScript variable <code>MASTODON_POST_ID</code>? Well,
I do a similar thing for the blacklist.</p>
<p>In my environment shell script, I include a blacklist like this:</p>
<pre><code>MASTODON_BLACKLIST=@user@example.com,123456789,345678912
</code></pre>
<p>The numbers can be either a post ID or an account ID.</p>
<p>And my processing scripts turn that into JavaScript that looks like
this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;MASTODON_BLACKLIST = new Set([
    "@user@example.com",
    "123456789",
    "345678912"
]);&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>And then I can pass an entire <code>descendants</code> record into this function
which will return <code>true</code> if it is blacklisted. It tests the comment
record ID, the poster account ID, and the poster account login to see if
any of them are in the blacklist. If so, no comment block is emitted for
that record.</p>
<pre><code>function blacklisted(rec)
{
    const bl = MASTODON_BLACKLIST;

    return bl.has(rec.id) ||
        bl.has(rec.account.id) ||
        bl.has(rec.account.acct);
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Getting the Comment ID</h3>
<p>If I see some offensive content, I can see who posted it because my
comments viewer shows their name. But my comments viewer does not show
their comment post ID.</p>
<p>And what if I want to block just that one post?</p>
<p>What I did was wire it up so that if I held <code>ALT</code> and clicked on the
comment, it would display the comment ID underneath the comment. (And
remove it if I clicked again.)</p>
<h3>Adding to the Blacklist</h3>
<p>If I want to block someone, I do the following.</p>
<ol>
<li>If I want to block their account, I add their account login to my
<code>MASTODON_BLACKLIST</code> environment variable. If I want to block just
that comment, I <code>ALT</code>-click on it to get the ID, and then add that ID
to the blacklist variable.</li>
<li>I rebuild the site. It's static, so I need to get the new blacklist
baked into the HTML. (I could also just rebuild this one page, but
since it takes 0.5 seconds to rebuild the entire site currently, I
just go for it.)</li>
<li>I deploy the site.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Global Blacklist</h3>
<p>Right now I'm blacklisting people and comments on a per-blog-entry
basis. But I'll probably modify my site builder to also support a global
blacklist for people I want to ban on <strong>all</strong> my blog posts.</p>
<p>Hopefully I never have to do that.</p>
<h2>Chicken and Egg</h2>
<p>I have to put the blog post online so I can link to it from the Mastodon
announcement post.</p>
<p>I have to put the Mastodon announcement post online so I can refer to it
from the blog post.</p>
<p>So there's just a moment where the comments don't show. Reviewing the
launch process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make the blog entry live with no comments.</li>
<li>Link to it from Mastodon in the announcement post.</li>
<li>Take the announcement post ID and use it to rebuild the blog entry.</li>
<li>Re-deploy the blog entry.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course this could all be automated through the appropriate APIs to
minimize that window, but I'm not going to bother for my low traffic.</p>
<h2>Maiden Voyage</h2>
<p>This is the first post where I'm trying this out. So feel free to reply
and I'll find out where all the breakages are. 😅</p>

During the development of <i>Civilization VII</i>, Firaxis Games reached out to Ben Barnes, chief of the Shawnee Tribe, to discuss the possibility of incorporating Shawnee history into the game. By chance, Chief Barnes is a longtime fan of strategy games, including the <i>Civilization</i> series, and these conversations eventually blossomed into an ongoing relationship of shared knowledge and resources which not only led to more accurate and meaningful in-game depictions, but also real gains in preserving Shawnee language and culture for future generations.</p><p>In 2021, the team at Firaxis began working with the Tribe to make sure the in-game <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/game-guide/civilizations/shawnee/"><u>Shawnee</u></a> civilization* and the visionary leader <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/game-guide/leaders/tecumseh/"><u>Tecumseh</u></a>*—who is included in <i>Civ VII</i>'s expansive roster of playable leaders, voiced by Shawnee actor Dillon Dean—were respectfully represented. In addition to faithfully incorporating the Shawnee language in-game, the developers researched archeological material, studied old family photographs, and consulted with cultural knowledge-keepers while carefully shaping how the Tribe was characterized.</p><p>Then, in February 2025, the next phase of our collaboration culminated in the grand opening of the George "Fife" Blanchard Yaatakciitonooteeki (Recording Studio) in Miami, Oklahoma. Paying homage to George Blanchard, a fluent Shawnee language speaker and visionary leader in his own right, the studio is fully equipped to produce audio recordings of the highest quality and support the Tribe's<a href="https://library.municode.com/tribes_and_tribal_nations/shawnee_tribe/munidocs/munidocs?nodeId=474b75806676f" target="_blank"> <u>ongoing preservation efforts</u></a>. The Shawnee Tribe is almost halfway through its "Decade of the Shawnee Language," and this new space will significantly bolster their work.</p><p>Of course, it also warmed our hearts to see Chief Ben Barnes as thrilled as we are to showcase the Shawnee in <i>Civilization VII</i>. It's been an honor to work alongside the Tribe in this fulfilling partnership, and now that the game has launched worldwide, we can't wait for more players to build something they believe in while embodying Tecumseh and leading the Shawnee in <i>Civ VII </i>for years to come!</p><p><i>*Tecumseh leader and Shawnee civilization are part of the Tecumseh and Shawnee Pack DLC. The Tecumseh and Shawnee Pack is included in the Deluxe and Founders Editions of Civilization VII. It will also be available for separate purchase starting April 15, 2025 (base game required, date subject to change).</i> </p></div><!--[--><!--]--><!----></article><!----></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">What is mdq?</h2><a id="user-content-what-is-mdq" aria-label="Permalink: What is mdq?" href="#what-is-mdq"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">mdq aims to do for Markdown what jq does for JSON: provide an easy way to zero in on specific parts of a document.</p>
<p dir="auto">For example, GitHub PRs are Markdown documents, and some organizations have specific templates with checklists for all
reviewers to complete. Enforcing these often requires ugly regexes that are a pain to write and worse to debug. Instead,
you can (for example) ask mdq for all uncompleted tasks:</p>

<p dir="auto">mdq is available under the Apache 2.0 or MIT licenses, at your option. I am open to other permissive licenses, if you
have one you prefer.</p>

</li>
<li>Download binaries from <a href="https://github.com/yshavit/mdq/releases/latest">the latest release</a> (or any other release, of course).</li>
<li>You can also grab the binaries from the latest <a href="https://github.com/yshavit/mdq/actions/workflows/build-release.yml">build-release</a> workflow run. You must be logged into GitHub to do
that (this is GitHub's limitation, not mine). You'll have to <code>chmod +x</code> them before you can run them.</li>
</ol>
<details>
<summary>Security concerns</summary>
The release and latest-workflow binaries are built on GitHub's servers, so if you trust my code (and dependencies), and you trust GitHub,
you can trust the binaries. See <a href="https://github.com/yshavit/mdq/wiki/Release-binaries">https://github.com/yshavit/mdq/wiki/Release-binaries</a> for information on how to verify them.

          <ul>
              <li>Translations are generated by Google Translate. Some may be inaccurate or use non-European (e.g. Brazilian Portuguese) words.</li>
              <li>Just one translation is provided for each word; watch out for words with multiple meanings!</li>

                                         If Google Translate cannot find a translation, it simply shows the English word.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/ukosa1/uk_users_lobsters_needs_your_help_with">https://lobste.rs/s/ukosa1/uk_users_lobsters_needs_your_help_with</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43152178">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Hey folks,</p>
<p>The UK’s <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2023/50/contents" rel="ugc">Online Safety Act</a> is scheduled to take effect on <strong>March 16, 2025</strong>.
Lobsters can’t comply with it and needs your help to avoid having to geoblock the UK.</p>
<p>The Online Safety Act regulates most sites where users can interact with each other.
The law explicitly claims authority over all forums with <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2023/50/section/227" rel="ugc">visitors located in the UK</a>, regardless of where they are hosted or the nationality of their owners.</p>
<p>As a practical matter, Lobsters can’t comply.
The OSA is written for commercial sites far bigger than this <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/95uler/would_there_be_interest_patreon_for#c_9l58ia" rel="ugc">non-commercial, hobbyist</a> forum.
The regulator’s <a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/" rel="ugc">statements</a> include many long, cross-referenced legalese documents
(an incomplete sample, because I can’t find a directory):
<a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/siteassets/resources/documents/online-safety/information-for-industry/illegal-harms/summary-of-each-chapter.pdf?v=387528" rel="ugc">1</a>
<a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/siteassets/resources/documents/online-safety/information-for-industry/roadmap/2024/ofcoms-approach-to-implementing-the-online-safety-act-2024.pdf?v=383285" rel="ugc">2</a>
<a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/siteassets/resources/documents/online-safety/information-for-industry/illegal-harms/risk-assessment-guidance-and-risk-profiles.pdf?v=388231" rel="ugc">3</a>
<a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/siteassets/resources/documents/online-safety/information-for-industry/illegal-harms/summary-of-our-decisions.pdf?v=387523" rel="ugc">4</a>
<a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/siteassets/resources/documents/online-safety/information-for-industry/illegal-harms/illegal-content-codes-of-practice-for-user-to-user-services.pdf?v=387711" rel="ugc">5</a>.
Sites are required to produce lengthy documentation about their features, practices, and risks - both up-front and as they moderate.
Attempting to understand which sections apply and how to comply would be a huge project.
Doing so <em>correctly</em> would require legal advice we <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/ffd4xt/lfgss_microcosm_shutting_down_16th_march#c_cdfjmr" rel="ugc">can’t afford</a>.
The cost in time and money to implement the bureaucratic processes it demands also outstrip a hobbyist forum.</p>
<p>There’s also an ideological matter, that Lobsters is not a UK entity or operated in its jurisdiction.
The OSA isn’t written to directly regulate the UK’s occupants, it exerts authority over non-UK maintainers of sites that UK occupants read.
Even if the OSA was proportionate and reasonable, complying would encourage every jurisdiction to write similarly broad laws.</p>
<p>The OSA’s civil penalties run up to $22 million USD, and it includes also criminal penalties.
While poor and despotic countries have written laws to curtail freedom of speech internationally online (usually a broadly over-enforced “no criticizing the rulers”), as a practical matter those have been vanishingly unlikely to be enforced against Western citizens.
Because the UK is wealthy, powerful, and threatening large penalties, I can’t ignore the risk that the UK attempts to enforce the law against Lobsters, perhaps to make a political point against American Big Tech as <a href="https://www.verdict.co.uk/osa-mandates-illegal-content-risk-assessments/" rel="ugc">promised by the regulator</a>.</p>
<p>So the current, bad plan is that Lobsters will <a href="https://github.com/lobsters/lobsters/commit/259b9117edb8dfff289b54a68a17af6461f8815b" rel="ugc">geoblock the UK before the law takes effect</a> on March 16.
While the inaccuracy of IP databases and availability of VPNs mean that this can’t be perfectly accurate, unambiguously blocking UK occupants as effectively as we can is the only course I see to substantially reduce the risk the OSA is enforced against the site.</p>
<p><strong>UK users, we need you to please help improve this situation.</strong>
You have the local knowledge and political representation needed to address the OSA.
I can see a couple courses of action that would sufficiently mitigate the risk:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some kind of guidance or waiver from the implementing regulator <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofcom" rel="ugc">Ofcom</a> that this law won’t apply to Lobsters individually or as a class of non-UK, small, and/or noncommercial forums.</li>
<li>Delay or cancellation of the Parliamentary approval required for the regulator’s guidance to be adopted into legal effect, at least until something like the previous option can happen.</li>
<li>Legal advice from a UK lawyer that the law does not apply to Lobsters for some plausible reason.</li>
<li>A statement from the US <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State" rel="ugc">Department of State</a> that it does not believe the law applies to American entities and a commitment to defend them against it.</li>
<li>Something else I haven’t thought of that would greatly reduce the risk the OSA is enforced against Lobsters.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m reaching out to people I know who also run sites that will be affected by the OSA, in and out of the UK, to ask how they’re handling this.
I’m also reaching out to organizations that focus on online rights like the EFF and <a href="https://www.openrightsgroup.org/campaign/stop-state-censorship-of-online-speech/" rel="ugc">ORG</a>.
I’ll post update in the comments below so this story will be the best single resource to watch for news.</p>
<p>There’s more background info and thoughts in the <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/ffd4xt/lfgss_microcosm_shutting_down_16th_march" rel="ugc">story on LFGSS shutting down</a>, <a href="https://push.cx/stream/2024-12-19-uk-online-safety-act" rel="ugc">previous</a> and <a href="https://push.cx/stream/2025-01-06-hello-i-am-your-constitutent-from-chicago" rel="ugc">today’s</a> office hours streams, which include searchable transcripts.</p>
<p>There are a lot of distracting off-topic rabbit holes here like recent political events, international diplomacy, defining “free speech”, pretending to practice UK law, and many more - please do try to stay focused on the existential problem at hand.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help,</p>
<ul>
<li>Peter</li>
</ul>

																<p>Doctored: Fraud, Arrogance, and Tragedy in the Quest to Cure Alzheimer's</p>
																
									</section>

				<p>In December 2021, I fell into one of the biggest and most disturbing stories of my career. A credible whistleblower with strong credentials in dementia research tipped me to a major case of apparent misconduct in his field. He produced convincing evidence that lab studies at the heart of the dominant hypothesis for the cause of Alzheimer’s disease might have been based on bogus data. My investigative story for Science magazine in July 2022 exposed those findings and their far-reaching significance, drawing global media attention. But I didn’t suspect it would begin a yearslong, high-stakes journey into hidden, sordid corners of science and medicine.</p>
<p>Just a couple months later, two giant drug companies announced what many described as one of the most dramatic developments in the history of Alzheimer’s. For decades scientists had struggled fruitlessly to offer hope to millions of patients who suffer the gradual, debilitating decline in their ability to think and remember loved ones, or enjoy self-aware lives. Finally, a major test seemed to prove that a new medication could alter the course of the disease.</p>
<p>That drug, Leqembi, strips away from brain tissues the sticky plaques and other toxic compounds that comprise a substance called “amyloid-beta.” In so doing- said its makers, experts in their pay, and cheerleading <span>journalists—Leqembi definitively validated the “amyloid hypothesis,;” the long-debated notion that Alzheimer’s is caused by the buildup accumulation of amyloid in the brain. If true, its removal would lead to a cure. </span></p>
<p><span>Understandable excitement—hope against hope—greeted Leqembi. Alzheimer’s afflicts nearly seven million Americans, about one in every nine over the age of sixty-five, making it the fifth leading cause of death among the elderly. Up to 360,000 adults in the prime of life-including people as young as thirty-suffer from early onset Alzheimer’s. Comparable figures in the United Kingdom, Europe, and the rest of the world have made the leading cause of dementia a global scourge. And dementia totals will more than double by 2050. </span></p>
<p><span>In the United States alone, more than eleven million family members care for fathers and mothers and grandparents who have fallen prey to the cruel disease that begins by gradually stealing a person’s mastery of everyday life, then cherished memories, and finally the sense of self that makes each of us human. Alzheimer’s families face incalculable emotional costs—including lost dreams of retirement and pleasures with loving partners. For many, the disease also means financial impoverishment. Family caregivers in the United States provided a staggering $350 billion in care to Alzheimer’s patients in 2023—nearly matching the amount paid for dementia care by all other sources, including Medicare. </span></p>

		</a>
		<p><span>Unfortunately, the Leqembi “breakthrough” amounted to just this: Alzheimer’s patients lost their ability to remember, think clearly, and live normal lives only slightly less rapidly than others taking a bogus treatment. The drug offers so modest a benefit that doctors and patients might not perceive any effect whatsoever. </span></p>
<p><span>It was the latest example of the exaggeration, hype, and sheer fakery and fraud that has characterized Alzheimer’s research for decades. By then I realized that I could tell the full story of how the hunt to cure the insidious and chilling illness went awry. I had to show why billions of dollars in spending by governments, pharma companies, and philanthropies had done little for desperate patients. </span></p>
<p><span>For decades, proponents of the dominant amyloid hypothesis have sidelined, starved for resources, and even bullied rebels behind other promising notions of how to treat Alzheimer’s. If Leqembi and look-alikes with similarly lackluster results hold sway in drug development and dominate mindshare among patients and doctors, a genuine Alzheimer’s cure might become even more remote. </span></p>
<p><span>Many patients take a leap of faith in such drugs as a hedge against creeping fear. Big pharma companies, among others, bet their bottom lines on that basic instinct. Alzheimer’s research has offered endless opportunities for advancement and riches to corporate shysters and ruthlessly ambitious scientists who cut corners or engage in brazen deception. I set out to unmask decades of arrogance, greed, fabulism, and error that have emptied research coffers and littered the drug development landscape with failure after failure. </span></p>
<p><span>My reporting followed the path of a junior professor who faced great personal risks to challenge his field’s institutional powers. He uncovered hidden and fabricated data instrumental to keeping the amyloid hypothesis supreme at the expense of other possible solutions. As I dug deeper, a scientific under world of deceit and lies rose into view. I gradually saw an opportunity to help reshape how scientists, doctors, and patients understand one of the most terrible human afflictions-and add realistic hope in the process. </span></p>
<p><span>The story begins where it must, with a deeply determined patient struggling with dementia. He dared to hope that he could be one of the first people living with Alzheimer’s to find a transformative treatment.</span></p>

<p dir="auto">Since the release of <code>Gnome 43.0</code>, more and more built-in apps use <code>libadwaita</code> now, and libadwaita does not support custom themes, which means we cannot change the appearance of app using libadwaita through <code>gnome-tweaks</code> or <code>dconf-editor</code>. For users who love custom themes, it’s really sucks!</p>
<p dir="auto">Anyway if anybody who still want to custom themes we can only do this way:</p>
<p dir="auto">that is to use the <code>theme file</code> to overwrite the <code>gtk-4.0 configuration file</code>. The result is that only Fixed making all gtk4 apps use one theme and cannot be switched (even can not switch to dark mode) If you want to change a theme, you can only re-overwrite the <code>gtk-4.0 configuration file</code> with a new theme, I know this method is not perfect, But at the moment it is only possible to continue using themes for libadwaita's apps ...</p>

<p>(TL;DR:  Ultima VII: Revisited is a replacement engine for Ultima VII that presents the game in 3D and fixes various issue with the game.  Go to the <a href="https://www.u7revisited.com/downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Downloads tab">Downloads tab</a> to find out how to get it.)</p>

<p><em>Preview of coming attractions.</em></p>



<p><strong>My name is Anthony Salter and I love Ultima.</strong></p>



<p>The Ultima Series of classic RPGs was created by Richard Garriott (also known as Lord British) along with a bunch of his friends.  It represents, in my opinion, the epitome of the ingenuity, beauty and superb design of DOS games.</p>



<p>Ultima games were designed in a unique way.  Garriott would build an RPG world, filling it with merchants, monsters and dungeons…but no characters or plot.  That would only come after the world had been fully created.</p>



<p>And the worlds he created were as real as he could make them. Day/night cycles, phases of the moon, names and schedules for every character, and a complex dialogue system that required players to actually find keywords in the world to ask characters about. Many fans, myself included, consider Ultima VII to be the epitome of the series’ design, doing things that even now modern games can’t.</p>



<figure><video autoplay="" controls="" loop="" muted="" src="https://www.u7revisited.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Exult-Ultima7-Engine-2023-08-06-18-44-51-1.mp4"></video></figure>



<p><em>I just changed a baby’s diaper.  If I want, I can keep the dirty diaper and throw it at an enemy to make them run away in disgust.</em></p>



<p>So why do people have so much trouble getting into the game nowadays?  Why do reviews like this exist?</p>



<figure><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="339" src="https://www.u7revisited.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/U7Review-1024x339.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.u7revisited.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/U7Review-1024x339.png 1024w, https://www.u7revisited.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/U7Review-300x99.png 300w, https://www.u7revisited.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/U7Review-768x254.png 768w, https://www.u7revisited.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/U7Review.png 1148w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>A modern gamer tries to play Ultima VII.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Well, they exist because of this.</p>



<figure><video autoplay="" controls="" loop="" muted="" src="https://www.u7revisited.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Exult-Ultima7-Engine-2023-08-06-15-57-44.mp4"></video></figure>



<p><em>That’s not a video issue, that’s the actual frame rate of the game.</em></p>



<p>And this.</p>



<figure><video autoplay="" controls="" loop="" muted="" src="https://www.u7revisited.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Exult-Ultima7-Engine-2023-08-06-16-09-10.mp4"></video></figure>



<p><em>Your companions are bottomless pits and are incapable of feeding themselves.</em></p>



<p>And this.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="640" height="400" src="https://www.u7revisited.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/u7dark-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.u7revisited.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/u7dark-1.png 640w, https://www.u7revisited.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/u7dark-1-300x188.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></figure>



<p><em>Yes, that’s right – palette effects that make the environment darker also make the user interface darker.</em></p>



<p>Now, those of us who played the game back in the day put up with all of this because we didn’t feel like we were “putting up” with anything.  Previous games had far worse issues, and Ultima VII played better and presented a more cohesive world than anything that came before.</p>



<p>But, yes, it feels clunky and dated today.  And while there’s an amazing replacement engine called Exult that helps with a lot of this, its goal is to replicate the original game as closely as possible, which means it can’t solve Ultima VII’s greatest problem – that it was simply ahead of its time.  Ultima VII is a 3D world stuck in a 2D engine.</p>



<p>Every object in the world has width, depth and height, and the world itself consists of 3072x3072x16 tile blocks.  Ultima VII was in development from 1990 to 1992 (shipping in April ’92), and even though software 3D was taking off at the time, it hadn’t been designed as a 3D game (even though it used a 3D world) and that contributed to its issues.</p>



<p>But software-rendered 3D games with isometric perspectives started coming out very soon after Ultima VII, and every time I saw one I thought, “This is what Ultima VII should have looked like.”</p>



<figure><video autoplay="" controls="" loop="" muted="" src="https://www.u7revisited.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/DOSBox-0.74-2.1-Cpu-speed_-165000-cycles-Frameskip-0-Program_-KEEPER-2023-01-25-00-28-04.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>Bullfrog Productions’ <em>Dungeon Keeper</em>.</p>



<figure><video autoplay="" controls="" loop="" muted="" src="https://www.u7revisited.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MYTH-2023-01-25-01-02-02.mp4"></video></figure>



<p><em>Myth II: Soulblighter</em>, by Bungie (yes, that Bungie).</p>



<figure><video autoplay="" controls="" loop="" muted="" src="https://www.u7revisited.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/grandiaintro-1.mp4"></video></figure>



<p><em>Grandia</em>, by Game Arts.  Just look at that city flyby!</p>



<p>So my goal with Ultima VII: Revisited is to present the world of Britannia in a 3D engine, using a more modern (but not too modern) presentation.  I will also be smoothing off some of the rough corners, like the inventory and combat systems.  My goal is to create a new way of playing Ultima VII that will allow the gamer who posted the review above to understand exactly why Ultima VII is so amazing.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  

  
  

  <div>
  <blockquote>
<p>The very short version: it is madness to continue transferring the running of European societies and governments to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-inauguration-tech-billionaires-zuckerberg-musk-wealth-0896bfc3f50d941d62cebc3074267ecd">American clouds</a>. Not only is it a terrible idea given the kind of things the “<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/king-trump-rcna192912">King of America</a>” keeps saying, the legal sophistry used to justify such transfers, like the <a href="https://berthub.eu/tkconv/document.html?nummer=2025D07118">nonsense letter the Dutch cabinet sent last week</a>, has now been <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/trump-s-sacking-of-pclob-members-threatens-data-privacy">invalidated</a> by Trump himself. And why are we doing this? Convenience. But it is very scary to make yourself 100% dependent on the goodwill of the American government merely because it is convenient. So let’s not.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We used to think that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_stages_of_grief">grieving went through five stages</a>: denial, protest, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. We no longer really believe in that theory, but when it comes to dealing with the US, many Europeans are however currently busily negotiating with reality.</p>
<p>Some of my more activist friends are already further along in their thinking, and clearly see that it is ridiculous to move our governments over to the American clouds at this stage. They rightly accused me of <a href="https://mastodon.nl/@bert_hubert/114015060901981839">fooling myself</a> by aiming for ‘<a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/communicating-without-musk-and-trump-cloud-kootwijk/">at least not moving EVERYTHING to America</a>’, while accepting that we’d still relinquish the majority of our systems.</p>
<p>Acknowledging painful changes <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@bert_hubert/111402692560132040">is not easy</a>. In the 1930s, the Netherlands realized the world was becoming pretty dangerous, and therefore <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_1047_battlecruiser">planned to buy weapons</a> and ammunition from Germany (!). However, the ordered weaponry was not delivered on time, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_bombing_of_Rotterdam">at least not in the way you’d want</a>.</p>
<p>“Negotiating with reality” is for example <a href="https://berthub.eu/tkconv/document.html?nummer=2025D07118">the letter three Dutch government ministers sent last week</a>. Is it wise to report every applicant to your secret service directly to Google, just to get some statistics? The answer the government sent: even if we do that, we don’t, because “<a href="https://mastodon.nl/@bert_hubert/114031686141633446">Google cannot see the IP address</a>”. This is complete nonsense of course, but it’s the kind of thing you tell yourself (or let others tell you) when you don’t want to face reality (or can’t).</p>
<center>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://berthub.eu/articles/google-ip.png"><br>
Live image of IP addresses that, according to the Dutch government, don’t go to Google, <a href="https://cookie-script.com/blog/ip-anonymization/amp">but actually do go to Google</a></p>
</center>
<p>And why are we reporting all these job applicants to America? Because it’s <em>cheaper</em>, they say. The European alternative statistical software, which is already paid for and actually running on the government job site, isn’t as user-friendly either, they say. Nonsense.</p>
<p>With all sorts of magic legal spells  like “<a href="https://www.autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl/en/themes/basic-gdpr/gdpr-in-practice/data-protection-impact-assessment-dpia">DPIAs</a>” and “<a href="https://highberg.com/insights/how-do-you-conduct-a-dtia">DTIAs</a>,” organizations attempt to justify transferring our data and processes to the US. <a href="https://www.privacycompany.eu/">There is a whole industry that has been aiding and abetting this process for years</a>. People also <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/servers-in-de-eu-eigen-sleutels-helpt-het/">fool themselves that special keys and “servers in the EU”</a> will get you “<a href="https://www.ncsc.nl/binaries/ncsc/documenten/publicaties/2022/augustus/16/cloud-act-memo/Cloud+Act+Memo+Final.pdf">a safe space</a>” within the American cloud. <a href="https://edri.org/our-work/promises-unkept-the-eu-us-data-privacy-framework-under-fire/">It won’t</a>.</p>
<p>All these efforts are not about whether it is <em>wise</em> to hand over control of our data to the US. It is all about if it is <em>lawful</em>.</p>
<p>But it won’t be lawful either — the legal basis for sharing personal data with American companies is dead since Donald Trump has neutered the special court <a href="https://noyb.eu/en/us-cloud-soon-illegal-trump-punches-first-hole-eu-us-data-deal">that would make such transfers legal</a>.</p>

</center>
<p>We now have the bizarre situation that anyone with any sense can see <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/france/article/2025/02/19/macron-holds-second-day-of-emergency-talks-on-ukraine_6738336_7.html">that America is no longer a reliable partner</a>, and that <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-inauguration-tech-billionaires-zuckerberg-musk-wealth-0896bfc3f50d941d62cebc3074267ecd">the entire US business world bows to Trump’s dictatorial will</a>, but we STILL are doing <a href="https://www.utoday.nl/news/75233/waarom-mag-chatgpt-reclame-maken-bij-surf">everything we can</a> to transfer entire governments and most of our own businesses to their clouds.</p>
<p>Not only is it scary to have all your data available to US spying, it is also <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/publicspaces-digitale-autonomie-7-juni-2024/">a huge risk for your business/government continuity</a>. From now on, all our business processes can be brought to a halt <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/digitale-soevereiniteit-rijksoverheid-13-februari-2025/">with the push of a button in the US</a>. And not only will everything then stop, will we ever get our data back? <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/ransom-cloud.jpeg">Or are we being held hostage</a>? This is not a theoretical scenario, <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/servers-in-de-eu-eigen-sleutels-helpt-het/#wat-als-er-ruzie-is">something like this has already happened</a>.</p>
<p>Here and there, some parts of at least the Dutch government are deciding <a href="https://berthub.eu/tkconv/document.html?nummer=2025D06767">not to <em>migrate EVERYTHING</em> to the US</a> (kudos to the government workers who are fighting for this!).</p>
<p>But even here, the details of Dutch policy are that our data will only ‘<a href="https://berthub.eu/tkconv/document.html?nummer=2025D06768">for now</a>’ stay on our own servers. Experts are also doubtful whether it’s actually possible with the current “partial cloud” plan to keep the data here <em>exclusively</em>.</p>
<p>And then we come to the apparent reason why <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/de-hele-overheid-naar-de-cloud-dat-is-een-politiek-besluit/">we are putting our head on Trump’s chopping block</a>: “American software is just so easy to use”.</p>
<p>Personally, I don’t know many fans of MS Teams, Office, and Outlook. We are, however, very <em>used</em> to these software products. We’ve become quite good at using them.</p>
<p>But this brings us to the unbearable conclusion that we are entrusting all our data and business processes to the new <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/king-trump-rcna192912">King of America</a>… because we can’t be bothered to <em>get used to</em> a <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">different word processor</a>, or make an effort to <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/open-source-by-itself-is-no-alternative-for-big-tech/">support other software</a>.</p>
<p>Written down like this, it seems pretty bizarre, and that’s because it is. It’s also not easy to realize that <a href="https://www.vpro.nl/buitenhof/lees/in-de-uitzending/2025/26-januari.html">our relationship with America is over after 80 years</a>. It took time for me as well to accept that.</p>
<p>But it really is over. Stop the nonsense of complicated and long-winded legal arguments about why it would be legal to put our citizens’ data in the US. These arguments are not only naïve—they are also no longer true. The US has dismantled the official privacy framework. <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@bert_hubert/114032472494922878">The deal is dead</a>.</p>
<p>So stop surrendering our society to America. Have the courage to use <a href="https://opendesk.eu/en/ueber/">different software</a> and services. <a href="https://opendesk.eu/en/">Even if it takes some getting used to</a>.</p>
<p>And maybe, once in a while, European governments should have the guts to actually attempt to buy something else. <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/is-europe-just-not-good-at-innovating/">Innovation doesn’t just happen without the promise of revenues</a>. Spending just 1% on alternatives would mean billions of euros.</p>
<p>That’s a very small price to pay for a society that isn’t 100% dependent on “MAGA”, Donald Trump and Elon Musk. The world is <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/cyber-security-pre-war-reality-check/">far too dangerous</a> for that.</p>

            <div>
                
                <p>There's a cute math puzzle that can be interesting to folks on very
different levels:</p>
<blockquote>
Given exactly four instances of the digit 2 and some target natural number,
use any mathematical operations to generate the target number with these 2s,
using no other digits.</blockquote>
<p>Some examples can be done by elementary school kids:</p>
<p>In middle school, kids learn about exponents, factorials, etc. which expands the
range considerably:</p>
<p>Then come the tricks; for example, the number 22 (twenty two) can be seen as
a valid use of two 2s, and so on; so we can have:</p>
<p>Getting to 7 is notoriously difficult, but if you allow even more mathematical
tools like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_function">Gamma function</a>,
it becomes easy:</p>
<p>The more math skill people have, the more numbers they can make. See
<a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1034122/get-the-numbers-from-0-30-by-using-the-number-2-four-times">this thread</a>
for some fun concoctions using integrals, repeating fractions and combinatorial
operators. One of my favorite examples involves complex numbers:</p>
<p>So the fun doesn't end even after one graduates from university! In fact, this
seems to have been a favorite pastime for mathematicians in the 1920s. Until
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Dirac">Paul Dirac</a> ruined it for everyone
by finding a general solution for every number.</p>
<p>It's all about nested square roots:</p>
<p>If the square root is applied <em>n</em> times:</p>
<p>All that's left now is some base-2 logarithms:</p>
<p>And another:</p>
<p>This leads to the general formula:</p>
<p>There's just one small wrinkle: it uses <em>three</em> instances of the digit 2, not
four. This is easy to amend, however; since , we can replace
any single digit with that and get exactly four:</p>
<p>One may claim this is cheating, but it seems to be in line with the rules of
the puzzle! Note that the entity <em>n</em> doesn't actually appear anywhere - it's
just a helper to count the number of repeated square roots. For example, another
way to express 7 is:</p>
<p>There are exactly four 2s, and this uses only reasonable, elemental math
operations to do the calculation. It's clear that <em>any</em> number can be expressed
this way; the only challenge is properly drawing all those square roots!</p>

      <p>A man who has been released from prison after 30 years for a crime he says he never committed has been readjusting to life - and getting used to just how connected people are now. </p><p>Gordon Cordeiro was jailed in 1994 over the murder of Timothy Blaisdell on the island of Maui, but due to new DNA evidence his conviction was overturned on Friday.</p>
<p>Speaking about his first impression of the outside world following his release from Maui Community Correctional Center, Mr Cordeiro, who has always maintained his innocence, said he has been trying to get used to how connected people are.</p><p>"Everybody is looking at their phones," he said, during his first Zoom interview since leaving prison.</p><p>Mr Cordeiro also commented on the new DNA evidence which led to his release, telling the Associated Press news agency: "Thank God for new DNA. Technology is awesome."</p>

<p>The first thing he did after he was freed was visit his mother's grave as he said he had constantly thought about her during his time behind bars.</p><p>Mr Cordeiro's mother, Paulette, died aged 49 in September 1994 from ALS, often called Lou Gehrig's disease. Her son was arrested the following month.</p><p>"Thanks for looking over me. Keeping me safe," Mr Cordeiro recalled saying at her grave.</p><p>In a picture provided by his sister, he can be seen kneeling graveside, with a garland of flowers he was given upon release draped over the headstone.</p>

<p>Announcing her decision to free him, Judge Kirstin Hamman ruled new evidence, including DNA test results, would likely change the outcome of another trial.</p><p>Maui County Prosecuting Attorney Andrew Martin said he plans to appeal against the decision and seek to have bail imposed on Mr Cordeiro's release.</p><p>Mr Cordeiro's first trial ended in a hung jury, with only one juror voting to convict him.</p><p>But he was later found guilty of murder, robbery and attempted murder and sentenced to life without the possibility of parole.</p>

<p>While I’m usually blogging about triathlon, today I want to discuss one of my other hobbies, scuba diving. Diving in the UK usually requires diving in a dry suit (not always, but trust me, it’s a LOT more comfortable). One of the biggest concerns that many have is about how to deal with the bladder situation. My good friend <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.facebook.com/DavidCAllen1979" target="_blank">Dave Allen</a> and I, get approached often about diving with a pee valve. Dave is a dive instructor with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://rec2tecdiving.co.uk/" target="_blank">Rec2Tec</a> and we’ve co-authored this topic, you can head over <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://rec2tecdiving.co.uk/fluid-dynamics/" target="_blank">here</a> to see how the boys do it….</p>



<p>I’ve been scuba diving for over 25 years, mostly in wetsuits or semi-dry suits. Back in the 90s, my first introduction to a dry suit involved VERY cold water. In fact, it was an ice dive. Since then, I’ve dove in various places: cold water, dark water, deep dives…but chose locations that were a bit more tropical or avoided winter diving, using wetsuits or even a semi-dry suit. In a wetsuit, when you have to pee, the solution is easy… you just go. In a dry suit, not so much. Back in the 90’s there wasn’t a convenient solution for women using dry suits, except for holding it and dehydrating yourself in hopes you could complete a dive without peeing yourself.</p>



<p>For some years there were some solutions for men (a zip at the front of the dry suit) or even just an external catheter system. For women though, there had been a major gap in the market. It was in 2015 that I learned about the ability to install a P-valve for women. I turned my ‘never again’ approach into ‘okay, let’s try this!’</p>



<p>I just want to start off and say, I have a bladder the size of a walnut. More than that, I drink A LOT of water and I have had some surgeries on my girl parts, so I do not have a bladder made of steel (although, I envy people that do). Cold water accelerates that for me, so I have to pee even more.</p>



<p>On most recreational dives I’m okay without a pee valve (anything under and hour). I am, admittedly, usually the first person to head to the toilets (or head) when exiting the water. UK diving really requires a dry suit and in 2015, I went to the dive show and got fitted for my new dry suit and pee valve. I was soooo excited. But… I was not sure how to use it, or really anything about peeing in dry suit. I did a lot of research, had some ‘interesting’ trial and error moments, so I thought I share this with you in hopes that it helps not only educate you on how to use a p-valve, but also helps you decide which path to take.</p>



<h2><strong>Why the p-valve?</strong></h2>



<p>For those of you asking, what are my options for diving in a dry suit? Well… you can just hold it (again, if you have a bladder of steel), nappies/diapers, the p-valve, or just pee in the suit (which is gross and defeats the whole purpose of the dry suit, right?). I am personally not inclined to use a diaper, the thought of sitting in my own urine does not appeal to me. Also, they leak. Again, not appealing. I have done too many dives where I’m sprinting for the toilets post-dive (usually ripping a wrist seal), not being able to get out of my suit fast enough.</p>



<p>When I am diving in a dry suit I intake much less water than I normally would, this isn’t healthy as it can lead to DCI (decompression sickness, etc). Hydration is important when diving repetitive dives and I also have a bit of anxiety as well about having to pee on a dive. I don’t know about you, but when I have to pee, it really distracted me on my dives and getting into more technical diving, this was not ideal. I needed a solution that eased my mind and my bladder.</p>



<p>So…enter in the P-valve.</p>



<p>The P-valve (in theory) allows you to dive without a diaper, eliminates bladder discomfort by enabling a person to glue (yes, glue – we’ll come to that in a minute) an external catheter to their lady parts, hooked into a tube that exits out the dry suit leg using a one-way valve. It’s a pretty awesome invention, but it’s not quite as simple as ‘plug it in and go’.</p>



<h2><strong>Which p-valve/catheter system should I buy?</strong></h2>



<p>If you don’t have a P-valve installed in your dry suit, you can have one installed at any time by the manufacturer or a local professional. While in theory you can do it yourself, I highly recommend allowing an experienced professional to install the valve itself to avoid leaking. I personally had mine installed at the time of ordering my Hollis dry suit, they used a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.sitech.se/home.aspx" target="_blank">SI TECH one-way valve</a>. At the time of writing this I have an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.othree.co.uk/" target="_blank">O3 custom dry suit</a> on order and they use <a href="https://www.othree.co.uk/apv-care-maintenance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">their own custom valv</a>e. Regardless of the brand, get the one-way P-valve installed in your suit.</p>

<p>There are various options for external catheters for ladies on the market today. The one that I found that got the best reviews (and seemed the most logical for me) is the <a href="https://www.she-p.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">She-P system.</a> The She-P system is made from silicone and each one is made by hand and of fantastic quality.</p>



<p>At the time of purchase the She-P Classic was the one recommended. I bought the whole kit for it, which includes medical grade adhesive, removal wipes and the tubing required to attach it to the P-valve in my dry suit. You can find the classic version <a href="https://www.she-p.com/product/ready-to-pee-kit-with-she-p-classic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>



<p>I would honestly consider the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.she-p.com/product/ready-to-pee-kit-with_she-p_3-0/" target="_blank">She-P version 3.0</a>. This will be my next upgrade soon. I explain why down below.</p>



<h2><strong>Preparing for the She-P</strong></h2>



<p>This is the area that where I had the most questions (and also, where most people ask me how this whole thing works). This article can be a delicate subject (no pun intended!), so let’s talk about the configuration of the She-P itself:</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="717" data-permalink="https://peeifyouwanttogofaster.com/imagegen/" data-orig-file="https://peeifyouwanttogofaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/imagegen.jpg" data-orig-size="573,382" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="imagegen" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://peeifyouwanttogofaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/imagegen.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://peeifyouwanttogofaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/imagegen.jpg?w=573" loading="lazy" width="573" height="382" src="https://peeifyouwanttogofaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/imagegen.jpg?w=573" alt="" srcset="https://peeifyouwanttogofaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/imagegen.jpg 573w, https://peeifyouwanttogofaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/imagegen.jpg?w=150 150w, https://peeifyouwanttogofaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/imagegen.jpg?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 573px) 100vw, 573px"><figcaption>She-P Classic</figcaption></figure></div>

<p>The She-P needs to adhere from the perineum to the front of you, with the tube sticking out the front. Keep this in mind when reading the below in terms of which area to prep.</p>



<p>Whether you’re using the She-P Classic or She-P 3.0 the preparation for attachment is the same.</p>



<ul><li>Remove the hair from your lady parts. I recommend shaving, waxing or laser hair removal. Shaving can cause irritation, if that is the case, look into waxing or laser. You don’t want to irritate the skin as you’re about to put some glue onto it. How much hair to remove? Think Brazilian, you need to clear the hair from the perineum to the front of your pubic bone. <em>You can attach the device with stubble, but it does not make for a pleasant removal experience, and could potentially cause a leak when in use.</em></li></ul>



<ul><li>My advice, just go bald down there ladies…. I personally went with laser hair removal years ago and that’s paying off tenfold now.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Make sure there are not any moisturizers or oil on your skin. Taking a shower on the morning when you’re going to attach the device is recommended. Use a non-oily soap to make sure the glue can adhere to your skin.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Attaching the She-P</strong></p>



<p>The first time you attach She-P I recommend that you have someone witness attaching it, it provides a great amount of humor. It wasn’t my first time, but I was still experimenting with my device, and I was with my friend Sandi, she wanted to see how I did it in person. So, in the middle of the car park at Stoney Cove, we attempted to attach the catheter in the middle of December. Not only was it cold out, but we couldn’t stop laughing. Definitely ensure your first attempt is at home and test it in the shower.</p>



<p>To ready the device to be attached, I do honestly recommend a mirror setup below you to see where you are attaching it, else you’ll end up like me, thinking you glued your butthole (true story). Since there is glue involved, I would highly recommend a pair of gloves to keep your hands from getting glue on them.</p>



<ul><li>Make sure the device itself is clean, remember where you’re attaching it to.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Get out the glue for the device. The She-P kit I purchased comes with Hollister medical spray glue or you can use Urobond. As I’m not coordinated enough to use the little brush with the Urobond, I highly recommend the Hollister spray. As you’ll be spraying the She-P, I recommend placing the catheter on something that can be discarded (paper towel, piece of paper or parchment paper), but be careful not to glue the device to anything.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Apply TWO layers of glue to the She-P. Spray the first layer of glue onto the outer flaps, avoiding the reservoir. I like to keep the glue towards the outside of the flaps, avoiding the very inner area by the reservoir (remember, this is medical grade glue, you don’t want to glue your lips together – or anything else that is down there). I’ve highlighted in red the area I aim to spray with the glue.</li></ul>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="723" data-permalink="https://peeifyouwanttogofaster.com/she-p_img1/" data-orig-file="https://peeifyouwanttogofaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/she-p_img1.jpg" data-orig-size="441,442" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="she-p_img1" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://peeifyouwanttogofaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/she-p_img1.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://peeifyouwanttogofaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/she-p_img1.jpg?w=441" loading="lazy" width="441" height="442" src="https://peeifyouwanttogofaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/she-p_img1.jpg?w=441" alt="" srcset="https://peeifyouwanttogofaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/she-p_img1.jpg 441w, https://peeifyouwanttogofaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/she-p_img1.jpg?w=150 150w, https://peeifyouwanttogofaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/she-p_img1.jpg?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 441px) 100vw, 441px"><figcaption>Spray coverage on the She-P</figcaption></figure></div>



<ul><li>Apply your first layer of glue onto the device, allow to dry for a few minutes (this is a good time to go have a cup of coffee – because you can!). I have heard others doing the first layer the night before, just make sure you don’t knock the device, get fluff on it, or some other disaster before the morning – hence why I do mine in the morning.</li></ul>



<ul><li>After about 10 minutes I apply the second layer of glue, allowing that to dry to just where if you touch the glue at the slightest, it’s almost thick and sticky. Now, you’re ready to adhere it to you. Note: you can use one layer of glue if you’re only doing one dive, but I don’t find it adheres well enough for me.</li></ul>



<ul><li>This is the fun part… Stand over your mirror or bring a friend. Line up the reservoir under you, meaning, aligned under your urethra (if you don’t know where that is, it’s where the urine comes out), with the hose pointing forward and press on from the front over the lips, then onto the sides and pressing through to the perineum. I personally have cyclists’ thighs, so I make sure just to have my legs open a bit and ensure the catheter is glued to the sides of my undercarriage. Note: You want to avoid getting glue onto your thighs (as I have done) and get a pretty good seal.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Press the catheter onto you, don’t squat or go for a run. Press the device on and keep some pressure on it. If I let go, I find the catheter drops a bit from the weight of it…don’t do that. The weight of the tube will pull it down, hold it up so the seal doesn’t break or pull the skin (yes, it’s uncomfortable). Ensure the seal is glued on, for myself I find the area by the perineum to be the most difficult. I then don some spandex shorts over top. For me personally, this applies some pressure to the device, holds the tube up and keeps everything in place.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Once the device is in place, I HIGHLY suggest going for a test pee. The first time you do this, get in the tub or shower. Trust me. While standing, do a SLOW pee, like VERY VERY SLOW pee, remember, that little reservoir is catching the urine and going down the tube, which can be a bit of a bottleneck. If you’ve never peed standing up as a female, it’s a very novel experience. I giggled continuously, until I realized it was like a firehose and I peed everywhere. Learn to aim.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Since I’ve used the She-P a few times now, I ensure I pee as much as possible before attaching the device. I then pee before my dive in the toilets or before boarding the boat. Finding the right position to pee standing up is difficult. As mentioned, I find the point of attachment to the perineum the point of leaking for me. Others have found the front to be an issue. When I’m using a toilet with the She-P attached I find I have to face the toilet when standing, bend at the waist and allow the urine to go down the tube. Think of an awkward squat but facing forwards, pushing the hose towards the toilet bowl. I have tried standing in various positions to pee, and that is what works for me. Since you’re not using the device much on dry land this shouldn’t be your focus, but I find a test pee a good way of checking for leaks.</li></ul>



<ul><li>There are various ways to ensure the device gets some extra security in place. I personally, use a pair of tight spandex shorts. I also pull the front adapter up towards my belly button as that’s how I wear it in my suit (will explain that below). Many people have tried various ways to give the catheter extra security:<ul><li>Two thongs – one over each leg, holding the She-P in place on the inner thigh. For me, this didn’t work, it was too restrictive, but go ahead and give it a shot.</li></ul><ul><li>Rubber/latex underwear – Some women swear by this. I searched for rubber/latex underwear, which brings up some interesting results on the internet. I did acquire a pair and when trying them, they were soooo uncomfortable and shifted a bit. I’ve tossed that idea out, but again, it may work for you.</li></ul><ul><li>Nappies/Diapers/sanitary pads – Some women will still wear a nappy/diaper to catch any drippage. I have a severe aversion to this…I’d risk the leak. You can also use a good sanitary pad in your underwear, probably the better option.</li></ul><ul><li>Waterproof medical tape – put this in your kit bag. If you find a leak on your trial pee, you can add some tape over the leaking area (see, this is why you want to get rid of all of your hair).</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>I hate to say it, but this is all going to be trial and error. The best part is, you can pee while diving and avoid the discomfort. The downside is that you might not make any friends if they know you’ve accidentally peed yourself. Try this all out in the shower the first time, and maybe use the pads/diapers on the first few dives until you’re comfortable.</p>



<h2><strong>Diving with the She-P</strong></h2>



<p>Once I get the She-P catheter attached I’m ready to go diving…woohoo!</p>



<p>Above I mentioned that I wear a pair of tight shorts, I take the hose and point it up towards my belly button. The shorts hold it in place and keep everything fairly pressed against the skin. I have tried pointing the catheter in a more downwards position, but I caused a kink in the hose, which caused a little backflow, so just try out what works best for you. I find sitting down with the catheter attached is interesting… i.e., driving in a car, sitting on a bench – heck, even walking, I feel a bit like a cowboy. It’s okay, it’s normal and as the day goes on, you get more comfortable with it.</p>



<p>When I’m getting dressed to dive, I have my shorts on, then I wear (sometimes) a thermal layer that goes on as normal. On top of that I wear my under suit. I currently have a<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://fourthelement.com/product-category/drysuit-underwear/arctic/" target="_blank"> Fourth Element Arctic two-piece suit.</a> If you’ve ever seen a mens under suit when using a P-valve, they have a hole cut for their hose down the leg. I cut along the front of my under suit and had some Velcro sewn either side of the crotch. This provides an easy way to attach my She-P to my P-valve.</p>



<p>When I get into my dry suit I take the tube from my p-valve, run it up through the Velcro hole in the front of my under suit, also running that straight up the front of me to the other end of the catheter. I have the quick connector system that came with my She-P kit, I can easily plug the two ends together and voila!</p>



<p>I am routing both tubes up towards my belly button, I create an ‘S’ or ‘C’ bend, in the tubes, without actually causing a kink, I use the shorts to hold the catheter in place and the tube routes down through my under suit. You will need to find the position of the tubing that works best for you. For me, I found that when I’m diving, this is absolute best position, it also means that pesky perineum area doesn’t leak.</p>



<p>I’m all plumbed in and ready to go!</p>



<p>For my specific P-valve, I find that I have to ensure it’s closed, or it leaks. Most valves don’t do that, but mine does (hopefully my new one won’t). Also, if you keep the valve closed, you can get a reverse pressure that you’ll feel in the chamber, so open and close the valve a bit to release that pressure (especially if you feel it when diving).</p>



<p>Peeing on the actual dive takes practice. I have devised a specific hand signal that I’ve used with various dive buddies to say, ‘I need to pee’. It usually creates a laugh, a bit of mask flooding, then they awkwardly stare at you when you’re trying to pee. Again, you’re going to need to practice peeing. Personally, I cannot be swimming and peeing. I have to stop kicking. I usually hang out on a wreck and do my thing, but I usually find a deco/safety stop is the best place. I mean, what else are you going to do? Like I mentioned before, I keep my valve closed. My buddy can see me reach for the valve to open it, so I don’t even need a hand signal…yeah, it’s about as subtle as a brick to the face…so they know… I’m peeing. They usually make faces at me and cause again, more laughter.</p>



<p>No matter where you choose to pee with your P-valve, PEE SLOWLY. The urine should exit down the tube and all is good. I would highly suggest having a pee before exiting the water (again, for me it’s on a deco stop). I stay plumbed in all day, I’m usually okay between dives, but if you find yourself on a long surface interval or stuck in your dry suit. Just go stand in a quiet corner, open your valve and pee standing up. All the boys do it!</p>



<h2><strong>Removing the She-P</strong></h2>



<p>When you’re done diving for the day, un-clasp your hose from the P-valve, FLUSH OUT your P-valve asap if you can. Use a bottle with a small nose to flush out the P-valve. I use Milton with water to flush down the tube to my suit (and don’t forget to open your valve on your leg). I then rinse thoroughly with water and blow into the end of the tube with my mouth to get the liquid out.</p>



<p>I use the cap that came with the kit and close off the hose on the catheter after I’ve taken off my suit for the day. If I have to travel home or somewhere in a car, I just leave my shorts on, and the catheter is still attached. I have removed the catheter in different ways, each with varying levels of success…</p>



<ul><li>Wait until you’re near a hot shower and gently peel (be careful to not rip the catheter) it off of you.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Peel back the catheter from your body and remove from wherever you are. I tend to go with this method, but I’ve had interesting results. One time I peeled it off too fast, my skin felt raw for a couple of days, and I spent the evening with an ice pack on my raw skin. Usually, I just get residual glue.</li></ul>



<ul><li>No matter how I remove the She-P I end of up with glue on it and myself. I use the wipes to get off the excess.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Wash the She-P with warm water and soap, wash the device all over and ensure that you run the soap/water through the hose. Hang the device up to dry, I have a little hook that I hang it from (with the hose pointing down, allowing it to drip dry).</li></ul>



<ul><li>If you’re diving for multiple days in a row, clean the device after each day (and yourself). Travel with whatever cleaning fluids that work and stick to those.</li></ul>



<ul><li>I’ve never taken off my She-P during a day of diving, I leave it on all day, but I’ve heard of people taking it off between dives. I would only recommend that if your dives are fairly far apart and you’re on a liveaboard. If you can survive with it on all day, that might be the easier option (if you’re not doing any other activities for the day).</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Diving while on your period</strong></h2>



<p>While I don’t want to go too deep on this topic, it will happen. Up until that last 2 years, I had been on birth control for 20 years, so if I had a trip coming up I could just skip my period using my birth control. Since then, I’ve opted to go off birth control (that’s a whole other story) and have had to face what to do with my period, diving and the P-valve. Firstly, it all depends on your flow, if you have a heavy period, a diaper/nappy might be best. Second, it depends on what you usually use on your period to deal with the flow. I personally, gave up tampons several years ago and dive with a menstrual cup. I made the change due to several factors: reusability, better for the environment, easier to manage, better for endurance sports (and diving). The only downside is that it pushes on my bladder when diving (just a bit, but it’s noticeable).</p>



<p>I tend to keep the menstrual cup in and attach my She-P as I normally would. I can leave the menstrual cup in for over 8 hours if needed, so this method works really really well for me. If your flow is really light, you could potentially get away with nothing at all, as the reservoir would catch it, you just want to make sure that it doesn’t ‘overload the system’.</p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>Diving with a She-P is awesome and a total game changer!&nbsp; I’ve tried to make this blog as comprehensive as possible to cover off my experience and others that have tried diving with a P-valve. &nbsp;As with anything, it all comes down to personal preference and a bit of trial and error.</p>



<p>Don’t let your bladder keep you from diving. There are several Facebook groups out there aimed at this, as well as Scubaboard.</p>



<p>Good luck and dive deep my friends! </p>
