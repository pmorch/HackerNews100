  <div><p><span data-contrast="none">The European Union’s new Digital Markets Act (DMA) is a complex, many-legged beast, but at root, it is a regulation that aims to make it easier for the public to control the technology they use and rely on.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="0}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">One DMA rule forces </span><span>the powerful “gatekeeper” </span><span data-contrast="none">tech companies to allow third-party app stores. That means that you, the owner of a device, can decide who you trust to provide you with software for it.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="0}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">There’s a rule banning “self-preferencing.” That’s when platforms push their often inferior, in-house products and hide superior products made by their rivals.</span><span data-ccp-props="0}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">And perhaps best of all, there’s a privacy rule, reinforcing the eight-year-old General Data Protection Regulation, a strong</span><span>,</span><span data-contrast="none"> privacy law that has been flouted</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="none"> for too long, </span><i><span data-contrast="none">especially </span></i><span data-contrast="none">by the largest tech giants.</span><span data-ccp-props="0}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">In other words, the DMA is meant to push us toward a world where you decide which software runs on your devices,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="none"> where it’s easy to find the best products and services, where you can leave a platform for a better one without forfeiting your social relationships</span> <span data-contrast="none">,</span> <span data-contrast="none">and where you can do all of this without getting spied on.</span><span data-ccp-props="0}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If it </span><span>works,</span> <span data-contrast="none">this will get dangerously close to </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/how-to-fix-the-internet-podcast"><span data-contrast="none">better future</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> we’ve spent the past thirty years fighting for.</span><span data-ccp-props="0}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">There’s just one wrinkle: the Big Tech companies don’t want that future, and they’re trying their damndest to strangle it in its cradle.</span><span data-ccp-props="0}"></span></p>

<p><span data-ccp-props="0}">&nbsp;Right from the start, it was obvious that the tech giants were going to war against the DMA, and the freedom it promised to their users. Take Apple, whose tight control over which software its customers can install was a major concern of the DMA from its inception.</span><span data-ccp-props="0}"> <br></span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Apple didn’t invent the idea of a “curated computer” that could only run software that was blessed by its manufacturer, but they certainly perfected it. iOS devices will refuse to run software unless it comes from Apple’s App Store, and that control over Apple’s customers means that Apple can exert tremendous control over app vendors, too.</span><span data-ccp-props="0}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;Apple charges app vendors a whopping 30 percent commission on most transactions, both the initial price of the app and everything you buy from it thereafter. This is a remarkably high transaction fee —compare it to the credit-card sector, itself the subject of sharp criticism for its high </span><i><span data-contrast="none">3-5</span></i><span data-contrast="none"> percent fees. To maintain those high commissions, Apple also restricts its vendors from informing their customers about the existence of other ways of paying (say, via their website) and at various times has also banned its vendors from offering discounts to customers who complete their purchases without using the app.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="0}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{}">Apple is adamant that it needs this control to keep its customers safe, but </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/document/letter-bruce-schneier-senate-judiciary-regarding-app-store-security"><span data-contrast="none">in theory</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> and </span><a href="https://gizmodo.com/apple-iphone-analytics-tracking-even-when-off-app-store-1849757558"><span data-contrast="none">in practice</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, Apple has shown that </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/document/letter-bruce-schneier-senate-judiciary-regarding-app-store-security"><span data-contrast="none">it can protect you without maintaining this degree of control</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, and that </span><a href="https://gizmodo.com/apple-iphone-analytics-tracking-even-when-off-app-store-1849757558"><span data-contrast="none">it uses this control to </span><i><span data-contrast="none">take away</span></i><span data-contrast="none"> your security when it serves the company’s profits to do so</span></a><span data-contrast="none">.</span><span data-ccp-props="0}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{}">Apple </span><a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/apple/marketcap/"><span data-contrast="none">is worth between two and three trillion dollars</span></a><span data-contrast="none">. Investors prize Apple’s stock in large part due to </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/18/opinion/apple-google-app-monopoly.html"><span data-contrast="none">the tens of billions of dollars it extracts from other businesses</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> that want to reach its customers.</span><span data-ccp-props="0}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">The DMA is aimed squarely at these practices. It requires the largest app store companies to grant their customers the freedom to choose other app stores. Companies like Apple were given over a year to prepare for the DMA, and were told to produce compliance plans by March of this year.</span><span data-ccp-props="0}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">But </span><a href="https://proton.me/blog/apple-dma-compliance-plan-trap"><span data-contrast="none">Apple’s compliance plan falls </span><i><span data-contrast="none">very</span></i><span data-contrast="none"> short of the mark</span></a><span data-contrast="none">: between a blizzard of confusing junk fees (like the €0.50 per use “Core Technology Fee” that the most popular apps will have to pay Apple even if their apps are sold through a rival store) and onerous conditions (app makers who try </span><span>to sell through </span><span data-contrast="none">a rival app store </span><span>are </span><span>have their offerings </span><span data-contrast="none">removed from Apple’s store, and are permanently&nbsp;</span><span> banned </span><span data-contrast="none">from it), the plan in no way satisfies the EU’s goal of fostering competition in app stores.</span><span data-ccp-props="0}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">That’s just scratching the surface of Apple’s absurd proposal: Apple’s customers will have to successfully navigate a maze of deeply buried settings just to try another app store (</span><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/04/01/altstore-iphone-apps-patreon-eu/"><span data-contrast="none">and there’s some pretty cool-sounding app stores in the wings</span></a><span data-contrast="none">!), and </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/7/24093437/apple-iphone-third-party-app-store-dma-eu"><span data-contrast="none">Apple will disable all your third-party apps if you take your phone out of the EU for 30 days</span></a><span data-contrast="none">.</span><span data-ccp-props="0}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Apple appears to be playing a high-stakes game of chicken with EU regulators, effectively saying, “Yes, you have 500 million citizens, but we have three trillion dollars, so why should we listen to you?” Apple inaugurated this performance of noncompliance by banning Epic, the company most closely associated with the EU’s decision to require third party app stores, from operating an app store and terminating its developer account (</span><a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/apple-terminated-epic-s-developer-account"><span data-contrast="none">Epic’s account was later reinstated</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> after the EU registered its disapproval).</span><span data-ccp-props="0}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">It’s not just Apple, of course.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="0}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">The DMA includes new enforcement tools to finally apply the General Data Privacy Regulation (GDPR) to US tech giants. The GDPR is Europe’s landmark privacy law, but in the eight years since its passage, Europeans have struggled to use it to reform the terrible privacy practices of the largest tech companies.</span><span data-ccp-props="0}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Meta is one of the worst on privacy, and no wonder: its entire business is grounded in the nonconsensual extraction and mining of billions of dollars’ worth of private information from billions of people all over the world. The GDPR should be requiring Meta to actually secure our willing, informed (and revocable) consent to carry on all this surveillance, and there’s </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/02/facebook-says-apple-ios-privacy-change-will-cost-10-billion-this-year.html"><span data-contrast="none">good evidence that more than 95 percent of us would block Facebook spying if we could</span></a><span data-contrast="none">.</span><span data-ccp-props="0}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Meta’s answer to this is a “</span><a href="https://noyb.eu/en/pay-or-okay-1500-eu-year-your-online-privacy"><span data-contrast="none">Pay or Okay</span></a><span data-contrast="none">” system, in which users who do not consent to Meta’s surveillance will have to pay to use the service, or be blocked from it. Unfortunately for Meta, this is prohibited (privacy is not a luxury good that only the wealthiest should be afforded).&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="0}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Just like Apple, Meta is behaving as though the DMA permits it to carry on its worst behavior, with minor cosmetic tweaks around the margins. Just like Apple, Meta is daring the EU to enforce its democratically enacted laws, implicitly promising to pit its billions against Europe’s institutions to preserve its right to spy on us.</span><span data-ccp-props="0}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">These are high-stakes clashes. </span><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6fb1602d-a08b-4a8c-bac0-047b7d64aba5"><span data-contrast="none">As the tech sector grew more concentrated, it also grew less accountable</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, able to substitute lock-in and regulatory capture for making good products and </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/wp/who-has-your-back-2019"><span data-contrast="none">having their users’ backs</span></a><span data-contrast="none">. Tech has found new ways to compromise our </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/privacy"><span data-contrast="none">privacy rights</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, our </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/tech-rights-are-workers-rights-doordash-edition"><span data-contrast="none">labor rights</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, and our </span><a href="https://scholarship.law.bu.edu/faculty_scholarship/3645/"><span data-contrast="none">consumer rights</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> - at scale.</span><span data-ccp-props="0}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{}">After decades of regulatory indifference to tech monopolization, competition authorities all over the world are taking on Big Tech. The DMA is by far the most muscular and ambitious salvo we’ve seen.</span><span data-ccp-props="0}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{}">Seen in that light, it’s no surprise that Big Tech is refusing to comply with the rules. If the EU successfully forces tech to play fair, it will serve as a starting gun for a global race to the top, in which tech’s ill-gotten gains - of data, power and money - will be returned to the users and workers from whom that treasure came.</span><span data-ccp-props="0}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{}">The architects of the DMA and DSA foresaw this, of course. </span><a href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/blog/eu-opens-dma-investigations/"><span data-contrast="none">They’ve announced investigations into Apple, Google and Meta</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, threatening </span><a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/european-commission-antitrust-investigation-apple-meta-alphabet/"><span data-contrast="none">fines of 10 percent of the companies’ global income, which will </span><i><span data-contrast="none">double</span></i><span data-contrast="none"> to 20 percent</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> if the companies don’t toe the line.</span><span data-ccp-props="0}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">It’s not just Big Tech that’s playing for all the marbles - it’s also the systems of democratic control and accountability. If Apple can sabotage the DMA’s insistence on taking away its veto over its customers’ software choices, that will spill over into </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1344546/dl?inline"><span data-contrast="none">the US Department of Justice’s case over the same issue</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, as well as the cases in </span><a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Japan-to-crack-down-on-Apple-and-Google-app-store-monopolies"><span data-contrast="none">Japan</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> and </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/skorea-considers-505-mln-fine-against-google-apple-over-app-market-practices-2023-10-06/"><span data-contrast="none">South Korea</span></a><span data-contrast="none">, and the </span><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-wins-appeal-in-apple-case"><span data-contrast="none">pending enforcement action in the UK</span></a><span data-contrast="none">.</span><span data-ccp-props="0}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Sometimes success smacks you right in the face. More often, it sneaks up on you from behind.</p>
<p>In September of 1993, <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2016/10/the-manhole">the brothers Rand and Robyn Miller</a> and the few other employees of Cyan, Inc., were prototypical starving artists, living on “rice and beans and government cheese.” That month they saw Brøderbund publish their esoteric Apple Macintosh puzzle game <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2020/02/myst-or-the-drawbacks-to-success"><em>Myst</em></a>, which they and everyone else regarded as a niche product for a niche platform. There would go another year before it became abundantly clear that <em>Myst</em>, now available in a version for Microsoft Windows as well as for the Mac, was a genuine mass-market hit. It would turn into the gift that kept on giving, a game with more legs than your average millipede. It wouldn’t enjoy its best single month until December of 1996, when it would set a record for the most copies one game had <em>ever</em> sold in one month.</p>
<p>All of this — not just the sales figures themselves but the dozens of awards, the write-ups in glossy magazines like <em>Rolling Stone</em> and <em>Newsweek</em>, the fawningly overwritten profiles in <em>Wired</em>, the comparisons with Steven Spielberg’s <em>Jurassic Park</em> and Michael Jackson’s <em>Thriller</em> — happened just gradually enough that it seemed almost natural. <em>Almost</em> natural. “It took a while for it to hit me that millions of people were buying this game,” says Robyn Miller. “The most I could really wrap my head around would be to go to a huge concert and see all of the people there and think, ‘Okay, this is not even a portion of the people who are playing <em>Myst</em>.'”</p>
<p>The Miller brothers could have retired and lived very comfortably for the rest of their lives on the fortune they earned from <em>Myst</em>. They didn’t choose this path. “We took salaries that were fairly modest and just put the company’s money back into [a] new project,” says Rand.</p>
<p>Brøderbund was more than eager for a sequel to <em>Myst</em>, something that many far smaller hits than it got as a matter of course within a year. But the Miller brothers refused to be hurried, and did not need to be, a rare luxury indeed in their industry. Although they enjoyed a very good relationship with Brøderbund, whose marketing acumen had been essential to getting the <em>Myst</em> ball rolling, they did not wish to be beholden to their publisher in any way. Rather than accepting the traditional publisher advance, they decided that they would fund the sequel entirely on their own out of the royalties of the first game. This meant that, as <em>Myst</em> blew up bigger and bigger, their ambitions for the game they intended to call <em>Riven</em> were inflated in tandem. They refused to give Brøderbund a firm release date; it will be done when it’s done, they said. They took to talking about <em>Myst</em> as their <em>Hobbit</em>, <em>Riven</em> as their <em>Lord of the Rings</em>. It had taken J.R.R. Tolkien seventeen years to bridge the gap between his children’s adventure story and the most important fantasy epic in modern literary history. Surely Brøderbund could accept having to wait just a few years for <em>Riven</em>, especially with the sales figures <em>Myst</em> was still putting up.</p>
<p>Cyan’s digs reflected their rising status. They hadn’t even had a proper office when they were making <em>Myst</em>; everybody worked out of their separate homes in and around Spokane, Washington, sharing their output with one another using the “car net”: put it on a disk, get into your car, and drive it over to the other person. In the immediate aftermath of <em>Myst’</em>s release and promising early sales, they all piled into a drafty, unheated garage owned by their sound specialist Chris Brandkamp. Then, as the sales numbers continued to tick upward, they moved into an anonymous-looking former Comfort World Mattress storefront. Finally, in January of 1995, they broke ground on a grandiosely named “Cyan World Headquarters,” whose real-world architecture was to be modeled on the virtual architecture of <em>Myst</em> and <em>Riven</em>. While they were waiting for that building to be completed — the construction would take eighteen months — they junked the consumer-grade Macs which had slowly and laboriously done all of the 3D modeling necessary to create <em>Myst’</em>s environments in favor of Silicon Graphics workstations that cost $40,000 a pop.</p>

<hr>

<p>There were attempts to drum up controversies in the press, especially after <em>Riven</em> missed a tentative Christmas 1996 target date which Brøderbund had (prematurely) announced, a delay that caused the publisher’s stock price to drop by 25 percent. The journalists who always seemed to be hovering around the perimeter of Cyan’s offices claimed to sniff trouble in the air, an aroma of overstretched budgets and creative tensions. But, although there were certainly arguments — what project of this magnitude doesn’t cause arguments? — there was in truth no juicy decadence or discord going on at Cyan. The Miller brothers, sons of a preacher and still devout Christians, never lost their Heartland groundedness. They never let their fluke success go to their heads in the way of, say, the minds behind <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2020/04/the-7th-guests-new-clothes">Trilobyte of <em>The 7th Guest</em> fame</a>, were never even seriously tempted to move their operation to some more glamorous city than Spokane. For them, it was all about the work. And luckily for them, plenty of people were more than willing to move to Spokane for a chance to work at The House That <em>Myst</em> Built, which by the end of 1995 had replaced Trilobyte as the most feted single games studio in the mainstream American press, the necessary contrast to all those other unscrupulous operators who were <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2021/04/the-ratings-game-part-1-a-likely-and-an-unlikely-suspect">filling their games and the minds of the nation’s youth with indiscriminate sex and violence</a>.</p>
<p>The most important of all the people who were suddenly willing to come to Spokane would prove to be Richard Vander Wende, a former Disney production designer — his fingerprints were all over the recent film <em>Aladdin</em> — who first bumped into the Miller brothers at a Digital World Expo in Los Angeles. Wende’s conceptual contribution to <em>Riven</em> would be as massive as that of either of the Miller brothers, such that he would be given a richly deserved co-equal billing with them at the very top of the credits listing.</p>

<p>Needless to say, though, there were many others who contributed as well. By the time Cyan moved into their new world headquarters in the summer of 1996, more than twenty people were actively working on <em>Riven</em> every day. The sequel would wind up costing ten times to fifteen times as much to make as its predecessor, filling five CDs to <em>Myst’</em>s lone silver platter.</p>
<p>Given the Millers’ artistic temperament and given the rare privilege they enjoyed of being able to make exactly the game they wished to make, one might be tempted to assume that <em>Riven</em> was to be some radical departure from what had come before. In reality, though, this was not the case at all. <em>Riven</em> was to be <em>Myst</em>, only more so; call it <em>Myst</em> perfected. Once again you would be left to wander around inside a beautiful pre-rendered 3D environment, which you would view from a first-person perspective. And once again you would be expected to solve intricate puzzles there — or not, as you chose.</p>
<p>Cyan had long since realized that players of <em>Myst</em> broke down into two broad categories. There were those they called the gamers, who engaged seriously with it as a series of logical challenges to be overcome through research, experimentation, and deduction. And then there was the other group of players — a far, far larger one, if we’re being honest — whom Cyan called the tourists, who just wanted to poke around a little inside the virtual world and take in some of the sights and sounds. These were folks like the residents of a retirement home who wrote to Cyan to say that they had been playing and enjoying <em>Myst</em> for two years and two months, and wanted to hear if the rumors that there were locations to explore beyond the first island — an island which constitutes about 20 percent of the full game — were in fact true.</p>
<p><em>Riven</em> was meant to cater to both groups, by giving the gamers a much deeper, richer, more complex tapestry of puzzles to unravel, whilst simultaneously being kept as deliberately “open” as possible in terms of its geography, so that you could see most of its locations without ever having to solve a single conundrum. “The two complaints about <em>Myst</em>,” said Rand Miller, “were that it was too hard and too easy. We’re trying to make <em>Riven</em> better for both kinds of players.” Whereas <em>Myst</em> allowed you to visit four separate “ages” — basically, alternative dimensions — after solving those early puzzles which had so stymied the retirees, <em>Riven</em> was to take place all in the same dimension, on a single archipelago of five islands. You would be able to travel between the islands right from the start, using vehicles whose operation should be quite straightforward even for the most puzzle-averse players. If all you wanted to do was wander around the world of <em>Riven</em>, it would give you a lot more spaces in which to do so than <em>Myst</em>.</p>
<p>Of course, while the world of <em>Riven</em> was slowly coming together, the real world wasn’t sitting still. <em>Myst</em> had been followed by an inevitable flood of “<em>Myst</em> clones” from other publishers and studios, which, in lieu of a proper sequel from Cyan, did their best to pick up the slack by offering up their own deserted, 3D-rendered environments to explore. Few of them were more than modestly successful; <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/560/zork-nemesis-the-forbidden-lands/">Activision’s <em>Zork Nemesis</em></a>, which may have done the best of them all, sold about 450,000 copies, an order of magnitude and a half less than the final numbers that <em>Myst</em> would put up. Meanwhile the genre of adventure games in general had peaked in the immediate aftermath of <em>Myst</em> and would be well into an increasingly precipitous decline by the time <em>Riven</em> shipped in October of 1997. <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2023/10/the-last-express"><em>The Last Express</em></a>, the only other adventure that Brøderbund published that year, stiffed badly in the spring, despite sporting prominently on its box the name of <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2016/10/how-jordan-mechner-made-a-different-sort-of-interactive-movie-or-the-virtues-of-restraint">Jordan Mechner</a>, one of the few videogame auteurs with a reputation to rival that of the Miller brothers.</p>
<p>Yet Cyan’s own games still seemed weirdly proof against the marketplace pressures that were driving so many other game makers in the direction of real-time strategy and first-person shooters. In June of 1997, the nearly four-year-old <em>Myst</em> was propelled back to the top of the sales charts by the excitement over the approaching debut of <em>Riven</em>. And when it did appear, <em>Riven</em> didn’t disappoint the bean counters. It and <em>Myst</em> tag-teamed one another in the top two chart positions right through the Christmas buying season. <em>Myst</em> would return to number one a few more times in the course of 1998, while an entire industry continued to scratch its collective head, wondering why this particular game — a game that was now approaching its fifth birthday, making it roughly as aged as the plays of Shakespeare as the industry reckoned time — should continue to sell in such numbers. Even today, it’s hard to say precisely why <em>Myst</em> just kept selling and selling, defying all the usual gravities of its market. It seems that non-violent, non-hardcore gaming simply needed a standard bearer, and so it found one for itself.</p>
<p><em>Riven</em> wasn’t quite as successful as <em>Myst</em>, but this doesn’t mean it didn’t do very well indeed by all of the standard metrics. Its biggest failing in comparison to its older sibling was ironically its very cutting-edge nature; whereas just about any computer that was capable of running other everyday software could run <em>Myst</em> by 1997, you needed a fairly recent, powerful machine to run <em>Riven</em>. Despite this, and despite the usual skepticism from the hardcore-gaming press — “With its familiar, lever-yanking gameplay, <em>Riven</em> emerges as the ultimate <em>Myst</em> clone,” scoffed <em>Computer Gaming World</em> magazine — <em>Riven’</em>s sales surpassed 1 million units in its first year, numbers of which any other adventure game could scarcely have dreamed.<span><a role="button" tabindex="0" onclick="footnote_moveToReference_5916_1('footnote_plugin_reference_5916_1_1');" onkeypress="footnote_moveToReference_5916_1('footnote_plugin_reference_5916_1_1');"><sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_5916_1_1">[1]</sup></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_5916_1_1">An article in the May 17 2001 edition of the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> claimed that <em>Riven</em> had sold 4.5 million copies by that point, three and a half years after its release. This number has since been repeated in numerous places, including Wikipedia. I’ll eat my hat if it’s correct; this game would have left a much wider vapor trail behind it if it was. Read in context in the original article, the figure actually comes across as a typo.<p>
<em>Riven</em> was a huge hit by any conventional standard, but it didn’t have the legs of <em>Myst</em>. Already for long stretches during 1998, it was once again being comfortably outsold by <em>Myst</em>. Lifetime retail sales of around 1.5 million strike me as the most likely figure — still more than enough to place <em>Riven</em> in the upper echelon of late 1990s computer games.</p></span></span></p>
<p>Fans and boosters of the genre naturally wanted to see a broader trend in <em>Riven’</em>s sales, a proof that adventures in general could still bring home the bacon with the best of them. The hard truth that the games of Cyan were always uniquely uncoupled from what was going on around them was never harder to accept than in this case. In the end, though, <em>Riven</em> would have no impact whatsoever on the overall trajectory of the adventure genre.</p>

<p>Because <em>Riven</em> is a sequel in such a pure sense — a game that aims to do exactly what its predecessor did, only bigger and better — your reaction to it is doomed to be dictated to a large extent by your reaction to said predecessor. It’s almost impossible for me to imagine anyone liking or loving <em>Riven</em> who didn’t at least like <em>Myst</em>.</p>
<p>The defining quality of both games is their thoroughgoing sense of restraint. When <em>Myst</em> first started to attract sales and attention, naysayers saw its minimalism through the lens of technical affordance, or rather the Miller brothers’ lack thereof: having only off-the-shelf middleware like <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2016/09/the-freedom-to-associate">HyperCard</a> to work with, lacking the skill set that might have let them create better tools of their own, they just had to do the best they could with what they had. In this reading, <em>Myst</em>‘s static world, its almost nonexistent user interface, its lack of even such niceties as a player inventory, stemmed not so much from aesthetic intent as from the fact that it had been created with a hypertext editor that had never been meant for making games. The alternative reading is that the Miller brothers were among the few game developers who knew the value of restraint from the start, that they were by nature and inclination minimalists in an industry inclined to maximalism in all things, and this quality was their greatest strength rather than a weakness. The truth probably lies somewhere between the two extremes, as it usually does. Regardless, there’s no denying that the brothers leaned hard into the same spirit of minimalism that had defined <em>Myst </em>when the time came to make <em>Riven</em>, even though they were now no longer technologically constrained into doing so. One camp reads this as a colossal failure of vision; the other reads it as merely staying true to the unique vision that had gotten them this far.</p>
<p>While I don’t want to plant myself too firmly in either corner, I must say that I am surprised by some of the things that Cyan <em>didn’t</em> do with twice the time and ten or fifteen times the budget. The fact that <em>Riven</em> still relies on static, pre-rendered scenery and node-based movement isn’t the source of my surprise; that compromise was necessary in order to achieve the visual fidelity that Cyan demanded. I’m rather surprised by how little Cyan innovated even within that basic framework. Well before <em>Riven</em> appeared, the makers of other <em>Myst</em> successors had begun to experiment with ways of creating a slightly more fluid, natural-feeling experience. <em>Zork Nemesis</em>, for example, stores each of its nodes as a 360-degree panorama instead of a set of fixed views, letting you smoothly turn in place through a complete circle. <em>Riven</em>, by contrast, confines its innovations in this area to displaying a little transition animation as you rotate between its rigidly fixed views. As a result, switching from view to view does become a little less jarring than it is in <em>Myst</em>, but the approach is far from even the <em>Myst</em>-clone state of the art.</p>
<p>Cyan was likewise disinterested in pursuing other solutions that would have been even easier to implement than panning rotation, but that could have made their game less awkward to play. The extent of your rotation when you click on the left or right side of the screen remains inconsistent, just as it was in <em>Myst</em>; sometimes it’s 90 degrees, sometimes it’s less or more. This can make simple navigation much more confusing than it needs to be, introducing a layer of fake difficulty — i.e., difficulties that you would <em>not</em> have if you were really <em>in</em> this world — which seems at odd with Cyan’s stated determination to create as immersive an experience as possible. Even a compass with which to tell which way you’re facing at any given time would have helped enormously, but no such concessions to player convenience are to hand.</p>
<p>Again, these are solutions that the other makers of <em>Myst</em> clones — not a group overly celebrated for its spirit of innovation — had long since deployed. Cyan was always a strangely self-contained entity, showing little awareness of what others were doing around them, making a virtue of their complete ignorance of the competition. In cases like these, it was perhaps not so much a virtue as a failure of simple due diligence. Building upon the work of others is the way that gaming as a whole progresses.</p>
<p>When it comes to storytelling as well, <em>Riven’</em>s differences from <em>Myst</em> are more a matter of execution than kind. As in <em>Myst</em>, there is very little story at all here, if by that we mean a foreground plot driving things along. A brief bit of exposition at the beginning picks up right where <em>Myst</em> ended, providing an excuse for dumping you into another open-ended environment. Whereas <em>Myst</em> took place entirely in deserted ages, here you’re ostensibly surrounded by the Rivenese, the vaguely Native-American-like inhabitants of the archipelago. Rather conveniently for Cyan, however, the Rivenese are terrified of strangers, and scurry away into hiding whenever you enter a scene. The few named characters you meet, including the principal villain, are likewise forever just leaving when you come upon them, or showing up, giving speeches, and then going away again before you can interact with them. By 1997, this sort of thing was feeling more tired than clever.</p>
<div id="attachment_5927"><p><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2024/05/riven/riven1/" rel="attachment wp-att-5927"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5927" src="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/riven1-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/riven1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/riven1.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-5927">Rand Miller, returning in the role of the patriarch Atrus from <em>Myst</em>, gives you your marching orders and sends you on your way in the introductory movie. <em>Riven</em> makes more extensive use of such scenes involving real actors than <em>Myst</em>, but it’s done well, and never overdone. The end result is about as un-cheesy as these techniques can possibly look to modern eyes.</p></div>
<p>The real story, in both <em>Myst</em> and <em>Riven</em>, is the backstory that caused these spaces to become the places they are, a backstory which you uncover as you explore them. And in this area, I’m happy to say, <em>Riven</em> actually does outdo its predecessor. Almost everything there is to find out about how the ages of <em>Myst</em> became as they are is conveyed in one astonishingly clumsy infodump, a set of books which you find in a library on that first island after solving the first couple of puzzles. These stop your progress dead for an hour or so as you read through them, after which you’re back to exploring, never to be troubled by much of any exposition again.</p>
<p>By the time of <em>Riven</em>, however, the Miller brothers had learned about the existence of something called dramatic pacing. Here, too, most of the real story comes in the form of books and journals, but these are scattered around the islands, providing an enticement to solve puzzles in order to acquire and read them. The <em>Myst</em> “universe” grew considerably in depth and coherency between <em>Myst</em> and <em>Riven</em>, thanks to a trilogy of novels written by the British science-fiction author David Wingrove in close collaboration with the Miller brothers during that interim. In <em>Riven</em>, then, you get some of the same sense that you get in <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, that you are only scraping the surface of a world that goes much deeper than its foreground sights and sounds. “<em>The Lord of the Rings</em> is so satisfying because of the details,” said Rand Miller at the time. “You get the feeling that the world you’re reading about is real. Different but real. That’s how we go about designing.” Like Tolkien, the Miller brothers went so far as to make up the beginnings at least of a coherent language for their land’s inhabitants. This sense of established lore, combined with the improved pacing and better writing, makes <em>Riven’</em>s backstory more compelling than that of <em>Myst</em>, makes uncovering more of it feel like a worthwhile goal in itself. Instead of providing a mere excuse for the gameplay, as in <em>Myst</em>, <em>Riven’</em>s backstory comes to fuel its gameplay to a large extent.</p>
<p>And this starts to take us into the territory of the first of the two things that <em>Riven</em> does really, really well, does so well in fact that you might just be willing to discount all of the failings I’ve been belaboring up to this point. The archipelago is a truly intriguing, even awe-inspiring place to explore, thank not just to the cutting-edge 3D-rendering technology that was used to bring it to life, but — and even more so — the <em>thought</em> that went into the place.</p>
<div id="attachment_5926"><p><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2024/05/riven/riven0/" rel="attachment wp-att-5926"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5926" src="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/riven0-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/riven0-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/riven0.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-5926"><em>Riven</em> makes its priorities clear from the beginning, when it asks you to set up your screen and your speakers to provide the immersive audiovisual experience it intends for you to have.</p></div>
<p>The adjective “surreal” seems unavoidable when discussing <em>Myst</em>, so much so that Brøderbund built it right into their advertising tagline. (“The Surrealistic Adventure That Will Become Your World.”) Looking back on it now, though, I realize that the surrealism of <em>Myst</em> was as much a product of process as intention. The 3D-modeling software that was used to create the scenery of <em>Myst</em> couldn’t render genuinely realistic scenes; everything it churned out was too geometrical, too stiff, too uniform in color to look in any sense <em>real</em>. The result was surrealism, that forlorn, otherworldly, even vaguely disturbing stripe of beauty that became the hallmark of <em>Myst</em> and its many imitators.</p>
<p>But I would not call <em>Riven</em> surreal. The improved technology that enabled it, on both the rendering side — meaning all those Silicon Graphics servers and workstations, with their complex ray-tracing algorithms — and the consumer-facing side — meaning the latest home computers, with their capability of displaying millions of nuanced shades of color onscreen at once — led to a more believable world. The key to it all is in the textures, the patterns that are overlaid onto the frame of a 3D model in lieu of blocks of solid color to make it look like a real object made out of wood, metal, or dirt. Cyan traveled to Santa Fe, New Mexico, to capture thousands of textures. The same visual qualities that led to that state being dubbed the “Land of Enchantment” and drew artists like Georgia O’Keeffe to its high deserts suffuses the game, from the pueblo walls of the Rivenese homes to the pebbly cliff-side paths, from <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2015/02/t-plus-0-the-fulcrum-of-history">an old iron tower rusting in the sun</a> to the ragged vegetation huddling around it. You can almost feel the sun on your back and the sweat on your skin.</p>
<p>My wife and I are inveterate hikers these days, planning most of our holidays around where we can get out and walk. <em>Riven</em> made me want to climb through the screen and roam its landscapes for myself. <em>Myst</em> has its charms, but they are nothing like this. When I compare the two games, I think about what a revelation the battered, weathered world of Tatooine was when <em>Star Wars</em> hit cinemas in 1977, how at odds it was with the antiseptic sleekness of the science-fiction films that preceded it. <em>Riven</em> is almost as much of a revelation when set beside <em>Myst</em> and its many clones.</p>

<p>The visuals both feed and are fed by the backstory and the world-building. The islands are replete with little details that have nothing to do with solving the game, that exist simply as natural, necessary parts of this place you’re exploring. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aa-JMzTBH00&amp;t=2s">a perceptive video essay</a>, YouTube creator VZedshows notes how “the lived-in world of <em>Riven</em> lets us look at a house and say, ‘Okay, that’s a house.’ And that’s it. A totally different thought than seeing a log cabin on Myst Island and saying, ‘Okay, that’s a house. But what is it <em>for</em>?’ The puzzles in <em>Riven</em> melt into the world around them.”</p>
<p>Which brings us neatly to the other thing that <em>Riven</em> does remarkably well, the one aimed at the gamers rather than the tourists. Quite simply, <em>Riven</em> is one of the most elegantly sophisticated puzzle games ever created. This facet of it is not for everyone. (I’m not even sure it’s for me, about which more in a moment.) But it does what it sets out to do uncompromisingly well. <em>Riven</em> is a puzzle game that doesn’t feel like a puzzle game. It rather feels like you really have been dropped onto this archipelago, with its foreign civilization and all of its foreign artifacts, and then left to your own devices to make sense of it all.</p>
<div id="attachment_5929"><p><a href="https://www.filfre.net/2024/05/riven/riven3/" rel="attachment wp-att-5929"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5929" src="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/riven3-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/riven3-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.filfre.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/riven3.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-5929">Many of <em>Riven’</em>s puzzles are as much anthropological as mechanical. For example, you have to learn to translate the different symbols of a foreign number system.</p></div>
<p>This is undoubtedly more realistic than the ages of <em>Myst</em>, whose puzzles stand out from their environs so plainly that they might as well be circled with a bright red Sharpie. But does it lead to a better game? As usual, the answer is in the eye of the beholder. Ironically, almost everything that can be said about <em>Riven’</em>s puzzles can be cast as either a positive or a negative. If you’re looking for an adventure game that’s nails-hard and yet scrupulously fair — a combination that’s rarer than it ought to be — <em>Riven</em> will not disappoint you. If not, however, it will put you right off just as soon as you grow bored with idle wandering and begin to ask yourself what the game expects you to actually be <em>doing</em>. <em>Myst</em> was widely perceived in the 1990s as being more difficult than it really was; <em>Riven</em>, by contrast, well and truly earns its reputation.</p>
<p>Each of <em>Myst’</em>s ages is a little game unto itself when it comes to its puzzles; you never need to use tools or information from one age to overcome a problem in another one. For better or for worse, <em>Riven</em> is not like that — not at all. Puzzles and clues are scattered willy-nilly all over the five islands; you might be expected to connect a symbol you’re looking at now to a gadget you last poked at hours and hours ago. Careful, copious note-taking is the only practical way to proceed. I daresay you might end up spending more time poring over your real-world journal, looking for ways to combine and thereby to make sense of the data therein, than you do looking at the monitor screen. Because most of the geography is open to you from the very beginning — this is arguably <em>Riven’</em>s one real concession to the needs of the marketplace, being the one that allows it to cater to the tourists as well as the gamers — there isn’t the gated progress you get in so many other puzzly adventure games, with new areas and new problems being introduced gradually as you solve the earlier ones. No, <em>Riven</em> throws it all at you from the start, in one big lump. You just have to keep plugging away at it when even your apparently successful deductions don’t seem to be yielding much in the way of concrete rewards, trusting that it will all come together in one big whoosh at the end.</p>
<p>All of which is to say that <em>Riven</em> is a <em>slow</em> game, the polar opposite of the instant gratification that defines the videogame medium in the eyes of so many. There are few shortcuts for moving through its sprawling, fragmented geography — something you’ll need to do a lot of, thanks to its refusal to contain its puzzles within smaller areas as <em>Myst</em> does. Just double-checking some observation you think you made earlier or confirming that some effect took place as expected represents a significant investment in time. Back in the day, when everyone was playing directly from CD, <em>Riven</em> was even slower than it is today, requiring you to swap discs every time you traveled to a different island.<span><a role="button" tabindex="0" onclick="footnote_moveToReference_5916_1('footnote_plugin_reference_5916_1_2');" onkeypress="footnote_moveToReference_5916_1('footnote_plugin_reference_5916_1_2');"><sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_5916_1_2">[2]</sup></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_5916_1_2">Some months after its original release, <em>Riven</em> became one of the first games ever to be made available on DVD-ROM. No game benefited more from the switch in storage technology; not only were DVD drives faster than CD drives, but a single DVD disc was capacious enough to contain the whole of <em>Riven</em>.</span></span> In <a href="https://eblong.com/zarf/gamerev/riven.html">his vintage 1997 review</a>, Andrew Plotkin — a fellow who is without a doubt much, much smarter than I am, at least when it comes to stuff like this — said that he was able to solve <em>Riven</em> in about twenty hours, using just one hint. It will probably take more mortal intelligences some multiple of one or both of those figures.</p>
<p>Your reaction to <em>Riven</em> when approached in “gamer” mode will depend on whether you think this kind of intensive intellectual challenge is fun or not, as well as whether you have the excess intellectual and temporal bandwidth in your current life to go all-in on such a major undertaking. I must sheepishly confess that my answer to the first question is more prevaricating than definitive, while my answer to the second one is a pretty solid no. In the abstract, I do understand the appeal of what <em>Riven</em> is offering, understand how <em>awesome</em> it must feel to put all of these disparate pieces together without help. Nevertheless, when I approached the game for this article, I couldn’t quite find the motivation to persevere down that road. <em>Riven</em> wants you to work a little harder for your fun than the current version of myself is willing to do. I don’t futz around with my notebook too long before I start looking out the window and thinking about how nice it would be to take a walk in <em>real</em> nature. I take enough notes doing research for the articles I write; I’m not sure I want to do so much research <em>inside</em> a game.</p>
<p>Prompted partially by my experience with <em>Riven</em>, I’ve been musing a fair amount lately about the way we receive games, and especially how the commentary you read on this site and others similar to it can be out of step with the way the games in question existed for their players in their heyday. I’m subject to the tyranny of my editorial calendar, to the need to just <em>finish</em> things, one way or another, and move on. <em>Riven</em> is not well-suited to such a mindset. In my travels around the Internet, I’ve noticed that those who remember the game most fondly often took months or years to finish it, or never finished it at all. It existed for them as a tempting curiosity, to be picked up from time to time and poked at, just to see if a little more progress was possible here or there, or whether the brainstorm that came to them unbidden while driving home from work that day might bear some sort of fruit. It’s an open question whether even folks who don’t have an editorial schedule to keep can recapture that mindset here and now, in the third decade (!) of the 21st century, when more entertainment of every conceivable type than any of us could possibly consume in a lifetime is constantly luring us away from any such hard nut as <em>Riven</em>. As of this writing, Cyan is preparing a remake of <em>Riven</em>. It will be interesting to see what concessions, if any, they chose to make to our new reality.</p>
<p>Even in the late 1990s, there was the palpable sense that <em>Riven</em> represented the end of an era, that even Cyan would not be able to catch lightning in a bottle a third time with yet another cerebral, contemplative, zeitgeist-stamping single-player puzzle game. Both Richard Vander Wende and Robyn Miller quit the company as soon as the obligatory rounds of promotional interviews had been completed, leaving the <em>Myst</em> franchise’s future solely in the hands of Rand Miller. Robyn’s stated reason for departing brings to the fore some of the frustrations I have with Cyan’s work. He said that he was most interested in telling stories, and had concluded that computer games just weren’t any good at that: “I felt like, you know what? It’s not working. This whole story thing is not happening, and one of the reasons it’s not happening is because of the medium. It’s not what this medium is good at.” So, he said, he wanted to work in film instead.</p>
<p>The obvious response is that Cyan had never actually tried to tell an engaging foreground story, had rather been content to leave you always picking up the breadcrumbs of backstory. Cyan’s stubborn conservatism in terms of form and their slightly snooty insistence on living in their own hermetically sealed bubble, blissfully unaware of the innovations going on around them in their industry in both storytelling and other aspects of game making, strike me as this unquestionably talented group’s least attractive qualities by far. When asked once what his favorite games were, Richard Vander Wende said he didn’t have any: “Robyn and I are not really interested in games of any kind. We’re more interested in building worlds. To us, <em>Myst</em> and <em>Riven</em> are not ‘games’ at all.” Such scare-quoted condescension does no one any favors.</p>
<p>Then again, that’s only one way of looking at it. Another way is to recognize that <em>Riven</em> is exactly the game — okay, if you like, the world — that its creators wanted to make. It’s worth acknowledging, even celebrating, as the brave artistic statement it is. Love it or hate it, <em>Riven</em> knows what it wants to be, and succeeds in being exactly that — no more, no less. Rather than <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, call it the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/338798.Ulysses"><em>Ulysses</em></a> of gaming: a daunting creation by any standard, but one that can be very rewarding to those willing and able to meet it where it lives. That a game like this outsold dozens of its more visceral, immediate rivals on the store shelves of the late 1990s is surely one of the wonders of the age.</p>

<p dir="auto">For those interested in self-hosting, here are is what you need to get your own Netris server up and running:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Nvidia GPU</strong>: Unfortunately, this setup is exclusive to Nvidia GPUs. If you don't own one, consider renting from cloud services like AWS, GCP, or Vast.ai. We highly recommend this approach.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>CUDA</strong>: For GPU acceleration, CUDA version <code>12.0</code> or newer is required. Verify your CUDA installation by running <code>nvcc --version</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Docker</strong>: Ensure you have <code>docker</code> and <code>nvidia-docker</code> are up to date to avoid compatibility issues with CUDA. You can check your Docker version by running <code>docker --version</code> in your terminal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>GPU Driver</strong>: Ensure your GPU drivers are up to date to avoid compatibility issues with CUDA. Nvidia driver version <code>520.56.06</code> or newer is required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Xorg Display</strong>: Your Nvidia GPU should not be attached to a running X display server. You can confirm this by running <code>nvidia-smi</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Nvidia-DRM</strong>: Make sure that the <code>nvidia-drm</code> module has been loaded and that the module is loaded with the flag <code>modeset=1</code>. Confirm this by running <code>sudo cat /sys/module/nvidia_drm/parameters/modeset</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
<div dir="auto"><p dir="auto">Tip</p>
<p dir="auto">Typically, if your setup meets the necessary CUDA requirements, the <code>nvidia-drm</code> module will already be loaded, particularly in AWS G4dn instances. ~ 💡</p>

<p>With a question as weird as this, it's of course impossible to say for sure -- but I'll eat my hat if my first hunch isn't correct. :)</p>

<p>The only way I can think of, how such unrelated things could be linked is this:
After installing (well, extracting) Dwarf Fortress, instead of going to the directory every time and running it with <code>./df</code>, you wanted to be able to run it from anywhere, like any old command. You added the Dwarf Fortress directory to your <code>$PATH</code>, <em>before</em> the system directories, perhaps by chance, perhaps because you noticed it didn't work otherwise, and you'd instead just get information about your filesystems.</p>

<p>Dwarf Fortress's executable is named <code>df</code>, which is also the name of a system tool for displaying disk space usage of your filesystems, creating a collision. By making it so that when you type <code>df</code>, Dwarf Fortress starts, you've shadowed the system tool, so when a script wants to - let's say - check if you have enough free space for unpacking an archive, instead of invoking <code>df</code> - the system tool - it'll start Dwarf Fortress instead. And after you quit Dwarf Fortress, the poor little script will be very confused as to why it wasn't given the disk usage information it asked for.</p>

<p>Anyway, thanks for the laugh, this has to be among the funniest problems I've ever seen voiced on StackExchange. :)</p>

<p>            The Swiss national airline has now incorporated the shark skin onto all of its long-haul 777 aircraft, with the final example to adorn the technology receiving it at the start of May.
    </p>    


<p>            The final aircraft registered HB-JNF, spent the month of April in Hong Kong, where it is believed to have received the skin, according to <a href="https://www.flightradar24.com/data/aircraft/hb-jnf#" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Flightradar24</a> data. Last year, the airline saved nearly 2,200 tonnes of kerosene despite its 777 fleet not being fully fitted at the time. Claus Bauer, Head of Technical Fleet Management at SWISS said:
    </p>    <blockquote>
                        
<p>            “We are very pleased with the results that we have achieved with AeroSHARK to date. We’re proud, too, to be the first airline in the world to have equipped an entire aircraft fleet with this innovative technology. Each aircraft takes about a week to have its AeroSHARK film applied, which requires high-precision workmanship from our personnel.
    </p>    
            </blockquote><blockquote>
                        
<p>            I am delighted that our commitment to this technology is delivering such positive results, and is enabling us at SWISS to take a further substantial step in making our flight operations more sustainable.”

                        What is AeroSHARK
               </h2>
<p>            Rather than being completely smooth, shark skin is unique in its ability to minimize drag through specific grooves, which, in aviation terms, allows for a smoother and more efficient flight.
    </p>    
<p>            AeroSHARK replicates this hydrodynamic property on aircraft. It is a <em>"special film"</em> made up of <em>"tiny 50-micrometre riblets that reduce aerodynamic drag during flight."</em>

<p>             At the time of the inaugural departure of a SWISS 777 with the <a href="https://simpleflying.com/swiss-boeing-777-sharksin-surface-technology/">technology back in October 2022</a>, CEO Dieter Vranckx said:
    </p>    <blockquote>
                        
<p>            “Our aircraft fleet is already one of the most advanced and most carbon-efficient in Europe. Thanks to AeroSHARK, we can enhance these credentials even further in a field where every saving counts. We are proud to be the first passenger airline in the world to adopt this new technology. And we will continue to consistently invest in such sustainable solutions.”

<p>             The airline is now examining other parts of its fleet to see whether AeroSHARK technology could be installed. In particular, the carrier referenced the remaining aircraft in its long-haul fleet and, eventually, its medium-haul fleet.

<p>            In other words, SWISS' A330s and A340s are next on the table in its existing fleet. The airline also plans to take delivery of a new long-haul aircraft type shortly, with the arrival of its Airbus A350s in the second quarter of 2025.
    </p>    
<p>            These will replace the Airbus A340s. While unlikely and dependent on the technology's cost, they could still be retrofitted. The airline only has four Airbus A340-300s in service.
    </p>    
<p>            The type is to <em>"operate longer than planned" </em>to provide additional capacity as the A330 fleet begins its retrofit program in 18 months, the airline's Chief Commercial Officer Heike Birlenbach tells <a href="https://aviationweek.com/air-transport/airlines-lessors/swiss-preps-long-haul-fleet-retrofit-will-keep-a340s-flying" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Aviation Week.</a>

<hr>
<p>This is a set of notes for learning <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus">calculus</a> using the <a href="https://julialang.org/"><code>Julia</code></a> language. <code>Julia</code> is an open-source programming language with an easy to learn syntax that is well suited for this task.</p>
<p>Read “<a href="https://jverzani.github.io/CalculusWithJuliaNotes.jl/misc/getting_started_with_julia.html">Getting started with Julia</a>” to learn how to install and customize <code>Julia</code> for following along with these notes. Read “<a href="https://jverzani.github.io/CalculusWithJuliaNotes.jl/misc/julia_interfaces.html">Julia interfaces</a> to review different ways to interact with a <code>Julia</code> installation.</p>
<p>Since the mid 90s there has been a push to teach calculus using many different points of view. The <a href="http://www.math.harvard.edu/~knill/pedagogy/harvardcalculus/">Harvard</a> style rule of four says that as much as possible the conversation should include a graphical, numerical, algebraic, and verbal component. These notes use the programming language <a href="http://julialang.org/">Julia</a> to illustrate the graphical, numerical, and, at times, the algebraic aspects of calculus.</p>
<p>There are many examples of integrating a computer algebra system (such as <code>Mathematica</code>, <code>Maple</code>, or <code>Sage</code>) into the calculus conversation. Computer algebra systems can be magical. The popular <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/">WolframAlpha</a> website calls the full power of <code>Mathematica</code> while allowing an informal syntax that is flexible enough to be used as a backend for Apple’s Siri feature. (“Siri what is the graph of x squared minus 4?”) For learning purposes, computer algebra systems model very well the algebraic/symbolic treatment of the material while providing means to illustrate the numeric aspects. These notes are a bit different in that <code>Julia</code> is primarily used for the numeric style of computing and the algebraic/symbolic treatment is added on. Doing the symbolic treatment by hand can be very beneficial while learning, and computer algebra systems make those exercises seem kind of redundant, as the finished product can be produced much easier.</p>
<p>Our real goal is to get at the concepts using technology as much as possible without getting bogged down in the mechanics of the computer language. We feel <code>Julia</code> has a very natural syntax that makes the initial start up not so much more difficult than using a calculator, but with a language that has a tremendous upside. The notes restrict themselves to a reduced set of computational concepts. This set is sufficient for working many of the problems in calculus, but do not cover thoroughly many aspects of programming. (Those who are interested can go off on their own and <code>Julia</code> provides a rich opportunity to do so.) Within this restricted set, are operators that make many of the computations of calculus reduce to a function call of the form <code>action(function, arguments...)</code>. With a small collection of actions that can be composed, many of the problems associated with introductory calculus can be attacked.</p>
<p>These notes are presented in pages covering a fairly focused concept, in a spirit similar to a section of a book. Just like a book, there are try-it-yourself questions at the end of each page. All have a limited number of self-graded answers. These notes borrow ideas from many sources, for example <span data-cites="Strang">Strang (<a href="https://jverzani.github.io/CalculusWithJuliaNotes.jl/references.html#ref-Strang" role="doc-biblioref">n.d.</a>)</span>, <span data-cites="Knill">Knill (<a href="https://jverzani.github.io/CalculusWithJuliaNotes.jl/references.html#ref-Knill" role="doc-biblioref">n.d.</a>)</span>, <span data-cites="Schey">Schey (<a href="https://jverzani.github.io/CalculusWithJuliaNotes.jl/references.html#ref-Schey" role="doc-biblioref">1997</a>)</span>, <span data-cites="Thomas">Hass, Heil, and Weir (<a href="https://jverzani.github.io/CalculusWithJuliaNotes.jl/references.html#ref-Thomas" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>, <span data-cites="RogawskiAdams">Rogawski, Adams, and Franzosa (<a href="https://jverzani.github.io/CalculusWithJuliaNotes.jl/references.html#ref-RogawskiAdams" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>, several Wikipedia pages, and other sources..</p>
<p>These notes are accompanied by a <code>Julia</code> package <code>CalculusWithJulia</code> that provides some simple functions to streamline some common tasks and loads some useful packages that will be used repeatedly.</p>
<p>These notes are presented as a Quarto book. To learn more about Quarto books visit <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/books">https://quarto.org/docs/books</a>.</p>
<p>These notes may be compiled into a <code>pdf</code> file through Quarto. As the result is rather large, we do not provide that file for download. For the interested reader, downloading the repository, instantiating the environment, and running <code>quarto</code> to render to <code>pdf</code> in the <code>quarto</code> subdirectory should produce that file (after some time).</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div tabindex="-1" id="___gatsby"><h2>Peanut Butter Spinner</h2><h6>May 15, 2024</h6><p>I love peanut butter. I also hate mixing it. There are <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=peanut+butter+mixer&amp;ia=web">many products</a>
available to mix peanut butter for you, but I wanted my own design that took no effort to use. I'm looking for a "set it and forget it" solution. For those who
don't know what I'm talking about, many natural peanut butters are not homogeneous at all times. The oil and the nutty material separate, and thus require mixing to return it to buttery consistency.</p>
<p>Here's how I made my own.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdaringe.com/static/d4327ab6a63c84956edd1d9de813b340/front.png" alt="Chris D's Peanut Butter Mixer">
<small>My very own peanut butter spinner device.</small></p><p>First off, why do this? Mixing peanut butter is obnoxious. Further, I am loyal to Adam's Peanut Butter. Adam's is good flavor and
simple ingredients.  I wish they sold absolutely enormous jars or buckets of
it. Alas, the biggest I can find are the plastic container
versions from Costco, shown below in the video below.</p>

<p>SPONSOR ME ADAMS I NEED MORE PEANUT BUTTER!</p>
<p>I wanted a solution that doesn't require anything other than placing the jar on something and hitting a go button.
In this case, it ended up being a switch. The rotary switch has a fully off mode, and otherwise is an adjustable potentiometer.
I source 5V power from a USB adapter mean to snap into cigarette lighter holes in vehicles.
USB power =&gt; motor control board =&gt; motor. The motor is itty bitty, and has a nice little gearbox for some extra torque.
Here's a zoom in:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Well I got news for you friend, it works well enough! Although I cannot say that it works perfectly, after ~20 minutes of care free rotation, minimally, there is not a layer of oil when the jar is upright and stationary. The oil is perhaps not perfectly distributed into the center of the jar. However, enough mixing has ocurred around the outer radius such that a quick manual mix on first open is much more easily doable with a knife. Perfect? Nah. Good enough? Absolutely!</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Scientists finally found a way to thaw frozen human brain tissue without damaging it. In a groundbreaking development, scientists have discovered a new technique that allows human brain tissue to be frozen and thawed while maintaining its normal function.</p><p>This breakthrough, achieved by a team led by Zhicheng Shao at Fudan University in Shanghai, China, could potentially revolutionize the study of neurological conditions. The researchers detailed <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-methods/fulltext/S2667-2375(24)00121-8">their findings </a>in <em>Cell Reports Methods</em>.</p>
<p>The team says it grew self-organizing <a href="https://bgr.com/science/scientists-3d-printed-functional-human-brain-tissue-for-the-first-time-ever/">brain samples</a>, known as organoids, from human embryonic stem cells for three weeks, allowing the development of neurons and neural stem cells. They then tested various chemical compounds to determine which combinations could help keep the frozen human brain tissue alive and enable growth after thawing.

</p><p>The most successful combination consisted of methylcellulose, ethylene glycol, DMSO, and Y27632. The researchers call it MEDY, and they suspect it somehow interferes with a pathway that would otherwise initiate cell death, allowing for the tissue to freeze and be thawed without incident.

They found that the thawed organoids closely resembled their unfrozen counterparts’ appearance, growth, and function, even after being frozen in MEDY for 18 months. Similar results were observed across frozen human brain tissue representing different brain regions.</p>
<p>The researchers also applied their technique to three-millimeter cubes of brain tissue from a 9-month-old girl with epilepsy. The tissue maintained its pre-freezing structure and remained active in a laboratory culture for at least two weeks after being thawed.</p><p>According to researchers from the University of Surrey and the University of Birmingham in the UK, this breakthrough in freezing human brain tissue could lead to improved investigations of brain development in the lab for health research.</p>
<p>While significantly more research and the use of larger tissues are needed, some suggest that this work could eventually lead to the freezing of entire brains. Some scientists envision a future where patients with terminal conditions or astronauts traveling to distant star systems could be cryopreserved, with MEDY representing “one small step” towards that goal.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>This is the story of how I hosted the most <em>epic </em>game of Capture the Flag ever. I've broken it into parts so it's easier to read.</p><h2 id="i-inception"> I: Inception</h2><blockquote>“Listen, there's something you should know about me... about inception. An idea is like a virus, resilient, highly contagious. The smallest seed of an idea can grow. It can grow to define or destroy you.” – Dom Cobb, <em>Inception (2010)</em></blockquote><p>I was eating steak and potatoes with my family &amp; another family on a lovely evening in late March. Since I would graduate high school in May, their family's father (who is named Taylor) gave me some life advice.</p><p>He suggested I do more (good-natured) shenanigans in my life. I think that advice should be required advice for <em>everyone</em>. Life is too short to always "go with the flow" —&nbsp;because when you're older, you'll wish for good memories of your youth. The <em>best</em> memories come from doing silly/fun shenanigans with your friends.¹</p><p>Because of Taylor's advice, for the next few weeks, I had this nagging voice in the back of my head. The voice said "yo Nathan you should <em>really </em>do some shenanigans before you and your friends all graduate and go your separate ways." So I thought each day about good-natured shenanigans —&nbsp;you know, the ones that wouldn't get me in trouble. And then one day, I stumbled across a YouTube video of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZM_hPF1hsY&amp;ref=ntnbr.com" rel="noreferrer">four grown men playing a 96-hour game of Capture the Flag across the entirety of Japan</a>.²</p><p>I showed the series to my sister, and she and I were both hooked. We watched the entire series (which is ~280 minutes long!) in just three short days. Then I realized <em>exactly </em>what my next shenanigan would be. I couldn't fly to another country and pay for miles and miles of transit like the Jet Lag team did. But I could very well construct a large game of Capture the Flag at a local park and get all my friends to come. Because who doesn't like a great game of Capture the Flag?</p><p>I was determined to execute on my <em>awesome </em>idea, but I needed to do some planning first. After all, I wanted this Capture the Flag game to be certifiably epic, so I couldn't just whip it all together in one afternoon.</p><h2 id="ii-planning">II: Planning</h2><blockquote>“A goal without a plan is just a wish.” –&nbsp;Antoine de Saint-Exupéry</blockquote><p>My first step was to find a public park to play Capture the Flag in. I quickly identified two candidates: Zilker and Auditorium Shores. Then I used <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/about/mymaps/?ref=ntnbr.com" rel="noreferrer">Google MyMaps</a> to quickly sketch a possible playing area. Here's what my first prototype looked like:</p><figure><img src="https://www.ntnbr.com/content/images/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-11-at-6.09.35-PM.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1378" srcset="https://www.ntnbr.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-11-at-6.09.35-PM.png 600w, https://www.ntnbr.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-11-at-6.09.35-PM.png 1000w, https://www.ntnbr.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-11-at-6.09.35-PM.png 1600w, https://www.ntnbr.com/content/images/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-11-at-6.09.35-PM.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>My first MyMaps prototype.</span></figcaption></figure><p>I quickly grew to dislike my first prototype. The playing area:</p><ul><li>was far too large (almost 50 acres) </li><li>had almost no interesting terrain (like trees or natural obstacles) </li><li>was substantially uneven (red team has a clear advantage)</li></ul><p>So I ditched Zilker and moved my efforts to Auditorium Shores. I made 3-4 more prototype maps, modifying them when the territories were unequal or when the boundaries were unclear. I finally came up with the finished map after about 3 hours of work:</p><figure><img src="https://www.ntnbr.com/content/images/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-15-at-2.22.58-PM.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1254" srcset="https://www.ntnbr.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-15-at-2.22.58-PM.png 600w, https://www.ntnbr.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-15-at-2.22.58-PM.png 1000w, https://www.ntnbr.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-15-at-2.22.58-PM.png 1600w, https://www.ntnbr.com/content/images/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-15-at-2.22.58-PM.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>The finished map!</span></figcaption></figure><p>I also invited 31 of my friends to play Capture the Flag, because I wanted as many people to play as possible. Finally, I had to order $120 worth of equipment on Amazon:</p><ul><li>30 flag football belts &amp; 90 accompanying flags (15 blue belts, 15 red belts, 45 blue flags, 45 red flags)</li><li>48 orange cones (2 packs of 24)</li><li>8 playground balls (4 blue, 4 red)</li></ul><p>What is that equipment for? I'll tell you about it in the next section.</p><h2 id="iii-game-design">III: Game Design</h2><blockquote>"To design a game is to imagine the person who will eventually play it." – Gabrielle Zevin, <em>Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow</em></blockquote><p>I keep one 'golden rule' in mind for large games like this: they must be easy to explain in three minutes or less. This is because people invariably forget rules if they are too complicated.</p><p>I kept many of the classic Capture the Flag rules, because they are intuitive and form the basis of the game. But I made a few key changes:</p><ol><li>There is a neutral zone (the yellow zone on the finished map) that no one may be tagged in. The neutral zone is important, as you'll see below.</li><li>Each team has two "flags" (aka playground balls) instead of one. To win, you must bring both the "flags" from the opposing team's side back to the neutral zone. The "flags" are playground balls because it's more fun if you can throw them to your teammates.</li><li>Everyone wears a flag football belt with their team color. This eliminates all arguments related to "did this person really tag this other person?" To tag someone, you have to rip one of the three flags off their belt.</li><li>If you are tagged (ie. someone pulls one of your belt flags while you're in enemy territory), you cannot participate in the game until you walk back to the neutral zone and wait 1 minute. This is better than having "jail", because with "jail", some players may be out of the game for a long time.</li></ol><p>Those are the main changes. Everything else is broadly the same as normal Capture the Flag.</p><h2 id="iv-rules">IV: Rules</h2><blockquote>"You have to learn the rules of the game. And then you have to play better than anyone else." –&nbsp;Dianne Feinstein</blockquote><p>Here's the whole list of initial rules. Feel free to skip this part and go read about the strategy in the next section, because this section is kind of boring.</p><ol><li>Play nice &amp; be honest. No full-body contact.</li><li>Players may not leave the playing area during the game.</li><li>There is a red team and a blue team, each with an equal number of players. Everyone wears a flag football belt of their team color.</li><li>The first team to bring back both enemy "flags" (balls) from the enemy territory to the neutral zone wins the game.</li><li>If you are tagged (ie. someone pulls one of your belt flags while you're in enemy territory), you cannot participate in the game whatsoever until you walk back to the neutral zone and wait 1 minute.</li><li>You cannot be tagged in the neutral zone.</li><li>Your team must place "flags" of your own team's color:<ol><li>on the ground; </li><li>such that they are clearly visible from two distinct angles;</li><li>at least 18 feet away from all boundary lines; </li><li>at least 18 feet away from your team's other flag.</li></ol></li><li>You cannot move "flags" of your own team's color, except in exceptional circumstances (prevent them from going into the lake, prevent them from rolling into the road, etc).</li><li>You must always stay 6 feet away from balls of your own team's color, unless you are adjusting them momentarily.</li><li>If you are tagged while carrying a "flag", you must drop the "flag" where you stand.</li><li>You may throw a ball if you have it. But if the ball touches the ground after your throw, you are automatically tagged and the other team may move the ball back to where you stood when the ball touched the ground.</li></ol><h2 id="v-strategy">V: Strategy</h2><blockquote>"All warfare is based on deception." – Sun Tzu, <em>The Art Of War</em></blockquote><p>I invited thirty-one people, and nineteen people showed up by the time I explained all the rules. That made for a solid game of 10v10 Capture the Flag. There was a lot of interesting strategy that emerged throughout the three games we played!</p><ol><li><strong>Flag Location. </strong>In the first game, both teams had the sound strategy to hide their flags near the back of the zone. This makes intuitive sense: it's harder to find &amp; retrieve flags far from the halfway line. But this also made the flag locations easy to predict. So in the second game, both teams placed one of their flags in more unconventional locations. This made them harder to find, but when they <em>were </em>found, they were much easier to bring back to the neutral zone. In the third game, one team even stationed zero defenders around one of their flags, which worked very well (the other team couldn't find it).</li><li><strong>Offense vs. Defense.</strong> I thought the game rules would encourage considerably more offense than defense (because "respawning" after being tagged is a pretty easy endeavor). I was wrong —&nbsp;there was a lot more defensive play than I expected. But in the games we played, the team with the more aggressive offense almost always won.</li><li><strong>Endurance over Speed. </strong>I didn't realize how big the playing area was until we actually started playing. After just ~10 minutes, most of the players were exhausted, and the advantage pivoted to players who had more endurance (and could evade being tagged for longer). I thought the game would be dominated by the fastest sprinters, and that was not at all true.</li></ol><h2 id="vi-aftermath">VI: Aftermath</h2><blockquote>"Be prepared." –&nbsp;Motto of the Boy Scouts</blockquote><p>I had the foresight to bring a cooler full of two gallons of water, two bags of apples, and a bunch of individually-wrapped cheddar cheese slices.³ This was an excellent decision. The snacks and the drinks really helped people stay motivated throughout the 90 minutes that we played. I will definitely bring snacks and drinks the next time I host Capture the Flag.</p><p>I also redid the map. Many of the players (including myself) thought it was too big, so I cut off a large portion of the playing area that most players never ventured into. The new map (which is only ~16 acres large) should encourage faster play &amp; facilitate better team communication.</p><figure><img src="https://www.ntnbr.com/content/images/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-15-at-2.32.15-PM.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1254" srcset="https://www.ntnbr.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-15-at-2.32.15-PM.png 600w, https://www.ntnbr.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-15-at-2.32.15-PM.png 1000w, https://www.ntnbr.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-15-at-2.32.15-PM.png 1600w, https://www.ntnbr.com/content/images/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-15-at-2.32.15-PM.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>The new map. The halfway line is slightly different, but the team territories are broadly the same.</span></figcaption></figure><p>Everyone who came <em>really </em>enjoyed Capture the Flag, and there were no rule disputes or proposed rule changes. I'm really happy that all my planning turned out well, and I'm excited to host more games of Capture the Flag while I'm attending UT Austin.</p><p>¹ If you don't believe me, ask anyone over the age of 30 this question: "What are your best memories from your youth?" I can 90% guarantee you they'll say "having fun with my friends" or "doing &lt;cool/awesome/slightly-stupid&gt; thing with my buddies".</p><p>² I want to highlight how awesome the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@jetlagthegame?ref=ntnbr.com" rel="noreferrer">Jet Lag: The Game</a> channel is. They make high-quality, super-fun videos about massive &amp; intriguing games they've dreamt up. Would highly recommend watching a few of their videos.</p><p>³ I stored the ice packs (for the cooler), the apples, the cheddar slices, and the waters in the school fridge and freezer. Unfortunately, I mixed the freezer and fridge up somehow (?? silly me) and placed the apples, cheddar slices, and waters in the freezer and the ice packs in the fridge. When I realized my mistake, I was very annoyed. But it ended up working out, because slightly-frozen apples are actually delicious &amp; the water was slightly icy, so it stayed extra cool in the 80 °F heat.</p>

</p><h3><a name="sec_1">1. Motivation</a></h3><p><a name="sec_1">

My goal is to build a Free/OpenSource computer from the ground up, so I may completely trust that the entire hardware+software system's behavior is 100% attributable to its fully available HDL (Hardware Description Language) and Software sources.<br>
More importantly, I need all the compilers and associated toolchains involved in building the overall system (from HDL and Software sources) to be Free/OpenSource, and to be themselves buildable and runnable on the computer system being described. In other words, I need a </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting">self-hosting</a> Free/OpenSource hardware+software stack!</p><p>

I don't own or otherwise control a silicon foundry, and therefore can't fabricate my own ASICs, so I will build the "hardware" component of this computer on an FPGA, ensuring that any programming of (and bitstream generation for) the FPGA happens with Free/OpenSource tools. I consider the tradeoff to be worthwhile and advantageous from a trustworthiness standpoint:
  </p><ul>
  <li>The chip foundry wouldn't know what the FPGA will be used for, and where the proverbial "privilege bit" will end up being laid out on the chip, which mitigates against Privilege Escalation hardware backdoors. Exposure is limited to DoS attacks being planted into the silicon during FPGA fabrication, which yields a significantly improved level of assurance (i.e., the computer may stop working altogether, but can't betray its owner to an adversary while <i>pretending</i> to operate correctly).
  </li><li>The FPGA is a regular grid of identical components, so (destructive) visual inspection (i.e., chemical ablation and TEM imaging) is more feasible than with a dedicated ASIC that has much less visual regularity and repeatability.
  </li><li>Having thus constrained the fabrication-stage attack surface, I can cover the remaining hardware attack vectors (malicious sources and/or toolchain) by insisting on buildable sources to <i>everything</i>, resulting in a finished product (i.e., deployed hardware+software computer) that is <i>as trustowrthy as</i> its <i>openly auditable</i> HDL+Software sources.
  </li></ul><p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>As I'm exploring the fantastic world of indie game development lately, I end up
watching a large number of video tutorials on the subject. Even though the
quality of the content is pretty variable, I'm very grateful to the creators
for it. That being said, I couldn't help noticing this particular bit times and
times again:</p>
<pre><code>a = lerp(a, B, delta * RATE)
</code></pre>
<p>Behind this apparent banal call hides a terrible curse, forever perpetrated by
innocent souls on the Internet.</p>
<p>In this article we will study what it's trying to achieve, how it works, why
it's wrong, and then we'll come up with a good solution to the initial problem.</p>
<p>The usual warning: I don't have a mathematics or academic background, so the
article is addressed at other neanderthals like myself, who managed to
understand that pressing keys on a keyboard make pixels turn on and off.</p>
<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>Let's start from the beginning. We're in a game engine main loop callback
called at a regular interval (roughly), passing down the time difference from
the last call.</p>
<p>In Godot engine, it looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>func _physics_process(delta: float):
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>If the game is configured to refresh at 60 FPS, we can expect this function to
be called around 60 times per second with <code>delta = 1/60 = 0.01666...</code>.</p>
<p>As a game developer, we want some smooth animations for all kind of
transformations. For example, we may want the speed of the player to go down to
zero as they release the moving key. We could do that linearly, but to make the
stop less brutal and robotic we want to slow down the speed progressively.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://blog.pkh.me/img/fixing-damp/lin-vs-exp.gif" alt="linear vs exponential GIF">
  <figcaption>Linear (top) versus smooth/exponential (bottom) animation</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Virtually every tutorial will suggest updating some random variable with
something like that:</p>
<pre><code>velocity = lerp(velocity, 0, delta * RATE)
</code></pre>
<p>At 60 FPS, a decay <code>RATE</code> defined to <code>3.5</code>, and an initial <code>velocity</code> of <code>100</code>,
the <code>velocity</code> will go down to <code>0</code> following this curve:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://blog.pkh.me/img/fixing-damp/velocity-curve.png" alt="velocity curve">
  <figcaption>Example curve of a decaying variable</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: <code>velocity</code> is just a variable name example, it can be found in many
other contexts</p>
<p>If you're familiar with <code>lerp()</code> ("linear interpolation") you may be wondering
why this is making a curve. Indeed, this <code>lerp()</code> function, also known as
<code>mix()</code>, is a simple linear function defined as <code>lerp(a,b,x) = x*(b-a) + a</code> or
its alternative stable form <code>lerp(a,b,x) = (1-a)x + bx</code>. For more information,
see a <a href="https://blog.pkh.me/p/29-the-most-useful-math-formulas.html">previous article</a> about this particular function. But here
we are re-using the previous value, so this essentially means nesting <code>lerp()</code>
function calls, which expands into a power formula, forming a curve composed of
a chain of small straight segments.</p>
<h2>Why is it wrong?</h2>
<p>The main issue is that the formula is heavily depending on the refresh rate. If
the game is supposed to work at 30, 60, or 144 FPS, then it means the physics
engine is going to behave differently.</p>
<p>Here is an illustration of the kind of instability we can expect:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://blog.pkh.me/img/fixing-damp/problematic-formula.png" alt="problematic formula">
  <figcaption>Comparison of the curves at different frame rates with the problematic formula</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Note that the inaccuracy when compared to an ideal curve is not the issue here.
The problem is that the game mechanics are different depending on the hardware,
the system, and the wind direction observed in a small island of Japan. Imagine
being able to jump further if we replace our 60Hz monitor with a 144Hz one,
that would be some nasty pay to win incentive.</p>
<p>We may be able to get away with this by forcing a constant refresh rate for the
game and consider this a non-issue (I'm not convinced this is achievable on all
engines and platforms), but then we meet another problem: the device may not be
able to hold this requirement at all times because of potential lags (for
reasons that may be outside our control). That's right, so far we assumed
<code>delta=1/FPS</code> but that's merely a target, it could fluctuate, causing mild to
dramatic situations gameplay wise.</p>
<p>One last issue with that formula is the situation of a huge delay spike,
causing an overshooting of the target. For example if we have <code>RATE=3</code> and we
end up with a frame that takes 500ms for whatever random reason, we're going to
interpolate with a value of 1.5, which is way above 1. This is easily fixed by
maxing out the 3rd argument of <code>lerp</code> to 1, but we have to keep that issue in
mind.</p>
<p>To summarize, the formula is:</p>
<ol>
<li>not frame rate agnostic ❌</li>
<li>non deterministic ❌</li>
<li>vulnerable to overshooting ❌</li>
</ol>
<p>If you're not interested in the gory details on the <em>how</em>, you can now jump
straight to the conclusion for a better alternative.</p>
<h2>Study</h2>
<p>We're going to switch to a more mathematical notation from now on. It's only
going to be linear algebra, nothing particularly fancy, but we're going to make
a mess of 1 letter symbols, bear with me.</p>
<p>Let's name the exhaustive list of inputs of our problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>initial value: <span>a_0=\Alpha</span> (from where we start, only used once)</li>
<li>target value: <span>\Beta</span> (where we are going, constant value)</li>
<li>time delta: <span>\Delta_n</span> (time difference from last call)</li>
<li>the rate of change: <span>R</span> (arbitrary scaling user constant)</li>
<li>original sequence: <span>a_{n+1} = \texttt{lerp}(a_n, \Beta, R\Delta_n)</span> (the code in the main
loop callback)</li>
<li>frame rate: <span>F</span> (the target frame rate, for example <span>60</span> FPS)</li>
<li>time: <span>t</span> (animation time elapsed)</li>
</ul>
<p>What we are looking for is a new sequence formula <span>u_n</span> (<span>u</span> standing for
<em>purfect</em>) that doesn't have the 3 previously mentioned pitfalls.</p>
<p>The first thing we can do is to transform this recursive sequence into the
expected ideal contiguous time based function. The original sequence was
designed for a given rate <span>R</span> and FPS <span>F</span>: this means that while <span>\Delta_n</span>
changes in practice every frame, the ideal function we are looking for is
constant: <span>\Delta=1/F</span>.</p>
<p>So instead of starting from <span>a_{n+1} = \texttt{lerp}(a_n, \Beta, R\Delta_n)</span>,
we will look for <span>u_n</span> starting from <span>u_{n+1} = \texttt{lerp}(u_n, \Beta,
R\Delta)</span> with <span>u_0=a_0=\Alpha</span>.</p>
<p>Since I'm lazy and incompetent, we are just going to ask WolframAlpha for help
finding the solution to the recursive sequence. But to feed its input we need
to simplify the terms a bit:</p>
<p>
\begin{split}
u_{n+1} &amp;= \texttt{lerp}(u_n, \Beta, R\Delta) \\
      &amp;= u_n(1-R\Delta) + \Beta R\Delta \\
      &amp;= u_nP + Q
\end{split}
</p>
<p>...with <span>P=(1-R\Delta)</span> and <span>Q=\Beta R\Delta</span>. We do that so we have a familiar <span>ax+b</span> linear form.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=u%280%29%3DA+and+u%28n%2B1%29%3Du%28n%29*P%2BQ">According to WolframAlpha</a> this is equivalent to:</p>
<p>
u_n = \Alpha P^n + \frac{Q(P^n-1)}{P-1}
</p>
<p>This is great because we now have the formula according to <span>n</span>, our frame
number. We can also express that discrete sequence into a contiguous function
according to the time <span>t</span>:</p>
<p>
f(t) = \Alpha P^{tF} + \frac{Q(P^{tF}-1)}{P-1}
</p>
<p>Expanding our temporary <span>P</span> and <span>Q</span> placeholders with their values and
unrolling, we get:</p>
<p>
\begin{split}
f(t) &amp;= AP^{tF} + \frac{Q(P^{tF}-1)}{P-1} \\
     &amp;= A(1-R\Delta)^{tF} + \frac{\Beta R\Delta((1-R\Delta)^{tF}-1)}{(1-R\Delta)-1} \\
     &amp;= A(1-R\Delta)^{tF} - \Beta((1-R\Delta)^{tF}-1) \\
     &amp;= A(1-R\Delta)^{tF} + \Beta(1-(1-R\Delta)^{tF}) \\
     &amp;= \texttt{lerp}(\Beta, \Alpha, (1-R\Delta)^{tF}) \\
     &amp;= \texttt{lerp}(\Beta, \Alpha, (1-R/F)^{tF}) \\
f(t) &amp;= \boxed{\texttt{lerp}(\Alpha, \Beta, 1-(1-R/F)^{tF})}
\end{split}
</p>
<p>This function perfectly matches the initial <code>lerp()</code> sequence in the
hypothetical situation where the frame rate is honored. Basically, it's <strong>what
the sequence <span>a_{n+1}</span> was meant to emulate at a given frame rate <span>F</span></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: we swapped the first 2 terms of <code>lerp()</code> at the last step because it
makes more sense semantically to go from <span>\Alpha</span> to <span>\Beta</span>.</p>
<p>Let's again summarize what we have and what we want: we're into the game main
loop and we want our running value to stick to that <span>f(t)</span> function. We
have:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>v=f(t)</span>: the value previously computed (<span>t</span> is the running duration so far,
but we don't have it); in the original sequence this is known as <span>a_n</span></li>
<li><span>\Delta_n</span>: the delta time for the current frame</li>
</ul>
<p>We are looking for a function <span>\Eta(v,\Delta_n)</span> which defines the position of
a new point on the curve, only knowing <span>v</span> and <span>\Delta_n</span>. It's a "time
agnostic" version of <span>f(t)</span>.</p>
<p>Basically, it is defined as <span>\Eta(v,\Delta_n)=f(t+\Delta_n)</span>, but since we don't have
<span>t</span> it's not very helpful. That being said, while we don't have <span>t</span>, we do have
<span>f(t)</span> (the previous value <span>v</span>).</p>
<p>Looking at the curve, we know the y-value of the previous point, and we know
the difference between the new point and the previous point on the x-axis:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://blog.pkh.me/img/fixing-damp/prev-to-current-curve.png" alt="previous to current point">
  <figcaption>Previous and current point in time</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If we want <span>t</span> (the total time elapsed at the previous point), we need the
inverse function <span>f^{-1}</span>. Indeed, <span>t = f^{-1}(f(t))</span>: taking the inverse of a
function gives back the input. We know <span>f</span> so we can inverse it, relying on
WolframAlpha again (what a blessing this website is):</p>
<p>
f^{-1}(x) = \frac{\ln{\frac{\Beta-x}{\Beta-\Alpha}}}{F \ln(1-R/F)}
</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: <span>\ln</span> stands for natural logarithm, sometimes also called <span>\log</span>.
Careful though, on Desmos for example <span>\log</span> is in base 10, not base <span>e</span> (while
its <span>\exp</span> is in base <span>e</span> for some reason).</p>
<p>This complex formula may feel a bit intimidating but we can now find <span>\Eta</span>
only using its two parameters:</p>
<p>
\begin{split}
\Eta(v,\Delta_n) &amp;= f(t + \Delta_n) \\
                &amp;= f(f^{-1}(f(t)) + \Delta_n) \\
                &amp;= f(f^{-1}(v) + \Delta_n) \\
                &amp;= f(\frac{\ln{\frac{\Beta-v}{\Beta-\Alpha}}}{F \ln(1-R/F)} + \Delta_n) \\
                &amp;= \texttt{lerp}(\Alpha, \Beta, 1-(1-R/F)^{(\frac{\ln{\frac{\Beta-v}{\Beta-\Alpha}}}{F \ln(1-R/F)} + \Delta_n) \times F}) \\
                &amp;= \texttt{lerp}(\Alpha, \Beta, 1-(1-R/F)^{\frac{\ln{\frac{\Beta-v}{\Beta-\Alpha}}}{\ln(1-R/F)}} (1-R/F)^{F\Delta_n}) \\
                &amp;= \texttt{lerp}(\Alpha, \Beta, 1-\frac{\Beta-v}{\Beta-\Alpha} (1-R/F)^{F\Delta_n}) \\
                &amp;= (1-\frac{\Beta-v}{\Beta-\Alpha} (1-R/F)^{F\Delta_n})(\Beta-\Alpha) + A \\
                &amp;= (\Beta-\Alpha) - (\Beta-v) (1-R/F)^{F\Delta_n} + A \\
                &amp;= (v-\Beta)(1-R/F)^{F\Delta_n} + \Beta \\
                &amp;= \texttt{lerp}(\Beta, v, (1-R/F)^{F\Delta_n}) \\
\Eta(v,\Delta_n) &amp;= \texttt{lerp}(v, \Beta, 1-(1-R/F)^{F\Delta_n})
\end{split}
</p>
<p>Again we swapped the first 2 arguments of <code>lerp</code> at the last step at the cost
of an additional subtraction: this is more readable because <span>\Beta</span> is our
destination point.</p>
<p>An interesting property that is going to be helpful here is <span>m^n = e^{n
\ln{m}}</span>. For my fellow programmers getting tensed here: <code>pow(m, n) == exp(n * log(m))</code>. Replacing the power with the exponential may not seem like an
improvement at first, but it allows packing all the constant terms together:</p>
<p>
\begin{split}
\Eta(v,\Delta_n) &amp;= \texttt{lerp}(v, \Beta, 1-(1-R/F)^{F\Delta_n}) \\
                &amp;= \texttt{lerp}(v, \Beta, 1-e^{F\ln(1-R/F)\Delta_n})
\end{split}
</p>
<p><span>F\ln(1-R/F)</span> can be pre-computed because it is constant: it's our <strong>rate
conversion formula</strong>, which we can extract:</p>
<p>
\begin{split}
             R' &amp;= F\ln(1-R/F) \\
\Eta(v,\Delta_n) &amp;= \texttt{lerp}(v, \Beta, 1-e^{R'\Delta_n})
\end{split}
</p>
<p>Rewriting this in a sequence notation, we get:</p>
<p>
\begin{split}
  R' &amp;= F\ln(1-R/F) \\
u_{n+1} &amp;= \texttt{lerp}(u_n, \Beta, 1-e^{R'\Delta_n})
\end{split}
</p>
<p>We're going to make one last adjustment: <span>R'</span> is negative, which is not
exactly intuitive to work with as a user (in case it is defined arbitrarily and
not through the conversion formula), so we make a sign swap for convenience:</p>
<p>
\boxed{\begin{split}
  R' &amp;= -F\ln(1-R/F) \\
u_{n+1} &amp;= \texttt{lerp}(u_n, \Beta, 1-e^{-R'\Delta_n})
\end{split}}
</p>
<p>The conversion formula is optional, it's only needed to port a previously
broken code to the new formula. One interesting thing here is that <span>R'</span> is
fairly close to <span>R</span> when <span>R</span> is small.</p>
<p>For example, a rate factor <span>R=5</span> at 60 FPS gives us <span>R' \approx 5.22</span>. This
means that if the rate factors weren't closely tuned, it is probably acceptable
to go with <span>R'=R</span> and not bother with any conversion. Still, having that
formula can be useful to update all the decay constants and check that
everything still works as expected.</p>
<p>Also, notice how if the delta gets very large, <span>-R'\Delta_n</span> is going toward
<span>-\infty</span>, <span>e^{-R'\Delta_n}</span> toward <span>0</span>, <span>1-e^{-R'\Delta_n}</span> toward <span>1</span>, and so
the interpolation is going to reach our final target <span>\Beta</span> without
overshooting. This means the formula doesn't need any extra care with regard to
the 3rd issue we pointed out earlier.</p>
<p>Looking at the previous curves but now with the new formula and an adjusted
rate:</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>So there we have it, the perfect formula, frame rate agnostic ✅,
deterministic ✅ and resilient to overshooting ✅. If you've quickly skimmed
through the maths, here is what you need to know:</p>
<pre><code>a = lerp(a, B, delta * RATE)
</code></pre>
<p>Should be changed to:</p>
<pre><code>a = lerp(a, B, 1.0 - exp(-delta * RATE2))
</code></pre>
<p>With the precomputed <code>RATE2 = -FPS * log(1 - RATE/FPS)</code> (where <code>log</code> is the
natural logarithm), or simply using <code>RATE2 = RATE</code> as a rough equivalent.</p>
<p>Also, any existing overshooting clamping can safely be dropped.</p>
<p>Now please adjust your game to make the world a better and safer place for
everyone ♥</p>
<h2>Going further</h2>
<p>As <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40401152">suggested on HN</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>for numerical stability it makes sense to <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/cpp_expm1/">use <code>-expm1(x)</code></a> instead of
<code>1-exp(x)</code></li>
<li>API wise, proposing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_smoothing#Time_constant">time constant</a> <code>T</code> instead of the rate (where
<code>T=1/rate</code>) might be more intuitive</li>
<li>for performance reasons, the exponential could be expanded manually to
<code>x+x²/2</code> for small value of <code>x</code></li>
</ul>
