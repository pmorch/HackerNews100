        <p dir="auto">Over the years, I have received many proposals to monetize this extension so I think I'll just start posting them here for fun (but not for profit). The main reason I continue to maintain this extension is because I can hardly trust others to not fall for one of these offers. I'm fortunate to have a job that pays well enough to allow me to keep my moral compass and ignore all of these propositions. I realize that not everyone has the same financial security so hopefully this thread would shed some light on what kind of pressure is put on extension developers.</p>
<h3 dir="auto">09/28/2015</h3>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Hope this message finds you well.</p>
<p dir="auto">My name is <em>redacted</em> and I’m a Strategic Partnerships Manager at <em>redacted</em> - monetization platform for browser extensions.</p>
<p dir="auto">I am contacting you since I came across the extension 'Hover Zoom+' at Chrome Store; I consider your product can help you bring profit by means of collaborating together.</p>
<p dir="auto">I would like to suggest a potential partnership between our companies that will significantly increase your revenues.</p>
<p dir="auto">Are you interested in discussing our offer in more details?</p>
<p dir="auto">Hope for positive feedback and ongoing cooperation.</p>

<h3 dir="auto">06/17/2015</h3>

<p dir="auto">Please forgive my persistence, I’m following up to an email I sent to you last week in regards to your Chrome browser extension.  I am still interested in speaking with you about monetizing your anonymous user data.</p>
<p dir="auto">There are a couple things I want to insure you know.</p>
<p dir="auto">Monetizing anonymous user data is happening on almost every website we visit - you may be leaving alot of money on the table by not monetizing your anonymous user data.  Try dowloading Ghostry to see for yourself.<br>
Affiliate commissions may pay you as much as 20% but is not always scaleable.<br>
Chrome will deactive extenions that violate their ‘single purpose’ policy by working with ad injection companies - <em>redacted</em> does not, will not inject ads, but uses anonymous user data to provide more relevant advertising through NAI and IAB approved ad delivery networks.<br>
Top advertisers across all verticals are very interested in targeting high quality intent data derived from browser extensions.</p>
<p dir="auto">Again, if your data is strong, it has the potential to produce a significant new revenue stream for you and your business.  Here is a link to our self-serve Developer Dashboard: <em>redacted</em></p>
<p dir="auto">I’d be happy to provide additional information should you have any questions.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 dir="auto">04/26/2016</h3>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">My name is <em>redacted</em>, I’m a co-founder and CEO of <em>redacted</em> – a Market intelligence service for ecommerce. (like similarweb, only for ecommerce).</p>
<p dir="auto">We are revolutionizing the way ecommerce data is being generated and consumed</p>
<p dir="auto">We are building a user panel of several of millions of users worldwide and are looking for top quality partners with substantial user base to enhance our panel.</p>
<p dir="auto">We are working in a very similar manner to <em>redacted</em>, providing you with an easy to integrate SDK to collect anonymous data.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you are already working with <em>redacted</em>’s SDK the integration should take no more than a couple of minutes.<br>
There is no collision with any other monetization tool you might be working with today.<br>
Our SDK holds no monetization or any other form of user interaction and it does not interfere with the user experience.</p>
<p dir="auto">It is also important to state that we collect no personal data and only store information relevant for online shopping trends.</p>
<p dir="auto">We can help you monetize your extension in a simple and non-intrusive manner.</p>
<p dir="auto">I would like to discuss potential integration with you and see how we can work together.</p>
<p dir="auto">Will you be available today/tomorrow for a short call to explain things?</p>

<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">I’m sure you get business proposals all the time, so I’ll get straight to the point. I hope what I’m proposing is a little different and might actually interest you. I like Hover Zoom+ as a great alternative to it’s bigger brother Hover Zoom that lost its glamour over the last couple of months.</p>
<p dir="auto">We're conducting a DNS error research and we’re interested in small amounts of anonymous data that you might be able to provide via your Chrome extension. Our research has been going on for years and Google has never had the slightest problem with it.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Compatible with Google’s strict policies</li>
<li>No personal user data</li>
<li>No ads, no malware</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The data we’re interested in are basically just DNS errors:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>NXD – Non Existent Domain - the domain that a user entered that resulted in a DNS error.</li>
<li>A time stamp – when it happened.</li>
<li>GEO – where it happened (USA, UK, RU etc.).</li>
<li>A unique randomly generated user ID (can be hashed, not traceable back to the user). Please, don’t confuse this with the user IP address.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">And that’s all. You can either use our script or collect the data on your own and send it to us via an FTP server, API etc. There’s a lot of different ways we can do this. We pay on a monthly basis. The payments depend on user GEOs, but it would be in thousands of dollars per year.</p>
<p dir="auto">Is this worth at least a brief discussion? Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">A while back I reached out to you regarding a DNS error research our company conducts. Hover Zoom+ would be an ideal medium for our research. In return, this could become a solid new revenue stream for you.</p>
<p dir="auto">Our method has been going on for years and we’ve never had the slightest problem with Google. We pay regularly on a monthly basis. For you it would be in tens of thousands of dollars per year - the amount depends on your users base and data quality.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you’re concerned about including third party scripts, there’s still a lot of ways we can make this work.</p>
<p dir="auto">Please let me know if this is worth a brief discussion to you.</p>

<p dir="auto">I'm <em>redacted</em>, regional manager of <em>redacted</em> advertisement network.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>redacted</em> is PopUnder ad network operating since 2015.  We are currently offering your extension/plugin a private deal with advanced payments for CPM / impressions, and we are ready to discuss the prices so that our offer could be more profitable for you.</p>
<p dir="auto">PopUnder is different from PopUp and other types of online ads. PopUnder opens in a new tab/window in one click. The ad appears as a separate tab or window behind the main browser window (that is why it’s called PopUnder) and doesn’t have a negative impact on the user’s perception of the website and user experience. PopUnder doesn’t distract the user from your website. All technical settings (number of clicks, time etc) are open to discussion.</p>
<p dir="auto">Just to see how PopUnder operates you can try our demo: <em>redacted</em>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Advertisements correspond with your target audience so that you monetize your site to the fullest extent. You will decide how often PopUnder ads  will appear. The ads can be moderated and you can disable or remove any kind of advertisement you dislike.</p>
<p dir="auto">Our ads are currently running on: <em>redacted</em></p>
<p dir="auto">Our platform comprises 3000+ advertisers.</p>
<p dir="auto">The main ad categories are e-commerce (online shopping), software, gaming.</p>
<p dir="auto">Please download our presentation: <em>redacted</em></p>
<p dir="auto">I am always ready to answer any questions and receive other feedback on our cooperation via email <em>redacted</em> or Skype –<em>redacted</em>.</p>

Our partners have gained access to a new and simple revenue stream without interfering with your user experience or gathering PII. We consider partners and their users to be long term strategic relationships.  In some instances, we've also acquired extensions where it made sense for both sides.</p>

<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">I am contacting you regarding your browser extension (I love the simplicity of it :) ). I think there is an opportunity for a cooperation between us.</p>
<p dir="auto">I’ve developed <em>redacted</em> – an extension that lets users support highly effective, research-backed charities while shopping online (with no extra costs).

Celebrating holidays — </span><em>all holidays</em><span> — and spreading a little joy and cheer from the company (and reminding people how cool Linux is in the process).  So much fun.</span></p><p><span>The one thing we had never done, as a company, is make any mention of any Jewish holiday.  Not once, </span><em><strong>not ever</strong></em><span>.</span></p><p>Well, no big deal.</p><p>Being a Jewish man, I can come up with something easily enough!  So, in 2015, I drafted and published a very small “Happy Hanukkah” post that went out on SUSE Social Media (which I controlled 100% of for many years).</p><p>It was short, simple, pleasant.</p><p>Immediately after, I received instruction (handed down from the head of Marketing, a few steps above me on the totem pole, at SUSE) to delete the “Happy Hanukkah” posts.</p><p><span>I was also instructed — explicitly — to leave all content related to every other holiday (Christmas, etc.) online.  </span><strong>The only holiday that was to be removed was the Jewish one.</strong></p><p>So I did what any good little corporate boy would do… I deleted the posts that sounded a bit too “Jew-y”.  And left all the other holiday content in place.  As instructed.  Did it make me happy as Jew?  No.  It did not.</p><blockquote><p><span>Fun side note: Within mere </span><em><strong>minutes</strong></em><span> of deleting all of the content that referenced a Jewish holiday… an email went out to SUSE employees.  Encouraging us all to sing Christmas carols.  At the company office.  Not joking.</span></p></blockquote><p>Right about now you might be thinking to yourself, “SUSE — a German company — is forbidding the mentioning of Jewish holidays?  That’s not a good look.”  And, well, you wouldn’t be alone in having that thought.</p><p>Obviously I raised a concern about this through the proper channels within SUSE.</p><p>My immediate manager did the right thing… and raised my concerns up the chain of command.</p><p><strong>That manager was promptly fired</strong><span>.  And, needless to say, the issue was not addressed.</span></p><p>A new manager was hired for my team.  After a short period of time, I brought up the whole “SUSE bans mentioning of Jews” issue to this manager as well.  And, once again, my manager did the right thing and raised the issue up the chain of command.</p><p><strong>That manager was, also, promptly fired.</strong></p><p>At which point the head of SUSE Marketing — who issued the “No Jewish Holidays” rule, was given a significant promotion.</p><blockquote><p><span>This is a good moment to mention how </span><em><strong>crazy good</strong></em><span> my performance within SUSE was.  Not only was I the most recognized name and face within the company… I was personally responsible for starting, writing, and driving some of the most successful campaigns in SUSE history.  SUSE’s financial results reflect my insanely good performance.  Literally off the chart.</span></p></blockquote><p>So, what happened next?  I was reprimanded and moved off my team.  Then denied a promised pay raise.  At which point multiple false statements (provably so) were made about me internally by upper management.</p><p>In short:</p><p><strong>The Jew that raised concerns about the German Linux company discriminating against Jews?  Punished.  Significantly.  And any manager that inquired about the discrimination was quickly fired.</strong></p><p>I stayed with the company.  I wanted to make it work.</p><p>So I raised the issue again.  To everyone in the chain of command — all the way up to the CEO.</p><p><span>To my delight, investigation was started.  Huzzah!  </span><em><strong>An investigation!  </strong></em><span>With how extensively everything was documented, surely this would help resolve the issue!</span></p><p><span>After the investigation drug on for what seemed like an eternity, I was eventually informed that no discrimination, </span><em>of any kind</em><span>, had occurred.</span></p><p><em><strong>Say, what now?!</strong></em></p><p>The evidence of discrimination was overwhelming.  The documentation (including emails detailing everything) was extensive and verifiable.  In fact, SUSE never (not once) disagreed with any of the facts… they simply didn’t think what they did was wrong.  (Even though it is under both US and German law.)</p><p>Obviously, I asked to see the results of the investigation — because, clearly, something was wrong here.  Something shady was happening.  I was told, point blank, that I would not be shown any notes or information from the investigation.  Period.  No exceptions.</p><p>No apology for discriminating against Jews.  Nor for discriminating against, and punishing, me.  Nobody that committed (the well documented) discrimination was disciplined in any way (in fact, they were promoted and praised).</p><p>I was told that I simply needed to be happy about it.</p><p>The annual conference for SUSE is known as SUSECON.</p><p>And me, being the person that controlled all of SUSE social media (and being the most high profile face within the company)… I kinda needed to be there.</p><p><span>SUSECON was schedule to occur… during the Jewish High Holy Days (the week between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur).  With the closing event occurring on Yom Kippur… the holiest day of the year.  A day when Jews absolutely </span><em><strong>do not work</strong></em><span>.</span></p><p>The management of SUSE knew all of this.  I know they knew all this… because we had talked about it many times.</p><p>And they certainly knew I was Jewish (see this entire article up until now).</p><p>There are two possibilities here:</p><ol><li><p>This was done on purpose, with malice, directed at me and the other Jewish employees of SUSE.</p></li><li><p>This was done with profound disregard for Jewish employees of SUSE.</p></li></ol><p>Those are the only two options.  Because I also know that many other dates were on the table that worked better.</p><p>Think about this for a moment…</p><blockquote><p>What if SUSECON had been scheduled on Christmas morning?</p><p>What if a devout Christian was told to delete ALL content that mentioned Christmas… but leave all Jewish and Islamic content online (and then even make more of it)?</p><p>What if that Christian raised this as an issue and then was reprimanded, passed over for raises, moved out of his/her team?</p><p>What if every manager of that Christian was fired right after raising the issue internally?</p><p>What if that Christian was told "we looked into it and it's all fine, you're wrong, go back to work... and we won't tell you details of our investigation"...?&nbsp;</p><p>Replace the word "Christian" with "Muslim", "LGBT", etc.  How does that read to you?</p><p>Classic, obvious, well documented, text book discrimination.</p></blockquote><p>What is truly mind-blowing to me: is that SUSE leadership knowingly did all of this… even though it hurt the company tremendously.</p><p>What does that suggest?  That discriminating against Jews — or covering up the fact that some of their employees had done so — was more important to SUSE than achieving corporate goals.</p><p>As time went on I began hearing more and more stories like mine.</p><p>Times when SUSE did things (sometimes large, sometimes small) that made Jews within the company feel uncomfortable.  Sometimes far more than simply “uncomfortable”.</p><p>I can’t speak for those people.  Those stories are theirs to tell.  But I have independently corroborated some of them.  And, should those individuals ever choose to speak out, I will be available to provide supporting documentation and support.</p><p>Despite all of this… I kept trying to fix things internally.</p><p>I didn’t speak about the discrimination publicly.  Despite me having a large platform — and despite the fact that I, specifically, report on Linux companies… I kept quiet.  In part out of a sense of loyalty to my friends within the company… and a genuine affection for the SUSE brand (it is the oldest Linux company, after all).</p><p><span>After </span><em><strong>years</strong></em><span> of attempting to resolve the issue… to help SUSE stop discriminating against Jews… </span></p><p>In 2017, after months of SUSE intimidating me into silence… including what I perceived as threats from their lawyers, I agreed to leave the company and not talk about these issues publicly.  They made sure I was afraid to tell my story.</p><blockquote><p><span>Just to drive home how high profile I was within the company — and how valuable I was for them — </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lunduke-makes-return-to-journalism-300554544.html" rel="">SUSE had to issue a press release when I left</a><span>.  That sort of thing is usually only done for departing CEOs.</span></p><p>My coworkers asked me to supply a quote for the press release… and I did so.  Begrudgingly and under more than a little duress.  A quote that was about as vague as you can get (and certainly did not address the real reason for my departure).</p></blockquote><p><span>Agreeing to not talk about these issues was a profound mistake on my part.  What I should have done is to </span><em>immediately</em><span> (once it was clear that SUSE would not fix their problems) tell the whole world what SUSE did.  And, quite honestly, SUSE should not have pressured me into agreeing to such a thing.  Their actions were deeply unethical.  And cruel.</span></p><p>It is now 2022.  The fifth year since SUSE threatened me into silence and, effectively, forced me out of the company.</p><p>In the years since, SUSE has changed hands and gotten a new CEO.</p><p>After the new CEO was appointed, I reached out to her.  In a kind way, I let her know that I had been forced to leave the company after discrimination against Jews (and a policy of forbidding public discussion of Jews).  And that I wanted her to be aware of the past issues so that she could make sure they don’t happen to others going forward.</p><p>The new CEO of SUSE responded by blocking me on Twitter.</p><p>Which was weird.</p><blockquote><p>Later, after I called the SUSE CEO on the strangeness of being blocked… she unblocked me.  Still.  Quite odd.</p></blockquote><p>Why do I bring all of this up now — nearly 5 years later?</p><p>Because this last week I spoke to someone at SUSE… who let me know of similar, current, goings on within the company.  And I want people within SUSE, who may be currently being discriminated against because they are Jewish, to know that they are not alone.  And that if they need help in telling their stories… I am here.</p><p>I am not a litigious man.  I operate under the simple notion that sunlight is the best disinfectant.</p><p>Would I like an apology?  You bet.  That would be nice (and certainly warranted).</p><p>Do I expect one?  No.  I do not.</p><p>If me publishing my own, personal, story of discrimination simply helps to put a stop to any possible future discrimination of Jews (or anyone else for that matter)?  That’ll be a good result.</p><blockquote><p>“Aren’t you afraid that SUSE will come after you, legally, because you told your story of discrimination?”</p></blockquote><p>Yes.  I am.  Very much so.</p><p>When I was forced out of SUSE, it was made clear to me that they would not allow me to tell other people what they had done.  (Which is funny, considering they also told me that what they had done was not a bad thing… if their actions are not bad… why would they not want people to know about it?)</p><p>What I have written here is (part of) my personal story.

I am not seeking to harm anyone’s career (even those who sought to harm mine because I am Jewish).  I am not asking for anyone to be punished or fired in any way.</p><p>I tried to work with SUSE for multiple years to fix what they did.  Then I waited for half a decade, after leaving the company, to see some sort of attempt to make up for it.  Not only have I put forth a tremendous amount of (good faith) effort to help SUSE… I also gave the company many, many years more time than they needed to make amends.</p><p>What would be wonderful: If SUSE wants to reach out to me to help them to make sure they don’t discriminate against Jews going forward… I would gladly offer my advice to them and applaud them for taking a positive step forward.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

    <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Hi HN! We’re the co-founders of Refine (<a href="https://github.com/refinedev/refine">https://github.com/refinedev/refine</a>), an open-source platform for developing enterprise web applications rapidly. In one year since launch we have 15K active developers each month, and over 5K projects in production. Among the 5,000+ projects deployed to production, we see a lot of admin panels, dashboards, B2B portals and SAAS interfaces.</p><p>Check out our online generator at (<a href="https://refine.dev/#playground">https://refine.dev/#playground</a>) to create a custom Refine application and download it.</p><p>Before starting refine, we spent five years as a consultancy company building internal-facing applications for enterprise clients. We have seen many complex use cases where the demanded flexibility was much higher than what existing low-code/no-code solutions provide. Moving away from rigid architectures and pre-made components that are difficult to customize, developers tend to start from the scratch. This results in a significant waste of time and resources.</p><p>In order to find a sweet spot between “starting from scratch” and higher level solutions,  we started working on refine. After a couple of iterations, we came up with a “headless” solution, separating the UI-layer completely from the rest of the frontend logic. This allowed us to support multiple UI frameworks and custom designs out of the box.</p><p>We understand the importance of frontend developers working with the stack and tools they love and are familiar with. So, we have built our project creation wizard that allows developers to mix and match their technology stack when creating a project.</p><p>After 1.5 years of development with the great support of the open-source community, Refine has become a mature framework that allows developers to rapidly build enterprise applications and have 100% control over their projects.</p><p>While remaining unobtrusive, Refine still saves a lot of development resources by eliminating repetitive tasks such as CRUD operations, state management, routing, authentication, access control, and i18n. It’s also backend-agnostic and works with any APIs or services.</p><p>The best way to start Refine development is visiting our extensive documentation at (<a href="https://refine.dev/docs/">https://refine.dev/docs/</a>). Here, you can also find tutorials and real-life examples to use as a starting point for your use case.</p><p>We had one successful Show HN earlier this year (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34515128">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34515128</a>), and have since had several major releases and added many more features.</p><p>Recently, we've released our enterprise edition featuring deployments, built-in security, backend integrations and auto-generated UI's. By expanding Refine's capabilities beyond the frontend, the enterprise edition offers a complete solution for the internal tooling requirements of larger organizations. To get more information, please see our pricing page: <a href="https://refine.dev/pricing/">https://refine.dev/pricing/</a>.</p><p>If you have any questions, ideas or suggestions please share them with us. The team will be here all day to answer. We look forward to all of your comments!</p></div></td></tr>        <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><form action="comment" method="post"></form></td></tr>  </tbody></table>

<p>Looking at crash stats I'll note that of ~200 crashes, 95% are coming from Samsung mobiles. Almost all the samsung crashes have crash addresses ended in <code>fa9</code> -- which feels important but I'm not sure what it means; they all appear to come to the same build IDs. Looking at the registers, there's a register with the crashing address (but aligned, ending in <code>fa8</code>). Unfortunately I can't see what instruction is being used to do the load, so I'm not sure if this is like 1-past the end of a buffer or if we're doing an unaligned load where we ought to not be.</p>
<p>There's also a series of crashes at <code>0x0000087c</code>, all with the same install time (2023-05-09 17:49:58) -- these can be disregarded as bad hardware I suspect.</p>
<p><a href="https://crash-stats.mozilla.org/report/index/466b9608-946e-4b12-99c7-3e4050230514" rel="nofollow">At least one of these crashes from windows is pretty suspicious</a>. As much as the stack looks very real, it's reporting a <code>MOZ_RELEASE_ASSERT(pn_type &lt; ParseNodeKind::Limit)</code>, which is not used particularly nearby; it's unclear why this is the case.</p>

<p>So the unaligned access of <code>x10+1</code> is coming directly from the assembly. The origin of that value is <code>x19+ x12 &lt;&lt; 3</code> (previous instruction). Sure enough, doing this calculation using the values from one of the dumps seems to confirm that what I'm seeing is real:</p>
<pre><code>js&gt; (0x000000700d6711d8 + (0x00000000ffffffba &lt;&lt; 3)).toString(16)
'700d670fa8'
</code></pre>
</div><div id="c8" data-comment-id="16426217" data-ismarkdown="true"><p>Best guess is that these instructions are implementing</p>
<pre><code>   JSOp op = JSOp(*pc);
  int nuses = CodeSpec(op).nuses;
</code></pre>
<p>from <code>js::StackUses</code></p>
<p>Reading the back trace, it seems like we're emitting either a GetAliasedVar or GetAliasedDebugVar; we then call into <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-release/file/8141476bccc7d2e2468b740df03954d6ab212248/js/src/frontend/BytecodeEmitter.cpp#l369" rel="nofollow"><code>emitN</code></a> where we set the initial value of the <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-release/file/8141476bccc7d2e2468b740df03954d6ab212248/js/src/frontend/BytecodeEmitter.cpp#l361" rel="nofollow">bytecode pointer</a>.</p>
<p>Next we call <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-release/file/8141476bccc7d2e2468b740df03954d6ab212248/js/src/frontend/BytecodeSection.cpp#l176" rel="nofollow">updateDepth at that offset</a> -- this reads back the immediately prior written bytecode. I don't know why this doesn't work on samsung phones, but I'll bet that this is the root cause -- see, under this theory, <code>x12</code> should be our <code>JSOp</code> -- but the actual value in the register we have is <code>0x00000000ffffffba</code> which is way out of bounds for our bytecode count.</p>
<p>Why this is happening now, in 113 where it didn't happen previously is totally unclear. For some reason clang is now emitting a sequence that is tripping this hardware issue?</p>
<p>I've no idea how to resolve this. Patching this flow to avoid the read-after-write is awkward.</p>
</div><div id="c9" data-comment-id="16426231" data-ismarkdown="true"><p>I tried to reverse engineer the assembly, but I do not see what it might corresponds to within StackUses:</p>
<pre><code>  unknown64_t* x19 = /* ??? */;
  size_t x12 = /* ??? */;
  unknown64_t* x10 = &amp;x19[x12];
  int8_t w13 = x10.one_byte_within;
  if (w13 % 32) {  // Potentially a switch statement condition with cases which are all below 32.
    return; // jump far further.
  }
  uint8_t w11 = w13 &amp; 0xff;
  uint64_t (w12, w13) = x27.some_field_in_large_struct; // offset of field 0xf0
  int8_t w10 = x10.two_bytes_within;
  uint16_t w11 = w12 - w11;  // x27.some_field_in_large_struct.first - x10.one_byte_within &amp; 0xff;
</code></pre>
<p>At first I thought x10 could be the CodeSpec, but I would not expect any condition to be added after loading <code>nuses</code>.<br>
Then I wondered if the condition could be the switch statement, but some of the matched opcodes are larger than 32.<br>
I would not expect any of of the complex code path from GET_UINT16.</p>
<p>So I do not think this code belongs to StackUses as reported in the stack trace.</p>
<p>Right, this is potentially the <code>nuses</code> field which is being repeated before being tested elsewhere.</p>

This would sounds like this is a table indexed by opcodes, but there are 2 occurrences where the field at offset 1 is compared against 32 (_ % 32 == 0, or _ &amp; 31 == 0) at 0x6c1b455db0 and 0x6c1b455dc4.<br>
I do not know from where these comparisons are coming from.</p>
<p>Also, given that 0x6c1b455da8 works, this is sounds quite unlikely that a failure would happen at 0x6c1b455dc0, especially since LRDB at 0x6c1b455db8 is suppose to read a single byte.</p>
<p>Could this be a sign issue? LDRB doing a sign extension in w12, which then causes problem when being used by reading the value from in incorrect memory page?</p>

<p>Be careful JS shift operators only work with 32 bits values, and not 64 bits. Thus this is not the correct result here.</p>
</div><div id="c12"><p>I'm at my own wits end on this one; I'm going to leave this one in your hands</p></div><div id="c13" data-comment-id="16433006" data-ismarkdown="true"><p>Poked at this a bit. It looks like everything's all been inlined together into one big pile of instructions and interleaved, but I think I've made a bit of progress.</p>
<p>Consider these instructions from the beginning of Matt's assembly sequence:</p>
<pre><code>0x6c1b455d50	cmp w8, #6    
0x6c1b455d54	movn w9, #0x45   
0x6c1b455d58	cinc w23, w9, ne 
</code></pre>
<p>We are loading the constant ~0x45, then incrementing it if w8 is not 6. Interestingly, ~0x45 is 0xffffffba, which is precisely the mystery value that Matt found in x12. Later on, we have these instructions:</p>
<pre><code>0x6c1b455d7c	adrp x19, #0x6c1d6c5000
0x6c1b455d80	add x19, x19, #0x1d8
...
0x6c1b455d94	and x9, x23, #0xff
...
0x6c1b455d9c	add x9, x19, x9, lsl #3
...
0x6c1b455da8	ldrsb w10, [x9, #1]
</code></pre>
<p>The first two instructions load a hardcoded pointer. The next two compute <code>base_address + (our_mystery_register &amp; 0xff) &lt;&lt; 3</code>. This looks like we're finding an entry from the CodeSpecTable. The last instruction loads (and sign-extends) a value from the CodeSpec: specifically, nuses is at offset 1.</p>
<p><code>0xffffffba &amp; 0xff</code> is 0xba, which is JSOp::GetAliasedVar. 0xbb is JSOp::GetAliasedDebugVar. So the first set of instructions I pulled out maps to <a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/0c2945ad4769e2d4428c72e6ddd78d60eb920394/js/src/frontend/NameOpEmitter.cpp#117-119" rel="nofollow">this code</a>, which we can confirm by noticing that NameLocation::Kind::EnvironmentCoordinate is 6, matching the hardcoded constant.</p>
<p>Staring at the rest of the code, I've convinced myself that x27 is the BytecodeEmitter, and it's being used to reference the vector of bytecode we're emitting. A BytecodeEmitter contains a BytecodeSection at offset 32, which contains a BytecodeVector at offset 0. Doing the math, this means that x27+0x28 is <a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/0c2945ad4769e2d4428c72e6ddd78d60eb920394/mfbt/Vector.h#402" rel="nofollow">mBegin</a>, x27+0x30 is the length, and x27+0x38 is the capacity. With that in mind, here's another interesting sequence of instructions. In this code, x23/w23 holds <code>0xffffffba</code>.</p>
<pre><code>0x6c1b455d4c	ldr x24, [x27, #0x30]     // x24 = offset (length of buffer before writing anything)
...	          
0x6c1b455da0	ldr x10, [x27, #0x28]     // x10 is address of buffer
0x6c1b455da4	strb w23, [x10, x24]      // write opcode in buffer at offset
...				          
0x6c1b455dac	ldr x9, [x27, #0x28]      // x9 is address of buffer
...				          
0x6c1b455db4	add x11, x9, x24          // x11 is offset of opcode we just wrote
0x6c1b455db8	ldrb w12, [x11]           // load the opcode
0x6c1b455dbc	add x10, x19, x12, lsl #3 // look it up in the codespec table
0x6c1b455dc0	ldrsb w13, [x10, #1]      // CRASH!
</code></pre>
<p>In short, we store the opcode in the buffer, then load it again to use as an index into the codespec table. The really interesting thing here is the ldrb. The ARM docs describe it as:</p>
<pre><code>LDRB Wt, addr
Load Byte: loads a byte from memory addressed by addr, then zero-extends it to Wt.
</code></pre>
<p>Since we just stored <code>0xba</code>, that's what x12 should contain. However, that's not what we're seeing. Looking at a dump, I see <code>x12 = 0x00000000ffffffba</code>. That's not zero-extended.</p>
<p>I have a strong suspicion that Samsung (or whoever designed this particular chip) messed up their store forwarding, and accidentally forwarded the entire register without clearing the upper bits.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/zknill/sqledge">https://github.com/zknill/sqledge</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37063238">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-target="readme-toc.content">
            <article itemprop="text"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">SQLedge</h2>
<p dir="auto">[State: alpha]</p>
<p dir="auto">SQLedge uses Postgres logical replication to stream the changes in a source Postgres database to a SQLite database that can run on the edge.
SQLedge serves reads from its local SQLite database, and forwards writes to the upstream Postgres server that it's replicating from.</p>
<p dir="auto">This lets you run your apps on the edge, and have local, fast, and eventually consistent access to your data.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/zknill/sqledge/blob/main/etc/sqledge.png?raw=true"><img src="https://github.com/zknill/sqledge/raw/main/etc/sqledge.png?raw=true" alt="SQLedge"></a></p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">SQL generation</h2>
<p dir="auto">The <code>pkg/sqlgen</code> package has an SQL generator in it, which will generate the SQLite insert, update, delete statements based on the logical replication messages received.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">SQL parsing</h2>
<p dir="auto">When the database is started, we look at which tables already exist in the sqlite copy, and make sure new tables are created automatically on the fly.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Postgres wire proxy</h2>
<p dir="auto">SQLedge contains a Postgres wire proxy, default on <code>localhost:5433</code>. This proxy uses the local SQlite database for reads, and forwards writes to the upstream Postgres server.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Compatibility</h3>
<p dir="auto">When running, the SQL statements interact with two databases; Postgres (for writes) and SQLite (for reads).</p>
<p dir="auto">The Postgres wire proxy (which forwards reads to SQLite) doesn't currently translate any of the SQL statements from the Postgres query format/functions to the SQLite format/functions.
Read queries issued against the Postgres wire proxy need to be compatible with SQLite directly.
This is fine for simple <code>SELECT</code> queries, but you will have trouble with Postgres-specific query functions or syntax.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Copy on startup</h2>
<p dir="auto">SQLEdge maintains a table called <code>postgres_pos</code>, this tracks the LSN (log sequence number) of the received logical replication messages so it can pick up processing where it left
off.</p>
<p dir="auto">If no LSN is found, SQLedge will start a postgres <code>COPY</code> of all tables in the <code>public</code> schema. Creating the appropriate SQLite tables, and inserting data.</p>
<p dir="auto">When the replication slot is first created, it exports a transaction snapshot. This snapshot is used for the initial copy. This means that the <code>COPY</code> command will read the data from
the transaction at the moment the replication slot was created.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Trying it out</h2>

            <article itemprop="text"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">arpchat</h2>
<p dir="auto">so... you know arp? the protocol your computer uses to find the mac addresses of other computers on your network? yeah. that.</p>
<p dir="auto">i thought it would be a great idea to hijack it to make a chat app :)</p>
<p dir="auto">built in two days because i was sick and had nothing better to do.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/98fa6186a676cb35796197e53a178dd2db5a54b978ee17046cffbeac0c8650b6/68747470733a2f2f646f67676f2e6e696e6a612f524a474859482e706e67"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/98fa6186a676cb35796197e53a178dd2db5a54b978ee17046cffbeac0c8650b6/68747470733a2f2f646f67676f2e6e696e6a612f524a474859482e706e67" alt="screenshot of the tool in action" data-canonical-src="https://doggo.ninja/RJGHYH.png"></a></p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">motivation</h2>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>once a year, i'm on a client isolated network that i want to chat with friends over</li>
<li>i'm completely insane</li>
<li>i'm a programmer</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">(i swear, i might actually briefly have a use for this! it might not be entirely useless! ... and other lies i tell myself)</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">limitations</h2>
<p dir="auto">yes</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">things i made arpchat do</h2>
<p dir="auto">you can send messages tens of thousands of characters long because i implemented a (naive) generalizable transport protocol on top of arp. there's also a bit of compression.</p>
<p dir="auto">if you wanted, you could probably split off the networking part of this and use it instead of udp. please don't do this.</p>
<p dir="auto">not only are join and leave notifications a thing, i built an entire presence discovery and heartbeat system to see an updated list of other online users. ironically, part of this serves a similar purpose to arp itself.</p>
<p dir="auto">for more information on how this all works technically, check out <a href="https://kognise.dev/writing/arp" rel="nofollow">the little article i wrote</a>.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">running</h2>
<p dir="auto">if you actually want to install this for some reason, you can get it from <a href="https://github.com/kognise/arpchat/releases/latest">the releases page</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">on windows, you probably need <a href="https://npcap.com/#download" rel="nofollow">npcap</a>. make sure you check "Install Npcap in WinPcap API-compatible Mode" in the installer!</p>
<p dir="auto">on linux, you might have to give arpchat network privileges:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="sudo setcap CAP_NET_RAW+ep /path/to/arpchat"><pre>sudo setcap CAP_NET_RAW+ep /path/to/arpchat</pre></div>

<p dir="auto">then just run the binary in a terminal. you know it's working properly if you can see your own messages when you send them. if you <em>can't</em> see your messages, try selecting a different interface or protocol!</p>
<p dir="auto">have any issues? that really sucks. you can make an issue if it pleases you.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">building</h2>
<p dir="auto">you don't really want to build this. anyway, it's tested on the latest unstable rust.</p>
<p dir="auto">on windows, download the <a href="https://www.winpcap.org/devel.htm" rel="nofollow">WinPcap Developer's Pack</a> and set the <code>LIB</code> environment variable to the <code>WpdPack/Lib/x64/</code> folder.</p>

<p dir="auto">I've done <a href="https://github.com/kognise">a lot of things with computers</a>, but I've always had a gap in my knowledge: what exactly happens when you run a program on your computer? I thought about this gap — I had most of the requisite low-level knowledge, but I was struggling to piece everything together. Are programs really executing directly on the CPU, or is something else going on? I've used syscalls, but how do they <em>work</em>? What are they, really? How do multiple programs run at the same time?</p>

<h3>from the <i>can-we-not?</i> dept</h3>

<p>I do understand why so many people, especially creative folks, are worried about AI and how it’s used. The future is quite unknown, and things are changing very rapidly, at a pace that can feel out of control. However, when concern and worry about new technologies and how they may impact things morphs into mob-inspiring fear, dumb things happen. I would much rather that when we look at new things, we take a more realistic approach to them, and look at ways we can keep the good parts of what they provide, while looking for ways to mitigate the downsides.</p>
<p>Hopefully without everyone going crazy in the meantime. Unfortunately, that’s not really the world we live in.</p>
<p>Last year, when everyone was focused on generative AI for images, we had Rob Sheridan on the podcast to talk about why it was important for creative people to figure out <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/09/13/techdirt-podcast-episode-329-is-ai-art-the-end-for-artists/" target="_blank">how to embrace the technology</a> rather than fear it. The opening story of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/29/technology/mike-masnick-techdirt-internet-future.html" target="_blank">recent NY Times profile of me</a> was all about me in a group chat, trying to suggest to some very creative Hollywood folks how to embrace AI rather than simply raging against it. And I’ve already called out how folks rushing to copyright, thinking that will somehow “save” them from AI, are <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/07/19/stop-rushing-to-copyright-as-a-tool-to-solve-the-problems-of-ai/" target="_blank">barking up the wrong tree</a>.</p>
<p>But, in the meantime, the fear over AI is leading to some crazy and sometimes unfortunate outcomes. Benji Smith, who created what appears to be an absolutely amazing tool for writers, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.shaxpir.com/" target="_blank">Shaxpir</a>, also created what looked like an absolutely fascinating tool called Prosecraft, that had scanned and analyzed a whole bunch of books and would let you call up really useful data on books.</p>
<p>He created it years ago, based on an idea he had years earlier, trying to understand the length of various books (which he initially kept in a spreadsheet). As <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blog.shaxpir.com/taking-down-prosecraft-io-37e189797121">Smith himself describes in a blog post</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I heard a story on NPR about how </em><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oP3c1h8v2ZQ"><em><u>Kurt Vonnegut</u></em></a><em> invented an idea about the “shapes of stories” by counting happy and sad words. The University of Vermont “Computational Story Lab” published </em><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://hedonometer.org/papers.html"><em><u>research papers</u></em></a><em> about how this technique could show the major plot points and the “emotional story arc” of the </em><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://hedonometer.org/books/v2/Harry%20Potter%20and%20the%20Sorcerer's%20Stone/"><em><u>Harry Potter</u></em></a><em> novels (as well as many many other books).</em></p>
<p><em>So I tried it myself and found that I could plot a graph of the emotional ups and downs of any story. I added those new “sentiment analysis” tools to the prosecraft website too.</em></p>
<p><em>When I ran out of books on my own shelves, I looked to the internet for more text that I could analyze, and I used web crawlers to find more books. I wanted to be mindful of the diversity of different stories, so I tried to find books by authors of every race and gender, from every different cultural and political background, writing in every different genre and exploring all different kinds of themes. Fiction and nonfiction and philosophy and science and religion and culture and politics.</em></p>
<p><em>Somewhere out there on the internet, I thought to myself, there was a new author writing a horror or romance or fantasy novel, struggling for guidance about how long to write their stories, how to write more vivid prose, and how much “passive voice” was too much or too little.</em></p>
<p><em>I wanted to give those budding storytellers a suite of “lexicographic” tools that they could use, to compare their own writing with the writing of authors they admire. I’ve been working in the field of computational linguistics and machine learning for 20+ years, and I was always frustrated that the fancy tools were only accessible to big businesses and government spy agencies. I wanted to bring that magic to everyone.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Frankly, all of that sounds amazing. And amazingly useful. Even more amazing is that he built it, and it worked. It would produce useful analysis of books, such as this example from Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland:</p>
<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/lex-img-p.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/img/66fe5a2d-6b6a-4a0c-ac35-ac0be3cae2b0-RackMultipart20230808-122-dsis3v.png?ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>
</div>
<p>And, it could also do further analysis like the following:</p>
<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" src="https://i0.wp.com/lex-img-p.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/img/ed8ec575-1878-412b-a5f5-6d8b19fc0166-RackMultipart20230808-139-rgmlwd.png?resize=550%2C198&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="550" height="198" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>

<p>This is all quite interesting. It’s also the kind of thing that data scientists do on all kinds of work for useful purposes.</p>
<p>Smith built Prosecraft into Shaxpir, again, making it a more useful tool. But, on Monday, some authors on the internet found out about it and lost their shit, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://gizmodo.com/prosecraft-books-shut-down-ai-algorithms-novel-fiction-1850715319" target="_blank">leading Smith to shut the whole project down</a>.</p>
<p>There seems to be a lot of misunderstanding about all of this. Smith notes that he had researched the copyright issues and was sure he wasn’t violating anything, and he’s right. We’ve gone over this many times before. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.techdirt.com/2013/11/14/google-gets-total-victory-over-authors-guild-book-scanning-is-fair-use/" target="_blank">Scanning books is pretty clearly fair use</a>. What you do with that later <em>could</em> violate copyright law, but I don’t see anything that Prosecraft did that comes anywhere even remotely close to violating copyright law.</p>
<p>But… some authors got pretty upset about all of it.</p>

</div>
<p>I’m still perplexed at what the complaint is here? You don’t need to “consent” for someone to analyze your book. You don’t need to “consent” to someone putting up statistics about their analysis of your book.</p>
<p>But, Zach’s tweet went viral with a bunch of folks ready to blow up anything that smacks of tech bro AI, and lots of authors started yelling at Smith.</p>
<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/lex-img-p.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/img/c1fdb6a0-0bca-4b2c-b9c6-5103b6997b50-RackMultipart20230808-122-gei1hr.png?ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>
</div>
<p>The Gizmodo article has a ridiculously wrong “fair use” analysis, saying “Fair Use does not, by any stretch of the imagination, allow you to use an author’s entire copyrighted work without permission as a part of a data training program that feeds into your own ‘AI algorithm.’” Except… it almost certainly does? Again, we’ve gone through this with the Google Book scanning case, and the courts said that you can absolutely do that because it’s transformative.</p>
<p>It seems that what really tripped up people here was the “AI” part of it, and the fear that this was just another a VC funded “tech bro” exercise of building something to get rich by using the works of creatives. Except… none of that is accurate. As Smith explained in his blog post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>For what it’s worth, the prosecraft website has never generated any income. The Shaxpir desktop app is a labor of love, and during most of its lifetime, I’ve worked other jobs to pay the bills while trying to get the company off the ground and solve the technical challenges of scaling a startup with limited resources. We’ve never taken any VC money, and the whole company is a two-person operation just working our hardest to serve our small community of authors.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He also recognizes that the concerns about it being some “AI” thing are probably what upset people, but plenty of authors have found the tool super useful, and even added their own books:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I launched the prosecraft website in the summer of 2017, and I started showing it off to authors at writers conferences. The response was universally positive, and I incorporated the prosecraft analytic tools into the Shaxpir desktop application so that authors could privately run these analytics on their own works-in-progress (without ever sharing those analyses publicly, or even privately with us in our cloud).</em></p>
<p><em>I’ve spent thousands of hours working on this project, cleaning up and annotating text, organizing and tweaking things. A small handful of authors have even reached out to me, asking to have their books added to the website. I was grateful for their enthusiasm.</em></p>
<p><em>But in the meantime, “AI” became a thing.</em></p>
<p><em>And the arrival of AI on the scene has been tainted by early use-cases that allow anyone to create zero-effort impersonations of artists, cutting those creators out of their own creative process.</em></p>
<p><em>That’s not something I ever wanted to participate in.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Smith took the project down entirely because of that. He doesn’t want to get lumped in with other projects, and even though his project is almost certainly legal, he recognized that this was becoming an issue:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Today the community of authors has spoken out, and I’m listening. I care about you, and I hear your objections.</em></p>
<p><em>Your feelings are legitimate, and I hope you’ll accept my sincerest apologies. I care about stories. I care about publishing. I care about authors. I never meant to hurt anyone. I only hoped to make something that would be fun and useful and beautiful, for people like me out there struggling to tell their own stories.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I find all of this really unfortunate. Smith built something really cool, really amazing, that does not, in any way, infringe on anyone’s rights. I get the kneejerk reaction from some authors, who feared that this was some obnoxious project, but couldn’t they have taken 10 minutes to look at the details of what it was they were killing?</p>
<p>I know we live in an outrage era, where the immediate reaction is to turn the outrage meter up to 11. I’m certainly guilty of that at times myself. But this whole incident is just sad. It was an overreaction from the start, destroying what had been a clear labor of love and a useful project, through misleading and misguided attacks from authors.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>We tasked the Netherlands based security firm Radically Open Security (RoS) with performing the third audit towards our VPN infrastructure.</p>

<p>We asked them to focus solely on VPN servers that run from RAM, one OpenVPN and one WireGuard server.</p>

<p>We invite you to <a href="https://mullvad.net/media/Mullvad_VPN_Pentest_Report_2023_1.1.pdf">read the final report</a><strong> </strong>of our third security audit, concluded in mid-June 2023, with many fixes deployed late June 2023. Further re-tests and a verification pass was performed during July.</p>

<p>RoS discovered a number of new findings, and we would like to thank them for their thorough and detailed report. They stated , amongst other things that: that whilst they found some issues, that: “The Mullvad VPN relays which were the subject of this test showed a mature architecture…” and “During the test we found no logging of user activity data..”</p>

<p>We gave RoS full SSH access to two (2) VPN servers that were running from RAM, using our latest slimmed down Linux kernel (6.3.2) and customised Ubuntu 22.04 LTS based OS. These servers were deployed as though they were <strong>to be</strong> production customer-facing servers, however these servers <strong>have never been utilised </strong>as such.</p>

<p>We asked them to verify:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Security and set up of servers internally</li>
	<li>Security and set up of servers externally</li>
	<li>Whether or not we log customer activity</li>
</ul>

<p>RoS also asked whether they should investigate the source code of various binaries running on our systems, or whether they should take into consideration the hardware-level security. We declined both offers, stating that this is to be considered an <em>“after the system is running and in-use by customers”</em> audit.</p>

<h2>Overview of findings</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Radically Open Security found no information leakage or logging of customer data</li>
	<li>RoS discovered 1 High, 6 Elevated, 4 Moderate, 10 Low and 4 info-severity issues during this penetration test.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Key takeaway:</strong> Our VPN infrastructure has been audited for the third time.</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous issues of interest</h2>

<h3>MLL-024 Production multihop traffic on test system (High)</h3>

<p><strong>To quote RoS:</strong><em> “Impact - Production user traffic is visible to pentest users.”</em></p>

<p><strong>Our comments:</strong></p>

<p>RoS were given production-like servers, provisioned and deployed like all other customer facing servers. The difference between these and the rest of our fleet is that they have never been made available for customers to connect, they were not advertised in our server list, and not offered up to users. However, as these servers are connected to our WireGuard multihop functionality, <strong>any customer scanning for IPs</strong> can send traffic though them whilst connected to another VPN server using a SOCKS5 proxy, as there is nothing blocking it.</p>

<p>In what RoS discovered there was only the IP from the WireGuard internal interface. This interface is only available to SOCKS5 multihop traffic, so it would be the entry WireGuard server.</p>

<p>Without providing RoS with production servers the audit would not have been valid as a production server audit, and there would have been no way to prevent customer traffic from being visible on the servers.</p>

<h3>MLL-019 - LPE to root using systemd timers and insecure directory permissions (Elevated)</h3>

<p><strong>To quote RoS:</strong><em> “Low-privileged system accounts can elevate their privileges to root by manipulating systemd timer script content.”</em></p>

<p><strong>Our comments:</strong></p>

<p>It became obvious after consulting with RoS that the primary issue here is the use of nested home directories, and the addition of administrator users being part of the <code>mad</code> group.</p>

<p>The usage of the nested <code>/home/mad</code> directory structure is a legacy remnant of pre-RAM VPN servers, which is going to be removed in the upcoming updates to our infrastructure. In the short-term we have removed all administrator users from being part of the <code>mad</code> group, but we have also moved all related scripts to <code>/opt/local_checks</code> which RoS acknowledged as resolving the issue.</p>

<h3>MLL-045 — Administrator access to production machines (Moderate)</h3>

<p><strong>To quote RoS:</strong> <em>“VPN servers accept remote logins from administrators, who technically have the ability to tap into production users' VPN traffic”</em></p>

<p><strong>Our comments:</strong></p>

<p>We have been aware of this issue for some time, and conversing with RoS only confirmed our plans to implement such measures:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Implement a method by which unauthorised logins can be auditable, and add a log of all the commands (without arguments) used on these servers. We are implementing such a system.</li>
	<li>Remove support for SSH entirely, this would mean that even administrators could not enable logging of customer traffic, since no access is enabled over SSH. We are investigating such a system, though this will take more time to perform correctly.</li>
</ul>

<h3>MLL-016 - Telegraf password shared across servers (low)</h3>

<p><strong>To quote RoS: </strong><em>“Shared Influx database credentials used by Telegraf across VPN servers allows manipulation of global server metrics, such as CPU and disk usage or network metrics.”</em></p>

<p><strong>Our comments:</strong></p>

<p>We deemed the best course of action here to implement client certificates for authentication using the PKI infrastructure available within Hashicorp Vault. This has now been implemented, and we will investigate the use of such certificates in other places across our infrastructure.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>There are more changes to be deployed in the near future, and the listed fixes are examples of the most interesting issues that Radically Open Security found.</p>

<p>For the universal right to privacy,<br>
Mullvad</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<h2>J-CIA - MOS 6526 / 8521 / (8520) FPGA REPLACEMENT</h2>
<p><img src="https://1nt3r.net/j-cia/JCIA64_2.JPG" alt="J-CIA, J-CIA64, J6526, FPGA 6526 / 8521"></p><h2>Modern spare part for Commodore 64, Commodore 128, SX-64 and 1570/1571 -drives</h2>

<li>FPGA based replacement for MOS 6526 &amp; 8521 CIA chips</li>
<li>Complete logic and all features of the original IC's implemented</li>
<li>All diagnostic &amp; software tests passed 100%, including all tests in Wolfgang Lorenz's test suite and Vice-project's CIA-tests.</li>
<li>[Vice's ciaports-tests may show partly incorrect results, but then again, original cias show variable results too.]</li>
<li>Hundreds of demos and games already tested, no known compatibility issues currently</li>
<li>Physically about the same size as the original CIAs</li>
<li>Lots of hardware tested and found to be compatible including (but not limited to) WifiModem, Ultimate-II+, SD2IEC, TapeCart, 1351-mouse</li>
<li>Tested with all C64 mainboard revisions, SX-64 and with EVO64 mainboard, Commodore 128 (including CP/M and disk drive burst-mode) and 1570 &amp; 1571.</li>
<li>Works in 1 MHz and 2 MHz modes.</li>
<li>This 6526/8521 version has been tested to work on a 1581 drive too by a betatester, but full compatibility cannot be guaranteed.
</li><li>(8520 Amiga -version would be the correct one for 1581)</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li><span color="red">This "J-CIA64" -version is not compatible with Amiga / 8520-CIA and cannot be later converted or upgraded to be.</span></li>
<li>Amiga -compatible version will be a separate product that will be released later.</li>

<h3>Changing mode between 8521 "new" and 6526 "old" CIA:</h3>
<li>Mode between new (8521) and old (6526) cia type can be changed</li>
<li>with a solder jumper on the underside of J-CIA64</li>
<li>"New" 8521 mode is default and 6526-mode can be enabled by soldering</li>
<li>two pads together as in the right on the image below:</li>
<p><img src="https://1nt3r.net/j-cia/mode-jumper.jpg" alt="J-CIA64 mode jumper"></p><li>Usually, the mode doesn't need to be changed,</li>
<li>most sofware and hardware are designed to work with both versions.</li>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<li>Although J-CIA could be soldered directly to mainboard, using IC sockets is highly recommended.</li>
<li>Pins on J-CIA are gold plated round pins, which will work with all kinds of sockets, but</li>
<li>the pins are a bit thicker than original IC-pins, which may cause slight stress to some leaf-type</li>
<li>sockets. This is a the same with all reproduction IC's with turned pins. </li>
<li>Be careful when pressing the J-CIA into a socket and make sure it is aligned properly and </li>
<li>pressed down evenly to avoid bending or breaking of pins.</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>J-CIA orientation: PIN 1 is marked with a number 1 on PCB. That should match PIN 1 position on mainboard.</li>
<li>There is also a half circle marked on the top of the J-CIA. This relates to the notch on original IC's and the notch on IC-sockets</li>
<li>On a C64 CIA PIN 1 is located on top left of the both CIA -locations.</li>
<li>On a C128 the other CIA position is "upside-down", so be careful installing a new CIA the correct way</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>Original RF-shields may require insulating, modifications or even removing.</li>
<li>Before turning on the power, check that the RF-shield metal does not touch J-CIA(s).</li>
<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
<li>J-CIA / J-CIA64 reproduces the functionality of the original MOS CIA's</li>
<li>Because it's a reproduction, it cannot be ever fully like the original.</li>
<li>Logic aims to be exactly like the original, but there may be differences that have not been found yet.</li>
<li>Electrically J-CIA is "close enough" to the original CIA, but it is not exactly the same.</li>
<li><i>Although tested with a lot of hardware and software, compatibility with all hardware and software cannot be guaranteed.</i></li>
<li>nstalling the J-CIA64 requires delicate handling and taking the proper precautions to prevent antistatic discharges.</li>
<li>The seller or manufacturer cannot be held responsible for any possible damage this product may cause to your</li>
<li>equipment due to incorrect installation or mishandling of the product.</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In case you’re wondering how Canonical’s infamous recruitment process plays out, here’s a step-by-step account of what I went through for a non-technical role. I didn’t have any immediate need to land a new job, which is part of the reason why I decided to stick with it to see how it worked. (Had I succeeded, I would have been onboarded 4-5 months after I’d sent in my CV.)</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr It took 81 days, a CV, a cover letter, an application form, a 22-question written interview, two standardised tests, and four (4) in-person interviews. And that wasn’t even close to the entire recruitment process!</strong></p>

<p>Day 0: I read about this job and I was SO EXCITED because it ticked all my boxes. I literally got home from work and applied. I submitted my CV and answered the questions in their application form. Some of them asked about high school. Canonical – or, should we say, Mark Shuttleworth, the self-appointed benevolent dictator for life - genuinely believes that knowing what you did in high school will give useful information about whether they should hire you. They justify this all over the place.</p>

<p>Day 25: Automated email from a person stating they were my hiring lead. &nbsp;This email included the written interview – 22 questions about everything from ‘What would you most want to change about Canonical?’ (sure, let me just critizicize the company I am trying to work for) to multiple questions about high school. Even if you are in a country where it isn’t called high school, or if you were homeschooled, or were in a chaotic foster care situation and moved schools multiple times, or if you dropped out and later got a GED (or didn’t). They don’t care if you have to drag up actual traumas from decades ago - you WILL tell them about high school.</p>

<p>I suspect most of the value here is that they use it as a winnowing process, given that they have tens of thousands of applicants every month. If you’re not willing to jump through this hoop, that’s one less person they have to consider.</p>

<p>I didn’t keep notes from my first interview and that person may have referred to my written interview, but no one else did, even though I had some brilliant answers (the way I won a major post-college scholarship was a masterpiece of An Example Of A Time Where I Showed Initiative, thanks very much).</p>

<p>Here it is:</p>

<p><em>Context</em></p>

<p><em>Outline your thoughts on the mission of Canonical. What is it about the company's purpose and goals which is most appealing to you? What do you see as risky or unappealing?</em></p>

<p><em>Why do you most want to work for Canonical?</em></p>

<p><em>What would you most want to change about Canonical?</em></p>

<p><em>What gets you most excited about this role?</em></p>

<p><em>What support would you need from Canonical to be successful</em></p>

<p><em>Experience</em></p>

<p><em>Please outline your most relevant experience for this role.</em></p>

<p><em>What are the key attributes of an outstanding executive assistant?</em></p>

<p><em>Please describe a situation where you had to hold firm on a difficult issue.</em></p>

<p><em>What is different about the role of Executive Assistant in a remote-first business?</em></p>

<p><em>Describe any experience you have working across many time zones.</em></p>

<p><em>Describe improvements you have made to a process in previous roles.</em></p>

<p><em>How do you remain calm in a high-stress, fast-paced environment?</em></p>

<p><em>What has been the highlight of your career so far, and why?</em></p>

<p><em>Education</em></p>

<p><em>We consider academic results in high school and university for all roles, regardless of seniority or department. To enjoy a long and varied career at Canonical, one would need to tackle problems that cannot be defined today! From engineering to marketing to operations and sales, we intensely value colleagues who are able to puzzle through difficult problems and find the optimal path forward.</em></p>

<p><em>How did you rank in your high school, in your final year in maths and hard sciences? Which was your strongest?</em></p>

<p><em>How did you rank in your high school, in your final year in languages and the arts? Which was your strongest?</em></p>

<p><em>Please state your high school graduation results or university entrance results, along with the system used, and how to understand those. For example, in the US, you might give your SAT or ACT scores. In Germany, you might give your scores 1-5.</em></p>

<p><em>What sort of high school student were you? Outside of class, what were your interests and hobbies? What would your high school peers remember you for, if we asked them?</em></p>

<p><em>Which university and degree did you choose? What other universities did you consider, and why did you select that one?</em></p>

<p><em>At university, did you do particularly well in an area of your degree?</em></p>

<p><em>Overall, what was your degree result and how did that reflect on your ability?</em></p>

<p><em>In high school and university, what did you achieve that was exceptional?</em></p>

<p><em>What leadership roles did you take on during your education?</em></p>

<p>Day 29: Submitted the written interview.</p>

<p>Day 30: Completed the Thomas GIA test. This is a standardised test which makes you rotate shapes in a box, work out basic logic problems, and do things with words and numbers. I hate standardised tests, because all they reveal is how good you are at taking standardised tests (this is what I mentioned in the ‘tell us what you’d change’ section of the written interview) and no, they are not unbiased.</p>

<p>I did as many practice tests as I could to make sure I aced it, and according to the Thomas International report I got afterwards, I scored well in all five areas. They didn’t give me my actual scores but I was ‘above average’, and they gave advice on how these results would affect&nbsp;my working relationships. For all five areas, the advice they gave me was basically, ‘when you’re talking to your wooden-headed co-workers, dumb&nbsp;it down for the proles, Brainiac.’</p>

<p>Day 32: I was invited for an interview. Or rather, three interviews – two with people on the team I was applying to, one on a different team. One hour each. They don’t compare notes, so all of their opinions are allegedly unbiased, but a) this means you get asked the same/similar questions, which is boring for me and a waste of time for them, and b) exactly how unbiased is it when every person I interviewed with was exactly my demographic? (White, female, American/western European. The fifth interview, had I reached it, would have been in that demographic too. My hiring lead was a woman of colour, but my only non-automated contact with her was one brief response to an email I sent her early in the process.)</p>

<p>Day 35: Automated email from Mark Shuttleworth which started, ‘Given that you are now starting the final stage interview to join our team’, even though I was nowhere near the final stage interviews. Mark’s icon is a green dragon, which indicated that if I made it through this interminable quest, he would be the final boss fight. Someone might want to fix the typos in this email.</p>

<p>Day 46: Peer interview 1. Pretty chill. She said she was the newest member of the team.</p>

<p>Day 51: Cross-team interview. Since this was with someone in the travel department (there was a LOT of travel with this job), I assumed she would ask me about my extensive travel experience...but no, it was all boring rote competency stuff (‘tell me about a time you solved a problem’). The final question was the ‘fun’ one – what was I watching on my favourite streaming service? I don’t have one, thanks. Seriously, though, your entire career is in travel, and this job is a lot about travel (both doing it and organising it), and I have travelled to one of the most dangerous places on earth multiple times, as I mentioned in my cover letter, and you’re not going to ask me a single question about that?</p>

<p>Day 52: Peer interview 2. Geniunely one of the most fun interviews I’ve ever had. She told me outright that she was putting me forward as a good prospect, calling me an Ubuntu fangirl (aw, shucks), telling me I’d fit in and it was great that I was genuinely interested in the product and open source and would fit in with their software engineers.</p>

<p>Day 65: Received an invitation to book my interview with the Talent team – they call them Talent Scientists (?! – even one of my interviewers thought that was a dumb name) – and do the most ridiculous standardised test ever, the Thomas PPA, where you pick words that are most and least like you, and then they calculate your actual personality from the words you don’t choose, or something. I pretended I was the best example of my role and chose the words that described that persona. No one ever referred to either of these standardised tests, by the way.</p>

<p>The interview booking email included&nbsp;the following line about scheduling this interview:</p>

<p><em>‘We’d appreciate it if you pick the earliest time available.’</em></p>

<p>You <strong>what</strong>?</p>

<p>You’ve been stringing me along for over two months, and you’re instructing <strong>me</strong> not to dawdle?</p>

<p>At some point around this time, I realised the main problem with this ridiculously drawn-out interview process was that I didn’t care anymore. I was so excited when I applied, and I lost every bit of that along the way. All I was doing was jumping through their hoops and answering the same types of questions. No one actually wanted to talk to me about any of the great things I’d told them about in my written interview, or even the interesting stuff I’d done in my most recent jobs, even when it was highly relevant for this job.</p>

<p>Day 78: Interview with the Talent ‘Scientist’. (Another white western woman.) This interview was so dry and robotic. 30 minutes of going backwards through my CV, with her asking the same rote questions about each job. No, I don’t know what the guy who hired me ad hoc for a few months to write some grant applications would have said my weaknesses were, but dammit she insisted I had to come up with something. 20 minutes of the same competency-based questions hurled at me for the three previous interviews. I clearly got dinged for not showing enough initiative in one of my examples and for only having done a particular aspect of my role for 12 people (when for this job I’d have needed to do it for hundreds of people).</p>

<p>There was all of 10 minutes to actually discuss working conditions at the company. This was my fourth interview, and only now were things like ‘we don’t provide you with a laptop’ coming up. (And you have to install Ubuntu on it - which, sure, eat your own dog food, but if you’re using a Macbook, installing Ubuntu is a pain. And it wasn’t as if I was actually going to be working with the product itself.) Annual leave allowances were generous, definitely above the statutory UK requirements, but not being able to float the bank holidays implied that non-Christian staff members would need to use annual leave for their own religious holidays while being mandated to take off Good Friday and Easter Monday. Salary expectations were mentioned but I literally had no idea, so that was something that would have been discussed later on in the process, had I made it that far.</p>

<p>I didn’t.</p>

<p>Day 81: Automated rejection. A long, long email I didn’t read to the end. I wonder whether their Talent ‘Scientists’ factor in interview fatigue when they judge whether you are permitted to move forward.</p>

<p>Had I continued the process, I would have gone through at least four and possibly five more interviews with:</p>

<p>- a senior member of the team</p>

<p>- the leader of the team</p>

<p>- my hiring lead</p>

<p>- one of the people I would have been working with</p>

<p>- and possibly the space-faring South African billionaire himself. I even knew what witty question I would have asked him. Alas, ‘twill never be.</p>

<p>So that’s what you can expect with Canonical. Go for it if the job is something you really want, and if you have no immediate need for a job, and if you really really REALLY like having interviews.</p>

<p>PS Just before posting this, I got an automated email asking me, “how has [sic] your interview experience?” Well, here’s your answer.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/08/amazon_arm_servers/">https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/08/amazon_arm_servers/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37059533">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Amazon is the most successful manufacturer of Arm server chips, accounting for just over half of Arm-based server CPUs currently deployed, while some chipmakers are also now betting on Arm-based Windows PCs.</p>
<p>This information comes from a report issued by Bernstein Research which estimates that nearly 10 percent of servers across the world contain Arm processors, and 40 percent of those are located in China, as we <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/02/arm_server_china/">reported</a> earlier.</p>
<p>But that total is beaten by just one company – Amazon – which has slightly above 50 percent of all Arm server CPUs in the world deployed in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) datacenters, said the analyst.</p>

    

<p>Amazon currently uses its own Graviton family of chips, designed by the Annapurna Labs division of Amazon Web Services and introduced to the world back in 2018, which are for its own internal use only. The latest iteration is the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/11/29/aws_graviton3e_srd/">Graviton3E</a> for high-performance computing applications, introduced towards the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2022/01/04/inside-amazons-graviton3-arm-server-processor/">end of 2022</a>.</p>

        


        

<p>According to Bernstein, because these chips were optimized for the specific needs of AWS, the company is able to fit in more cores per socket or per rack and the chips consume less power, translating to lower spending on space and cooling.</p>
<p>It is often asserted that while Arm cores might be more energy efficient, they provide lower performance than x86 chips. However, the report said that customer testimonies compiled by Amazon claim 20 percent to 70 percent lower cost at the same performance as comparable x86 chips.</p>

        

<p>Bernstein's report estimates that Graviton represented about 20 percent of AWS CPU instances by mid-2022, most of which would have been the 7nm Graviton2, but Amazon is moving to deploy 5nm Graviton3 and 3E instances and is expected to introduce a Graviton4 with the Armv9 architecture fabricated using TSMC's 3nm production process in 2025.</p>
<p>Ampere is credited as being "arguably the second most successful Arm server CPU supplier," which the report estimates to have between 5 and 10 percent of this market. It managed to grow from essentially nothing to account for 0.6 percent of all CPU instances available from cloud providers globally by mid-2022, as per the report.</p>
<h3>Future of Huawei and Phytium CPUs 'unclear'</h3>
<p>Other companies with Arm server chips include Nvidia, which is introducing <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/06/17/nvidia_arm_servers/">products based on its Grace Arm CPU</a> to market, plus Huawei and Phytium in China. However, Bernstein notes that "US export controls put Phytium on the Entity List and Huawei on the Foreign Direct Product rule," as a consequence of which, both are facing difficulties in accessing foundries with advanced process node technologies and "the future of their CPUs is very unclear."</p>
<p>Looking beyond servers, Bernstein's report estimates that Arm chips powered about 12 percent of PCs shipped in the fourth quarter of 2022 (excluding Chromebooks), with the vast majority of these being Macs.</p>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/03/aws_custom_xeon_m7i_instances/">AWS is running a 96-core, 192-thread, custom Xeon server</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/15/amd_aws_bergamo/">Amazon isn't sold on AMD's tiny Zen 4c cores in manycore Bergamo processors</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/02/27/bitnami_arm_support/">Arm has legs: VMware's Bitnami starts packaging apps for Graviton and Ampere</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The research notes that Qualcomm has invested heavily to try to replicate Apple's success with Arm-based Macs on Windows PCs, via its <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/03/16/qualcomm_closes_nuvia_announces_chipset/">acquisition of chip designer Nuvia</a>. Bernstein expects to see Qualcomm launch the first chip later this year, and that devices such as Microsoft's Surface will be available with it shortly after.</p>
<p>However, the report warns that unlikethe "closed" software systems of Apple and the cloud providers, the open software ecosystem of Windows (sorry readers, that's what the report says), with its catalogue of x86 applications, makes introducing Windows-based PCs on a new CPU architecture a much more difficult proposition.</p>
<p>Other companies dipping a toe in the Arm-based PC market include Taiwan-based <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/11/16/qualcomm_arm_windows/">MediaTek</a> and Samsung, and Microsoft notably launched an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/10/25/windows_dev_kit_2023/">Arm-powered developer system</a>, the Windows Dev Kit 2023, late last year. ®</p>

<p>This photo gives me the creeps.<span id="more-7745"></span></p>
<p>When you work with dangerous stuff, you have to condition yourself to respond at the level of emotion. You have to think things out too, but having a sense of what you can and can’t do that operates immediately is important. Children learn that hot stoves and automobile traffic are dangerous. We automatically stop at the street. It’s tourist season in Santa Fe, though, and I have observed that some lack that automatic response.</p>
<p>I’ve dealt with dangerous stuff since I was a child. I had a real chemistry set, not the baking-powder-and-vinegar wimp boxes that are the only things sold now. My parents walked with me a lot in the outdoors and made it clear that wild strawberries were good to eat and deadly nightshade was not.</p>
<p>I loved my lab courses in high school and college. Working at a national laboratory added more precautions I needed to learn. I worked with high-voltage lasers. I did a little bit of plutonium chemistry in a glovebox. And then I managed people who were developing cans for storing plutonium.</p>
<p>We expected the plutonium to be in the form of flat cylindrical ingots, like the enriched uranium in this photo. <img data-attachment-id="7746" data-permalink="https://nucleardiner.wordpress.com/2017/06/19/a-critical-problem/400px-heuraniumc/" data-orig-file="https://nucleardiner.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/400px-heuraniumc.jpg" data-orig-size="400,320" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="400px-HEUraniumC" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://nucleardiner.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/400px-heuraniumc.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://nucleardiner.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/400px-heuraniumc.jpg?w=400" src="https://nucleardiner.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/400px-heuraniumc.jpg?w=1000" alt="400px-HEUraniumC" srcset="https://nucleardiner.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/400px-heuraniumc.jpg 400w, https://nucleardiner.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/400px-heuraniumc.jpg?w=150&amp;h=120 150w, https://nucleardiner.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/400px-heuraniumc.jpg?w=300&amp;h=240 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px">It had to be protected from the air, from unauthorized removal, and from criticality incidents. The criticality safety group played an important part in designing those cans. The cans were about a foot high. The ingots were about an inch thick. The extra space was for criticality safety.</p>
<p>Probably before I came to Los Alamos, I read about Louis Slotin and Harry Daghlian, who were killed by criticality incidents. They were doing experiments to determine criticality properties for nuclear weapons design. They died horribly. Don’t read about them unless you have a strong stomach.</p>
<p>The metal rods in the top photo are plutonium. Rods can roll. These rods could roll closer to each other and perhaps produce the kind of runaway neutron reaction that killed Slotin and Daghlian. Putting a hand in to separate them could make the reaction worse because the water in a human body reflects the neutrons.</p>
<p>I had formal safety training, informal discussions with more experienced people, and made it a point to internalize rules of thumb. Keep pieces of plutonium separate. Abide by glovebox limitations; every glovebox has a sign with the limits of plutonium allowed in it. For solutions, keep them dilute and in flat containers. Flat/thin is safer; the closer a shape is to spherical, the less material is needed to go critical. IIRC, there were racks to put rods in if you were working with that shape of metal, so that they didn’t accidentally roll together.</p>

They are based on an investigation reported <a href="https://apps.publicintegrity.org/nuclear-negligence/">here</a>. According to those articles, a technician ignored glovebox limits and arranged the plutonium to take that photo for management. A Los Alamos manager is also quoted in the articles as saying that the criticality safety group was an unnecessary expense. A number of the senior people in the criticality safety group were of my vintage and were expected to retire about when I did. According to the articles, management’s signal was heard loud and clear, and the rest left.</p>
<p>It took the criticality safety group two months to work out the criticality aspects of our can design. I found that frustrating, too. They had to consider the way the cans might be stacked, how they might fall together and how the ingots inside might move if a stack of cans fell. What if they were in a flooded area? If people decided to rescue them from that flooded area? Water, by itself and in human bodies, enhances the neutron reactions that lead to criticality.</p>
<p>The criticality safety group develops those criticality limits posted on gloveboxes. They take into account the kinds of operations in the glovebox, the equipment inside, and the effects of operators’ hands and bodies nearby.</p>
<p>I learned from people who recalled personally what happened to Slotin and Daghlian. Today’s managers at Los Alamos are rotated through, I’ve heard, every two years. There are not many other places where one learns criticality safety. If Los Alamos is to manufacture nuclear weapons pits, criticality safety evaluation is essential.</p>
<p>A criticality accident affects people who are close to it. It is not a nuclear explosion; the neutron reactions are the same but occur much more slowly. The closest people die horribly, but some tens of feet distance and walls between will shield others. Raemer Schrieber was present at the Slotin accident and lived into his eighties.</p>
<p>It is unconscionable not to educate workers to the dangers involved with handling plutonium. It is worse to encourage poor practice. Did the manager for whom that photo was made understand criticality safety? Or the manager who said to just keep working?</p>
<p>One of the reasons for adding industrial partners to the management of Los Alamos along with the University of California was to improve safety practices. That was done without considering the standard industrial management practice of rotating managers rapidly and the ever-present profit motive. Industry does things better, period. But perhaps not for a singular enterprise like designing and building nuclear weapons.</p>
<p><strong>Coda:</strong> I am usually highly critical of articles on nuclear issues coming from the Center for Public Integrity. They often get the science wrong and display an excessive fear of radioactivity. They did a much better job with this investigation. There are a number of small errors and infelicities of word use in these articles, but nothing like the bloopers they have produced before.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> The National Nuclear Security Administration says that the issues of criticality safety have been cleared up.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Statement from <a href="https://twitter.com/FrankKlotzNNSA">@FrankKlotzNNSA</a> on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NNSA?src=hash">#NNSA</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/safety?src=hash">#safety</a> <a href="https://t.co/qn0MjKlVPm">pic.twitter.com/qn0MjKlVPm</a></p>
<p>— NNSA (@NNSANews) <a href="https://twitter.com/NNSANews/status/876924097153966080">June 19, 2017</a></p></blockquote>
<p>This is plausible because the photo is said to have been made in 2011. That would allow time to reassert the importance of criticality safety and rebuild the group responsible for it. And, as I said above, the Center for Public Integrity has been sensationalistic in the past. But I’d like to hear more from NNSA. The fact that that incident occurred at all is disturbing.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum (June 21, 2017)</strong></p>
<p>How much plutonium is in that photo?</p>
<p>It’s pretty clearly a sharpie in the bottom of the photo. Sharpies are about 13.5 – 14 cm long. Scaling from there to the rods gives 12 cm long for the top four, and 5.7, 5.1, 4.5, and 3.8 for the bottom four. All have rounded caps of about 0.3 cm radius. I’m approximating, so we’ll neglect the rounded caps. The article says something about the yellow-and-black tape being raised, and the shadows agree, so the lengths of all the rods may be more than what I measured, depending on the angle of the photo. So the estimate is likely to be low, although probably less than tens of grams per rod.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Length (cm)</td>
<td>Radius (cm)</td>
<td># of rods</td>
<td>Mass in g (alpha phase, 19.86 g/cm<sup>3</sup>)</td>
<td>Mass in g (delta phase, 15.92 g/cm<sup>3</sup>)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>12</td>
<td>1.1</td>
<td>4</td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>We can’t tell by looking what phase the plutonium is in, and the densities of the alpha and delta phases are quite different. So a high estimate, for the denser alpha phase, is a total of 4,420 grams in all eight rods; for the less dense delta plutonium, the total is 3,542.</p>
<p>Wikipedia gives the critical mass of plutonium-239 as about 11 kg, about 3 times what is in the photo. But there could be other isotopes. A critical mass depends on its surroundings, so depending what else is in the glovebox and the presence of a human body nearby, the critical mass could be less.</p>
<p>I have additional questions that pertain to the involvement of management and the safety procedures. How did the technician come to have that much plutonium? Plutonium is kept in the vault and must be signed out. Getting a photographer into PF-4 used to require a requisition for the services, and then there are procedural issues about taking a camera in that would have to be signed off by someone above technician level. Who signed off on the photo shoot?</p>
<p>Many thanks to Christopher Willis (@BeCurious) for checking my math, and Alex Wellerstein (@Wellerstein) for doing a parallel estimate.</p>

<h2>OSM is 19 years old: we’re launching an online fundraising campaign to support its future</h2>







<p>18 years ago, OSM Founder Steve Coast posted this invitation to OpenStreetmap’s 1st birthday party.</p>


<div>

<p>In 2005, things were moving very quickly for the still new OSM project. The broader open data movement was gathering momentum through events like the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20051025070025/http://www.okfn.org/wsfii/">World Summit on Free Information Infrastructures (WSFII)</a> and pledge <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20051226062420/http://www.pledgebank.com/geodata">campaigns for the creation of open geodata</a>, and OSM was starting to get coverage in major media like<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050915213226/http://www.guardian.co.uk/online/story/0,3605,1453293,00.html"> the <em>Guardian</em></a>. Soon after the above-mentioned first birthday party, the front end of OSM was launched at OSM.org and a new “whizzy” Applet was launched to “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20051023003100/http://www.openstreetmap.org/news/">replace the horrid old one</a>.”</p>



<p>By 2006, OSM’ers were  mapping all over the world: </p>

<h2>The OSM Birthday Tradition</h2>



<p>When OpenStreetMap turned ten in 2014, the number of celebrations had greatly increased from that first birthday event at the Strongroom Bar in London. In fact, it took a world map to visualize all of the parties. </p>

<p>If you’re celebrating the 19th anniversary of OSM this week, be sure to <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OpenStreetMap_19th_Anniversary_Birthday_party">share some photos.</a> 🎂</p>



<h2>What Does OSM Look Like at 19? </h2>



<p>OpenStreetMap is the largest open-source geospatial project of all time. There are 18 formally established OSM chapters and dozens more local communities, collaborating on hundreds of communication channels, in more than 50 languages, in most of the countries of the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;The map and its data is world-recognized as an essential source of geospatial ground truth. The API is used by millions of people, and the community is motivated,&nbsp; multi-talented, and culturally and geographically diverse. <a href="https://blog.openstreetmap.org/2023/05/22/powering-openstreetmaps-future-a-year-of-improvements-from-openstreetmap-foundations-site-reliability-engineer/">OSM even welcomed its first paid site stability engineer a year ago in recognition of the size and scope of the project.</a></p>

<p>To get an even better sense of what OSM means to its community in 2023, we asked community members to tell us why they love OSM. Here are just a few of the many answers:&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, you can see why this is an important moment for OpenStreetMap.&nbsp; In a year, the project will be twenty years old: its data is helping to solve some of the world’s most pressing challenges, there is new technology that makes it easier to map, and enthusiasm for mapmaking is as strong as it ever was.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To meet these challenges and opportunities, the OSM Foundation board is working on a strategic plan that can help support our ever-growing community of volunteers, by strategically funding skills such as project management, engineering, front-end development and offering bounties and sponsorship to help foster a diverse and inclusive map for everyone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Which is why now is the time to share your time and money to help secure the future of OpenStreetMap.</p>

<p>I want to provide some tips from my experience implementing a paper. I'm going to cover implementing a dramatically scaled-down version of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.13971.pdf">Llama</a> for training <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn/blob/master/data/tinyshakespeare/input.txt">TinyShakespeare</a>. This post is heavily inspired by Karpathy's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ">Makemore series</a>, which I highly recommend.</p>

<p>I'll be skipping over some of the more obvious steps, like setting up a virtual environment and installing dependencies.</p>

<h2 id="always-work-iteratively-start-small-stay-certain-and-build-up">Always work iteratively: start small, stay certain, and build up.</h2>
<p>My approach for implementing papers is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make all of the helper functions required to test your model quantitatively (data splits, training, plotting the loss).</li>
<li>Before you even look at the paper, pick a small, simple, and fast model that you've done in the past. Then make a helper function to evaluate the model qualitatively.</li>
<li>Start by picking apart different components of the paper, and then implementing them one-by-one, training and evaluating as you go.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="make-sure-your-layers-do-what-you-think">Make sure your layers do what you think.</h2>
<ol>
<li>Use <code>.shape</code> religiously. <code>assert</code> and <code>plt.imshow</code> are your friends.</li>
<li>Work out the results without matrix multiplication first, and then use the <code>torch</code> functions to make it efficient after.</li>
<li>Have a test to see that your layer is right. For example, the RoPE embeddings have a specific property that you can test for. For the Transformer, you can test that the attention is working by looking at the attention map.</li>
<li>Test your layers on various batch, sequence, and embedding sizes. Even if it works for one size, it might not work for others, which will cause problems at inference time.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="about-llama">About Llama</h2>
<p>Llama is a transformer-based model for language modeling. Meta AI <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama">open-sourced</a> Llama this summer, and it's gained a lot of attention (pun intended). When you're reading the introduction, they clearly indicate their goal: make a model that's cheaper for running inference, rather than optimizing training costs.</p>
<p>At this point, we'll just load our libraries and get started.</p>

<p>Since our dataset is small enough, we don't need to worry about how we store it in memory etc.</p>
<p>First tip: I'm creating a <code>config</code> object that stores some basic model params. It makes our code way more readable and removes constants and magic numbers from the code. I'm not going to use types, as  I want to keep things flexible for now and be able to add more parameters later on.</p>

<p>Let's create a method to generate our training data and labels for batches. We'll use the same method for validation and test data. Note that I like to test my functions in the same block that I define them, just to make sure they work as expected before moving on.</p>

<p>What's interesting about implementing papers is that there are two aspects to the model <em>working</em>: compilation (do your tensors all match up from layer to layer), and training (does the loss go down). Figuring out how to ensure that each of your components is working is key to developing your model in a predictable, engineering-minded way.</p>
<p>That's why we're also going to define the method for how we're going to evaluate the model. We want to do this before we even define the model, because we want to be able to use it to evaluate the model as we're training it.</p>

<p>Here's a basic feed-forward neural network with embeddings. It's the base model we're going to start with, and then swap out parts of it as we go along until we eventually end up with the model as described in Llama.</p>

<p>It's at this point that we have to start worrying about the shape of our tensors and making indices match. Check out this line of our model definition:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>loss</span> <span>=</span> <span>F</span><span>.</span><span>cross_entropy</span><span>(</span><span>logits</span><span>.</span><span>view</span><span>(</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>config</span><span>[</span><span>'vocab_size'</span><span>]),</span> <span>targets</span><span>.</span><span>view</span><span>(</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>))</span>
</pre></div>

<p>We have to reshape the <code>logits</code> and <code>targets</code> tensors so that their dimensions match when we compare. We do this with the <code>view</code> method. The <code>-1</code> argument means "infer this dimension from the others". So, in this case, we're saying "reshape <code>logits</code> and <code>targets</code> to have the same number of rows, and however many columns are needed to make that happen". This is a common pattern when you're working with batches of data.</p>
<p>Alright, let's train our <code>SimpleBrokenModel</code> to make sure gradients flow. After we confirm that, we can swap out parts of it to match Llama, train again, and track our progress. It's at this point that I start keeping a <em>log</em> of my training runs, so that I can easily just go back to a previous run in the event that I mess something up.</p>

<p>Notice how we get a training curve that goes down, but barely by anything. How do we know it's barely training? We have to use first principles. The cross-entropy loss before training is 4.17, and after 1000 epochs is 3.93. How can we make sense of it intuitively?</p>
<p>Cross-entropy in this context is referring to how likely we are to pick the wrong word. So here,</p>
<p><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><mrow><mi>H</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>T</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>q</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><mo>−</mo><msubsup><mo>∑</mo><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mrow><mi>N</mi></mrow></msubsup><mfrac><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><mrow><mi>N</mi></mrow></mfrac><mi>log</mi><mi>q</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></math></p>
<p>where $q(x_i)$ is the probability of picking the right word, as estimated by the model. If $q(x_i)$ is close to 1, then $\log q$ is close to 0; similarly, if $q$ is small, then $\log q$ is a large negative number, so $-\log q$ will be a large positive number. Now to build the intuition: to start, $-\log q = 4.17$, so $q = 0.015$, or around $\frac{1}{64.715}$. Recall that the vocabulary size $|V| = 65$, so what we're basically saying here is that the model is as good at choosing the next letter as randomly picking from our vocabulary. After training, $-\log q = 3.93$, so we're now basically choosing between 50 letters. This is a very small improvement, so something is probably wrong.</p>
<p>To get an intuition for how the loss relates to the model's performance, think about the model choosing among $\tilde V$ tokens; when $\tilde V$ is small, the model is more likely to guess right. In addition, we know $\max \tilde V = V$, which can help us understand if our model is learning at all.</p>

<p>Let's try to debug what's going on. Notice that in our model we're using a softmax layer on our logits, which is a function that takes a vector of numbers and squashes them into a probability distribution. But for using the built in <code>F.cross_entropy</code> function, we need to pass in the <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy.html">unnormalized logits directly</a>. So let's remove that from our model and try again.</p>

<p>It's not half bad, but also not half good. But now we have a working model that is training to a validation loss. So here we'll iterate on our model to make it closer to Llama.</p>
<h2 id="llama-specifics">Llama specifics</h2>
<p>Llama describes three architectural modifications to the original Transformer:</p>
<ol>
<li>RMSNorm for pre-normalization</li>
<li>Rotary embeddings</li>
<li>SwiGLU activation function</li>
</ol>
<p>We're going to add each one, one at a time to our base model, and iterate.</p>
<h3 id="rmsnorm">RMSNorm</h3>
<p>In Vaswani 2017, the original transformer uses BatchNormalization. In Llama, the authors use RMSNorm, which is where you scale the bector by the variance without centering it. In addition, while Vaswani applies normalization to the output of the attention layer (post-normalization), Llama applies it to the inputs before (pre-normalization).</p>

<p>We want to test to ensure that the RMSNorm is doing what we think it should. We can do this the old-fashioned way: row-wise comparisons. The RMSNorm has the property where the norm of the layer will be the square root of the number of elements in the layer, so we can check that for every layer.</p>

<h3 id="rotary-embeddings">Rotary Embeddings</h3>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.09864.pdf">RoPE</a> is a kind of positional encoding for transformers. In Attention is All You Need, the authors propose two kinds of positional encodings, learned and fixed. In RoPE, the authors propose embedding the position of a token in a sequence by rotating the embedding, with a different rotation at each position.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tip here: know the difference between tensor dimensions at train time vs tensor dimensions at inference time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although at train time, you can expect your tensor dimensions to match your model parameters closely, eg <code>batch.shape = (config['batch_size'], config['context_window'], config['d_model'])</code>, at inference time, you may have to deal with a single example, eg <code>batch.shape = (1, 1, config['d_model'])</code>. For this reason, you need to make sure that when you're indexing in the <code>forward</code> pass, you're indexing using shapes derived from the input, not necessarily the model parameters.</p>
<p>Let's make sure it does what we think it does. For this layer, we're going to want to test three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>that it rotates embeddings the way we think it does</li>
<li>that the attention mask used for causal attention is working properly.</li>

<p>Even at an extremely low tolerance, the attention biases are not getting any signal. I'm not sure why the learning schedule from the paper doesn't work, but the lesson here is simple: start simple.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="http://omrelli.ug/g9/gallery/">http://omrelli.ug/g9/gallery/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37058674">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">

<a href="https://github.com/bijection/g9" id="github"><img src="http://omrelli.ug/g9/github.png" alt="Spoon me on GitHub"></a>


<div class="page">
    

    <p>Welcome to the g9 gallery! <b>Drag all the graphics!</b></p>
    <p>I've tried to organize stuff from basic to advanced, so you can scroll from the top to get an intuitive feel for g9. It's worth mentioning, of course, that intuitive feeling is no match for <a href="https://github.com/bijection/g9#docs">reading the docs</a>.</p>

    <p>Before you dive in, here's a brief explanation of how g9 works (scroll down to skip):</p>


    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>
    g9.js exposes a single function, <a href="https://github.com/bijection/g9#g9initialdata-render-onrender-g9canvas"><span>g9(initialData, render[, onChange])</span></a>. This represents the following flow: 
    </p><ol>
    
    <li>
        You create some initial data as key-value pairs with numeric values. For example:
<pre><code>var initialData = {
    foo: 10
}</code></pre>
    <a href="https://github.com/bijection/g9#initialdata">initialData in the docs</a>
    </li>

    <li>
        This data and a drawing context are fed into a function that uses the data to decide what to draw.
<pre><code>function render(data, ctx){
    ctx.point(data.foo, 17)
}</code></pre>
    <a href="https://github.com/bijection/g9#renderdata-ctx-g9context">render in the docs</a>
    </li>
    
    <li>When someone interacts with the graphics, for example by trying to drag an element to a new position, g9 optimizes over the space of possible values for your data to find a set of values that comes closest to creating the change. If you tried to drag the circle to the left, g9 might come up with the new data <span>{foo: 8 }</span>.</li>
    
    <li>g9 rerenders the entire scene with the new data, so that everything is consistent. If you've provided one, g9 calls your <span>onChange</span> callback with the new data, so you can update other parts of your page.</li>
    
    </ol>
    
    <p>For a complete treatment of the g9 API, <a href="https://github.com/bijection/g9#docs">head to the Docs</a>.</p>



    <!-- <p>In order to avoid repetion, every example gets a special function <span class='literal'>_special_log</span> that shows its arguments in a floating box.</p> -->



</div>











<div class="page">
<h2>Basic</h2>
<p>A minimal example with only two points. Our render function always draws one point at (x, y), and the other point at (y, x), so when you drag one of the points, the other kind of mirrors it. Try adding a minus sign before the first argument of the first point. What happens?</p>
</div>

















<div class="page">
<h2>Rings</h2>
<p>Lets add a few more points and use a bit or trigonometry to arrange them into two circles. Just for fun, we make the inner points red. Try dragging the points!</p>
</div>















<div class="page">
<h2>The affects option</h2>
<p>All of the default shapes in g9 accept an <span>affects</span> option, which tells them what parts of the data they can change. Here are three lines with different values of <span>affects</span>.</p>
</div>

stores it as <code>static const _PyRuntimeState initial = _PyRuntimeState_INIT;</code>
and this <code>initial</code> variable is used when when the interpreter is initialized.</p></div></div><div><h3 id="module-code">2.2. Module code</h3><div><div><p>Back to the code for our module — we want to modify a couple of the elements of <code>small_ints[]</code>, but we do not have direct access to it.
We can use the API declared in <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/d2340ef25721b6a72d45d4508c672c4be38c67d3/Include/longobject.h#L16">longobject.h</a> — namely, the following function that gives the <code>PyObject</code> for a given <code>long</code> (plain <code>C</code>) value: <code>PyAPI_FUNC(PyObject *) PyLong_FromLong(long)</code>.</p><p>Its definition is in <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/d2340ef25721b6a72d45d4508c672c4be38c67d3/Objects/longobject.c#L287"><code>longobject.c</code></a>. We can see that it checks for small integers (<code>IS_SMALL_INT(ival)</code>) and then calls <code>get_small_int((sdigit)ival)</code>, which returns <code>_PyLong_SMALL_INTS[_PY_NSMALLNEGINTS + ival]</code>.</p><p>Finally, in <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/d2340ef25721b6a72d45d4508c672c4be38c67d3/Include/internal/pycore_long.h#L58"><code>pycore_long.h</code></a>, you can see that this refers to the <code>small_ints[]</code> array: <code>#define _PyLong_SMALL_INTS _Py_SINGLETON(small_ints)</code>.</p><p>Now, we have the first part of our code. It will get the references to the two integers we care about:</p></div><div><pre><span></span><span>PyLongObject</span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>obj8</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>PyLongObject</span><span>*</span><span>)</span><span>PyLong_FromLong</span><span>(</span><span>8</span><span>);</span>

</pre></div><div><p>How do we change the value?</p><p><code>Python</code> <code>int</code> (and <code>CPython</code> <code>PyLongObject</code>) represent arbitrarily large integers (positive or negative). <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/d2340ef25721b6a72d45d4508c672c4be38c67d3/Include/cpython/longintrepr.h#L64">longintrepr.h</a> defines how integers are stored.

<span>   The absolute value of a number is equal to</span>
<span>        SUM(for i=0 through abs(ob_size)-1) ob_digit[i] * 2**(SHIFT*i)</span>
<span>   Negative numbers are represented with ob_size &lt; 0;</span>
<span>   zero is represented by ob_size == 0.</span>
<span>   In a normalized number, ob_digit[abs(ob_size)-1] (the most significant</span>
<span>   digit) is never zero.  Also, in all cases, for all valid i,</span>
<span>        0 &lt;= ob_digit[i] &lt;= MASK.</span>
<span>   The allocation function takes care of allocating extra memory</span>
<span>   so that ob_digit[0] ... ob_digit[abs(ob_size)-1] are actually available.</span>
<span>   We always allocate memory for at least one digit, so accessing ob_digit[0]</span>
<span>   is always safe. However, in the case ob_size == 0, the contents of</span>
<span>   ob_digit[0] may be undefined.</span>

Notes</h3><div><div><p>If you import this module and continue working, it will likely eventually lead to a complete crash of the interpreter (i.e.&nbsp;suddenly exit and print something like <code>Segmentation fault (core dumped)</code> — as opposed to simply raising a <code>Python</code> <code>Exception</code>).</p><p>I found this out in a few ways,</p><ul><li><p>My original test was to redefine all small integers by shifting each of them, <code>n =&gt; n+1</code>.

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">FOREWORD</h2>
<p dir="auto">A collection of pure <code>bash</code> alternatives to external processes and programs. The <code>bash</code> scripting language is more powerful than people realise and most tasks can be accomplished without depending on external programs.</p>
<p dir="auto">Calling an external process in <code>bash</code> is expensive and excessive use will cause a noticeable slowdown. Scripts and programs written using built-in methods (<em>where applicable</em>) will be faster, require fewer dependencies and afford a better understanding of the language itself.</p>
<p dir="auto">The contents of this book provide a reference for solving problems encountered when writing programs and scripts in <code>bash</code>. Examples are in function formats showcasing how to incorporate these solutions into code.</p>


<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">STRINGS</h2>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Trim leading and trailing white-space from string</h2>
<p dir="auto">This is an alternative to <code>sed</code>, <code>awk</code>, <code>perl</code> and other tools. The
function below works by finding all leading and trailing white-space and
removing it from the start and end of the string. The <code>:</code> built-in is used in place of a temporary variable.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Example Function:</strong></p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="trim_string() {
    # Usage: trim_string &quot;   example   string    &quot;

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Use regex on a string</h2>

<section id="introduction">
<h2 data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><a href="https://christianjmills.com/posts/arc-a770-testing/part-1/">Last October</a>, I wrote about my findings from testing the inference performance of Intel’s <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/229151/intel-arc-a770-graphics-16gb/specifications.html">Arc A770</a> GPU using <a href="https://docs.openvino.ai/2022.3/home.html">OpenVINO</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/ai/directml/dml">DirectML</a>. I also attempted to train various models with the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pytorch-directml/">PyTorch-DirectML</a> package. The card did well on inference, especially with Intel’s OpenVINO library. However, the PyTorch-DirectML package was incomplete, and I could not adequately test the card’s training performance.</p>
<p>Shortly after that post, Intel released an <a href="https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-pytorch/releases/tag/v1.10.200%2Bgpu">extension for PyTorch</a>, which added support for Intel GPUs. Based on my initial testing, I decided the extension was not in a state that warranted a follow-up post. In hindsight, I don’t believe the initial release officially supported Arc GPUs. The <a href="https://intel.github.io/intel-extension-for-pytorch/xpu/1.10.200+gpu/tutorials/installation.html#hardware-requirement">installation guide</a> for that version only mentions data center GPUs.</p>
<p>Since then, Intel has released a couple of updates for the extension, the most <a href="https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-pytorch/releases/tag/v1.13.120%2Bxpu">recent</a> being about a month ago at the time of writing. Unlike the initial release, this version lists Arc GPUs as having <a href="https://intel.github.io/intel-extension-for-pytorch/xpu/1.13.120+xpu/tutorials/installation.html#hardware-requirement">experimental support</a>. Given that and the driver improvements for Windows and Linux, I decided to pop the A770 back into my desktop and give it another shot. In short, it works now.</p>
<p>In this post, I discuss my experience getting Intel’s PyTorch extension running on Ubuntu and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). I also cover my initial findings from training models. I’ll provide a tutorial for setting up and using the extension in a dedicated post.</p>

<section id="initial-headaches">
<h2 data-anchor-id="initial-headaches">Initial Headaches</h2>
<p>To be blunt, my initial attempts to get this working were a bit of a nightmare. The instructions required to enable support for Arc GPUs on Ubuntu and set up Intel’s PyTorch extension span across multiple sites and are sometimes contradictory. The instructions on some sites are outdated to the point of being impossible to follow.</p>
<p>For example, Intel’s Arc Graphics Driver for Ubuntu <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/747008/intel-arc-graphics-driver-ubuntu.html">page</a> provided a link to a separate documentation site with driver installation instructions.</p>
<div>
<figure>
<p><img src="https://christianjmills.com/posts/arc-a770-testing/part-2/images/intel-arc-graphics-driver-ubuntu-page.png"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The instructions on the documentation site say to <a href="https://dgpu-docs.intel.com/installation-guides/ubuntu/ubuntu-jammy-arc.html#step-2-install-linux-kernel">install a specific Linux kernel</a>, <code>5.19.0-35</code>, which is <a href="https://www.ubuntuupdates.org/package/core/jammy/main/updates/linux-image-5.19.0-35-generic">no longer available</a>.</p>
<div>
<figure>
<p><img src="https://christianjmills.com/posts/arc-a770-testing/part-2/images/intel-dgpu-docs-ubuntu-driver-installation-instructions-install-kernel.png"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Still, I attempted to follow the instructions on a new Ubuntu 22.04 install and a more recent <code>5.19</code> kernel. Trying to boot into Ubuntu on the Arc card with the <code>5.19</code> kernel results in the following error:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>snd_hda_intel</span> 0000:04:00.0 hsw/bdw hd-audio hdmi/dp requires binding with gfx driver</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The error is a known issue, and Intel even has a <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000092607/graphics.html">troubleshooting page</a> with a proposed workaround. Unfortunately, disabling the “Integrated graphics Multi-Monitor” BIOS option, as the page recommends, did not resolve the issue.</p>
<p>I decided to continue following the instructions on integrated graphics and see if I could use the Arc card once I installed all the driver packages. That attempt went so poorly that I had to pop out the motherboard’s CMOS battery to reset the BIOS.</p>
<p>I made several more attempts, which failed at various stages. Fortunately, I eventually got everything working, and my current setup process is pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>I ended up needing Linux kernel <code>6.2</code> or newer. That kernel version <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.2-Released">supports the Arc card</a> out of the box. You can install that kernel on Ubuntu 22.04, but I recommend just going with Ubuntu 23.04 (or newer) if starting from a fresh install. Ubuntu 23.04 already has a kernel version <code>≥6.2</code>, and I verified it works with Intel’s PyTorch extension.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, I’ll provide detailed instructions for the setup process in a dedicated post.</p>

<section id="training-performance-on-native-ubuntu">
<h2 data-anchor-id="training-performance-on-native-ubuntu">Training Performance on Native Ubuntu</h2>
<p>I used the training notebook from my recent <a href="https://christianjmills.com/posts/pytorch-train-image-classifier-timm-hf-tutorial/">beginner PyTorch tutorial</a> for testing. That tutorial covers fine-tuning image classification models with PyTorch and the timm library by creating a hand gesture recognizer. Using the training notebook simplifies directly comparing the Arc A770 and my Titan RTX, which I used to create the tutorial. Nearly everything is identical for the testing environment down to the dataset location.</p>
<p>The one additional variable is that the tutorial uses PyTorch 2.0, while Intel’s PyTorch extension currently requires a <a href="https://intel.github.io/intel-extension-for-pytorch/xpu/latest/tutorials/installation.html#pytorch-intel-extension-for-pytorch-version-mapping">patched version</a> of PyTorch 1.13. However, I don’t use model compilation in the tutorial, so this should not be a significant factor.</p>
<p>The training notebook only required a few tweaks to use Intel’s PyTorch extension, with most of the code remaining unchanged. The extension even supports PyTorch’s <code>autocast()</code> context manager for mixed-precision training.</p>
<p>The first training session was alarmingly slow, with the first pass through the training set taking around 42 minutes and 30 seconds. However, the loss and accuracy values were comparable to those with the Titan RTX, so I let it run for a while. After the first epoch, passes through the training set fell to approximately 16 minutes and 50 seconds. The total training time was only a few minutes less than the free GPU tier on Google Colab. Strangely, the inference speed on the validation set was nearly identical to the Titan RTX.</p>
<div>

</figure>
</div>
<p>We can get more insight into using the <code>intel-gpu-top</code> command-line tool. Below are the readouts from the first and third passes through the training set:</p>
<div>
<ul role="tablist"><li role="presentation"><a id="tabset-1-1-tab" data-bs-toggle="tab" data-bs-target="#tabset-1-1" role="tab" aria-controls="tabset-1-1" aria-selected="true">First Pass</a></li><li role="presentation"><a id="tabset-1-2-tab" data-bs-toggle="tab" data-bs-target="#tabset-1-2" role="tab" aria-controls="tabset-1-2" aria-selected="false">Third Pass</a></li></ul>

</figure>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Note that the memory throughput for the first training pass is particularly low. Although, the third pass is not great, either.</p>
<p>After some investigation on the <a href="https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-pytorch/issues/296#issuecomment-1426537682">extension’s GitHub repository</a>, it appears the slow training time is due to the backward pass for some operations. Fortunately, the fix involved setting a <a href="https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-pytorch/issues/296#issuecomment-1461118993">single environment variable</a>.</p>
<p>After setting <code>IPEX_XPU_ONEDNN_LAYOUT=1</code>, the total training time is within 10% of my Titan RTX on the same system. The gap would be slightly wider if I compiled the model on the Titan with PyTorch 2.0.</p>
<p>We can see the difference with <code>intel-gpu-top</code>, which shows much higher memory throughput.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>The final loss and accuracy values fluctuate slightly, even when using fixed seed values for PyTorch, NumPy, and Python. However, they stay pretty close to the results on my Nvidia GPU.</p>
<p>Here is a screenshot of the training session with the Arc A770:</p>

<p>The training sessions for the A770 and the Titan both used mixed precision.</p>
<p>I also tested training on the Arc card with the newer 6.3 Linux kernel but did not see a notable performance difference versus the 6.2 Linux kernel.</p>
<p>Since Intel’s extension only recently added support for Arc cards, more performance may get unlocked in future updates. However, getting so close to the Titan RTX was already more than I had hoped.</p>
<p>I decided to move on and see how the extension performed in WSL.</p>
</section>
<section id="training-performance-on-wsl">
<h2 data-anchor-id="training-performance-on-wsl">Training Performance on WSL</h2>
<p>Now that I had a streamlined process for setting everything up on Ubuntu, getting WSL up and running was easy. It only required a subset of the steps compared to a bare-metal Ubuntu installation. I used the default <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/ubuntu/9PDXGNCFSCZV">Ubuntu terminal environment</a> and stuck with the included kernel.</p>
<p>Total training time in WSL is <code>≈34%</code> slower than in native Ubuntu with the dataset in the same virtual hard disk (VHD) that stores the WSL-Ubuntu install.</p>
<div>
<figure>
<p><img src="https://christianjmills.com/posts/arc-a770-testing/part-2/images/arc-a770-pytorch-training-session-wsl.png"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>I remember getting a similar performance hit the last time I used WSL with the Titan RTX. It’s one of the reasons I prefer to dual-boot Windows and Ubuntu.</p>
<p>Here is a screenshot of the GPU usage when running the training notebook on the A770 in WSL:</p>
<div>
<figure>
<p><img src="https://christianjmills.com/posts/arc-a770-testing/part-2/images/task-manager-pytorch-arc-a770-wsl-gpu-usage.png"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>There is an additional <code>≈20%</code> increase in training time when storing the dataset outside the VHD with the WSL-Ubuntu install.</p>
<div>
<figure>
<p><img src="https://christianjmills.com/posts/arc-a770-testing/part-2/images/arc-a770-pytorch-training-session-wsl-external-dataset.png"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>One workaround is to <a href="https://woshub.com/move-wsl-another-drive-windows/">move the WSL installation</a> to a larger drive if your <code>C</code> drive has limited space.</p>
<p>The performance hit makes it hard to recommend WSL for deep learning tasks. On top of that, the <a href="https://christianjmills.com/posts/pytorch-cuda-wsl2/#the-headaches">issues</a> I encountered when I first tested using PyTorch on WSL2 in 2020 are still present, at least on Windows 10.</p>
<p>Therefore, I recommend using a bare-metal installation to get the most out of your hardware. The Ubuntu website provides <a href="https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop#1-overview">a step-by-step guide</a> to installing Ubuntu on your PC, and you can install it alongside an existing operating system.</p>
</section>
<section id="closing-thoughts">
<h2 data-anchor-id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>
<p>My experience with the PyTorch-DirectML package and the first version of Intel’s extension left me thinking it would be a while before the Arc GPUs became viable options for deep learning.</p>
<p>Several months later, my initial attempts to get everything working last week had me thinking it would be even longer still. Fortunately, once you know the proper steps, setting everything up is relatively straightforward.</p>
<p>While there is much more testing to do, I believe the Arc GPUs are now credible options for deep learning.</p>
<p>There are likely still edge cases or certain operations that cause problems, and I’ll make updates to this post if I encounter any. I’ll also try to keep the <a href="https://christianjmills.com/posts/intel-pytorch-extension-tutorial/native-ubuntu/">setup tutorial</a> updated as new versions of Intel’s PyTorch extension come out.</p>

  <p>Today, practically every operating system, language ecosystem, and framework has one or more package managers. Package managers are a, if not the, major way of taming software complexity, integrating various ecosystems, components, and versions and ensuring they are managed (installed/updated/uninstalled) safely, reliably, and in a compatible manner on user systems.</p><p>Because package managers bridge the gap between developers and the end user, developing them requires a broad range of expertise in multiple areas, including language runtimes, OS policies, distribution management, dependency solving, and developer workflows.</p><p>Packaging Con seeks to bring various package management communities together, as a venue to discuss challenges and exchange ideas. What makes communities work together on a particular software ecosystem? Are the differences among package managers mainly in the implementation language, or are there other key distinctions to software management methodology? How can we get better interoperability and/or cooperation among package manager teams, and what's missing/required to enable that? Is dependency resolution fundamentally the same problem across systems, or does each package manager do it differently?</p><p>If any of these questions interest you, we want to hear from you! Packaging Con is a conference for developers of software package management tools, as well as software packagers and communities! Anyone is welcome to participate. Our mission is to bring different software ecosystems together: from Python’s pip to Rust’s cargo, from apt, rpm, and Nix to conda and mamba, and from vcpkg to spack, and from fpm to npm.</p><p><strong>Topics</strong></p><p>We encourage submissions in a wide range of areas related to package management, including but not limited to:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Deep dives on specific packaging systems</p></li><li><p>Software supply chains, pipelines, and security</p></li><li><p>Package build and release methodologies</p></li><li><p>Modeling software ecosystems in package managers</p></li><li><p>Modeling compatibility (semver, API/ABI analysis, etc.)</p></li><li><p>Interactions between package managers</p></li><li><p>Reproducibility in package managers</p></li><li><p>Reliability/robustness of software ecosystems</p></li><li><p>Dependency solving and management: modeling, methods, and scalability</p></li></ul><p>This list is by no means exhaustive — any topic related to package management is welcome to attend.<br></p><p><strong>Code of Conduct</strong></p><p>In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, pledge to make participation in Packaging Con a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.</p><p>By participating in the conference you agree to abide to the <a href="https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct" target="_blank">NumFOCUS Code of Conduct</a>.</p>

      <h4>2023-08-08</h4>
    </header>

    <p>
      You've done it. You've launched the next great feature. You've spent months working with your team to design, build, and test. It's
      in users' hands. You're done.
    </p>

    <p>But are you really? Probably not.</p>

    <p>I've seen (and been on) so many projects that claim success and move on to the next thing when they are 99% done and fail to 
      complete the last 1%. This last 1% isn't just what separates a great product from a good product, it's what separates a product that
      <i>might not</i> eventually fail from one that <i>will</i> eventually fail.
    </p>

    <p>
      So what's in this last 1%? Here are some of the most frequently skipped things I've seen:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Internal (maintenance) documentation</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>External (how-to/FAQ) documentation</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Performance metric instrumentation</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Easy-to-decipher performance metric dashboard</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Usage metric instrumentation</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Easy-to-decipher usage metric dashboard</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Error metric instrumentation</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Easy-to-decipher error metric dashboard</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Alerting</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Automated testing</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I know the temptation. I've been there many times myself. After months of hard work and sleepless nights, you want to put it behind
      you and move on to the next thing. But don't. Take the time to finish the last 1%. It's worth it.
    </p>

  <p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/la-fda-aprueba-el-primer-tratamiento-oral-para-la-depresion-posparto"><span>Spanish</span></a></p>

<p>Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved <a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2023/217369s000lbl.pdf">Zurzuvae</a> (zuranolone), the first oral medication indicated to treat postpartum depression (PPD) in adults. PPD is a major depressive episode that typically occurs after childbirth but can also begin during the later stages of pregnancy. Until now, treatment for PPD was only available as an IV injection given by a health care provider in certain health care facilities.</p>

<p><strong>“Postpartum depression is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition in which women experience sadness, guilt, worthlessness—even, in severe cases, thoughts of harming themselves or their child. And, because postpartum depression can disrupt the maternal-infant bond, it can also have consequences for the child’s physical and emotional development,” said Tiffany R. Farchione, M.D., director of the Division of Psychiatry in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “Having access to an oral medication will be a beneficial option for many of these women coping with extreme, and sometimes life-threatening, feelings.”</strong></p>

<p>As with other forms of depression, PPD is characterized by sadness and/or loss of interest in activities that one used to enjoy and a decreased ability to feel pleasure. It can present with symptoms such as cognitive impairment, feelings of sadness or inadequacy, loss of energy or suicidal ideation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The efficacy of Zurzuvae for the treatment of PPD in adults was demonstrated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter studies. The trial participants were women with PPD who met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria for a major depressive episode and whose symptoms began in the third trimester or within four weeks of delivery. In Study 1, patients received 50 mg of Zurzuvae or placebo once daily in the evening for 14 days. In Study 2, patients received another zuranolone product that was approximately equal to 40 mg of Zurzuvae or placebo, also for 14 days. Patients in both studies were monitored for at least four weeks after the 14-day treatment. The primary endpoint of both studies was the change in depressive symptoms using the total score from the 17-item Hamilton depression rating scale (HAMD-17), measured at day 15. Patients in the Zurzuvae groups showed significantly more improvement in their symptoms compared to those in the placebo groups. The treatment effect was maintained at Day 42—four weeks after the last dose of Zurzuvae.</p>

<p>The labeling contains a boxed warning noting that Zurzuvae can impact a person’s ability to drive and perform other potentially hazardous activities. Patients also may not be able to assess their degree of impairment. To reduce the risk of harm, patients should not drive or operate heavy machinery for at least 12 hours after taking Zurzuvae.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The most common side effects include drowsiness, dizziness, diarrhea, fatigue, nasopharyngitis (the common cold), and urinary tract infection. Use of Zurzuvae may cause suicidal thoughts and behavior. Zurzuvae may cause fetal harm. Women should use effective contraception while taking, and for one week after taking, Zurzuvae.</p>

<p>The daily recommended dose for Zurzuvae is 50mg. It should be taken once every day, for 14 days, in the evening with a fatty meal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The FDA granted this application <a href="https://www.fda.gov/patients/fast-track-breakthrough-therapy-accelerated-approval-priority-review/priority-review">Priority Review</a> and <a href="https://www.fda.gov/patients/fast-track-breakthrough-therapy-accelerated-approval-priority-review/fast-track">Fast Track</a> designation.</p>

<p>Approval of Zurzuvae was granted to Sage Therapeutics, Inc.</p>

<p>A practical explanation of how weak entropy can ruin your day - and your savings.</p>

<ul>
  <li>We discovered a cryptographic weakness in the widely utilized <code>Libbitcoin Explorer</code> (<code>bx</code>) cryptocurrency wallet tool while following up on mysterious wallet thefts.</li>
  <li>The <code>bx seed</code> subcommand for generation of new wallet private key entropy is flawed and produces insecure output.</li>
  <li>On <code>Libbitcoin Explorer</code> <code>3.x</code> versions, <code>bx seed</code> uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_Twister#Disadvantages">Mersenne Twister</a> pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) <a href="https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-system/blob/a1b777fc51d9c04e0c7a1dec5cc746b82a6afe64/src/crypto/pseudo_random.cpp#L77">initialized</a> with 32 bits of system time.</li>
  <li>Bad actors have discovered this flaw and are actively exploiting it to steal funds from affected wallets on multiple blockchains.</li>
  <li>We have reasons to believe some <code>Libbitcoin Explorer</code> versions before <code>3.0.0</code> also produce weak <code>bx seed</code> output in some system environments.</li>
  <li>Think of this as securing your online bank account with a password manager that creates a long random password, but it often creates the same passwords for every user. Malicious people have figured this out and drained funds on any account they can find.</li>
</ul>

    </p>
</div>
<ul>
  <li>Popular documentation like “<a href="https://bitcoinbook.info/">Mastering Bitcoin</a>” suggests the usage of <code>bx seed</code> for wallet generation.</li>
  <li>Secure cryptography requires a source of large, non-guessable numbers. If the random number generator is weak, the resulting cryptographic usage is almost always compromised.</li>
  <li>For technical people: in this case, practical wallet security is reduced from 128 bit, 192 bit or 256 bit to a mere 32 bit of unknown key information.</li>
  <li>A 32 bit key space is 2^32, or 4,294,967,296 different unique combinations of derived <a href="https://milksad.info/(https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0039)">BIP39</a> mnemonic phrases or other key formats (<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0032">BIP32</a>). Spoiler: That’s not as many combinations as it sounds.</li>
  <li>With enough optimizations, a decent gaming PC can do a brute-force search through 2^32 wallet combinations in less than a day.</li>
  <li>Since <code>bx</code> has a configurable output length and can be used in several ways, there are a few variations the attacker needs to test for each case. This slows down practical attacks to a few days.</li>
  <li>Once an attacker finds a match of a wallet candidate with an actual wallet used on a blockchain, they are in full possession of the private keys and can steal remaining funds, trace all previous wallet history and sign messages.</li>
  <li>The attack works independent of the owner’s current copy of the wallet secrets. In other words, even if you keep your paper wallet in a bank safe, your funds can still be stolen remotely. Crazy, right?</li>
  <li>Attackers are actively exploiting this and have been draining funds of wallets where the mnemonic was generated using this tool.</li>
  <li>Why the silly “Milk Sad” name? Running <code>bx seed</code> on <code>3.x</code> versions with a system time of 0.0 always generates the following secret:
    <blockquote>
      <p>milk sad wage cup reward umbrella raven visa give list decorate bulb gold raise twenty fly manual stand float super gentle climb fold park</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="when">When?</h2>
<p>The main theft occurred around 12 July 2023, although initial exploitation likely began at a smaller scale in May 2023.</p>

<p>A separate but similar vulnerability in another wallet software was detected in November 2022 and actively exploited shortly after, which may be the prequel to this story.</p>

<h2 id="who">Who?</h2>
<p>We did not identify who is behind the ongoing thefts from vulnerable wallets.</p>
