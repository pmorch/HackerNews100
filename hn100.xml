<p dir="auto">It turns out that MacOS Tahoe can generate and use secure-enclave backed SSH keys! This replaces projects like <a href="https://github.com/maxgoedjen/secretive">https://github.com/maxgoedjen/secretive</a></p>
<p dir="auto">There is a shared library <code>/usr/lib/ssh-keychain.dylib</code> that traditionally has been used to add smartcard support
to ssh by implementing <code>PKCS11Provider</code> interface. However since recently it also implements <code>SecurityKeyProivder</code>
which supports loading keys directly from the secure enclave! <code>SecurityKeyProvider</code> is what is normally used to talk to FIDO2 devices (e.g. <code>libfido2</code> can be used to talk to your Yubikey). However you can now use it to talk to your Secure Enclave instead!</p>

    <div>
        <p>I’m not saying this will definitely happen, but I think we could be on the cusp of a significant shift in Windows market share for consumer computers. It is not going to drop to 2% in a year or anything, but I feel like a few pieces are coming together that could move the needle in a way we have not seen in several decades. There are three things on my mind .</p><p>Number one is that Microsoft just does not feel like a consumer tech company at all anymore. Yes, they have always been much more corporate than the likes of Apple or Google, but it really shows in the last few years as they seem to only have energy for AI and web services. If you are not a customer who is a major business or a developer creating the next AI-powered app, Microsoft does not seem to care about you.</p><p>I just do not see excitement there. The only thing of note they have added to Windows in the last five years is Copilot, and I have yet to meet a normal human being who enjoys using it. And all the Windows 11 changes seem to have just gone over about as well as a lead balloon. I just do not think they care at all about Windows with consumers.</p><p>The second thing is the affordable MacBook rumored to be coming out in 2026. This will be a meaningfully cheaper MacBook that people can purchase at price points that many Windows computers have been hovering around for many years. Considering Apple’s focus on consumers first and a price point that can get more people in the door, it seems like that could move the needle.</p><p>The third thing is gamers. Gamers use Windows largely because they have to, not because they are passionate about it. Maybe they were passionate about it in the 90s, but any passion has gone away. Now it is just the operating system they use to launch Steam. In early 2026, Valve is going to release the Steam Machine after a few years of success with the Steam Deck. We will see how they do there, but what they are doing is releasing a machine that runs Windows games on Linux. And it runs them really well. The Steam Deck has proven that over the last few years. If someone can package up a version of Linux that is optimized for gamers, then I think there is a meaningful number of PC gamers who would happily run that on their computer instead.</p><p>I do not know if this is going to happen. It is always easy to be cynical and suggest everything will stay the same, and I understand that markets of this size take a long time to change. However, it just feels like there are some things happening right now that are going to move the needle, and I am excited to see what happens.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article id="article-body"><p data-testid="paragraph-content">Sex trafficking on Meta platforms was both difficult to report and widely tolerated, according to a court filing unsealed Friday. In a plaintiffs’ brief filed as part of a major lawsuit against four social media companies, Instagram’s former head of safety and well-being Vaishnavi Jayakumar testified that when she joined Meta in 2020 she was shocked to learn that the company had a “17x” strike policy for accounts that reportedly engaged in the “trafficking of humans for sex.”&nbsp;</p><div><p data-testid="paragraph-content">“You could incur 16 violations for prostitution and sexual solicitation, and upon the 17th violation, your account would be suspended,” Jayakumar reportedly testified, adding that “by any measure across the industry, [it was] a very, very high strike threshold.” The plaintiffs claim that this testimony is corroborated by internal company documentation.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">The brief, filed by plaintiffs in the Northern District of California, alleges that Meta was aware of serious harms on its platform and engaged in a broad pattern of deceit to downplay risks to young users. According to the brief, Meta was aware that millions of adult strangers were contacting minors on its sites; that its products exacerbated mental health issues in teens; and that content related to eating disorders, suicide, and child sexual abuse was frequently detected, yet rarely removed. According to the brief, the company failed to disclose these harms to the public or to Congress, and refused to implement safety fixes that could have protected young users.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><div><p data-testid="paragraph-content">“Meta has designed social media products and platforms that it is aware are addictive to kids, and they’re aware that those addictions lead to a whole host of serious mental health issues,” says Previn Warren, the co-lead attorney for the plaintiffs in the case. “Like tobacco, this is a situation where there are dangerous products that were marketed to kids,” Warren adds. “They did it anyway, because more usage meant more profits for the company.”&nbsp;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">The following allegations against Meta come from the brief filed in an unprecedented multidistrict litigation. More than 1,800 plaintiffs—including children and parents, school districts, and state attorneys general—have joined together in a suit alleging that the parent companies behind Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, and YouTube “relentlessly pursued a strategy of growth at all costs, recklessly ignoring the impact of their products on children’s mental and physical health,” according to their master complaint. The newly unsealed allegations about Meta are just one small part of the sprawling suit. (TIME filed a motion to intervene in the case to ensure public access to court records; the motion was denied.)</p></div><div><p data-testid="paragraph-content">The plaintiffs’ brief, first reported by TIME, purports to be based on sworn depositions of current and former Meta executives, internal communications, and company research and presentations obtained during the lawsuit’s discovery process. It includes quotes and excerpts from thousands of pages of testimony and internal company documents. TIME was not able to independently view the underlying testimony or research quoted in the brief, since those documents remain under seal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content"><strong>Read More:</strong> <em><a href="https://time.com/7334078/matthew-bergman-social-media-victims-lawsuits/">The Lawyer Suing Social Media Companies On Behalf of Kids</a></em></p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">But the brief still paints a damning picture of the company’s internal research and deliberations about issues that have long plagued its platforms. Plaintiffs claim that since 2017, Meta has aggressively pursued young users, even as its internal research suggested its social media products could be addictive and dangerous to kids. Meta employees proposed multiple ways to mitigate these harms, according to the brief, but were repeatedly blocked by executives who feared that new safety features would hamper teen engagement or user growth.</p></div><div><p data-testid="paragraph-content">“We strongly disagree with these allegations, which rely on cherry-picked quotes and misinformed opinions in an attempt to present a deliberately misleading picture," a Meta spokesperson said in a statement to TIME. "The full record will show that for over a decade, we have listened to parents, researched issues that matter most, and made real changes to protect teens – like introducing Teen Accounts with built-in protections and providing parents with controls to manage their teens’ experiences. We’re proud of the progress we’ve made and we stand by our record.”</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">In the years since the lawsuit was filed, Meta has implemented new safety features designed to address some of the problems described by plaintiffs. In 2024, Meta unveiled Instagram Teen Accounts, which defaults any user between 13 and 18 into an account that is automatically private, limits sensitive content, turns off notifications at night, and doesn’t allow messaging from unconnected adults. “We know parents are worried about their teens having unsafe or inappropriate experiences online, and that’s why we’ve significantly reimagined the Instagram experience for tens of millions of teens with new Teen Accounts,” a Meta spokeswoman told TIME in June. “These accounts provide teens with built-in protections to automatically limit who’s contacting them and the content they’re seeing, and teens under 16 need a parent’s permission to change those settings. We also give parents oversight over their teens’ use of Instagram, with ways to see who their teens are chatting with and block them from using the app for more than 15 minutes a day, or for certain periods of time, like during school or at night.”</p></div><div><p data-testid="paragraph-content">And yet the plaintiffs’ brief suggests that Meta resisted safety changes like these for years.&nbsp;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">The brief quotes testimony from Brian Boland, Meta’s former vice president of partnerships who worked at the company for 11 years and resigned in 2020. “My feeling then and my feeling now is that they don’t meaningfully care about user safety,” he allegedly said. “It’s not something that they spend a lot of time on. It’s not something they think about. And I really think they don’t care.”</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">After the plaintiffs’ brief was unsealed late Friday night, Meta did not immediately respond to TIME’s requests for comment.&nbsp;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">Here are some of the most notable allegations from the plaintiffs’ omnibus brief:&nbsp;</p><h2>Allegation: Meta had a high threshold for "sex trafficking" content—and no way to report child sexual content</h2><p data-testid="paragraph-content">Despite Instagram’s “zero tolerance” policy for child sexual abuse material, the platform did not offer users a simple way to report child sexual abuse content, according to the brief. Plaintiffs allege that Jayakumar raised the issue multiple times when she joined Meta in 2020, but was told it would be too difficult to address. Yet Instagram allowed users to easily report far less serious violations, like “spam,” “intellectual property violation” and “promotion of firearms,” according to plaintiffs.</p></div><div><p data-testid="paragraph-content">Jayakumar was even more shocked to learn that Instagram had a disturbingly high tolerance for sex trafficking on the platform. According to the brief, she testified that Meta had a “17x” strike policy for accounts that reportedly engaged in the “trafficking of humans for sex,” meaning it would take at least 16 reports for an account to be deleted.   </p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">“Meta never told parents, the public, or the Districts that it doesn’t delete accounts that have engaged over fifteen times in sex trafficking,” the plaintiffs wrote. </p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">A Meta spokesperson disputed this allegation to TIME, saying the company has for years removed accounts immediately if it suspects them of human trafficking or exploitation and has made it easier over time for users to report content that violates child-exploitation policies. </p><h2>Allegation: Meta "lied to Congress" about its knowledge of harms on the platform</h2><p data-testid="paragraph-content">For years, plaintiffs allege, Meta’s internal research had found that teenagers who frequently use Instagram and Facebook have higher rates of anxiety and depression.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p data-testid="paragraph-content">In late 2019, according to the brief, Meta designed a “deactivation study,” which found that users who stopped using Facebook and Instagram for a week showed lower rates of anxiety, depression, and loneliness. Meta halted the study and did not publicly disclose the results, stating that the research study was biased by the “existing media narratives around the company.” (A Meta spokesperson told TIME that the study was initially conceived as a pair of one-weeks pilots, and researchers declined to continue it because it found that the only reductions in feelings of depression, anxiety, and loneliness were among people who already believed Facebook was bad for them.)</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">At least one Meta employee was uncomfortable with the implications of this decision: “If the results are bad and we don’t publish and they leak,” this employee wrote, according to the brief, “is it going to look like tobacco companies doing research and knowing cigs were bad and then keeping that info to themselves?”</p></div><div><p data-testid="paragraph-content">Indeed, in December 2020, when the Senate Judiciary Committee asked the company in a set of written questions whether it was “able to determine whether increased use of its platform among teenage girls has any correlation with increased signs of depression” and “increased signs of anxiety,” the company offered only a one-word answer: “No.”</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">To the plaintiffs in the case, the implication is clear: “The company never publicly disclosed the results of its deactivation study. Instead, Meta lied to Congress about what it knew.”</p><h2>Allegation: The company knew Instagram was letting adult strangers connect with teenagers</h2><p data-testid="paragraph-content">For years <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/10/instagram-has-massive-harassment-problem/572890/">Instagram has had </a>a well-documented problem of adults harassing teens. Around 2019, company researchers recommended making all teen accounts private by default in order to prevent adult strangers from connecting with kids, according to the plaintiffs’ brief. Instead of implementing this recommendation, Meta asked its growth team to study the potential impact of making all teen accounts private. The growth team was pessimistic, according to the brief, and responded that the change would likely reduce engagement.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p data-testid="paragraph-content">By 2020, the growth team had determined that a private-by-default setting would result in a loss of 1.5 million monthly active teens a year on Instagram. The plaintiffs’ brief quotes an unnamed employee as saying: “taking away unwanted interactions… is likely to lead to a potentially untenable problem with engagement and growth.” Over the next several months, plaintiffs allege, Meta’s policy, legal, communications, privacy, and well-being teams all recommended making teen accounts private by default, arguing that the switch “will increase teen safety” and was in line with expectations from users, parents, and regulators. But Meta did not launch the feature that year.&nbsp;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">Safety researchers were dismayed, according to excerpts of an internal conversation quoted in the filing. One allegedly grumbled: “Isn’t safety the whole point of this team?”&nbsp;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">“Meta knew that placing teens into a default-private setting would have eliminated 5.4 million unwanted interactions a day,” the plaintiffs wrote. Still, Meta didn’t make the fix. Instead, inappropriate interactions between adults and kids on Instagram skyrocketed to 38 times that on Facebook Messenger, according to the brief. The launch of Instagram Reels allegedly compounded the problem. It allowed young teenagers to broadcast short videos to a wide audience, including adult strangers.</p></div><div><p data-testid="paragraph-content"><strong>Read More:</strong> <em><a href="https://time.com/7327229/raul-torrez-new-mexico-meta-lawsuit/">The AG Putting Big Tech On Trial</a></em>.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">An internal 2022 audit allegedly found that Instagram’s Accounts You May Follow feature recommended 1.4 million potentially inappropriate adults to teenage users in a single day. By 2023, according to the plaintiffs, Meta knew that they were recommending minors to potentially suspicious adults and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">It wasn’t until 2024 that Meta rolled out default privacy settings to all teen accounts. In the four years it took the company to implement their own safety recommendations, teens experienced billions of unwanted interactions with strangers online. Inappropriate encounters between teens and adults were common enough, according to the brief, that the company had an acronym for them: “IIC,” or “inappropriate interactions with children.”&nbsp;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">A Meta spokesperson said the company has defaulted teens under 16 to private accounts since 2021, began defaulting teens under 18 into private accounts with the introduction of its Teen Accounts program, and has <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/12/combating-online-predators/">taken steps</a> to protect users from online predators. </p></div><div><h2>Allegation: Meta aggressively targeted young users</h2><p data-testid="paragraph-content">Meta feared young users would abandon Facebook and Instagram for their competitors. Acquiring and keeping young users became a central business goal. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg suggested that “teen time spent be our top goal of 2017,” according to a company executive quoted in the brief. That has remained the case, plaintiffs allege; internal company documents from 2024 stated that “acquiring new teen users is mission critical to the success of Instagram.” (A Meta spokesperson said time spent on its platforms is not currently a company goal.)</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">Meta launched a campaign to connect with school districts and paid organizations like the National Parent Teacher Association and Scholastic to conduct outreach to schools and families. Meanwhile, according to the brief, Meta used location data to push notifications to students in “school blasts,” presumably as part of an attempt to increase youth engagement during the school day. As one employee allegedly put it: “One of the things we need to optimize for is sneaking a look at your phone under your desk in the middle of Chemistry :)”.</p></div><div><p data-testid="paragraph-content">Though Meta aggressively pursued young users, it may not have known exactly how old those new users were. Whistleblower <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/6ccd5abd-cbb9-5107-d48d-b99e821eb244/2025-09-09%20-%20QFR%20Responses%20-%20Sattizahn.pdf">Jason Sattizahn recently</a> testified to Congress that Meta does not reliably know the age of its users. (Meta pushed back on Sattizahn’s testimony, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/meta-whistleblower-research-kids-vr-former-employees-stock-rcna230131">saying in a statement to NBC</a> that his claims were “nonsense” and “based on selectively leaked internal documents that were picked specifically to craft a false narrative.”) In 2022, according to the plaintiffs’ brief, there were 216 million users on Meta platforms whose age was “unknown.”</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">Federal law requires social media platforms to observe various data-privacy safeguards for users under 13, and Meta policy states that users under 13 are not allowed on its platforms. Yet the plaintiffs’ court filing claims Meta knew that children under 13 used the company’s products anyway. Internal research cited in the brief suggested there were 4 million users under 13 on Instagram in 2015; by 2018, the plaintiffs claim, Meta knew that roughly 40% of children aged 9 to 12 said they used Instagram daily.</p></div><div><p data-testid="paragraph-content">The plaintiffs allege that this was a deliberate business strategy. The brief describes a coordinated effort to acquire young users that included studying the psychology and digital behavior of “tweens” and exploring new products designed for “users as young as 5-10.”&nbsp;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">Internally, some employees expressed disgust at the attempt to target preteens. “Oh good, we’re going after &lt;13 year olds now?” one wrote, according to the brief. “Zuck has been talking about that for a while...targeting 11 year olds feels like tobacco companies a couple decades ago (and today). Like we’re seriously saying ‘we have to hook them young’ here.”</p><h2>Allegation: Meta's executives initially shelved efforts to make Instagram less toxic for teens</h2><p data-testid="paragraph-content">To combat toxic “social comparison,” in 2019 Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri announced a new product feature that would “hide” likes on posts. Meta researchers had determined that hiding likes would make users “significantly less likely to feel worse about themselves,” according to the plaintiffs’ brief. The initiative was code-named Project Daisy.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p data-testid="paragraph-content">But after a series of tests, Meta backtracked on Project Daisy. It determined the feature was “pretty negative to FB metrics,” including ad revenue, according to the plaintiffs’ brief, which quotes an unnamed employee on the growth team insisting: “It’s a social comparison app, fucking get used to it.”&nbsp;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">A similar debate took place over the app’s beauty filters. Plaintiffs claim that an internal review concluded beauty filters exacerbated the “risk and maintenance of several mental health concerns, including body dissatisfaction, eating disorders, and body dysmorphic disorder,” and that Meta knew that “children are particularly vulnerable.” Meta banned beauty filters in 2019, only to roll them back out the following year after the company realized that banning beauty filters would have a “negative growth impact,” according to the plaintiffs’ brief.&nbsp;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">Other company researchers allegedly built an AI “classifier” to identify content that would lead to negative appearance comparison, so that Meta could avoid recommending it to vulnerable kids. But Mosseri allegedly killed the project, disappointing developers who “felt like they had a solution” to “a big problem.”</p></div><div><h2>Allegation: Meta doesn't automatically remove harmful content, including self-harm content</h2><p data-testid="paragraph-content">While Meta developed AI tools to monitor the platforms for harmful content, the company didn’t automatically delete that content even when it determined with “100% confidence” that it violated Meta’s policies against child sexual-abuse material or eating-disorder content. Meta’s AI classifiers did not automatically delete posts that glorified self-harm unless they were 94% certain they violated platform policy, according to the plaintiffs’ brief. As a result, most of that content remained on the platform, where teenage users often discovered it. In a 2021 internal company survey cited by plaintiffs, more than 8% of respondents aged 13 to 15 reported having seen someone harm themselves, or threaten to do so, on Instagram during the past week.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content"><strong>Read More: </strong><em><a href="https://time.com/7310444/instagram-lawsuit-self-harm/">‘Everything I Learned About Suicide, I Learned On Instagram.’</a></em></p></div><div><p data-testid="paragraph-content">A Meta spokesperson said the company reports more child sexual-abuse material than any other service and uses an array of tools to proactively find that content, including photo and video-matching technologies as well as machine learning. The spokesperson said human reviewers assess content flagged before it is deleted to ensure it violates policies, prevent mistakes that could affect users, and maintain the integrity of the company's detection databases. </p><h2>Allegation: Meta knew its products were addictive, but publicly downplayed the harms</h2><p data-testid="paragraph-content">The addictive nature of the company’s products wasn’t a secret internally. “Oh my gosh yall IG is a drug,” one of the company’s user-experience researchers allegedly wrote to a colleague. “We’re basically pushers.”&nbsp;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">Meta does not officially study addiction to its products, plaintiffs allege; it studies “problematic use.” In 2018, company researchers surveyed 20,000 Facebook users in the U.S. and found that 58% had some level of “problematic use”—55% mild, and 3.1% severe. But when Meta published an account of this research the following year, only the smaller number of users with “severe” problematic use was mentioned. “We estimate (as an upper bound) that 3.1% of Facebook users in the U.S. experience problematic use,” <a href="https://scontent-sjc6-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/240848801_924166131530538_1308218914254273445_n.pdf?_nc_cat=111&amp;ccb=1-7&amp;_nc_sid=e280be&amp;_nc_ohc=C_tgb_3384YQ7kNvwHuZaN0&amp;_nc_oc=Adm09HFJ1ktJoo9WIE0m4qDw6-OlF_2k7EQF8rnKbmwRLRsOB1cDAsP3XLwyT8q2accez_oKoOZRXzLKpBMUCsHU&amp;_nc_zt=14&amp;_nc_ht=scontent-sjc6-1.xx&amp;_nc_gid=WZWa2peYFXQxwOygthrZ6g&amp;oh=00_AfhNhtKp-IiYwptqBR42Y2exRT2A9v9zp5xlCdNIzxAJ_A&amp;oe=6925C501">wrote the researchers</a>. The other 55% of users are not mentioned anywhere in the public report.&nbsp;</p></div><p data-testid="paragraph-content">Plaintiffs allege that Meta’s safety team proposed features designed to lessen addiction, only to see them set aside or watered down. One employee who helped develop a “quiet mode” feature said it was shelved because Meta was concerned that this feature would negatively impact metrics related to growth and usage.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">Around the same time, another user-experience researcher at Instagram allegedly recommended that Meta inform the public about its research findings: “Because our product exploits weaknesses in the human psychology to promote product engagement and time spent,” the researcher wrote, Meta needed to “alert people to the effect that the product has on their brain.”&nbsp;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content">Meta did not.&nbsp;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-content"><em>This story has been updated to reflect additional comments from Meta. </em></p></article></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>Google, the Silicon Valley company <em>par excellence</em>, proclaimed to “organise the world’s information” and adopted “don’t be evil” as its corporate motto. And what could possibly be wrong with such aspirations? Indeed, most company leaders and high-tech workers, in the Valley, genuinely believe they are “making the world a better place” while also making money.</p>
<p>Silicon Valley is the progressive face of capitalism. We’ve experienced it, intimately. Billions of people, across the globe, enjoy real benefits from searching the world’s information, connecting with people across time and space, and carrying a supercomputers in their pockets. Silicon Valley doesn’t obviously throw workers into factories and mines for endless hours on low pay; such images are hidden, rendered distant by the supply chain . Instead, the Valley, in our imaginations, is populated by knowledge workers, a diverse and smart workforce that designs, solves, and codes in humane office spaces, with above average wages, ping pong, cafeterias, flexible working hours, sleeping cubicles. What’s not to like?</p>
<p>We could consider the Valley’s hidden workers, those who clean, wait tables, wash cars, nanny, deliver packages, tend gardens, fix infrastructure for poverty wages; we could explore the trailer parks down the road from Google HQ, or document the shootings in the streets, the homeless that push shopping trolleys up and down the El Camino, their world a bundle of rags; or the gun shops that sell semi-automatics, the out-of-control, over-staffed police, armed with military-grade cast-me-downs, that regularly gun down the poor; the families crowded into small apartments, the father who spends his days scouring trash bins for recyclable bottles to trade for cash, the human trafficking of women, the prostitution, coerced to serve a predominately male workforce; or the disciplining and harassment of the undocumented, the deportations, the splitting up and destruction of families; or the local charities that collect food for kids, during seasonal holidays, since outside of school time their families cannot provide; or the extraordinarily high incarceration rates that control the surplus labour force, the armed guards on campuses and in schools, office complexes and shop interiors; or the poverty, the child who cannot concentrate in class since their teeth are rotting in their mouth, the extreme and devastating inequalities in wealth and income, the untreated illnesses and injuries, for lack of medical access, the widespread use of antidepressants, the addictions, the dispossessed, the broken dreams and the crying … </p>
<p>Yet these symptoms of a broken and decaying society are studiously ignored, repressed, unmentioned by Silicon Valley’s middle and upper classes. Psychological repression is widespread amongst the highly paid of the Valley. It’s a defence: it’s just too damn painful to contemplate the full horror of social reality. And life can be organised to avoid it, or deny it. So many don’t even notice.</p>
<p>I could mention all the evil business models, where vast computing power and fancy algorithms trawl our digital footprints to track and surveil, to sell and manipulate, to intensify our addictions; and we might reflect on the Valley’s enormous and continuing contributions to building military  machines that rain down death and destruction. </p>
<p>Instead, here, in this article, I want to point to the root problem, <em>the ultimate source of evil</em>, and explain why Silicon Valley is hypocrisy on a grand scale. The Valley’s movers and shakers believe they are progressive, that entrepreneurial capitalism is the road to utopia. But it’s not. In fact, the opposite is the case: the Valley is a cause of this horror, of the social ills, and the social breakdown that it must repress: it is both responsible and culpable for creating a dystopia.</p>
<p>I want all the talented, hopeful, optimistic high-tech workers, who genuinely want to make the world a better place, who are about to found a new and exciting startup, to just take a short pause, to stop, look around, think, reflect and reconsider: <em>the kind of firm you incorporate, the institutional rules you adopt, is precisely the choice point between doing evil and doing good</em>.</p>
<p>I will try to explain. My apologies if it takes a little while, since if the following facts were readily understood and generally accepted, then Silicon Valley would already be good, not evil, and I wouldn’t need to explain.</p>
<h2 id="silicon-valley-midwife-of-the-capitalist-firm">Silicon Valley: midwife of the capitalist firm</h2>
<p>The Valley is all about startups. They spring up all the time. New exciting and hopeful adventures. It’s like forming a band, but better.</p>
<p>In huge, mature corporations the social relations of production are obscured by layers of hierarchy and absentee ownership. But in a startup the power relations are direct and visible, and often share an office with you. You can observe the basic unit of production in capitalism—the capitalist firm—as if under a microscope.</p>
<p>Let’s lay out the property relations of a (slightly simplified) typical startup. </p>
<p>The startup has owner(s), usually “high net worth” individuals, either directly present or indirectly in the form of venture capital firms. Venture capital provides the initial funds for the new venture. The actual founders, the ones with the ideas and talent, but no money, also part own the firm. The divvying up of the initial share issue between founders and early investors is a detail. The founders, armed with a new injection of capital, then recruit workers by convincing them of “the vision”. These are the first employees. And off we go. </p>
<p>The owner(s) of the startup are in complete control, and their decisions are final. Owners can promote, demote, hire and fire anyone, at any time. Owners set wage levels, which are kept secret (and the workers, being earnest and highly disciplined, avoid this subject with each other—that would break a taboo). Startups are definitely not run on democratic lines: workers don’t get to appoint managers, set strategy, or distribute profits. Instead, the startup is a mini dictatorship: sure, there’s plenty of technical debate, and back-and-forth, and head scratching, but ultimately it’s a dictatorship.</p>
<p>The owners pays all input costs—such as office rental, computers, electricity and heating, labour etc. They own all outputs, such as new software or hardware, and any inventions (which, in the Valley, are aggressively patented). The owners are liable for any profits and losses of the company. The startup’s bank accounts are hidden from the workers, and out of their control.</p>
<p>This basic social relation—between profit-taking capitalist owners and wage-earning workers—is constitutive of capitalism. For example, today you can travel to Shropshire, England, and visit Ironbridge village, one of the birthplaces of the industrial revolution and “the silicon valley of the 1800s”. You can tour an early ironworks and see the great furnaces where workers toiled, the tiny administrative office (to dole out wages, and keep accounts), and nearby, on a large hill overlooking the site, the capitalists’ large and imposing mansions.</p>
<p>The form may have changed, but not the content. In this sense, Silicon Valley is deeply conservative. It proclaims to disrupt everything, and make all fresh, new and shiny—except this basic social relationship.</p>
<p>Almost all Silicon Valley workers accept these social relations as entirely natural, acceptable, and pretty much fair and equitable. The owners fund the company. They therefore “own the firm”. The owners risk a lot of capital, and the workers receive a good wage, based on supply and demand in the marketplace, plus some ramp-up time to try and invent new stuff, which is fun. What’s not to like? What’s the problem?</p>
<h2 id="silicon-valley-its-theft-all-the-way-down">Silicon Valley: it’s theft all the way down</h2>
<p>Startups reproduce, in embryo form, the wage system, where the capitalist owner hires-in labour at a pre-agreed rental price. In a capitalist firm, labour is just an another <em>ex ante</em> cost of production. The workers mix their labour with inputs and produce an output for sale. Normally, firms sell at prices that exceed their costs of production, which includes the cost of used-up inputs, rent, interest on capital loans, and wage costs etc. Any residual income then gets distributed as profit to the owner, or owners, of the firm.</p>
<p>Imagine that you and I agree to exchange something in the marketplace, say a second-hand iPhone on Ebay. You get the money, I get an iPhone. You may get a good deal, or I may get a good deal, depending on our “higgling and haggling” in the marketplace. Whether a fair price is struck, or not, there’s an exchange of something for something: some goods for some money. This social transaction satisfies a “principle of exchange”. We’ve swapped stuff, and no-one forced us to.</p>
<p>But let’s say I just took the iPhone from you. And you received no money at all. This violates the principle of exchange. I got something for nothing: some goods, some resources, for free. That’s theft. Obviously so.</p>
<p><em>All startups in Silicon Valley violate the principle of exchange and institute a system of theft</em>. They are theft-based institutions. If the startup is successful and grows, so does the theft, since theft is baked into the institutional structure of the firm, right from the get go. If the startup goes global, like an Apple, Facebook, or Google, then the cancer spreads and the theft takes place on a global scale.</p>
<p>But the theft is hidden. We need some reflection to really see it.</p>
<p>The workers in a startup are the actual cause of any profits it makes. We can demonstrate this with a simple thought experiment: imagine the workers stopped working. Would the firm have any possibility of making a profit, or if already profitable, continue to make that profit? But we don’t need to imagine. This is called a strike. And owners hate it, since it kills their profit.</p>
<p>So, in any company, including a startup, the workers create the value. </p>
<p>What, then, do the owners contribute or create?</p>
<p>The owners, or venture capitalists, contribute capital. They advance money to fund the startup until it (hopefully) starts making money. And then they expect a return. Since they’ve given something they should definitely get something back, otherwise we violate the principle of exchange. In fact, they should expect repayment of the sums advanced and—let’s be generous here—also a risk premium (since most startups fail without making profit) and, also—in order to be really straight and fair about this—some collateral as security (such as first dibs on any outstanding assets if the venture fails). This seems like a fair exchange.</p>
<p>It is. So far so good. </p>
<p>But if early investors merely did this—that is, simply advance some <em>loan capital</em>—they would not become the owners of the firm. Once the startup made money, the loan would be repaid (by the firm), and the early investors would have no further claims on the fruits of others’ labour (that is the value created by the workers).</p>
<p>The important point is this: loan capital does not violate the principle of exchange.</p>
<p>But Silicon Valley startups are not funded by loan capital. Venture capitalists want, and get, much more than this. They advance capital to a firm, but in addition to being repaid, they demand ownership of the firm, i.e. <em>equity capital</em>, and receive stock (shares in the firm). And so they “own the firm”. In consequence, once their initial loan and risk premium is repaid, they get even more: they retain a claim on the firm’s future income, that is the fruits of others’ labour <em>in perpetuity</em> (or until the firm dissolves, or they sell their shares etc.)</p>
<p>And the mere legal ownership of a firm is <em>sufficient</em> to lay claim on its profit. And, right here, is precisely the moment when the principle of exchange is violated. Once the firm repays its debt then the early investors are now made whole. Beyond this point, we have workers creating profits, and owners appropriating that profit without needing to contribute an hour of their time, or a dime from their pockets. The owners are getting something for nothing. The owners can, as John Stuart Mill put it: “grow richer, as it were in their sleep”. There’s no exchange. Just appropriation. And that is what’s commonly, and accurately, called economic exploitation.</p>
<p>The important point is this: equity capital violates the principle of exchange. </p>
<p>Sometimes the meaning of a social situation can suddenly flip. You notice something new, like an object in the wrong place, or a small inconsistency that points to a secret, or a lie. This is one of those occasions. There’s an enormous difference between <em>advancing</em> capital to a firm, and <em>owning</em> a firm. This vital distinction is conspicuously absent from all the upbeat, world-changing, and progressive chit-chat in the coffee shops, restaurants, offices and homes of Silicon Valley. So let’s pretend they might be listening, that all their chatter stops, just for a moment, and we whisper into each and every individual ear: <em>equity capital is theft</em>. </p>
<p>When you take profits, but contribute <em>nothing</em> to the output of a firm, other than holding a paper claim, you are stealing.</p>
<p>Yet this is how startups in Silicon Valley are organised. Cohort after cohort of “smart” groups of highly educated workers are quite happy to sign up to their own exploitation, and cede control over how they organise their working day, and what they produce. The most effective prison is the one you don’t realise you’re in.</p>
<p>But hold on. Look, we’ve woken the libertarian consciousness of Silicon Valley, and its rationality is strong and terrible: those that were whispered to have been stirred, and they reply, in unison: No-one forces workers to accept these terms, and the wage contract is voluntary, and therefore perfectly OK! Go away, annoying socialist, and stop spoiling our fun!</p>
<h2 id="silicon-valley-forcing-people-to-sell-their-labour">Silicon Valley: forcing people to sell their labour</h2>
<p>Do workers freely enter into the wage contract? Do founders, with great ideas, have the freedom to start new commercial ventures that aren’t based on theft? To answer, let’s first define non-exploitative social relations of production.</p>
<p>In principle, Silicon Valley startups could be incorporated as profit-sharing worker cooperatives. In this type of institution, all working members share the profit, which is democratically distributed. So if you join the co-op, you get a say, and you get profit shares. If you leave, you don’t anymore. The firm is collectively owned by its current working members.</p>
<p>Worker co-ops don’t hire in labour at a pre-agreed rental price. They do the opposite. They hire-in capital at a pre-agreed rental price (i.e., raise loan capital <em>not</em> equity capital). So capital, not labour, is merely another <em>ex ante</em> cost of production with no claim on the residual income of the firm.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>In a democratic worker co-op, the principle of exchange is not violated, and no-one systematically exploits others and steals the value they (jointly) created. Clearly, this is a more lucrative deal for workers: profit-sharing is better than a wage. So why doesn’t this happen in the Valley? Why don’t lots of workers incorporate worker co-ops? </p>
<p>There are some carrots and a stick.</p>
<h3 id="the-carrot-join-us-join-us">The carrot: join us, join us!</h3>
<p>High-tech workers, especially those with in-demand skills, get more than wages, they get stock options.</p>
<p>A stock option bestows the right to purchase company shares at a (very low) predefined price. You have to work, normally for many years, before you can exercise that right. The aim is worker retention, and align incentives so workers are motivated to create profits “for the company”. Stock options, in a sense, automatically bestow the material benefits of trade unionism without the need to organise. Any worker is, of course, glad of this potential source of additional income.</p>
<p>But stock options, when exercised, are equity capital and confer (part) ownership of the firm: and, as we’ve seen, that fundamentally means participating in theft. Stock options, therefore, invite a section of the working class to join the elevated ranks of the capitalist class, and start exploiting others’ labour. (In practice, most stock options turn out worthless, since most new ventures fail. But it’s the hope that motivates).</p>
<p>In a small startup, as is common in Silicon Valley, it’s especially clear that the workers create all the added value. But the owner(s) appropriate it. So even the best educated minds start to notice. And this doesn’t seem entirely fair. So stock options function to muddy the waters, and paper over the inconvenient truth of exploitation.</p>
<p>So that’s one carrot, which pushes high-tech workers to sign-up to a capitalist firm. But there are more. If a group of workers decide to incorporate a new venture then, unless they are highly politically conscious and especially moral creatures, they will incorporate a capitalist firm, not a worker co-op. Why? Because you’ll definitely make more money by owning a firm, paying others wages, and keeping the profit to yourself.</p>
<p>Many startup founders in Silicon Valley know they’re ripping off the workers they employ. They might soothe their guilt by pointing out they offer stock options, or throw themselves into libertarianism, which conveniently coincides with their material interests. But it’s a fact that stock is normally heavily concentrated amongst a few early founders and venture capitalists. As time goes on, the founders contributions are eclipsed by the hired workers, and then it’s just exploitation all down the line. The company is bought-out, the founders get their initial advances and more, and therefore cash in, and make their millions. But, in almost all cases, they did not contribute to the creation of that value—they stole it from the workers they hired.</p>
<p>So the wage contract is sweetened by stock options. That works. But the contract is only voluntary if the workers have other options, if they have a choice. Do they?</p>
<h3 id="the-stick-reproduce-capitalism-or-wither-and-die">The stick: reproduce capitalism or wither and die</h3>
<p>But there are sticks too, which remove all choice, and prevent founders from incorporating worker co-operatives, even if they were sufficiently politically conscious to want to. </p>
<p>Silicon Valley is famous for its vibrant and extensive venture capital community. Plenty of capital swills around, continually searching, like Sauron’s great eye, for the latest hit company to fund, and therefore own and exploit the efforts and creativity of hundreds and thousands of workers.</p>
<p>Any venture capitalist, quite naturally, wants to maximise their returns. So, if faced with a choice between funding two companies, A and B, where A is a capitalist firm, and therefore offers equity in return for capital, whereas B is a worker co-op, and only offers interest repayments in return for capital, then the venture capitalist will always opt to fund A. No contest. Equity capital is strictly a better deal than loan capital. (And it’s not just more money, but also top-down dictatorial control of the company’s direction, and the working conditions and wage levels of employees. And being powerful is much more fun than being powerless. It’s great for the ego.)</p>
<p>Hence worker co-ops don’t get funded in Silicon Valley, and never will. So all those talented and creative workers, with good ideas for making things that people want, have no choice but to incorporate a capitalist firm, and begin sorting people into a class of owners, and a class of workers.</p>
<p>I witnessed an especially ugly example at an Silicon Valley business conference. An “Angel Investor” (someone who provides early seed capital) presented a talk about the criteria they apply when deciding which new ventures to invest in, and therefore what aspiring founders should do in order to maximise their chances of raising capital. A big factor, for the Angel, was that founders also raise money from friends and family, since “the desire to not disappoint loved ones is a great stimulant to hard work”. The Angel gave examples of “great stories” about teams they’d funded and the great returns made “by everybody”. At the close the Angel invited any founders in the audience to come and pitch their ideas to him—right there and then.</p>
<p>A line of about twenty or so young people formed in front of the Angel, desperate to get funding for their cherished ideas. And there it was, like a frozen scene from a perverted nativity: an anointed minority of one, with the monopoly on capital, and an unwashed majority, full of aspirations and creativity, lining up, cap-in-hand, to proffer the sacrifice of equity in their newborn, and surrender themselves to exploitation.</p>
<p>There was no choice, there is no choice: either submit to capital or watch your ideas wither and die. There are no other practical ways to raise significant capital. Real Angels don’t exist: those that ask only for their loan to be repaid, and not ownership of the firm; who reject the social relationship of equity capital, and therefore only invest in new ventures that incorporate as democratic worker-owned co-ops, so that all profit is shared, according to actual merit and contribution. If such fabled beings were present, the line before them would have been much, much longer.</p>
<p>There is no choice. Founders must incorporate capitalist firms, and must rent-in labour. And workers, who need income, don’t have the option to join a worker co-op. They must sign the wage contract. This isn’t voluntary, it’s coerced—by those with the monopoly on capital.</p>
<p>Silicon Valley culture celebrates venture capital, the Schumpeterian heroic entrepreneur, the dynamism of capitalism, and the gee-whiz technical and creative ideas of startup founders. But Silicon Valley repeatedly and continually reproduces exploitation, where some members of the firm own it, and others simply rent their labour to it. There’s zero innovation or disruption in this sphere. The Valley is a great engine, churning out new companies, day after day, which reproduce the division between an economic class that wins, and an economic class that loses.</p>

<p>Economic inequality has always been around. But notably, in the last 30 years or so, economic inequality, in the rich countries, has significantly increased. So we find people at the bottom struggling for food and shelter, while those at the top earn many years worth of the average salary while they sleep. The majority in the middle work hard yet lack savings, living their entire lives a few paychecks from destitution.</p>
<p>Things have got so bad that even mainstream discourse has shifted to reflect the new reality. We’re routinely told that millennials face low wages, poor quality jobs, high debt, and worse economic outcomes compared to their parents. People now accept that the political system is rigged by a rich elite who’ve captured the institutions of the nation state. And even the arch conservative world of academic economics talks about inequality. And that simply didn’t happen as recently as ten years ago.</p>
<p>Bourgeois thinkers struggle to explain the major cause of economic inequality, because to do requires thinking deeply about property relations and the issue of systematic exploitation. Instead, they prefer to think about unequal human capital endowments, taxation policies, interest and growth rates, the saving habits of workers, rising costs in child and health care, or the impact of automation. They’ll think about anything and everything except the actual reason for inequality.</p>
<p>Capitalist firms, in an important sense, are social machines, institutions that operate within the context of a market economy to “sort” individuals into different classes by means of the wage system. This sorting produces a very specific income and wealth distribution, which is peculiar to capitalism. Empirically, capitalist societies exhibit two distinct regimes: a lognormal distribution of wage income, and a Pareto distribution of profit income.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>In any dynamic society, with a continual reallocation of the division of labour as new skills are demanded and other skills are automated or changed, we should expect some level of wage inequality due to mismatches between supply and demand in the labour market. Also, some jobs are terrible and dangerous, and people should get more for risking more. And some people really do contribute more within the workplace, and its OK if they get additional awards from their peers, if only to make sure they stick around. And some people actually need more, perhaps due to illness or disabilities or additional domestic responsibilities. All this is fine.</p>
<p>But, empirically, we see more than wage inequality. We see two distinct regimes. We see a majority earning wages, at the bottom of the scale, and a minority taking profits, at the top of the scale. Capitalist societies produce extreme inequalities where the top 10% or so take a big and disproportionate slice of the social pie.</p>
<p>And the reason is obvious, for those willing to look: the major cause of economic inequality is the wage system itself. The more workers a capitalist exploits the more profit they make. The more profit they make the more workers they can exploit. And capitalists in the super-rich bracket enjoy positive feedback effects. They can hardly lose. The economic game is entirely rigged in their favour. And, in this elevated state, they fall asleep, wake up the next morning, having earned more than workers do in their entire lifetimes.</p>
<p>In fact, the inequality between capitalists far exceeds the inequality between workers. The super-rich become astronomically rich as we bounce along the power-law tail of the Pareto distribution. The astronomically rich capture ostensibly democratic institutions, a phenomenon that is particularly clear in the USA, so that even mild social reforms are off the table. We’ve seen a collection of post-war policies, that once mitigated economic inequality, ditched in the last thirty years or so. This is why things have got even worse. Economic exploitation has increased.</p>
<p>Extreme economic inequality causes untold misery. At the top we see excessive and wasteful hyper-consumption. At the bottom, countless everyday struggles to live a dignified life. All the social ills of Silicon Valley, many of which are hidden in plain sight, are suffered mostly by the poorly paid, those with the least money. But inequality affects everyone. Societies with high Gini coefficients do worse on almost all measures of social well-being.</p>
<p>But it doesn’t have to be this way. Let’s imagine an impossible event, just for the sake of illustrating a point. Imagine that all the people we whispered to—in the cafes, the offices and homes of Silicon Valley—actually listened, and decided, right there and then, to abolish exploitation, and resolved, with great determination, to only ever incorporate worker co-ops, and only lend capital, and never demand equity, then—with one decisive and unlikely step—Silicon Valley would actually begin to do good. Because it’s at this precise pivotal moment—the birth of a new productive unit—that a society’s social relations of production either get reproduced, or changed. For once you start to abolish the wage contract, and the renting of human beings, you start to abolish economic classes and extreme income inequality. Wealth would then start to be shared more equitably, and fairly, upon the principle of exchange, according to actual contributions to production, and not specious paper claims. The Pareto upper-regime would lose its material basis, would totter and fall, and therewith all the power that goes with it, the ability to capture and corrupt democracies and run them for the benefit of a privileged and undeserving few. The majority of the population would have more, enjoy more, and live better.</p>
<p>You know, perhaps some really gifted entrepreneurs could figure out a way to export this culture, and good social outcomes, to the rest of the world. </p>
<h2 id="silicon-valley-bullshit-progressivism">Silicon Valley: bullshit progressivism</h2>
<p>But sadly, as of today, that is a dream. And it’s not even a dream that’s widely shared. Silicon Valley does not see the connection between the kinds of firms it funds and creates, and the kinds of social ills that surround it.</p>
<p>But why single out Silicon Valley? What I’ve just described applies to capitalism in general.<br>
Silicon Valley deserves especial opprobrium because the contradiction between its self-image and its reality is particularly stark. Silicon Valley desperately, desperately wants to view itself, and be seen as, socially progressive, enlightened, cutting-edge and, yes, utopian.</p>
<p>But despite the explosion of ideas and firms, and the progressive rhetoric, the core propositions of capitalism are completely untouched, inviolate. The coupling of radical technical experimentation, with extreme conservation of capitalist property relations, has been a very successful recipe for the Valley’s elite.</p>
<p>But the very startups that want to “change the world for the better” immediately reproduce economic exploitation: they separate human beings into a class that must rent their labour, and a class that appropriates the fruits of that labour; a class that is disciplined and must do as they are told in the workplace, and a class that disciplines and commands without democratic control. Every time an optimistic and earnest group of workers, with some great ideas, incorporate a startup and issue equity, any progressive content of those ideas are irreparably harmed.</p>
<p>Yet this is the specific evil that Silicon Valley does: it funnels the progressive content of technical utopianism (the increase in the forces of production) into institutions that exploit workers on a global scale, and contribute to extreme economic inequality (the existing social relations of production). Silicon Valley helps produce the dystopia we live in. It doesn’t change the world for the better. It makes it worse, every single day.</p>
<p>The narcissistic self-image of Valley culture contributes to its political backwardness. Some workers celebrate a victory when corporate HR departments commit to diversity in the workplace, or promise to address the gender pay gap. But these are easy concessions for capitalism, softballs, and the owners of your firm will happily accommodate you. Just don’t ask for bottom-up democracy in the workplace, or profit-sharing. Try it. You’ll get a very different response.</p>
<p>But that’s what I do wish for. And I’m talking to you now, fellow workers of the Valley! If you really want to do no evil, to be good, disrupt the status quo and make the world a better place, then <em>don’t create a capitalist firm</em>: it’s a top-down dictatorship, where the dictators steal the money. There’s nothing progressive about this kind of social institution. Founding such a startup is deeply unethical, represents institutionalised theft, and is a prime cause of diverse social ills. </p>
<p>Instead, use your talents to create democratic worker-owned cooperatives, based on equality among its working members; or help think of creative ways to solve the political problem of capitalists’ monopoly on capital.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> Abolishing economic exploitation genuinely makes the world a better place. Reproducing it in your startup does not.</p>

<p>Or, at the very least, they can.</p>



<p>Recently I got a friend to finally join me on Signal. He asked something about whether or not Signal is truly secure and private, like if it was safe from US government surveillance. I told him: <em>“Well, it’s end-to-end encrypted, so they don’t know <strong>what</strong> we’re talking about, but they definitely know that we’re talking to each other.”</em></p>



<p>I said that because Signal uses our phone numbers as ID’s. So, Signal would know that Phone Number A is talking to Phone Number B, and if they can figure out that Phone Number A belongs to me, and Phone Number B belongs to my buddy (usually not too hard to figure out with some OSINT or the assistance of certain governments), then Signal would know that my buddy and I are talking, even if they don’t know what we’re talking about.</p>



<p>This is a limit of end-to-end encryption, which I’ve <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://sanesecurityguy.com/articles/the-limits-of-end-to-end-encryption/" target="_blank">talked about before</a>. End-to-end encryption provides confidentiality of data, but not anonymity or protection from identifying metadata.</p>



<p>However, I was surprised when my friend got back to me saying that, no, Signal actually doesn’t know who’s talking to who because of this feature called “<a href="https://signal.org/blog/sealed-sender/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sealed Sender</a>“.</p>



<p><em>“Woah! Seriously?! Cool!”</em> I thought. But then I started reading how Sealed Sender actually works, according to none other than Signal themselves, and I found that this feature is very technically complex, and <strong>totally useless</strong>.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>ʕ ಠ ᴥಠ ʔ: Woah! Seriously?! Not cool!</p>
</blockquote>



<h2>One-way anonymity for two-way communications</h2>



<p>While Sealed Sender is pretty complicated under the hood, the result of it is one-way anonymity. That means that, when Phone Number A sends a message to Phone Number B, Signal won’t know that the message is coming from Phone Number A and will only know that the message is to be delivered to Phone Number B.</p>



<p>It does this in a way that’s very similar to snail mail without a return address: the letter inside the mail envelope might tell the recipient who the sender is, but the mail envelope itself tells the post office only who the recipient is so that it can be delivered to them. If the post office doesn’t or can’t open the envelope to read the letter itself, then they don’t know who the sender is. Later on, when the recipient wants to send a reply to the sender, they can do the same thing.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>ʕ·ᴥ·ʔ: Hm, okay. This kind of sounds like it’s anonymous.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Well, yes, it sort of is, but only when there’s only one message to be sent. The problem comes up when multiple messages are being sent back-and-forth like this.</p>



<p>Sticking with the snail mail analogy, what happens when two pen pals keep sending mail to each other from their homes without including return addresses in their envelopes? The postal service might not know who exactly is sending each piece of mail but, over time, they would know that <strong>Address A in Lower Manhattan</strong>, New York, keeps on getting one-way mail from the post office in 3630 East Tremont Avenue, <strong>the Bronx</strong>, New York; and <strong>Address B in the Bronx</strong> keeps on getting one-way mail from the post office in 350 Canal Street, <strong>Lower Manhattan</strong>.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>ʕ´•ᴥ•`ʔ: Oh. Then the postal service would be pretty sure that whoever is living at Address A and Address B are talking to each other.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Exactly. That’s the limitation of one-way anonymity: <strong>it works only one way!</strong> Once you start doing two-way communications, with replies going back-and-forth, then one-way anonymity is useless.</p>



<h2>Two pieces of metadata</h2>



<p>With multiple messages being sent back-and-forth over time, and with Signal knowing <em>only the recipient phone number</em> of each message, it would be pretty hard for Signal to figure out who’s talking to who when their servers are getting thousands of messages every second from different senders, with each message being conveyed to thousands of different recipients. But, Signal doesn’t know <em>only the recipient phone number</em> of each message; they also know the IP address of each sender. And this is where the snail mail analogy fails, because IP addresses are <em>much more specific</em> than post offices.</p>



<p>Signal messages, as we all know, get sent over the internet, and the internet sends data around using IP addresses. Sealed Sender only protects the sender’s phone number; it does not protect the sender’s IP address. So, if you’re sending Signal messages to your super secret pen pal from your house, and you aren’t using a VPN or Tor, then Signal knows that the messages being sent to your pen pal’s phone number are coming from your house’s IP address (not a post office, your house).</p>



<p>Even if you are using some method of masking your real IP address, you still have to use <em>some</em> IP address in order to communicate on the internet, and Signal will see that <em>the same IP address keeps on sending messages to the same phone number</em>. That’s enough to easily figure out that all of these different messages meant for the recipient are coming from the same sender. Sure, maybe you’re using the IP address of a VPN server or Tor exit node that has other Signal users sending messages at the same time, but that’s extremely unlikely. More likely: Even when you use a VPN or Tor, Signal can easily tell that every Sealed Sender message you’re sending to your pen pal are coming from one person: you.</p>



<p>And if your pen pal replies, the reply will have his IP address on it (the same IP address Signal sent your messages to) and your phone number on it. And then, when you want to receive the reply, you have to connect to Signal’s servers using, again, your IP address (the same IP address you used to send your messages to your pen pal earlier). Just like that, with two messages, Signal figured out which phone number (yours) is talking to which other phone number (your pen pal’s). If they ever decide to try and figure out who own these two phone numbers, they could ask your telecoms, or simply search Facebook and Twitter.</p>



<p>You can’t avoid using IP addresses on the internet; they are a necessity on the internet. But you can use a VPN or Tor to mask your real IP address with a fake one that’s not tied to your identity. <strong>But you can’t do that with phone numbers.</strong> A phone number is either tied to your identity or it isn’t; there is no masking possible, unless you use a service like <a href="https://mysudo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MySudo</a> which <a href="https://mysudo.com/mysudo-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">isn’t available for most of us</a> (US and Canada only, as of this writing). If you’re fortunate enough to be able to buy a prepaid SIM without ID, then great, all you and your pen pal have to do is buy some SIM cards that aren’t tied to your identities. If buying a prepaid SIM without ID ain’t an option, then your phone number has to be tied to your identity, and Signal can use these unmasked phone numbers, in combination with masked or unmasked IP addresses, to figure out who’s talking to who, <em>despite Sealed Sender’s promises</em>, as long as there’s a two-way conversation going on.</p>



<p>Which brings up an interesting question: <strong>Why does Signal require phone numbers?</strong></p>



<blockquote>
<p>ʕ´•ᴥ•`ʔ: Hey, that is an interesting question…</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Signal works over the internet, and the internet requires IP (internet protocol) addresses in order to figure out where a message should go. But sending messages over the internet <strong>does not</strong> require phone numbers; that’s a requirement when using SMS or cellular calls or mobile data, <strong>but not for using the internet</strong>. And yet, the “privacy-protecting” Signal app requires you to use a phone number to send and receive messages…</p>



<blockquote>
<p>ʕ⚆ᴥ⚆ʔ: Hmmmm…</p>
</blockquote>



<h2>It’s always a two-way street</h2>



<p>It gets worse. I keep repeating this: <strong>two-way communication</strong>. Sealed Sender doesn’t work with <strong>two-way communication</strong>. But, I’ve kind of been lying. The truth is: <strong>Signal already knows which phone numbers have been talking to which, even with Sealed Sender and only one-way communication.</strong></p>



<blockquote>
<p>ʕ ಠ ᴥಠ ʔ: What?!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Do these check marks look familiar to you? (Forgive the pixelation.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ʕ·ᴥ·ʔ: Hm, yeah. Aren’t they the check marks that show up for at least a second whenever I send a Signal message? This is what’s shown after the lone check mark, and before they both turn white to indicate that my message was read, right?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That’s right. The lone check mark indicates that your Signal message was sent to Signal’s servers, these two check marks above indicate that your Signal message has been delivered to the recipient, and the two white check marks indicate that the recipient has read your Signal message.</p>



<p>Now, the thing about the two check marks above is that your Signal app only shows them when your phone has received what’s called a “delivery receipt” from the recipient’s phone. Whenever your pen pal gets a message from you, their Signal app sends a delivery receipt from their phone, through Signal’s servers, to your phone. Their Signal app does this <em>automatically and instantly</em>, and neither of you can turn it off. You can turn off read receipts (the two white check marks) and typing indicators, but you can’t turn off the <em>very first reply</em>: delivery receipts.</p>



<p>The delivery receipt is – <em>ahem</em> – also “protected” using Sealed Sender, but what was it that I’ve been saying this whole time is wrong with Sealed Sender?</p>

<p>Exactly. And you can’t turn it off. Go figure why.</p>



<h2>Some alternatives and a work in progress</h2>



<p>So if you can’t trust Signal, who can you trust? Well, if all you need is a private text-based communication channel that won’t falsely advertise their privacy guarantees to you, <a href="https://proton.me/mail" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Proton Mail</a> and <a href="https://tuta.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tutanota</a> (now called Tuta) are pretty good. But if you want private voice-based communication, then that’s gonna’ be a problem. WhatsApp is even worse than Signal, Telegram is <a href="https://sanesecurityguy.com/articles/the-limits-of-end-to-end-encryption/#end-to-end-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">even worse than WhatsApp</a>, Wire requires an email address to use it (another unnecessary requirement), and most of the rest can’t be trusted because they aren’t open-source.</p>



<p>You could use <a href="https://meet.jit.si/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jitsi</a> for voice communications, but you’d have to use a separate service for text communications. You could use <a href="https://matrix.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matrix</a> for both text and voice, but that’s a software and communication protocol, so you’d have to set up your own server running it. You could use <a href="https://element.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Element</a>, which runs Matrix servers, but you’d have to <a href="https://element.io/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trust Amazon and Cloudflare</a> with your metadata, making this a rather messy solution to a privacy problem.</p>



<p>What that leaves us with is a single service that is still a work in progress: <a href="https://simplex.chat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SimpleX</a>. It asks for no global identifiers like phone numbers or email addresses. It at least tries, unlike Signal, <em>to make sure that it doesn’t know who’s talking to who</em>. It does this with the use of proxies that you randomly send your messages through to get to your recipient (the <a href="https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplexmq/blob/master/protocol/overview-tjr.md#technical-details" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">technical details</a> of which are too complicated to get into here). Of course it is <a href="https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplex-chat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open-source</a> and end-to-end encrypted, otherwise I wouldn’t be mentioning it. It even goes so far as to <strong>allow you to use Tor</strong> with it, or any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOCKS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SOCKS</a> proxy. It’s pretty cool, actually; the most technically amazing communications platform I’ve ever seen.</p>



<p>But, it ain’t perfect. It’s kinda’ slow, and messages sometimes don’t come in in the right order or don’t come in at all. Voice calls are… iffy, particularly when using Tor. It is still a young, developing project, though it has been making great strides in improving itself, including <a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/SimpleXChat.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">getting a security audit</a>.</p>



<p>Time will tell how it turns out, but at least I can say one thing: we’ve got a viable alternative.</p>

        </p>
    

    <p>a few days after <a href="https://jenn.site/my-dad-could-still-be-alive-but-hes-not/">dad died</a>, we found the love letters, hidden away among his things. one of them said, <em>i love dota and i love peaches, but i love you more. i will quit smoking and lose weight for you. the happiest days of my life are the ones that start with you across the breakfast table from me.</em></p>
<p>my parents were not a love match. at 27 and 26, they were embarrassingly old by the standards of their small chinese port town. all four of my grandparents exerted enormous pressure to force them together.</p>
<p>my father fulfilled the familial obligations heaped on his shoulders without complaint. he didn't get along with my mother, or my younger brother, but this wasn't too bad; he often worked away from us (for months and even years on end), mostly in china, more recently in redacted, another canadian city.</p>
<p>the physical distance between us for most of my life has made his passing easier for me to come to terms with. i call him dad here but i didn't lose a dad, i lost someone who was abstractly a father to me. he was more often gone than there, had missed all of my graduations and birthday parties. there was one time he took care of me when i was sick. his hands on me were gentle, and he told me stories from chinese history while i lay feverish in bed. i was seven. this is approximately the only memory i have of him being a dad to me.</p>
<p>still, the two of us were close in our own way. sometimes, the two of us would go on long walks together. after fifteen minutes of silence, or twenty, something would loosen in him and he would start to tell me about the depths of his sadness and the disappointment in the way his life played out. i was good at not taking this personally. i didn't think he ever had a chance to be happy or authentic, his entire life. he sacrificed himself so i could.</p>
<p>i always thought that if he had a chance at happiness, he would be the gentle, funny, and sensitive aesthete that i caught glimpses of sometimes, instead of the bullheaded chinese patriarch others seemed to demand.</p>
<p>except it turns out he did have this chance after all. his lover and i ended up meeting soon after his death. edward lived in redacted, the city that my dad had worked in for the past year and a bit.</p>
<p>edward tells me their story, all in a rush. he and my dad had been seeing each other for three years, and had agreed to go exclusive a year and a half ago. they met while he was in china, and there was an instant spark between them, something special and precious that neither of them had felt before. dad convinced him to apply for a university program here in canada, to eventually get permanent residency in canada. so edward, in his 30s, sold his flourishing business and his house, and came to start over in a foreign land for the sake of being with him.</p>
<p>edward reckons they were engaged, or something like it; they lived together, toured open houses in redacted every weekend with every intent to buy something together, and there was an understanding that dad would soon come out, divorce my mother, and live in the open with edward for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>edward gave me some photos he had of my dad, and i could scarcely believe that they were of the grim, sad man i knew. he beams in all of them, glowing with joy, his smile more incandescent than i've ever seen in my entire life. i steal glances at edward, the person who took all those impossible photos. the person he was looking at.</p>
<p>my mind keeps stuttering to boskovitch's installation, that single box fan behind plexiglass. i imagine the course of events from edward's point of view: a year living with the love of your life, and then they are suddenly gone in an awful accident and you are too late to see them one last time, to attend the funeral. your own grief is an isolating thing because you are closeted and no one else knew who you were to each other. i wish we had gotten in touch sooner, but edward is grateful to be allowed any affordance, at all.</p>
<p>their life in redacted seemed similarly impossible: a life where my dad splurged on the treats he never did at home (hagen dazs ice cream, honeycrisp apples, nice shoes) and left the house on a regular basis to explore the city with the one he loves. a life where he felt safe enough to ask for kisses and cuddles because he knew they would be provided, even to <em>sa jiao</em> playfully. all i ever knew him to do at home was to sit in a stupor by the television set.</p>
<p>and there was a new hurt, but it was sweet, to imagine the way life could have been in ten years time, a life i've never previously imagined; dad happily with edward in a nice new house where i'd visit every so often, shoulders loose and smiling, and we'd get to talk, <em>actually</em> talk.</p>
<p>according to edward, my dad had known that he had liked men at least since his university years. that makes it almost forty years in the closet, then; just thinking about it makes me feel a sort of dizzying claustrophobia.</p>
<p>i came out to mom years before i came out to dad. when i did, mom told me that coming out to dad was not a good idea, because he was such a traditionalist and she didn't know how he would react. but i came out to him anyways, one quiet afternoon when i visited him in china, because i thought our relationship was good and that he can handle it, and i wanted him to know this about me.</p>
<p>when i did, he took it well. he told me that though the path i am on is a painful one, he would be there for me, and that the most important thing was to find <em>xin fu</em> in life, not to live your life in accordance to the expectations of anyone else. in my staggering relief i did not notice the confusion. i just felt so grateful to have had that understanding, a precious gift that i did not have any expectation of receiving. now, i feel only bereft of the conversations we never managed to have, and grief for the life he never got to live.</p>
<p>dad lives in my living room these days, in a box made of cherry wood, because mom didn't want him in the house after the truth came out. so when edward visited, he got to see him one last time, and say goodbye. he held the box in his arms and wept, spilling more tears and emotions than his biological family managed to, and i escaped to my room for the evening to give them some privacy.</p>
<p>did i mention the shrines? we set them up for the dead in our culture. we had ours, a formal thing in a cabinet, and we had knelt in front of it like we were supposed to, given the correct number of kowtows. edward shared with me pictures of his. it sprawled over the entirety of his dining table. it had packs of playing cards from the brand he liked best and his favourite cuts of meat and the wine he finished off the day with. every morning, he would play my dad's favourite songs to him. i didn't know my dad's favourite cuts of meat. i didn't know he drank wine. i didn't know he listened to music.</p>
<p>so of course i let them say goodbye to each other. when i went out of my room the next morning, he was still fully dressed on my couch, bedding untouched, staring blankly at the box in his lap. it gleamed red in the morning sun. he rose at my approach, put my dad back on the mantle with gentle hands, and then stood quietly at a perfect parade rest in front of him as i managed breakfast for the two of us. his flight back to redacted was that afternoon.</p>
<p>i don't know how to thank you for all this, he says. the chance to say goodbye. he was really proud of you, he spoke about you to me all the time. he never told me that you were gay. edward tells me that dad had plans to go back to redacted in a few weeks time and that he wanted to tell me everything before he left, but he was anxious about how i'd take it. i don't ask edward how many times he'd made the resolution to tell me before.</p>
<p>because you see, my dad was a coward. mom had started asking for divorces by the time i was in my teens, and dad was the one who always said no. he would complain to <em>her</em> mother, a traditionalist, to ensure that she would berate her daughter back into line. his family and his culture had no place for him, so he used her as a shield to make sure that he would be spared the scrutiny. slowly, we found evidence of other affairs, going back decades. of course my mother did not want him in the house.</p>
<p>i sit by my dad sometimes, and i make sure he always has a bowl of fresh fruit. fifty seven years, most of them suffocating and miserable, the last three of them shot through with so much joy his smile absolutely glows.</p>
<div><p><em>he wasted his entire life</em>, my mom said to me, the evening we found the love letters. <em>his entire life, and mine as well.</em></p><p>

<p>Three years ago, Google removed JPEG XL support from Chrome, stating there wasn’t enough interest at the time. That position has now changed.</p>



<p>In a recent note to developers, a Chrome team representative <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/WjCKcBw219k/m/NmOyvMCCBAAJ">confirmed </a>that work has restarted to bring JPEG XL to Chromium and said Google “would ship it in Chrome” once long-term maintenance and the usual launch requirements are met.</p>



<p>The team explained that other platforms moved ahead. Safari supports JPEG XL, and Windows 11 users can add native support through an image extension from Microsoft Store. The format is also confirmed for use in PDF documents. There has been continuous demand from developers and users who ask for its return.</p>



<p>Before Google ships the feature in Chrome, the company wants the integration to be secure and supported over time.</p>



<h2 id="h-chrome-jpeg-xl-implementation-adds-animation-support">Chrome JPEG XL implementation adds animation support</h2>



<p>A developer has submitted new code that reintroduces JPEG XL to Chromium. This version is marked as feature complete. The developer <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/WjCKcBw219k/m/NeiCV32tBAAJ">said</a> it also “includes animation support,” which earlier implementations did not offer. The code passes most of Chrome’s automated testing, but it remains under review and is not available to users.</p>



<p>The featured image is taken from an unlisted developer demo created for testing purposes.</p>



<p>JPEG XL is a newer image format intended as a replacement for traditional JPEG files. It can reduce file size without loss in visual quality. This may help web pages load faster and reduce data usage.  More details are available on the <a href="https://jpegxl.info/">official JPEG XL website</a>.</p>



<p>Google has not provided a timeline for JPEG XL support in Chrome. Users cannot enable the format today, but development has restarted after years without progress.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-3467012800646079318" itemprop="description articleBody">
<p>I've been studying the standard cell circuitry in the Intel 386 processor recently.
The 386, introduced in 1985, was Intel's most complex processor at the time, containing 285,000 transistors.
Intel's existing design techniques couldn't handle this complexity and the chip began to fall behind schedule.
To meet the schedule, the 386 team started using a technique called standard cell logic.
Instead of laying out each transistor manually, the layout process was performed by a computer.</p>
<p>The idea behind standard cell logic is to create standardized circuits (standard cells) for each type of logic element, such
as an inverter, NAND gate, or latch.
You feed your circuit description into software that selects the necessary cells, 
positions these cells into columns, and then routes the wiring between the cells.
This "automatic place and route" process creates the chip layout much faster than manual layout.
However, switching to standard cells was a risky decision since if the software couldn't create a
dense enough layout, the chip couldn't be manufactured.
But in the end, the 386 finished ahead of schedule, an almost unheard-of accomplishment.<span id="fnref:oral-history"><a href="#fn:oral-history">1</a></span></p>
<p>The 386's standard cell circuitry contains a few circuits that I didn't expect.
In this blog post, I'll take a quick look at some of these circuits:
surprisingly large multiplexers, a transistor that doesn't fit into the standard cell layout,
and inverters that turned out not to be inverters.
(If you want more background on standard cells in the 386, see my earlier post,
"<a href="https://www.righto.com/2024/01/intel-386-standard-cells.html">Reverse engineering standard cell logic in the Intel 386 processor</a>".)</p>
<p>The photo below shows the 386 die with the automatic-place-and-route regions highlighted; I'm focusing
on the red region in the lower right.
These blocks of logic have cells arranged in rows, giving them a characteristic striped appearance.
The dark stripes are the transistors that make up the logic gates, while the lighter regions between the stripes are the
"routing channels" that hold the wiring that connects the cells.
In comparison,
functional blocks
such as the datapath on the left
and the microcode ROM in the lower right
were designed manually to optimize density and performance, giving them a more solid appearance.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-curiosities/die-labeled.jpg"><img alt="The 386 die with the standard-cell regions highlighted." height="530" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-curiosities/die-labeled-w500.jpg" title="The 386 die with the standard-cell regions highlighted." width="500"></a></p><p>The 386 die with the standard-cell regions highlighted.</p>
<p>As for other features on the chip,
the black circles around the border are bond wire connections that go to the chip's external pins.
The chip has two metal layers, a small number by modern
standards, but a jump from the single metal layer of earlier processors such as the 286.
(Providing two layers of metal made automated routing practical: one layer can hold horizontal wires while the other layer
can hold vertical wires.)
The metal appears white in larger areas, but
purplish where circuitry underneath roughens its surface.
The underlying silicon and the polysilicon wiring are obscured by the metal layers.</p>
<h2>The giant multiplexers</h2>
<p>The standard cell circuitry that I'm examining (red box above) is part of the control logic that selects registers
while executing an instruction.
You might think that it is easy to select which registers take part in an instruction, but
due to the complexity of the x86 architecture, it is more difficult.
One problem is that a 32-bit register such as EAX can also be treated as the 16-bit register AX,
or two 8-bit registers AH and AL.
A second problem is that some instructions include a "direction" bit that switches the source and
destination registers.
Moreover, sometimes the register is specified by bits in the instruction, but in other cases,
the register is specified by the microcode.
Due to these factors, selecting the registers for an operation is a complicated process with many
cases, using control bits from the instruction, from the microcode, and from other sources.</p>
<p>Three registers need to be selected for an operation—two source registers and a destination register—and there
are about 17 cases that need to be handled.
Registers are specified with 7-bit control signals that select one of the 30 registers and control
which part of the register is accessed.
With three control signals, each 7 bits wide, and about 17 cases for each, you can see that
the register control logic is large and complicated.
(I wrote more about the 386's registers <a href="https://www.righto.com/2025/05/intel-386-register-circuitry.html">here</a>.)</p>
<p>I'm still reverse engineering the register control logic, so I won't go into details.
Instead, I'll discuss how the register control circuit uses multiplexers, implemented with standard cells.
A multiplexer is a circuit that combines multiple
input signals into a single output by selecting one of the inputs.<span id="fnref:one-hot"><a href="#fn:one-hot">2</a></span>
A multiplexer can be implemented with logic gates, for instance, by ANDing each input with the
corresponding control line, and then ORing the results together.
However, the 386 uses a different approach—CMOS switches—that avoids a large AND/OR gate.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-curiosities/cmos-switch.jpg"><img alt="Schematic of a CMOS switch." height="169" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-curiosities/cmos-switch-w200.jpg" title="Schematic of a CMOS switch." width="200"></a></p><p>Schematic of a CMOS switch.</p>
<p>The schematic above shows how a CMOS switch is constructed from two MOS transistors.
When the two transistors are on, the output is connected to the input, but when the two transistors are
off, the output is isolated.
An NMOS transistor is turned on when its input is high, but a PMOS transistor is turned on when its
input is <em>low</em>. Thus, the switch uses two control inputs, one inverted.
The motivation for using two transistors is that an NMOS transistor is better at pulling the output
low, while a PMOS transistor is better at pulling the output high, so combining them yields the best performance.<span id="fnref:6502"><a href="#fn:6502">3</a></span>
Unlike a logic gate, the CMOS switch has no amplification, so a signal is weakened as it passes through the switch.
As will be seen below, inverters can be used to amplify the signal.</p>
<p>The image below shows how CMOS switches appear under the microscope.
This image is very hard to interpret because the two layers of metal on the 386 are packed together densely, but you
can see that some wires run horizontally and others run vertically.
The bottom layer of metal (called M1) runs vertically in the routing area, as well as providing internal
wiring for a cell.
The top layer of metal (M2) runs horizontally; unlike M1, the M2 wires can cross a cell.
The large circles are vias that connect the M1 and M2 layers, while the small circles are connections
between M1 and polysilicon or M1 and silicon.
The central third of the image is a column of standard cells with two CMOS switches outlined in green.
The cells are bordered by the vertical ground rail and
+5V rail that power the cells. 
The routing areas are on either side of the cells, holding the wiring that connects the cells.</p>

<p>Removing the metal layers reveals the underlying silicon with a layer of polysilicon wiring on top.
The doped silicon regions show up as dark outlines.
I've drawn the polysilicon in green; it forms a transistor (brighter green) when it crosses doped silicon.
The metal ground and power lines are shown in blue and red, respectively, with other metal wiring in purple.
The black dots are vias between layers.
Note how metal wiring (purple) and polysilicon wiring (green) are combined to route signals within
the cell.
Although this standard cell is complicated, the important thing is that it only needs to be designed once.
The standard cells for different functions are all designed to have the same width, so the cells can be arranged in
columns, snapped together like Lego bricks.</p>

<p>To summarize, this switch circuit allows the input to be connected to the output or disconnected, controlled by the select signal.
This switch is more complicated than the earlier schematic because it includes two inverters to amplify
the signal.
The data input and the two select lines are connected to the polysilicon (green); the cell is designed so
these connections can be made on either side.
At the top, the input goes through a standard two-transistor inverter.
The lower left has two transistors, combining the NMOS half of an inverter with the NMOS half of the switch.
A similar circuit on the right combines the PMOS part of an inverter and switch.
However, because PMOS transistors are weaker, this part of the circuit is duplicated.</p>
<p>A multiplexer is constructed by combining multiple switches, one for each input.
Turning on one switch will select the corresponding input.
For instance, a four-to-one multiplexer has four switches, so it can select one of the four inputs.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-curiosities/mux4.jpg"><img alt="A four-way multiplexer constructed from CMOS switches and individual transistors." height="430" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-curiosities/mux4-w200.jpg" title="A four-way multiplexer constructed from CMOS switches and individual transistors." width="200"></a></p><p>A four-way multiplexer constructed from CMOS switches and individual transistors.</p>
<p>The schematic above shows a hypothetical multiplexer with four inputs.
One optimization is that if an input is always 0, the PMOS transistor can be omitted. Likewise,
if an input is always 1, the NMOS transistor can be omitted.
One set of select lines is activated at a time to select the corresponding input.
The pink circuit selects 1,
green selects input A, yellow selects input B, and blue selects 0.
The multiplexers in the 386 are similar, but have more inputs.</p>
<p>The diagram below shows how much circuitry is devoted to multiplexers in this block of standard cells.
The green, purple, and red cells correspond to the multiplexers driving the three register control
outputs.
The yellow cells are inverters that generate the inverted control signals for the CMOS switches.
This diagram also shows how the automatic layout of cells results in a layout that appears random.</p>

<h2>The misplaced transistor</h2>
<p>The idea of standard-cell logic is that standardized cells are arranged in columns.
The space between the cells is the "routing channel", holding the wiring that links the cells.
The 386 circuitry follows this layout, except for one single transistor, sitting between two columns
of cells.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-curiosities/extra-transistor.jpg"><img alt="The &quot;misplaced&quot; transistor, indicated by the arrow. The irregular green regions are oxide that was incompletely removed." height="433" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-curiosities/extra-transistor-w500.jpg" title="The &quot;misplaced&quot; transistor, indicated by the arrow. The irregular green regions are oxide that was incompletely removed." width="500"></a></p><p>The "misplaced" transistor, indicated by the arrow. The irregular green regions are oxide that was incompletely removed.</p>
<p>I wrote some software tools to help me analyze the standard cells. Unfortunately, my tools
assumed that all the cells were in columns, so this one wayward transistor caused me considerable inconvenience.</p>
<p>The transistor turns out to be a PMOS transistor, pulling a signal high as part of a multiplexer.
But why is this transistor out of place?
My hypothesis is that the transistor is a bug fix.
Regenerating the cell layout was very costly, taking many hours on an IBM mainframe computer.
Presumably, someone found that they could just stick the necessary transistor into an unused spot in the
routing channel, manually add the necessary wiring, and avoid the delay of regenerating all the cells.</p>
<h2>The fake inverter</h2>
<p>The simplest CMOS gate is the inverter, with an NMOS transistor to pull the output low and a
PMOS transistor to pull the output high.
The standard cell circuitry that I examined contains over a hundred inverters of various
sizes.
(Performance is improved by using inverters that aren't too small but also aren't
larger than necessary for a particular circuit. Thus, the standard cell library includes inverters of multiple sizes.)</p>
<p>The image below shows a medium-sized standard-cell inverter under the microscope.
For this image, I removed the two metal layers with acid to show the underlying polysilicon
(bright green) and silicon (gray).
The quality of this image is
poor—it is difficult to remove the metal without destroying the polysilicon—but the diagram below
should clarify the circuit.
The inverter has two transistors: a PMOS transistor connected to +5 volts to pull the output high when
the input is 0, and an NMOS transistor connected to ground to pull the output low when the input is 1.
(The PMOS transistor needs to be larger because PMOS transistors don't function as well as NMOS transistors due to
silicon physics.)</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-curiosities/inverter-diagram.jpg"><img alt="An inverter as seen on the die. The corresponding standard cell is shown below." height="347" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-curiosities/inverter-diagram-w450.jpg" title="An inverter as seen on the die. The corresponding standard cell is shown below." width="450"></a></p><p>An inverter as seen on the die. The corresponding standard cell is shown below.</p>
<p>The polysilicon input line plays a key role: where it crosses the doped silicon, a transistor gate is
formed.
To make the standard cell more flexible, the input to the inverter
can be connected on either the left or the right; in this case, the input
is connected on the right and there is no connection on the left.
The inverter's output can be taken from the polysilicon on the upper left or the right, but in this case, it
is taken from the upper metal layer (not shown).
The power, ground, and output lines are in the lower metal layer, which I have represented by
the thin red, blue, and yellow lines. The black circles are connections between the metal layer and
the underlying silicon.</p>
<p>This inverter appears dozens of times in the circuitry.
However, I came across a few inverters that didn't make sense. The problem was
that the inverter's output was connected to the output of a multiplexer.
Since an inverter is either on or off, its value would clobber the output of the multiplexer.<span id="fnref:latch"><a href="#fn:latch">4</a></span>
This didn't make any sense.
I double- and triple-checked the wiring to make sure I hadn't messed up.
After more investigation, I found another problem: the input to a "bad" inverter didn't make sense
either. The input consisted of two signals shorted together, which doesn't work.</p>
<p>Finally, I realized what was going on. A "bad inverter" has the exact silicon layout of an inverter,
but it wasn't an inverter: it was independent NMOS and PMOS transistors with separate inputs.
Now it all made sense.
With two inputs, the input signals were independent, not shorted together.
And since the transistors were controlled separately, the NMOS transistor could pull the output
low in some circumstances, the PMOS transistor could pull the output high in other circumstances,
or both transistors could be off, allowing the multiplexer's output to be used undisturbed.
In other words, the "inverter" was just two more cases for the multiplexer.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-curiosities/transistors-die.jpg"><img alt="The &quot;bad&quot; inverter. (Image is flipped vertically for comparison with the previous inverter.)" height="177" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-curiosities/transistors-die-w450.jpg" title="The &quot;bad&quot; inverter. (Image is flipped vertically for comparison with the previous inverter.)" width="450"></a></p><p>The "bad" inverter. (Image is flipped vertically for comparison with the previous inverter.)</p>
<p>If you compare the "bad inverter" cell below with the previous cell, they look <em>almost</em> the same, but
there are subtle differences.
First, the gates of the two transistors are connected in the real inverter, but disconnected
by a small gap in the transistor pair.
I've indicated this gap in the photo above; it is hard to tell if the gap is real or just an imaging
artifact, so I didn't spot it.
The second difference is that the "fake" inverter has two input connections, one to each transistor,
while the inverter has a single input connection.
Unfortunately, I assumed that the two connections were just a trick to route the signal across
the inverter without requiring an extra wire.
In total, this cell was used 32 times as a real inverter and 9 times
as independent transistors.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Standard cell logic and automatic place and route have a long history before the 386,
back to the early 1970s, so this isn't an Intel invention.<span id="fnref:standard-cell-history"><a href="#fn:standard-cell-history">5</a></span>
Nonetheless, the 386 team deserves the credit for deciding to use this technology at a time when it
was a risky decision.
They needed to develop custom software for their placing and routing needs, so this wasn't a trivial undertaking.
This choice paid off and they completed the 386 ahead of schedule.
The 386 ended up being a huge success for Intel, moving the x86 architecture to 32 bits and defining the dominant computer
architecture for the rest of the 20th century.</p>

While this works well for many use cases, it creates friction when tools need to present visual information or gather complex user input.</p><p>For example, consider a data visualization MCP server that returns chart data as JSON. The host application must interpret that data and render it. Handling all kinds of specialized data in this scenario translates to a significant burden for client developers, who would need to build their own logic to render the UI. As more UI requirements come up, like the need to collect multiple related settings from users, the complexity balloons. Alternatively, without UI support, these interactions become awkward exchanges of text prompts and responses.</p><p>The MCP community has been creative in working around these limitations, but different implementations using varying conventions and architectures make it harder for servers to work consistently across clients. This lack of standardization creates a real risk of ecosystem fragmentation - something we’re working to proactively prevent.</p><h2 id="building-together">Building together</h2><p>The <a href="https://github.com/MCP-UI-Org/mcp-ui">MCP-UI project</a>, created by <a href="https://github.com/idosal">Ido Salomon</a> and <a href="https://github.com/liady">Liad Yosef</a> and maintained by a dedicated community, spearheaded the vision of agentic apps with interactive interfaces. The project developed patterns for delivering rich user interfaces as first-class MCP resources, proving that agentic apps fit naturally within the MCP architecture. The project is backed by a large community and provides <a href="https://mcpui.dev/guide/client/overview">rich SDKs</a>, adopted at leading companies and projects such as Postman, Shopify, Hugging Face, Goose, and ElevenLabs.</p><p>The <a href="https://developers.openai.com/apps-sdk/">OpenAI Apps SDK</a> further validated the demand for rich UI experiences within conversational AI interfaces. The SDK enables developers to build rich, interactive applications inside ChatGPT using MCP as its backbone. To ensure interoperability and establish consistent security and usage patterns across the ecosystem, Anthropic, OpenAI, and MCP-UI are collaborating to create an official MCP extension for interactive interfaces.</p><p><img alt="Example of a fullscreen app with a rich data table interface" loading="lazy" src="http://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/images/fullscreen-chat-app.png"></p><h2 id="mcp-apps-extension-specification">MCP Apps Extension specification</h2><p>We’re proposing a specification for UI resources in MCP, but the implications go further than just a set of schema changes.

<pre>The GCC Steering Committee has agreed to include the Algol 68 Front End in
trunk designated as experimental with stipulations:

1. Algol 68 is not part of all languages built by default.
2. Algol 68 is not part of the GCC release criteria.
3. All GCC developers who are not responsible for the Algol 68 Front End
may decline to work on issues related to the Algol 68 Front End.
4. If the Algol 68 Front End bit rots or is not maintained, it will be
removed.

To permit Algol 68 development to continue, Jose E. Marchesi is appointed
as Algol 68 front end maintainer.

If maintaining a Front End outside of trunk is difficult, the Algol 68
developers are invited to propose concrete changes to make it easier to
maintain front ends in a branch of the GCC repository outside of trunk.

Happy Hacking!
David

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>Germany plans to treat the use of date rape drugs like the use of weapons in prosecutions as part of measures to ensure justice for survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault.</p><p>“We classify date rape drugs, which are increasingly used as a widespread tool in crimes, as weapons. This creates the basis for significantly stricter prosecutions,” Alexander Dobrindt, the interior minister, said on Friday. “We are committed to clear consequences and consistent enforcement. Women should feel safe and be able to move freely everywhere.”</p><p>Nearly 54,000 women and girls were the victims of sexual offences in Germany in 2024 – an increase of 2.1% on the previous year – of which nearly 36% were victims of rape and sexual assault.</p><p>A parliamentary debate over a bill calling for a mandatory minimum five-year prison sentence for the use of date rape drugs in sexual assaults was postponed last month.</p><p>Police last year registered a record high of almost 266,000 domestic violence victims, a 3.8% increase on the previous year. However, there were a high number of unreported cases, the head of the federal criminal police office, Holger Münch, said.</p><p>“We must work to ensure that more victims find the courage to report crimes in order to improve the protection and support for victims,” he added.</p><p>Although there is no uniform federal definition for femicide in Germany, nearly 1,200 women and girls were recorded as victims of homicide or attempted homicide in 2024, a slight decrease year on year.</p><p>The German government this week approved a draft law allowing the use of electronic ankle monitors to track perpetrators of domestic violence. Victims can also request a separate device to warn them when the perpetrator is nearby.</p><p>Dobrindt said the government had also secured funding for the national rollout of an app allowing domestic abuse victims to secretly document abuse incidents to be used later in court.</p></div></div>]]></description>

My neighbor has the same outages. Xfinity won’t fix it.</strong></h2><p>I bought Xfinity internet in June 2024. Immediately, my connection started dropping. Multiple times a day. Every single day. After troubleshooting every piece of equipment I had and questioning my sanity my neighbor complained about the same thing which led me to understand this was not my equipment.</p><p>I set up an uptime monitor and found that these outages happen 6-7 times per day for 125 seconds.</p><p>Over 17 months of my service term that’s approximately 3,387 outage incidents totaling 117+ hours of cumulative downtime.</p><p>This outage pattern has recurred thousands of times. It is consistent, predictable, and it follows an automated schedule.</p><p>My neighbor has the same problem. Different house. Different line from a different junction box.

Multiple times. They blamed my WiFi (I’m hardwired). They blamed my modem (an Xfinity Approved MB8611 that worked without fault on Wave Broadband and Spectrum). They blamed my router (I tested with multiple devices). They sent a subcontracted technician. Then another subcontracted technician. Then a subcontracted crew. The crew ran a new coax line and grounded it to a water pipe that turns into PVC when it enters the ground (this doesn’t ground anything). Then they sent an Xfinity technician to look at the line.</p><p>The problem never changed. The only thing that changed is my download speed dropped from advertised 1200Mbps to &lt;500Mbps.</p><div id="mai-gallery-3"><figure><a href="https://i0.wp.com/sacbear.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-3.png?fit=300%2C242&amp;ssl=1" data-gallery="mai-gallery-3" data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" data-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/sacbear.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-3.png?resize=300%2C242&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/sacbear.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-3.png?resize=768%2C621&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/sacbear.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-3.png?resize=1024%2C827&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/sacbear.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-3.png?w=1380&amp;ssl=1 1380w" data-glightbox="description:For my trouble of reporting a network outage I lost 700Mbps in speed.

This is a 1200Mbps plan.</figcaption></figure></div><p>I escalated to retention. They offered me nothing. I provided detailed technical documentation showing the exact pattern of the outages, the minute markers they occur at, the exact duration every single time. They didn’t understand it. They couldn’t escalate it.</p><p>I was transferred to technical support. The person did not care and put me on speaker phone with so much background noise I couldn’t hear myself think. I imagine he was rolling his eyes while trying his utmost to care less.</p><h2><strong>My Neighbor’s Attempts to Fix It</strong></h2><p>He called Xfinity about his TV cutting out repeatedly. The technician told him his UPS grounding his coax cable was causing the problem. So he ungrounded the cable, pocketed the spare cable, and my neighbor kept having the same issues.</p><h2><strong>What I Found</strong></h2><p>Just in the last 72 hours I have documented 20 consecutive outages using OPNSense’s built in gateway uptime monitor. Here’s what they show:</p><p><strong>Every single outage lasted 124.8 ± 1.3 seconds.</strong> That’s not random hardware failure. That’s a timeout value hardcoded into something in Xfinity’s infrastructure.</p><p><strong>The outages cluster at specific minute markers.</strong> 35% start at minute :44. 35% start at minute :29. This is scheduled automation. This is likely a cron job or automated task running at those exact times every hour.</p><p><strong>The outages peak at specific hours.</strong> Most happen between noon and 1 PM. Others cluster in early morning around 2-3 AM. This is not random.</p><p>This is an infrastructure problem on Xfinity’s network. Not on my end. Not on my neighbor’s end. Upstream. Somewhere on their equipment something is failing for exactly 125 seconds multiple times per day.</p><p>I have the data. I have the patterns. I have another customer (my neighbor) on a different line experiencing the exact same thing.</p><p>Xfinity has all this information. They know about the problem. They just won’t investigate it.</p><h2><strong>Why They Won’t Fix It</strong></h2><ol><li><strong>Support can’t understand technical data.</strong> They follow scripts. When I attempted to explain monitoring logs they had no framework for discussing it. They blamed my equipment because that’s what they’re trained to do.</li><li><strong>Nobody has authority to escalate.</strong> Retention transferred me to tech support. Tech support couldn’t care nor help. They dug up my yard and placed a new line which did nothing to solve the problem. Nobody would actually order an investigation into the upstream infrastructure.</li><li><strong>There’s no pressure to fix it.</strong> Xfinity is the only gigabit provider in this area. No competition. No alternatives. I can’t leave. So they don’t have to care.</li><li><strong>A 2-minute outage every few hours is “tolerable.”</strong> It’s annoying enough to frustrate customers but not enough to make them quit (since they have nowhere else to go). It’s cheap to ignore compared to actually investigating and fixing it.</li></ol><p><strong>There’s Also a Security Problem</strong></p><p>About half of the Xfinity junction boxes in my neighborhood are unlocked or broken. Anyone can walk up and disconnect whomever they want.</p><p>If your home security system is on Xfinity with no wireless backup, someone can just walk to the street and physically disconnect your internet, rob your house, and your security system won’t notify you.</p><h2><strong>I’m Out of Options</strong></h2><p>I’ve done everything I can do as a customer:</p><ul><li>Documented the problem professionally</li><li>Escalated through all available channels</li><li>Provided technical evidence</li><li>Been ignored at every level</li></ul><p>The problem is real. My neighbor confirms it. Everyone downstream of whatever is broken on their infrastructure probably has it too.</p><p>I can’t fix this. Only Xfinity can.

            <h2 id="10-the-silicon-root-of-trust-pre-boot-hardware-primitives">1.0 The Silicon Root of Trust: Pre-Boot &amp; Hardware Primitives</h2>
<p>The security of the macOS platform on Apple Silicon is not defined by the kernel; it is defined by the physics of the die. Before the first instruction of <code>kernelcache</code> is fetched, a complex, cryptographic ballet has already concluded within the Application Processor (AP). This section dissects the immutable hardware logic that establishes the initial link in the Chain of Trust.</p>
<h3 id="11-the-reset-vector-boot-rom-securerom">1.1 The Reset Vector &amp; Boot ROM (SecureROM)</h3>
<p>The Apple Silicon boot process begins in a state of absolute trust, anchored by the Boot ROM (often colloquially referred to as SecureROM). This code is mask-programmed into the silicon during fabrication. It is immutable, unpatchable, and serves as the hardware root of trust for the entire platform.</p>
<h4 id="111-execution-at-reset-analyzing-the-reset-vector-rvbarelx">1.1.1 Execution at Reset: Analyzing the Reset Vector (<code>RVBAR_ELx</code>)</h4>
<p>Upon Power-On Reset (POR), the cores of the M-series SoC (and A-series) initialize in the highest privilege state implemented by the microarchitecture. In the Armv8/v9 architecture, this role is architecturally associated with <strong>Exception Level 3 (EL3)</strong> and its reset vector register family <code>RVBAR_ELx</code>. On Apple Silicon, public reverse engineering strongly suggests that Apple does <strong>not</strong> expose a persistent, software-visible EL3 monitor in the style of classical TrustZone. Instead, the Application Processor (AP) Boot ROM executes in an implementation-defined reset context that has strictly higher privilege than the runtime EL2/EL1 kernel environment and is the only code allowed to touch certain secure configuration registers.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this discussion, the important property is not the exact architectural EL label, but that the Boot ROM runs in a <strong>one-shot, highest-privilege reset context</strong> that:</p>
<ul>
<li>owns the reset vector (<code>RVBAR_ELx</code>) and initial exception state, and</li>
<li>can program security-critical registers that are later hidden from or read-only to EL2/EL1.</li>
</ul>
<p>The execution flow begins at the address defined in the <strong>Reset Vector Base Address Register</strong> (one of the <code>RVBAR_ELx</code> registers, depending on the concrete implementation). Reverse engineering of recent Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) indicates the memory map places the Boot ROM at a high base address, typically observed around <code>0x100000000</code>.</p>
<p><strong>The Initial Instruction Stream:</strong></p>
<p>The very first instructions executed by the silicon are responsible for establishing a sane C execution environment from a raw hardware state. Analysis of the entry point in similar Apple SoCs reveals a standard initialization sequence:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Interrupt Masking:</strong> The <code>DAIF</code> bits are set to mask all interrupts (IRQ, FIQ, SError, Debug). The Boot ROM operates in a strictly polled mode; interrupts are nondeterministic and introduce attack surface.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cache Invalidation:</strong> The instruction and data caches are invalidated to prevent cold-boot attacks or stale data usage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stack Setup:</strong> The Stack Pointer for the reset context (architecturally <code>SP_EL3</code>, but on Apple Silicon effectively the highest-privilege stack pointer) is initialized to point to a dedicated region of on-chip SRAM. DRAM is <strong>not</strong> initialized at this stage. The Boot ROM runs entirely within the constraints of the SoC’s internal SRAM.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>MMU Configuration:</strong> The System Control Register for the reset context (<code>SCTLR_ELx</code> at the highest implemented level) is programmed to enable the MMU, mapping the Boot ROM text as Read-Only/Executable and the SRAM stack/heap as Read-Write/No-Execute.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>RE Note:</strong> Apple’s high-privilege reset context is ephemeral. There is no persistent EL3 monitor analogous to Qualcomm’s QSEE. Once the Boot ROM has initialized hardware, validated and decrypted the next stage, and “demoted” the core into the runtime EL2/EL1 regime, the reset context is no longer reachable. Subsequent firmware (LLB, iBoot, XNU) can observe the effects of its configuration but cannot re-enter that privilege level or read back the Boot ROM contents directly.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="112-the-gid-key-group-id-hardware-entangled-decryption">1.1.2 The GID Key (Group ID): Hardware-entangled Decryption</h4>
<p>The Boot ROM’s primary objective is to load the Low-Level Bootloader (LLB). However, the LLB stored on the boot medium is not a raw binary; it is wrapped in an Image4 (<code>img4</code>) container, and its payload (<code>IM4P</code>) is both encrypted and, on production devices, <em>personalized</em>.</p>
<p>At the heart of this process is the <strong>GID Key (Group ID Key)</strong>.</p>
<p>The GID Key is a 256-bit AES key fused into the silicon during manufacturing. It is shared across processors of the same class (e.g., all M3 Pro chips share a GID, distinct from M3 Max), and it never leaves the confines of the on-die crypto hardware.</p>
<p><strong>KBAG Unwrapping: GID as a Wrapping Key</strong></p>
<p>Image4 payloads do not store the LLB ciphertext encrypted “directly under GID.” Instead, they contain an embedded <strong>Keybag (KBAG)</strong>: a small structure that holds per-image AES keys and IVs encrypted under the GID (and, where applicable, UID) keys.</p>
<p>The flow is:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Manifest &amp; Payload Parsing:</strong><br>
The Boot ROM parses the Image4 container, separates the <code>IM4M</code> (Manifest) from the <code>IM4P</code> (Payload), and locates the KBAG for the LLB within <code>IM4P</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>KBAG Decryption (GID Slot):</strong><br>
The KBAG consists of one or more wrapped key records (e.g., development vs. production keys). To unwrap the appropriate record, the Boot ROM:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writes the KBAG ciphertext (the wrapped IV+key material) into the AES engine’s input FIFO.</li>
<li>Programs the AES configuration register to use the <strong>GID key slot</strong> as the decryption source (a “use GID” control bit or mode selector).</li>
<li>Triggers the engine. The hardware AES block internally reads the GID key from fuses, decrypts the KBAG fragment, and emits the plaintext IV and AES key for the LLB.</li>
</ul>
<p>The GID value itself is never exposed to software; only the result of the KBAG unwrap is visible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>LLB Payload Decryption (Target Key):</strong><br>
With the per-image AES key and IV recovered from the KBAG, the Boot ROM then decrypts the LLB payload:</p>
<ul>
<li>It configures the AES engine (or, on some generations, uses the ARMv8 AES instructions) with the <strong>target key</strong> obtained from the KBAG.</li>
<li>It streams the LLB ciphertext through this AES context into SRAM, yielding the plaintext LLB image.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Zeroization:</strong><br>
After decryption, the AES hardware clears any internal registers holding the GID-derived material. The Boot ROM code has no mechanism to read back the GID key and no direct path to expose the target key outside the immediate decryption context.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This two-stage scheme (GID → KBAG → LLB) is what makes the system <strong>hardware-entangled</strong>: the cryptographic key that ultimately decrypts the bootloader exists only as the output of a GID-protected unwrap on <em>that</em> class of silicon.</p>
<p><strong>Exploit Implication:</strong></p>
<p>Even if an attacker gains arbitrary code execution inside the Boot ROM (as in <code>checkm8</code>-class vulnerabilities on earlier A-series devices), they still cannot extract the raw GID key and cannot perform offline decryption of production firmware:</p>
<ul>
<li>The GID key is never mapped into general-purpose registers or memory.</li>
<li>The only decryption primitive available is “unwrap KBAG under GID,” running <em>inside</em> the AES peripheral.</li>
<li>Firmware images must be decrypted <strong>on-device</strong>, with the AES engine acting as a constrained decryption oracle at best, and only for keys/payloads consistent with the KBAG format accepted by the ROM.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="113-the-public-key-accelerator-pka-hardware-enforced-verification">1.1.3 The Public Key Accelerator (PKA): Hardware-Enforced Verification</h4>
<p>Decryption provides confidentiality, but not integrity. To prevent the execution of malicious firmware, the Boot ROM enforces strict code signing using the <strong>Public Key Accelerator (PKA)</strong>.</p>
<p>The PKA is a dedicated hardware block optimized for asymmetric cryptography (RSA and ECC). The verification flow is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Root of Trust:</strong> The Apple Root CA public key is embedded directly within the immutable Boot ROM code. This serves as the anchor for the chain of trust.</li>
<li><strong>Manifest Parsing:</strong> The Boot ROM parses the Image4 (img4) container of the LLB. It extracts the Image4 Manifest (IM4M), which contains the payload's signature and the certificate chain used to sign it.</li>
<li><strong>Key Verification:</strong> The Boot ROM validates the certificate chain found in the manifest against the Root CA embedded in the ROM. If the chain is invalid or does not lead back to the hardware anchor, the boot halts (the device typically enters DFU/Recovery mode).</li>
<li><strong>Signature Verification:</strong> The Boot ROM offloads the signature verification to the PKA. It passes the hash of the payload (typically SHA-2 family) and the RSA/ECC signature. The PKA performs the mathematical verification and returns a boolean result to a status register.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Fault Injection Hardening:</strong><br>
Analysis of recent Apple Boot ROMs suggests the implementation of glitch-resistant logic around the PKA check. Rather than a simple <code>B.EQ</code> (Branch if Equal) instruction following the PKA result—which could be bypassed via voltage glitching—reverse engineering indicates the code often employs redundant checks, loop invariants, or specific register values that must be populated by the PKA hardware itself to allow the boot flow to proceed.</p>
<h4 id="114-re-focus-dev-vs-prod-fused-silicon">1.1.4 RE Focus: Dev vs. Prod Fused Silicon</h4>
<p>For reverse engineering and exploit development, distinguishing <strong>Development (Dev-fused)</strong> from <strong>Production (Prod)</strong> silicon is critical. The Boot ROM and security subsystem change behavior based on fuse fields that encode the <em>security domain</em> of the chip.</p>
<p>A central knob here is Apple’s <strong>CPFM</strong> field (“Chip Production / Firmware Mode”), burned into fuses and exposed in various debug logs and DFU responses.</p>
<p><strong>CPFM Observations:</strong></p>
<p>Across multiple generations, public Boot ROM banners and tooling logs show a consistent pattern:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>CPFM 0x0 / 0x1:</strong><br>
Used for <em>development</em> or internal security domains:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enable richer debug visibility.</li>
<li>Allow additional boot modes and demotion paths.</li>
<li>Often relax some signature enforcement or allow alternate signing roots for internal firmware.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>CPFM 0x3:</strong><br>
Standard <strong>production</strong> configuration for consumer devices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full signature enforcement for all boot stages.</li>
<li>No public demotion path.</li>
<li>Debug interfaces (JTAG/SWD) and invasive trace disabled or tightly restricted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The exact semantics of intermediary values (e.g., <code>0x2</code>) and the precise bit-level encoding are SoC- and generation-specific, but the broad distinction above is stable across published ROM dumps and DFU tooling.</p>
<p><strong>Production (CPFM ≈ 0x3):</strong></p>
<p>This is the configuration for retail hardware:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>JTAG / SWD:</strong> Disabled or heavily locked. External debug probes cannot halt the core at reset in any supported way.</li>
<li><strong>GID Behavior:</strong> The GID key is set to the production group value, shared only across chips of the same class, and never accessible via software.</li>
<li><strong>Boot Policy:</strong> The Boot ROM enforces the full Apple Root CA chain and Image4 constraints. Unsupported or revoked OS builds fail before DRAM initialization, dropping the device into DFU.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Development (CPFM ≈ 0x0 / 0x1):</strong></p>
<p>Dev-fused devices, including security research units and internal engineering hardware, typically relax some of these constraints:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>JTAG Enablement:</strong> The <code>DBGEN</code> / <code>SPIDEN</code> debug signals are asserted. Hardware debuggers (Lauterbach, Astris, etc.) can halt the core immediately after reset and single-step Boot ROM code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Demotion:</strong> Dev-fused chips can usually enter “demoted” modes where unsigned or custom-signed firmware images are bootable. The exact mechanisms (special DFU commands, provisioning profiles, or special Image4 manifests) are implementation details, but the high-level effect is that certain signature and version checks are bypassed or altered for internal workflows.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>GID Key Variance:</strong> Dev silicon often uses a distinct GID key (or set of keys) from production. This means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firmware encrypted for Prod cannot be decrypted on Dev, and vice versa.</li>
<li>Dev images are cryptographically bound to dev-fused hardware, preventing accidental cross-leakage into production units.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Identifying Silicon State in Practice:</strong></p>
<p>From the outside, the security domain can be inferred via DFU and other low-level interfaces:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>DFU Responses:</strong><br>
USB DFU responses (e.g., from <code>irecovery</code>, <code>ipwndfu</code>, or equivalent tooling) expose fields such as <code>CPID</code>, <code>ECID</code>, and CPFM-like indicators. On many platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Values where CPFM-like bits are <code>0x3</code> correspond to production devices.</li>
<li>Values where CPFM-like bits are <code>0x0</code> or <code>0x1</code> correspond to dev-fused hardware.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>CHIP_ID</code> / <code>ECID</code> Patterns:</strong><br>
Reverse-engineering tools often apply heuristic masks to these fields to classify devices. For example, certain high bits set in <code>CHIP_ID</code> or specific ranges in <code>ECID</code> are empirically associated with production vs. development, but the exact encodings vary by SoC and should be treated as version-specific heuristics rather than universal rules.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The “Un-dumpable” Region:</strong></p>
<p>Regardless of dev or prod state, once the Boot ROM prepares to jump to the next stage (LLB), it typically performs a lockdown sequence:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writes to the memory controller or system registers to unmap its own address range (e.g., around <code>0x100000000</code>) from the normal physical address space.</li>
<li>Ensures that any subsequent attempt by LLB or the kernel to read that region either raises a bus error or returns zeros.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is why practical Boot ROM dumps require a vulnerability <em>during</em> the Boot ROM execution window (e.g., <code>checkm8</code>-style exploits or carefully timed glitching) rather than a simple read from a later boot stage. On production (CPFM ≈ 0x3) devices this window is tightly constrained; on dev-fused hardware, JTAG/SWD access and relaxed policy make that window significantly easier to instrument but do not fundamentally change the “self-erasing” behavior.</p>
<h3 id="12-proprietary-isa-extensions-arm64e">1.2 Proprietary ISA Extensions (arm64e+)</h3>
<p>While the M-series cores implement the Armv8-A architecture with a comprehensive set of optional extensions (e.g., <code>FEAT_PAuth</code>, <code>FEAT_BTI</code>), Apple has aggressively extended the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) with proprietary logic. For the reverse engineer, standard Arm documentation is insufficient. Understanding the security posture of macOS Tahoe requires mastering these custom extensions, as they form the hardware enforcement layer for the new kernel isolation model.</p>
<h4 id="121-pointer-authentication-pac-the-cryptographic-control-flow">1.2.1 Pointer Authentication (PAC): The Cryptographic Control Flow</h4>
<p>Apple’s implementation of Armv8.3-PAuth is the most pervasive security mitigation in the XNU kernel. It repurposes the unused high-order bits above the configured virtual address size (the "top" bits of a 64-bit pointer) to store a cryptographic signature, or Pointer Authentication Code (PAC).</p>
<p><strong>The Key Hierarchy:</strong><br>
The hardware maintains five distinct 128-bit keys in system registers. On macOS with VHE (Virtualization Host Extensions) enabled, the kernel accesses these keys via the <code>_EL1</code> register aliases, which the hardware redirects to the EL2 bank of the key registers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>APIAKey</code> / <code>APIBKey</code> (Instruction):</strong> Signs code pointers (function pointers, return addresses).</li>
<li><strong><code>APDAKey</code> / <code>APDBKey</code> (Data):</strong> Signs data pointers. Crucial for protecting C++ vtables in IOKit (<code>OSObject</code>).</li>
<li><strong><code>APGAKey</code> (Generic):</strong> Signs arbitrary data blobs, effectively a hardware-accelerated MAC.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The <code>AUT</code> Failure Mechanism (Canonical Non-Valid):</strong><br>
For the reverse engineer analyzing crash dumps, understanding the failure mode is critical. When an <code>AUT*</code> instruction (e.g., <code>AUTIA</code>) is executed on a corrupted or forged pointer, the CPU does <strong>not</strong> immediately raise an exception.</p>
<p>Instead, the hardware corrupts the pointer in a deterministic way to ensure it causes a translation fault upon dereference.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Validation:</strong> The CPU recalculates the PAC.</li>
<li><strong>Mismatch:</strong> If the calculated PAC does not match the bits in the pointer, the CPU writes an error pattern into the PAC field, flipping specific high-order bits.</li>
<li><strong>Result:</strong> The pointer becomes a "canonical non-address": the PAC field is overwritten with an error pattern so that any use of the pointer leads to an architectural fault.</li>
<li><strong>Crash:</strong> The subsequent <code>LDR</code> or <code>BLR</code> triggers a Data Abort or Prefetch Abort.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>RE Tip:</strong> Empirically, on many M-series SoCs, a PAC authentication failure often manifests as a pointer where the upper byte is partially set (e.g., <code>0x007f...</code> or <code>0x00ff...</code>). If you see a crash involving such a pointer, you are likely looking at a PAC failure rather than a standard NULL dereference or heap corruption.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="122-branch-target-identification-bti-the-landing-pads">1.2.2 Branch Target Identification (BTI): The Landing Pads</h4>
<p>Often deployed in tandem with PAC (<code>-mbranch-protection=standard</code>), BTI mitigates Jump-Oriented Programming (JOP). It enforces a state machine on indirect branches.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Marking Pages:</strong> The Page Table Entries (PTE) now include a Guarded Page (<code>GP</code>) bit.</li>
<li><strong>The <code>BTI</code> Instruction:</strong> This is a "hint" instruction (NOP on older silicon). It acts as a valid landing pad.</li>
<li><strong>Enforcement:</strong> When the CPU executes an indirect branch (<code>BR</code>, <code>BLR</code>) targeting a Guarded Page, the very next instruction <strong>must</strong> be a <code>BTI</code> instruction of the correct type (<code>c</code> for call, <code>j</code> for jump, <code>jc</code> for both).</li>
</ul>
<p>If the target is not a <code>BTI</code> instruction, the CPU raises a <strong>Branch Target Exception</strong>. In XNU, observations suggest this often manifests as a <code>SIGILL</code> (Illegal Instruction) with a specific subcode, distinguishing it from standard undefined opcode exceptions. For exploit development, this necessitates finding gadgets that not only perform the desired operation but are also preceded by a valid landing pad.</p>
<h4 id="123-new-in-tahoe-the-guarded-execution-feature-gxf">1.2.3 <strong>New in Tahoe:</strong> The Guarded Execution Feature (GXF)</h4>
<p>This is the most significant architectural divergence in the Apple Silicon era. Standard Arm defines a vertical privilege stack (EL0 → EL1 → EL2). Apple has introduced a parallel execution domain, conceptually a <strong>Secure World</strong> (distinct from Arm TrustZone), accessed via <strong>Guarded Levels (GL)</strong>.</p>
<p>GXF allows the processor to switch between the "Normal World" (where macOS runs) and the "Secure World" (where Exclaves run). These worlds share the same physical silicon but possess vastly different hardware permissions and system register views.</p>
<p><strong>The Privilege Hierarchy:</strong><br>
The Guarded Levels mirror the standard Exception Levels but exist within the isolated Secure World context. The mapping for macOS Tahoe is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Normal World (macOS):</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>EL0:</strong> Userland processes (Apps, Daemons).</li>
<li><strong>EL2:</strong> The XNU Kernel. (Note: On macOS Apple Silicon, the kernel runs at EL2 using Virtualization Host Extensions (VHE) to support hypervisor functions. On iOS, it typically runs at EL1).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Secure World (Exclaves):</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>GL0:</strong> <strong>Conclaves</strong> (secure user workloads) and a privileged Conclave hosting the <strong>Trusted Execution Monitor (TXM)</strong>. This is where policy logic, privacy indicators, and Passkey logic reside.</li>
<li><strong>GL1:</strong> <strong>The Secure Kernel (ExclaveOS)</strong>. An L4-inspired microkernel responsible for scheduling and IPC within the secure world.</li>
<li><strong>GL2:</strong> <strong>The Secure Page Table Monitor (SPTM)</strong>. The ultimate hardware root of trust, mirroring the privilege of a hypervisor but strictly for security enforcement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Proprietary Opcodes:</strong><br>
Transitions between worlds are not handled by standard <code>SMC</code> calls. Apple added custom instructions to the ISA:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>GENTER</code> (Opcode <code>0x00201420</code>):</strong> Synchronous entry into the Secure World. It behaves like a hypercall, atomically switching the hardware context (SPRR state, stack pointer, and system registers) from ELx to GLx.</li>
<li><strong><code>GEXIT</code> (Opcode <code>0x00201400</code>):</strong> Returns from the Secure World to the Normal World.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="124-new-in-tahoe-shadow-permission-remapping-registers-sprr">1.2.4 <strong>New in Tahoe:</strong> Shadow Permission Remapping Registers (SPRR)</h4>
<p>To enforce isolation between the Normal World (XNU) and the Secure World (Exclaves), Apple replaced the older APRR (Access Permission Remapping Registers) on newer silicon (A15/M2+) with the more robust <strong>SPRR (Shadow Permission Remapping Registers)</strong>.</p>
<p>In standard Arm MMUs, the Page Table Entry (PTE) bits define permissions directly. In Apple Silicon with SPRR enabled, the PTE's <code>AP[1:0]</code> bits and NX bits (<code>UXN</code>, <code>PXN</code>) are repurposed as a <strong>4-bit index</strong> into a hardware permission table.</p>
<p><strong>The Indirection Layer:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>PTE Index:</strong> The PTE specifies a permission index (e.g., Index 5).</li>
<li><strong>Context Lookup:</strong> The hardware checks the current execution mode (EL2, GL1, or GL2).</li>
<li><strong>Resolution:</strong> It looks up Index 5 in the <code>SPRR_PERM_ELx</code> register specific to that mode.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The Security Implication:</strong><br>
This allows for "View-Based" memory protection.</p>
<ul>
<li>A particular SPRR index (for example, index 5) is configured so that in <strong>GL2 (SPTM)</strong> it resolves to <strong>Read-Write (RW)</strong>.</li>
<li>The same index resolves to <strong>Read-Only (RO)</strong> in <strong>EL2 (Kernel)</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is how the SPTM protects page tables. The physical pages containing the translation tables are marked with a specific SPRR index. The hardware configuration for EL2 (Kernel) maps that index to Read-Only. Even if an attacker has a kernel-level arbitrary write primitive, the MMU will reject the write to the page table because the SPRR configuration for EL2 forbids it. The only way to write to that page is to execute <code>GENTER</code> to switch to GL2, where the SPRR configuration permits the write.</p>
<h2 id="20-the-secure-enclave-processor-sep-the-parallel-computer">2.0 The Secure Enclave Processor (SEP): The Parallel Computer</h2>
<p>If the Application Processor (AP) is the brain of the device, the Secure Enclave Processor (SEP) is its conscience. It is not merely a coprocessor; it is a fully independent computer-on-a-chip, sharing the same die but architecturally severed from the AP. It runs its own operating system (<code>sepOS</code>), based on an Apple-customized L4 microkernel, manages its own peripherals, and holds the keys to the kingdom (UID/GID). In the macOS Tahoe generation, the SEP effectively acts as the root of authority for biometric authentication decisions and for OS-bound key material used in attestation and Data Protection.</p>
<h3 id="21-sep-initialization-boot">2.1 SEP Initialization &amp; Boot</h3>
<p>The SEP boot process is designed to be resilient against a fully compromised Application Processor. From the moment power is applied, the SEP operates under the threat model that the AP is hostile.</p>
<h4 id="211-the-seprom-sram-execution-and-the-memory-protection-engine-mpe">2.1.1 The SEPROM: SRAM Execution and the Memory Protection Engine (MPE)</h4>
<p>Like the AP, the SEP begins execution from an immutable on-die Boot ROM, the <strong>SEPROM</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>The Hardware Environment:</strong><br>
The SEP core (historically an ARMv7-A "Kingfisher" core on A7–A9, though the specific microarchitecture of M-series SEP cores is undocumented) initializes in a highly constrained environment. Execution begins in the SEPROM using a small on-die SRAM for stack and early state. However, the <code>sepOS</code> is too large to fit entirely in SRAM. To utilize the device's main DRAM securely, the SEP relies on the <strong>Memory Protection Engine (MPE)</strong>. Before the SEP accesses external DRAM, the Boot ROM initializes the MPE, ensuring all subsequent memory transactions are encrypted and authenticated. This isolation prevents early-boot DMA attacks from the AP or Thunderbolt peripherals.</p>
<p><strong>The Memory Protection Engine (MPE):</strong><br>
The MPE sits inline between the SEP core and the memory controller. It creates a cryptographic window into physical memory that is opaque to the rest of the SoC.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Ephemeral Keys:</strong> On system startup, the SEP Boot ROM programs the MPE with a random, ephemeral AES key. This key exists only in the MPE hardware registers and is never exposed to software (even <code>sepOS</code>). On M-series silicon, the MPE manages distinct ephemeral keys for the SEP and the Secure Neural Engine (SNE), ensuring isolation even between secure subsystems.</li>
<li><strong>AES-XEX Encryption:</strong> Data written by the SEP to DRAM is encrypted transparently using AES in XEX (XOR-Encrypt-XOR) mode.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication:</strong> The MPE calculates a CMAC tag for every block of memory (cache line granularity). This tag is stored alongside the encrypted data.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>RE Implication:</strong> If you attempt to dump the physical memory range assigned to the SEP from the AP (kernel mode), you will see high-entropy noise. Furthermore, any attempt to modify a single bit of this memory via the AP will invalidate the CMAC tag. The next time the SEP reads that line, the MPE will detect the forgery and trigger a hardware panic, locking down the Enclave until a full system reset.</p>
<h4 id="212-the-boot-monitor-hardware-enforcement-of-os-bound-keys">2.1.2 The Boot Monitor: Hardware Enforcement of OS-Bound Keys</h4>
<p>On modern silicon (A13/M1 and later), Apple introduced the <strong>Secure Enclave Boot Monitor</strong> to mitigate the risk of Boot ROM exploits (like <code>checkm8</code>) compromising the chain of trust for key derivation.</p>
<p>In older architectures, the SEPROM would verify the <code>sepOS</code> signature and then jump to it. If the SEPROM was exploited, the attacker could jump to a malicious payload while retaining access to the hardware UID key. The Boot Monitor closes this gap by enforcing <strong>System Coprocessor Integrity Protection (SCIP)</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>The Boot Flow:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Payload Staging:</strong> The AP (iBoot) loads the <code>sep-firmware.img4</code> payload into a region of physical memory.</li>
<li><strong>Mailbox Signal:</strong> The AP signals the SEP via a hardware mailbox register.</li>
<li><strong>Verification:</strong> The SEPROM parses the Image4 container. It verifies the signature against the SEP-specific Apple Root CA public key embedded within the immutable SEPROM.</li>
<li><strong>The Handoff:</strong> Crucially, the SEPROM <em>cannot</em> simply jump to the loaded image. The SCIP hardware prevents execution of mutable memory.</li>
<li><strong>Monitor Intervention:</strong> The SEPROM invokes the Boot Monitor hardware block.
<ul>
<li>The Monitor <strong>resets</strong> the SEP core to a known clean state.</li>
<li>The Monitor calculates a cryptographic hash of the loaded <code>sepOS</code> memory range.</li>
<li>The Monitor updates the SCIP registers to permit execution of that specific range.</li>
<li>The Boot ROM and Boot Monitor jointly produce a measurement of the loaded <code>sepOS</code> and lock it into a dedicated register used by the Public Key Accelerator (PKA).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>OS-Bound Key Derivation:</strong><br>
This finalized hash is the critical component. When the <code>sepOS</code> later requests keys (e.g., to decrypt user data), the hardware Key Derivation Function (KDF) mixes the hardware UID with this locked hash.</p>
<p>$$ K_{derived} = KDF(UID, Hash_{sepOS}) $$</p>
<p>If an attacker modifies a single byte of the <code>sepOS</code> (even with a Boot ROM exploit), the Boot Monitor calculates a different hash. Consequently, the KDF derives different OS-bound keys, so any data protected by those keys (e.g., passcode- and SKP-bound Data Protection keys) remains cryptographically inaccessible under the modified <code>sepOS</code>. This is "Bound Security"—the data is bound not just to the device, but to a specific, signed software version.</p>
<h4 id="213-anti-replay-mechanisms-the-integrity-tree">2.1.3 Anti-Replay Mechanisms: The Integrity Tree</h4>
<p>A classic attack vector against secure enclaves is the <strong>Replay Attack</strong>: capturing a snapshot of the encrypted RAM (e.g., when the passcode retry counter is 0) and restoring it later after the counter has incremented.</p>
<p>To prevent this, the SEP implements a hardware-enforced <strong>Integrity Tree</strong> (Merkle Tree).</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Root of Trust:</strong> The root node of the integrity tree is stored in <strong>dedicated on-chip SRAM</strong> within the Secure Enclave complex. This memory is physically distinct from the main DRAM and cannot be addressed by the AP.</li>
<li><strong>Tree Structure:</strong> The protected memory region (where <code>sepOS</code> data and the Secure Storage Manager reside) is divided into blocks. Each block's hash is stored in a parent node, recursively up to the root.</li>
<li><strong>Atomic Updates:</strong> When the SEP writes to protected memory (e.g., incrementing a failed attempt counter), the MPE updates the data, recalculates the hashes up the tree, and atomically updates the root hash in the on-chip SRAM.</li>
<li><strong>Verification:</strong> On every read, the MPE verifies the path from the data block up to the SRAM root.</li>
</ol>
<p>If an attacker replays an old DRAM state, the hash of the replayed block will not match the current root hash stored in the internal SRAM. The MPE detects the mismatch (Anti-Replay Violation) and halts the SEP. This mechanism ensures that the SEP has a strictly monotonic view of time and state, rendering snapshot fuzzing and counter rollbacks impossible.</p>
<h3 id="22-sep-runtime-architecture">2.2 SEP Runtime Architecture</h3>
<p>Once the <code>sepOS</code> is bootstrapped and verified, the Secure Enclave transitions into its runtime state. At this point, it functions as a fully autonomous operating system running an Apple-customized variant of the L4 microkernel (historically derived from L4-embedded/Darbat). For the reverse engineer, understanding the runtime architecture is crucial for analyzing how the SEP communicates with the hostile "Rich Execution Environment" (the AP running XNU) and how it persists sensitive state.</p>
<h4 id="221-the-mailbox-interface-analyzing-the-ipc-transport">2.2.1 The Mailbox Interface: Analyzing the IPC Transport</h4>
<p>Communication between the Application Processor (AP) and the SEP is strictly asynchronous and interrupt-driven. Unlike the tight coupling of the SPTM (which uses synchronous instruction traps), the SEP interaction is mediated by a hardware mechanism known as the <strong>Mailbox</strong>, which relies on the proprietary <strong>Apple Interrupt Controller (AIC)</strong> to manage signaling.</p>
<p><strong>The Physical Transport: Registers and Shared Memory</strong><br>
There is no shared virtual memory space; the two processors exchange messages via a combination of Memory-Mapped I/O (MMIO) registers and physical memory buffers.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The Control Mailbox (MMIO):</strong><br>
The primary control channel consists of dedicated hardware registers within the SEP's configuration space (typically mapped at <code>sep@DA00000</code> on A-series, with evolving offsets on M-series).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inbox/Outbox:</strong> The AP writes a message to the <strong>Inbox</strong> register, which triggers an IRQ on the SEP. The SEP writes a reply to the <strong>Outbox</strong> register, which triggers an IRQ on the AP.</li>
<li><strong>M-Series Evolution:</strong> On Apple Silicon (M1+), reverse engineering of the <code>apple-mailbox</code> driver indicates a shift toward using shared memory ring buffers for the control path to handle higher throughput, managed by the AIC's hardware event lines.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Doorbell (Apple Interrupt Controller):</strong><br>
To signal a message, the sender must trigger an exception on the receiver.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AP → SEP:</strong> The kernel writes to a specific AIC "Set" register. This asserts a hardware IRQ line wired to the SEP's core.</li>
<li><strong>SEP → AP:</strong> When the SEP replies, it asserts an IRQ line routed to the AP's AIC. The kernel's interrupt handler (within <code>AppleSEPDriver</code>) acknowledges this by writing to the AIC "Clear" register.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The L4 IPC Protocol:</strong><br>
The data payload passed through the control registers follows a strict, serialized format (often referred to as the <strong>SEP Message</strong> format). Analysis of the <code>AppleA7IOP</code> / <code>AppleSEPManager</code> stack reveals a compact 64-bit structure:</p>
<pre><code>struct sep_msg {
    uint8_t endpoint;  // Destination service (e.g., 0x10)
    uint8_t tag;       // Transaction ID for async correlation
    uint8_t opcode;    // Message type / Command
    uint8_t param;     // Immediate parameter
    uint32_t data;     // Payload or pointer to OOL buffer
};
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>Endpoint ID:</strong> Routes the message to a specific task within <code>sepOS</code> (e.g., the Secure Key Store).</li>
<li><strong>Out-of-Line (OOL) Buffers:</strong> For payloads larger than 32 bits (such as biometric templates or firmware updates), the <code>data</code> field contains a physical address. The AP allocates a physical page, pins it, and passes the address to the SEP. The SEP maps this page into its address space using its own IOMMU (often implemented via <strong>DART</strong> on M-series chips).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>RE Focus: Fuzzing the Boundary</strong><br>
The mailbox is the primary attack surface for the SEP. Vulnerabilities here (parsing malformed messages) can lead to code execution within the Enclave.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Endpoint Fuzzing:</strong> The <code>sepOS</code> kernel dispatches messages to user-mode L4 tasks based on the Endpoint ID. Fuzzing specific endpoints (especially legacy or debug endpoints left enabled in production) is a standard methodology.</li>
<li><strong>Shared Memory Hazards (TOCTOU):</strong> While the mailbox registers handle control flow, bulk data is passed via shared memory. A classic attack vector involves the AP modifying the data in the shared buffer <em>after</em> the SEP has validated the header/signature but <em>before</em> it processes the body (Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="222-the-secure-storage-component-xart-encrypted-persistent-storage">2.2.2 The Secure Storage Component (xART): Encrypted Persistent Storage</h4>
<p>The SEP has no general-purpose NAND flash of its own. It must rely on the Application Processor’s storage stack to persist long-lived secrets (passcode state, biometric templates, token material). However, it cannot <em>trust</em> the AP or its filesystem to store this data without tampering.</p>
<p>To solve this, Apple pairs the SEP with a <strong>Secure Storage Component</strong>, often referred to in firmware and kexts as <strong>xART</strong> (eXtended Anti-Replay Technology).</p>
<p>At a high level, xART behaves as a <strong>dedicated, tamper-resistant non-volatile store</strong> that is <em>logically</em> attached exclusively to the SEP:</p>
<ul>
<li>It has its own non-volatile memory and cryptographic logic.</li>
<li>It is only addressable from within the SEP’s trust domain over a dedicated, authenticated channel.</li>
<li>The AP and XNU have no direct protocol to read or write its contents; all access is mediated by <code>sepOS</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can think of xART as a small, secure NVRAM bank whose sole purpose is to hold anti-replay metadata and counters that anchor SEP-managed state.</p>
<p><strong>The Architecture:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Physical / Logical Separation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>At the implementation level, the Secure Storage Component may be a discrete die or a dedicated block within a larger package, but architecturally it presents as a separate secure store accessed only by the SEP.</li>
<li>The AP sees none of its registers or address space; there are no MMIO ranges that the kernel can map to talk directly to xART.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SEP-Centric View of Storage:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The SEP treats AP-managed NAND (the main SSD / NVMe) as an untrusted block device.</li>
<li>All SEP data structures stored there (keybags, counters, templates, tickets) are encrypted and authenticated using keys derived from the UID/GID and xART’s state.</li>
<li>The xART component holds the small, high-value bits: monotonic counters, per-volume or per-domain nonces, and commitment hashes for larger encrypted blobs stored on the AP’s filesystem.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The Anti-Replay Guarantee:</strong></p>
<p>When the SEP writes persistent state—for example, updating the failed passcode attempt counter or credential state—it performs a two-phase commit:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Write to Untrusted Storage (AP):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The SEP encrypts the payload (e.g., a keybag or metadata record) with keys derived from the UID and appropriate class keys.</li>
<li>It sends the ciphertext to the AP via the mailbox protocol.</li>
<li>The AP writes this to its filesystem (e.g., a file under <code>/private/var/db/</code>), but the contents are opaque to it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Commit to xART (Secure Storage Component):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In parallel, the SEP computes a cryptographic digest (e.g., a hash or MAC) over the new payload and the associated monotonic counter or nonce.</li>
<li>It writes this digest and the updated counter/nonce to xART.</li>
<li>xART becomes the authoritative record of “what the latest version of this object should look like” and “how many times it has been updated.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>On subsequent reads:</p>
<ol>
<li>The SEP requests the ciphertext from the AP.</li>
<li>It recomputes the digest and compares it against the value stored in xART for that object.</li>
<li>If the digests and counters match, the SEP accepts and decrypts the payload.</li>
<li>If the AP has replayed an old copy (e.g., with a lower counter or different hash), the mismatch is detected and the SEP treats it as an <strong>anti-replay violation</strong>—typically halting access to that data or, in severe cases, triggering a lockout.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Security Properties:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Monotonicity:</strong><br>
The SEP’s view of sensitive state (e.g., passcode retry counters, escrow records) is strictly monotonic. An attacker cannot reset or roll back these counters by snapshotting and restoring AP-visible storage, because xART’s internal counters would not match.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>AP Transparency:</strong><br>
From the AP’s perspective, xART is a black box. It sees only that some SEP operation failed or succeeded; it never observes the internal counters, keys, or hashes that xART maintains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Binding:</strong><br>
SEP-managed data is effectively bound to:</p>
<ul>
<li>The specific SEP instance (via UID).</li>
<li>The xART anti-replay state (counters / nonces).</li>
<li>The software measurement (for SKP-like mechanisms described later).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>RE Implication:</strong></p>
<p>For reverse engineering, the important consequences are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dumping or modifying the files that back SEP state on the AP is insufficient to reset security-sensitive conditions (e.g., passcode retry counters, keybag versions). Without aligning xART’s internal state, any replay will be detected and rejected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no direct AP-visible interface to xART; all interesting protocol surface is in:</p>

<h4 id="223-re-focus-reverse-engineering-the-sepos-l4-syscall-table">2.2.3 <strong>RE Focus:</strong> Reverse Engineering the <code>sepOS</code> L4 Syscall Table</h4>
<p>For the advanced reverse engineer, the holy grail is understanding the <code>sepOS</code> kernel itself. Since it is based on L4, it relies heavily on synchronous IPC for system calls.</p>
<p><strong>Identifying the Syscall Handler:</strong><br>
In the disassembled <code>sepOS</code> binary (decrypted via Boot ROM exploit), the exception vector table is the starting point. The <strong>SVC (Supervisor Call)</strong> handler dispatches requests based on the immediate value or a register (typically <code>x0</code> or <code>x8</code>).</p>
<p><strong>Mapping the Tasks:</strong><br>
The <code>sepOS</code> is modular, consisting of the kernel and several user-mode "apps" or "tasks." Analysis of firmware dumps reveals the internal naming convention:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>SEPOS</code>:</strong> The root task and kernel.</li>
<li><strong><code>sks</code> (Secure Key Store):</strong> The backend for <code>AppleSEPKeyStore</code>, managing Data Protection and Keychain items.</li>
<li><strong><code>sbio-sd</code> (Secure Biometric Sensor Driver):</strong> The backend for <code>biometrickitd</code>, handling the processing of fingerprint and face data.</li>
<li><strong><code>sse</code> (Secure Element):</strong> Manages communication with the NFC Secure Element for Apple Pay.</li>
<li><strong><code>sepServices</code>:</strong> A directory service mapping symbolic names to endpoints.</li>
</ul>
<p>By tracing the IPC messages dispatched from the Mailbox handler, you can map which L4 task handles which service. For example, messages routed to the endpoint associated with <code>sbio-sd</code> will contain the proprietary command structures for biometric enrollment and matching. Analyzing the message parsing logic within that specific task reveals the attack surface for biometric bypasses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Tooling Note:</strong> Standard tools like IDA Pro or Ghidra require custom loaders for <code>sepOS</code> binaries. The memory layout is non-standard, and the binary format (Mach-O) often has stripped headers or non-standard segment protections that must be manually reconstructed based on the SCIP configuration found in the Boot Monitor logic.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="30-the-chain-of-trust-firmware-bootloaders">3.0 The Chain of Trust: Firmware &amp; Bootloaders</h2>
<p>With the hardware root of trust established and the Secure Enclave operating as a parallel authority, the Application Processor begins the process of bootstrapping the mutable software stack. This phase is governed by the <strong>Image4</strong> serialization format and a strict chain of cryptographic handover.</p>
<h3 id="31-low-level-bootloader-llb">3.1 Low-Level Bootloader (LLB)</h3>
<p>On platforms that implement an LLB stage (e.g., Apple Silicon Macs and older A-series SoCs), the <strong>Low-Level Bootloader (LLB)</strong> is the first piece of mutable code executed by the Application Processor. Loaded by the Boot ROM from the boot partition of the internal flash (NAND, or NOR SPI on some development hardware), it executes initially out of on-die SRAM before DRAM has been brought online. Its primary directive is architectural: it must bridge the gap between the raw silicon state and the feature-rich environment required by iBoot.</p>
<h3 id="311-parsing-the-image4-img4-container">3.1.1 Parsing the Image4 (<code>img4</code>) Container</h3>
<p>To the reverse engineer, "firmware" on Apple Silicon is synonymous with <strong>Image4</strong>. LLB is not a raw binary; it is encapsulated in an Image4 container, a format based on ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One) and DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules). Understanding this structure is prerequisite to any firmware analysis.</p>
<p>A complete Image4 object consists of an <strong><code>IM4P</code> (Payload)</strong> and an <strong><code>IM4M</code> (Manifest)</strong>, with an optional <strong><code>IM4R</code> (Restore Info)</strong> object used in restore flows.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong><code>IM4P</code> (Payload):</strong> The actual executable code (the LLB binary).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Encryption:</strong> The payload is encrypted under a per-image AES key. On production devices, this per-image key is wrapped using the SoC’s <strong>GID Key</strong> and stored in the <strong>Keybag (KBAG)</strong> tag within the payload. At boot, the hardware AES engine unwraps the KBAG under the GID key to recover the IV and payload key, then decrypts the payload. This means the payload is opaque to external analysis unless decrypted on-device (or via a GID oracle).</li>
<li><strong>Compression:</strong> Once decrypted, the payload is typically compressed (LZSS or LZFSE).</li>
<li><strong>Type Tag:</strong> A 4-character code (e.g., <code>ibot</code>, <code>illb</code>) identifying the component.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>IM4M</code> (Manifest):</strong> The signature and constraints, commonly known as the <strong>ApTicket</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Signature:</strong> An RSA or ECDSA signature over the SHA-384 hash of the payload.</li>
<li><strong>The Body:</strong> A set of entitlements and constraints (tags) that dictate <em>where</em> and <em>how</em> this payload can run.</li>
<li><strong>Certificate Chain:</strong> The manifest includes the certificate chain leading back to the Apple Root CA. The Boot ROM holds the corresponding root public key (or its hash) in immutable hardware and verifies the chain using the <strong>Public Key Accelerator (PKA)</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>IM4R</code> (Restore Info):</strong> (Optional) Contains hardware-specific personalization data used during the restore process, such as the unique nonce generated by the SEP.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The Validation Logic:</strong><br>
When the Boot ROM loads LLB (and when LLB subsequently loads iBoot), it performs the following <code>image4_validate</code> routine:</p>
<ol>
<li>Parse the ASN.1 structure to separate <code>IM4M</code> and <code>IM4P</code>.</li>
<li>Hash the <code>IM4P</code> (ciphertext).</li>
<li>Locate the corresponding hash in the <code>IM4M</code> (under the specific tag, e.g., <code>illb</code>).</li>
<li>Verify the <code>IM4M</code> signature using the PKA.</li>
<li>If valid, the hardware unwraps the payload key from the KBAG using the GID Key, loads it into the AES engine, and decrypts the <code>IM4P</code> ciphertext.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="312-dram-training-and-memory-controller-configuration">3.1.2 DRAM Training and Memory Controller Configuration</h4>
<p>Before external LPDDR4X/LPDDR5 Unified Memory can be used, the memory controller and PHY must be trained. Early boot code (Boot ROM and/or LLB) runs initially from on-die SRAM until DRAM training has converged. The physical characteristics of RAM—signal timing, voltage margins, and skew—vary slightly between every physical device due to manufacturing tolerances.</p>
<p><strong>The Training Sequence:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Reading SPD/Calibration Data:</strong> The boot code reads calibration data from the device tree or dedicated EEPROM areas.</li>
<li><strong>PHY Configuration:</strong> It configures the Physical Layer (PHY) interface of the memory controller.</li>
<li><strong>Training Loop:</strong> The code executes a complex algorithm that writes patterns to DRAM and reads them back, adjusting delay lines (DLLs) and drive strengths until the signal is stable.</li>
<li><strong>Remapping:</strong> Once training is complete, the MCU is brought online. The Memory Management Unit (MMU) is then reconfigured to map the vast expanse of DRAM into the address space.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>RE Implication:</strong><br>
If you are attempting to exploit the Boot ROM or early LLB, you are constrained to SRAM. You cannot load large payloads or use heap spraying techniques that require gigabytes of memory until <em>after</em> the bootloader has successfully trained the DRAM. This creates a "choke point" for early-boot exploits.</p>
<h3 id="313-verifying-the-exclusive-chip-id-ecid-and-board-id">3.1.3 Verifying the Exclusive Chip ID (ECID) and Board ID</h3>
<p>Apple utilizes a mechanism called <strong>Personalization</strong> (or Taming) to prevent firmware replay attacks. You cannot simply take a valid, signed LLB from one iPhone and run it on another, nor can you downgrade to an older, vulnerable LLB version.</p>
<p>This enforcement happens inside the Image4 parser logic within LLB (checking the next stage) and the Boot ROM (checking LLB).</p>
<p><strong>The Constraint Tags:</strong><br>
The <code>IM4M</code> manifest contains specific tags that bind the signature to the hardware:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>ECID</code> (Exclusive Chip ID):</strong> A unique per-SoC identifier fused into the chip and exposed as an integer value used for personalization.</li>
<li><strong><code>BORD</code> (Board ID):</strong> Identifies the PCB model (e.g., <code>0x10</code> for a specific iPhone logic board).</li>
<li><strong><code>CHIP</code> (Chip ID):</strong> Identifies the SoC model (e.g., <code>0x8103</code> for M1).</li>
<li><strong><code>SDOM</code> (Security Domain):</strong> <code>0x1</code> for Production, <code>0x0</code> for Development.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Check:</strong><br>
During boot, the executing code reads the actual values from the hardware fuses and compares them against the values present in the signed <code>IM4M</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>If <code>Hardware.ECID != Manifest.ECID</code>, the boot halts.</li>
<li>If <code>Hardware.BORD != Manifest.BORD</code>, the boot halts.</li>
</ul>
<p>This mechanism, combined with the <strong>Nonce</strong> (a random value generated by the SEP during updates and baked into the <code>IM4M</code>), ensures that the firmware is:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Authentic:</strong> Signed by Apple.</li>
<li><strong>Targeted:</strong> Valid only for <em>this specific device</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Fresh:</strong> Valid only for <em>this specific boot/update cycle</em> (preventing downgrades).</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In the "Tahoe" architecture, reverse engineering suggests this verification logic appears to use redundant checks and bitwise operations that resist simple instruction skipping (e.g., glitching a <code>B.NE</code> instruction).</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="32-iboot-stage-2-bootloader">3.2 iBoot (Stage 2 Bootloader)</h3>
<p>Once LLB has initialized the DRAM and verified the next stage, it hands off execution to <strong>iBoot</strong>. While LLB is a hardware-focused shim, iBoot is a sophisticated, compact operating system in its own right. It features a cooperative task scheduler (rather than a simple single-threaded loop) that manages concurrent subsystems including a full USB stack, a display driver (for the Apple logo), and a filesystem driver (APFS/HFS+). In the Tahoe architecture, iBoot’s role has expanded beyond merely bootstrapping the XNU kernel; it now serves as the orchestrator of the platform's security domains, responsible for loading and isolating the hardware-enforced monitors before the kernel is permitted to execute.</p>
<h4 id="321-the-apple-device-tree-adt">3.2.1 The Apple Device Tree (ADT)</h4>
<p>The hardware configuration of an Apple Silicon device is not discoverable via standard buses like PCI enumeration alone. Instead, iBoot relies on the <strong>Apple Device Tree (ADT)</strong>—a hierarchical binary data structure (conceptually similar to OpenFirmware or Linux Device Trees) that describes the SoC's topology.</p>
<p><strong>The Source:</strong><br>
The raw ADT is either embedded within the iBoot binary or loaded as a separate <code>devicetree.img4</code> payload. It contains nodes describing CPUs, memory maps, interrupt controllers (AIC), and peripherals. Unlike Linux systems which often use a "Flattened Device Tree" (FDT), Apple utilizes its own proprietary binary format for the ADT, which XNU consumes directly via the <code>SecureDTLookup</code> APIs.</p>
<p><strong>Runtime Population (<code>/chosen</code>):</strong><br>
Before jumping to the kernel, iBoot populates the <code>/chosen</code> node of the ADT with critical runtime parameters.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>kaslr-seed</code>:</strong> A high-entropy random value (inferred to be derived from the TRNG). The kernel uses this to randomize its memory slide.</li>
<li><strong><code>memory-map</code>:</strong> A critical array of structures defining physical memory regions. iBoot marks regions used by the Boot ROM, LLB, and itself as reserved, ensuring the kernel does not overwrite them.</li>
<li><strong><code>boot-args</code>:</strong> The command-line arguments passed to the kernel (e.g., <code>debug=0x14e</code>, <code>-v</code>). On production devices, these are strictly filtered based on the <code>sip3</code> flags in LocalPolicy; only specific flags are allowed unless the device is in a specific research or demoted state.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="322-new-in-tahoe-loading-the-security-monitors">3.2.2 <strong>New in Tahoe:</strong> Loading the Security Monitors</h4>
<p>In pre-Tahoe architectures (iOS 14 / macOS 11), iBoot would simply load the kernelcache and jump to it. In the Tahoe era (A15/M2+), iBoot must construct the <strong>Guarded Execution Environment</strong> before the kernel can exist.</p>
<p><strong>Allocation and Reservation:</strong><br>
iBoot parses the device tree to identify physical memory ranges reserved for the new monitors. It carves these out of the available DRAM:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SPTM Region:</strong> Reserved for the Secure Page Table Monitor.</li>
<li><strong>TXM Region:</strong> Reserved for the Trusted Execution Monitor.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Payload Loading:</strong><br>
iBoot locates the specific Image4 payloads, which are co-packaged with the kernelcache (referenced in the OS firmware manifest):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>Ap,SecurePageTableMonitor</code>:</strong> The GL2 binary.</li>
<li><strong><code>Ap,TrustedExecutionMonitor</code>:</strong> The GL1 binary.</li>
</ul>
<p>It decrypts and verifies these payloads just like any other firmware component. However, instead of loading them into standard memory, it loads them into the reserved physical regions identified above.</p>
<p><strong>Locking SPRR Regions (Conceptual View):</strong><br>
This is the critical security pivot. Before handing off control, iBoot establishes the initial <strong>Shadow Permission Remapping Registers (SPRR)</strong> state to enforce isolation. While the SPTM performs its own fine-grained configuration upon initialization, the architectural guarantee provided by iBoot is:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <strong>GL2 (SPTM)</strong> view is configured to have Read/Write/Execute access to its own memory region.</li>
<li>The <strong>GL1 (TXM)</strong> view is configured to have access to its region.</li>
<li>Crucially, the <strong>GL0 (Kernel)</strong> view is configured to mark the SPTM and TXM regions as <strong>Inaccessible (No-Access)</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>This ensures that when the processor eventually drops to EL1 (GL0) to run XNU, the kernel is physically incapable of reading or modifying the monitor code, even though it resides in the same physical DRAM.</p>
<h4 id="323-localpolicy-baa-the-shift-to-local-signing">3.2.3 LocalPolicy &amp; BAA: The Shift to Local Signing</h4>
<p>For macOS, Apple introduced a mechanism to allow users to boot older OS versions or custom kernels (Permissive Security) without breaking the hardware chain of trust. This is managed via <strong>LocalPolicy</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>The Problem:</strong><br>
The Boot ROM and LLB enforce strict signature checks using manifests issued by Apple's global signing server (TSS). These checks are performed offline using embedded root keys. If you want to boot a custom kernel, you cannot obtain a valid signature from Apple's TSS.</p>
<p><strong>The Solution:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>LocalPolicy:</strong> A policy file stored on the Data Volume (in the <code>iSCPreboot</code> volume). It specifies the security mode (Full, Reduced, Permissive) and the hash of the custom kernel collection.</li>
<li><strong>Owner Identity Key (OIK):</strong> When a user authorizes a downgrade or custom boot (via Recovery Mode authentication), they are effectively authorizing the use of a device-specific <strong>Owner Identity Key (OIK)</strong> generated within the Secure Enclave. This key is certified once by Apple's <strong>Basic Attestation Authority (BAA)</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Re-Signing:</strong> The LocalPolicy is signed by the SEP using this OIK.</li>
<li><strong>Boot Time:</strong> iBoot fetches the LocalPolicy. It asks the SEP to verify the signature against the OIK. If the SEP confirms the policy is valid (and matches the user's intent), iBoot proceeds to load the custom kernel hash specified in the policy (enabled via the <code>smb1</code> bit), effectively "blessing" it for this boot cycle.</li>
</ol>
<p>This allows "Permissive Security" to exist while keeping the Boot ROM and LLB strictly locked down to the hardware root of trust.</p>
<h4 id="324-re-focus-decrypting-iboot-payloads-via-the-aes-mmio-interface">3.2.4 <strong>RE Focus:</strong> Decrypting iBoot Payloads via the AES MMIO Interface</h4>
<p>To analyze iBoot, one must decrypt it. Since the GID key is fused into the silicon and physically disconnected from the CPU's register file, it cannot be extracted via software. Reverse engineers must instead turn the device into a <strong>Decryption Oracle</strong> by manipulating the dedicated AES hardware peripheral.</p>
<p><strong>The <code>kbag</code> Mechanism:</strong><br>
The Image4 payload (<code>IM4P</code>) is encrypted with a random, per-file symmetric key (the target key). This target key is wrapped (encrypted) with the GID key and stored in the <code>IM4P</code> header as a <strong>Keybag (<code>kbag</code>)</strong>. To decrypt the firmware, one must unwrap this kbag.</p>
<p><strong>The Hardware Distinction (ISA vs. MMIO):</strong><br>
It is critical to distinguish between the <strong>ARMv8 Crypto Extensions</strong> (instructions like <code>AESE</code>, <code>AESD</code>) and the <strong>Apple AES Peripheral</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ARMv8 Crypto:</strong> Operates on keys loaded into standard NEON/SIMD registers (<code>v0</code>-<code>v31</code>). Useful for TLS or disk encryption where the key is known to the OS.</li>
<li><strong>Apple AES Peripheral:</strong> A memory-mapped I/O (MMIO) block, typically located at a base offset like <code>0x23D2C0000</code> (on M1/T8103) or similar <code>0x2...</code> ranges on newer SoCs. This peripheral has exclusive hardware access to the GID key fuses.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Oracle Exploit:</strong><br>
Using a Boot ROM exploit (like <code>checkm8</code> on A-series) or a specialized iBoot exploit, researchers execute a payload that drives this MMIO interface directly:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Reset:</strong> Reset the AES peripheral via the <code>AES_CTRL</code> register to clear internal state.</li>
<li><strong>Key Selection:</strong> Write to the configuration register to select the <strong>GID Key</strong> as the decryption source. This sets an internal mux; the key itself is never exposed to the bus.</li>
<li><strong>FIFO Loading:</strong> Write the <code>kbag</code> (IV + Ciphertext) into the <code>AES_DATA_IN</code> FIFO registers.</li>
<li><strong>Execution:</strong> Trigger the engine. The hardware pulls the GID key from the fuses, performs the AES-256-CBC unwrap, and pushes the result to the output buffer.</li>
<li><strong>Extraction:</strong> Read the unwrapped target key (typically formatted as <code>iv:key</code>) from the <code>AES_DATA_OUT</code> register.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Hypothesized Countermeasures:</strong><br>
Modern Apple Silicon (A12+/M1+) implements countermeasures against this oracle usage. Reverse engineering suggests the AES engine may enforce a state machine that requires the output of a GID decryption to be immediately DMA'd to executable memory and jumped to, rather than read back into a general-purpose register. Bypassing this theoretically requires <strong>Fault Injection</strong> (voltage glitching) to corrupt the state machine or precise timing attacks to race the hardware's "sanitize on read" logic, allowing the extraction of the plaintext key before the hardware scrubs it.</p>
<h2 id="40-the-security-monitor-layer-gl1gl2-the-exclave-architecture">4.0 The Security Monitor Layer (GL1/GL2): The Exclave Architecture</h2>
<p>In the "Tahoe" architecture, the XNU kernel has been demoted. It no longer possesses the ultimate authority to define the virtual memory layout of the system. That power has been migrated to a hardware-enforced monitor running in a proprietary execution state known as the <strong>Secure World</strong> (specifically, the Guarded Execution Feature or GXF). This section dissects the mechanics of this new layer, which effectively functions as a silicon-enforced hypervisor for the kernel itself.</p>
<h3 id="41-the-secure-page-table-monitor-sptmgl2">4.1 The Secure Page Table Monitor (SPTM) - GL2</h3>
<p>The Secure Page Table Monitor (SPTM) operates at <strong>Guarded Level 2 (GL2)</strong>. It is the highest privilege <strong>runtime</strong> component on the Application Processor, sitting above both the XNU Kernel (EL2) and the Secure Kernel (GL1). The SPTM is the sole entity permitted to write to the physical pages that constitute the translation tables (TTBR0/TTBR1) for the managed domains of both the Normal and Secure worlds.</p>
<h4 id="411-the-genter-and-gexit-instructions-context-switching">4.1.1 The <code>GENTER</code> and <code>GEXIT</code> Instructions: Context Switching</h4>
<p>Transitions into the SPTM utilize the proprietary <code>GENTER</code> instruction, which performs a synchronous, atomic context switch.</p>
<p><strong>The <code>GENTER</code> ABI:</strong><br>
To invoke the SPTM, the kernel populates specific registers and executes the opcode.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Opcode:</strong> <code>0x00201420</code> (Little Endian).</li>
<li><strong><code>x16</code> (Dispatch Target):</strong> The primary control register. It holds the <code>sptm_dispatch_target_t</code>, a 64-bit value encoding the <strong>Domain</strong> (e.g., XNU, TXM, SK), the <strong>Dispatch Table ID</strong>, and the <strong>Endpoint ID</strong> (function index).</li>
<li><strong><code>x0</code> - <code>x7</code> (Arguments):</strong> The parameters for the call (e.g., physical addresses, permission flags). <code>x0</code> is often reserved for the thread stack pointer when relaying calls to the TXM.</li>
<li><strong>Immediate Value:</strong> The 5-bit immediate encoded in the <code>GENTER</code> instruction itself serves as an entry index, selecting the specific GXF entry stub (recorded in <code>ESR_GLx</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Hardware Transition:</strong><br>
Upon execution of <code>GENTER</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>World Switch:</strong> The hardware traps to GL2.</li>
<li><strong>SPRR Switch:</strong> The hardware swaps the active Shadow Permission Remapping Register configuration. The memory regions containing the SPTM code and data—previously invisible to the kernel—become Read/Write/Execute.</li>
<li><strong>Stack Switch:</strong> The Stack Pointer (<code>SP</code>) is switched to the <code>SP_GL2</code> register, pointing to a dedicated secure stack within the SPTM's private memory.</li>
<li><strong>PC Jump:</strong> Execution jumps to the vector defined in <code>GXF_ENTRY_EL2</code> (or equivalent GL2 vector base).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The Return:</strong><br>
The SPTM returns control to the kernel using <code>GEXIT</code> (<code>0x00201400</code>). This restores the EL2 SPRR configuration and the kernel's stack pointer. Crucially, on the return path, the SPTM and TXM scrub their per-thread state and shared buffers before executing <code>GEXIT</code>, ensuring that sensitive GL-only data is not left in registers or shared pages exposed to the kernel.</p>
<h4 id="412-the-frame-table-fte-tracking-physical-reality">4.1.2 The Frame Table (FTE): Tracking Physical Reality</h4>
<p>To enforce security, the SPTM cannot rely on the kernel's data structures (like <code>vm_page_t</code>), as they are mutable by a compromised kernel. Instead, the SPTM maintains its own "God View" of physical memory called the <strong>Frame Table</strong>.</p>
<p>The Frame Table is a linear array of <strong>Frame Table Entries (FTE)</strong>, located in SPTM-private memory. There is one FTE for every 16KB page of physical RAM (matching the kernel's translation granule).</p>
<p><strong>FTE Structure and Domains:</strong><br>
The FTE tracks the state of every physical page, enforcing strict ownership by <strong>SPTM Domains</strong> (<code>sptm_domain_t</code>). While the internal enum values evolve, the conceptual types include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>XNU_DATA</code> (XNU Domain):</strong> Generic kernel heap/stack.</li>
<li><strong><code>XNU_TEXT</code> (XNU Domain):</strong> Immutable kernel code.</li>
<li><strong><code>PAGE_TABLE</code> (SPTM Domain):</strong> A page containing translation entries (TTEs).</li>
<li><strong><code>EXCLAVE_DATA</code> (SK Domain):</strong> Memory owned by the Secure World.</li>
<li><strong><code>SPTM_PRIVATE</code> (SPTM Domain):</strong> Internal monitor structures.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Security Invariant:</strong><br>
The SPTM enforces that a physical page can only be mapped into a virtual address space if the mapping permissions are compatible with the page's Type and Domain. For example, a page marked <code>XNU_DATA</code> cannot be mapped as Executable. A page marked <code>PAGE_TABLE</code> cannot be mapped as Writable by the kernel.</p>
<h4 id="413-the-dispatch-table-reverse-engineering-the-selectors">4.1.3 The Dispatch Table: Reverse Engineering the Selectors</h4>
<p>The interface between XNU and the SPTM is a strict, register-based API. However, unlike the stable syscall numbers of the BSD layer, the <strong>SPTM Dispatch IDs</strong> are not guaranteed to remain static across macOS versions. Apple frequently rotates these IDs to frustrate static analysis tools.</p>
<p><strong>The ABI:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>x16</code></strong>: The <code>sptm_dispatch_target_t</code> (Domain + Table + Endpoint).</li>
<li><strong><code>x0</code> - <code>x7</code></strong>: Arguments (Physical Addresses, Permission Bitmasks, ASIDs).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Heuristic Identification:</strong><br>
Since relying on static IDs is brittle, reverse engineers must fingerprint the <em>logic</em> of the handler functions within the <code>Ap,SecurePageTableMonitor</code> binary to identify the primitives.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><code>sptm_retype(ppn, old_type, new_type)</code></strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Fingerprint:</em> Look for a function that accepts a Physical Page Number (PPN), reads the corresponding Frame Table Entry (FTE), and performs a <strong>Sanitization Loop</strong>. The SPTM must zero-fill (<code>bzero</code>) or cache-invalidate the page before transitioning it from <code>XNU_DATA</code> to <code>PAGE_TABLE</code> to prevent the kernel from initializing a page table with pre-computed malicious entries.</li>
<li><em>Logic:</em> <code>assert(refcount == 0); memset(pa, 0, PAGE_SIZE); fte-&gt;type = new_type;</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>sptm_map(asid, va, ppn, perms)</code></strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Fingerprint:</em> Look for a function that walks the translation tables (reading physical memory) and performs a <strong>Permission Check</strong> against the FTE. It will contain logic that explicitly compares the requested <code>perms</code> (e.g., Write) against the <code>fte-&gt;type</code> (e.g., <code>XNU_TEXT</code>).</li>
<li><em>Logic:</em> <code>if (fte-&gt;type == XNU_TEXT &amp;&amp; (perms &amp; WRITE)) panic(); write_tte(...);</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>sptm_unmap(asid, va)</code></strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Fingerprint:</em> Look for the <strong>TLB Invalidation</strong> sequence. For SPTM-controlled mappings, TLB invalidation is performed inside GL2 as part of the unmap routine. XNU cannot directly update those page tables and must invoke SPTM to perform any changes, including the corresponding TLB maintenance (<code>TLBI ALLE2IS</code> or similar).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>sptm_map_iommu(dart_id, context_id, dva, ppn, perms)</code></strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Fingerprint:</em> Look for writes to MMIO regions associated with DART controllers, rather than standard RAM. This function validates that the <code>ppn</code> is not a protected kernel page before mapping it into a device's IOVA space.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>RE Implication:</strong><br>
Automated analysis scripts should not rely on <code>CMP x15, #0x1</code>. Instead, they should symbolically execute the <code>GENTER</code> handler in the SPTM binary, identifying the dispatch table jump via <code>x16</code>, and then classify the target functions based on the presence of <code>DC ZVA</code> (cache zero), <code>TLBI</code>, or FTE array access patterns.</p>
<h4 id="414-re-focus-analyzing-panic-strings-and-the-state-machine">4.1.4 <strong>RE Focus:</strong> Analyzing Panic Strings and the State Machine</h4>
<p>The SPTM is designed to be <strong>Fail-Secure</strong>. Unlike standard kernel APIs that return <code>KERN_FAILURE</code>, the SPTM treats invalid requests as evidence of kernel compromise.</p>
<p><strong>The Panic Mechanism:</strong><br>
If XNU sends a malformed request (e.g., trying to retype a page that is still mapped), the SPTM returns a fatal error code. XNU, upon receiving this error, triggers a system-wide panic.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Panic String:</strong> <code>"received fatal error for a selector from TXM"</code> or <code>"invalid state transition"</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Analysis:</strong> These strings are gold for reverse engineers. They confirm that the SPTM enforces a strict <strong>Finite State Machine (FSM)</strong> for memory pages.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mapping the State Machine:</strong><br>
By analyzing the panic logic and the allowed transition bitmaps, we can deduce the allowed transitions:</p>

<li><code>FREE</code> → <code>XNU_DATA</code> (Allocation)</li>
<li><code>XNU_DATA</code> → <code>PAGE_TABLE</code> (Retype for MMU use - requires sanitization)</li>
<li><code>PAGE_TABLE</code> → <code>XNU_DATA</code> (Teardown - requires unmapping all entries)</li>
<li><code>XNU_DATA</code> → <code>XNU_TEXT</code> (KEXT loading - One-way transition!)</li>
</ol>
<p>Any attempt to deviate from this graph (e.g., trying to turn <code>PAGE_TABLE</code> directly into <code>XNU_TEXT</code>) results in an immediate halt. This prevents "Page Table Spraying" and other heap manipulation techniques used to gain kernel execution.</p>
<h3 id="42-the-trusted-execution-monitor-txm-%E2%80%93-gl0">4.2 The Trusted Execution Monitor (TXM) – GL0</h3>
<p>If the SPTM is the brawn—enforcing the physics of memory mapping—the <strong>Trusted Execution Monitor (TXM)</strong> is the brains. Operating as a privileged Conclave at <strong>Guarded Level 0 (GL0)</strong>, the TXM is the supreme arbiter of system policy. It represents the architectural decoupling of “mechanism” from “policy.” While the SPTM handles <em>how</em> a page is mapped, the TXM decides <em>if</em> it is allowed to be mapped executable under a given policy.</p>
<h4 id="421-decoupling-amfi-moving-core-code-signature-verification">4.2.1 Decoupling AMFI: Moving Core Code-Signature Verification</h4>
<p>Historically, the <strong>Apple Mobile File Integrity (AMFI)</strong> kernel extension was the primary enforcement point for code signing. While AMFI still exists to handle complex userland policy checks, in the Tahoe architecture the core cryptographic verification logic for <strong>platform and protected code</strong> has been lifted out of the kernel and placed into the TXM. TXM’s primary currency of trust is the <strong>Code Directory Hash (CDHash)</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>The Verification Flow (conceptual):</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Load &amp; Hash:</strong> The kernel (XNU) loads a binary into memory (typed as <code>XNU_DATA</code>). It parses the <code>LC_CODE_SIGNATURE</code> load command and calculates the CDHash (typically SHA-256 over the Code Directory).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Query:</strong> XNU issues a call into the Secure World. The Secure Kernel (GL1) routes this to the TXM (GL0). The kernel passes the CDHash and the physical address range that will back the executable mapping.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Trust Cache Lookup:</strong> The TXM consults its internal <strong>Trust Caches</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Static Trust Cache:</strong> CDHashes for immutable OS binaries (kernel collections, dyld shared cache, system daemons shipped in Cryptexes).</li>
<li><strong>Loadable / Dynamic Trust Caches:</strong> CDHashes for binaries that have been verified previously (third-party apps, JIT regions, auxiliary trust caches).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cold Validation:</strong> On a <strong>cache miss</strong>, the system enters a “cold path”. The kernel, often assisted by <code>amfid</code> and <code>syspolicyd</code>, provides the CMS signature blob and certificate chain for the image. TXM performs the cryptographic verification against the relevant Apple root (or Developer ID root) inside the guarded world. On success, the CDHash is inserted into an appropriate trust cache.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Blessing:</strong> Once the CDHash is validated according to platform policy, TXM updates its internal state so that the specific physical pages associated with that CDHash are marked as “permitted for execution” when requested with appropriate permissions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enforcement via SPTM:</strong> When XNU later asks the SPTM to map those pages as Executable (<code>RX</code>), the SPTM consults TXM (or the trust-cache state driven by TXM). If the pages are not in a state that policy allows to become executable, the SPTM denies the Execute permission, even if EL2 code tries to set it in the PTE.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Platform distinction (iOS-class vs macOS):</strong></p>
<p>The exact <em>policy</em> enforced by TXM/SPTM is platform-dependent:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>On <strong>iOS / iPadOS / watchOS / visionOS</strong>, TXM + SPTM implement a hard invariant: only code that is both correctly signed and policy-approved is allowed to become executable. AMFI’s view of “signed or not” is no longer sufficient on its own; the SPTM must agree.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On <strong>macOS</strong>, the platform is explicitly designed to allow arbitrary and ad-hoc user code to run. In that environment:</p>
<ul>
<li>TXM still verifies and tracks <strong>platform binaries</strong> (kernel collections, system frameworks, hardened system daemons) and other code that participates in the system integrity story (e.g. components running with special entitlements or under hardened runtime).</li>
<li>SPTM still mediates executable mappings and protects the integrity of page tables and immutable kernel/monitor regions.</li>
<li>However, the global “no unsigned code ever executes” property is <strong>not</strong> applied to general userland on macOS. The set of mappings that SPTM/TXM treat as “must be verified” is narrower and aligned with Apple’s documented policy distinction between macOS and fully locked-down platforms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>RE Implication:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>On <strong>iOS-class platforms</strong>, patching the kernel to ignore AMFI errors is no longer a sufficient route to arbitrary unsigned code execution: the SPTM/TXM stack must still bless the mapping. Attempts to create executable mappings for code that TXM has not accepted will fail at the SPTM boundary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On <strong>macOS</strong>, a kernel compromise can still influence which user binaries run (for example, by weakening or bypassing Gatekeeper and AMFI checks for user processes), and ad-hoc binaries remain architecturally admissible. The SPTM/TXM stack primarily constrains:</p>
<ul>
<li>the integrity of page tables and KIP/KTRR-like regions,</li>
<li>the mappings of kernel collections and other protected code, and</li>
<li>the ability of a compromised kernel to subvert those invariants.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In all cases, SPTM continues to arbitrate frame typing and protected mappings above EL2. TXM’s policy decisions define which code is <em>eligible</em> for protection and execution under a given mode; SPTM enforces the resulting invariants in the page-table and DART hardware.</p>
<h4 id="422-the-trust-cache-static-vs-loadable">4.2.2 The Trust Cache: Static vs. Loadable</h4>
<p>To avoid the performance penalty of cryptographic verification on every page fault, the TXM manages the <strong>Trust Cache</strong>—a database of known-good CDHashes.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The Static Trust Cache:</strong><br>
This is loaded by iBoot and passed to the TXM during the Secure World initialization. It contains the hashes of every binary in the OS (now encapsulated in the immutable <strong>Cryptexes</strong>). This cache resides in Secure World memory and is strictly Read-Only.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Loadable Trust Caches:</strong><br>
These handle third-party applications, JIT regions, and auxiliary updates. When a user launches an app, the TXM verifies the signature once and adds the CDHash to a loadable cache.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Query Interface:</strong> The kernel queries the Trust Cache via a specific <code>GENTER</code> selector.</li>
<li><strong>Attack Surface:</strong> These caches are mutable structures managed by the TXM. A logic bug in the TXM's management of this cache (e.g., a race condition during entry removal or a hash collision attack) is a high-value target for persistence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="423-developer-mode-enforcement-and-downgrade-protection">4.2.3 Developer Mode Enforcement and Downgrade Protection</h4>
<p>The TXM is also the guardian of the device's security posture, specifically <strong>Developer Mode</strong>.</p>
<p>In previous iterations, enabling debugging capabilities was often a matter of setting <code>nvram</code> variables or <code>boot-args</code> (like <code>cs_enforcement_disable=1</code>). In Tahoe, these states are managed by the TXM.</p>
<p><strong>The State Transition:</strong><br>
Enabling Developer Mode requires a reboot and explicit user authorization (Secure Intent via physical buttons). The TXM persists this state (likely via the Secure Enclave's secure storage).</p>
<p><strong>Downgrade Protection:</strong><br>
The TXM enforces that the system cannot transition from a "Production" state to a "Developer" state without a full reboot and authentication ceremony. This prevents a kernel-level attacker from dynamically relaxing security policies to load unsigned modules.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the <strong>LocalPolicy</strong> (signed by the SEP) encodes whether the system is in Full, Reduced, or Permissive Security. Early-boot components (LLB/iBoot) will refuse to start macOS without a valid LocalPolicy, preventing silent downgrades of security policy. At runtime, the TXM consults this configuration when deciding which code-signing and trust-cache policies to enforce.</p>
<h2 id="50-xnu-kernel-initialization-entering-el2">5.0 XNU Kernel Initialization: Entering EL2</h2>
<p>The handoff from iBoot to the XNU kernel marks the transition from a single-threaded bootloader to a symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) operating system. However, in the Tahoe architecture, this is no longer a handover of absolute power. On modern macOS configurations (where XNU typically executes at <strong>Exception Level 2 (EL2)</strong> using Virtualization Host Extensions), the kernel enters not as a master, but as a client of the <strong>Guarded Level 2 (GL2)</strong> monitor.</p>
<p>The entry point is defined in <code>osfmk/arm64/start.s</code>. At this precise moment, the system state is fragile: the MMU is operating under a minimal bootstrap mapping provided by iBoot (or disabled entirely depending on the specific SoC generation), interrupts are masked (<code>DAIF</code> bits set), and the stack pointer is essentially arbitrary. The kernel's first objective is to orient itself within physical memory, calculate the KASLR slide, and establish the virtual memory structures required to turn on the lights.</p>
<h3 id="51-the-start-routine-and-kaslr">5.1 The <code>start</code> routine and KASLR</h3>
<p>The <code>_start</code> symbol is the architectural entry point. Unlike x86_64, where the kernel might handle its own decompression and relocation, the Apple Silicon kernel is loaded as a raw Mach-O executable (within the <code>kernelcache</code> container) directly into physical memory by iBoot.</p>
<p><strong>The Register State at Entry:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>CurrentEL</code></strong>: Indicates EL2 (on standard macOS Tahoe configurations).</li>
<li><strong><code>x0</code></strong>: Physical address of the <code>boot_args</code> structure (version 2).</li>
<li><strong><code>x1</code></strong>: Physical address of the Device Tree base (if not inside <code>boot_args</code>).</li>
<li><strong><code>x2</code></strong>: 0 (Reserved/Empirically observed).</li>
<li><strong><code>x3</code></strong>: 0 (Reserved/Empirically observed).</li>
<li><strong><code>sp</code></strong>: Invalid/Temporary.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="511-deriving-the-kernel-slide-the-decoupled-address-space">5.1.1 Deriving the Kernel Slide: The Decoupled Address Space</h4>
<p>Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (KASLR) on Apple Silicon is a cooperative effort between iBoot and XNU. iBoot generates a high-entropy value from the TRNG, populates the <code>/chosen/kaslr-seed</code> property in the Device Tree, and physically relocates the kernel text in DRAM to match this slide.</p>
<p><strong>The <code>boot_args</code> Structure:</strong><br>
Upon entry at <code>_start</code>, the kernel immediately parses the <code>boot_args</code> structure pointed to by <code>x0</code>. This structure acts as the handover manifest, containing:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>virtBase</code></strong>: The <em>runtime</em> virtual base address where the kernel is mapped (i.e., the static base plus the slide).</li>
<li><strong><code>physBase</code></strong>: The actual physical load address in DRAM.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Slide Calculation:</strong><br>
The kernel calculates its own slide by comparing the runtime virtual base provided by iBoot against its compile-time static base:</p>
<p>$$ \texttt{vm\_kernel\_slide} = \texttt{boot\_args.virtBase} - \texttt{STATIC\_KERNEL\_BASE} $$</p>
<p><strong>The Tahoe Constraint: Address Space Decoupling:</strong><br>
In the Tahoe architecture, the system operates under a paradigm of <strong>Address Space Decoupling</strong>. The SPTM (GL2) and the Kernel (EL2) reside in the same physical DRAM but operate in distinct translation regimes.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Kernel View:</strong> The kernel runs under <code>TTBR1_EL2</code> (or <code>TTBR1_EL1</code> with VHE), with a virtual layout randomized by <code>kaslr-seed</code>.</li>
<li><strong>SPTM View:</strong> The SPTM runs under the <strong>GL2</strong> translation regime with its own independent set of translation table base registers.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Security Implication:</strong><br>
This separation is critical. A kernel-level memory leak (e.g., an <code>infoleak</code> revealing a kernel pointer) allows an attacker to calculate <code>vm_kernel_slide</code>. In previous architectures, if the monitor (PPL) was mapped at a fixed offset relative to the kernel, a kernel leak would instantly reveal the monitor's location.</p>
<p>In Tahoe, knowing <code>vm_kernel_slide</code> yields <strong>zero information</strong> about the virtual address of the SPTM. The SPTM's virtual mapping is established by iBoot in the GL2 context before the kernel executes. While the kernel is aware of the SPTM's <em>physical</em> pages (marked as "Reserved" in the memory map), it is architecturally blind to the SPTM's <em>virtual</em> location.</p>
<p><strong>RE Focus: Finding the Slide:</strong><br>
For a reverse engineer with a kernel panic log or a JTAG connection, identifying these slides requires inspecting distinct registers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Kernel Slide:</strong> Inspect <code>TTBR1_EL2</code> (or <code>TTBR1_EL1</code> if VHE is active). The translation table base points to the physical location of the kernel's L1 table. The high bits of the PC (Program Counter) at the exception vector reveal the virtual slide.</li>
<li><strong>SPTM Slide:</strong> This is invisible from EL2. To find it, one must inspect the GL2-specific TTBRs via JTAG while the core is halted in the GL2 context.</li>
<li><strong>Static Analysis:</strong> The <code>vm_kernel_slide</code> global variable in XNU is one of the first initialized. In a raw memory dump, locating the <code>boot_args</code> struct (often at the start of a physical page aligned to 16KB) will reveal the <code>virtBase</code> directly.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="512-initializing-the-mmu-tcrel2-and-the-sptm-handshake">5.1.2 Initializing the MMU: <code>TCR_EL2</code> and the SPTM Handshake</h4>
<p>Before the kernel can execute C code safely, it must enable the Memory Management Unit (MMU). On standard ARMv8, this involves populating translation tables and writing to <code>TTBR0</code> and <code>TTBR1</code>, then setting <code>SCTLR.M</code>.</p>
<p>On Tahoe, this process is fundamentally altered because <strong>the kernel cannot write to its own page tables.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bootstrap Problem:</strong><br>
How does the kernel build its initial page tables if it requires the SPTM to map pages, but the SPTM requires the kernel to make hypercalls?</p>
<p><strong>The Solution: The Bootstrap Tables:</strong><br>
iBoot installs a minimal set of <strong>Bootstrap Page Tables</strong> before handing off control. These tables typically contain identity mappings for the PC and stack, allowing the kernel to execute the initialization code required to bring up the SPTM interface.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>TCR_EL2 Setup:</strong> The kernel configures the <strong>Translation Control Register (<code>TCR_EL2</code>)</strong>.
<ul>
<li><strong><code>T1SZ</code> / <code>T0SZ</code>:</strong> Defines the size of the virtual address space (typically 48-bit on macOS).</li>
<li><strong><code>TG1</code>:</strong> Granule size (16KB is standard for Apple Silicon).</li>
<li><strong><code>IPS</code>:</strong> Intermediate Physical Address Size (matches the SoC capability, e.g., 40 bits).</li>
<li><strong><code>TBI</code> (Top Byte Ignore):</strong> Typically configured to allow the top byte (bits 63-56) to carry metadata (such as PAC signatures or tags) without affecting address translation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The SPTM Handshake (The First <code>GENTER</code>):</strong><br>
Once <code>TCR_EL2</code> is configured, the kernel must transition from the iBoot-provided bootstrap tables to its own managed tables.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Allocation:</strong> The kernel allocates physical pages for the new L1/L2/L3 translation tables from the <code>XNU_DATA</code> pool.</li>
<li><strong>Sanitization:</strong> The kernel zeroes these pages.</li>
<li><strong>Retype:</strong> The kernel executes <code>GENTER</code> (Selector <code>0x01</code> - <code>sptm_retype</code>) to convert these pages from <code>XNU_DATA</code> to <code>PAGE_TABLE</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Mapping:</strong> The kernel executes <code>GENTER</code> (Selector <code>0x02</code> - <code>sptm_map</code>) to populate the entries, replicating the kernel text and static data mappings.</li>
<li><strong>Activation:</strong> Finally, the kernel programs the appropriate <code>TTBR1</code> (EL1 or EL2 depending on configuration) to point to the new L1 table. The SPTM constrains the actual effect via SPRR/GXF.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The <code>SCTLR_EL2</code> Lockdown:</strong><br>
The final step of <code>start</code> is writing to the <strong>System Control Register (<code>SCTLR_EL2</code>)</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>M</code> (MMU Enable):</strong> Set to 1.</li>
<li><strong><code>C</code> (Cache Enable):</strong> Set to 1.</li>
<li><strong><code>WXN</code> (Write-XOR-Execute):</strong> Set to 1.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Tahoe, writes to <code>SCTLR_EL2</code> are mediated by GL2/SPTM (via GXF’s control over system registers). GL2 enforces that configurations keep <code>WXN</code> set, preventing EL2 from creating writable-executable mappings even if compromised. If the kernel attempts to disable <code>WXN</code>, the SPTM rejects the configuration and panics the device.</p>
<p>Once the MMU is active and the kernel is running on its own page tables (managed by SPTM), the <code>start</code> routine branches to <code>arm_init</code>, beginning the high-level initialization of the BSD subsystem and IOKit.</p>
<h3 id="52-hardware-security-enforcements-the-kill-switch-registers">5.2 Hardware Security Enforcements (The "Kill Switch" Registers)</h3>
<p>As the kernel initialization sequence progresses through <code>start</code>, it reaches a critical inflection point. The memory management structures are initialized, and the kernel is about to transition from a setup phase to a runtime phase. To prevent a compromised runtime kernel from modifying its own logic, the initialization routine must engage the hardware "Kill Switches."</p>
<p>In the Tahoe architecture, this protection is layered: <strong>KTRR</strong> provides the physical baseline, <strong>KIP</strong> defines the boot-time immutable regions, and the <strong>SPTM</strong> virtualizes and extends these concepts to enforce dynamic immutability.</p>
<h4 id="521-ktrr-kernel-text-read-only-region-the-physical-lock">5.2.1 KTRR (Kernel Text Read-Only Region): The Physical Lock</h4>
<p><strong>Kernel Text Read-Only Region (KTRR)</strong> is Apple’s hardware solution to the "W^X" (Write XOR Execute) problem at the physical memory controller level. While the MMU (via page tables) controls virtual access permissions, page tables are mutable data structures. KTRR enforces read-only permissions for a physical range corresponding to kernel text, below the level of page tables. Even if an attacker can mutate PTEs, writes into the KTRR physical region are blocked or faulted.</p>
<p><strong>The Register Interface:</strong><br>
KTRR is controlled via a set of proprietary system registers, typically accessible via <code>MSR</code> instructions.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>KTRR_LOWER_EL1</code> (<code>S3_4_c15_c2_3</code>):</strong> Defines the physical start address of the protected range.</li>
<li><strong><code>KTRR_UPPER_EL1</code> (<code>S3_4_c15_c2_4</code>):</strong> Defines the physical end address.</li>
<li><strong><code>KTRR_LOCK_EL1</code> (<code>S3_4_c15_c2_2</code>):</strong> The kill switch. Writing <code>1</code> to the lock bit enables the protection.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Tahoe Evolution (Virtualization of KTRR):</strong><br>
On M3/M4 chips running the SPTM, the kernel's interaction with KTRR changes. It is highly probable that the SPTM virtualizes these registers using GXF traps. When XNU executes the legacy instructions to write to <code>KTRR_LOWER/UPPER</code> in <code>start</code>, the hardware traps these accesses to GL2. The SPTM validates that the kernel is attempting to cover the correct physical range and enforces its own policy, effectively mocking the success of the operation to the kernel while ensuring the hardware is locked down.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>RE Focus: The KTRR Slide Alignment</strong><br>
Because KTRR operates on physical ranges with large granularity (e.g., 1MB or L2 cache line boundaries), the KASLR slide is forced to align to this granularity. If you are brute-forcing the KASLR slide, knowing the KTRR alignment constraint significantly reduces the entropy search space.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="522-kernel-integrity-protection-kip-and-sptm-sealing">5.2.2 Kernel Integrity Protection (KIP) and SPTM Sealing</h4>
<p>KTRR protects the static kernel binary (<code>kernelcache</code>). However, modern macOS relies heavily on the <strong>Boot Kernel Collection (BKC)</strong> and <strong>Auxiliary Kernel Collection (AKC)</strong>—large caches of drivers and extensions loaded during boot.</p>
<p><strong>Hardware KIP:</strong><br>
Apple documentation refers to <strong>Kernel Integrity Protection (KIP)</strong> as a hardware feature where the memory controller defines a protected region into which iBoot loads the kernel and kernel extensions, then denies writes after boot. This serves as the static anchor for the BKC.</p>
<p><strong>SPTM Dynamic Sealing (<code>XNU_TEXT</code>):</strong><br>
The SPTM generalizes this concept to support dynamic loading. Unlike static KTRR/KIP regions, the SPTM maintains a <strong>Frame Table</strong> where pages can be typed.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Registration:</strong> During <code>start</code>, the kernel links and relocates extensions.</li>
<li><strong>Sealing:</strong> The kernel issues a <code>GENTER</code> call (Selector <code>sptm_retype</code> or <code>sptm_protect</code>) to "seal" the region.</li>
<li><strong>Retyping:</strong> The SPTM updates the Frame Table Entries (FTE) for the physical pages backing the drivers, transitioning them from <code>XNU_DATA</code> (Writable) to <code>XNU_TEXT</code> (Executable/Read-Only).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The "One-Way" Door:</strong><br>
The security invariant enforced here is that memory typed as <code>XNU_TEXT</code> is <strong>never</strong> writable by EL2. If the kernel attempts to write to a sealed page, the <strong>SPRR</strong> configuration for EL2 triggers a permission fault. This effectively turns the kernel extensions into ROM, mitigating rootkits that historically operated by patching IOKit vtables in memory.</p>
<h4 id="523-the-system-control-register-sctlrel2-lockdown">5.2.3 The System Control Register (<code>SCTLR_EL2</code>) Lockdown</h4>
<p>The final "Kill Switch" is the configuration of the ARM processor itself. The <code>SCTLR_EL2</code> register controls the MMU, caches, and alignment checks.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Bits:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>WXN</code> (Write-XOR-Execute):</strong> Bit 19. When set, any memory region mapped as Writable is implicitly treated as Non-Executable (<code>XN</code>).</li>
<li><strong><code>M</code> (MMU Enable):</strong> Bit 0.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Trap-and-Emulate Policy:</strong><br>
In a standard ARM system, EL2 can modify <code>SCTLR_EL2</code> at will. In the Tahoe architecture, writes to <code>SCTLR_EL2</code> are mediated by GL2/SPTM via GXF’s control over system registers. The effective policy under normal operation is that <strong><code>WXN</code> remains set</strong>: GL2/SPTM will not accept configurations that clear <code>WXN</code> to create writable–executable regions. If the kernel attempts to program <code>SCTLR_EL2</code> with <code>WXN</code> cleared, the requested configuration is rejected by the monitor and, in current implementations, this manifests as a system panic rather than a silent relaxation of protections. This ensures that the fundamental security properties of the execution environment (in particular W^X) cannot be disabled, even by a compromised kernel.</p>
<h3 id="53-exclaves-the-microkernel-within-the-monolith">5.3 Exclaves: The Microkernel within the Monolith</h3>
<p>The introduction of <strong>Exclaves</strong> in the Tahoe architecture represents the most profound structural change to the Apple OS ecosystem since the transition from Mac OS 9 to OS X. It is an admission that the monolithic kernel architecture (XNU) has become too large, too complex, and too mutable to serve as the ultimate Trusted Computing Base (TCB) for high-value assets.</p>
<p>Exclaves introduce a <strong>Microkernel architecture</strong> running side-by-side with the monolithic XNU kernel on the same Application Processor cores. Unlike the Secure Enclave (which is a separate coprocessor), Exclaves harness the full performance of the M-series cores while maintaining cryptographic isolation enforced by the SPTM.</p>
<h4 id="531-the-l4-influence-domains-conclaves-and-ipc">5.3.1 The L4 Influence: Domains, Conclaves, and IPC</h4>
<p>The architecture of the Exclave system is heavily indebted to the <strong>L4 microkernel</strong> family. It prioritizes minimalism, capability-based security, and strict isolation.</p>
<p><strong>The Hierarchy of Isolation:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Secure Kernel (<code>ExclaveOS</code>):</strong> A tiny, formally verifiable kernel that manages scheduling and IPC within the secure world. It runs at <strong>GL1</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Domains:</strong> The highest level of separation. The "Insecure Domain" hosts XNU and userland (EL2/EL0). The "Secure Domain" hosts Exclave workloads.</li>
<li><strong>Conclaves:</strong> Within the Secure Domain (GL0), workloads are siloed into <strong>Conclaves</strong>. A Conclave is a lightweight container consisting of an address space, a set of capabilities (handles to resources), and threads.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Memory Management via SPTM:</strong><br>
The isolation is enforced by the SPTM's Frame Table. Physical pages assigned to an Exclave are typed in the FTE (likely as <code>EXCLAVE_DATA</code> or <code>SK_DATA</code>). The kernel sees these physical pages as "reserved" in the device tree. Any attempt by XNU to map these pages via <code>sptm_map</code> will result in a panic, as the SPTM forbids mapping Exclave-owned pages into the <code>XNU_DOMAIN</code>.</p>
<h4 id="532-re-focus-the-ringgate-mechanism-and-xnuproxy">5.3.2 <strong>RE Focus:</strong> The <code>RingGate</code> Mechanism and <code>XNUProxy</code></h4>
<p>For the reverse engineer, the critical question is: <em>How does the Kernel talk to an Exclave?</em> They share no virtual memory, run in different hardware contexts, and the SPTM actively prevents XNU from mapping Exclave physical pages. The bridge is a mechanism internally referred to by researchers as <strong>RingGate</strong>, facilitated by a component named <code>XNUProxy</code>.</p>
<p><strong>The Communication Stack:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Tightbeam (The IDL):</strong><br>
Apple has introduced a new Interface Definition Language (IDL) called <strong>Tightbeam</strong>. It replaces the legacy Mach Interface Generator (MIG) for secure world communication. Tightbeam is strongly typed and buffer-centric.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Userland Analysis:</strong> The serialization logic is visible in <code>/usr/lib/libTightbeam.dylib</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Kernel Analysis:</strong> <code>XNUProxy</code> appears both as an XNU-side component and as related services in the secure world, bridging Mach ports to Exclave endpoints.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Downcall (XNU → Exclave):</strong><br>
When XNU needs a service, it cannot call the function directly.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Marshaling:</strong> <code>XNUProxy</code> serializes the request using Tightbeam into a shared memory ring buffer.</li>
<li><strong>The Gate:</strong> The kernel executes a specific instruction to trigger the world switch. This is a <code>GENTER</code> instruction targeting a specific Dispatch ID reserved for the Secure Kernel.</li>
<li><strong>Context Switch:</strong> The hardware (mediated by SPTM) saves the EL2 state, switches the SPRR configuration to the Exclave view, and jumps to the <code>ExclaveOS</code> entry point (GL1).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Upcall (Exclave → XNU):</strong><br>
Exclaves rely on XNU for file system I/O or networking.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Exclave writes a request to the outbound ring buffer.</li>
<li>It triggers an interrupt or executes a <code>GEXIT</code> yield.</li>
<li><code>XNUProxy</code> receives the notification, reads the request, performs the operation via standard VFS calls, and returns the result via a Downcall.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Memory Loaning (The "DART" Window):</strong><br>
While control messages go through ring buffers, large data transfers occur via <strong>Memory Loaning</strong>. <code>XNUProxy</code> pins a userland page and passes its physical address to the Exclave via Tightbeam. The Exclave requests the SPTM to map this specific PPN into its address space. This "Loaned Memory" mechanism is a prime target for <strong>TOCTOU (Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use)</strong> attacks, as the ownership transitions are complex and mediated by the SPTM state machine.</p>
<h4 id="533-use-case-secure-control-of-privacy-indicators-and-passkeys">5.3.3 Use Case: Secure Control of Privacy Indicators and Passkeys</h4>
<p>The "Killer App" for Exclaves in macOS Tahoe is the hardware-enforced privacy indicator (the green/orange dots).</p>
<p>Reverse engineering of current macOS Tahoe builds strongly suggests that these indicators are implemented using an Exclave-controlled overlay path along the following lines:</p>
<p><strong>The Tahoe Solution:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Hardware Ownership:</strong> The physical framebuffer region corresponding to the status bar indicators is, in current implementations, <strong>not mapped</strong> in the XNU domain. It appears to be owned exclusively by a specific <strong>Privacy Conclave</strong> (GL0), so that only secure-world code can directly address the pixels used for the indicators.</li>
<li><strong>The DART Lock:</strong> The Display Coprocessor's IOMMU (DART) is configured under SPTM control such that the main display pipe used by XNU and WindowServer cannot write to the indicator pixels. Only a secure overlay pipe, controlled by the Exclave domain, is allowed to source scanout data for that region.</li>
<li><strong>Immutability:</strong> Under this design, XNU cannot map the physical memory backing the secure overlay, and it cannot reconfigure the relevant DART contexts without going through SPTM policy. As a result, a compromised kernel is effectively unable to erase or suppress the indicator once the secure pipeline has decided it should be visible.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Passkeys and FIDO:</strong><br>
Similarly, passkey operations are increasingly implemented inside Exclave-backed services.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key Isolation:</strong> The key material for Passkeys is generated and stored in hardware-isolated domains (SEP plus, on newer platforms, Exclave-backed services), with XNU only ever handling opaque identifiers or tokens rather than raw private keys.</li>
<li><strong>Isolation:</strong> Even if malware injects code into the <code>LocalAuthentication</code> daemon or the kernel, it cannot extract the private key material, because it resides in a memory domain that the Normal World cannot directly address.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="60-the-mach-subsystem-the-nervous-system">6.0 The Mach Subsystem: The Nervous System</h2>
<p>While the SPTM and Exclaves represent the new fortress walls of the Apple Silicon architecture, the <strong>Mach</strong> subsystem remains the internal nervous system that coordinates activity within the XNU kernel. Originating from the NeXTSTEP era, Mach provides the fundamental primitives for Inter-Process Communication (IPC), thread scheduling, and virtual memory management.</p>
<p>For the reverse engineer, Mach is the primary vector for local privilege escalation (LPE). Despite decades of hardening, the complexity of state management in Mach messaging remains a fertile ground for logic bugs, race conditions, and reference counting errors. In the Tahoe era, Mach has been retrofitted with heavy PAC enforcement to protect its object graph.</p>
<h3 id="61-mach-ports-ipc-primitives">6.1 Mach Ports &amp; IPC Primitives</h3>
<p>At the conceptual level, Mach is an object-oriented kernel. The fundamental unit of addressing is the <strong>Mach Port</strong>. To a userland process, a port is merely a 32-bit integer handle (<code>mach_port_name_t</code>). To the kernel, it is a complex, reference-counted data structure (<code>ipc_port</code>) that acts as a unidirectional communication channel.</p>
<h4 id="611-port-rights-receive-send-send-once-and-dead-names">6.1.1 Port Rights: Receive, Send, Send-Once, and Dead Names</h4>
<p>The security model of Mach is capability-based. Possessing a port name is meaningless without the associated <strong>Port Right</strong>. The kernel tracks these rights in the process's IPC space.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>MACH_PORT_RIGHT_RECEIVE</code>:</strong> The ownership right. Only one task can hold the Receive right for a specific port at any given time. This task is the destination for messages sent to the port.
<ul>
<li><em>Kernel Structure:</em> The <code>ipc_port</code> struct contains a pointer (<code>ip_receiver</code>) to the <code>ipc_space</code> of the task holding this right.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><code>MACH_PORT_RIGHT_SEND</code>:</strong> The ability to queue messages into the port. Multiple tasks can hold send rights to the same port. This is the standard "client" handle.</li>
<li><strong><code>MACH_PORT_RIGHT_SEND_ONCE</code>:</strong> A "fire-and-forget" right that vanishes after a single message is sent. This is critical for the Request/Reply pattern (RPC). When a client sends a message, it typically includes a <code>MAKE_SEND_ONCE</code> right to its own reply port. The server uses this to send exactly one reply, preventing the server from spamming the client later.</li>
<li><strong><code>MACH_PORT_RIGHT_DEAD_NAME</code>:</strong> If the task holding the Receive right dies or destroys the port, all outstanding Send rights in other tasks are instantly transmuted into Dead Names. Any attempt to send a message to a dead name returns <code>MACH_SEND_INVALID_DEST</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>RE Focus: The <code>ipc_port</code> Structure and PAC:</strong><br>
In previous generations, a common exploit technique involved "Fake Ports"—spraying the heap with crafted data that looked like an <code>ipc_port</code> struct and then tricking the kernel into using it.</p>
<p>In the arm64e/Tahoe architecture, the <code>ipc_port</code> structure is heavily fortified:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><code>ip_object</code>:</strong> The base header of the port.</li>
<li><strong><code>ip_kobject</code>:</strong> A pointer to the underlying kernel object (e.g., a task, a thread, or a user-client). <strong>This pointer is PAC-signed.</strong></li>
<li><strong><code>ip_context</code>:</strong> A 64-bit context value, also PAC-signed.</li>
</ol>
<p>If an attacker attempts to forge a port, they must generate a valid signature for the <code>ip_kobject</code> pointer. Without the <code>APDAKey</code> (Data Key A), the kernel will panic upon <code>AUT</code> execution during message delivery.</p>
<h4 id="612-the-ipc-space-ipcspace-and-the-global-name-server">6.1.2 The IPC Space (<code>ipc_space</code>) and the Global Name Server</h4>
<p>Every task (process) in macOS has an associated <strong>IPC Space</strong> (<code>ipc_space</code>). This structure acts as the translation layer between userland integer handles (<code>mach_port_name_t</code>) and kernel objects (<code>ipc_port *</code>, <code>ipc_pset *</code>, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>The Translation Table (<code>is_table</code>):</strong><br>
Each IPC space is backed by a dynamically sized array of <strong>IPC Entries</strong> (<code>ipc_entry</code>), commonly referred to as the <code>is_table</code> / <code>ipc_entry_table</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Index:</strong><br>
The userland handle (e.g. <code>0x103</code>) encodes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>low-order index</strong> into the <code>is_table</code>, and</li>
<li><strong>High-order generation bits</strong> used to detect stale handles.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Entry (<code>ipc_entry</code>):</strong><br>
Each entry contains (simplified):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>ie_object</code>: A pointer to the underlying <code>ipc_port</code> or <code>ipc_pset</code>. On arm64e/Tahoe, this pointer is protected with pointer authentication (PAC) so that corruption of the raw bits does not yield a usable kernel pointer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ie_bits</code>: A bitfield encoding:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rights (send, receive, send-once, etc.).</li>
<li>The generation count for that slot.</li>
<li>Additional flags (e.g. dead-name state).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Lookup Process (<code>ipc_right_lookup_write</code>):</strong><br>
When a thread executes <code>mach_msg()</code> to send to some <code>msgh_remote_port</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The kernel retrieves the current task’s IPC space:<br>
<code>ipc_space_t space = current_task()-&gt;itk_space;</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It decodes the <code>mach_port_name_t</code> to obtain the index and generation and indexes into <code>space-&gt;is_table</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It checks <code>ie_bits</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generation matches the high bits of the name?</li>
<li>Required right present (e.g. <code>MACH_PORT_RIGHT_SEND</code> for a send).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>On arm64e, it authenticates the <code>ie_object</code> pointer using the appropriate kernel PAC key and context.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If all checks succeed, it obtains the <code>ipc_port</code> and proceeds with message delivery.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This indirection is what allows the kernel to revoke or recycle ports while making stale userland handles harmless: the generation mismatch will cause lookups to fail instead of returning the wrong object.</p>
<p><strong>The Global Name Server:</strong><br>
Mach itself does <strong>not</strong> implement a string-based global namespace in the kernel. The kernel only knows about ports and rights; it does not know what <code>"com.apple.windowserver"</code> means.</p>
<p>The mapping from <strong>string service names → <code>mach_port_t</code></strong> is implemented entirely in userland by the <strong>bootstrap server</strong>, which on macOS is <code>launchd</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Special ports:</strong><br>
The kernel does maintain a small set of “special ports” on host and task objects. Relevant here:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>HOST_PORT</code>: A send right representing the host (<code>realhost</code>).</li>
<li><code>HOST_PRIV_PORT</code>: The privileged host port (see Section 6.2).</li>
<li><code>TASK_BOOTSTRAP_PORT</code>: The task’s handle to the bootstrap server (typically a port managed by <code>launchd</code> for that task’s domain).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When a process calls:</p>
<pre><code>bootstrap_look_up(bootstrap_port, "com.apple.foo", &amp;service_port);
</code></pre>
<p>or uses the XPC equivalent, it is really sending a Mach message to whatever port is stored in its <code>TASK_BOOTSTRAP_PORT</code> slot. <code>launchd</code> receives that message and resolves <code>"com.apple.foo"</code> into a Mach port according to its internal job graph and policy.</p>
<h4 id="613-copy-on-write-cow-optimizations-in-out-of-line-ool-message-passing">6.1.3 Copy-on-Write (CoW) optimizations in Out-of-Line (OOL) message passing</h4>
<p>Mach messages are not limited to small scalars. They can transfer massive amounts of data using <strong>Out-of-Line (OOL)</strong> descriptors. This mechanism relies on Virtual Memory (VM) tricks rather than data copying, making it highly efficient but historically dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>The Mechanism:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Sender:</strong> Includes a <code>mach_msg_ool_descriptor_t</code> in the message, pointing to a buffer in its address space (e.g., 100MB of data).</li>
<li><strong>Kernel Processing:</strong> The kernel does <em>not</em> copy the 100MB. Instead, it walks the sender's VM map.</li>
<li><strong>Copy-on-Write (CoW):</strong> The kernel marks the physical pages backing that buffer as <strong>Read-Only</strong> in the sender's map.</li>
<li><strong>Receiver:</strong> The kernel maps those <em>same physical pages</em> into the receiver's address space, also as <strong>Read-Only</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Faulting:</strong> If either the sender or receiver tries to write to the buffer, the MMU triggers a fault. The kernel catches this, allocates a new physical page, copies the data, and updates the mapping for the writer. This preserves the illusion of a copy.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The Tahoe/SPTM Intersection:</strong><br>
In the Tahoe architecture, this VM manipulation is complicated by the SPTM.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Permission Downgrade:</strong> When the kernel marks the pages as CoW (Read-Only), it cannot simply update the PTEs. It must issue a <code>GENTER</code> call (<code>sptm_protect</code> or <code>sptm_map</code>) to the SPTM to downgrade the permissions of the physical pages in the sender's address space.</li>
<li><strong>The Vulnerability Class:</strong> This complexity introduces a race window. If the kernel logic fails to correctly lock the VM map object before requesting the SPTM update, or if the SPTM state machine has a logic flaw regarding shared pages (<code>refcount &gt; 1</code>), it might be possible to modify the physical page <em>after</em> the message has been "sent" but before the receiver reads it. This is known as a <strong>Double Fetch</strong> or <strong>Physically-Backed-Virtually-Disjoint</strong> attack.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>RE Focus:</strong><br>
Analyze <code>vm_map_copyin</code> and <code>vm_map_copyout</code> in the XNU source (or binary). Look for how <code>vm_map_entry</code> structures are flagged with <code>needs_copy</code> and how these flags translate into SPTM calls. The interaction between Mach IPC (which assumes it controls VM) and the SPTM (which actually controls VM) is the friction point where new bugs will likely emerge.</p>
<h3 id="62-the-hostpriv-port">6.2 The <code>host_priv</code> Port</h3>
<p>In the lexicon of XNU exploitation, the <strong>Host Privilege Port</strong> (<code>host_priv</code>) has historically been synonymous with “Game Over.” It is <strong>not</strong> the kernel task port itself; rather, it is a privileged Mach port on the global <strong>host object</strong> (<code>realhost</code>) that unlocks host-level operations and special ports. In older exploitation chains, <code>host_priv</code> was often the stepping stone to obtain a send right to <code>kernel_task</code> (TFP0) via interfaces such as <code>host_get_special_port</code> or <code>task_for_pid(0, …)</code>.</p>
<h4 id="621-the-%E2%80%9Cgod-mode%E2%80%9D-handle-generation-and-restriction">6.2.1 The “God Mode” Handle: Generation and Restriction</h4>
<p>The <code>host_priv</code> port is backed by the kernel’s global <strong>host object</strong> (<code>realhost</code>). Unlike a task port, which maps to a <code>task_t</code>, the <code>host_priv</code> port is a privileged view of the host object that unlocks host-level operations (for example, access to special ports and certain system configuration controls).</p>
<p><strong>Generation at boot</strong></p>
<p>During early bootstrap in <code>osfmk/kern/host.c</code>, XNU initializes the host subsystem:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong><code>host_init()</code>:</strong><br>
Allocates and initializes the <code>realhost</code> structure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Port allocation:</strong><br>
Calls <code>ipc_port_alloc_kernel()</code> (or equivalent helpers) to create the Mach port for the host.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Kobject association:</strong><br>
Associates the <code>realhost</code> pointer with the port’s <code>ip_kobject</code> / context fields.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>On arm64e/Tahoe:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>ip_kobject</code> (or related kobject pointer) is stored as a <strong>PAC-signed kernel pointer</strong>, using one of the kernel’s data-pointer keys with the port address (or similar) as context.</li>
<li>This prevents simple “write some other kernel address into <code>ip_kobject</code>” attacks, even given a raw kernel read/write primitive: tampered pointers will not authenticate when used.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Distribution</strong></p>
<p>The system is conservative about who gets <code>host_priv</code>. Typical holders are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><code>kernel_task</code>:</strong><br>
Owns the receive right for the host-privileged port.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Privileged daemons (for example, <code>launchd</code>, <code>kernelmanagerd</code>):</strong><br>
Obtain send rights to <code>host_priv</code> via <code>host_get_host_priv_port()</code> or the special-port mechanism, so they can:</p>
<ul>
<li>manage special ports (<code>host_get_special_port</code>, <code>host_set_special_port</code>), and</li>
<li>perform host-level operations on behalf of the rest of the system.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The exact set of daemons that receive <code>host_priv</code> can vary by OS release, but it is a very small, explicitly entitled group.</p>
<p><strong>The “TFP0” chain in Tahoe</strong></p>
<p>Historically, a common pattern was:</p>
<pre><code>host_get_host_priv_port(mach_host_self(), &amp;host_priv);
task_for_pid(mach_task_self(), 0, &amp;kernel_task_port);
</code></pre>
<p>On modern macOS / Tahoe, several layers weaken this chain:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong><code>task_conversion_eval</code> and SIP:</strong><br>
Even if a caller presents <code>host_priv</code>, <code>task_for_pid(0, …)</code> is gated by <strong>System Integrity Protection (SIP)</strong> and related policy hooks. With SIP enabled, conversion to <code>kernel_task</code> is denied for untrusted callers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Immutable kernel regions via KIP/SPTM:</strong><br>
Even if an attacker somehow:</p>
<ul>
<li>bypasses SIP/task conversion checks, and</li>
<li>obtains a <code>kernel_task</code> port,</li>
</ul>
<p>the system’s integrity protections still constrain what that port can do safely:</p>
<ul>
<li>code pages in the <strong>Kernel Integrity Protection (KIP)</strong> region are loaded and marked read-only by iBoot/SPTM,</li>
<li>page tables and “data-const” regions are protected by SPTM frame typing,</li>
<li>attempts to use <code>vm_write</code> / <code>mach_vm_write</code> to modify such protected regions can trigger integrity violations and system panic rather than giving persistent arbitrary code execution.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In effect, on Tahoe-era systems, <code>host_priv</code> is a <strong>high-leverage control primitive</strong> and a prerequisite for a number of powerful operations, but it is no longer, by itself, a trivial “write-anywhere in kernel text” primitive once KIP/SPTM and SIP are taken into account.</p>
<h4 id="622-task-special-ports-the-privileged-directory">6.2.2 Task Special Ports: The Privileged Directory</h4>
<p>While <code>host_priv</code> itself is restricted, it is also the gateway into a table of <strong>host special ports</strong> that act as privileged entry points for various subsystems. These ports are accessed via <code>host_get_special_port()</code> and <code>host_set_special_port()</code>.</p>
<p>Internally, the <code>realhost</code> structure maintains an array such as:</p>
<pre><code>ipc_port_t special[HOST_MAX_SPECIAL_PORT + 1];
</code></pre>
<p>where specific indices are reserved for particular subsystems.</p>
<p><strong>Critical special ports (by name)</strong></p>
<p>A non-exhaustive set of important host special ports:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><code>HOST_AUTOMOUNTD_PORT</code>:</strong><br>
Port used by the kernel to talk to the automounter (<code>automountd</code>) to initiate filesystem mounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>HOST_SEATBELT_PORT</code>:</strong><br>
Control port for the sandbox subsystem (<code>seatbelt</code> / <code>sandbox.kext</code>). Possession of this port gives a daemon the ability to receive sandbox configuration and policy messages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>HOST_KEXTD_PORT</code>:</strong><br>
Port used for communicating with the kernel extension manager (<code>kextd</code> / <code>kernelmanagerd</code>). Historically has been involved in flows that could be abused to force loading of kexts; on Tahoe, these flows are constrained by driver signing, KCs, and TXM/LocalPolicy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>HOST_AMFID_PORT</code>:</strong><br>
Port used to talk to the Apple Mobile File Integrity daemon (<code>amfid</code>) for code-signing validation requests.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The actual numeric IDs (indices into <code>special[]</code>) for these ports are defined in headers like <code>host_special_ports.h</code> and are <strong>not</strong> simple small integers like 1 or 7; they are offsets from <code>HOST_MAX_SPECIAL_KERNEL_PORT</code>. For most reverse-engineering and exploitation work, the symbolic names and behaviors matter more than the concrete index values.</p>
<p><strong>RE Focus: The <code>host_set_special_port</code> trap</strong></p>
<p>A classic post-exploitation idea is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Overwrite a host special port (e.g. the KEXTD port) with a port you control, so you can intercept kernel upcalls intended for that subsystem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In principle:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If an attacker can get <code>host_priv</code> and then call:</p>
<pre><code>host_set_special_port(host_priv,
                      HOST_KEXTD_PORT,
                      attacker_port);
</code></pre>
<p>the kernel will now send all “kextd” notifications to <code>attacker_port</code> instead.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Mitigations in modern macOS include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Entitlement and policy gating:</strong><br>
<code>host_set_special_port</code> is restricted:</p>
<ul>
<li>It requires a host-privileged port.</li>
<li>It is further gated by entitlements and code-signing checks; in practice, only <code>launchd</code> and a very small number of highly privileged system daemons are allowed to call it successfully.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Confused-deputy / race hardening:</strong><br>
Attackers therefore look for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bugs that allow racing or bypassing entitlement checks.</li>
<li>Confused-deputy situations where a daemon that <em>does</em> have the entitlement can be coerced into calling <code>host_set_special_port</code> with an attacker-controlled port name.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>From a reversing perspective, mapping which daemons hold both <code>host_priv</code> and the relevant private entitlements is a critical part of understanding the real attack surface around <code>host_set_special_port</code>.</p>
<h4 id="623-re-focus-fuzzing-mach-message-parsing-mig">6.2.3 <strong>RE Focus:</strong> Fuzzing Mach Message Parsing (MIG)</h4>
<p>Since <code>host_priv</code> exposes a wide attack surface via the Mach IPC interface, it is a primary target for fuzzing. The kernel handles these messages using the <strong>Mach Interface Generator (MIG)</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>The <code>host_priv_server</code> Routine:</strong><br>
When a message is sent to <code>host_priv</code>, the kernel's IPC dispatcher calls <code>host_priv_server</code>. This is an auto-generated function that deserializes the Mach message and dispatches it to the implementation (e.g., <code>kern_host.c</code>).</p>
<p><strong>Vulnerability Classes in MIG:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Type Confusion:</strong> MIG relies on the message header to define the size and type of arguments. If the userland client sends a malformed message (e.g., claiming a descriptor is OOL memory when it is actually inline data), the kernel's unmarshaling logic might misinterpret the data, leading to heap corruption.</li>
<li><strong>Reference Counting Leaks:</strong> If a MIG routine returns an error (e.g., <code>KERN_INVALID_ARGUMENT</code>) <em>after</em> it has incremented the reference count on a port or VM object but <em>before</em> it consumes it, the object leaks. In the kernel, this can lead to a refcount overflow (though 64-bit refcounts make this hard) or a Use-After-Free if the cleanup logic is flawed.</li>
<li><strong>TOCTOU on OOL Memory:</strong> As discussed in Section 6.1.3, if the message includes Out-of-Line memory, the kernel maps it Copy-on-Write. If the MIG handler verifies the content of the memory and then uses it later, the userland process might be able to race the kernel and modify the physical page (via a side-channel or SPTM state confusion) between the check and the use.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The Tahoe Hardening:</strong><br>
In the Tahoe kernel, MIG-generated code has been hardened with <strong>PAC</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Function Pointers:</strong> The dispatch tables used by <code>host_priv_server</code> are signed.</li>
<li><strong>Context:</strong> The <code>ipc_kmsg</code> structure (representing the message in flight) is heavily protected to prevent modification of the message contents after validation but before processing.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, logic bugs in the <em>implementation</em> of the host calls (the C functions called by MIG) remain reachable. For example, <code>host_processor_set_priv</code> allows manipulating CPU sets. If the logic fails to account for a processor being in a low-power state or being managed by an Exclave, it could trigger an inconsistent state in the scheduler.</p>
<h2 id="70-iokit-driver-architecture">7.0 IOKit &amp; Driver Architecture</h2>
<p>While the Mach subsystem provides the primitives for IPC and scheduling, <strong>IOKit</strong> provides the object-oriented framework for device drivers. Historically, IOKit has been the "soft underbelly" of the XNU kernel. Written in a restricted subset of C++, it relies heavily on virtual function dispatch, complex inheritance hierarchies, and manual reference counting (<code>OSObject::retain</code>/<code>release</code>).</p>
<p>In the Tahoe architecture, IOKit has undergone a radical hardening process. The transition to Apple Silicon has allowed Apple to enforce strict Control Flow Integrity (CFI) on C++ objects using PAC, while <strong>Kernel Integrity Protection (KIP)</strong> enforces the immutability of the driver code itself, with the <strong>SPTM</strong> protecting the page tables that describe those regions.</p>
<h3 id="71-iokit-initialization">7.1 IOKit Initialization</h3>
<p>The initialization of IOKit is the bridge between the static hardware description provided by iBoot (the Device Tree) and the dynamic, runtime object graph that constitutes the macOS driver environment.</p>
<h4 id="711-the-ioregistry-populating-the-device-tree-into-c-objects">7.1.1 The IORegistry: Populating the Device Tree into C++ Objects</h4>
<p>When the kernel boots, the hardware topology is described by the Flattened Device Tree (FDT). Unlike previous architectures where the FDT pointer might have been passed in a raw register, in the current XNU ABI, the FDT pointer is stored in the <code>deviceTreeP</code> field of the <code>boot_args</code> structure, which is passed in <code>x0</code> to the kernel entry point <code>_start</code>. IOKit's first major task is to hydrate this binary blob into a live graph of <code>IORegistryEntry</code> objects.</p>
<p><strong>The <code>IOPlatformExpert</code>:</strong><br>
The bootstrap process is driven by the <code>IOPlatformExpert</code> class (specifically <code>IOPlatformExpertDevice</code> on Apple Silicon).</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Unflattening:</strong> The kernel parses the FDT. For every node in the tree (e.g., <code>arm-io</code>, <code>uart0</code>, <code>aic</code>), it instantiates an <code>IORegistryEntry</code>.</li>
<li><strong>The <code>IODeviceTree</code> Plane:</strong> These objects are attached to the <code>IODeviceTree</code> plane of the Registry. This plane represents the physical topology as reported by iBoot.</li>
<li><strong>Property Mapping:</strong> Properties from the FDT (like <code>reg</code>, <code>interrupts</code>, <code>compatible</code>) are converted into <code>OSData</code>, <code>OSString</code>, or <code>OSNumber</code> objects and attached to the registry entries.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Matching and Driver Loading:</strong><br>
Once the Registry is populated, IOKit begins the <strong>Matching</strong> phase (<code>IOService::startMatching</code>).</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The <code>compatible</code> String:</strong> IOKit iterates over the registry entries. It compares the <code>compatible</code> property (e.g., <code>apple,s5l8960x-uart</code>) against the <code>IOKitPersonalities</code> dictionary defined in the <code>Info.plist</code> of every loaded driver.</li>
<li><strong>The Probe/Start Lifecycle:</strong> When a match is found, the driver's C++ class is instantiated.
<ul>
<li><code>init()</code>: Constructor.</li>
<li><code>probe()</code>: The driver verifies the hardware is actually present (rarely used on SoCs where hardware is static).</li>
<li><code>start()</code>: The driver initializes the hardware, maps MMIO regions, and registers interrupts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>RE Focus: The "Missing" Hardware:</strong><br>
On Tahoe systems, empirical observation reveals gaps in the IORegistry compared to the raw Device Tree.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reserved Regions:</strong> The SPTM and TXM reserve specific hardware blocks (e.g., the Secure Storage controller or specific GPIO banks for privacy LEDs).</li>
<li><strong>Filtering:</strong> While not explicitly documented as an SPTM feature, reverse engineering suggests that during the unflattening process, nodes corresponding to physical ranges reserved by the SPTM are omitted from the <code>IODeviceTree</code>. This effectively makes secure hardware invisible to the OS, preventing the kernel from even attempting to map the MMIO registers for these protected blocks.</li>

<p><strong>Linkage:</strong><br>
All included kexts are prelinked against the kernel:</p>

<li>Symbol resolution is performed at build-time.</li>
<li>No relocations or link-edit work is needed in the early boot path.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Protection (KIP/SPTM):</strong><br>
The BKC is loaded by iBoot into a region managed by <strong>Kernel Integrity Protection (KIP)</strong> and the Secure Page Table Monitor (SPTM):</p>
<ul>
<li>The physical pages backing BKC code are tracked and locked down before XNU runs.</li>
<li>Page-table entries mapping these frames are subject to SPTM policy: kernel attempts to make them writable or executable in unexpected ways can be blocked or cause a panic.</li>

<h4 id="713-re-focus-pac-signing-of-c-vtables-osobject-and-blraa">7.1.3 <strong>RE Focus:</strong> PAC-signing of C++ Vtables (<code>OSObject</code>) and <code>BLRAA</code></h4>
<p>The <code>OSObject</code> class is the root of the IOKit inheritance hierarchy. In C++, dynamic dispatch is handled via <strong>Virtual Tables (vtables)</strong>—arrays of function pointers. Historically, attackers would overwrite the vtable pointer in an object to point to a fake vtable controlled by the attacker (vtable hijacking).</p>
<p>In the arm64e architecture, Apple has fundamentally altered the C++ ABI for kernel code to mitigate this.</p>
<p><strong>The Signed Vtable Pointer:</strong><br>
In a standard C++ object, the first 8 bytes are the pointer to the vtable. In XNU on arm64e, this pointer is <strong>signed</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key:</strong> <code>APDAKey</code> (Data Key A).</li>
<li><strong>Context:</strong> Public Apple documentation states the salt is 0. However, implementations often use address-based salts to achieve diversity.<br>
$$ \texttt{SignedPtr} = \texttt{PAC}(\texttt{VtableAddr}, \texttt{Key=APDA}, \texttt{Context}=0) $$</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Signed Vtable Entries:</strong><br>
The function pointers <em>inside</em> the vtable are signed using the <code>APIAKey</code> (Instruction Key A).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Context:</strong> The salt incorporates the entry's storage address and a hash of the mangled method name. This prevents moving entries between vtables.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The <code>BLRAA</code> Dispatch:</strong><br>
When the kernel calls a virtual function (e.g., <code>object-&gt;release()</code>), the compiler emits a specialized instruction sequence:</p>
<pre><code>LDR     x0, [x20]       ; Load the object pointer
LDR     x16, [x0]       ; Load the signed vtable pointer
AUTDA   x16, xzr        ; Authenticate Data Key A, Context = 0 (per docs)
LDR     x10, [x16, #0x18] ; Load the target function pointer from the vtable
BLRAA   x10, x16        ; Branch with Link, Authenticating Key A, Context = Vtable Address
</code></pre>
<p>Note the two-stage authentication:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><code>AUTDA</code>:</strong> Authenticates that the vtable pointer is valid. If the pointer was overwritten, <code>x16</code> becomes a canonical non-valid pointer.</li>
<li><strong><code>BLRAA</code>:</strong> The function pointers <em>inside</em> the vtable are also signed. The <code>BLRAA</code> instruction authenticates the function pointer (using the vtable address as context) and branches.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The "Recursive" PAC:</strong><br>
This creates a chain of trust:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Object trusts the Vtable Pointer (via <code>APDAKey</code>).</li>
<li>The Vtable trusts the Function Pointers (via <code>APIAKey</code>).</li>
<li>KIP/SPTM trusts the Vtable Memory (via code immutability).</li>
</ul>
<p>For a reverse engineer, this means that patching a vtable in memory is impossible (KIP/SPTM), and forging an object requires the ability to sign pointers with the <code>APDAKey</code>—a capability that requires a "Signing Oracle" gadget, which BTI aims to eliminate.</p>
<h3 id="72-driverkit-dexts">7.2 DriverKit (dexts)</h3>
<p>The introduction of DriverKit represents a strategic retreat for the XNU kernel. For decades, the kernel’s attack surface was effectively the sum of the core kernel plus every third-party driver loaded into the address space. A vulnerability in a Wacom tablet driver or a USB-to-Serial adapter was functionally identical to a vulnerability in the scheduler: both yielded <code>EL1</code> code execution.</p>
<p>DriverKit bifurcates this model by moving hardware drivers into userland, executing as <strong>System Extensions (<code>.dext</code>)</strong>. While they look and feel like drivers to the developer (using a C++ subset similar to Embedded C++), architecturally they are unprivileged processes. In the Tahoe architecture, this isolation is not merely a sandbox; it is a hardware-enforced chasm guarded by the TXM and SPTM.</p>
<h4 id="721-moving-drivers-to-userland-iouserclient-and-entitlement-checks">7.2.1 Moving drivers to userland: <code>IOUserClient</code> and Entitlement Checks</h4>
<p>A <code>dext</code> is an ordinary userland process (usually running as root but confined by a dedicated sandbox and entitlements). It has no direct access to the kernel’s task port and can only exercise kernel functionality via <code>IOUserClient</code> interfaces that the kernel explicitly exposes.</p>
<p><strong>The <code>IOUserServer</code> Proxy:</strong><br>
When a <code>dext</code> is matched and loaded (managed by <code>kernelmanagerd</code>), the kernel instantiates a shadow object known as <code>IOUserServer</code>. This kernel-side object acts as the proxy for the userland driver.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Shim:</strong> When the kernel needs to call a function in the driver (e.g., <code>Start()</code>), it calls a method on <code>IOUserServer</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Serialization:</strong> <code>IOUserServer</code> serializes the arguments into a specialized Mach message format (distinct from standard MIG).</li>
<li><strong>The Upcall:</strong> The message is sent to the <code>dext</code> process. The DriverKit runtime (linked into the <code>dext</code>) deserializes the message and invokes the implementation of the <code>IOService</code> subclass in userland.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The <code>IOUserClient</code> Interface:</strong><br>
Conversely, when the <code>dext</code> needs to talk to the kernel (e.g., to register an interrupt handler or map memory), it cannot call kernel APIs directly. It uses <code>IOUserClient</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Restricted API Surface:</strong> The <code>dext</code> can only invoke a specific subset of kernel functionality exposed via <code>IOUserClient</code> traps. These traps are heavily scrutinized.</li>
<li><strong><code>OSAction</code>:</strong> Interrupts are no longer handled via ISRs (Interrupt Service Routines) in the driver. Instead, the kernel handles the physical IRQ, masks it, and dispatches an <code>OSAction</code> event to the <code>dext</code> via a Mach notification. This eliminates the entire class of vulnerabilities related to interrupt context safety and spinlock deadlocks in third-party code.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Entitlements as the Gatekeeper (TXM Enforcement):</strong><br>
In Tahoe, the ability of a <code>dext</code> to bind to specific hardware is governed by <strong>Entitlements</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hardware Binding:</strong> A <code>dext</code> cannot simply <code>mmap</code> any MMIO region. It must possess specific entitlements (e.g., <code>com.apple.developer.driverkit.transport.usb</code>) to access specific device families.</li>
<li><strong>TXM Verification:</strong> When <code>kernelmanagerd</code> launches a <code>dext</code>, the system verifies its signature and entitlements against LocalPolicy and trust caches. On SPTM/TXM-equipped systems, these checks are enforced below XNU, so a compromised <code>kernelmanagerd</code> cannot bypass them. If the TXM returns a failure, the kernel refuses to establish the <code>IOUserServer</code> link, and the driver fails to start.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>RE Focus: The <code>IOUserClass</code> Metaclass:</strong><br>
Reverse engineering a <code>dext</code> requires understanding the <code>OSMetaClass</code> infrastructure in userland. The <code>dext</code> binary contains <code>OSMetaClass</code> information that describes the RPC interface. By parsing the <code>__DATA,__const</code> sections, one can reconstruct the vtables and the mapping between the kernel-side dispatch IDs and the userland C++ methods.</p>
<h4 id="722-memory-mapping-constraints-and-iommu-dart-protection">7.2.2 Memory Mapping Constraints and IOMMU (DART) Protection</h4>
<p>The most dangerous capability of a driver is <strong>Direct Memory Access (DMA)</strong>. A malicious or buggy driver could program a peripheral (like a GPU or Network Card) to write data to physical address <code>0x0</code> (or wherever the kernel text resides), bypassing CPU-enforced protections like KTRR.</p>
<p>To mitigate this, Apple Silicon employs a pervasive IOMMU architecture known as <strong>DART (Device Address Resolution Table)</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>The DART Architecture:</strong><br>
Every DMA-capable peripheral on the SoC sits behind a DART. The device does not see Physical Addresses (PA); it sees <strong>I/O Virtual Addresses (IOVA)</strong>. The DART translates IOVA → PA, enforcing permissions (Read/Write) at the page level.</p>
<p><strong>DriverKit Memory Model:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong><code>IOMemoryDescriptor</code>:</strong> When a <code>dext</code> allocates a buffer for DMA, it creates an <code>IOMemoryDescriptor</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Mapping:</strong> The <code>dext</code> calls <code>IOMemoryDescriptor::CreateMapping</code>. This triggers a call into the kernel.</li>
<li><strong>The Kernel's Role:</strong> The kernel allocates physical pages (<code>XNU_DATA</code>) and pins them.</li>
<li><strong>DART Programming:</strong> The kernel programs the DART associated with the specific hardware device controlled by the <code>dext</code>. It maps the physical pages to an IOVA range visible to that device.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The Tahoe/SPTM Enforcement:</strong><br>
In the Tahoe architecture, the kernel is no longer trusted to program the DARTs directly. If the kernel could write to DART registers, it could map the kernel's own text segment as writable to the GPU, then tell the GPU to overwrite it (a DMA attack).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SPTM Ownership:</strong> The physical pages containing the DART translation tables (or the MMIO registers controlling the DART) are typed as <code>SPTM_PRIVATE</code> or a specific hardware-protected type in the Frame Table.</li>
<li><strong>The <code>sptm_map_iommu</code> Selector:</strong> When the kernel needs to map a buffer for a <code>dext</code>, it issues a <code>GENTER</code> call to the SPTM.</li>
<li><strong>Validation:</strong> The SPTM verifies that the physical pages being mapped are <em>owned</em> by the <code>dext</code> (or are valid shared memory). It strictly forbids mapping any page typed <code>XNU_TEXT</code>, <code>PAGE_TABLE</code>, or <code>SPTM_PRIVATE</code> into a DART.</li>
<li><strong>Execution:</strong> The SPTM performs the write to the DART hardware.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MMIO Mapping Restrictions:</strong><br>
Similarly, when a <code>dext</code> needs to control hardware registers (MMIO), it requests a mapping.</p>
<ul>
<li>The kernel cannot simply map physical device memory into the <code>dext</code>'s address space.</li>
<li><strong>SPTM Validation:</strong> The SPTM only honors MMIO mapping requests that target ranges it recognizes as device registers for the given driver or device; ranges associated with secure components (SEP, KTRR controller) are excluded.</li>
<li>This ensures that a USB driver can <em>only</em> map the USB controller's registers, and cannot map the registers for the Secure Enclave Mailbox or the KTRR controller.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>RE Implication:</strong><br>
Exploiting a <code>dext</code> to gain kernel privileges is exponentially harder in Tahoe. Even if you gain code execution in the <code>dext</code> (Userland), you cannot issue arbitrary syscalls (sandbox), you cannot map kernel memory (VM isolation), and you cannot use the hardware device to perform DMA attacks against the kernel (SPTM-enforced DART). The attacker is contained within a hardware-enforced cage, limited to the specific capabilities of that one peripheral.</p>
<h3 id="73-the-graphics-stack-agx">7.3 The Graphics Stack (AGX)</h3>
<p>If the XNU kernel is the central nervous system, the <strong>Apple Graphics (AGX)</strong> stack is a secondary, alien brain grafted onto the SoC. On M-series silicon, the GPU is not merely a peripheral; it is a massive, autonomous compute cluster running its own proprietary operating system, managing its own memory translation, and executing a command stream that is almost entirely opaque to the main OS.</p>
<p>For the reverse engineer, AGX represents the largest and most complex attack surface in the kernel. The driver (<code>AGX.kext</code>) is enormous, the firmware is encrypted (until load), and the hardware interface is undocumented. In the Tahoe architecture, Apple has moved to aggressively sandbox this beast, wrapping the GPU's memory access in strict <strong>DART (Device Address Resolution Table)</strong> policies enforced by the SPTM to prevent DMA-based kernel compromises.</p>
<h4 id="731-rtkit-the-proprietary-rtos-running-on-the-gpu-coprocessor-asc">7.3.1 RTKit: The Proprietary RTOS running on the GPU Coprocessor (ASC)</h4>
<p>The GPU does not execute driver commands directly. Instead, the M-series SoC includes a dedicated <strong>Apple Silicon Coprocessor (ASC)</strong>—typically a hardened ARMv8-R or Cortex-M class core—that manages the GPU hardware. This coprocessor runs <strong>RTKit</strong>, Apple’s proprietary Real-Time Operating System.</p>
<p><strong>The Firmware Blob:</strong><br>
The kernel driver does not contain the logic to drive the GPU hardware registers directly. Instead, upon initialization (<code>AGX::start</code>), it loads a firmware payload from a firmware bundle on disk or embedded in the kext.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Format:</strong> The firmware is a standard Mach-O binary, often multi-architecture.</li>
<li><strong>Sections:</strong> It contains <code>__TEXT</code> and <code>__DATA</code> segments just like a userland program.</li>
<li><strong>RTKit Structure:</strong> Reverse engineering the firmware reveals a microkernel architecture. It has a scheduler, an IPC mechanism, and a set of "Endpoints" (services).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The RTKit IPC Protocol:</strong><br>
Communication between the XNU kernel (<code>AGX.kext</code>) and the ASC (<code>RTKit</code>) occurs via a shared memory mailbox protocol.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Mailbox Registers:</strong> The AP writes to a specific MMIO register to ring the doorbell of the ASC.</li>
<li><strong>Message Buffer:</strong> The message payload is placed in a shared memory ring buffer.</li>
<li><strong>Endpoints:</strong> The protocol is endpoint-based. Reverse engineering identifies specific service IDs running on the ASC, such as:
<ul>
<li><strong><code>EP_PM</code>:</strong> Power Management (Voltage/Clock gating).</li>
<li><strong><code>EP_GR</code>:</strong> Graphics Rendering (Command submission).</li>
<li><strong><code>EP_COMP</code>:</strong> Compute (GPGPU/Metal).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>RE Focus: The <code>RTKit</code> State Machine:</strong><br>
The <code>AGX.kext</code> contains extensive logging strings and state tracking for RTKit. By analyzing the <code>RTKit</code> class in the kext, one can reconstruct the message structures.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Crash Logs:</strong> When the GPU hangs, RTKit writes a "Coredump" to a shared buffer. The kernel captures this. Analyzing these logs reveals the internal memory layout of the ASC and the state of the GPU pipeline at the time of the crash.</li>
<li><strong>Filter Bypass:</strong> Historically, vulnerabilities existed where the kernel could send malformed IPC messages to the ASC, causing memory corruption <em>inside</em> the GPU firmware. While this doesn't directly yield Kernel R/W, compromising the ASC allows an attacker to use the GPU as a confused deputy for DMA attacks (see 7.3.3).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="732-iomobileframebuffer-iomfb-secure-framebuffers-and-exclave-compositing">7.3.2 <code>IOMobileFramebuffer</code> (IOMFB): Secure Framebuffers and Exclave Compositing</h4>
<p>While <code>AGX.kext</code> handles rendering, <strong><code>IOMobileFramebuffer.kext</code> (IOMFB)</strong> handles the display controller (DCP). This driver is responsible for the "Swap Chain"—taking the rendered frames and scanning them out to the display panel.</p>
<p><strong>The Unified Memory Architecture (UMA):</strong><br>
On Apple Silicon, the Framebuffer is just a region of system DRAM. <code>WindowServer</code> (userland) renders into an <code>IOSurface</code>. The physical pages backing this surface are passed to IOMFB, which programs the Display Coprocessor (DCP) to read from them.</p>
<p><strong>The Security Criticality:</strong><br>
IOMFB is a high-value target because it handles complex shared memory structures (<code>IOMFBSharedMemory</code>) mapped into both the kernel and userland (<code>WindowServer</code>).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fuzzing Surface:</strong> The <code>Connect</code> method and external methods of <code>IOMobileFramebufferUserClient</code> have historically been riddled with race conditions and bounds-checking errors.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tahoe and the "Secure Overlay":</strong><br>
In the Tahoe architecture, IOMFB's control over the display is no longer absolute. To support the <strong>Hardware Privacy Indicators</strong> (Green/Orange dots), reverse engineering suggests the display pipeline has been bifurcated.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Standard Pipe:</strong> Managed by IOMFB/WindowServer. Draws the desktop/apps.</li>
<li><strong>Secure Pipe:</strong> Managed by an <strong>Exclave</strong>. Draws the privacy indicators.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Hardware Compositing:</strong><br>
The compositing of these two pipes happens in the display hardware, not in memory.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Exclave owns a small, reserved framebuffer region.</li>
<li>The Display Controller overlays this region on top of the standard framebuffer <em>during scanout</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Immutability:</strong> Because the Secure Pipe's framebuffer memory is owned by the Exclave (and protected by the SPTM), neither the kernel nor the GPU can write to it. This guarantees that if the camera is on, the green dot <em>will</em> be visible, even if the kernel is compromised.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="733-dart-the-iommu-wall-and-dma-containment">7.3.3 DART: The IOMMU Wall and DMA Containment</h4>
<p>The GPU is effectively a DMA engine with the capability to read and write vast swathes of system memory. Without restriction, a compromised GPU firmware (or a malicious shader exploiting a GPU hardware bug) could overwrite kernel text or page tables.</p>
<p>To prevent this, the AGX hardware—and indeed every DMA-capable peripheral on the Apple Silicon SoC—sits behind a strict IOMMU known as the <strong>DART (Device Address Resolution Table)</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>DART Architecture and Stream IDs (SIDs):</strong><br>
The DART translates <strong>Device Virtual Addresses (DVA)</strong> used by the peripheral into <strong>Physical Addresses (PA)</strong> in DRAM. However, the translation is not monolithic; it is segmented by the source of the traffic.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stream IDs (SIDs):</strong> Every transaction on the SoC's Network-on-Chip (NoC) carries a hardware-generated Stream ID identifying the initiator (e.g., GPU Firmware, Vertex Fetcher, Display Controller).</li>
<li><strong>Context Banks:</strong> The DART maintains multiple translation contexts (similar to distinct <code>TTBR</code> roots).</li>
<li><strong>SID Matching:</strong> The DART hardware is configured to map specific SIDs to specific Context Banks. This allows isolation between different workloads on the same peripheral (e.g., isolating <code>WindowServer</code> rendering commands from a background compute shader).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Tahoe Enforcement (SPTM):</strong><br>
In pre-Tahoe systems, the kernel (<code>AGX.kext</code> or <code>IOMapper</code>) managed the DART page tables and the SID configuration registers directly. This meant a kernel attacker could disable DART, remap SIDs to privileged contexts, or map kernel memory into the GPU's address space to bypass KTRR.</p>
<p>In Tahoe, <strong>DART management is privileged to the SPTM.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Ownership:</strong> The physical pages containing the DART translation tables (L1/L2 TTEs) and the MMIO registers controlling SID configuration are typed as <code>SPTM_PRIVATE</code> (or a specific IOMMU_TABLE type) in the Frame Table.</li>
<li><strong>Mapping Requests:</strong> When <code>AGX.kext</code> needs to map a user's <code>IOSurface</code> for GPU access:
<ul>
<li>It pins the user pages.</li>
<li>It issues a <code>GENTER</code> call (Selector <code>sptm_map_iommu</code>).</li>
<li>It passes the DART ID, the Context ID, the DVA, and the PA.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Validation:</strong> The SPTM verifies:
<ul>
<li>The PA is valid <code>USER_DATA</code> (not Kernel Text, not Page Tables).</li>
<li>The DART ID corresponds to the GPU.</li>
<li><strong>SID Integrity:</strong> Crucially, the SPTM enforces the immutable binding between SIDs and Contexts. It ensures that the kernel cannot reconfigure the DART to allow an untrusted SID (e.g., the Neural Engine) to write to a Context Bank reserved for the Secure Enclave or Display Pipe.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Execution:</strong> The SPTM writes the DART PTE.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>RE Focus: The "GART" Attack Surface:</strong><br>
Despite SPTM protection, the logic <em>requesting</em> the mapping still resides in the kernel.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Aliasing:</strong> Can the kernel trick the SPTM into mapping the same physical page to two different DART contexts with different permissions?</li>
<li><strong>Stale TLBs:</strong> Does the SPTM correctly flush the DART TLB (<code>tlb_flush</code>) immediately after unmapping? If not, the GPU might retain access to a page that has been freed and reallocated to the kernel, leading to a Use-After-Free via DMA.</li>
<li><strong>Side Channels:</strong> The DART configuration registers (e.g., <code>TCR</code>, <code>TTBR</code>, and SID match registers) are trapped by the hardware to GL2. Attempting to write to the DART control base address from EL1 should trigger a synchronous exception. Reverse engineering the <code>IOMapper</code> class in IOKit will reveal the specific <code>GENTER</code> trampolines used to bridge these operations.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="80-userland-bootstrap-the-birth-of-pid-1">8.0 Userland Bootstrap: The Birth of PID 1</h2>
<p>The initialization of the XNU kernel culminates in mounting the root filesystem (the Signed System Volume) and creating the first userland process. In traditional UNIX systems, this is <code>init</code> (PID 1). On macOS, this role is fulfilled by <strong><code>launchd</code></strong>.</p>
<p><code>launchd</code> is not just a SysV-style init. It is:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>process supervisor</strong> that manages the lifecycle of daemons and agents.</li>
<li>The <strong>Mach bootstrap server</strong>, providing the string-to-port name service for most of userland.</li>
<li>A central <strong>policy enforcement point</strong> for IPC visibility and service availability.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the Tahoe architecture, <code>launchd</code> is also the first long-lived user process to run under the full scrutiny of the Trusted Execution Monitor (TXM) and associated integrity mechanisms. Its successful launch marks the handoff from the measured, firmware-controlled boot world to the userland environment.</p>
<h3 id="81-launchd-the-mach-port-broker">8.1 <code>launchd</code>: The Mach Port Broker</h3>
<p>The transition from kernel mode to user mode is effectively one-way for the thread that becomes PID 1: once it crosses into userland, it never returns to the kernel in its original identity.</p>
<p>After early initialization in <code>bsd_init()</code> (mounting root, bringing up the BSD subsystem), the kernel:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Spawns a special kernel thread (often referred to conceptually as the <code>bsdinit_task</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uses <code>bsd_utaskbootstrap()</code> to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allocate <code>initproc</code> (PID 1) and its backing <code>task_t</code>.</li>
<li>Load the <code>launchd</code> Mach-O binary into that task via <code>load_init_program()</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>From this point on:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>launchd</code> becomes the root of the userland process tree.</li>
<li>All subsequent processes are, ultimately, descendants of PID 1.</li>
<li><code>launchd</code>’s management of Mach ports and bootstrap namespaces becomes the primary mechanism by which services discover each other and enforce IPC-based policy.</li>

<p>Constructs the initial user address space:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maps <code>__TEXT</code> read/execute.</li>
<li>Maps <code>__DATA</code> read/write.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sets up the initial user thread state (PC, stack, registers) as if an <code>execve</code> had just succeeded.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Trust and integrity checks (conceptual model):</strong><br>
On Tahoe systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The code signature and CDHash of <code>launchd</code> are validated against the Static Trust Cache and platform policy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TXM/SPTM participate in ensuring that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only a measured, signed <code>launchd</code> binary becomes PID 1.</li>
<li>Its text pages are mapped in a way that respects kernel integrity protection (no ad-hoc remapping to writable/executable later without violating SPTM policy).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The exact firmware call sequence is implementation detail, but the net effect is: <strong>if <code>launchd</code> is not exactly the expected, signed binary, the system does not proceed into userland.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The <code>host_priv</code> handoff</strong></p>
<p>As part of bringing up the userland environment:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The system needs a trusted process that can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Talk to host-level interfaces (<code>host_get_special_port</code>, etc.).</li>
<li>Manage systemwide services and kext/kc configuration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><code>launchd</code> is that process. During or shortly after PID 1 construction:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The kernel ensures that <code>launchd</code> can obtain the <strong>host-privileged port</strong> (<code>host_priv</code>) by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing a host send right via initial special ports, or</li>
<li>Allowing <code>launchd</code> to call <code>host_get_host_priv_port()</code> successfully.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subsequent privileged daemons (e.g. <code>kernelmanagerd</code>) obtain their own host-level capabilities via <code>launchd</code>-mediated configuration or direct <code>host_get_special_port</code> calls, subject to entitlements.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><code>launchd</code> is therefore the first <strong>userland holder of host-level control</strong> needed to configure the rest of the system, but it is not necessarily the only holder for the entire lifetime of the OS.</p>
<h4 id="812-initializing-the-bootstrap-port-subset-of-the-name-service">8.1.2 Initializing the Bootstrap Port (Subset of the Name Service)</h4>
<p>Mach does not provide any built-in string-based name service. Name→port mappings are implemented in userland by the bootstrap server, which on macOS is <code>launchd</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Bootstrap port assignment</strong></p>
<p>Every task in XNU has a special port slot, <code>TASK_BOOTSTRAP_PORT</code>. For PID 1:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When <code>launchd</code> is created, the kernel associates a bootstrap server port with <code>launchd</code>’s <code>TASK_BOOTSTRAP_PORT</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For child processes spawned by <code>launchd</code>, this slot is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inherited from the parent, or</li>
<li>Replaced with a more restricted bootstrap port representing a subset namespace (e.g. per-user or per-session domain).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>From userland’s perspective:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>bootstrap_port</code> in the <code>bootstrap_*</code> APIs (and the default XPC bootstrap connection) is whatever send right is stored in <code>TASK_BOOTSTRAP_PORT</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Namespace hierarchy (domains)</strong></p>
<p>Modern <code>launchd</code> organizes the bootstrap namespace into <strong>domains</strong>, which correspond roughly to what <code>launchctl</code> exposes as specifiers:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>system/</code> – The system-wide daemon domain (LaunchDaemons, root services).</li>
<li><code>user/&lt;uid&gt;/</code> – Per-UID domains for LaunchAgents.</li>
<li><code>gui/&lt;uid&gt;/</code> – GUI domains for interactive sessions per user.</li>
<li><code>login/&lt;asid&gt;/</code> or <code>session/&lt;asid&gt;/</code> – Per-login/per-ASID domains for specific authenticated sessions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each domain has:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its own subset of registered service names.</li>
<li>Its own set of policies controlling access and visibility.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these domains ultimately terminate in the same PID-1 <code>launchd</code> process, but they appear as distinct bootstrap ports and namespaces from the point of view of tasks.</p>
<p><strong>The bootstrap port in practice</strong></p>
<p>When a daemon is launched, it typically:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Receives a bootstrap port (for its domain) in its <code>TASK_BOOTSTRAP_PORT</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Calls:</p>
<pre><code>bootstrap_check_in(bootstrap_port,
                   "com.apple.locationd",
                   &amp;service_port);
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>launchd</code> receives this message on the appropriate domain’s bootstrap port and:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verifies, via the audit token, that the caller is the process associated with the job for <code>"com.apple.locationd"</code>.</li>
<li>Transfers the receive right for the pre-allocated service port into the daemon’s IPC space.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Client processes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use <code>bootstrap_look_up()</code> or <code>xpc_connection_create_mach_service()</code> on <em>their</em> bootstrap port.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>launchd</code> resolves the name in the caller’s domain and either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Returns a send right to the service port, or</li>
<li>Fails with an error if the service does not exist or is not visible in that domain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This mechanism:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implements the lazy, on-demand launch of services.</li>
<li>Enforces which names exist and are reachable in each domain, with <code>launchd</code> as the central broker.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="813-parsing-launchdplist-and-the-binary-protocol-for-xpc-service-lookups">8.1.3 Parsing <code>launchd.plist</code> and the Binary Protocol for XPC Service Lookups</h4>
<p><code>launchd</code>’s configuration is driven by property lists (<code>.plist</code>) describing jobs, located under:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>/System/Library/LaunchDaemons</code></li>
<li><code>/Library/LaunchDaemons</code></li>
<li><code>/System/Library/LaunchAgents</code></li>
<li><code>/Library/LaunchAgents</code></li>
<li>Per-user equivalents under <code>~/Library/LaunchAgents</code></li>
</ul>
<p>At startup (and when configuration changes), <code>launchd</code> parses these plists once and compiles them into an internal data structure representing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jobs (labels, binaries, arguments, environments).</li>
<li>Their <strong>MachServices</strong>.</li>
<li>Their target domain (system/user/gui/login).</li>
<li>Policy metadata (KeepAlive, RunAtLoad, sockets, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The <code>MachServices</code> dictionary</strong></p>
<p>A typical job might include:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;key&gt;MachServices&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;dict&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;com.apple.securityd&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;true/&gt;
&lt;/dict&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This instructs <code>launchd</code> to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Allocate a Mach receive right for <code>"com.apple.securityd"</code> when loading the job.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hold that right until:</p>
<ul>
<li>A client first looks up <code>"com.apple.securityd"</code>, and</li>
<li>The job has started and checked in.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><code>launchd</code> remembers:</p>
<ul>
<li>The mapping <code>"com.apple.securityd" → (job, receive-right)</code>.</li>
<li>Which domain that name belongs to.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Demand launching (lazy activation)</strong></p>
<p>The common path for a client is:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The client calls:</p>

                                       dispatch_get_main_queue(),
                                       0);
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>libxpc</code> sends a message to the caller’s bootstrap port asking for <code>"com.apple.securityd"</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>launchd</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Looks up <code>"com.apple.securityd"</code> in the caller’s domain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the job is not running:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spawns the configured binary via <code>posix_spawn</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Waits for the daemon to call <code>bootstrap_check_in()</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the daemon calls <code>bootstrap_check_in()</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>launchd</code> confirms the caller matches the job.</li>
<li>Transfers the receive right for the service port into the daemon’s IPC space.</li>
<li>Returns a send right to the client.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>From the client’s perspective, the detail is hidden: it just sees an XPC connection that becomes ready.</p>
<p><strong>Binary protocols: MIG vs XPC</strong></p>
<p>Historically:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>launchd</code> exposed a MIG-based API defined in <code>bootstrap.defs</code>, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>bootstrap_look_up</code></li>
<li><code>bootstrap_check_in</code></li>
<li><code>bootstrap_create_server</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>These are still present and supported.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Modern userland prefers <strong>XPC</strong>, which:</p>
<ul>
<li>Packages requests into binary dictionaries and sends them over Mach ports.</li>
<li>Allows richer types (arrays, dictionaries, file descriptors, additional Mach ports) to be transported in a structured way.</li>
</ul>
<p>Inside <code>launchd</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A central Mach receive loop demultiplexes incoming messages:</p>
<ul>
<li>MIG messages (identified by the Mach message ID) are routed to autogenerated handlers from <code>bootstrap.defs</code>.</li>
<li>XPC messages (identified by XPC magic/version fields in the payload) are parsed into XPC objects and dispatched to XPC-specific handlers (job control, service lookup, status queries).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Domain-aware policy</strong></p>
<p>On Tahoe-era systems, the bootstrap namespace is also used as a policy boundary:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The kernel attaches an audit token to each Mach message, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>PID, UID, GID, ASID, and other identity information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>launchd</code> inspects:</p>
<ul>
<li>The audit token.</li>
<li>The caller’s entitlements and sandbox profile (when available).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>It enforces constraints such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only processes with appropriate <code>mach-lookup</code> entitlements can resolve certain global services.</li>
<li>Sandboxed apps see only a restricted subset of services in their effective bootstrap domain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words:</p>
<ul>
<li>The bootstrap namespace is not just a <strong>map</strong> from string to port.</li>
<li>It is also a <strong>filter</strong>, with <code>launchd</code> acting as the enforcement point that decides which ports a given client is even allowed to know exist.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="82-the-dynamic-linker-dyld">8.2 The Dynamic Linker (<code>dyld</code>)</h3>
<p>If <code>launchd</code> is the architect of the userland process hierarchy, <strong><code>dyld</code></strong> (the dynamic linker) is the component that materializes each process image. In the macOS ecosystem, <code>dyld</code> is not merely a library loader; it is a privileged extension of the kernel’s execution model, responsible for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Loading the main executable and its dependent images.</li>
<li>Enforcing <strong>Library Validation</strong> policies.</li>
<li>Applying <strong>Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)</strong>.</li>
<li>On arm64e, integrating with <strong>Pointer Authentication (PAC)</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>On Apple Silicon and in the Tahoe architecture, <code>dyld</code> has been heavily reworked. Legacy rebasing mechanisms have been replaced with <strong>Chained Fixups</strong> to enable page-in linking, and <code>dyld</code>’s decisions are tightly coupled with the kernel’s memory management, which itself is constrained by the <strong>Secure Page Table Monitor (SPTM)</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="821-mapping-the-dyld-shared-cache-dsc">8.2.1 Mapping the Dyld Shared Cache (DSC)</h4>
<p>The <strong>Dyld Shared Cache (DSC)</strong> is a defining feature of the macOS userland memory layout. It is a massive, pre-linked binary (often &gt;4 GiB) that merges the text and data segments of most system frameworks (<code>CoreFoundation</code>, <code>libSystem</code>, <code>Foundation</code>, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>The Shared Region:</strong></p>
<p>To optimize memory and TLB usage, the kernel reserves a <strong>Shared Region</strong> in every process:</p>
<ul>
<li>On arm64, this region typically begins at a high canonical address (e.g., around <code>0x180000000</code> in current releases).</li>
<li>The DSC is mapped into this region, and the backing physical pages are shared across all processes.</li>
</ul>
<p>To satisfy <code>W^X</code> and fine-grained data protection, the DSC is split into multiple mappings:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong><code>__TEXT</code> (RX):</strong><br>
Immutable code and constant data that must never be written at runtime.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>__DATA_CONST</code> (RO):</strong><br>
Read-only data that can be pre-relocated at build time and never changes at runtime (e.g., constant pointers, vtables).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>__DATA_DIRTY</code> (RW):</strong><br>
Data that must diverge per process (e.g., Objective-C class realization state, global variables).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The Tahoe/SPTM Constraint:</strong></p>
<p>On Tahoe systems, the mapping of the DSC is mediated by SPTM:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Source from Cryptex:</strong><br>
The DSC binaries and associated metadata reside in the <strong>OS Cryptex</strong>, typically under:</p>
<pre><code>/System/Cryptexes/OS/System/Library/dyld/
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SPTM-Supervised Mapping:</strong><br>
When XNU initializes the shared region, it installs page tables for the DSC segments in each process’s address space. On SPTM-enabled systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each PTE change for DSC pages is vetted by SPTM.</li>
<li>The physical frames backing <code>__TEXT</code> are associated with a “immutable code” state; once mapped, they are not permitted to transition to writable mappings under EL1 control alone.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Immutable Code under a Compromised Kernel:</strong><br>
Because SPTM operates at a higher privilege level than the kernel:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arbitrary EL1 writes cannot simply flip the DSC <code>__TEXT</code> pages to <code>RWX</code>.</li>
<li>Any attempt to create new executable mappings for code that has not been validated by TXM can be blocked by SPTM when the Execute bit is requested.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Practically, this means traditional techniques that patch system libraries in-place from a kernel exploit are structurally constrained. Attackers must rely on indirection (e.g., hooks via <code>__DATA_DIRTY</code>, PLT-style trampolines, or userland injecting new, separately validated images) rather than overwriting shared-cache code directly.</p>
<h4 id="822-re-focus-code-signature-validation-fcntlfaddfilesigs-and-the-call-to-txm">8.2.2 <strong>RE Focus:</strong> Code Signature Validation (<code>fcntl(F_ADDFILESIGS)</code>) and the Call to TXM</h4>
<p><code>dyld</code> is the primary enforcer of <strong>Library Validation</strong> for userland. The OS policy is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A process can only execute code that has been validated by the platform’s code-signing machinery, and for hardened processes, only from binaries signed by Apple or by the same Team ID as the main executable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When <code>dyld</code> loads a Mach-O image, either during initial process launch or via <code>dlopen</code>, the high-level flow is:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong><code>mmap</code> of the file:</strong><br>
The file is mapped into the address space with appropriate protections (typically at least readable, but not yet executable).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Signature Registration via <code>F_ADDFILESIGS_RETURN</code>:</strong><br>
<code>dyld</code> calls:</p>
<pre><code>struct fsignatures fs;
fcntl(fd, F_ADDFILESIGS_RETURN, &amp;fs);
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>fsignatures_t</code> structure informs the kernel where the code-signature blob (CMS) resides in the file and requests that this file be authorized for executable mappings.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>On older architectures, the kernel (plus AMFI) parsed and validated the CMS blob in EL1. On Tahoe systems, validation is mediated by TXM, and enforcement by SPTM.</p>
<p><strong>Conceptual Kernel → TXM Flow:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Marshalling:</strong><br>
The kernel identifies the physical frames that contain:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Mach-O Code Directory.</li>
<li>The CMS code-signature blob.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Secure Monitor Invocation:</strong><br>
The kernel issues a secure call into TXM (e.g., via a <code>GENTER</code>-style transition), passing:</p>
<ul>
<li>References to those frames.</li>
<li>Metadata for the code-signing request (team identifier, flags, platform binary vs third-party, etc.).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>TXM Verification:</strong><br>
Inside TXM:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The CMS blob is parsed and the signature chain is validated against:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Static Trust Cache</strong> (for platform binaries shipped with the OS/Cryptexes), or</li>
<li>Apple’s CA hierarchy (for third-party code).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Policy constraints are applied (e.g., hardened runtime flags, entitlements, revocation status).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Verdict and SPTM Tagging:</strong><br>
TXM returns a verdict to the kernel. If the code is accepted:</p>
<ul>
<li>SPTM is updated with metadata that associates the relevant CDHash and physical frames with a “blessed for execution” state.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Page-Fault-Time Enforcement:</strong><br>
When the process later executes into that image:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The first access to a given code page triggers a page fault.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The kernel attempts to install an executable PTE for that frame.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SPTM intercepts the attempt and checks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whether the frame was previously “blessed” by TXM for this CDHash.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the check fails, the mapping is refused and the process is terminated (e.g., with <code>SIGKILL | Code Signature Invalid</code>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The exact internal data structures and opcodes used between kernel, TXM, and SPTM are firmware implementation details. From the perspective of <code>dyld</code>, the observable behaviour is that <code>F_ADDFILESIGS_RETURN</code> can succeed or fail, and that executing unblessed code results in immediate termination, independent of kernel cooperation.</p>
<p><strong>RE Tip:</strong><br>
When a process dies immediately after <code>dlopen</code> or after loading a plugin/framework, and <code>dyld</code> reports code-signature errors, the proximate userland symptom is often a failed <code>fcntl(F_ADDFILESIGS_RETURN)</code> or an immediate crash on first execution into the library. The authoritative reason (revoked certificate, missing trust-cache entry, policy violation) lives in TXM/SPTM logs and kernel log events, which may be partially redacted on production builds.</p>
<h4 id="823-aslr-in-userland-chained-fixups-and-the-death-of-dyldinfo">8.2.3 ASLR in Userland: Chained Fixups and the Death of <code>dyld_info</code></h4>
<p>Modern <code>dyld</code> (dyld 4.x and later) on Apple Silicon has effectively deprecated the legacy <code>LC_DYLD_INFO</code> rebasing/binding opcodes in favour of <strong>Chained Fixups</strong> (<code>LC_DYLD_CHAINED_FIXUPS</code>). This transition is not just a performance optimization; it is a fundamental change to how relocation metadata is encoded, tightly integrating ASLR and, on arm64e, PAC.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations of Legacy Rebasing:</strong></p>
<p>The previous model stored relocation metadata as a stream of opcodes (<code>REBASE_OPCODE_DO_*</code>, <code>BIND_OPCODE_*</code>) that described where in <code>__DATA</code> to add the ASLR slide and how to bind imports. At launch, <code>dyld</code> walked these opcode streams and:</p>
<ul>
<li>Touched every page that contained a relocatable pointer.</li>
<li>Dirtying pages that might never be read, impacting both memory footprint and cache behaviour.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chained Fixups: On-Disk Representation:</strong></p>
<p>In the chained fixup model, on-disk “pointers” in the <code>__DATA</code> segments are actually <strong>encoded metadata</strong>. For each image:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>LC_DYLD_CHAINED_FIXUPS</code> points to a <code>dyld_chained_fixups_header</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This header references a <code>dyld_chained_starts_in_image</code> structure, which contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>Per-segment start tables (<code>dyld_chained_starts_in_segment</code>), and</li>
<li>For each participating segment, an array giving the offset of the first fixup in each 16 KiB page (or <code>0xFFFF</code> if the page has none).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At each fixup location, the file contains a 64-bit encoded value such as <code>dyld_chained_ptr_64_rebase</code> or <code>dyld_chained_ptr_arm64e</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A subset of bits encode:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>next</code> delta (in 4-byte units) to the next fixup in the same page.</li>
<li>The <code>target</code> (either an offset into <code>__TEXT</code> for rebasing or an ordinal into the import table for binding).</li>
<li>For arm64e, authentication flags and diversity bits.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <code>next</code> value of <code>0</code> terminates the chain for that page.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Page-In Linking (Lazy Fixups):</strong></p>
<p>With chained fixups, <code>dyld</code> no longer performs a global sweep at launch:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Initial Mapping:</strong><br>
The image is mapped into memory with its <code>__TEXT</code> and <code>__DATA</code> segments, but most <code>__DATA</code> pages have not yet been faulted in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>First Access / Page Fault:</strong><br>
When the process first reads or writes through a pointer in <code>__DATA</code> that resides on a page with chained fixups:</p>
<ul>
<li>A page fault is triggered.</li>
<li>The kernel or a user-mode handler notes that this page has pending fixups.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Chain Walk:</strong><br>
The fixup logic:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consults the per-page start offset from <code>dyld_chained_starts_in_image</code>.</li>
<li>Walks the chain by following <code>next</code> deltas until the chain terminates.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Applying Fixups:</strong><br>
For each encoded “pointer”:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <code>target</code> is interpreted as:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <code>__TEXT</code> offset to be combined with the ASLR slide (for rebasing), or</li>
<li>An import ordinal resolved to a symbol address (for binding).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>On arm64e, the final pointer is authenticated:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>PAC( Base + Offset, Key, Context/Discriminator )</code> is computed using process-specific PAC keys.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 64-bit metadata word on the page is overwritten with the final, signed, slid pointer.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>After Fixup:</strong><br>
The page is now dirty (because the encoded metadata was overwritten), but only the pages that are actually accessed incur this cost.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>PAC Integration (<code>DYLD_CHAINED_PTR_ARM64E</code>):</strong></p>
<p>On arm64e, fixup entries use formats like <code>DYLD_CHAINED_PTR_ARM64E</code> and <code>DYLD_CHAINED_PTR_ARM64E_AUTH_*</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fields encode:</p>
<ul>
<li>Key selection (instruction/data key).</li>
<li>Diversity bits (salt).</li>
<li>Discriminator/context.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>dyld</code> computes PAC for each pointer at fixup time:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ensuring that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The pointer is valid only under the current process’s PAC keys.</li>
<li>Attempts to transplant the pointer into another process or mutate the context bits will cause PAC failures at use.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>ASLR and PAC are therefore coupled at the moment a page is faulted in and its fixups applied.</p>
<p><strong>Reverse-Engineering Implications:</strong></p>
<p>For reverse engineers, chained fixups fundamentally alter the static picture of binaries:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raw on-disk <code>__DATA</code> segments no longer contain meaningful absolute pointers; they contain encoded metadata words.</li>
<li>Naive disassembly or CFG reconstruction that ignores chained fixups will see “garbage” addresses and broken callgraphs.</li>
<li>Correct analysis requires simulating <code>dyld</code>’s fixup engine to compute the final pointers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tooling must therefore:</p>

<h3 id="83-cryptexes-cryptographic-extensions">8.3 Cryptexes (Cryptographic Extensions)</h3>
<p>The introduction of the <strong>Signed System Volume (SSV)</strong> in macOS Big Sur solved the problem of persistence: by anchoring the root filesystem in a cryptographic hash verified by iBoot, Apple ensured that the core OS partition is immutable. However, this immutability created an operational problem: patching a single high-level component (for example, <code>dyld</code> or WebKit) would require resealing and redistributing the entire SSV.</p>
<p>To resolve the tension between <strong>immutability</strong> and <strong>agility</strong>, Apple introduced <strong>Cryptexes</strong> (Cryptographic Extensions). A Cryptex is a cryptographically sealed, versioned filesystem image that can be mounted and “grafted” into the system hierarchy at boot or runtime. In the Tahoe architecture, Cryptexes are the primary mechanism for the <strong>Split OS</strong> design, decoupling the kernel/BSD and low-level system from rapidly evolving userland components.</p>
<h4 id="831-the-%E2%80%9Csplit-os%E2%80%9D-architecture-systemcryptexesos">8.3.1 The “Split OS” Architecture: <code>/System/Cryptexes/OS</code></h4>
<p>In modern macOS, the logical root filesystem (<code>/</code>) is effectively a skeleton:</p>
<ul>
<li>it contains the sealed snapshot of the kernel and core boot artifacts on the SSV, and</li>
<li>it carries just enough structure to support bootstrapping.</li>
</ul>
<p>The bulk of high-level userland—<code>dyld</code>, <code>libSystem</code>, system frameworks, many daemons—resides in the <strong>OS Cryptex</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>The Image4 Container</strong></p>
<p>A Cryptex is distributed as an <strong>Image4 (<code>img4</code>) container</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Payload (<code>IM4P</code>):</strong><br>
A disk image (typically APFS) containing a filesystem hierarchy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Manifest (<code>IM4M</code>):</strong><br>
A signed metadata blob that binds the payload to Apple’s root keys. For some Cryptexes, the manifest can be <strong>personalized</strong> (tied to ECID, board, and security domain), preventing naive replay of mismatched OS components onto other devices.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mounting and Grafting</strong></p>
<p>Cryptexes are not mounted via a user-visible <code>mount(2)</code> call. They are integrated into the system by early boot code and the APFS driver:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>iBoot handoff:</strong><br>
iBoot locates the OS Cryptex image (commonly on the Preboot volume), validates the <code>IM4M</code> signature against hardware-anchored keys, and arranges for the payload to be visible to the kernel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Trust cache extraction:</strong><br>
Inside the Cryptex, a binary trust cache (for example, <code>wrapper/trustcache</code>) lists CDHashes for all executable content in that Cryptex.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>TXM ingestion:</strong><br>
Before the filesystem is grafted, this trust cache is provided to TXM. TXM verifies its signature and, on success, merges the hashes into the platform’s Static Trust Cache for that boot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>APFS grafting / firmlinks:</strong><br>
The APFS driver performs a graft operation that logically attaches the Cryptex under:</p>
<pre><code>/System/Cryptexes/OS
</code></pre>
<p>and uses <strong>firmlinks</strong> or equivalent redirections so that paths like:</p>
<pre><code>/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib
/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreFoundation.framework/...
</code></pre>
<p>are transparently resolved into the OS Cryptex, even though the SSV copy of <code>/usr</code> and <code>/System/Library</code> is skeletal.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>From a reverse-engineering perspective, the “real” binaries of interest (current <code>dyld</code>, system frameworks, many daemons) live under <code>/System/Cryptexes/OS/...</code>. Paths under <code>/System/Library</code> or <code>/usr/lib</code> may be firmlinked views pointing back into this Cryptex.</p>
<h4 id="832-rapid-security-response-rsr-patching-via-overlay-cryptexes">8.3.2 Rapid Security Response (RSR): Patching via Overlay Cryptexes</h4>
<p>The Cryptex mechanism enables <strong>Rapid Security Response (RSR)</strong>: security updates that patch critical components without requiring a full OS update or resealing of the SSV.</p>
<p><strong>Patch Cryptexes</strong></p>
<p>An RSR is delivered as an additional Cryptex:</p>
<ul>
<li>it usually contains only the components that changed (for example, updated dyld shared caches or WebKit frameworks),</li>
<li>it ships with its own Image4 manifest and trust cache, validated similarly to the base OS Cryptex.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overlay / Union Mounting</strong></p>
<p>When an RSR is applied:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Staging (<code>cryptexd</code>):</strong><br>
The <code>cryptexd</code> daemon orchestrates download, local verification, and placement of the new Cryptex image (typically onto the Preboot volume), and updates boot policy so early boot components know it exists.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Verification and trust cache update:</strong><br>
During boot, the RSR Cryptex’s manifest is verified. Its embedded trust cache is ingested by TXM so that binaries from the RSR are eligible for execution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Overlaying the OS Cryptex:</strong><br>
The kernel overlays the RSR Cryptex on top of the base OS Cryptex using a union-style strategy:</p>
<ul>
<li>if a path exists in the RSR Cryptex, that version takes precedence;</li>
<li>otherwise, the VFS falls back to the underlying base OS Cryptex content.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The effective runtime view is:</p>
<pre><code>SSV  +  OS Cryptex  +  (optional) RSR Cryptex overlay
</code></pre>
<p>with VFS and firmlink logic ensuring a coherent <code>/System</code> and <code>/usr</code> layout.</p>
<p><strong>Reversibility and Failure Handling</strong></p>
<p>RSRs are designed to be reversible:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Atomicity:</strong><br>
Boot policy ensures the system is either fully in “base OS” state or in “base OS + specific RSR overlay” state. Partial application is not supported.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rollback:</strong><br>
If repeated boots under a given RSR Cryptex fail (for example, due to a regression), the boot chain can mark that RSR as inactive and revert to the base OS Cryptex on subsequent boots, without modifying the SSV.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Security and RE Implications</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Replay resistance:</strong><br>
Because Cryptexes and their trust caches are verified via Image4 and TXM, replaying older Cryptexes or RSRs is constrained by the same personalization and policy rules as the base OS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Persistence model:</strong><br>
RSRs live outside the SSV (typically on Preboot), but they remain in the verified boot chain via their manifests and trust caches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Analysis workflow:</strong><br>
To understand an RSR, you extract the RSR Cryptex image from the update payload, mount it, and diff its contents against the base OS Cryptex. The semantic delta is “what the RSR changed.” The live system view is the union of SSV + base OS Cryptex + any active RSR overlays, subject to SPTM/TXM integrity constraints.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="90-the-security-daemon-hierarchy">9.0 The Security Daemon Hierarchy</h2>
<p>While the kernel and the hardware monitors (SPTM/TXM) enforce the immutable laws of the system physics (memory protections, page table integrity, executable mappings), the complex, mutable business logic of macOS security is delegated to a hierarchy of userland daemons. These daemons operate with high privileges, often holding special ports or entitlements that allow them to influence kernel policy. For the reverse engineer, these daemons represent the “Policy Engine” of the OS—and historically, the most fertile ground for logic bugs and sandbox escapes.</p>
<h3 id="91-amfid-apple-mobile-file-integrity-daemon">9.1 <code>amfid</code> (Apple Mobile File Integrity Daemon)</h3>
<p>The <strong>Apple Mobile File Integrity Daemon (<code>amfid</code>)</strong> is the userland arbiter of code execution policy. While the <strong>TXM</strong> enforces code-execution policy and manages trust caches for platform binaries in the guarded world, it lacks the context to evaluate the complex web of third-party provisioning profiles, developer certificates, notarization state, and MDM constraints.</p>
<p>In the Tahoe architecture, <code>amfid</code> functions as the <strong>Policy Decision Point (PDP)</strong> for non-platform code, while the kernel and TXM act as the <strong>Policy Enforcement Points (PEP)</strong> that ultimately decide whether pages become executable.</p>
<h4 id="911-the-interaction-between-launchd-the-kernel-macf-and-amfid">9.1.1 The Interaction between <code>launchd</code>, the Kernel (MACF), and <code>amfid</code></h4>
<p><code>amfid</code> does not poll for binaries; it is driven by the kernel via the <strong>Mandatory Access Control Framework (MACF)</strong> hooks in the AMFI/AppleMobileFileIntegrity path.</p>
<p><strong>The Bootstrap Race</strong></p>
<p><code>amfid</code> is a critical system daemon launched by <code>launchd</code> early in the boot process. Because <code>amfid</code> is responsible for verifying signatures, it presents a bootstrap paradox: <em>Who verifies <code>amfid</code>?</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Solution:</strong> <code>amfid</code> is a platform binary shipped as part of the system OS (delivered via the Signed System Volume and associated cryptexes). Its <strong>CDHash</strong> is included in the <strong>Static Trust Cache</strong> that iBoot hands to the kernel during early boot.</li>
<li><strong>TXM / AMFI Verification:</strong> When <code>launchd</code> spawns <code>amfid</code>, the kernel’s AMFI path consults TXM against the static trust cache. The CDHash is present, so the secure-world policy engine blesses the mapping immediately. No userland upcall is required for <code>amfid</code> itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>From this point onward, <code>amfid</code> becomes part of the trusted computing base: it is the userland process that encodes code-execution <em>policy</em> for everything that is <strong>not</strong> already covered by immutable trust caches.</p>
<p><strong>The Verification Upcall (The “Slow Path”)</strong></p>
<p>When a user launches a third-party application (for example, <code>/Applications/Calculator.app</code>), the flow traverses the boundary between kernel and userland multiple times.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The Hook</strong></p>
<p>The kernel executes <code>execve</code>. Along the AMFI path, the MACF hook <code>mpo_vnode_check_signature</code> in <code>AppleMobileFileIntegrity</code> is triggered. This hook is the choke point where the system decides whether the binary’s code signature is acceptable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>TXM / Trust Cache Miss</strong></p>
<p>The kernel (via AMFI) queries TXM in the guarded world (conceptually via an internal “GENTER”-style call). TXM consults the <strong>Static Trust Cache</strong> and the <strong>Dynamic Trust Cache</strong>.</p>
<p>For a newly launched, third-party app whose CDHash has never been seen before, this lookup fails: there is no matching entry in either cache.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Upcall</strong></p>
<p>On a trust-cache miss, the kernel must delegate policy to userland. It constructs a Mach message targeting the <strong><code>HOST_AMFID_PORT</code></strong> (host special port 18), which is bound to <code>amfid</code>.</p>
<p>The message carries:</p>
<ul>
<li>A send right to a <strong><code>fileport</code></strong> for the executable.</li>
<li>Metadata describing offsets and sizes (location of the code signature blob, file length, etc.).</li>
<li>The CDHash or code directory parameters needed for verification.</li>
</ul>
<p>Exact field layouts vary by OS release, but the kernel avoids trusting raw string paths where possible and instead relies on fileports and offsets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>amfid</code> Processing</strong></p>
<p><code>amfid</code> receives the MACH IPC and performs the heavy lifting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parses the <strong>CMS</strong> / code signature blob from the file.</li>
<li>Validates the certificate chain via <strong><code>libmis.dylib</code></strong> (Mobile Installation Service) and often IPC to <code>trustd</code>.</li>
<li>Extracts <strong>entitlements</strong> and, if present, an embedded <strong>provisioning profile</strong> (<code>embedded.mobileprovision</code>).</li>
<li>Applies policy derived from Developer Mode, MDM profiles, and local configuration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Verdict</strong></p>
<p><code>amfid</code> responds to the kernel with a MIG reply corresponding to the <code>verify_code_directory</code> routine. For the kernel, this effectively collapses to:</p>
<ul>
<li>A status code (success, profile mismatch, expired certificate, etc.).</li>
<li>Derived flags (e.g. whether <code>get-task-allow</code> is permitted).</li>
<li>Optionally, additional hints for AMFI.</li>
</ul>
<p>At this stage, the kernel updates the process’s <code>cs_flags</code> (Code Signing Flags), including bits such as <code>CS_GET_TASK_ALLOW</code> and <code>CS_HARD</code>, based on <code>amfid</code>’s verdict.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>TXM Update</strong></p>
<p>If <code>amfid</code> approves the binary, the kernel performs a second secure-world interaction: the CDHash and relevant metadata are added to the <strong>Dynamic Trust Cache</strong> managed under TXM’s control. Future launches of the same, unchanged binary can now be satisfied entirely in TXM and AMFI without repeating the upcall.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Security Note:</em> In Tahoe, the architecture is such that TXM remains the final authority on <strong>cryptographic validity</strong>. Even if the kernel or <code>amfid</code> were compromised, adding a CDHash to the dynamic trust cache requires passing TXM’s guardrails. <code>amfid</code> supplies the <em>policy</em> decision (“this developer identity / profile is acceptable here”), while TXM ensures that the code bytes actually match the identity being whitelisted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>RE Focus: The MIG Interface</strong></p>
<p>The communication interface is defined in the (reverse-engineered) MIG definition usually referred to as <code>mfi_server.defs</code>. The key routine is often named <code>verify_code_directory</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Input (conceptual):</strong> <code>audit_token_t</code> for the caller (kernel), <code>mach_port_t file_port</code>, offset and size parameters for the code signature, and flags controlling the verification mode.</li>
<li><strong>Attack Surface:</strong> Historically, malformed Mach messages to <code>amfid</code>’s service port produced classic parsing bugs. Modern macOS hardens this by:
<ul>
<li>Validating the <strong>audit token</strong> to ensure calls originate from <code>kernel_task</code>, not arbitrary userland.</li>
<li>Tightening the MIG server and argument validation paths.</li>
<li>Relying increasingly on fileports rather than untrusted string paths.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For reverse engineers, the MIG stubs and their error-handling paths remain prime targets for logic bugs and subtle policy bypasses.</p>
<h4 id="912-validating-code-directories-cdhash-entitlements-and-provisioning-profiles">9.1.2 Validating Code Directories (CDHash), Entitlements, and Provisioning Profiles</h4>
<p>The core logic of <code>amfid</code> resides in its ability to connect a binary’s <strong>Code Directory (CD)</strong> to a valid <strong>certificate chain</strong> and, when applicable, a <strong>Provisioning Profile</strong>. This mechanism enforces both the iOS-style “Walled Garden” and the macOS notarization regime.</p>
<p><strong>The Validation Logic (<code>MISValidateSignatureAndCopyInfo</code>)</strong></p>
<p><code>amfid</code> links against <code>libmis.dylib</code>, which exports the symbol <code>MISValidateSignatureAndCopyInfo</code>. This function encapsulates most of the signature and profile evaluation:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>CDHash Extraction</strong></p>
<p><code>amfid</code> reads the <code>LC_CODE_SIGNATURE</code> load command, locates the <strong>Code Directory</strong>, and computes the <strong>CDHash</strong> by hashing the slots specified by the Code Directory (typically a truncated SHA-256 or SHA-1, depending on platform and epoch).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Entitlement Extraction</strong></p>
<p>It parses the embedded entitlements plist from the signature blob. These entitlements express requested capabilities (e.g. <code>com.apple.security.network.client</code>, <code>com.apple.security.get-task-allow</code>, private IOKit entitlements).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Profile Correlation (Developer-Signed Binaries)</strong></p>
<p>When the binary is signed by a non-Apple certificate:</p>
<ul>
<li>It looks for an embedded provisioning profile (<code>embedded.mobileprovision</code>).</li>
<li>It verifies the <strong>PKCS#7</strong> signature of the profile, ensuring it is issued by Apple.</li>
<li>It compares the entitlements in the binary against the <code>Entitlements</code> dictionary in the profile, enforcing that the binary does not claim more than the profile grants.</li>
<li>For development profiles, it verifies that the device’s identifier (UDID / platform identifier) is present in the <code>ProvisionedDevices</code> array (or matches the profile’s “All Devices” semantics, depending on platform).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Constraint Enforcement</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Restricted Entitlements:</strong> Certain entitlements (for example, <code>com.apple.private.security.no-sandbox</code>, low-level IOKit and CSR overrides) are “restricted” and only grantable when the signature chain terminates in specific Apple internal CAs or special program certificates.</li>
<li><code>amfid</code> enforces this hierarchy by refusing binaries whose entitlements exceed what the provisioning profile and certificate chain permit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The “Union” of Trust: Notarization and Gatekeeper</strong></p>
<p>On macOS, this signature evaluation interacts with the <strong>notarization</strong> system, primarily implemented in <strong><code>syspolicyd</code></strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>At download or first execution, <strong>Gatekeeper</strong> and <code>syspolicyd</code> evaluate notarization tickets (stapled to the binary or stored under <code>/var/db/SystemPolicy*</code>) and decide whether the binary is admissible under current policy.</li>
<li>Once a binary is admitted, subsequent executions still traverse AMFI/<code>amfid</code>:
<ul>
<li><code>amfid</code> ensures that the running code’s signature and entitlements still match what was originally notarized.</li>
<li>It can treat notarized binaries as belonging to a higher trust tier compared to purely ad-hoc signatures (for example, relaxing some heuristics or additional scanning).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The effective trust decision is thus the intersection of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Static trust caches and TXM policy</strong> (platform code).</li>
<li><strong>Gatekeeper / notarization</strong> (admission control for untrusted downloads).</li>
<li><strong>AMFI + <code>amfid</code></strong> (per-execution verification and entitlement policy).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>RE Focus: <code>libmis.dylib</code> Reversing</strong></p>
<p><code>libmis.dylib</code> is heavily stripped and obfuscated, but it has a simple, observable contract:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>MISValidateSignatureAndCopyInfo</code> returns an integer status, where <code>0</code> indicates success and non-zero error codes map to specific failures (profile expired, certificate invalid, entitlements mismatch, etc.).</li>
<li><code>amfid</code> logs detailed failure reasons via <code>os_log</code> and friends. Many of these logs are visible only with specific boot arguments or developer configurations (for example, AMFI developer mode toggles).</li>
<li>Instrumenting the call sites and enumerating non-zero return codes is often the most efficient way to understand why a given binary is being killed or stripped of capabilities.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="913-exception-handling-how-get-task-allow-and-debugging-entitlements-are-processed">9.1.3 Exception Handling: How <code>get-task-allow</code> and Debugging Entitlements are Processed</h4>
<p>One of <code>amfid</code>’s most security-sensitive roles is gating access to process debugging. The ability to attach a debugger (<code>task_for_pid</code>) is effectively a full compromise of the target process.</p>
<p><strong>The <code>get-task-allow</code> Entitlement</strong></p>
<p>In a standard production configuration, a process cannot be debugged unless either:</p>
<ul>
<li>The system is in a special developer or recovery mode, <strong>or</strong></li>
<li>The target process possesses the <code>com.apple.security.get-task-allow</code> entitlement and other policy conditions are satisfied.</li>
</ul>
<p>Typical paths:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Xcode Builds:</strong> When an app is built and run from Xcode, the build system signs it with a development certificate and injects <code>get-task-allow</code>, allowing <code>debugserver</code>/<code>lldb</code> to obtain a task port.</li>
<li><strong>App Store Builds:</strong> The App Store distribution pipeline strips <code>get-task-allow</code> before submission; resulting binaries are non-debuggable under normal policy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The <code>amfid</code> Decision Matrix</strong></p>
<p>During <code>execve</code>, the kernel extracts entitlements and passes them (directly or indirectly) into the AMFI/<code>amfid</code> path:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>amfid</code> validates that <code>get-task-allow</code> appears in both:
<ul>
<li>The entitlements blob in the code signature.</li>
<li>The entitlements and capabilities granted by the provisioning profile / certificate chain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If the request is:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Valid:</strong> <code>amfid</code> indicates that <code>CS_GET_TASK_ALLOW</code> may be set in the process’s <code>cs_flags</code>. Subsequent <code>task_for_pid</code> checks can succeed (subject to further checks like caller UID, SIP bits, and TCC state).</li>
<li><strong>Invalid or Over-Privileged:</strong> <code>amfid</code> can cause the entitlement to be ignored or the entire signature to be rejected, leading to kill-on-launch or a process without debug permissions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The <code>task_for_pid</code> Check</strong></p>
<p>When <code>debugserver</code> or <code>lldb</code> calls <code>task_for_pid(target_pid)</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The kernel checks the target’s <code>cs_flags</code> (including <code>CS_GET_TASK_ALLOW</code>) and applies additional policy (root privileges, SIP bits such as <code>CSR_ALLOW_TASK_FOR_PID</code>, and TCC automations).</li>
<li>If the flags and policy allow it, the caller receives a send right to the target’s task port; otherwise, the call fails (e.g. <code>KERN_PROTECTION_FAILURE</code> / <code>KERN_FAILURE</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Developer Mode (The Tahoe Shift)</strong></p>
<p>In the Tahoe architecture, the presence of <code>get-task-allow</code> and a development certificate is no longer sufficient by itself. Debuggability is additionally gated by <strong>Developer Mode</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>State Check</strong></p>
<p>Developer Mode state is maintained by <strong>LocalPolicy</strong> and enforced via SPTM/TXM. The AMFI/<code>amfid</code> path consults this state (via private interfaces and entitlements) when evaluating signatures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enforcement</strong></p>
<p>If Developer Mode is <strong>disabled</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Binaries signed solely with development certificates are generally treated as untrusted for execution and debugging on end-user systems.</li>
<li>Even if the provisioning profile is otherwise valid, <code>amfid</code> and associated policy may refuse to honour <code>get-task-allow</code>, resulting in <code>cs_flags</code> that do not permit <code>task_for_pid</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This prevents the trivial side-loading of a “debuggable” app to inspect memory on a locked-down device; enabling Developer Mode requires an explicit, TXM-mediated ceremony that materially lowers the device’s security posture.</p>
<p><strong>Unrestricted Debugging, SIP, and AMFI</strong></p>
<p>On macOS, <strong>System Integrity Protection (SIP)</strong> and <strong>AMFI</strong> are distinct but interacting mechanisms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SIP (CSR Bits):</strong> SIP is configured via <code>csrutil</code> and boot arguments, setting bits such as <code>CSR_ALLOW_TASK_FOR_PID</code> (relaxing debugging restrictions), <code>CSR_ALLOW_UNRESTRICTED_FS</code>, and others.</li>
<li><strong>AMFI / <code>amfi_get_out_of_my_way</code>:</strong> On internal or development builds, AMFI can be disabled or relaxed via boot-args (e.g. <code>amfi_get_out_of_my_way=1</code>), effectively causing the kernel to bypass code-signing enforcement.</li>
</ul>
<p>Historically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting debug CSR bits like <code>CSR_ALLOW_TASK_FOR_PID</code> allowed broader debugging of system processes, but <strong>did not</strong> by itself disable AMFI’s signature checks.</li>
<li>Disabling AMFI (<code>amfi_get_out_of_my_way</code>) is what effectively causes the kernel to treat code signatures as trivially acceptable.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Tahoe:</p>
<ul>
<li>SIP state is one of the inputs into <strong>LocalPolicy</strong>, with TXM enforcing the resulting policy at the page-table and executable-mapping level.</li>
<li>AMFI and <code>amfid</code> still perform signature and entitlement checks, but some CSR bits continue to relax specific restrictions (for example, attaching a debugger to processes that would otherwise be non-debuggable).</li>
<li>Fully “everything is valid” behaviour is reserved for tightly controlled developer or internal configurations and is not reachable on production systems without both SIP and AMFI being simultaneously subverted.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="92-sandboxd-the-seatbelt-policy">9.2 <code>sandboxd</code> &amp; The Seatbelt Policy</h3>
<p>If <code>amfid</code> is the bouncer checking identities at the door, the <strong>Seatbelt</strong> subsystem (marketed as App Sandbox) is the straightjacket applied once code is inside. Originating from TrustedBSD, the macOS sandbox is a <strong>Mandatory Access Control (MAC)</strong> mechanism that restricts a process’s access to resources—files, sockets, Mach ports, IOKit drivers—regardless of the user’s UID.</p>
<p>In the Tahoe architecture, the sandbox has evolved from a predominantly path-based filter into a semantic, metadata-driven enforcement layer, tightly coupled with the kernel’s VFS and process credential machinery and integrated with new <strong>Data Vault</strong> primitives.</p>
<h4 id="921-compiling-sbpl-sandbox-policy-language-to-bytecode">9.2.1 Compiling SBPL (Sandbox Policy Language) to Bytecode</h4>
<p>Sandbox profiles are expressed in <strong>SBPL (Sandbox Policy Language)</strong>, a Scheme-like (LISP) dialect. The kernel does <strong>not</strong> interpret SBPL directly. Instead, policy is compiled into a compact bytecode format that the kernel executes.</p>
<p>The SBPL compiler lives primarily in <strong><code>libsandbox.dylib</code></strong> (and its libsystem glue), not in <code>sandboxd</code>.</p>
<p><strong>The Compilation Pipeline</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Profile Selection</strong></p>
<p>Depending on the process, different profiles are selected:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>App Store Apps:</strong> The system applies a generic <code>container</code> profile that implements the standard app sandbox.</li>
<li><strong>System Daemons:</strong> Daemons specify their profile name in their <code>launchd.plist</code> (for example, <code>com.apple.syslogd.sb</code>), which is resolved to an SBPL specification.</li>
<li><strong>Platform Profile:</strong> In modern macOS, many core policies are consolidated into a <strong>Platform Profile</strong> bundled with <code>Sandbox.kext</code> / the Boot Kernel Collection. Individual SBPL files for system services still exist, but the trend is toward more policy being pre-compiled into the kernel cache to reduce runtime parsing and external configuration surface.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Compiler (<code>libsandbox</code> / <code>libsystem_sandbox</code>)</strong></p>
<p>When a process initializes the sandbox (for example, via <code>sandbox_init_with_parameters</code>):</p>
<ul>
<li>The call enters <code>libsandbox.dylib</code> in the process address space.</li>
<li><code>libsandbox</code> parses the SBPL (often using an embedded TinyScheme derivative).</li>
<li>It resolves variable expansions such as <code>${HOME}</code>, <code>${TemporaryDirectory}</code>, and environment-dependent paths.</li>
<li>It compiles the SBPL rules into a proprietary <strong>bytecode</strong> representation.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>sandboxd</code> is not on this critical path. Its primary role is to receive violation reports and log denied operations; it is not the SBPL compiler.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Bytecode Structure</strong></p>
<p>The compiled blob is a serialized decision machine:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Opcodes:</strong> Operations such as “match path”, “match pattern”, “check entitlement”, “allow”, “deny”, and conditional branching.</li>
<li><strong>Filters:</strong> Rules are arranged into decision trees or tries keyed by operation class and path prefix (for example, file operations grouped under <code>/System</code>, <code>/Users</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>This bytecode is opaque to userland: it is handed to the kernel via the <code>__mac_syscall</code> / sandbox-specific syscalls, where <code>Sandbox.kext</code> attaches it to the process’s MAC label.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>RE Focus: Reversing the Binary Blob</strong></p>
<p>The kernel receives the compiled profile via a MACF-specific syscall (e.g. <code>__mac_syscall</code> with <code>SANDBOX_SET_PROFILE</code>):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Extraction:</strong> The blob can be captured by:
<ul>
<li>Hooking <code>sandbox_init*</code> / <code>sandbox_compile_*</code> inside <code>libsandbox</code>.</li>
<li>Hooking <code>sandbox_set_profile</code> / <code>__mac_syscall</code> at the userland boundary.</li>
<li>Extracting the label attached to the process in the kernel (<code>kauth_cred_t</code> → sandbox label).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Decompilation:</strong> Tools such as <code>sbs</code> (Sandbox Scrutinizer) or custom disassemblers lift the bytecode back into an SBPL-like intermediate representation.</li>
<li><strong>Profile Validation:</strong> In Tahoe, the kernel performs sanity checks on the bytecode (bounds checks, instruction validity, loop constraints) before attaching it to a process. This reduces the risk that a malformed profile can hang or crash kernel threads.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="922-the-sandbox-kernel-extension-hooking-syscalls-via-the-mac-framework">9.2.2 The Sandbox Kernel Extension: Hooking Syscalls via the MAC Framework</h4>
<p>The enforcement engine is <strong><code>Sandbox.kext</code></strong>, which hooks into the XNU kernel via the <strong>Mandatory Access Control Framework (MACF)</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>MACF Hooks</strong></p>
<p>XNU is instrumented with a large set of <code>mac_</code> hooks placed at security-critical bottlenecks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Filesystem:</strong> <code>mac_vnode_check_open</code>, <code>mac_vnode_check_rename</code>, <code>mac_vnode_check_unlink</code>, etc.</li>
<li><strong>IPC:</strong> <code>mac_mach_port_check_send</code>, <code>mac_mach_port_check_receive</code>.</li>
<li><strong>IOKit:</strong> <code>mac_iokit_check_open</code>, <code>mac_iokit_check_get_property</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>Sandbox.kext</code> registers a <strong>MAC policy</strong> via a <code>mac_policy_conf</code> structure whose function pointers implement these hooks.</p>
<p><strong>The Evaluation Flow</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Trigger</strong></p>
<p>A sandboxed process issues a syscall, for example:</p>
<p><code>open("/etc/passwd", O_RDONLY);</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>MACF Hook</strong></p>
<p>The kernel executes <code>mac_vnode_check_open</code>. MACF dispatches this call to all registered policies, including <code>Sandbox.kext</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Policy Dispatch</strong></p>
<p><code>Sandbox.kext</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Looks up the process’s <code>kauth_cred_t</code>.</li>
<li>Retrieves the <strong>sandbox label</strong>, which includes a pointer to the compiled profile bytecode.</li>
<li>Normalizes arguments (operation kind, path, vnode type, etc.) into a canonical form.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bytecode Evaluation</strong></p>
<p>The sandbox engine executes the profile bytecode:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Input:</strong> Operation (for example, <code>file-read</code>), resource (path <code>/etc/passwd</code>), additional attributes (file type, vnode flags).</li>
<li><strong>Logic:</strong> Traverses the pre-compiled decision tree, checking path prefixes, patterns, and entitlements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Caching (Performance Critical Path)</strong></p>
<p>Evaluating bytecode on every syscall would be prohibitively expensive, so <code>Sandbox.kext</code> maintains caches:</p>
<ul>
<li>Per-vnode caches: Attach allow/deny decisions to vnode labels once a decision has been made.</li>
<li>Per-process caches: Cache repeated deny decisions for patterns known to be disallowed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Subsequent accesses to the same file or resource often bypass the full bytecode interpreter and reuse cached verdicts.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>RE Vulnerability:</em> Bugs in cache invalidation (for example, renames, mount points, or attribute changes that fail to invalidate cached decisions) can lead to enforcement bypasses where the sandbox decision no longer reflects reality.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The Tahoe / SPTM Intersection</strong></p>
<p>While sandbox policy is defined in software, the integrity of the enforcement hooks is backed by hardware:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>mac_policy_conf</code> structures and many related function pointer tables reside in <strong>const</strong> segments (<code>__DATA_CONST</code>/<code>__CONST</code>) in the Boot Kernel Collection.</li>
<li><strong>SPTM/TXM</strong> enforce invariants on the kernel’s page tables, preventing EL1 code from remapping those const segments as writable, even under a kernel write primitive.</li>
</ul>
<p>This has two consequences:</p>
<ul>
<li>Classical rootkits that “unhook” sandbox enforcement by overwriting function pointers in <code>mac_policy_conf</code> are blocked at the page-table level: the attempted store either faults or writes to a non-effective alias.</li>
<li>The sandbox policy can still be subverted through more subtle means (policy loading, profile compilation, credential forgery), but transparent pointer overwrites of core hooks are no longer a viable attack on Tahoe-class hardware.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="923-containerization-data-vaults-and-group-containers">9.2.3 Containerization: Data Vaults and Group Containers</h4>
<p>In the Tahoe era, Apple has moved beyond simple path-based rules (fragile and prone to symlink and mountpoint attacks) toward <strong>semantic containerization</strong> of data.</p>
<p><strong>Data Vaults</strong></p>
<p>Data Vaults are used to protect the most sensitive data at rest—for example, Messages, Photos, and certain system databases.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Implementation:</strong> A Data Vault is typically a directory or volume flagged with specific VFS attributes (for example, the “datavault” flag and associated extended attributes).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enforcement:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Access decisions are made in MAC hooks <strong>before</strong> classic Discretionary Access Control (DAC). Even <code>root</code> (UID 0) cannot trivially <code>ls</code> or <code>cat</code> a Data Vault.</li>
<li>Access is granted only if the calling process holds specific, private entitlements (for example, <code>com.apple.private.security.storage.AppDataVault</code> or service-specific variants).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The “Root” Fallacy:</strong> Running as <code>root</code> with <code>host_priv</code> is no longer sufficient. Data Vault checks are keyed off entitlements and sandbox state, not UID.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>RE Focus:</strong> Kernel symbols such as <code>rootless_check_datavault_flag</code> and related helpers encode these checks. Reversing them reveals:</p>
<ul>
<li>How Data Vault flags are stored in the vnode and mount structures.</li>
<li>Which entitlements are accepted for a given vault class.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Group Containers</strong></p>
<p>To support IPC and data sharing between apps and their extensions (for example, a Widget and its host app), the sandbox introduces <strong>Group Containers</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The <code>application-group</code> Entitlement:</strong> Declares group IDs such as <code>group.com.example.app</code>. These IDs define shared container namespaces.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Container Manager:</strong> The system daemon <code>containermanagerd</code> manages the lifecycle and filesystem layout of these group directories (typically under <code>~/Library/Group Containers/</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sandbox Logic:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When compiling the app’s sandbox profile, <code>libsandbox</code> inspects entitlements.</li>
<li>For each <code>application-group</code> identifier, it injects rules that allow controlled read/write access to <code>${HOME}/Library/Group Containers/&lt;group-id&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>This binds filesystem access directly to the cryptographic identity of the executable: only code signed with a matching App Group entitlement can enter that directory.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For the reverse engineer, group containers provide a clear mapping from entitlements → filesystem layout; group container IDs found in entitlements can be used to locate shared state and attack surfaces.</p>
<h3 id="93-tccd-transparency-consent-and-control">9.3 <code>tccd</code> (Transparency, Consent, and Control)</h3>
<p>If <code>amfid</code> validates code identity and <code>sandboxd</code>/Seatbelt constrain code reach, <strong><code>tccd</code></strong> governs the most volatile part of the security model: <strong>user consent</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Transparency, Consent, and Control (TCC)</strong> subsystem is effectively a “User Intent Oracle”. It governs access to privacy-sensitive sensors (Camera, Microphone), personal data (Contacts, Calendars, Photos), and privileged capabilities (Full Disk Access, Screen Recording). In the Tahoe architecture, <code>tccd</code> has evolved from a simple “prompt and remember” component into a complex attribution engine that must defend against consent hijacking and attribution spoofing.</p>
<h4 id="931-the-tcc-database-schema-integrity-and-sip">9.3.1 The TCC Database: Schema, Integrity, and SIP</h4>
<p>TCC persists user consent state in SQLite databases. There is a split between system-wide and per-user state:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>System TCC:</strong> <code>/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db</code> — root-owned, stores system-wide decisions such as Full Disk Access.</li>
<li><strong>User TCC:</strong> <code>~/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db</code> — user-owned, stores per-user decisions such as Camera/Microphone access.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Schema</strong></p>
<p>The core table is <code>access</code>. For reverse engineering, key columns include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>service</code>:</strong> Identifies the privilege (e.g. <code>kTCCServiceSystemPolicyAllFiles</code>, <code>kTCCServiceMicrophone</code>, <code>kTCCServiceScreenCapture</code>).</li>
<li><strong><code>client</code>:</strong> The bundle identifier or absolute path of the client.</li>
<li><strong><code>client_type</code>:</strong> Indicates whether <code>client</code> is interpreted as a bundle ID (<code>0</code>) or path (<code>1</code>).</li>
<li><strong><code>auth_value</code>:</strong> Encodes the decision (e.g. <code>0</code> = Denied, <code>1</code> = Unknown / Prompt, <code>2</code> = Allowed, <code>3</code> = Limited).</li>
<li><strong><code>csreq</code>:</strong> A compiled <strong>Code Signing Requirement (CSReq)</strong> used to bind the decision to a particular identity, not just a path string.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional columns (timestamps, indirect attribution fields, categories) vary by OS release, but these fields form the stable core.</p>
<p><strong>The <code>csreq</code> Blob: Cryptographic Anchor</strong></p>
<p>TCC does <strong>not</strong> trust filesystem paths alone. Instead:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>When a request arrives, <code>tccd</code> obtains the process’s code signing information (via <code>csops</code> or similar APIs).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It evaluates whether the <strong>current code signature</strong> satisfies the stored <code>csreq</code> expression from the database row:</p>
<pre><code>(Current_Code_Signature) satisfies (Stored_CSReq)
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the check fails (for example, the app was re-signed with a different certificate), existing permissions do not apply, and a new prompt may be triggered or access denied.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This prevents an attacker from overwriting <code>/Applications/TrustedApp.app</code> with malware and inheriting its camera or disk permissions.</p>
<p><strong>Protection Mechanisms</strong></p>
<p>Although the TCC databases are ordinary SQLite files, access to them is tightly controlled:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>SIP Protection:</strong> The system TCC database is protected by SIP; direct modifications are blocked for all but a handful of Apple-signed components with special entitlements (including <code>tccd</code> itself).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>MAC / Data Vaults:</strong> On newer macOS versions, the directory containing TCC databases can be part of a <strong>Data Vault</strong>, requiring specific entitlements just to traverse or open the directory and files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Exclusive Control by <code>tccd</code>:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>tccd</code> maintains long-lived connections and can hold locks on the database.</li>
<li>Attempts to modify the file on disk directly (for example, via <code>sqlite3</code> under a disabled SIP configuration) often lead to integrity check failures, after which <code>tccd</code> may restore the database from a backup or recover via WAL semantics.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>RE Focus: The <code>tccutil</code> Fallacy</strong></p>
<p>The <code>tccutil</code> command-line utility behaves as a client of TCC, not a raw database editor:</p>
<ul>
<li>It communicates with <code>tccd</code> via XPC to request resets or clears.</li>
<li>It does not write to <code>TCC.db</code> directly.</li>
</ul>
<p>For reverse engineering:</p>
<ul>
<li>Observing XPC traffic between <code>tccutil</code> and <code>tccd</code> yields the supported operations and their internal names.</li>
<li>Direct tampering with <code>TCC.db</code> is fragile and often counterproductive; intercepting or simulating <code>tccd</code>’s own XPC interfaces is more robust.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="932-the-attribution-chain-determining-who-is-asking">9.3.2 The Attribution Chain: Determining <em>Who</em> Is Asking</h4>
<p>The hardest problem TCC solves is <strong>Attribution</strong>. When an action flows through multiple processes, which one should be considered the “client” for consent purposes?</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>A GUI app that launches a helper tool to touch the camera.</li>
<li>A terminal running a shell script that launches <code>curl</code> or a Python interpreter.</li>
<li>A background agent performing work on behalf of a signed, user-facing app.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The XPC Audit Token</strong></p>
<p>When a message arrives at <code>tccd</code> (for example, over <code>com.apple.tccd.system</code> or <code>com.apple.tccd</code>):</p>
<ul>
<li>The Mach message carries an <strong>audit token</strong> in its trailer.</li>
<li><code>tccd</code> extracts PID, UID, GID, and audit attributes from this token.</li>
<li>It uses the kernel’s code-signing interfaces (<code>csops</code>, <code>CS_VALID</code> flags) to resolve the token to an actual, signed binary on disk.</li>
</ul>
<p>The audit token is provided by the kernel and cannot be forged by userland, making it the primary identity anchor.</p>
<p><strong>The “Responsible Process” Problem</strong></p>
<p>Attribution is not always identical to the immediate caller:</p>
<ul>
<li>For <code>Terminal.app</code> running <code>curl</code>, the <em>responsible</em> entity for a network or disk access may be considered <code>Terminal.app</code>, not <code>curl</code>.</li>
<li>For automation or helper tools, a background daemon might act on behalf of a user-facing app.</li>
</ul>
<p>To handle this, TCC models an <strong>Attribution Chain</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong><code>responsible_pid</code> and Relationship Tracking</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Launch services, XPC, and higher-level frameworks can mark another process as the “responsible” one (for example, via launch configuration or XPC flags).</li>
<li><code>tccd</code> verifies that the relationship between caller and responsible process is legitimate (parent–child, session, or entitlement-based).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Access Object Construction</strong></p>
<p>Internally, <code>tccd</code> constructs a conceptual <code>TCCAccessRequest</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Subject:</strong> The process issuing the request (the immediate caller).</li>
<li><strong>Accessor:</strong> The process that will actually interact with the resource (often equal to the subject).</li>
<li><strong>Attributor:</strong> The process that should be presented to the user in UI and used as the key in the database.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Decision Logic</strong></p>
<p>Roughly:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the caller has a private entitlement such as <code>com.apple.private.tcc.allow</code> for the requested service, access is granted without user interaction.</li>
<li>Otherwise, TCC looks for an existing row in <code>TCC.db</code> for the attributor and service (using <code>csreq</code> matching).</li>
<li>If no row exists, <code>tccd</code> triggers a user prompt.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Secure UI</strong></p>
<p>TCC prompts are not drawn by the requesting client:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>tccd</code> delegates UI to system agents such as <code>UserNotificationCenter</code> / <code>CoreServicesUIAgent</code>.</li>
<li>Prompts are shown in elevated WindowServer layers that the client cannot fully control or overlay, mitigating clickjacking and fake consent dialogs.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="933-re-focus-xpc-attacks-against-tcc-endpoint-validation">9.3.3 RE Focus: XPC Attacks against TCC Endpoint Validation</h4>
<p>From a vulnerability research perspective, <code>tccd</code> is a high-value target. Gaining the ability to impersonate a trusted client (such as <code>Finder.app</code>) can yield Full Disk Access or other sensitive capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Attack Vector 1: XPC Injection into Trusted Clients</strong></p>
<p>Many TCC-permitted apps are extensible:</p>
<ul>
<li>They load bundles or plugins via <code>dlopen</code>.</li>
<li>They may allow scripting or untrusted content with code execution.</li>
</ul>
<p>If an attacker injects code into such a process:</p>
<ul>
<li>That code runs <strong>inside</strong> the trusted PID.</li>
<li>TCC continues to see the trusted app’s identity and grants access based on its existing permissions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mitigations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hardened Runtime</strong> and <strong>Library Validation</strong> (enforced by AMFI and <code>dyld</code> in cooperation with TXM) prevent loading unsigned or unentitled libraries into hardened processes.</li>
<li>However, any app with <code>com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation</code> or similar entitlements remains a potential carrier for this class of attack.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Attack Vector 2: Fake Attributors and XPC Payload Spoofing</strong></p>
<p>Earlier macOS versions were more trusting of client-supplied metadata in XPC messages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some TCC code paths accepted an explicit “target token” or attribution fields from the client’s XPC dictionary.</li>
<li>Attackers could attempt to supply a forged <code>target_token</code> that pointed to a more privileged app.</li>
</ul>
<p>Modern TCC has hardened this:</p>
<ul>
<li>For most services, <code>tccd</code> ignores user-provided tokens in XPC payloads.</li>
<li>It trusts only the kernel-supplied audit token from the Mach message trailer and reconstructs attribution from kernel state and entitlement checks.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Attack Vector 3: Semantic Confusion via Automation (AppleEvents, <code>open</code>, etc.)</strong></p>
<p>An attacker can attempt to coerce a privileged app into performing an action:</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, using AppleEvents or the <code>open</code> command to cause <code>Terminal</code> or another privileged app to run a script or open a sensitive file.</li>
<li>If the privileged app is the attributor in TCC’s view, its permissions are leveraged by the attacker’s payload.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mitigations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automation permissions</strong> such as <code>kTCCServiceAppleEvents</code> gate which apps can send AppleEvents to which targets.</li>
<li><code>tccd</code> tracks automation relationships and often requires separate consent for one app to control another.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Tahoe Impact: Hardware-Anchored Identity</strong></p>
<p>On Apple Silicon with Tahoe-class hardware:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>TCC depends on code-signing identity and hardened runtime flags obtained from the kernel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those, in turn, are anchored in TXM and SPTM:</p>
<ul>
<li>TXM controls executable mappings and trust caches.</li>
<li>SPTM enforces that the kernel’s view of code identity cannot be arbitrarily rewritten via page-table manipulation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Consequences:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A kernel attacker who sets <code>CS_VALID</code> bits in process credentials without correspondingly convincing TXM risks creating a state where pages will not be executable or are killed on use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TCC’s reliance on code identity is therefore backed by a hardware root of trust: subtly altering TCC decisions still requires either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Subverting <code>tccd</code>’s logic (via XPC or parsing bugs), or</li>
<li>Subverting the TXM/SPTM path that defines which CDHashes are trustworthy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Even under kernel compromise, forging the identity of a high-value system binary that TCC trusts is significantly more complex than on pre-SPTM systems; the identity must be consistent from the userland view, the kernel’s credentials, and the secure-world trust caches.</p>
<h2 id="100-user-session-authentication-data-protection">10.0 User Session, Authentication &amp; Data Protection</h2>
<p>The transition from the system bootstrap phase to the interactive user session represents a critical boundary crossing. Up to this point, the system has operated primarily in the <code>Startup</code> domain, managed by the root <code>launchd</code> context. The instantiation of a user session requires the creation of a new security context—the <strong>Audit Session</strong>—and the decryption of user-specific cryptographic material anchored in the Secure Enclave.</p>
<p>In the Tahoe architecture, this process is no longer a simple comparison of a password hash against a file. It is a hardware-mediated ceremony involving:</p>
<ul>
<li>Evaluation of the user’s credentials via <strong>Open Directory</strong> and the <strong>Shadow Hash</strong> store.</li>
<li>Unlocking of a SEP-protected per-user secret that underpins the <strong>Secure Token</strong> / FileVault authorization model.</li>
<li>Derivation or unwrapping of the <strong>User Keybag</strong> inside the SEP.</li>
<li>Establishment of a local Kerberos identity (via the Local KDC / LKDC) for those services that participate in single sign-on, with the initial credentials ultimately rooted in secrets that are only accessible after the SEP has accepted the login.</li>
</ul>
<p>Biometrics (Touch ID, Face ID, Optic ID) do not replace the password; they conditionally authorize the Secure Enclave to perform cryptographic operations—such as unwrapping key material—that would otherwise require manual secret entry.</p>
<h3 id="101-loginwindow-opendirectoryd">10.1 <code>loginwindow</code> &amp; <code>opendirectoryd</code></h3>
<p>The graphical login experience is orchestrated by two primary userland components:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>loginwindow</code></strong> – Manages the session lifecycle and login UI, coordinates shield windows, and drives the state machine for login / logout / fast user switching.</li>
<li><strong><code>opendirectoryd</code></strong> – Provides the abstraction layer for authentication and identity services, loading plugins to speak to local, LDAP, and Active Directory nodes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both components have lineage back to NeXTSTEP, but their internals have been aggressively refactored to support the hardware-backed security model of Apple Silicon and the Tahoe boot chain.</p>
<h4 id="1011-the-audit-session-id-asid-and-kernel-tracking">10.1.1 The Audit Session ID (ASID) and Kernel Tracking</h4>
<p>In XNU, the concept of a “User” in the sense of a <strong>login instance</strong> is tracked via the <strong>Audit Session ID (ASID)</strong>. This is distinct from the UNIX UID/GID:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>UID/GID</strong> – Identify principals in the traditional POSIX sense.</li>
<li><strong>ASID</strong> – Identifies a specific authenticated session (e.g. physical console login, fast user switch slot, SSH login, screen sharing session).</li>
</ul>
<p>Every process in the system carries an <code>audit_token_t</code> which encodes, among other fields, the ASID of the session under which it is running.</p>
<p><strong>The <code>setaudit_addr</code> syscall</strong></p>
<p>When <code>loginwindow</code> successfully authenticates a user, it does not simply <code>setuid</code>. It calls into the BSM audit stack via the <code>setaudit_addr</code> syscall (typically through <code>libbsm</code> wrappers):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Kernel structure:</strong> The syscall populates the <code>auditinfo_addr</code> state, from which <code>audit_token_t</code> values are derived for that process.</li>
<li><strong>Inheritance:</strong> Children inherit their parent’s ASID in much the same way they inherit UID/GID.</li>
<li><strong>Mutability constraints:</strong> Changing an ASID after it has been established is tightly controlled. In practice, only a small set of privileged components (e.g. <code>loginwindow</code>, <code>sshd</code>) can create or reassign audit sessions, and they do so under private entitlements discovered via reverse engineering rather than public API.</li>
</ul>
<p>For almost all processes, the ASID behaves as a write-once attribute: it is set when the session is created and then propagated down the process tree.</p>
<p><strong>ASID as a Console Ownership signal</strong></p>
<p>The ASID acts as a primary signal for “Console Ownership” in several subsystems:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>TCC / <code>tccd</code>:</strong><br>
Access-control decisions for sensors such as Camera and Microphone are made in the context of an audit token. When a process requests, for example, Camera access, <code>tccd</code> evaluates whether the request comes from the ASID associated with the active graphical console. Foreground sessions see prompts; non-console sessions (e.g. SSH) are generally denied or handled differently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>WindowServer / SkyLight:</strong><br>
Only processes that belong to the active console ASID are permitted to establish the full, interactive connection to the WindowServer required to draw on the screen. Other ASIDs may be confined to offscreen rendering, remote sessions, or be blocked entirely.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This makes the ASID a crucial anchor for reasoning about which processes are “actually in front of the user” in the Tahoe user-session model.</p>
<p><strong>RE Focus: <code>security_authtrampoline</code> and launchd domains</strong></p>
<p>Historically, the transition from the <code>loginwindow</code> context (running as root) to the user context involved a setuid helper binary, <code>security_authtrampoline</code>, which mediated the handoff of credentials and environment to a <strong>per-user <code>/sbin/launchd</code> process</strong>. That design existed in earlier OS X releases, where each logged-in user had their own <code>launchd</code> instance.</p>
<p>Modern macOS (including Tahoe) uses a different model:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There is a <strong>single <code>launchd</code> process (PID 1)</strong> for the entire system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instead of spawning separate <code>launchd</code> processes per user, <code>launchd</code> manages multiple <strong>domains</strong> in its bootstrap namespace:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>system domain</strong> for LaunchDaemons.</li>
<li><strong>User domains</strong> keyed by UID (e.g. <code>user/501/</code>).</li>
<li><strong>Login/session domains</strong> keyed by ASID (e.g. <code>login/ASID/</code> or <code>session/ASID/</code>).</li>
<li>GUI domains (e.g. <code>gui/UID/</code>) that correspond to interactive consoles.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>On successful authentication, <code>loginwindow</code> now:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Uses private XPC/session APIs (e.g. <code>xpc_session_create</code> and related calls, as observed via reverse engineering) to ask the <strong>system <code>launchd</code> (PID 1)</strong> to create or activate:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>user domain</strong> for the authenticated UID.</li>
<li>A <strong>login/session domain</strong> keyed by the newly established ASID.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Binds that login domain to the new Audit Session:</p>
<ul>
<li>New user processes launched for the session are started in this login domain.</li>
<li>Their <code>audit_token_t</code> values reflect both the user’s UID and the new ASID.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>From this point of view:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>login domain</strong> in <code>launchd</code> becomes the <strong>logical root</strong> of the user’s process tree for that session (services, agents, apps), but:</p>
<ul>
<li>All of these processes are still ultimately descendants of the <strong>single PID-1 <code>launchd</code></strong>.</li>
<li>There is no separate “User <code>launchd</code>” process in modern macOS; only per-user/per-session <strong>domains</strong> inside the global <code>launchd</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For reverse engineers, the key observation points are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tracking how <code>loginwindow</code> transitions from “no session” to “new ASID + new login domain”.</li>
<li>Enumerating <code>launchd</code> jobs in the relevant <code>user/</code> and <code>login/</code> namespaces to reconstruct the user’s process lattice for a given ASID.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="1012-loginwindow-the-shield-window-and-session-state">10.1.2 <code>loginwindow</code>: The Shield Window and Session State</h4>
<p><code>loginwindow</code> (at <code>/System/Library/CoreServices/loginwindow.app/Contents/MacOS/loginwindow</code>) is the session leader for the console. It:</p>
<ul>
<li>Draws the login UI and lock screen.</li>
<li>Negotiates authentication with <code>opendirectoryd</code> and Kerberos components.</li>
<li>Manages fast user switching and logout.</li>
<li>Maintains the “Shield Window” that sits above all userland UI during sensitive phases.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Shield Window (anti-overlay)</strong></p>
<p>To prevent “fake login” and clickjacking attacks in which a malicious application draws a visually perfect imitation of the login screen to steal credentials, <code>loginwindow</code> uses a privileged connection to <strong>SkyLight</strong> (the WindowServer framework):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Window level:</strong> The login UI is drawn at or near <code>kCGShieldingWindowLevel</code>, a reserved Z-order used by the system for modalities like login, lock, and screen dimming overlays.</li>
<li><strong>Exclusive event routing:</strong> While the Shield Window is active, the WindowServer routes all keyboard and pointer events exclusively to <code>loginwindow</code>. Background applications may still be composited but do not receive input, even if their windows visually overlap or mimic the login UI.</li>
<li><strong>Console focus:</strong> The Shield Window is tied to the active console ASID, so remote or background sessions cannot legitimately persist a shield that captures events intended for the physical user.</li>
</ul>
<p>For RE work, confirming input exclusivity via event taps is a good sanity check that the shielded state is active.</p>
<p><strong>The State Machine</strong></p>
<p><code>loginwindow</code> implements a substantial state machine driven by:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AppleEvents:</strong> Legacy IPC paths that still orchestrate parts of the login / logout choreography and client notifications.</li>
<li><strong>Darwin Notifications / XPC:</strong> Modern notification mechanisms for coordinating with <code>opendirectoryd</code>, <code>launchd</code>, and system services.</li>
</ul>
<p>Relevant legacy hooks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>LoginHook</code> / <code>LogoutHook</code>:</strong><br>
While officially deprecated, the underlying code paths remain. They are surrounded by modern sandboxing and hardened runtime checks, but they still provide observable transitions around session start / end.</li>
</ul>
<p>Session state persistence:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Resume / Transparent App Lifecycle (TAL):</strong><br>
<code>loginwindow</code> participates in the “Resume” feature (re-opening windows after reboot or logout). State is persisted across:</p>
<ul>
<li>Per-host preferences such as <code>~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.loginwindow.*.plist</code>.</li>
<li>Per-application saved state under <code>~/Library/Saved Application State/</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>These artifacts are protected by the user’s Data Protection keys and provide a rich post-mortem surface for reconstructing session evolution.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="1013-opendirectoryd-the-authentication-broker">10.1.3 <code>opendirectoryd</code>: The Authentication Broker</h4>
<p><code>opendirectoryd</code> is the daemon responsible for answering the question: <strong>“Are these credentials valid for this identity?”</strong> It is a modular daemon that loads plugins (bundles) to handle different directory services: local, LDAP, Active Directory, and more.</p>
<p><strong>The Local Node (<code>/Local/Default</code>)</strong></p>
<p>On a standalone Mac, authentication is handled by the <strong>Local Node</strong>, whose data store lives under:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>/var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Within this node:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Users</strong> are stored as individual property list (<code>.plist</code>) files under <code>users/</code>.</li>
<li>These plists contain metadata (name, UID, group memberships, secure token flags, etc.) but not directly the password hash.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Shadow Hash Data</strong></p>
<p>The actual password verifier is stored as <strong>Shadow Hash</strong> data:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The user plist typically contains a <code>ShadowHashData</code> key whose value is a binary blob.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Analysis of these blobs shows:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>SALTED-SHA512-PBKDF2</strong> representation of the password for compatibility with older flows and offline verification scenarios.</li>
<li>Additional structured fields used by Apple’s modern authentication path, including material that is only meaningful in combination with the Secure Enclave and device-specific secrets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the Tahoe-era architecture, it is useful to conceptually treat part of this blob as a <strong>SEP-wrapped per-user secret</strong> that participates in FileVault and keybag unlock. Apple does not publish the internal structure of <code>ShadowHashData</code>, but reverse engineering strongly indicates that the blob contains more than a conventional hash.</p>
<p><strong>Verification Flow (<code>ODRecordVerifyPassword</code>)</strong></p>
<p>When <code>loginwindow</code> submits a password to <code>opendirectoryd</code> for a local account, the flow roughly looks like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Directory lookup:</strong><br>
<code>opendirectoryd</code> uses its Local Node plugin to locate the user record and retrieve the associated <code>ShadowHashData</code> blob.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hash verification:</strong><br>
The SALTED-SHA512-PBKDF2 component can be verified locally to confidently reject obviously wrong passwords without involving the SEP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Secure Enclave mediation:</strong><br>
For FileVault-enabled accounts and for modern secure-token flows, <code>opendirectoryd</code> (via lower layers in the stack) invokes the <strong>AppleSEPKeyStore</strong> interface in the kernel:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The candidate password and the relevant wrapped secret(s) derived from <code>ShadowHashData</code> are marshalled to the kernel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The kernel forwards this to the SEP over the mailbox channel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The SEP combines:</p>
<ul>
<li>The device’s <strong>UID key</strong> (fused in hardware, never leaving the SEP).</li>
<li>A KDF over the password and salt.</li>
<li>Policy- and measurement-dependent state (e.g. SKP).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The SEP attempts to “unwrap” the per-user secret and, if successful, signals success and may derive additional keys for keybag and FileVault operations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Result propagation:</strong><br>
<code>opendirectoryd</code> treats SEP success as authoritative for those modern flows. A failure at this stage typically manifests as an authentication error even if the legacy PBKDF2 hash alone would have been satisfied.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>RE Implication</strong></p>
<p>This architecture has two important consequences:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Password hashes vs. device-bound keys:</strong><br>
Extracting <code>ShadowHashData</code> allows offline cracking of the PBKDF2-SHA512 password hash, but recovering the password does <strong>not</strong> by itself reconstruct the FileVault Volume Encryption Key (VEK) or class keys. Those require the SEP, UID key, and SKP-bound material.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Device specificity:</strong><br>
The secrets that actually unlock user data are bound to the specific Secure Enclave instance that created them. Moving Shadow Hash material to another Mac does not make that user’s FileVault-protected data decryptable without further compromise.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>From a red-team perspective, this forces attacks toward live credential interception (before the password is sent into the verification pipeline) or SEP compromise, rather than traditional offline hash cracking for disk decryption.</p>
<h4 id="1014-kerberos-and-the-local-kdc-heimdal">10.1.4 Kerberos and the Local KDC (Heimdal)</h4>
<p>Modern macOS systems ship with a <strong>Heimdal Kerberos</strong> stack and, by default, support a <strong>Local Key Distribution Center (LKDC)</strong>. The LKDC provides Kerberized identities for local services and is integrated with Open Directory.</p>
<p><strong>Why Kerberos on a standalone Mac?</strong></p>
<p>Kerberos avoids passing plaintext passwords around systemwide. Instead:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Initial login (when Kerberos is configured):</strong><br>
Once the user’s credentials have been accepted (potentially via SEP-mediated verification), the system can obtain a <strong>Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT)</strong> from the LKDC corresponding to that account. This step is conditional: non-Kerberized setups or purely local workflows may omit it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Credential cache:</strong><br>
Kerberos tickets are stored in a credential cache managed by the system (kernel and userland helpers), typically accessed via the standard <code>KRB5CCNAME</code> / CCAPI plumbing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Service authentication:</strong><br>
When the user interacts with Kerberized services (e.g. Screen Sharing, some system preference panes, local file services, AD-backed services), the client obtains a <strong>service ticket</strong> from the LKDC and presents it to the target service instead of resending the password.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Validation:</strong><br>
Services validate the Kerberos ticket and enforce their own authorization logic.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Smart Card and PKINIT</strong></p>
<p>In higher-assurance environments:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Smart cards or platform PIV tokens (backed by the Secure Enclave) are used instead of passwords.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kerberos uses <strong>PKINIT</strong> to validate an X.509 certificate chain, mapping it to a Kerberos principal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tahoe’s hardened boot and driver model ensures that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The smart card driver stack (often running as a driver extension, <code>dext</code>) is validated and measured under TXM/LocalPolicy.</li>
<li>Certificates and private keys used for PKINIT are only accessible after SEP policy checks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>RE Focus: <code>Heimdal.framework</code></strong></p>
<p>The private <code>Heimdal.framework</code> contains the glue between <code>loginwindow</code>, <code>opendirectoryd</code>, and the Kerberos stack:</p>
<ul>
<li>Functions like <code>krb5_get_init_creds_password</code> remain useful RE chokepoints for observing when and how plaintext credentials are turned into Kerberos tickets.</li>
<li>Hooking these paths requires bypassing SIP and the hardened runtime and is therefore squarely in the “post-exploitation / lab” category rather than a practical on-disk modification target.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="102-biometric-unlock-touch-id-face-id-optic-id">10.2 Biometric Unlock (Touch ID / Face ID / Optic ID)</h3>
<p>Biometric authentication on Apple platforms is frequently misunderstood as a replacement for the passcode or password. Architecturally, it is a <strong>convenience mechanism</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Biometrics never replace the underlying secret; they authorize the Secure Enclave to perform a cryptographic operation that would otherwise require manual entry of that secret.</li>
<li>The SEP decides whether biometric factors are currently acceptable (policy, backoff, recent passcode use, secure intent).</li>
<li>On success, the SEP unlocks or derives specific keys and returns opaque handles or tokens to the OS.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the Tahoe architecture, the biometric stack is an interplay between:</p>
<ul>
<li>Userland daemons (<code>coreauthd</code>, <code>biometrickitd</code>).</li>
<li>Kernel drivers (<code>AppleBiometricSensor</code>, Local Authentication hooks).</li>
<li>The Secure Enclave.</li>
<li>For Face ID and Optic ID: the <strong>Secure Neural Engine (SNE)</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="1021-the-daemon-hierarchy-coreauthd-%E2%86%92-biometrickitd-%E2%86%92-sep">10.2.1 The Daemon Hierarchy: <code>coreauthd</code> → <code>biometrickitd</code> → SEP</h4>
<p>The implementation is split across two main daemons to enforce separation of concerns:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><code>coreauthd</code> – Policy</strong><br>
Located at<br>
<code>/System/Library/Frameworks/LocalAuthentication.framework/Support/coreauthd</code>,<br>
it implements the system’s Local Authentication policy engine:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manages <code>LAContext</code> instances and associates them with PIDs, ASIDs, and calling processes.</li>
<li>Parses Keychain Access Control Lists (ACLs), evaluating requirements such as “biometry OR passcode” vs “biometry AND device unlock”.</li>
<li>Implements the <strong>Access Control Module (ACM)</strong> logic that mirrors SEP-side decision structures: it constructs and validates the requests that will eventually be sent to the Secure Enclave.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>biometrickitd</code> – Mechanism</strong><br>
Located at <code>/usr/libexec/biometrickitd</code>, it manages the physical biometric sensors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sensor abstraction:</strong> Loads device-specific plugins (e.g. Mesa for Touch ID, Pearl for Face ID, Jade for Optic ID).</li>
<li><strong>Power / state management:</strong> Controls sensor power, exposure, illumination hardware, and readiness.</li>
<li><strong>Data relay:</strong> Sets up shared buffers or DMA configurations between the sensor hardware and the Secure Enclave via the kernel. It does not perform high-level biometric matching; it shuttles encrypted sensor output toward the SEP.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Handshake</strong></p>
<p>A typical biometric request flows as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>An app invokes <code>-[LAContext evaluatePolicy:localizedReason:reply:]</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>coreauthd</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Validates the caller’s code signature, entitlements, and audit token (including ASID).</li>
<li>Checks Keychain or system ACLs to decide whether biometry is acceptable for this operation.</li>
<li>Creates an <code>ACMContext</code> structure representing this auth attempt.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>coreauthd</code> sends an XPC request to <code>biometrickitd</code> to <strong>arm</strong> the appropriate sensor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>biometrickitd</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Issues <code>IOConnectCall*</code> requests into the biometric kernel driver (<code>AppleBiometricSensor</code> and relatives).</li>
<li>The driver configures the sensor and a buffer that is shared with or visible to the Secure Enclave.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The kernel signals the SEP via the mailbox that a biometric capture session is ready and provides the buffer references.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>At that point, the SEP takes over capture, matching, and decision logic; userland daemons observe state transitions and present UI, but never see raw biometric templates.</p>
<h4 id="1022-the-hardware-path-sensor-to-sep-pairing">10.2.2 The Hardware Path: Sensor-to-SEP Pairing</h4>
<p>A critical security property of the biometric stack is <strong>hardware pairing</strong> between the sensor module and the Secure Enclave.</p>
<p><strong>Factory pairing</strong></p>
<p>During manufacturing and repair-authorization procedures:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The biometric sensor module (Touch ID button, TrueDepth camera system, Optic ID array) and the SEP perform a pairing protocol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A shared secret is established and stored:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the sensor’s controller.</li>
<li>In SEP-managed internal storage (e.g. xART).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Encrypted channel</strong></p>
<p>When a biometric capture occurs:</p>
<ol>
<li>The sensor acquires raw data (fingerprint ridge map, IR depth map, iris texture).</li>
<li>The sensor hardware encrypts this data using keys derived from the pairing secret before putting it on the bus.</li>
<li>The encrypted payload travels over SPI/MIPI to the Application Processor.</li>
<li>The biometric kernel driver writes the encrypted blob into a region of memory that is readable by the SEP.</li>
<li>The SEP reads the blob, decrypts it using the pairing key, and performs all further processing internally.</li>
</ol>
<p>From the AP’s perspective, these buffers contain high-entropy ciphertext. Dumping them from the kernel or an I/O trace yields no usable biometric image data.</p>
<p><strong>RE Implication</strong></p>
<p>Two empirically observable consequences:</p>
<ul>
<li>Swapping a Touch ID or Face ID module between devices without running Apple’s pairing tools causes biometric functions to fail: the SEP can no longer decrypt sensor output.</li>
<li>Hooking the biometric driver stack and dumping in-flight data shows encrypted blobs rather than structured images, confirming that matching happens exclusively inside the SEP / SNE domain.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="1023-the-secure-neural-engine-sne-optic-id">10.2.3 The Secure Neural Engine (SNE) &amp; Optic ID</h4>
<p>Face ID and Optic ID push biometric matching beyond the capabilities of the general-purpose SEP core. To handle these workloads, Apple partitions the <strong>Neural Engine (ANE)</strong> into:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>standard mode</strong> – accessible to userland via Core ML.</li>
<li>A <strong>secure mode</strong> – a slice reserved for the Secure Enclave, sometimes referred to as the Secure Neural Engine (SNE).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Optic ID Flow (Tahoe / Vision Pro)</strong></p>
<p>At a high level, an Optic ID authentication proceeds as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Capture:</strong><br>
The dedicated Optic ID cameras capture spatiotemporally modulated IR images of the user’s eyes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Encrypted transfer:</strong><br>
As with Touch ID and Face ID, the raw frames are encrypted at the sensor and written as ciphertext into memory visible to the SEP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SNE setup:</strong><br>
The SEP:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensures that the portion of the Neural Engine allocated for secure use is scrubbed and placed under the control of its memory protection regime.</li>
<li>Loads the Optic ID neural network model and associated parameters.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Feature extraction:</strong><br>
The SEP feeds the encrypted image data through the secure ANE slice:</p>
<ul>
<li>The SNE produces feature vectors representing the iris and surrounding structures.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Template matching:</strong><br>
The SEP compares the feature vector against stored templates in its <strong>Secure Storage Component</strong> (xART-backed), applying thresholds, quality checks, and policy (user presence, recent activity, etc.).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liveness detection:</strong><br>
In parallel, the SEP uses the spatiotemporal pattern of IR illumination and pupil response to distinguish live tissue from static imagery or contact-lens attacks.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Memory protection</strong></p>
<p>On recent Apple Silicon generations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The memory used for SEP-private and SEP–SNE-shared computations is protected by the Secure Enclave’s <strong>Memory Protection Engine</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Observers outside the SEP domain (including the AP and hypervisors) see encrypted and authenticated data when they attempt to read those regions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This ensures that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Biometric templates and intermediate neural activations never appear in plaintext outside the Secure Enclave trust boundary.</li>
<li>Dumping DRAM does not expose Optic ID templates or models in a directly usable form.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="1024-secure-intent-the-gpio-hardline">10.2.4 Secure Intent: The GPIO Hardline</h4>
<p>For high-value transactions (Apple Pay, high-assurance key operations), Apple requires more than “biometric match.” Malware could, in principle, trick the user into satisfying a biometric prompt while a hidden transaction is in flight.</p>
<p>To address this, Apple implements <strong>Secure Intent</strong> as a physical side channel into the SEP.</p>
<p><strong>The physical control</strong></p>
<p>On supported devices:</p>
<ul>
<li>The side/top/power button is wired not only to the Application Processor and Always-On Processor (AOP), but also via a dedicated signal path to the Secure Enclave.</li>
<li>This signal path allows the SEP to independently observe specific button gestures (e.g. double-click).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The logic</strong></p>
<p>When a transaction is marked as requiring secure intent (via LocalAuthentication / Apple Pay policy):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The SEP performs the biometric match as usual.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On success, instead of immediately unwrapping or signing with the relevant key, the SEP:</p>
<ul>
<li>Records that a biometric match is pending for a secure-intent operation.</li>
<li>Starts a short internal timer window.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The SEP monitors its dedicated button line for the required gesture (e.g. double-click within a given time bound).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only if both conditions are satisfied:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recent acceptable biometric match.</li>
<li>Correct physical button gesture within the window.<br>
does the SEP:</li>
<li>Release the Apple Pay token.</li>
<li>Unwrap or use the key required for the operation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>RE Focus</strong></p>
<p>From an attacker’s perspective:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>UI spoofing (e.g. drawing a fake “Double Click to Pay” overlay via <code>WindowServer</code>) cannot produce the electrical signal on the SEP’s dedicated line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even full compromise of the AP and WindowServer stack cannot bypass secure intent without either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inducing the user to perform the real physical gesture at the right time, or</li>
<li>Compromising the SEP itself.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="1025-the-local-authentication-context-lac-and-token-binding">10.2.5 The Local Authentication Context (LAC) and Token Binding</h4>
<p>When authentication succeeds, the SEP does not simply return <code>true</code> / <code>false</code>. It returns or maintains <strong>cryptographic context</strong> that is later used to authorize specific operations.</p>
<p><strong><code>ACMHandle</code> and context</strong></p>
<p>Internally, <code>coreauthd</code> and related components track an opaque handle (often modeled as an <code>ACMHandle</code>) associated with:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The LAContext created for the app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The SEP’s record of:</p>
<ul>
<li>The factor that succeeded (passcode vs. biometry).</li>
<li>The time of the auth.</li>
<li>Relevant policy state (device lock state, secure intent, etc.).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This handle is then passed to other system components that need to prove “recent successful user presence” without re-prompting.</p>
<p><strong>Keychain and token binding</strong></p>
<p>For a Keychain item protected by <code>kSecAccessControlUserPresence</code> or a similar policy:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The client invokes a Keychain operation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>securityd</code> (the Keychain daemon) verifies that it has a suitable <code>ACMHandle</code> or triggers <code>coreauthd</code> to obtain one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>securityd</code> sends:</p>
<ul>
<li>The encrypted keyblob (wrapped key).</li>
<li>The <code>ACMHandle</code> or equivalent context.<br>
to the SEP.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inside the SEP:</p>
<ul>
<li>The handle is checked for validity and freshness (time bounds, lock state, backoff).</li>
<li>If valid, the SEP uses its internal keys to unwrap the keyblob.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Depending on the item’s protection:</p>
<ul>
<li>The unwrapped key may be returned to <code>securityd</code> (for extractable keys).</li>
<li>Or the SEP may perform the cryptographic operation internally (for non-extractable keys).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In all cases, the AP never gains the ability to “forge” recent user presence; it can only present handles that the SEP previously issued.</p>
<p><strong>Backoff and retry policy</strong></p>
<p>The SEP enforces retry and lockout policy in hardware:</p>
<ul>
<li>Failed biometric attempts increment counters stored in SEP-protected storage (e.g. xART).</li>
<li>After a small number of failures, delays are introduced between attempts.</li>
<li>After a bounded number of failures (e.g. five for Face ID / Touch ID), biometric authentication is disabled until the user enters the passcode or password.</li>
<li>Time-based rules (such as requiring a passcode after a certain period since last unlock or since last passcode entry) are also enforced by SEP logic rather than the AP.</li>
</ul>
<p>The exact thresholds and timing are encoded in <code>sepOS</code> and evolve across OS generations, but the important property is that they are <strong>not</strong> under kernel or userland control.</p>
<h3 id="103-data-protection-filevault">10.3 Data Protection &amp; FileVault</h3>
<p>On Intel Macs, FileVault was implemented as a distinct full-disk encryption layer (CoreStorage) that sat below the filesystem. On Apple Silicon, this layering has collapsed into a unified <strong>Data Protection</strong> model:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every file on the APFS volume is encrypted with a per-file key.</li>
<li>Per-file keys are wrapped by <strong>class keys</strong>.</li>
<li>Class keys are stored in <strong>keybags</strong> that are managed by the Secure Enclave.</li>
<li>“Turning on FileVault” primarily changes how the <strong>Volume Encryption Key (VEK)</strong> is protected: from “effectively UID-only” to “UID plus user secret (password) and system measurement (SKP).”</li>
</ul>
<p>In macOS Tahoe, the Data Protection model from iOS is carried over almost verbatim and extended with Mac-specific SKP and policy machinery.</p>
<h4 id="1031-unwrapping-the-user-keybag-the-class-key-hierarchy">10.3.1 Unwrapping the User Keybag: The Class Key Hierarchy</h4>
<p>The central on-disk structure for Data Protection is the <strong>Keybag</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A binary property list stored in system-managed locations (paths vary with OS releases and boot volume layout).</li>
<li>Contains <strong>wrapped class keys</strong> and metadata.</li>
<li>Is always consumed by the SEP; the kernel never sees cleartext class keys.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hierarchy</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Hardware UID (UID key):</strong><br>
A device-unique AES key, fused into the Secure Enclave and never exposed outside it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>User password / passcode:</strong><br>
The logical secret known to the user and entered at login or unlock time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Passcode-derived key (PDK):</strong><br>
The SEP mixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A KDF over the password plus salt (PBKDF2-like).</li>
<li>The UID key.</li>
<li>Policy-dependent inputs (e.g. SKP measurement).<br>
Conceptually:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>PDK = Tangle( UID, PBKDF2(password, salt), measurement, policy )
</code></pre>
<p>The exact KDF and tangling function are implementation details, but the key property is: PDK cannot be derived off-device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Class Keys:</strong><br>
The keybag stores wrapped class keys corresponding to the Data Protection classes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Class A (“Complete Protection”):</strong><br>
Data only accessible while the device is unlocked. Keys are evicted from SEP memory when the device locks.</li>
<li><strong>Class B (“Protected Unless Open”):</strong><br>
Similar to Class A, but open file handles may retain ephemeral context to allow certain operations to complete in the background.</li>
<li><strong>Class C (“Protected Until First User Authentication” / “First Unlock”):</strong><br>
Keys are brought into SEP memory after the first successful unlock and persist (subject to policy) until reboot. FileVault’s VEK is conceptually associated with this class on Apple Silicon Macs.</li>
<li><strong>Class D (“No User Secret” / “UID-only”):</strong><br>
Keys wrapped solely by the UID (and SKP where applicable). Used for data that must be accessible before user login (e.g. some system daemons and metadata). On Apple Silicon, user data is generally not assigned to Class D.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Unwrapping ceremony</strong></p>
<p>When a user logs in on a FileVault-enabled Apple Silicon Mac:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><code>loginwindow</code> submits the password through the authentication pipeline; upon acceptance, the kernel passes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The user’s keybag blob.</li>
<li>The supplied password (or a derivative).<br>
to the SEP via AppleSEPKeyStore.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inside SEP:</p>
<ul>
<li>The password is run through the configured KDF.</li>
<li>The UID key and measurement inputs are combined via the tangling function to derive the PDK.</li>
<li>The keybag’s wrapped class keys are unwrapped using the PDK and UID.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The unwrapped class keys remain resident only inside SEP-protected memory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The SEP returns <strong>handles</strong> (numeric identifiers or similar) for the class keys to the kernel rather than the keys themselves.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Subsequent file I/O and volume operations refer to class keys by these handles, never by raw key bits.</p>
<h4 id="1032-sealed-key-protection-skp-binding-data-to-measurement">10.3.2 Sealed Key Protection (SKP): Binding Data to Measurement</h4>
<p>Tahoe introduces and extends <strong>Sealed Key Protection (SKP)</strong> as a defense against “Evil Maid” scenarios where an attacker boots a compromised or downgraded OS to attack the disk encryption keys.</p>
<p><strong>Measurement chain</strong></p>
<p>During boot:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Secure Enclave’s <strong>Boot Monitor</strong> verifies and measures <code>sepOS</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>sepOS</code> in turn measures:</p>
<ul>
<li>The macOS kernelcache.</li>
<li>The LocalPolicy describing boot and security configuration (e.g. SIP, boot policy, secure boot level).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>These measurements are accumulated into internal registers within the SEP (conceptually similar to TPM PCRs, but not exposed as such).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Sealed keys</strong></p>
<p>When the Volume Encryption Key (VEK) and class keys are created (e.g. at install or FileVault enablement time), they are wrapped under a key derived from:</p>
<ul>
<li>The UID key.</li>
<li>The passcode-derived material (PDK).</li>
<li>The current boot-chain measurement.</li>
</ul>
<p>Conceptually:</p>
<pre><code>KEK = KDF( UID, PDK, Measurement )
WrappedVEK = Encrypt( VEK, KEK )
</code></pre>
<p>At unlock time:</p>
<ul>
<li>The same derivation is repeated inside the SEP using the current Measurement.</li>
<li>If the OS, LocalPolicy, or relevant firmware has changed in a way that alters the Measurement beyond allowed ranges, the derived KEK will be different and the unwrap will fail—even if the correct password is supplied.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Security consequence</strong></p>
<p>To successfully decrypt the data volume, an attacker must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Possess the user’s secret (or otherwise satisfy SEP policy).</li>
<li>Boot into an OS configuration that produces an acceptable Measurement (signed, authorized kernel + LocalPolicy consistent with SKP policy).</li>
<li>Run on the original or equivalently provisioned hardware (UID key, SEP state).</li>
</ul>
<p>Downgrades to vulnerable kernels, custom kernels, or off-device keybag attacks are blocked at the SKP layer.</p>
<h4 id="1033-the-hardware-aes-engine-the-wrapped-key-path">10.3.3 The Hardware AES Engine &amp; the Wrapped-Key Path</h4>
<p>A common misconception is that the macOS kernel decrypts file contents. On Apple Silicon, the encryption/decryption of user data is handled by a dedicated <strong>AES engine</strong> on the SoC, integrated with the memory and storage controllers.</p>
<p><strong>Inline encryption path</strong></p>
<p>When a user process performs a file read:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Metadata lookup:</strong><br>
The APFS driver consults file metadata to obtain:</p>
<ul>
<li>The identifier or handle for the per-file key (wrapped).</li>
<li>The relevant class key handle for this file.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Key request to SEP:</strong><br>
The kernel sends:</p>
<ul>
<li>The wrapped per-file key.</li>
<li>The class key handle.<br>
to the SEP via AppleSEPKeyStore.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SEP translation:</strong><br>
The SEP:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Unwraps the per-file key using the class key resident in SEP memory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Programs the SoC’s AES engine with the resulting key via an internal, non-CPU-addressable interface; or</li>
<li>Re-wraps the per-file key under an ephemeral engine-only key and passes that to the AES engine.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>DMA from storage:</strong><br>
The kernel issues a read from the NAND-backed storage through the ANS/AGS storage controller, referencing the relevant blocks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>On-the-fly decryption:</strong><br>
As data flows through the storage path into DRAM:</p>
<ul>
<li>The AES engine decrypts the ciphertext using the key material that was just programmed.</li>
<li>The decrypted plaintext is written into the page cache.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Key lifetime:</strong><br>
The AES engine’s key state is ephemeral and tightly scoped to the I/O operation. The AP never sees the cleartext per-file key; the SEP holds the root class keys and controls when engine keys exist.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>RE Implication</strong></p>
<p>Forensics and offensive implications:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dumping kernel memory will reveal plaintext file contents (resident in the page cache) but not the keys that decrypted them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Per-file and class keys exist only inside the SEP and (transiently) in engine-private state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recovering those keys requires either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compromising the SEP firmware and dumping its internal state (e.g., SRAM, xART).</li>
<li>Attacking the AES engine at the hardware level.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="1034-re-focus-analyzing-the-applesepkeystore-kernel-extension">10.3.4 RE Focus: Analyzing the <code>AppleSEPKeyStore</code> Kernel Extension</h4>
<p>The primary interface between the kernel and the SEP’s key-management logic is the <strong><code>AppleSEPKeyStore</code></strong> kernel extension. For Tahoe and Apple Silicon, this binary is the focal point for understanding the proprietary AP ↔ SEP protocol.</p>
<p><strong>Key responsibilities (RE-derived)</strong></p>
<p>Typical symbols and responsibilities observed across releases include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>aks_unwrap_key</code> / related functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accept wrapped keys (e.g. from keybags, per-file metadata).</li>
<li>Prepare and send unwrap requests to the SEP.</li>
<li>Return handles or status to callers in the kernel.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>aks_get_lock_state</code> / equivalents:</p>
<ul>
<li>Query the SEP for the current lock / unlock state and biometric backoff state.</li>
<li>Update kernel-side views of whether user data should be considered accessible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Message demultiplexers (e.g. <code>sep_key_store_client_handle_message</code>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Parse TLV-encoded responses from the SEP.</li>
<li>Dispatch them to the correct waiters in the kernel or userland.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Attack surface</strong></p>
<p>From a reverse-engineering and exploitation perspective, several patterns emerge:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Handle confusion:</strong><br>
Keys are referred to by relatively small integer handles in the kernel. Bugs that cause handles to be mis-associated across security domains (system vs. user, different users, different contexts) could allow an attacker to induce the SEP to use a more privileged key than intended.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>State desynchronization:</strong><br>
<code>AppleSEPKeyStore</code> maintains shadow state about lock status, key availability, and pending operations. Any discrepancy between this state and the SEP’s internal view could create TOCTOU-style conditions where:</p>
<ul>
<li>The kernel believes an operation is permitted, but the SEP does not (and vice versa).</li>
<li>A key handle is assumed valid when the SEP has already invalidated it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>TLV parsing:</strong><br>
The AP-side parser for SEP messages handles complex TLV structures. Memory-safety bugs or logic errors here represent a classic attack surface, albeit one increasingly hardened by modern CFI, PAC, and mitigation layers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tahoe hardening (observed)</strong></p>
<p>On Tahoe-era builds, interactions between <code>AppleSEPKeyStore</code> and higher-privilege operations (e.g., enabling FileVault, changing recovery keys, altering LocalPolicy-bound state) show evidence of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Additional checks that correlate key operations with TXM / GL1 policy decisions.</li>
<li>Stricter coupling between “is this operation permitted under the current Measurement and LocalPolicy?” and “should this unwrap / key creation be forwarded to the SEP?”</li>
</ul>
<p>Public documentation does not yet spell out this coupling, but runtime traces and binary analysis strongly suggest that Apple is moving more of the authorization logic <em>below</em> the kernel and into the measured, SEP-adjacent policy domain.</p>
<h2 id="110-conclusion-the-attack-surface-landscape">11.0 Conclusion: The Attack Surface Landscape</h2>
<p>The architectural transformation introduced with macOS Tahoe and the M3/M4 silicon generation signifies the end of the "Kernel is King" era. We have moved from a monolithic trust model, where <code>uid=0</code> and <code>tfp0</code> were the ultimate objectives, to a federated security model where the kernel is merely a highly privileged, yet strictly supervised, tenant within a hardware-enforced hypervisor.</p>
<p>For the vulnerability researcher, this necessitates a shift in methodology. Fuzzing syscalls is no longer sufficient to compromise the system's root of trust. The new frontier lies in the <strong>Boundary Crossings</strong>—the specific, hardware-mediated bridges that allow data and execution flow to traverse the isolated domains.</p>
<h3 id="111-summary-of-boundary-crossings">11.1 Summary of Boundary Crossings</h3>
<p>The following matrix details the architectural boundaries, the mechanisms used to traverse them, and the specific attack surface exposed at each junction.</p>
<h4 id="1111-userland-el0-%E2%86%94-kernel-el2vhe">11.1.1 Userland (EL0) ↔ Kernel (EL2/VHE)</h4>
<p><em>The Traditional Boundary, Hardened by Silicon.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Transition Mechanism:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Entry:</strong> <code>SVC</code> (Supervisor Call) instruction triggering a synchronous exception to the kernel exception vector (<code>VBAR_EL1 + 0x400</code>, or the EL2 alias under VHE on macOS).</li>
<li><strong>Exit:</strong> <code>ERET</code> (Exception Return) restoring <code>PC</code> and <code>PSTATE</code> from <code>ELR_EL1</code>/<code>ELR_EL2</code> and <code>SPSR_EL1</code>/<code>SPSR_EL2</code> (depending on the concrete VHE configuration).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hardware Enforcement:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PAC:</strong> Entry points are signed. The kernel verifies the thread state signature (<code>kauth_thread_state</code>) on return, ensuring return-address and register integrity.</li>
<li><strong>PPL/SPTM:</strong> The kernel cannot modify its own text or page tables to disable SMEP/SMAP equivalents (<code>PAN</code>/<code>PXN</code>). Page-table integrity and code immutability are ultimately enforced by the SPTM rather than by EL2 alone.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Tahoe Shift:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The kernel is no longer the final arbiter of virtual memory. When a user process requests <code>mmap(RWX)</code>, the kernel cannot simply write to the translation tables; it must request the <strong>SPTM</strong> to map the page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Attack Surface:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Logic Bugs:</strong> Standard memory corruption (UAF, heap overflow) in kernel extensions still yields privileged kernel execution in the EL2/VHE context.</li>
<li><strong>PAC Bypasses:</strong> Forging pointers to survive the <code>ERET</code> path or function-pointer authentication (return addresses, vtables, dispatch tables).</li>
<li><strong>Argument Sanitization:</strong> The kernel must sanitize user pointers and lengths before passing them to the SPTM. A "Confused Deputy" attack where the kernel is tricked into asking the SPTM to map a privileged page into user space is the new <code>tfp0</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ul>
<h4 id="1112-kernel-el2-%E2%86%94-secure-page-table-monitor-gl2">11.1.2 Kernel (EL2) ↔ Secure Page Table Monitor (GL2)</h4>
<p><em>The "Mechanism" Boundary: The New Hypervisor.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Transition Mechanism:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Entry:</strong> <code>GENTER</code> (Opcode <code>0x00201420</code>) with the <code>sptm_dispatch_target_t</code> in <strong><code>x16</code></strong> (encoding Domain + Dispatch Table ID + Endpoint). The 5-bit immediate in the <code>GENTER</code> instruction selects the GXF entry stub and is recorded in <code>ESR_GLx</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Exit:</strong> <code>GEXIT</code> (Opcode <code>0x00201400</code>), returning from GL2 to the kernel’s EL2/VHE context.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hardware Enforcement:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>GXF:</strong> Hardware context switch of <code>SP_EL2</code>/<code>SP_EL1</code> → <code>SP_GL2</code> and the corresponding GL2 state (<code>SPSR_GL2</code>, <code>ELR_GL2</code>, <code>ESR_GL2</code>).</li>
<li><strong>SPRR:</strong> Atomic switch of permission views. Kernel text becomes RO/NX from the GL2 perspective; SPTM text/data become RX/RW as configured for GL2 and remain inaccessible from EL2.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Exchange:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Registers:</strong> <code>x0</code>–<code>x7</code> carry arguments (physical page numbers, ASIDs, permission bitmasks, context IDs). <code>x16</code> carries the dispatch target (<code>sptm_domain_t</code> + table + endpoint).</li>
<li><strong>Shared Memory:</strong> None in the normal call path. The SPTM reads and writes physical memory directly via its own linear map and page-table view.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Attack Surface:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>State Machine Confusion:</strong> The SPTM enforces a Finite State Machine (FSM) on every physical page (Frame Table). The primary attack vector is finding a sequence of <code>retype</code>/<code>map</code>/<code>unmap</code> calls that desynchronizes the SPTM’s view of a page from the hardware’s actual usage (e.g., aliasing a <code>PAGE_TABLE</code> frame as <code>XNU_DATA</code>).</li>
<li><strong>Input Validation:</strong> Passing invalid physical addresses, truncated ranges, or edge-case permission combinations to <code>sptm_map</code>/<code>sptm_unmap</code>/<code>sptm_map_iommu</code>, especially under high contention or refcounted/shared-frame scenarios.</li>
<li><strong>Panic-as-Oracle:</strong> Because invalid or inconsistent requests cause the SPTM to return fatal errors that XNU treats as unrecoverable and converts into kernel panics, timing side-channels or fault-injection during the <code>GENTER</code> window are potential vectors to infer GL2 layout and state (e.g., distinguishing “valid but denied” vs “structurally impossible” transitions via differing panic paths or latencies).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="1113-kernel-el2-%E2%86%94-trusted-execution-monitor-txm">11.1.3 Kernel (EL2) ↔ Trusted Execution Monitor (TXM)</h4>
<p><em>The “Policy” Boundary: Code-Signing and Entitlement Authority.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Transition Mechanism:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Entry:</strong> XNU invokes TXM through <code>txm_kernel_call()</code> and related wrappers. These routines set up a dedicated TXM stack, marshal a call descriptor (selector, argument vector, return buffer), and then perform the CPU sequence required to enter the TXM context. On current iOS releases, reverse-engineering shows that TXM itself uses <code>SVC</code> to perform in-monitor calls; on Tahoe, the interface exposed to XNU is via these <code>txm_*</code> entry points rather than a raw <code>GENTER</code> stub.</li>
<li><strong>Exit:</strong> TXM writes its result into the call descriptor, updates a status field, and returns to XNU, which interprets the status. Depending on selector and flags, some TXM failures are converted into kernel panics.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hardware Enforcement:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SPTM-Supervised Domain:</strong> TXM resides in a region whose code and data are owned and typed by SPTM. XNU has no direct write access to TXM text or critical data; changes must go through SPTM retyping and mapping operations.</li>
<li><strong>Privilege Ordering:</strong> Apple’s OS integrity documentation describes TXM as a lower-privilege component used by SPTM to enforce code-signing and integrity policy. Even if TXM were compromised, SPTM still mediates page-table updates and frame typing; memory integrity does not collapse automatically.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Exchange:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pointers and Metadata:</strong> XNU passes pointers (or physical addresses) to Code Directories, CMS blobs, trust caches, and entitlement structures, along with lengths and flags. TXM interprets these structures and returns accept/deny decisions plus auxiliary metadata.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Trust Cache Operations:</strong> TXM selectors cover registration and removal of trust-cache entries, enabling or disabling specific code-signing relaxations, and managing development/debug modes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Attack Surface:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Parser Complexity:</strong> TXM must parse Mach-O headers, CodeDirectories, CMS/ASN.1, entitlements, and various policy structures. Bugs in these parsers can yield powerful policy-manipulation primitives (for example, arbitrary trust-cache entries or coerced acceptance of malformed signatures), but SPTM still constrains what memory mappings are possible.</li>
<li><strong>Policy Downgrade and LocalPolicy Handling:</strong> Incorrect handling of boot arguments and LocalPolicy data can cause persistent relaxation of code-signing or integrity checks. Exploits here influence what code TXM authorizes, but do not directly grant the ability to arbitrarily rewrite protected frames without also influencing SPTM.</li>
<li><strong>TOCTOU and Retyping:</strong> If the buffers that TXM inspects are not retyped or otherwise shielded by SPTM, there is a window where DMA or kernel code could mutate them between TXM’s checks and subsequent use. Correct integration of SPTM retyping with TXM’s parsing determines how exploitable such races are.</li>

<h3 id="112-the-intel-gap-security-disparities-between-x86-and-apple-silicon">11.2 The "Intel Gap": Security Disparities between x86 and Apple Silicon</h3>
<p>While macOS Tahoe presents a unified user experience across architectures, the underlying security reality is a tale of two operating systems. On Apple Silicon, macOS is a hypervisor-managed, hardware-attested fortress. On Intel (x86_64), it remains a traditional monolithic kernel relying on legacy protection mechanisms. This divergence has created a massive "Intel Gap"—a disparity in exploit mitigation so severe that the same vulnerability often yields a trivial root shell on Intel while resulting in a harmless panic on Apple Silicon.</p>
<p>For the reverse engineer, understanding this gap is essential for targeting. The Intel architecture represents the "Soft Target," lacking the silicon-enforced boundaries of the SPTM, TXM, and PAC.</p>
<h4 id="1121-lateral-privilege-gl2-vs-ring-0">11.2.1 Lateral Privilege: GL2 vs Ring 0</h4>
<p>The critical difference between Intel and Apple-silicon Tahoe systems is the existence, on Apple silicon, of a privilege layer <em>above</em> the kernel that continues to enforce memory-integrity invariants even after a kernel compromise.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Apple Silicon:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>XNU runs at EL2 under the supervision of SPTM in GL2. SPTM is the sole authority for page-table retyping and for managing frame types that correspond to kernel text, page tables, IOMMU tables, and other critical regions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TXM executes in a lower-privilege domain than SPTM and provides code-signing and integrity policy decisions. SPTM calls into TXM to decide whether particular mappings or code images are acceptable, but SPTM remains the arbiter of what is actually mapped and how frames are typed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A kernel exploit that yields KRW in XNU provides strong influence over control flow and data within EL2 and allows attempts to mis-use SPTM/TXM as confused deputies. However, the attacker must still either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drive SPTM through an illegal but accepted state transition (retyping or mapping), or</li>
<li>Gain sufficient influence over TXM and then exploit the TXM–SPTM interface,<br>
to obtain equivalent authority over page tables and sealed code.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Intel x86_64:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The kernel runs in Ring 0 and directly controls page tables, VT-d configuration, and most integrity mechanisms below the T2’s secure boot checks.</li>
<li>There is no SPTM-equivalent hypervisor above Ring 0 enforcing frame typing or page-table integrity at runtime. Once KRW is obtained and static KTRR is bypassed or worked around, the attacker can patch kernel text, alter page tables, and reconfigure DMA mappings with no higher-privilege arbiter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Under this model, KRW on Apple silicon is an intermediate privilege level situated below SPTM/TXM, whereas KRW on Intel is much closer to the maximum privilege available to macOS.</p>
<h4 id="1122-static-vs-dynamic-kernel-integrity-ktrr-vs-sptm">11.2.2 Static vs. Dynamic Kernel Integrity (KTRR vs. SPTM)</h4>
<p>Both architectures attempt to enforce <strong>Kernel Text Read-Only Region (KTRR)</strong>, but the implementation differs fundamentally in flexibility and robustness.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intel (Hardware KTRR):</strong> On recent Intel Macs, KTRR is implemented via proprietary memory controller registers (configured via <code>MSR</code>).
<ul>
<li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> The firmware locks a physical range of memory as Read-Only/Executable.</li>
<li><strong>Limitation:</strong> This is <strong>Static</strong>. Once the range is locked at boot, it cannot change. This forces the kernel to fit all immutable code into a contiguous block. It cannot protect dynamically loaded drivers (KEXTs) with the same hardware rigor. KEXTs rely on software-managed page tables (<code>CR0.WP</code> bit), which a compromised kernel can disable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Apple Silicon (SPTM):</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> The SPTM manages the Frame Table.</li>
<li><strong>Advantage:</strong> This is <strong>Dynamic</strong>. The kernel can load a new extension (AKC), link it, and then ask the SPTM to "Seal" it. The SPTM transitions those specific pages to <code>XNU_TEXT</code>. This allows the "Immutable Kernel" coverage to extend to late-loaded drivers, a feat impossible on the static Intel KTRR implementation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="1123-the-cfi-chasm-pac-vs-cet">11.2.3 The CFI Chasm: PAC vs. CET</h4>
<p>Control Flow Integrity (CFI) is the primary defense against ROP/JOP.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apple Silicon:</strong> <strong>Pointer Authentication (PAC)</strong> is ubiquitous. It protects return addresses (stack), function pointers (heap/data), and C++ vtables. It provides cryptographic diversity based on pointer context.</li>
<li><strong>Intel x86:</strong> Intel Macs support <strong>Control-flow Enforcement Technology (CET)</strong>, specifically Shadow Stacks (<code>IBT</code> support is limited).
<ul>
<li><strong>The Gap:</strong> CET Shadow Stacks protect return addresses effectively, but they do not protect <strong>Forward-Edge</strong> transfers (function pointers) with the same granularity as PAC.</li>
<li><strong>Data Pointers:</strong> Crucially, Intel has no equivalent to <code>APDAKey</code> (Data Key). An attacker on Intel can still perform <strong>Data-Oriented Programming (DOP)</strong>—swapping valid object pointers or corrupting decision-making flags—without triggering a hardware fault. On Apple Silicon, these pointers are signed; forging them requires a signing gadget.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="1124-the-root-of-trust-t2-vs-on-die-boot-rom">11.2.4 The Root of Trust: T2 vs. On-Die Boot ROM</h4>
<p>The boot chain trust anchor differs physically.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intel:</strong> The Root of Trust is the <strong>Apple T2 Security Chip</strong> (on models 2018-2020).
<ul>
<li><strong>The Weakness:</strong> The T2 is a discrete bridge. It verifies the <code>boot.efi</code> and kernelcache signature <em>before</em> the Intel CPU starts. However, once the Intel CPU is executing, the T2 is effectively a peripheral connected via USB/PCIe. It cannot introspect the Intel CPU's execution state. It cannot stop a runtime kernel exploit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Apple Silicon:</strong> The Root of Trust is the <strong>AP Boot ROM</strong>.
<ul>
<li><strong>The Strength:</strong> The security logic (SEP, PKA, Boot Monitor) is on the <em>same die</em>. The Secure Enclave can monitor the power and clock lines of the AP. The SPTM (running on the AP) enforces the boot measurements continuously. The trust chain is not "handed off"; it is maintained throughout the runtime lifecycle.</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Intel:</strong> Uses <strong>VT-d</strong> (Intel Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O).

<li><strong>Configuration:</strong> The kernel configures the IOMMU tables.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Apple Silicon:</strong> Uses <strong>DART</strong> (Device Address Resolution Table).
<ul>
<li><strong>Enforcement:</strong> As detailed in Section 7.2.2, the kernel <em>cannot</em> write to DART registers. Only the SPTM can map I/O memory.</li>
<li><strong>Result:</strong> Even a compromised kernel cannot weaponize a peripheral to perform a DMA attack against the monitor or the kernel text, because the SPTM will reject the mapping request.</li>

<p><strong>Conclusion for the Researcher:</strong><br>
The "Intel Gap" means that legacy Intel Macs are essentially running a different, far more vulnerable operating system, despite sharing the macOS version number. Exploits that require complex, multi-stage chains on M3 (e.g., bypassing PAC, confusing SPTM, racing TXM) can often be reduced to a single Use-After-Free and a ROP chain on Intel. As Apple phases out Intel support, the "easy mode" of macOS exploitation is rapidly vanishing.</p>
<h3 id="113-future-trends-the-expansion-of-exclaves-and-the-death-of-kernel-extensions">11.3 Future Trends: The expansion of Exclaves and the death of Kernel Extensions</h3>
<p>The trajectory of macOS security architecture is not asymptotic; it is directional. Apple is not merely patching vulnerabilities in XNU; they are actively architecting its obsolescence as a security boundary. The "Tahoe" architecture provides the silicon primitives (SPTM, TXM, GL2) required to execute a long-term strategy of <strong>Architectural Attrition</strong>.</p>
<p>The future of macOS exploitation lies in understanding two concurrent trends: the ossification of the XNU kernel into a static, immutable appliance, and the migration of high-value logic into the opaque, hardware-isolated world of Exclaves.</p>
<h4 id="1131-the-deprecation-of-kmodload-the-static-kernel">11.3.1 The Deprecation of <code>kmod_load</code>: The Static Kernel</h4>
<p>For decades, the ability to load Kernel Extensions (KEXTs) was a defining feature of macOS. It was also its Achilles' heel. KEXTs run at EL1, share the kernel's address space, and historically lacked the rigorous code review applied to the core kernel.</p>
<p>The mechanism for this—the <strong><code>kmod_load</code></strong> syscall (and the associated <code>kmod_control</code> traps)—represents a massive attack surface. It requires the kernel to possess a runtime linker (<code>kld</code>), capable of resolving symbols, applying relocations, and modifying executable memory.</p>
<p><strong>The DriverKit End-Game:</strong><br>
Apple has systematically introduced userland replacements for kernel drivers: <code>USBDriverKit</code>, <code>HIDDriverKit</code>, <code>AudioDriverKit</code>, and <code>NetworkingDriverKit</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Current State:</strong> In Tahoe, third-party KEXTs are deprecated. The userland tool <code>kmutil</code> manages the policy, but the actual loading still relies on the kernel's ability to link code. Loading a legacy KEXT now requires reducing system security (disabling SIP/Secure Boot) and interacting with the <strong>TXM</strong> via <strong>LocalPolicy</strong> to explicitly authorize the hash.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Future State: The Death of the Runtime Linker:</strong><br>
We are approaching a point where the kernel will effectively lose the ability to load dynamic code entirely in "Full Security" mode. The goal is to remove the <code>kmod_load</code> logic from the kernel entirely.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The "Sealed" Kernel:</strong> The <strong>Boot Kernel Collection (BKC)</strong> (loaded by iBoot) and the <strong>Auxiliary Kernel Collection (AKC)</strong> (loaded early by <code>kernelmanagerd</code>) will be the <em>only</em> permitted executable kernel code.</li>
<li><strong>Pre-Linked Immutability:</strong> By moving all linking to build-time (kernelcache generation) or boot-time (iBoot verification), Apple can strip the dynamic linker logic (<code>kld</code>) from the runtime kernel. If the kernel doesn't know how to link a Mach-O, it cannot load a rootkit.</li>
<li><strong>SPTM Enforcement:</strong> The <strong>SPTM</strong> already enforces that <code>XNU_TEXT</code> is immutable. The logical next step is for the SPTM to reject <em>any</em> <code>sptm_retype</code> request that attempts to create new <code>XNU_TEXT</code> pages after the initial boot sealing phase is complete.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>RE Implication:</strong><br>
The era of the "Rootkit" is ending. If you cannot introduce new code into EL1 via <code>kmod_load</code>, and you cannot modify existing code due to KTRR/SPTM, persistence in the kernel becomes impossible. Attackers will be forced to live entirely within data-only attacks (DOP) or move their persistence to userland (which is easier to detect) or firmware (which is harder to achieve).</p>
<h4 id="1132-exclave-expansion-eating-the-monolith">11.3.2 Exclave Expansion: Eating the Monolith</h4>
<p>If XNU is the "Insecure World," Exclaves are the "Secure World." Currently, Exclaves are used for high-sensitivity, low-complexity tasks (Privacy Indicators, Passkeys). However, the architecture is designed to scale. Apple is effectively strangling the monolithic kernel by slowly migrating critical subsystems out of EL1 and into Exclaves.</p>
<p><strong>Candidates for Migration:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Network Stack (<code>skywalk</code>):</strong><br>
Apple has already introduced <code>skywalk</code>, a userland networking subsystem. The logical evolution is to move the TCP/IP stack and packet filtering logic into an Exclave.
<ul>
<li><em>Benefit:</em> A remote code execution vulnerability in the Wi-Fi firmware or the TCP stack would compromise an isolated Exclave, not the entire kernel. The SPTM would prevent the compromised network stack from touching system memory.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Filesystem Encryption (APFS):</strong><br>
Currently, <code>AppleSEPKeyStore</code> handles key wrapping, but the bulk encryption happens via the AES Engine managed by the kernel. Moving the filesystem driver's cryptographic logic to an Exclave would ensure that even a kernel compromise cannot exfiltrate file keys, as the keys would exist only within the Exclave's memory domain.</li>
<li><strong>Audio and Media Processing:</strong><br>
To protect DRM content and prevent microphone eavesdropping, the entire CoreAudio engine could be moved to a "Media Conclave."</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The "Dark Matter" OS:</strong><br>
As more logic moves to Exclaves, a significant portion of the OS execution flow becomes invisible to standard introspection tools.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No DTrace:</strong> You cannot DTrace an Exclave.</li>
<li><strong>No kdebug:</strong> Kernel tracing will show a "black hole" where the request enters <code>XNUProxy</code> and vanishes until the result returns.</li>
<li><strong>Opaque State:</strong> The memory of an Exclave is physically unmappable by the kernel. A kernel memory dump (coredump) will contain gaps where the Exclave memory resides.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="1133-the-hollow-kernel-hypothesis">11.3.3 The "Hollow Kernel" Hypothesis</h4>
<p>Extrapolating these trends leads to the <strong>Hollow Kernel Hypothesis</strong>.</p>
<p>In this future architecture, XNU (EL1) is demoted to a <strong>Compatibility Shim</strong>. Its primary role is to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Provide POSIX system call semantics for legacy userland applications.</li>
<li>Manage coarse-grained scheduling of CPU resources.</li>
<li>Act as a message bus (via <code>XNUProxy</code>) between userland applications and the real system logic running in Exclaves.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The Security Inversion:</strong><br>
In the traditional model, the Kernel protects the User. In the Hollow Kernel model, the <strong>Hardware (SPTM/TXM) protects the System from the Kernel.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The kernel is treated as untrusted code.</li>
<li>The TCB (Trusted Computing Base) shrinks from "The entire Kernel" to "The SPTM, TXM, and specific Exclaves."</li>
<li>A kernel compromise becomes a "Local DoS" or "Privacy Violation" rather than a "System Compromise."</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="1134-the-visibility-gap-the-end-of-passive-analysis">11.3.4 The Visibility Gap: The End of Passive Analysis</h4>
<p>For the reverse engineer, this shift is catastrophic for visibility.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tightbeam IDL:</strong> The interface between XNU and Exclaves is defined by Tightbeam. Unlike MIG, which was relatively static, Tightbeam protocols can evolve rapidly. Reverse engineering the system will require constantly reconstructing these serialization formats.</li>
<li><strong>The "Intel Gap" Closure:</strong> As Apple phases out Intel support completely, they will likely remove the legacy code paths in XNU that supported the "un-isolated" model. This will make the kernel source code (if still released) increasingly divergent from the binary reality running on M-series chips.</li>
<li><strong>Hardware-Locked Debugging:</strong> Debugging an Exclave likely requires "Red" (Development) fused silicon. Researchers working on retail "Green" (Production) hardware will be effectively locked out of analyzing the internal logic of these secure subsystems, forced to treat them as black boxes and fuzz their inputs via <code>XNUProxy</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Final Thought:</strong><br>
macOS is no longer just a Unix system. It is a distributed system running on a single die, governed by a hypervisor that doesn't exist in software. The kernel is dead; long live the Monitor.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
      <p>I owe Mozilla a thank-you. Really, I do. Maybe an Edible Arrangement? People like those. Some lil pineapples cut into stars on sticks and chocolate strawberries might brighten their day. For the note, I'm thinking something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for proving me exactly right.</p>
<p>XOXO
MT</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eight months ago, in the fallout of Mozilla's fumbling of a Privacy Policy update, I <a href="https://taggart-tech.com/mozilla-cycle-pt2/">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Mozilla is pursuing its primary objective, which is the survival of Mozilla. Its mission statement is more than broad enough to accommodate that, and Firefox is not a real priority. The community should accept that and stop waiting for Mozilla to be the hero they deserve.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Regrettably, I was unable to take my own advice on the last part. So here we are yet again, marveling at Mozilla's dedication toward eroding decades of good will in the community they purportedly serve. To quote one of my <a href="https://achewood.com/2006/06/21/title.html">sacred texts</a>, it's a focus and intensity normally seen only in successes.</p>
<p>Back in the present, we have Mozilla <del>doubling</del> <del>tripling</del> <em>n</em>thing down on this direction. First, with their <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/firefox/ai-window/">announcement</a> of "AI Window," a new feature (used very loosely) coming to Firefox which seems to emulate the user experience offered by AI browsers like Perplexity's Comet or OpenAI's Atlas. In other words, instead of performing search from the address bar and interacting with websites like browsers have done since they were invented, your first interaction will be with a language model prompt, which then mediates your experience of the web.</p>
<p>Not to gloat, but <a href="https://taggart-tech.com/interfaces/">I told you so</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://connect.mozilla.org/t5/discussions/building-ai-the-firefox-way-shaping-what-s-next-together/td-p/109922/">response</a> from the Firefox community has not just been overwhelmingly negative, it is <em>universally</em> negative as far as I can tell. At least among users willing to post on Mozilla's forums about the issue, which is absolutely a biased sample set. I have received some comments separately in support of Firefox, but they are countable and the vast, vast minority. Mozilla's core audience hates this move. At the very least, they would want all the AI components of Firefox to be opt-in, a choice that Firefox has been unwilling to make so far, instead enabling these new features by default.</p>
<p>What does Mozilla do? Temper the plan? Ease up on the forced features?</p>
<p>Nah, they do what any good corporate PR person would tell you to do when facing public backlash: <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/rewiring-mozilla-ai-and-web/">post through it</a>.</p>
<p>This post is a summary of Mozilla's new Strategic Plan, which is viewable in full <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2025/11/Mozilla-Summary-Portfolio-Strategy.pdf">here</a>. I read it through a few times, and my brain nearly ripped in half from the cognitive dissonance involved. But I think it's worth examining Mozilla's claims carefully. They are:</p>
<ol>
<li>AI (by which they mean generative AI) is a transformative technology that will fundamentally alter how we interact with machines and the web.</li>
<li>The current landscape is dangerous and controlled by big tech and "closed source" models.</li>
<li>Mozilla should therefore pivot to develop and support "open source" AI implementations the same way they advocated for open web standards.</li>
</ol>
<p>The strategy details the "what" and "how" of Mozilla's transformation in this direction. We're going to touch on some of those points, but let's begin with these big claims, affording Mozilla maximum benefit of the doubt.</p>
<p>Is generative AI a transformative technology? The Corpos sure seem to want it to be, although its actual usage seems mostly to be chatbot-related. All other attempts to use this trick in other realms have failed rather miserably. Microsoft, for example, <a href="https://taggart-tech.com/mozilla-cycle-pt3/theverge.com/report/822443/microsoft-windows-copilot-vision-ai-assistant-pc-voice-controls-impressions">wants you to talk to your computer</a> instead of using a mouse and keyboard <em>like a dinosaur</em>. The results, unfortunately, are much worse than the Jurassic version of computer interaction. The pattern holds true across the board. Google's AI Overview continues to be an inferior provider of information than solid web search results. Also, as it turns out, people <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgaf316">learn less</a> from LLM output.</p>
<p>Even the AI browsers Mozilla wants to emulate have significant issues, vulnerable to <a href="https://layerxsecurity.com/blog/layerx-identifies-vulnerability-in-new-chatgpt-atlas-browser/">old web vulnerabilities</a> and <a href="https://guard.io/labs/scamlexity-we-put-agentic-ai-browsers-to-the-test-they-clicked-they-paid-they-failed">new attacks</a> against the models themselves.</p>
<p>Generative AI is transforming something, but I don't think it's the web, and I don't think it's for the better.</p>
<p>Which means their second claim is definitely true! The current landscape <em>is</em> dangerous, as I've been decrying for years.</p>
<p>But because Mozilla is convinced that generative AI is a force for good (with no evidence to back that claim up), they conclude that their mission must be to create "open source" alternatives to commercial ("big tech") offerings.</p>
<p>If you truly believe generative AI is a net good but with potential for significant harm, there are arguments to be made for ethical implementations. This same instinct is what propelled researchers from OpenAI to split and found <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/company">Anthropic</a>.</p>
<p>This, however, is an article of <a href="https://taggart-tech.com/faith">faith</a>. It cannot be argued rationally because no empirical evidence exists to support it. The entirety of the belief is predicated on future potential—and it always will be, right up until the harms are so inescapably clear that even the most ardent of believers suffer because of them. Even then, not all of the Flock will lose faith. And as we now see, Mozilla leadership are not just the Flock, but Disciples.</p>
<p>Mozilla has had a conversion experience, while its core audience has not. This results in a schism of purpose.</p>

<h2 id="the-actual-strategy">The Actual Strategy</h2>
<p>Digging into the plan itself, Mozilla's ambitions are remarkable. Mozilla has, as the plan notes, always measured itself against a "double bottom line" of mission and market success. However, it seems these two criteria are now separately defined by: "a. AI that advances the Manifesto; and b. diversifying revenue away from search."</p>
<p>Their specific goals include:</p>
<ul>
<li>All Mozilla orgs have a flagship AI product by 2028</li>
<li>10% year-over-year community growth</li>
<li>20% year-over-year growth in non-search revenue</li>
<li>3 Mozilla orgs have more than $25M in revenue (currently: 1)</li>
<li>10% year-over-year investment portfolio returns</li>
</ul>
<p>I am dumbfounded by these goals. I can't even be snarky about them. They seem so disconnected from reality that I can't imagine how a Board arrived at them.</p>
<p>Let's go through them one at a time.</p>
<h3 id="flagship-ai-products">"Flagship" AI Products</h3>
<p>What "orgs" are we talking about here? Historically there have been <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/organizations/">two Mozilla organizations</a>: the Mozilla Foundation, which is the not-for-profit to which you donate to preserve the open web); and the Mozilla Corporation, which develops Firefox, makes deals with search engines, and creates other revenue-generating projects like, uh, <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/future-of-pocket">Pocket</a>.</p>
<p>There now exist three other for-profit subsidiaries of the Foundation, although these are not mentioned in the official listings. The first is MZLA Technologies Corporation, which is responsible for <a href="https://blog.thunderbird.net/2020/01/thunderbirds-new-home/">Thunderbird</a>. I can't tell what else they do, if anything.</p>
<p>Another is <a href="https://mozilla.ai/">Mozilla.ai</a>, which has a much clearer purpose. This company produces AI products and services. So of these organizations, 3 of them need to have flagship AI products by 2028. What could that <em>possibly</em> look like?</p>
<p>There is also <a href="https://mozilla.vc/">Mozilla Ventures</a>, which is literally just a venture capital firm throwing money at AI projects that align with Mozilla's Manifesto.</p>
<p><img src="https://taggart-tech.com/mzla_revenue-streams.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Mozilla.ai has the easiest and clearest road, as their <a href="https://www.mozilla.ai/product/agent-platform">Agent Platform</a>is already in early access and is absolutely a commercial product. MZLA has...Thunderbird? So AI-powered Thunderbird? That's what I can figure, although Thunderbird is not exactly known as an AI platform. Their new paid Thunderbird Pro service <a href="https://blog.thunderbird.net/2025/11/thunderbird-pro-november-2025-update/">currently makes no mention</a> of AI integration. That's a headscratcher. Mozilla VenturesAnd finally, we have the Corporation and Firefox.</p>
<p>Let's be as clear as we can possibly be. <strong>Mozilla is an AI company</strong>, and <strong>Firefox will be a flagship AI product</strong> according to this strategic plan. This is the focus for Mozilla, which means users of Firefox will only get more and more AI shoved down their throat, and likely fewer ways to avoid it.</p>

<p>I don't have access to Mozilla's "community" numbers, however they choose to define them. But if the reaction to recent changes is any indication, expecting growth of any kind isn't just optimistic, it's delusional. They are betraying the principles of their core use base in favor of their new god. That behavior is usually not rewarded by users or customers.</p>
<h3 id="financials">Financials</h3>
<p>While I don't have access to community numbers, the Mozilla Foundation must disclose its financials, so <a href="https://assets.mozilla.net/annualreport/2024/mozilla-fdn-2023-fs-final-short-1209.pdf">that I can review</a>—and you can too, if you're broken like me. I don't want to think about how much time I've spent reading Mozilla's 990s.</p>
<p>Looking at their revenue change from 2022 to 2023, we see a <em>drop</em> of 3% in royalties (search deals) and almost 15% in subscriptions and advertising. Let's also note that by these counts, royalties account for about 76% of Mozilla's annual revenue. That's by my own calculation on these disclosure, but Mozilla themselves cite 85% as share of revenue from search alone.</p>
<p><a href="https://assets.mozilla.net/annualreport/2022/mozilla-fdn-2022-fs-final-0908.pdf">2022's numbers</a> show a similar drop (down 3% from 2021) in royalties, but a 25% (!!) jump in subscriptions and ad revenue. My guess is ads, since I don't think the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/products/vpn/">VPN service</a> is raking it in, nor do I think a bunch of people suddenly signed up for Pocket before it died. This would certainly explain why last year, Mozilla <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/advertising/principles/improving-online-advertising/">went hard</a> on their "privacy-honoring" advertising acquisition.</p>
<p>Zooming back out: the current business model is not delivering growth. So the pivot to AI is a bet that investment is out there for alternative sources of AI technology. It's also, tacitly, a bet that the AI bubble will last long enough to get competing products off the ground and attract investment before it's too late.</p>
<p>I...wouldn't be so sure.</p>
<p>As far as their investment portfolio's performance, Mozilla <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/foundation/annualreport/2024/article/financing-an-open-internet-mozillas-path-forward/">has changed their strategy</a> significantly in the last 3 years, resulting in significant increases in dividend and realized gains in investments. What's the change in strategy?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the end of 2022, Mozilla changed our strategy for managing our financial reserves. In prior years we took a purely defensive approach, investing solely in highly liquid fixed-income securities. Our revised approach is focused on delivering a total return to Mozilla after inflation, while maintaining sufficient liquid reserves to weather economic pressures and seize growth opportunities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Translation: we invested more in stocks and less in bonds, T-notes, and CDs. What specifically they've invested in is unclear, but you can probably guess it rhymes with Blavidia. I'm sure they have a diversified portfolio, but <em>if</em> you believe (as I do) that the market is heading for a massive correction, this goal is unattainable and a dangerous target for a strategic plan.</p>
<p>Lastly, on revenue. Mozilla plainly <em>has</em> to diversify away from search, because search is dying. Google itself is trying to kill it, in favor of AI. If this succeeds, Firefox's primary revenue stream is drying up, and they know it. More than anything else, this is the reason for the pivot. As I've said before, the will to survive takes precedence over principle when choosing a path forward for any organization, even a not-for-profit with a stated mission.</p>
<p>These goals are not so much reasonable expectations as existential mandates. Either Mozilla approaches these targets in 3 years, or they may be staring death in the face.</p>
<h2 id="flawed-hypotheses">Flawed Hypotheses</h2>
<p>This strategy hinges on three stated hypotheses from Mozilla:</p>
<ol>
<li>A generational shift in human computer interaction is widening the gap between Mozilla’s products and trustworthy, user-centered experiences.</li>
<li>A vibrant, successful and decentralized open source AI ecosystem is essential if we want independent tech players to thrive — and for innovation to come from everywhere.</li>
<li>The growing need for sovereign, public interest AI which will only be met by governments and public interest tech players pooling resources and banding together.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's...okay. We'll take it from the top.</p>
<p>Would you say generative AI is a "generational shift in human computer interaction?" The Corpos want it to be, but so far this hasn't taken place. Declaring it thus is the wish becoming the father of the thought. Maybe someday a functional language model will govern our interaction with computing machines, but that is nowhere near the case now, and the fundamental flaws in the technology preclude it from being so in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Would you say generative AI is "trustworthy" or "user-centered?" The people who implicitly trust generative AI are suffering from psychosis. It's a pathology. The model creators themselves tell you not to trust them! What are we doing here?</p>
<p>Y'know what is trustworthy? A goddamned URL bar that takes me to the website I want to go to. A search engine that shows me sources, ideally curated for quality.</p>
<p>Okay so hypothesis 1 doesn't pass the sniff test. On to number 2.</p>
<p>Can someone please explain to me what the hell "open source AI" is? Mozilla's helpful <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Strategy#Open_source_AI">Strategy Wiki</a> lists Mozilla's own products and investments under this category. Remember that for LLMs, you have two major "source" components: the dataset on which a model was trained, and the resulting vectors/weights file that comprises the model. Among them is <a href="https://huggingface.co/">HuggingFace</a>, which is probably best understood as GitHub for AI. HuggingFace hosts both models and datasets used in ML/AI applications. It's about as close to open source AI as I can imagine.</p>
<p>Some of those HuggingFace datasets are really useful. Like, for example, the <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/tensonaut/EPSTEIN_FILES_20K">OCRed version of the Epstein Files</a>. That's rad as hell, and I'm glad there's a place to share those things. It's even a goldmine for researchers like me, since datasets containing <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/JailbreakBench/JBB-Behaviors">model jailbreaking prompts</a> are available.</p>
<p>But let's be clear about Mozilla's value proposition of the "transformative" generative AI. These are not small models we're talking about; these are large language models that were trained on massive corpora of text. Those corpora are the "source." We know that the training data for frontier models comes from copyrighted material and material scraped without consent. We also know that code generated from scraped sources may well violate the licenses of that source code in reproduction.</p>
<p>In other words, <strong>there can never be an open source large language model</strong> when the sources are themselves violate of content usage agreements. For all the talk about "ethical" AI, Mozilla fails to address this original sin of the technology.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, I should say "nearly fails." In the "Threats" section of their <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/swot.asp">SWOT analysis</a> of their own strategy, they identify "Open models disappear" as a threat:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Big tech / China stop releasing open models. No public open source frontier models emerge. Mozilla’s strategy is obsolete / outflanked.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay so by "open source AI" you actually mean Qwen/Deepseek/Llama. Cool. Cool cool cool. These are open weight <em>only</em>, so the premise of open data goes out the window. And this threat gives away the fact that Mozilla can only succeed on the backs of frontier models. There is no real plan to "democratize" LLMs, nor can there be for the scale required.</p>
<p>This entire exercise is a farce. Yet again, Mozilla pursues a parasitical relationship with the corpos. It worked last time, right??</p>
<p>Hypothesis 3: the growing need for "sovereign" AI. We've already established that there is no large language model possible without corpo scale and investment, except perhaps with government support. So is that what Mozilla wants? State-sponsored LLMs? This hypothesis points in that direction, with Mozilla as the "public interest tech player" catching a percentage somewhere in the middle. Being a government intermediary is also probably not a safe position for anyone at this juncture, much less a tech company.</p>
<p>But also, what "need" are we talking about here? Why is there a need for any of this at all?</p>
<p>Again we encounter the fundamental schism of purpose between Mozilla trying to survive, and the mission its core audience believes in. You could imagine a Mozilla that decided, "Actually, the web was better without this dreck in it, and the experience of the web is not improved by moving users closer to it." You could imagine an organization that doubled down on true privacy, and a human-centered web. We'll never know what kind of funding streams such an organization could build, because Mozilla has chosen the machines over people. They have chosen quick revenue over long-term sustainability.</p>
<p>It's finally time you and I take the advice I offered before: let Mozilla die. It no longer serves its stated purpose.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://newsletter.bphogan.com/archive/issue-45-markdown-is-holding-you-back/">https://newsletter.bphogan.com/archive/issue-45-markdown-is-holding-you-back/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46017782">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                
                
                    
                        <p>I've used many content formats over the years, and while I love Markdown, I run into its limitations daily when I work on larger documentation projects. </p>
<p>In this issue, you'll look at Markdown and explore why it might not be the best fit for technical content, and what else might work instead. </p>
<h2>Markdown Lacks the Structure You Need</h2>
<p>Markdown is everywhere. It's human-readable, approachable, and has just enough syntax to make docs look good in GitHub or a static site. That ease of use is why it's become the default choice for developer documentation. I'm using Markdown right now to write this newsletter issue. I love it.</p>
<p>But Markdown's biggest advantage is its biggest drawback: it doesn't describe the content like other formats can.</p>
<p>Think about how your content gets consumed. Your content isn't just for human readers. Machines use it too. Your content gets indexed by search engines, and parsed by LLMs, and those things parse the well-formed HTML your systems publish. Markdown's basic syntax only emits a small subset of the available semantic tags HTML allows.</p>
<p>IDE integrations can use your docs, too. And AI agents rely on structure to answer developer questions. If you're only feeding them plain-text Markdown documents to reduce the number of tokens you send, you're not providing as much context as you could.</p>
<p>Worse, when you want to reuse your content or syndicate content into another system, you quickly find out that Markdown is more of the lowest common denominator than a source of truth, as not all Markdown flavors are the same.</p>
<p>There are other options you can use that give you more control. But first, let's look deeper into why you should move away from Markdown for serious work.</p>
<h2>Markdown is "implicit typing" for content</h2>
<p>If you're a developer, you know all about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_and_weak_typing?utm_source=bphogan&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=issue-45-markdown-is-holding-you-back" target="_blank">type systems</a> in programming languages. Some languages use Implicit typing, in which the compiler or interpreter infers the data type from the value. These languages give you flexibility, but no guarantees. That's why many developers prefer languages that use explicit typing, where you predefine data types when writing the code. In those languages, the compiler doesn't just build your code; it guarantees specific rules are followed. That's the main reason for the rise of TypeScript over JavaScript: compile-time guarantees.</p>
<p><strong>Markdown is implicit typing</strong>. It lets you write quickly, but without constraints or guarantees. There's no schema. No way to enforce consistency. A heading in one file might be a <strong>concept</strong>, in another it might be a <strong>step</strong>, and there's no machine-readable distinction between the two.</p>
<p>To complicate things further, there are multiple flavors of Markdown, each with its own features and markup. Here are just a few:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://commonmark.org/?utm_source=bphogan&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=issue-45-markdown-is-holding-you-back" target="_blank">CommonMark</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/?utm_source=bphogan&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=issue-45-markdown-is-holding-you-back" target="_blank">GitHub-Flavored Markdown</a></li>
<li><a href="https://mystmd.org/?utm_source=bphogan&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=issue-45-markdown-is-holding-you-back" target="_blank">MyST</a></li>
<li><a href="https://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/?utm_source=bphogan&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=issue-45-markdown-is-holding-you-back" target="_blank">MultiMarkdown</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You think you're writing "Markdown," but what works in one tool may not render in another. Some Markdown processors allow footnotes, Others ignore soft line breaks. And some even require different formatting for code blocks. Inconsistency makes Markdown a shaky foundation for anything beyond the most basic document.</p>
<p>And then there's <a href="https://mdxjs.com/?utm_source=bphogan&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=issue-45-markdown-is-holding-you-back" target="_blank">MDX</a>, which people often use to extend Markdown to support things it doesn't:</p>
<p>Here's a typical MDX snippet:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code># Install

&lt;Command&gt;npm install my-library&lt;/Command&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<p>That <code>&lt;Command&gt;</code> tag isn't Markdown at all; it's a React component. Instead of using a code block, the author chose to create a special component to standardize how all commands would display in the documentation. </p>
<p>It works beautifully on their site because their publishing system knows what <code>&lt;Command&gt;</code> means. But if they try to syndicate this content to another system, it breaks because that system also needs to implement that component. And even if it was supported elsewhere, there's no guarantee that the component is implemented the same way. </p>
<p>MDX shows that even in Markdown-centric ecosystems, people instinctively add more expressive markup. They know plain Markdown isn't enough. They're reinventing semantic markup, but in a way that's custom, brittle, and not portable.</p>
<h2>Why semantic markup matters</h2>
<p>Semantic markup describes <strong>what content is</strong>, not just <strong>how it should look</strong>. It's the difference between saying "here's a bullet with some text" and "here's a step in a procedure." To a human, those may look the same on a page. To a machine or to a publishing pipeline, they are entirely different. </p>
<p>Web developers already went through all this with HTML. Prior to HTML5, you had <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> as a logical container. But HTML5 introduced <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>,  <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code>, and many other elements that described the content. </p>
<p>Semantic markup matters for two important and related reasons: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transformation and reuse</strong>. With semantic markup, you can publish the same content to HTML, PDF, ePub, or even plain Markdown. With Markdown as your source, you can't easily go to another format. You can't turn a bullet into a <code>&lt;step&gt;</code> or a paragraph into a <code>&lt;para&gt;</code> without guessing. You can't add context if it wasn't there to begin with, but you can strip out what you don't need when you transform the document, and you can choose how to present each thing in a consistent way. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Machine consumption</strong>. LLMs and agents can make better use of content that carries structure. A step marked as a <code>&lt;step&gt;</code> is unambiguous. A bullet point might be a step, or a note, or just a list item. The machine has to guess. This is why XML was a preferred mechanism for web services for a long time, and why <a href="https://json-schema.org/?utm_source=bphogan&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=issue-45-markdown-is-holding-you-back" target="_blank">JSON Schema</a> exists.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's explore four formats that give you more control over structure than plain Markdown.</p>
<h2>reStructuredText</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html?utm_source=bphogan&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=issue-45-markdown-is-holding-you-back" target="_blank">reStructuredText</a> is a plain-text markup language from the Python/Docutils ecosystem that supports directives, roles, and structural semantics. It is the foundational format used by Sphinx for generating documentation.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>Installation</span>
<span>============</span>

<span>..</span> <span>code-block</span><span>::</span> <span>bash</span>

   npm<span> </span>install<span> </span>my-library

<span>..</span> <span>note</span><span>::</span>  
   This library requires Node.JS ≥ 22.

See also <span>:ref:</span><span>`usage-guide`</span>.
</code></pre></div>
<p>Here you see a <code>code-block</code> directive, an admonition (<code>note</code>), and an explicit cross-reference via <code>:ref:</code>. You'll find support for images, figures, topics, sidebars, pull quotes, epigraphs, and citations as well.</p>
<p>All of those encode semantics, not just presentation. </p>
<h2>AsciiDoc</h2>
<p><a href="https://asciidoc.org/?utm_source=bphogan&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=issue-45-markdown-is-holding-you-back" target="_blank">AsciiDoc</a> aims to be human-readable but semantically expressive. It has attributes, conditional content, include mechanisms, and more. </p>
<p>Here's an example of AsciiDoc:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>= Installation
:revnumber: 1.2
:platform: linux
:prev_section: introduction
:next_section: create-project

[source,bash]
----
npm install my-library
----

NOTE: This library requires Node.JS ≥ 22.

See &lt;&lt;usage,Usage Guide&gt;&gt; for examples.
</code></pre></div>
<p>AsciiDoc has native support for document front-matter. Attributes like <code>:revnumber:</code> or <code>:platform:</code> let you parameterize content. </p>
<p><code>&lt;&lt;usage,Usage Guide&gt;&gt;</code> is a cross-reference syntax. </p>
<p>Like reStructuredText, AsciiDoc supports admonitions like <code>NOTE</code> and <code>WARNING</code> so you don't have to build your own custom renderer. It also has support for sidebars, and you can add line highlighting and callouts to your code blocks without additional extensions. </p>
<p>And if you're writing technical documentation, there's explicit support for marking up UI elements and keyboard shortcuts.</p>
<p>Using <a href="https://asciidoctor.org/?utm_source=bphogan&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=issue-45-markdown-is-holding-you-back" target="_blank">AsciiDoctor</a>, you can transform AsciiDoc into other formats, including HTML, PDF, ePub, and DocBook, which you'll look at next.</p>
<h2>DocBook (XML)</h2>
<p><a href="https://docbook.org/?utm_source=bphogan&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=issue-45-markdown-is-holding-you-back" target="_blank">DocBook</a> is an XML-based document model explicitly designed for technical publishing. It expresses hierarchical and semantic structure in tags and attributes, enabling industrial-grade transformations.  </p>
<p>Here's an example</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>&lt;article</span><span> </span><span>id=</span><span>"install-library"</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>  </span><span>&lt;title&gt;</span>Installation<span>&lt;/title&gt;</span>
<span>  </span><span>&lt;command&gt;</span>npm<span> </span>install<span> </span>my-library<span>&lt;/command&gt;</span>
<span>  </span><span>&lt;note&gt;</span>This<span> </span>library<span> </span>requires<span> </span>Node.JS<span> </span><span>&amp;gt;</span>=<span> </span>22<span>&lt;/note&gt;</span>
<span>  </span><span>&lt;xref</span><span> </span><span>linkend=</span><span>"usage-chapter"</span><span>&gt;</span>Usage<span> </span>Guide<span>&lt;/xref&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/article&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Every tag is meaningful: <code>&lt;command&gt;</code> vs <code>&lt;para&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;note&gt;</code> vs <code>&lt;xref&gt;</code>. You'll find predefined tags for function names, variables, application names, keyboard shortcuts, UI elements, and much more. Being able to mark up the specific product names and terminology you use makes it so much easier to create glossaries and indexes. And Docbook has tags for defining index terms, too.</p>
<p>DocBook's rich ecosystem of <a href="https://docbook.org/tools/?utm_source=bphogan&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=issue-45-markdown-is-holding-you-back" target="_blank">XSLT stylesheets</a> supports transforming to HTML, PDF, man pages, and even Markdown. Using DocBook ensures structure and validation at scale, as long as you use the tags it provides.  </p>
<p>Then there's DITA.</p>
<h2>DITA (Darwin Information Typing Architecture)</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.oxygenxml.com/dita/1.3/specs/introduction/dita-release-overview.html?utm_source=bphogan&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=issue-45-markdown-is-holding-you-back" target="_blank">DITA</a> is a standard for writing, managing, and publishing content. It's a topic-based XML architecture with built-in reuse, specialization, and modular content design. It's an open standard, and it's widely used in enterprises for multi-channel, structured content that needs standardization and reuse. </p>
<p>Here's an example:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>&lt;task</span><span> </span><span>id=</span><span>"install"</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>  </span><span>&lt;title&gt;</span>Installation<span>&lt;/title&gt;</span>
<span>  </span><span>&lt;steps&gt;</span>
<span>    </span><span>&lt;step&gt;&lt;cmd&gt;</span>npm<span> </span>install<span> </span>my-library<span>&lt;/cmd&gt;&lt;/step&gt;</span>
<span>  </span><span>&lt;/steps&gt;</span>
<span>  </span><span>&lt;prolog&gt;</span>
<span>    </span><span>&lt;note&gt;</span>This<span> </span>library<span> </span>requires<span> </span>Node.js<span> </span><span>&amp;gt;</span>=<span> </span>22<span>&lt;/note&gt;</span>
<span>  </span><span>&lt;/prolog&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/task&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>DITA defines types like <code>&lt;task&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;step&gt;</code>, which cleanly map to procedural structure. You can compose topics, reuse via content references (conrefs), and specialize as your domain evolves. </p>
<p>One of the more interesting features DITA provides is the ability to <a href="https://blog.oxygenxml.com/presentation-reuse/reuseSimilarProducts.html?utm_source=bphogan&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=issue-45-markdown-is-holding-you-back" target="_blank">filter</a> content and create multiple versions from a single document.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dita-ot.org/?utm_source=bphogan&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=issue-45-markdown-is-holding-you-back" target="_blank">DITA Open Toolkit</a> and many enterprise tools handle rendering, transformation, and reuse pipelines.  </p>
<h2>Ew. XML.</h2>
<p>Yes, XML. The syntax is more verbose than Markdown. Tooling is less ubiquitous than Markdown. Migration requires effort, and your team may resist the learning curve. For small docs, Markdown's features are often enough.</p>
<p>But if you're already bolting semantics onto Markdown with MDX or plugins or custom scripts, you're paying that complexity cost anyway, and you don't get the benefits of standardization or portability. You're building a fragile, custom semantic layer instead of adopting one that already works.</p>
<h2>So where does that leave you?</h2>
<p>If you're writing a quick <code>README</code> or a short-lived doc, Markdown is fine. It's fast, approachable, and does the job. If you're building a developer documentation site that needs some structure, reStructuredText or AsciiDoc are better choices. They balance expressiveness with usability. And if you're managing a large doc set that needs syndication, reuse, and multi-channel publishing, DocBook and DITA give you the semantics and tooling to make that process more manageable.</p>
<p>The key is to start with the richest format you can manage and export downward. Markdown makes a great output for developers. It's approachable and familiar. But be careful not to lock yourself into it as your source of truth, because you can't add context back as easily as you can strip it out.</p>
<h2>Things To Explore</h2>
<ul>
<li>I have a new book out. Check out <a href="http://thevalebook.com/?utm_source=bphogan&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=issue-45-markdown-is-holding-you-back" target="_blank">Write Better with Vale</a>. This book walks you through implementing Vale, the prose linter, on your next writing project to create consistent, quality content.</li>
<li><a href="https://tidewave.ai/?utm_source=bphogan&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=issue-45-markdown-is-holding-you-back" target="_blank">Tidewave.ai</a> is a full-stack coding agent from the creators of the Elixir programming language. It supports Ruby on Rails, Phoenix, and React applications and has a free tier. You'll need an API key for OpenAI, Anthropic, or GitHub Copilot to use it.</li>
<li>Google's Chrome for Developers blog has a post on <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/accessible-carousel?utm_source=bphogan&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=issue-45-markdown-is-holding-you-back" target="_blank">creating accessible carousels</a>. It's worth the read if you have to implement one of these on your site.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Parting Thoughts</h2>
<p>Before the next issue, here are a couple of things you should try to get some hands-on experience with a different format. </p>
<ul>
<li>DocBook and DITA might be too much out of the gate, so explore AsciiDoc. The AsciiDoctor toolchain makes it much less painful to <a href="https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoctor/latest/migrate/markdown/?utm_source=bphogan&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=issue-45-markdown-is-holding-you-back" target="_blank">migrate from Markdown</a>. And there are many <a href="https://gist.github.com/briandominick/e5754cc8438dd9503d936ef65fffbb2d?utm_source=bphogan&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=issue-45-markdown-is-holding-you-back" target="_blank">static site generators that support AsciiDoc</a>, including Hugo.</li>
<li>Then try <a href="https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoctor/latest/docbook-backend/?utm_source=bphogan&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=issue-45-markdown-is-holding-you-back" target="_blank">exporting AsciiDoc content to Docbook</a>.</li>
