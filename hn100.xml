<p>Windows 11 24H2 users are finding there is undeletable data that remains on their devices after installing the recently released feature update.</p>

<p>The known issues list has not grown in the days since the rollout on October 15, however, for many users – this writer included – attempts to clean up the detritus after the update has left 8.63 GB of disk space occupied by "Windows Update Cleanup."</p>
<p>Having file remnants after a Windows update is not unusual, and, according to Microsoft, "Windows keeps copies of all installed updates from Windows Update, even after installing newer versions of updates." Space taken up by the old versions can be reclaimed – at least that's the idea.</p>
<p>The Windows Settings application or the delightfully retro Disk Cleanup tool can be used to clear the temporary files from storage.</p>
<p>However, that 8.63 GB of data appears to persist regardless of how often a user attempts to delete it or restarts Windows 11. A scan of Microsoft's Feedback Hub confirms numerous users are affected.</p>

</ul>
<p><i>El Reg</i> asked Microsoft if it was aware of the problem and when it would be addressed. The Windows vendor has yet to respond - which is pretty much par for the course these days. However, it likely has something to do with how updates are handled in the brave new world of Windows 11 24H2.</p>
<p>In July, Microsoft <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/07/16/microsoft_introduces_checkpoint_cumulative_updates/">said</a> it would implement checkpoint cumulative updates in Windows 11 24H2 and Windows Server 2025. The stated goal of this change is to reduce the size of updates, but a consequence is that a checkpoint is needed from which to start. This is likely the reason why that 8.63 GB appears for some users.</p>

    

<p>The problem is that Windows 11 lists those files as old updates that the user can delete, even when the clean-up tools cannot remove the files. It is possible to remove them manually, but doing so could cause issues when the next set of updates arrive.</p>

        

<p>The need for storage is unlikely to change in the near future. However, the way Windows reports its use will itself need to be updated for the sake of all of those users confused about why they cannot reclaim the space that Windows insists they can. ®</p>

    1 bug, $50,000+ in bounties, how Zendesk intentionally left a backdoor in hundreds of Fortune 500 companies
  </p><div id="file-zendesk-md">
    <article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto">hi, i'm daniel. i'm a 15-year-old with some programming experience and i do a little bug hunting in my free time. here's the insane story of how I found a single bug that affected over half of all Fortune 500 companies:</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 dir="auto">say hello to zendesk</h2><a id="user-content-say-hello-to-zendesk" aria-label="Permalink: say hello to zendesk" href="#say-hello-to-zendesk"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">If you've spent some time online, you’ve probably come across Zendesk.</p>
<p dir="auto">Zendesk is a customer service tool used by some of the world’s top companies. It’s easy to set up: you link it to your company’s support email (like <a href="mailto:support@company.com">support@company.com</a>), and Zendesk starts managing incoming emails and creating tickets. You can handle these tickets yourself or have a support team do it for you. Zendesk is a billion-dollar company, trusted by big names like Cloudflare.</p>
<p dir="auto">Personally, I’ve always found it surprising that these massive companies, worth billions, rely on third-party tools like Zendesk instead of building their own in-house ticketing systems.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 dir="auto">your weakest link</h2><a id="user-content-your-weakest-link" aria-label="Permalink: your weakest link" href="#your-weakest-link"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">As the saying goes, “You’re only as strong as your weakest link.” Since Zendesk is just seen as a basic ticketing tool, companies often set it up without much thought. The most common setup I've seen is is forwarding all emails from <code>support@company.com</code> to Zendesk.</p>
<p dir="auto">Why is that dangerous? Many companies use their @company.com domain for Single Sign-On (SSO), which lets employees quickly log in to internal tools. By connecting Zendesk to the same domain, companies unknowingly create a potential security gap. Zendesk handles all emails for the domain it’s configured for, which means if your SSO system doesn’t properly validate email addresses, anyone who gains access to your Zendesk could potentially exploit this and access your internal systems. (I’ll explain more on this later.)</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 dir="auto">email spoofing</h2><a id="user-content-email-spoofing" aria-label="Permalink: email spoofing" href="#email-spoofing"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">At the beginning of the year, I discovered a serious vulnerability in Zendesk that allowed attackers to read customer support tickets from any company using Zendesk. All they had to do was sent a crafted email to a Support email handled by Zendesk. The shocking part? Zendesk didn’t seem to care.</p>
<p dir="auto">The bug itself was surprisingly simple. Zendesk had no effective protection against email spoofing, and this oversight made it possible to exploit their email collaboration feature to gain access to others’ tickets.</p>
<p dir="auto">Here’s how it worked: When you send an email to a company’s Zendesk support portal (e.g., <code>support@company.com</code>), Zendesk creates a new support ticket. To keep track of the email thread, Zendesk automatically generates a reply-to address, which looks like this: <code>support+id{id}@company.com</code>, where <code>{id}</code> is the unique ticket number. This address ensures that any future replies you send go directly to the same ticket.</p>
<p dir="auto">Zendesk also has a feature for ticket collaboration. If you CC someone on one of your email replies, Zendesk automatically adds them to the ticket, allowing them to see the full ticket history in the support portal.</p>
<p dir="auto">The exploit was simple: if an attacker knew the support email address and the ticket ID (which are usually easy to guess since ticket IDs are incremental), they could use email spoofing to impersonate the original sender. By sending a fake email to <code>support+id{id}@company.com</code> from the requestor’s email address and CCing their own email, Zendesk would think the email was legitimate. It would then add the attacker’s email to the ticket, giving them full access to the entire ticket history.</p>
<p dir="auto">This meant an attacker could effectively join any ongoing support conversation, and read sensitive information—all because Zendesk didn’t have proper safeguards against email spoofing.</p>
<p dir="auto">Bug Prerequisites:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Requestor's email</li>
<li>The ticket ID (since Zendesk ticket IDs are incremental, an attacker could brute-force or estimate it)</li>
<li>Access to a public support portal</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 dir="auto">"out of scope," said no attacker ever</h2><a id="user-content-out-of-scope-said-no-attacker-ever" aria-label="Permalink: &quot;out of scope,&quot; said no attacker ever" href="#out-of-scope-said-no-attacker-ever"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">As soon as I discovered this vulnerability, I reported it through Zendesk’s bug bounty program, fully expecting it to be taken seriously and fixed quickly. A week later, I was hit with a disappointing response:

<p dir="auto">Because my bug relied on email spoofing, which was considered "out of scope" for their HackerOne program, they rejected my report. It was unbelievable.</p>
<p dir="auto">This response wasn’t even from an actual Zendesk team member. Many companies, like Zendesk, use a HackerOne service to triage reports so their own team can focus on fixing bugs instead of verifying submissions. Realizing this, I asked for the report to be forwarded to an actual Zendesk staff member for review. A few days later, I got another frustrating reply:</p>

<p dir="auto">Zendesk refused to reconsider. Despite the security risk, they wouldn’t act on the report because it fell outside their program’s scope. Of course, they’d change their minds in a few weeks—but more on that later.</p>

<p dir="auto">I could have reported the email spoofing bug to individual companies that were affected by it, as it was possible to patch individual instances by disabling email collaboration, prevent attackers from adding themselves to tickets. But I wanted to make a bigger impact.</p>
<p dir="auto">That's when I came across <a href="https://medium.com/intigriti/how-i-hacked-hundreds-of-companies-through-their-helpdesk-b7680ddc2d4c" rel="nofollow">TICKETTRICK</a>, a blog post from 2017. In it, security researcher Inti De Ceukelaire detailed how he exploited Zendesk to infiltrate the private Slack workspaces of hundreds of companies. Since many companies use Slack SSO on the same domain as Zendesk, the researcher figured out he could complete email verifications through a <code>support@company.com</code> email, and gain access to private Slack channels. Back then, Zendesk wasn't as big and there were some bugs that allowed anyone to view your tickets if they had your email.</p>
<p dir="auto">I realized that I could replicate his exploit using my bug, but with a few challenges to overcome.</p>

<p dir="auto">Inti's exploit (like mine) required the attacker to know the sending email address of the verification code. Slack added random tokens to their email addresses to combat similar attacks in the future. It was impossible to know what email they would send the verification email from (which is one of the prerequisites required for my exploit) as they generated a random token everytime. Unless...</p>
<p dir="auto">While Slack used a random email token when sending email verification, neither Google or Apple did. Slack supported both methods for OAuth login.</p>

<p dir="auto">It was the most simple bypass. Slack intoduced OAuth login just a few years ago and must have completely forgotten about their protections against this type of attacks.</p>
<p dir="auto">So now the exploit was simple, create a Google account with a <code>support@company.com</code> email, request verification code, use my bug to access the ticket Zendesk automatically creates when it arrives, verify Google account, login with Google to Slack.</p>
<p dir="auto">This was perfect...except it wouldn't work with Google. Google sent verification email from <code>noreply@google.com</code> and Zendesk had started blocking emails from <code>noreply@</code> addresses from being automatically created as tickets (probably after the TICKETTRICK disclosure too) which meant we wouldn't be able to recieve it.</p>
<p dir="auto">Apple didn't do this though, Apple sent verification emails from <code>appleid@</code> address, jackpot.

<p dir="auto">I couldn’t help but find it amusing—they were now asking me to keep the report confidential, despite having initially dismissed it as out of scope.</p>
<p dir="auto">Some companies must have contacted Zendesk after recieving my report and the pressure from this issue had essentially forced Zendesk’s hand. I hadn’t mentioned the Slack exploit in my original report to them because I hadn’t discovered it at that point, now they wanted full detailed reproduction steps for the Slack takeover.</p>
<p dir="auto">I provided the proof of concept for the Slack vulnerability, and they confirmed the issue. Though they claimed they had "started working" on a fix, it would actually take them over two months to resolve it.</p>

<p dir="auto">Once companies vulnerable to this were alerted to the issue, many of them quickly disabled Zendesk’s email collaboration feature to protect their instances. Over the course of my reporting, I earned more than $50,000 in bounties from individual companies on HackerOne and other platforms.</p>
<p dir="auto">Unsurprisingly, Zendesk didn’t come out of this looking good. At least one or two companies reportedly cut ties with Zendesk after my disclosure, canceling their agreements altogether.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 dir="auto">zendesk's fix (and my $0 bounty)</h2><a id="user-content-zendesks-fix-and-my-0-bounty" aria-label="Permalink: zendesk's fix (and my $0 bounty)" href="#zendesks-fix-and-my-0-bounty"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">On July 2, 2024—two months after I submitted the report—Zendesk finally confirmed that they had fixed the issue. Here’s a statement from their Offensive Security Leader:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">In most cases, when an end user submits a support request by email, the email becomes a new ticket or adds a comment to an existing ticket. However, in certain cases, the email may be suspended. Suspending an email means putting it aside for further review. It's not necessarily spam. It's just not a ticket in Zendesk Support yet. It remains in limbo until somebody reviews it and decides whether to accept or reject it.
We use two spam filters, Cloudmark and Rspamd EAP to help determine suspicious characteristics in messages. Depending on the score received by these tools, messages may be suspended. If you are curious, we publish a full list of causes for ticket suspension.
In the attack scenario explained here, Cloudmark had very low spam scores of while RSpamD had very high spam scores; unfortunately we weren’t using the RSpamD score in this case, otherwise many of the emails would have been suspended and limited the ability to add CCs at all. The first fix we implemented was to Automatically switch to RSPAMD spam analysis when:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Our automatic ticket threading is triggered to thread an new email into a existing ticket and;</li>
<li>We haven’t previously suspended the message due to the Cloudmark score.
In addition to this, we also implemented filters to automatically suspend the following classes of emails:
User verification emails sent by Apple based on the Reply-To and Message-Id header values
Non-transactional emails from from <a href="mailto:googleworkspace-noreply@google.com">googleworkspace-noreply@google.com</a>
Over the coming months, we will continue to look into opportunities to strengthen our Sender Authentication functionality and provide customers with more gradual and advanced security controls over the types of emails that get suspended or rejected.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Despite fixing the issue, Zendesk ultimately chose not to award a bounty for my report. Their reasoning? I had broken HackerOne's disclosure guidelines by sharing the vulnerability with affected companies. I didn’t bother to argue :)</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 dir="auto">conclusion</h2><a id="user-content-conclusion" aria-label="Permalink: conclusion" href="#conclusion"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">What started as a small email bug turned into an exploit that allowed me to infiltrate the internal systems of some of the world’s largest companies. While Zendesk eventually fixed the vulnerability, the journey to get there was a frustrating mix of rejections, slow responses, and ultimately no recognition for the report. But that’s the reality of bug hunting—sometimes you win, sometimes you don’t.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>MILAN — Psilocybin leads to a better overall outcome in the treatment of moderate to severe major depressive disorder (MDD) than the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) <a href="https://reference.medscape.com/drug/lexapro-escitalopram-342961">escitalopram</a>, results of the first long-term comparison of the two treatments suggest.</p><p>"This is the first work to compare the long-term effects of these two drugs in the context of overall well-being, not just freedom from <a href="https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/286759-overview">depression</a>," study investigator Tommaso Barba, PhD, candidate Imperial College London, London, England, said in a press release. "Psilocybin outperformed escitalopram in several measures of well-being, meaning in life, work, and social functioning."</p><p>Findings from the 6-month follow-up study of a phase 2 double-blind, randomized, controlled trial were presented on September 22 at the 37th European College of Neuropsychopharmacology (ECNP) Congress and <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(24)00378-X/fulltext">published simultaneously in <em>The Lancet eClinicalMedicine</em>.</a></p><h2><strong>Addressing a Treatment 'Mismatch'</strong></h2><p>The findings are important because they address "a mismatch" between what psychiatrists and what patients think is important, Barba told <em>Medscape Medical News</em>.</p><p>"Psychiatrists really focus on negative symptoms of depression. So, if you are not sad anymore, if your sleep or appetite is not impaired, they think you're better. But if you look at what patients define as important, they say it's the degree in which their life is meaningful, in which they can connect with people around them, in which they can function in everyday life," Barba said.</p><p>"The study suggests that psilocybin therapy might be a more holistic treatment option for depression," added co-first author David Erritzoe, MD, PhD, clinical director and deputy head of the Centre for Psychedelic Research, Imperial College London. "This could make a substantial difference in the overall happiness and daily activities of those suffering from depression, providing a more joined-up approach to mental health treatment."</p><p>The <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2032994">initial single-center study</a> included 59 adults with MDD (mean age, 41 years) who were randomized to receive either psilocybin or escitalopram over a 6-week period. The psilocybin arm (n = 30) received two 25-mg oral doses of psilocybin therapy (PT), and the escitalopram arm (n = 29) received 10-20 mg of daily escitalopram plus two (placebo-like) 1-mg doses of psilocybin (ET). Both groups received psychological support.</p><p>Based on change in depression scores on the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report (QIDS-SR-16) at week 6, the initial study results suggested non-inferiority between the two treatments in terms of depressive symptoms (primary outcome), but superiority of PT for secondary outcomes including "well-being, anhedonia, social functioning, sexual functioning, and related variables, with fewer side effects compared to ET," the researchers noted.</p><p>The new 6-month follow-up findings, with monthly questionnaires and no additional study treatment or psychiatric treatment restrictions, measured the QIDS-SR-16, plus Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS), Meaning in Life Questionnaire, Flourishing Scale (FS), and Watts Connectedness Scale (WCS).</p><p>Again, both groups maintained similar results on the QIDS-SR-16, with slightly greater reductions in depressive symptoms for PT in the first month (positive false discovery rate [FDR] = 0.021), but not thereafter.</p><p>At both 3 and 6 months, there were greater improvements in WSAS scores for the PT group (pFDR &lt; 0.001 and pFDR = 0.01, respectively), and also greater improvements in meaning in life across all follow-up timepoints (pFDR &lt; 0.001).</p><p>There was also greater improvement in the PT group regarding WCS at both 3 and 6 months (pFDR = 0.02, and pFDR = 0.04) and comparable FS improvements for both groups across all timepoints.</p><p>Confounding follow-up interventions may have muddied the results, with 30.7% of PT participants and 43.5% of ET participants receiving an additional intervention during this period.</p><p>The researchers conclude that while a short course of SSRIs combined with intensive therapeutic support (around 20 hours) "might be enough to induce sustained antidepressant effects," patients treated with psilocybin showed greater improvements in general functioning, connectedness, and meaning in life.</p><p>Although not reassessed in the follow-up, the initial study showed that adverse events, particularly sexual functioning, favored psilocybin, said Barba. "The two treatments seemed to go in opposite directions with psilocybin seeming to improve it and the antidepressant to suppress it. Other side effects associated with psilocybin were less diverse — mainly headaches at the end of the day — but with escitalopram they were way more diverse and more impairing," he added.</p><p>Although many therapists may be unfamiliar with psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy, "it's not a difficult skill to master. It might require some specialization, but I think if you're a good psychotherapist, you can learn how to implement psilocybin into your practice," he said.</p><p>"Normally the journey is quite inward, so patients do not require active support during the psychedelic experience [around 6 hours]. Sometimes they do require some hand-holding, or helping them to 'let go', or breathing exercises. The important part is the integration work that comes afterwards," Barba added.</p><p>He said he envisions a therapy program that involves "psychiatrists working together with psychotherapists. The psychotherapists would be more in charge of the active guiding, and the psychiatrist would do the prescribing, with the follow-up psychological support on Zoom."</p><p>He added a word of caution for therapists that "psilocybin requires active confrontation of painful, negative emotions and people who take this drug need to be open and prepared for the idea that they are going into a state where they may probably end up crying and confronting whatever they are maybe running away from in their lives. Not everyone may want to do this."</p><h2><strong>A New Treatment Paradigm?</strong></h2><p>Commenting on the research for <em>Medscape Medical News</em>, Johan Lundberg, MD, PhD, adjunct professor of psychiatry at the Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden, said the study addresses a key outstanding question about the long-term effects of one or two doses of psilocybin.</p><p>"It's a 6-month follow-up of a short treatment intervention, so in that sense, it's of high interest. It has been talked about that psilocybin might have a long-term effect, but this is the first study that has followed this for a longer term."</p><p>But Lundberg also pointed out that one shortcoming of the study is the diversity of treatments following the intervention.</p><p>"They didn't have control over whether patients received other treatments or when they started. So, that is a key concern. But they transparently reported that, and we do know there was a difference in reported ability to perform activities of daily life, and that is important."</p><p>He added that if psilocybin is eventually approved, it would likely come with an education package for providers — "which is already the case with other treatments like ECT [<a href="https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1525957-overview">electroconvulsive therapy</a>] or TMS [transcranial magnetic stimulation] — you have to learn how to do it."</p><p>James Rucker, MD, PhD, psychiatrist and senior clinical lecturer at King's College London, London, England, who was not involved in the research, also noted that they have tended to attribute differences observed in this study to comparative differences between the drugs themselves.</p><p>However, he noted, it is also possible that the results reflect biased reporting between groups. This is more likely here because studies involving psilocybin tend to attract those with positive preconceptions about psilocybin and negative preconceptions about conventional antidepressants, and study participants were unblinded during the long-term follow-up phase, so knew which condition they were allocated to.</p><p>"This said, the nature of depression varies hugely between individuals, and this calls for the development of a similarly varied suite of treatment paradigms. Psilocybin therapy is certainly a different paradigm of treatment to escitalopram. The observation of similar levels of effectiveness to antidepressants here is encouraging to see alongside the much larger trials of psilocybin currently underway here in the UK, Europe, and the US," Rucker added.</p><p><em>This work was supported by The Alexander Mosley Charitable Trust and by the founding partners of Imperial College London's Centre for Psychedelic Research.</em></p><p><em>Barba reported having received consulting fees from Adamo Bioscience.</em></p><p><em>Both Lundberg and Rucker are involved in psilocybin research, but neither reported financial links.</em></p>

<li>Google is developing a Linux terminal app for Android.</li>
<li>The Terminal app can be enabled via developer options and will install Debian in a virtual machine.</li>
<li>This app is likely intended for Chromebooks but might also be available for mobile devices, too.</li>
</ul>
</div><p>Although a lot of work can be done in a web browser these days, some tasks still require installing apps that aren’t available on <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/what-is-chrome-os-1137371/">Chrome OS</a>, which is why Google lets you install <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/linux-on-chromebook-1139944/">Linux apps on your Chromebook</a>. While there are ways to run some Linux apps on Android devices, all of those methods have some limitations and aren’t officially supported by Google. Fortunately, though, Google is finally working on an official way to run Linux apps on Android.</p><p>You're reading an&nbsp;<b data-stringify-type="bold">Authority Insights</b>&nbsp;story.

This Terminal app is part of the Android Virtualization Framework (AVF) and contains a WebView that connects to a Linux virtual machine via a local IP address, allowing you to run Linux commands from the Android host. Initially, you had to manually enable this Terminal app using a shell command and then configure the Linux VM yourself. However, in recent days, Google began work on integrating the Terminal app into Android as well as turning it into an all-in-one app for running a Linux distro in a VM.</p><p>A set of patches under the tag “<code>ferrochrome-dev-option</code>” was recently submitted to <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/aosp-explained-1093505/">AOSP</a> that adds a new developer option called <strong>Linux terminal</strong> under <strong>Settings &gt; System &gt; Developer options</strong>. This new option will enable a “Linux terminal app that runs inside the VM,” according to its proposed description. Toggling this option enables the Terminal app that’s bundled with AVF.</p><div><picture><source sizes="(min-width: 64rem) 51.25rem, 80vw" srcset="https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Android_Linux_Terminal_app.jpeg.webp 1116w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Android_Linux_Terminal_app-879w-1440h.jpeg.webp 879w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Android_Linux_Terminal_app-659w-1080h.jpeg.webp 659w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Android_Linux_Terminal_app-527w-864h.jpeg.webp 527w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Android_Linux_Terminal_app-232w-380h.jpeg.webp 232w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Android_Linux_Terminal_app-39w-64h.jpeg.webp 39w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Android_Linux_Terminal_app-1000w-1639h.jpeg.webp 1000w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Android_Linux_Terminal_app-675w-1106h.jpeg.webp 675w" type="image/webp"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 64rem) 51.25rem, 80vw" title="Android Linux Terminal app" srcset="https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Android_Linux_Terminal_app.jpeg 1116w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Android_Linux_Terminal_app-879w-1440h.jpeg 879w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Android_Linux_Terminal_app-659w-1080h.jpeg 659w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Android_Linux_Terminal_app-527w-864h.jpeg 527w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Android_Linux_Terminal_app-232w-380h.jpeg 232w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Android_Linux_Terminal_app-39w-64h.jpeg 39w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Android_Linux_Terminal_app-1000w-1639h.jpeg 1000w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Android_Linux_Terminal_app-675w-1106h.jpeg 675w" alt="Android Linux Terminal app" src="https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Android_Linux_Terminal_app.jpeg"></picture></div><p>Currently, Android’s Terminal app still requires you to manually configure the Linux VM by providing a Debian image and creating a <code>vm_config.json</code> file, but Google plans to upgrade the Terminal app to take care of that for you. In one of the patches under the “<code>ferrochrome-dev-option</code>” tag, Google says that the existing “LinuxInstaller” app, which downloads and configures Debian to run in a VM through AVF, will be “merged to [the] terminal app soon.” This suggests that the Terminal app will become an all-in-one app that downloads, configures, runs, and interfaces with an instance of Debian running in a VM.</p><div><picture><source sizes="(min-width: 64rem) 51.25rem, 80vw" srcset="https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/AOSP_patch_to_add_Terminal_app_to_developer_options.jpg.webp 1497w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/AOSP_patch_to_add_Terminal_app_to_developer_options-675w-203h.jpg.webp 675w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/AOSP_patch_to_add_Terminal_app_to_developer_options-64w-19h.jpg.webp 64w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/AOSP_patch_to_add_Terminal_app_to_developer_options-1000w-301h.jpg.webp 1000w" type="image/webp"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 64rem) 51.25rem, 80vw" title="AOSP patch to add Terminal app to developer options" srcset="https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/AOSP_patch_to_add_Terminal_app_to_developer_options.jpg 1497w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/AOSP_patch_to_add_Terminal_app_to_developer_options-675w-203h.jpg 675w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/AOSP_patch_to_add_Terminal_app_to_developer_options-64w-19h.jpg 64w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/AOSP_patch_to_add_Terminal_app_to_developer_options-1000w-301h.jpg 1000w" alt="AOSP patch to add Terminal app to developer options" src="https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/AOSP_patch_to_add_Terminal_app_to_developer_options.jpg"></picture><div><p>Mishaal Rahman / Android Authority</p></div></div><p>Google is still working on improving the Terminal app as well as AVF before shipping this feature. AVF already supports graphics and some input options, but it’s preparing to add support for backing up and restoring snapshots, nested virtualization, and devices with an x86_64 architecture. It’s also preparing to add some settings pages to the Terminal app, which is pretty barebones right now apart from a menu to copy the IP address and stop the existing VM instance. The settings pages will let you resize the disk, configure port forwarding, and potentially recover partitions.</p><div><picture><source sizes="(min-width: 64rem) 51.25rem, 80vw" srcset="https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/AOSP_patch_to_add_settings_to_Terminal_app.jpg.webp 1531w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/AOSP_patch_to_add_settings_to_Terminal_app-675w-224h.jpg.webp 675w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/AOSP_patch_to_add_settings_to_Terminal_app-64w-21h.jpg.webp 64w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/AOSP_patch_to_add_settings_to_Terminal_app-1000w-331h.jpg.webp 1000w" type="image/webp"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 64rem) 51.25rem, 80vw" title="AOSP patch to add settings to Terminal app" srcset="https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/AOSP_patch_to_add_settings_to_Terminal_app.jpg 1531w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/AOSP_patch_to_add_settings_to_Terminal_app-675w-224h.jpg 675w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/AOSP_patch_to_add_settings_to_Terminal_app-64w-21h.jpg 64w, https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/AOSP_patch_to_add_settings_to_Terminal_app-1000w-331h.jpg 1000w" alt="AOSP patch to add settings to Terminal app" src="https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/AOSP_patch_to_add_settings_to_Terminal_app.jpg"></picture><div><p>Mishaal Rahman / Android Authority</p></div></div><p>What’s particularly interesting about the patch that adds these settings is that it was tested on “tangorpro” and “komodo,” the codenames for the Pixel Tablet and Pixel 9 Pro XL respectively. This suggests that the Terminal app won’t be limited to Chromebooks like the new <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/desktop-chrome-android-extensions-3488455/">desktop versions of Chrome for Android</a>. I don’t know when the Terminal app will land, but it’s possible we could see it arrive in next year’s <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-16-features-3484159/">Android 16</a> update.</p><p>Here’s an early look at how this could work, courtesy of an anonymous developer. What you see below features the current version of the Terminal app, which lacks some of the automations we’re expecting. That’s why you’ll see LinuxInstaller involved at the beginning here, to help set things up:</p><p>If you’re wondering why you’d want to run Linux apps on Android, then this feature is probably not for you. Google added Linux support to Chrome OS so developers with Chromebooks can run Linux apps that are useful for development. For example, Linux support on Chrome OS allows developers to run the Linux version of Android Studio, the recommended IDE for Android app development, on Chromebooks. It also lets them run Linux command line tools safely and securely in a container.</p><p>Most Chromebooks have x86-based processors, as opposed to most Android devices which have ARM-based ones, so a lot of Linux apps that work on most Chromebooks (like Android Studio) might not work on most Android devices. Still, adding support for Linux apps will greatly improve the utility of Android to developers and make it more viable as a desktop-class platform in the future, especially as more and more apps add support for ARM. Plus, it’s necessary for Google to do as <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/chrome-os-adopts-android-stack-3451177/">Chrome OS is becoming more like Android</a>, which means it’s adopting more and more of Android’s architecture and frameworks.</p><p><strong>Got a tip?

This is important to me because my work on WordPress represents the MariaDB Foundation, my login uses my Foundation email address. Not only do I not want to be tied-up in legal issues, but I do not want to be responsible for dragging the MariaDB Foundation into them.</p><p>It is also very difficult for me to know if the MariaDB Foundation has a loose affiliation with WP Engine. Sure, I know they aren’t a direct sponsor, but they may be financially tied to one of our sponsors. As I am paid by the MariaDB Foundation, this could financially tie me.</p><p>I needed clarification on this before I could proceed. Others asking questions have clients who host on WP Engine, or use paid-for plugins created by WP Engine. They also needed similar clarification.</p><h2>The Discussion</h2><p>The discussion happened on Slack, and a majority of it that I’m aware about can be seen in the Twitter thread below.</p><figure></figure><p>It continued on a little bit afterwards. Matt emphasised that the value of the checkbox is not stored, and that many people had logged in since the checkbox was added. I pointed out that although the value may not be directly stored, by his own admission, it has been logged who has signed in since the mandatory checkbox was added, so it is effectively stored.</p><p>Shortly after this, my Slack session reset to another instance, and I was confused for a minute as to what happened. I then realised I had been kicked and banned from the server. I attempted to log in to Slack today just to confirm it was still in place. The system sent me this email when I tried.</p><figure><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSIxMDI0IiBoZWlnaHQ9IjUyOSIgdmlld0JveD0iMCAwIDEwMjQgNTI5Ij48cmVjdCB3aWR0aD0iMTAwJSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxMDAlIiBzdHlsZT0iZmlsbDojY2ZkNGRiO2ZpbGwtb3BhY2l0eTogMC4xOyIvPjwvc3ZnPg==" decoding="async" width="1024" height="529" data-src="https://linuxjedi.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot_20241011_062231-1024x529.png" alt="" data-srcset="https://linuxjedi.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot_20241011_062231-1024x529.png 1024w, https://linuxjedi.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot_20241011_062231-300x155.png 300w, https://linuxjedi.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot_20241011_062231-768x397.png 768w, https://linuxjedi.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot_20241011_062231-1536x794.png 1536w, https://linuxjedi.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot_20241011_062231.png 1879w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><h2>My Thoughts</h2><p>I don’t think we had a resolution to our questions, and the checkbox remains in place. Several people have stated that they will not sign in until there has been some proper legal clarification. WP Engine said this:</p><figure><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSI1ODciIGhlaWdodD0iMjA2IiB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgNTg3IDIwNiI+PHJlY3Qgd2lkdGg9IjEwMCUiIGhlaWdodD0iMTAwJSIgc3R5bGU9ImZpbGw6I2NmZDRkYjtmaWxsLW9wYWNpdHk6IDAuMTsiLz48L3N2Zz4=" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="587" height="206" data-src="https://linuxjedi.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot_20241011_073923.png" alt="" data-srcset="https://linuxjedi.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot_20241011_073923.png 587w, https://linuxjedi.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot_20241011_073923-300x105.png 300w" data-sizes="(max-width: 587px) 100vw, 587px"></figure><p>I’m not fully convinced that this protects everyone. The WordPress Twitter account responded with:</p><figure><img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSI1OTIiIGhlaWdodD0iNjkzIiB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgNTkyIDY5MyI+PHJlY3Qgd2lkdGg9IjEwMCUiIGhlaWdodD0iMTAwJSIgc3R5bGU9ImZpbGw6I2NmZDRkYjtmaWxsLW9wYWNpdHk6IDAuMTsiLz48L3N2Zz4=" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="592" height="693" data-src="https://linuxjedi.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot_20241011_073937.png" alt="" data-srcset="https://linuxjedi.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot_20241011_073937.png 592w, https://linuxjedi.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot_20241011_073937-256x300.png 256w" data-sizes="(max-width: 592px) 100vw, 592px"></figure><p>I have to say, I love that reader context is still a thing, I’m very surprised the current owner of Twitter did not kill it.</p><p>The MariaDB Foundation is a non-profit, any legal representation would be prohibitively expensive for us. So, I’d rather err on the side of not logging in until it is clear I am safe.</p><h2>Does This Matter?</h2><p>I am a small fry in this, not very important. My contributions mostly go as far as helping out with WordPress database questions, and often via other communication methods. I meet a lot of people face to face in the community and advise on how things could be better, things like that. My personal ban is not that important.</p><p>Several people who were banned at the same time are more important to the community. Having their voices taken away in this way is more damaging. I guess this is the start of the fallout from going nuclear that was talked about at the beginning of the fight.</p><p>I think clarification matters, this Tweet from Anita, quoting Uncle Chuck, says perfectly what I was thinking at the time:</p><figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Having coffee with Uncle Chuck (CGPT) 😂☕️ and he said:</p><p>You raise some valid points about the ambiguity of the checkbox. If people are asking Matt Mullenweg for clarification, it indicates a broader concern within the WordPress community about the implications of this statement,…</p></div>— Anita (@TheCre8tiveDiva) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheCre8tiveDiva/status/1843997862943666607?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 9, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure><h2>Wider Thoughts</h2><p>I think I speak for many in the WordPress community / ecosystem when I say that we don’t want to take sides in this battle. We don’t want to be forced to take sides via a checkbox. We just want to get work done, to improve WordPress for everyone.</p><p>The WordPress community is one of the most welcoming communities I’ve ever been a part of. It has brought friendship, meaning and value to many people. I want to see it succeed.</p><p>One of the things I have said since the beginning of me becoming Chief Contributions Officer is that contributions aren’t just code. Documentation, events, translations, community building, testing, bug reports, just so many things make up important contributions in an open source project. You don’t have to be a coder to contribute. I have seen these values expressed more in the WordPress community than anywhere else.</p><p>I cannot take a side in this battle, for several reasons. Not least because I have friends employed by both sides of it. But I would love for the collateral damage to stop. So that the community can heal.</p><p>I’ve said publicly, I would much rather my ban be permanent for asking the difficult questions and restore the voice to others who are more important. I’m not sure how I can help the community, but in some small way, I will be there for it.</p></div></div>]]></description>

the desktop Zen 5 parts. And the reason for this is the 9575F has GMI3-W which means that it has 2 GMI links to the IO die instead of the single GMI link that the 9950X gets.</p><p>And this is not only the only change to the GMI links on server. The GMI write link is now 32B per GMI link instead of the 16B per GMI link that you’d see on desktop Zen 5.</p><p>Before moving to the full socket memory performance for the 9575F, let’s clear up the memory speeds that Turin supports. Turin has 12 channels of memory that can run up to DDR5-6400MT/s, however 6400MT/s is only supported on specific validated systems and only for 1 DIMM per channel. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3d1550a-b7b7-4888-bb36-bf54901e2823_675x724.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3d1550a-b7b7-4888-bb36-bf54901e2823_675x724.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3d1550a-b7b7-4888-bb36-bf54901e2823_675x724.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3d1550a-b7b7-4888-bb36-bf54901e2823_675x724.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3d1550a-b7b7-4888-bb36-bf54901e2823_675x724.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3d1550a-b7b7-4888-bb36-bf54901e2823_675x724.png" width="675" height="724" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a3d1550a-b7b7-4888-bb36-bf54901e2823_675x724.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:724,&quot;width&quot;:675,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:275928,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3d1550a-b7b7-4888-bb36-bf54901e2823_675x724.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3d1550a-b7b7-4888-bb36-bf54901e2823_675x724.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3d1550a-b7b7-4888-bb36-bf54901e2823_675x724.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3d1550a-b7b7-4888-bb36-bf54901e2823_675x724.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>The system we had access to was running 6000MT/s for its memory, and DDR5-6000 MT/s is what most systems will support in a 1 DIMM per channel configuration.

Not only does AMD have high core count SKUs (9755, 9965), which the hyperscalers will be picking up, they now also have lower core count, very high frequency SKUs (9575F) which the traditional enterprise market will appreciate. Apparently we now think 64 cores is ‘lower core count’. What a world we live in.</p><p>Turin isn’t the step-function revolution that Naples to Rome was; it’s more akin to the evolution we saw with Milan to Genoa, which was a memory bandwidth increase, a core increase, and a core update.

<p dir="auto">Swarm focuses on making agent <strong>coordination</strong> and <strong>execution</strong> lightweight, highly controllable, and easily testable.</p>
<p dir="auto">It accomplishes this through two primitive abstractions: <code>Agent</code>s and <strong>handoffs</strong>. An <code>Agent</code> encompasses <code>instructions</code> and <code>tools</code>, and can at any point choose to hand off a conversation to another <code>Agent</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">These primitives are powerful enough to express rich dynamics between tools and networks of agents, allowing you to build scalable, real-world solutions while avoiding a steep learning curve.</p>
<div dir="auto"><p dir="auto">Note</p><p dir="auto">Swarm Agents are not related to Assistants in the Assistants API. They are named similarly for convenience, but are otherwise completely unrelated. Swarm is entirely powered by the Chat Completions API and is hence stateless between calls.</p>
</div>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why Swarm</h2><a id="user-content-why-swarm" aria-label="Permalink: Why Swarm" href="#why-swarm"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Swarm explores patterns that are lightweight, scalable, and highly customizable by design. Approaches similar to Swarm are best suited for situations dealing with a large number of independent capabilities and instructions that are difficult to encode into a single prompt.</p>
<p dir="auto">The Assistants API is a great option for developers looking for fully-hosted threads and built in memory management and retrieval. However, Swarm is an educational resource for developers curious to learn about multi-agent orchestration. Swarm runs (almost) entirely on the client and, much like the Chat Completions API, does not store state between calls.</p>

<p dir="auto">Start by instantiating a Swarm client (which internally just instantiates an <code>OpenAI</code> client).</p>

<p dir="auto">Swarm's <code>run()</code> function is analogous to the <code>chat.completions.create()</code> function in the Chat Completions API – it takes <code>messages</code> and returns <code>messages</code> and saves no state between calls. Importantly, however, it also handles Agent function execution, hand-offs, context variable references, and can take multiple turns before returning to the user.</p>
<p dir="auto">At its core, Swarm's <code>client.run()</code> implements the following loop:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Get a completion from the current Agent</li>
<li>Execute tool calls and append results</li>
<li>Switch Agent if necessary</li>
<li>Update context variables, if necessary</li>
<li>If no new function calls, return</li>

You can pass these values (plus new user messages) in to your next execution of <code>client.run()</code> to continue the interaction where it left off – much like <code>chat.completions.create()</code>.

<p dir="auto">An <code>Agent</code> simply encapsulates a set of <code>instructions</code> with a set of <code>functions</code> (plus some additional settings below), and has the capability to hand off execution to another <code>Agent</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">While it's tempting to personify an <code>Agent</code> as "someone who does X", it can also be used to represent a very specific workflow or step defined by a set of <code>instructions</code> and <code>functions</code> (e.g. a set of steps, a complex retrieval, single step of data transformation, etc). This allows <code>Agent</code>s to be composed into a network of "agents", "workflows", and "tasks", all represented by the same primitive.</p>

Over the course of 10 years, Straight walked more than a half-million steps while paralyzed, helping to pioneer a field.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SCJKE5QQZ5DUHOCL77RKMO6FOA" data-el="text" dir="null">But in June, his machine stopped working, and the manufacturer refused to repair it.

Repeatedly, company employees told him they were no longer doing maintenance on machines more than five years old and then connected him with phone lines where he left voicemail messages that were never returned.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="E56SDYBYORCFHOSCLAYE7GWJUA" data-el="text" dir="null">Calling Straight “a real pioneer,” Lifeward CEO Larry Jasinski apologized Friday for the company’s response to the maintenance requests. He said that the company is no longer repairing exoskeletons older than five years because the Food and Drug Administration, which regulates the devices, has approved their usage for that timespan.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LIBVQBWS4JENLGR4657FTJOHKU" data-el="text" dir="null">But, he added, when he realized that repairing Straight’s exoskeleton was minor and would not have a material impact on the machine’s structure, he overnighted him a replacement watch.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FFJOX5WPMFDT3PKS37UENOLSWE" data-el="text" dir="null">“We didn’t do this one perfectly, and I’m sorry for that,” Jasinski said.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NIDQKWZQRVHB3IGCJLU6GD5T2Y" data-el="text" dir="null">Straight’s path to paralysis started in the 1990s at the Saratoga Race Course, one of the most famous thoroughbred horse racetracks in the country. His grandparents took Straight and his twin brother to the track in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., for the first time when they were about 7 years old, the start of a childhood surrounded by horse racing. The boys were obsessed with becoming jockeys.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OBG4OCX5VJBHBPSMYLLGBO26OI" data-el="text" dir="null">“We were around it our whole life, so it’s definitely something we always dreamed about doing,” he said.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KBDDCGV5WZCTNBEDUWUVHFJ4JQ" data-el="text" dir="null">In the mid-2000s, Straight and his brother got a chance when they were accepted to the inaugural class of the North American Racing Academy, the first-ever jockey school in the United States. In March 2009, Straight parlayed that training into instant success, riding to a long-shot victory at Tampa Bay Downs in his first race.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EYUPZXMTKZBX5DMBU7WXVRR5A4" data-el="text" dir="null">Then, on Aug. 26, 2009, he was riding I’m No Gentleman at Arlington Park in the Chicago suburbs when tragedy struck. Because of a brain injury, Straight can’t remember anything about the race that paralyzed him. But video shows that Straight’s horse’s front hoofs clipped the back legs of the mount in front of them. The two crashed to the track heads-first.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PO2WCH2HTJG3PEBXLJJQBCV7ZQ" data-el="text" dir="null">The accident broke the horse’s neck, forcing authorities to euthanize it. For Straight, the fall caused bleeding on the brain and broke two vertebrae in his upper spine, paralyzing him from the chest down.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MY5LZDAOOJELRM2SA5X6IZJVHA" data-el="text" dir="null">Recovery was slow. He says he remembers nothing about the weeks after his accident. But he spent seven weeks in the hospital, which included multiple surgeries. During inpatient rehabilitation, staff had him recite the alphabet and count out numbers to test the severity of his brain injury. They prodded him to build letters into words and words into sentences.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="U5BO6SFUNNB73ITF3OQRU57COU" data-el="text" dir="null">At one point, they strapped him to a bed and lifted it so that Straight was in a vertical position.

He asked the first doctor he met at rehab about the chances of walking again. The doctor told him he would be honest with him: 2 percent. As the doctor left, Straight turned to his mom and dad and said, “Two?” Then he turned toward the departing doctor’s back and held up his middle fingers.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WIXJDWWZMRG3RDP7LZQOUUANUU" data-el="text" dir="null">“I’ll show him 2 percent,” he remembered saying.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XBZULZ75NJCLZCJUDOF2RCHQWY" data-el="text" dir="null">Straight had settled into paralyzed life by 2012 when he was watching a TV show in which a character used a suit to stand and walk. At first, Straight dismissed it as the fictional embellishment of TV writers. But when he followed up with some research, he discovered there were organizations in the nascent stages. One of them was the University of Miami’s Project to Cure Paralysis, which was working with ReWalk Robotics’s exoskeleton.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MAHOZNT55FA2TL7IRGBM2SSP2M" data-el="text" dir="null">Straight was instantly sold.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UYSOITNZMZC6TKUGE3FV3B5PUI" data-el="text" dir="null">“I wanted it so bad,” he said.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AXTGYBUTEFADJPHXNDLG6EOL4Y" data-el="text" dir="null">The horse-racing community helped raise the money for the exoskeleton and, in 2014, he moved from Kentucky to South Florida so he could work with the Miami Project to Cure Paralysis. That summer, he was strapped into the exoskeleton for the first time and took his first post-paralysis steps. He was hooked.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JXK47IB57FDBNBPACSMCM4LGGE" data-el="text" dir="null">But it was one small step in what turned out to be a marathon. Straight spent the next several months working through a checklist of actions he needed to get clearance to use the device at home. They included tests of balance and strength, tasks he repeatedly failed, leading him to get stronger and more skilled.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="36TXYBONTBCJXB3EEH44VWAHSY" data-el="text" dir="null">Finally, in November 2015, he took his exoskeleton home.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FOMQABJMLNCEHPQAJ4OULDV6IA" data-el="text" dir="null">For nearly a decade, he has used the exoskeleton two to three times a week, doing about a 1,000 steps per session. Over that time, he has logged more than a half-million steps. Walking in the exoskeleton has provided him with workouts and physical therapy. It helps regulate his bowel and bladder functions and stops his legs from spasming, a common ailment of paraplegics.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4VT4Y2A4UFGWJK3SSXGKF5QQNI" data-el="text" dir="null">“It’s been a game changer,” he said.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WNXCT2BY7BCLNIIT3UOGSHIMAQ" data-el="text" dir="null">Then, in June, the watch he uses to control the machine stopped working, making it useless.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="C66LIFTOTVEX7AS7O45VHRLRMY" data-el="text" dir="null">At first, Straight figured it would be an easy fix. He’d had problems with the machine before, ones that were easily solved by ReWalk through over-the-phone instructions or an in-person visit from a technician. This time, however, ReWalk’s employees said they wouldn’t fix the exoskeleton because they were no longer working on machines older than five years.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AWXMICXHCRFTHD747LCWT2LWZY" data-el="text" dir="null">Straight resorted to Plan B — fixing it himself. But, he told his contact at ReWalk, he just needed him to tell him where he could find the parts. The contact told him to search the internet. Straight went online and discovered the battery he needed. But he couldn’t find the piece that connected the battery to the watch.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DZQSWZYM6RGU3MC3LYAWMEHNM4" data-el="text" dir="null">Straight said he called ReWalk five times in total and left messages four of those times.

Patients no longer have to foot the entire bill like they did when Straight got his machine, he noted. Earlier this year, Medicare said it would start paying for 80 percent of exoskeletons, which at Lifeward cost about $100,000.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FTGHN6HYAZDX3NC4BX77QZMQOI" data-el="text" dir="null">And although that coverage doesn’t extend to paraplegics who have injuries to their spine as high up as Straight, Jasinski said that, given his track record of walking in the exoskeleton, he’s confident Medicare would approve Lifeward’s claim.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FI4E3KMLDRAHDO37WUSMYGGXKA" data-el="text" dir="null">“We would take that battle forward,” Jasinski said.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2WPZKMWTYNDQPIUPLXDULRCCEY" data-el="text" dir="null">Straight said that his recent experience has left him wary of Lifeward and more prone to look to another company if he decides to buy another device.

<p>A fivefold increase in remote work since the pandemic could boost economic growth and bring wider benefits</p>

<!-- END INTRO TEXT --><p>Economics is famous for being the dismal science. Sadly, <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~chadj/IdeaPF.pdf">recent work</a> highlighting the slowdown in productivity growth stretching back to the 1950s is no exception. But I take a more cheerful view because of the great productivity gains promised by the pandemic-induced jump in working from home.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Working from home (WFH) increased about tenfold following the outbreak of the pandemic and has settled in at about five times its prepandemic level (see Chart 1). This could counter slowing productivity and deliver a surge in economic growth over the next few decades. If AI yields additional output, the era of slow growth could be over.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://www.imf.org/-/media/Images/IMF/FANDD/Charts/2024/09/bloom-chart1-v3.ashx?w=950" alt="Bloom 1" data-featherlight="/-/media/Images/IMF/FANDD/Charts/2024/09/bloom-chart1-v3.ashx"></p>
<p>The decomposition of economic growth by Nobel laureate Robert Solow, one of the most famous economists of all time, guides my analysis. Solow’s <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1926047">1957 classic paper</a> highlights how growth comes from both the increase in factor inputs like labor and capital and from raw productivity growth. I hang my&nbsp;analysis on his framework by highlighting in turn how each of these factors will promote faster growth.&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Labor</h6>
<p>The easiest way to see labor’s impact is the survey evidence from across the United States, Europe, and Asia that shows hybrid work is worth about an <a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.37.4.23">8 percent increase in salary</a>. Hybrid work is the typical pattern for office workers, managers, and other professionals, involving usually two or three days a week away from the office. To understand why employees would consider this to be worth 8 percent of their salary, note that typical workers spend about 45 hours a week in the office, yet they spend close to another 8 hours a week commuting. So working from home three days a week saves them about five hours a week, about 10 percent of their total weekly work and commute time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most people really dislike commuting, and so place even greater value on this time savings. See, for example, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1103572">another famous paper</a>, by the Nobel Prize winner <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2009/09/people.htm">Daniel Kahneman</a>. This research found that commuting is the most detested activity in the day, disliked even more than work itself. This makes it easy to understand why the average employee values working from home so much—with its ability to save hours of painful weekly commuting, alongside the flexibility of being able to live farther from work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This value of working from home has a powerful impact on labor supply. In the global economy there are tens of millions of people who are on the edge of the workforce. So small changes in the attractiveness of work can bring many millions of them into employment. This marginal labor force includes those with childcare or eldercare responsibilities, those close to retirement, and some folks in rural areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>One example of this WFH impact on labor supply is the <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNU02074597">approximately 2 million more employees</a> with a disability who are working in the US following the pandemic. These increases in disability employment have occurred primarily in high-WFH occupations. Employees with a disability benefit in two ways: first, by avoiding long commutes and second, by the ability to control their work environment at home.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another example is prime-age female employment in the US, which has risen about 2 percent faster than prime-age male employment since the pandemic. Women’s larger role in childcare could be driving this rise in female labor force participation via WFH, according to <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z1J2GHZjqkWzRV5ygA02yzSemwkAmzne/view">recent research</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Collectively these effects could increase labor supply by several percent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, this calculation takes the current population as given. In the longer run, WFH could also increase fertility rates. One story I’ve heard repeatedly from talking to hundreds of employees and managers is how working remotely makes it easier to parent. This is perhaps most salient in East Asia, where long workdays, punishing commutes, and intense parenting pressures have led to rapidly dropping fertility. If parents are able to work two or three days a week at home, particularly with flexible schedules that allow them to share parenting responsibilities, this could increase birth rates. <a href="http://www.wfhresearch.com/">Preliminary analysis based on US survey data</a> suggests perhaps 0.3 to 0.5 more desired children per couple when both work from home one day or more a week.&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Capital</h6>
<p>The beneficial impact of WFH on capital comes from the longer-term release of office space for other uses, like residential and retail. If employees are based at home two or three days a week, society needs less office space, and that space can be used for other activities. It also reduces commuting traffic, curbing the need for additional transportation infrastructure. More intensive use of our home capital—the space and equipment in our houses and apartments—can allow society to save on the use of transportation and office capital, which can be redeployed to other uses. In major city centers about half of the land is covered in office space, and given that office occupancy is now 50 percent below prepandemic levels, there is great potential for office space reduction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://nbloom.people.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj24291/files/media/file/supercommuters_final.pdf">Recent data on driving speeds</a> show that traffic is now moving about 2 or 3 miles per hour faster during the morning commute, which reduces the need for additional transportation infrastructure and saves the typical commuter a few minutes a day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the longer term, allowing employees to work partially or fully remotely also opens up currently underused land for housing, effectively <a href="https://www.kansascityfed.org/research/economic-review/hybrid-working-commuting-time-and-the-coming-long-term-boom-in-home-construction/">increasing the usable land supply</a>. Many major cities are heavily congested because most employees do not want to live more than a one-hour commute from the center. If they are required at work only a couple of days a week, longer commutes become possible, opening up space farther outside city centers for housing use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Collectively, these capital contributions could also raise output a few percent over the coming decades.&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Productivity</h6>
<p>Classic firm and individual micro studies <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07500-2">typically find</a> that hybrid work, the usual pattern for about 30 percent of the US, European, and Asian labor forces, has a roughly flat impact on productivity. WFH benefits workers by saving them from exhausting commutes and typically provides a quieter working environment. But by reducing time at the office, it can also reduce employees’ ability to learn, to innovate, and to communicate. These positive and negative effects roughly offset each other, generating no net productivity impact of hybrid WFH, research suggests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The impact of <a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.37.4.23">fully remote working</a>, which has been adopted by about 10 percent of employees, is highly dependent on how well it’s managed. Some studies that examined fully remote working during the early days of the pandemic found large negative impacts, potentially because of the chaos of the early lockdowns. Other studies found large positive impacts, typically in more self-directed activities, such as call center or data entry work with well-managed firms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In summary, the impact of fully remote work is perhaps neutral, because firms tend to adopt it only when such work arrangements match the work activity—often tasks such as coding or IT support, carried out by trained employees in a managed environment. But while the micro productivity impacts on any individual firm may be neutral, the huge power of labor market inclusion means that the aggregate macro impact is likely to be positive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>To explain the benefits of labor market inclusion, consider that fully in-person jobs can be filled only by nearby employees. A human resources or information technology position in New York can, for example, be filled only by a local resident. Even if there are people in Bulgaria, Brazil, or Belize who would be a better fit, they cannot do the job if they are not there in person. But as soon as positions can be filled remotely, employers go from taking the best local employee to taking the best regional employee for hybrid and the best global employee for fully remote work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~chadj/HHJK.pdf">Recent studies</a> of work discrimination and reallocation highlight how expanding labor markets to a wider pool of potential employees can have massive productivity benefits. Going from 10 to 10,000 qualified candidates for a position allows a far more productive match, particularly if AI can help screen applicants. Remote work enables global matching between employees and firms, boosting labor productivity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An additional macro productivity benefit from working from home is its positive impact on pollution from transportation. The WFH surge has curbed commuting traffic volumes across the US and Europe by an estimated 10 percent. This has <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2304099120">reduced pollution</a>, particularly emissions of low-level heavy particulates. Health studies have linked pollution to cognitive and productivity damage. Lowering pollution not only improves our quality of life but can also increase growth.&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Positive feedback loop</h6>
<p>A positive feedback loop—from working from home to faster growth and back—boosts these impacts. A long history of market-size effects in economics highlights how firms strive to innovate to serve larger, more lucrative markets. When you go from 5 million to 50 million people working from home every day, major hardware and software companies, start-ups, and funders take notice. This leads to an acceleration of new technologies to serve those markets, improving their productivity and growth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>That feedback loop has already begun. The share of <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ydRlxKc1ss17WuvlJSqXDj2vd1F12KeW/view">new patent applications</a> at the US Patent and Trademark Office that repeatedly use “remote work,” “working from home,” or similar words was flat until 2020 but has started to rise (see Chart 2). This highlights the improvement in technologies. Better cameras, screens, and software and technologies such as augmented and virtual reality and holograms will increase the productivity of hybrid and remote work in the future. This will generate a positive feedback loop between growth and working from home.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://www.imf.org/-/media/Images/IMF/FANDD/Charts/2024/09/bloom-chart2-v3.ashx?w=950" alt="Bloom 2" data-featherlight="/-/media/Images/IMF/FANDD/Charts/2024/09/bloom-chart2-v3.ashx"></p>
<p>One critique of the boom in working from home is the damage to city centers. It’s true that retail spending has fallen in city centers, but this activity has relocated to the suburbs, and overall consumption expenditure has resumed its prepandemic trend. Perhaps more problematic is the large reduction in valuations of commercial office space. Although this represents a loss of valuation for investors in the office sector, the release of city center space for residential use will in the long run make downtown living more affordable. The cost of living in the city rose dramatically in the 1990s and 2000s, pricing many middle- and lower-income employees out of city centers. This is especially problematic as many of these workers provide essential services, such as firefighting, policing, teaching, health care, food, transportation, and other work that can only be done in person. Cutting the amount of space for office use in city centers and converting it to residential use would make housing more affordable for these essential workers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 2020 surge in working from home has helped offset the prepandemic productivity slowdown overall and is boosting present and future growth. Being an economist usually means balancing winners and losers. Analyzing changes in technology, trade, prices, and regulations usually has mixed effects, with large groups of winners and losers. When it comes to working from home, the winners massively outweigh the losers. Firms, employees, and society in general have all reaped huge benefits. In my lifetime as an economist I have never seen a change that is so broadly beneficial.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This leaves me in the unusual place of being an optimistic “dismal scientist.” But it’s a place I’m happy to be as I write this while working from home. </p>

                                Working from home was not an option for most people before March 11, 2020, when work and home life suddenly collided. Stanford University's Nicholas Bloom was studying the potential impact of remote work long before the pandemic launched it into the mainstream and now has data to suggest businesses should stick to the hybrid working model.

            <h4>How AI Could Transform the World for the Better</h4>

            
            <p>I think and talk a lot about the risks of powerful AI. The company I’m the CEO of, Anthropic, does a lot
                of research on how to reduce these risks. Because of this, people sometimes draw the conclusion that I’m
                a pessimist or “doomer” who thinks AI will be mostly bad or dangerous. I don’t think that at all. In
                fact, one of my main reasons for focusing on risks is that they’re the only thing standing between us
                and what I see as a fundamentally positive future. <strong>I think that most people are underestimating
                    just how radical the upside of AI could be</strong>, just as I think most people are underestimating
                how bad the risks could be.</p>
            <p>In this essay I try to sketch out what that upside might look like—what a world with powerful AI might
                look like if everything goes <i>right</i>. Of course no one can know the future with any certainty or
                precision, and the effects of powerful AI are likely to be even more unpredictable than past
                technological changes, so all of this is unavoidably going to consist of guesses. But I am aiming for at
                least educated and useful guesses, which capture the flavor of what will happen even if most details end
                up being wrong. I’m including lots of details mainly because I think a concrete vision does more to
                advance discussion than a highly hedged and abstract one.</p>
            <p>First, however, I wanted to briefly explain why I and Anthropic haven’t talked that much about powerful
                AI’s upsides, and why we’ll probably continue, overall, to talk a lot about risks. In particular, I’ve
                made this choice out of a desire to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Maximize leverage</strong>. The basic development of AI technology and many (not all) of its
                    benefits seems inevitable (unless the risks derail everything) and is fundamentally driven by
                    powerful market forces. On the other hand, the risks are not predetermined and our actions can
                    greatly change their likelihood.</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid perception of propaganda</strong>. AI companies talking about all the amazing benefits
                    of AI can come off like propagandists, or as if they’re attempting to distract from downsides. I
                    also think that as a matter of principle it’s bad for your soul to spend too much of your time
                    “talking your book”.</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid grandiosity</strong>. I am often turned off by the way many AI risk public figures
                    (not to mention AI company leaders) talk about the post-AGI world, as if it’s their mission to
                    single-handedly bring it about like a prophet leading their people to salvation. I think it’s
                    dangerous to view companies as unilaterally shaping the world, and dangerous to view practical
                    technological goals in essentially religious terms.</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid “sci-fi” baggage</strong>. Although I think most people underestimate the upside of
                    powerful AI, the small community of people who do discuss radical AI futures often does so in an
                    excessively “sci-fi” tone (featuring e.g. uploaded minds, space exploration, or general cyberpunk
                    vibes). I think this causes people to take the claims less seriously, and to imbue them with a sort
                    of unreality. To be clear, the issue isn’t whether the technologies described are possible or likely
                    (the main essay discusses this in granular detail)—it’s more that the “vibe” connotatively smuggles
                    in a bunch of cultural baggage and unstated assumptions about what kind of future is desirable, how
                    various societal issues will play out, etc. The result often ends up reading like a fantasy for a
                    narrow subculture, while being off-putting to most people.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Yet despite all of the concerns above, I really do think it’s important to discuss what a good world with
                powerful AI could look like, while doing our best to avoid the above pitfalls. In fact I think it is
                critical to have a genuinely inspiring vision of the future, and not <i>just</i> a plan to fight fires.
                Many of the implications of powerful AI are adversarial or dangerous, but at the end of it all, there
                has to be something we’re fighting <i>for</i>, some positive-sum outcome where everyone is better off,
                something to rally people to rise above their squabbles and confront the challenges ahead. Fear is one
                kind of motivator, but it’s not enough: we need hope as well.</p>
            <p>The list of positive applications of powerful AI is extremely long (and includes robotics, manufacturing,
                energy, and much more), but I’m going to focus on a small number of areas that seem to me to have the
                greatest potential to directly improve the quality of human life. The five categories I am most excited
                about are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Biology and physical health</li>
                <li>Neuroscience and mental health</li>
                <li>Economic development and poverty</li>
                <li>Peace and governance</li>
                <li>Work and meaning</li>
            </ol>
            <p>My predictions are going to be radical as judged by most standards (other than sci-fi “singularity”
                visions<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>), but I mean them earnestly
                and sincerely. Everything I’m saying could very easily be wrong (to repeat my point from above), but
                I’ve at least attempted to ground my views in a semi-analytical assessment of how much progress in
                various fields might speed up and what that might mean in practice. I am fortunate to have professional
                experience in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6-e-ZBEAAAAJ" target="_blank">both
                    biology and neuroscience</a>, and I am an informed amateur in the field of economic development, but
                I am sure I will get plenty of things wrong. One thing writing this essay has made me realize is that it
                would be valuable to bring together a group of domain experts (in biology, economics, international
                relations, and other areas) to write a much better and more informed version of what I’ve produced here.
                It’s probably best to view my efforts here as a starting prompt for that group.</p>
            <h2>Basic assumptions and framework</h2>
            <p>To make this whole essay more precise and grounded, it’s helpful to specify clearly what we mean by
                powerful AI (i.e. the threshold at which the 5-10 year clock starts counting), as well as laying out a
                framework for thinking about the effects of such AI once it’s present.</p>
            <p>What powerful AI (I dislike the term AGI)<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> will look like, and when (or if) it will arrive, is a huge topic in
                itself. It’s one I’ve discussed publicly and could write a completely separate essay on (I probably will
                at some point). Obviously, many people are skeptical that powerful AI will be built soon and some are
                skeptical that it will ever be built at all. I think it could come as early as 2026, though there are
                also ways it could take much longer. But for the purposes of this essay, I’d like to put these issues
                aside, assume it will come reasonably soon, and focus on what happens in the 5-10 years after that. I
                also want to assume a definition of what such a system <i>will look like,</i> what its capabilities are
                and how it interacts, even though there is room for disagreement on this.</p>
            <p>By <i>powerful AI</i>, I have in mind an AI model—likely similar to today’s LLM’s in form, though it
                might be based on a different architecture, might involve several interacting models, and might be
                trained differently—with the following properties:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In terms of pure intelligence<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>, it
                    is smarter than a Nobel Prize winner across most relevant fields –
                    biology, programming, math, engineering, writing, etc. This means it can prove unsolved mathematical
                    theorems, write extremely good novels, write difficult codebases from scratch, etc.</li>
                <li>In addition to just being a “smart thing you talk to”, it has all the “interfaces” available to a
                    human working virtually, including text, audio, video, mouse and keyboard control, and internet
                    access. It can engage in any actions, communications, or remote operations enabled by this
                    interface, including taking actions on the internet, taking or giving directions to humans, ordering
                    materials, directing experiments, watching videos, making videos, and so on. It does all of these
                    tasks with, again, a skill exceeding that of the most capable humans in the world.</li>
                <li>It does not just passively answer questions; instead, it can be given tasks that take hours, days,
                    or weeks to complete, and then goes off and does those tasks autonomously, in the way a smart
                    employee would, asking for clarification as necessary.</li>
                <li>It does not have a physical embodiment (other than living on a computer screen), but it can control
                    existing physical tools, robots, or laboratory equipment through a computer; in theory it could even
                    design robots or equipment for itself to use.</li>
                <li>The resources used to train the model can be repurposed to <i>run</i> millions of instances of it
                    (this matches projected cluster sizes by ~2027), and the model can absorb information and generate
                    actions at roughly 10x-100x human speed<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>. It may however be limited by the response time of the physical
                    world or of software it interacts with.</li>
                <li>Each of these million copies can act independently on unrelated tasks, or if needed can all work
                    together in the same way humans would collaborate, perhaps with different subpopulations fine-tuned
                    to be especially good at particular tasks.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We could summarize this as a “country of geniuses in a datacenter”.</p>
            <p>Clearly such an entity would be capable of solving very difficult problems, very fast, but it is not
                trivial to figure out how fast. Two “extreme” positions both seem false to me. First, you might think
                that the world would be instantly transformed on the scale of seconds or days (“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity#:~:text=The%20technological%20singularity%E2%80%94or%20simply,unforeseeable%20consequences%20for%20Human%20civilization." target="_blank">the Singularity</a>”), as superior intelligence builds on itself and solves every
                possible scientific, engineering, and operational task almost immediately. The problem with this is that
                there are real physical and practical limits, for example around building hardware or conducting
                biological experiments. Even a new country of geniuses would hit up against these limits. Intelligence
                may be very powerful, but it isn’t magic fairy dust.</p>
            <p>Second, and conversely, you might believe that technological progress is saturated or rate-limited by
                real world data or by social factors, and that better-than-human intelligence will add very little<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup>. This seems equally implausible to
                me—I can think of hundreds of scientific or even social problems where a large group of really smart
                people would drastically speed up progress, especially if they aren’t limited to analysis and can make
                things happen in the real world (which our postulated country of geniuses can, including by directing or
                assisting teams of humans).</p>
            <p>I think the truth is likely to be some messy admixture of these two extreme pictures, something that
                varies by task and field and is very subtle in its details. I believe we need new frameworks to think
                about these details in a productive way.</p>
            <p>Economists often talk about “factors of production”: things like labor, land, and capital. The phrase
                “marginal returns to labor/land/capital” captures the idea that in a given situation, a given factor may
                or may not be the limiting one – for example, an air force needs both planes and pilots, and hiring more
                pilots doesn’t help much if you’re out of planes. I believe that in the AI age, we should be talking
                about <i>the marginal returns to intelligence<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7">7</a></sup></i>, and trying to figure out what the other factors are that are
                complementary to intelligence and that become limiting factors when intelligence is very high. We are
                not used to thinking in this way—to asking “how much does being smarter help with this task, and on what
                timescale?”—but it seems like the right way to conceptualize a world with very powerful AI.</p>
            <p>My guess at a list of factors that limit or are complementary to intelligence includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Speed of the outside world</strong>. Intelligent agents need to operate interactively in the
                    world in order to accomplish things and also to learn<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8">8</a></sup>. But the world only moves so fast. Cells and animals run at a fixed
                    speed so experiments on them take a certain amount of time which may be irreducible. The same is
                    true of hardware, materials science, anything involving communicating with people, and even our
                    existing software infrastructure. Furthermore, in science many experiments are often needed in
                    sequence, each learning from or building on the last. All of this means that the speed at which a
                    major project—for example developing a cancer cure—can be completed may have an irreducible minimum
                    that cannot be decreased further even as intelligence continues to increase.</li>
                <li><strong>Need for data</strong>. Sometimes raw data is lacking and in its absence more intelligence
                    does not help. Today’s particle physicists are very ingenious and have developed a wide range of
                    theories, but lack the data to choose between them because particle accelerator data <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/02/20/1088002/higgs-boson-physics-particle-collider-large-hadron-collider/" target="_blank">is so limited</a>. It is not clear that they would do drastically better if they
                    were superintelligent—other than perhaps by speeding up the construction of a bigger accelerator.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Intrinsic complexity</strong>. Some things are inherently unpredictable or chaotic and even
                    the most powerful AI cannot predict or untangle them substantially better than a human or a computer
                    today. For example, even incredibly powerful AI could predict only marginally further ahead in a
                    chaotic system (such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-body_problem" target="_blank">three-body problem</a>) in the general case,<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9">9</a></sup> as compared to today’s humans and computers.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Constraints from humans</strong>. Many things cannot be done without breaking laws, harming
                    humans, or messing up society. An aligned AI would not want to do these things (and if we have an
                    unaligned AI, we’re back to talking about risks). Many human societal structures are inefficient or
                    even actively harmful, but are hard to change while respecting constraints like legal requirements
                    on clinical trials, people’s willingness to change their habits, or the behavior of governments.
                    Examples of advances that work well in a technical sense, but whose impact has been substantially
                    reduced by regulations or misplaced fears, include nuclear power, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concorde" target="_blank">supersonic flight</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/08/opinion/elevator-construction-regulation-labor-immigration.html" target="_blank">even elevators</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Physical laws</strong>. This is a starker version of the first point. There are certain
                    physical laws that appear to be unbreakable. It’s not possible to travel faster than light. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcadia_(play)" target="_blank">Pudding does not unstir</a>.
                    Chips can only have so many transistors per square centimeter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_tunnelling" target="_blank">before they become
                        unreliable</a>. Computation requires a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landauer%27s_principle" target="_blank">certain minimum
                        energy per bit</a> erased, limiting the density of computation in the world.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>There is a further distinction based on <i>timescales</i>. Things that are hard constraints in the short
                run may become more malleable to intelligence in the long run. For example, intelligence might be used
                to develop a new experimental paradigm that allows us to learn <i>in vitro</i> what used to require live
                animal experiments, or to build the tools needed to collect new data (e.g. the bigger particle
                accelerator), or to (within ethical limits) find ways around human-based constraints (e.g. helping to
                improve the clinical trial system, helping to create new jurisdictions where clinical trials have less
                bureaucracy, or improving the science itself to make human clinical trials less necessary or cheaper).
            </p>
            <p>Thus, we should imagine a picture where intelligence is initially heavily bottlenecked by the other
                factors of production, but over time intelligence itself increasingly routes around the other factors,
                even if they never fully dissolve (and some things like physical laws are absolute)<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10">10</a></sup>. The key question is how fast it all happens and
                in what order.</p>
            <p>With the above framework in mind, I’ll try to answer that question for the five areas mentioned in the
                introduction.</p>
            <h2>1. Biology and health</h2>
            <p>Biology is probably the area where scientific progress has the greatest potential to directly and
                unambiguously improve the quality of human life. In the last century some of the most ancient human
                afflictions (such as smallpox) have finally been vanquished, but many more still remain, and defeating
                them would be an enormous humanitarian accomplishment. Beyond even curing disease, biological science
                can in principle improve the <i>baseline</i> quality of human health, by extending the healthy human
                lifespan, increasing control and freedom over our own biological processes, and addressing everyday
                problems that we currently think of as immutable parts of the human condition.</p>
            <p>In the “limiting factors” language of the previous section, the main challenges with directly applying
                intelligence to biology are data, the speed of the physical world, and intrinsic complexity (in fact,
                all three are related to each other). Human constraints also play a role at a later stage, when clinical
                trials are involved. Let’s take these one by one.</p>
            <p>Experiments on cells, animals, and even chemical processes are limited by the speed of the physical
                world: many biological protocols involve culturing bacteria or other cells, or simply waiting for
                chemical reactions to occur, and this can sometimes take days or even weeks, with no obvious way to
                speed it up. Animal experiments can take months (or more) and human experiments often take years (or
                even decades for long-term outcome studies). Somewhat related to this, data is often lacking—not so much
                in quantity, but quality: there is always a dearth of clear, unambiguous data that isolates a biological
                effect of interest from the other 10,000 confounding things that are going on, or that intervenes
                causally in a given process, or that directly measures some effect (as opposed to inferring its
                consequences in some indirect or noisy way). Even massive, quantitative molecular data, like the
                proteomics data that I collected while working on mass spectrometry techniques, is noisy and misses a
                lot (which types of cells were these proteins in? Which part of the cell? At what phase in the cell
                cycle?).</p>
            <p>In part responsible for these problems with data is intrinsic complexity: if you’ve ever seen a <a href="https://today.ucsd.edu/story/international_consortium_builds_google_map_of_human_metabolism" target="_blank">diagram showing the biochemistry of human metabolism</a>, you’ll know that it’s very
                hard to isolate the effect of any part of this complex system, and even harder to intervene on the
                system in a precise or predictable way. And finally, beyond just the intrinsic time that it takes to run
                an experiment on humans, actual clinical trials involve a lot of bureaucracy and regulatory requirements
                that (in the opinion of many people, including me) add unnecessary additional time and delay progress.
            </p>
            <p>Given all this, many biologists have long been <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00306-2" target="_blank">skeptical</a> of the value
                of AI and “big data” more generally in biology. Historically, mathematicians, computer scientists, and
                physicists who have applied their skills to biology over the last 30 years have been quite successful,
                but have not had the truly transformative impact initially hoped for. Some of the skepticism has been
                reduced by major and revolutionary breakthroughs like <a href="https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/" target="_blank">AlphaFold</a> (which has just deservedly won its creators the <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2024/summary/" target="_blank">Nobel Prize in
                    Chemistry</a>) and <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphaproteo-generates-novel-proteins-for-biology-and-health-research/" target="_blank">AlphaProteo</a><sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11">11</a></sup>, but there’s still a perception that AI is (and will continue to be)
                useful in only a limited set of circumstances. A common formulation is “AI can do a better job analyzing
                your data, but it can’t produce more data or improve the quality of the data. Garbage in, garbage out”.
            </p>
            <p>But I think that pessimistic perspective is thinking about AI in the wrong way. If our core hypothesis
                about AI progress is correct, then the right way to think of AI is not as a method of data analysis, but
                as a virtual biologist who performs <i>all</i> the tasks biologists do, including designing and running
                experiments in the real world (by controlling lab robots or simply telling humans which experiments to
                run – as a Principal Investigator would to their graduate students), inventing new biological methods or
                measurement
                techniques, and so on. It is by speeding up <i>the whole research process</i> that AI can truly
                accelerate biology. <strong>I want to repeat this because it’s the most common misconception that comes
                    up when I talk about AI’s ability to transform biology: I am <i>not</i> talking about AI as merely a
                    tool to analyze data. In line with the definition of powerful AI at the beginning of this essay, I’m
                    talking about using AI to perform, direct, and improve upon nearly everything biologists
                    do.</strong></p>
            <p>To get more specific on where I think acceleration is likely to come from, a surprisingly large fraction
                of the progress in biology has come from a truly tiny number of discoveries, often related to broad
                measurement tools or techniques<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12">12</a></sup>
                that allow precise but generalized or programmable intervention in biological systems. There’s perhaps
                ~1 of these major discoveries per year and collectively they arguably drive &gt;50% of progress in biology.
                These discoveries are so powerful precisely because they cut through intrinsic complexity and data
                limitations, directly increasing our understanding and control over biological processes. A few
                discoveries per decade have enabled both the bulk of our basic scientific understanding of biology, and
                have driven many of the most powerful medical treatments.</p>
            <p>Some examples include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR" target="_blank">CRISPR</a>: a technique that allows
                    live editing of any gene in living organisms (replacement of any arbitrary gene sequence with any
                    other arbitrary sequence). Since the original technique was developed, there have been <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41581-022-00636-2" target="_blank">constant
                        improvements</a> to target specific cell types, increasing accuracy, and reducing edits of the
                    wrong gene—all of which are needed for safe use in humans.</li>
                <li>Various kinds of microscopy for watching what is going on at a precise level: advanced light
                    microscopes (with various kinds of fluorescent techniques, special optics, etc), electron
                    microscopes, atomic force microscopes, etc.</li>
                <li>Genome sequencing and synthesis, which has <a href="https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/Sequencing-Human-Genome-cost" target="_blank">dropped in cost</a> by several orders of magnitude in the last couple decades.
                </li>
                <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optogenetics#:~:text=Optogenetics%20is%20a%20biological%20technique,specifically%20in%20the%20target%20cells." target="_blank">Optogenetic</a> techniques that allow you to get a neuron to fire by shining a
                    light on it.</li>
                <li><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34433919/" target="_blank">mRNA vaccines</a> that, in
                    principle, allow us to design a vaccine against anything and then quickly adapt it (mRNA vaccines of
                    course became famous during COVID).</li>
                <li>Cell therapies such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAR_T_cell" target="_blank">CAR-T</a>
                    that allow immune cells to be taken out of the body and “reprogrammed” to attack, in principle,
                    anything.</li>
                <li>Conceptual insights like the germ theory of disease or the realization of a link between the immune
                    system and cancer<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13">13</a></sup>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I’m going to the trouble of listing all these technologies because I want to make a crucial claim about
                them: <strong>I think their rate of discovery could be increased by 10x or more if there were a lot more
                    talented, creative researchers</strong><i>.</i> Or, put another way, <strong>I think the returns to
                    intelligence are high for these discoveries</strong>, and that everything else in biology and
                medicine mostly follows from them.</p>
            <p>Why do I think this? Because of the answers to some questions that we should get in the habit of asking
                when we’re trying to determine “returns to intelligence”. First, these discoveries are generally made by
                a tiny number of researchers, often the same people repeatedly, suggesting skill and not random search
                (the latter might suggest lengthy experiments are the limiting factor). Second, they often “could have
                been made” years earlier than they were: for example, CRISPR was a naturally occurring component of the
                immune system in bacteria that’s been <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1062360422040075" target="_blank">known since the
                    80’s</a>, but it took another 25 years for people to realize it could be repurposed for general gene
                editing. They also are often delayed many years by lack of support from the scientific community for
                promising directions (see <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/10/5/23903292/katalin-kariko-drew-weissman-nobel-prize-medicine-mrna-vaccines-covid-coronavirus" target="_blank">this profile</a> on the inventor of mRNA vaccines; similar stories abound). Third,
                successful projects are often scrappy or were afterthoughts that people didn’t initially think were
                promising, rather than massively funded efforts. This suggests that it’s not just massive resource
                concentration that drives discoveries, but ingenuity.</p>
            <p>Finally, although some of these discoveries have “serial dependence” (you need to make discovery A first
                in order to have the tools or knowledge to make discovery B)—which again might create experimental
                delays—many, perhaps most, are independent, meaning many at once can be worked on in parallel. Both
                these facts, and my general experience as a biologist, strongly suggest to me that there are hundreds of
                these discoveries waiting to be made if scientists were smarter and better at making connections between
                the vast amount of biological knowledge humanity possesses (again consider the CRISPR example). The
                success of <a href="https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/" target="_blank">AlphaFold</a>/<a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphaproteo-generates-novel-proteins-for-biology-and-health-research/" target="_blank">AlphaProteo</a> at solving important problems much more effectively than humans,
                despite decades of carefully designed physics modeling, provides a proof of principle (albeit with a
                narrow tool in a narrow domain) that should point the way forward.</p>
            <p>Thus, it’s my guess that powerful AI could at least 10x the rate of these discoveries, giving us the next
                50-100 years of biological progress in 5-10 years.<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14">14</a></sup> Why not 100x? Perhaps it is possible, but here both serial dependence
                and experiment times become important: getting 100 years of progress in 1 year requires a lot of things
                to go right the first time, including animal experiments and things like designing microscopes or
                expensive lab facilities. I’m actually open to the (perhaps absurd-sounding) idea that we could get
                <i>1000</i> years of progress in 5-10 years, but very skeptical that we can get 100 years in 1 year.
                Another way to put it is I think there’s an unavoidable constant delay: experiments and hardware design
                have a certain “latency” and need to be iterated upon a certain “irreducible” number of times in order
                to learn things that can’t be deduced logically. But massive parallelism may be possible on top of
                that<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15">15</a></sup>.
            </p>
            <p>What about clinical trials? Although there is a lot of bureaucracy and slowdown associated with them, the
                truth is that a lot (though by no means all!) of their slowness ultimately derives from the need to
                rigorously evaluate drugs that barely work or ambiguously work. This is sadly true of most therapies
                today: the average cancer drug increases survival by a few months while having significant side effects
                that need to be carefully measured (there’s a similar story for Alzheimer’s drugs). This leads to huge
                studies (in order to achieve statistical power) and difficult tradeoffs which regulatory agencies
                generally aren’t great at making, again because of bureaucracy and the complexity of competing
                interests.</p>
            <p>When something works really well, it goes much faster: there’s an accelerated approval track and the ease
                of approval is much greater when effect sizes are larger. mRNA vaccines for COVID were approved in 9
                months—much faster than the usual pace. That said, even under these conditions clinical trials are still
                too slow—mRNA vaccines arguably <a href="https://www.1daysooner.org/" target="_blank"><i>should</i> have
                    been approved in ~2 months</a>. But these kinds of delays (~1 year end-to-end for a drug) combined
                with massive parallelization and the need for some but not too much iteration (“a few tries”) are very
                compatible with radical transformation in 5-10 years. Even more optimistically, it is possible that <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S135964462400134X" target="_blank">AI-enabled biological science</a> will reduce the need for iteration in clinical
                trials by developing better animal and cell experimental models (or even simulations) that are more
                accurate in predicting what will happen in humans. This will be particularly important in developing
                drugs against the aging process, which plays out over decades and where we need a faster iteration loop.
            </p>
            <p>Finally, on the topic of clinical trials and societal barriers, it is worth pointing out explicitly that
                in some ways biomedical innovations have an unusually <i>strong</i> track record of being successfully
                deployed, in contrast to some other technologies<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16">16</a></sup>. As mentioned in the introduction, many technologies are hampered by
                societal factors despite working well technically. This might suggest a pessimistic perspective on what
                AI can accomplish<i>.</i> But biomedicine is unique in that although the process of developing drugs is
                overly cumbersome, once developed they generally are successfully deployed and used.</p>
            <strong>To summarize the above, my basic prediction is that AI-enabled biology and medicine will allow us to
                compress the progress that human biologists would have achieved over the next 50-100 years into 5-10
                years. I’ll refer to this as the “compressed 21st century”: the idea that after powerful AI is
                developed, we will in a few years make all the progress in biology and medicine that we would have made
                in the whole 21st century.</strong>
            <p>Although predicting what powerful AI can do in a few years remains inherently difficult and
                speculative,
                there is some concreteness to asking “what could humans do unaided in the next 100 years?”. Simply
                looking at what we’ve accomplished in the 20th century, or extrapolating from the first 2 decades of
                the
                21st, or asking what “10 CRISPR’s and 50 CAR-T’s” would get us, all offer practical, grounded ways
                to
                estimate the general level of progress we might expect from powerful AI.</p>
            <p>Below I try to make a list of what we might expect. This is not based on any rigorous methodology,
                and
                will almost certainly prove wrong in the details, but it’s trying to get across the general
                <i>level</i>
                of radicalism we should expect:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reliable prevention and treatment of nearly all</strong><sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17">17</a></sup> <strong>natural infectious
                        disease.</strong>
                    Given the enormous advances against infectious disease in the 20th century, it is not radical to
                    imagine that we could more or less “finish the job” in a compressed 21st. mRNA vaccines and
                    similar
                    technology already point the way towards “<a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/clinical-trial-mrna-universal-influenza-vaccine-candidate-begins" target="_blank">vaccines for anything</a>”. Whether infectious disease is <i>fully
                        eradicated
                        from the world</i> (as opposed to just in some places) depends on questions about poverty
                    and
                    inequality, which are discussed in Section 3.</li>
                <li><strong>Elimination of most cancer</strong>. Death rates from cancer <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/384/bmj-2023-076962" target="_blank">have been dropping
                        ~2%
                        per year</a> for the last few decades; thus we are on track to eliminate most cancer in the
                    21st
                    century at the current pace of human science. Some subtypes have already been largely cured (for
                    example some types of leukemia with <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2022/02/02/cart-cancer-therapy-leukemia-treatment/" target="_blank">CAR-T therapy</a>), and I’m perhaps even more excited for very selective
                    drugs
                    that target cancer in its infancy and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10080017/" target="_blank">prevent it</a>
                    from ever growing. AI will also make possible treatment regimens very <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305737220300578" target="_blank">finely adapted</a> to the individualized genome of the cancer—these are
                    possible
                    today, but hugely expensive in time and human expertise, which AI should allow us to scale.
                    Reductions of 95% or more in both mortality and incidence seem possible. That said, cancer is
                    extremely varied and adaptive, and is likely the hardest of these diseases to fully destroy. It
                    would not be surprising if an assortment of rare, difficult malignancies persists.</li>
                <li><strong>Very effective prevention and effective cures for genetic disease</strong>. Greatly
                    improved
                    <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-01735-0" target="_blank">embryo
                        screening</a>
                    will likely make it possible to prevent most genetic disease, and some safer, more reliable
                    descendant of CRISPR may cure most genetic disease in existing people. Whole-body afflictions
                    that
                    affect a large fraction of cells may be the last holdouts, however.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Prevention of Alzheimer’s</strong>. We’ve had a very hard time figuring out what causes
                    Alzheimer’s (it is somehow related to beta-amyloid protein, but the actual details seem to be <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-021-01249-0" target="_blank">very complex</a>).
                    It
                    seems like exactly the type of problem that can be solved with better measurement tools that
                    isolate
                    biological effects; thus I am bullish about AI’s ability to solve it. There is a good chance it
                    can
                    eventually be prevented with relatively simple interventions, once we actually understand what
                    is
                    going on. That said, damage from already-existing Alzheimer’s may be very difficult to reverse.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Improved treatment of most other ailments</strong>. This is a catch-all category for
                    other
                    ailments including diabetes, obesity, heart disease, autoimmune diseases, and more. Most of
                    these
                    seem “easier” to solve than cancer and Alzheimer’s and in many cases are already in steep
                    decline.
                    For example, deaths from heart disease have already declined over 50%, and simple interventions
                    like
                    <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/edm2.462&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1726506125482285&amp;usg=AOvVaw1t12gKr6YA4RNeWMnhLtU6" target="_blank">GLP-1 agonists</a> have already made huge progress against obesity and
                    diabetes.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Biological freedom</strong>. The last 70 years featured advances in birth control,
                    fertility, <a href="https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/why-does-ozempic-cure-all-diseases" target="_blank">management of weight</a>, and much more. But I suspect AI-accelerated
                    biology
                    will greatly expand what is possible: weight, physical appearance, reproduction, and other
                    biological processes will be fully under people’s control. We’ll refer to these under the
                    heading of
                    <i>biological freedom:</i> the idea that everyone should be empowered to choose what they want
                    to
                    become and live their lives in the way that most appeals to them. There will of course be
                    important
                    questions about global equality of access; see Section 3 for these.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Doubling of the human lifespan<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18">18</a></sup>.</strong>This might seem radical,
                    but <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy" target="_blank">life expectancy increased
                        almost 2x</a> in the 20th century (from ~40 years to ~75), so it’s “on trend” that the
                    “compressed 21st” would double it again to 150. Obviously the interventions involved in slowing
                    the
                    actual aging process will be different from those that were needed in the last century to
                    prevent
                    (mostly childhood) premature deaths from disease, but the magnitude of change is not
                    unprecedented<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:18">19</a></sup>. Concretely,
                    there already <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07701-9" target="_blank">exist
                        drugs that increase maximum lifespan in rats by 25-50%</a> with limited ill-effects. And
                    some
                    animals (e.g. some types of turtle) already live 200 years, so humans are manifestly not at some
                    theoretical upper limit. At a guess, the most important thing that is needed might be reliable,
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law" target="_blank">non-Goodhart-able</a>
                    biomarkers of human aging, as that will allow fast iteration on experiments and clinical trials.
                    Once human lifespan is 150, we may be able to reach “escape velocity”, buying enough time that
                    most
                    of those currently alive today will be able to live as long as they want, although there’s
                    certainly
                    no guarantee this is biologically possible.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>It is worth looking at this list and reflecting on how different the world will be if all of it is
                achieved 7-12 years from now (which would be in line with an aggressive AI timeline). It goes
                without
                saying that it would be an unimaginable humanitarian triumph, the elimination all at once of most of
                the
                scourges that have haunted humanity for millennia. Many of my friends and colleagues are raising
                children, and when those children grow up, I hope that any mention of disease will sound to them the
                way
                scurvy, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/smallpox" target="_blank">smallpox</a>, or bubonic
                plague
                sounds to us. That generation will also benefit from increased biological freedom and
                self-expression,
                and with luck may also be able to live as long as they want.</p>
            <p>It’s hard to overestimate how surprising these changes will be to everyone except the small community
                of
                people who expected powerful AI. For example, thousands of economists and policy experts in the US
                currently debate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_debate_in_the_United_States" target="_blank">how to keep Social Security</a> and Medicare solvent, and more broadly how to
                keep
                down the cost of healthcare (which is mostly consumed by those over 70 and especially those with
                terminal illnesses such as cancer). The situation for these programs is likely to be radically
                improved
                if all this comes to pass<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20">20</a></sup>, as
                the
                ratio of working age to retired population will change drastically. No doubt these challenges will
                be
                replaced with others, such as how to ensure widespread access to the new technologies, but it is
                worth
                reflecting on how much the world will change even if biology is the <i>only</i> area to be
                successfully
                accelerated by AI.</p>
            <h2>2. Neuroscience and mind</h2>
            <p>In the previous section I focused on <i>physical</i> diseases and biology in general, and didn’t
                cover
                neuroscience or mental health. But neuroscience is a subdiscipline of biology and mental health is
                just
                as important as physical health. In fact, if anything, mental health affects human well-being even
                more
                directly than physical health. Hundreds of millions of people have very low quality of life due to
                problems like addiction, depression, schizophrenia, low-functioning autism, PTSD, psychopathy<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21">21</a></sup>, or intellectual disabilities.
                Billions more struggle with everyday problems that can often be interpreted as much milder versions
                of
                one of these severe clinical disorders. And as with general biology, it may be possible to go beyond
                addressing problems to improving the baseline quality of human experience.</p>
            <p>The basic framework that I laid out for biology applies equally to neuroscience. The field is
                propelled
                forward by a small number of discoveries often related to tools for measurement or precise
                intervention
                – in the list of those above, optogenetics was a neuroscience discovery, and more recently <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLARITY" target="_blank">CLARITY</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_microscopy#:~:text=Expansion%20microscopy%20(ExM)%20is%20a,them%20using%20a%20polymer%20system." target="_blank">expansion microscopy</a> are
                advances
                in the same vein, in addition to many of the general cell biology methods directly carrying over to
                neuroscience. I think the rate of these advances will be similarly accelerated by AI and therefore
                that
                the framework of “100 years of progress in 5-10 years” applies to neuroscience in the same way it
                does
                to biology and for the same reasons. As in biology, the progress in 20th century neuroscience was
                enormous – for example we didn’t even understand how or why neurons fired <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgkin%E2%80%93Huxley_model" target="_blank">until the
                    1950’s</a>. Thus, it seems reasonable to expect AI-accelerated neuroscience to produce rapid
                progress over a few years.</p>
            <p>There is one thing we should add to this basic picture, which is that some of the things we’ve
                learned
                (or are learning) about AI itself in the last few years are likely to help advance neuroscience,
                even if
                it continues to be done only by humans. <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/mapping-mind-language-model" target="_blank">Interpretability</a> is an obvious example: although biological neurons
                superficially operate in a completely different manner from artificial neurons (they communicate via
                spikes and often spike rates, so there is a time element not present in artificial neurons, and a
                bunch
                of details relating to cell physiology and neurotransmitters modifies their operation
                substantially),
                the basic question of “how do distributed, trained networks of simple units that perform combined
                linear/non-linear operations work together to perform important computations” is the same, and I
                strongly suspect the details of individual neuron communication will be abstracted away in most of
                the
                interesting questions about computation and circuits<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22">22</a></sup>. As just one example of this, a <a href="https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/frequency-edges/" target="_blank">computational
                    mechanism</a> discovered by interpretability researchers in AI systems was recently <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10055119/" target="_blank">rediscovered</a>
                in
                the brains of mice.</p>
            <p>It is much easier to do experiments on artificial neural networks than on real ones (the latter often
                requires cutting into animal brains), so interpretability may well become a tool for improving our
                understanding of neuroscience. Furthermore, powerful AI’s will themselves probably be able to
                develop
                and apply this tool better than humans can.</p>
            <p>Beyond just interpretability though, what we have learned from AI about how intelligent systems are
                <i>trained</i> should (though I am not sure it <i>has</i> yet) cause a revolution in neuroscience.
                When
                I was working in neuroscience, a lot of people focused on what I would now consider the wrong
                questions
                about learning, because the concept of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361" target="_blank">scaling hypothesis</a> / <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~eunsol/courses/data/bitter_lesson.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bitter lesson</a> didn’t
                exist yet. The idea that a simple objective function plus a lot of data can
                drive
                incredibly complex behaviors makes it more interesting to understand the objective functions and
                architectural biases and less interesting to understand the details of the emergent computations. I
                have
                not followed the field closely in recent years, but I have a vague sense that computational
                neuroscientists have still not fully absorbed the lesson. My attitude to the scaling hypothesis has
                always been “aha – this is an explanation, at a high level, of how intelligence works and how it so
                easily evolved”, but I don’t think that’s the average neuroscientist’s view, in part because the
                scaling
                hypothesis as “the secret to intelligence” isn’t fully accepted even within AI.
            </p>
            <p>I think that neuroscientists should be trying to combine this basic insight with the particularities
                of
                the human brain (biophysical limitations, evolutionary history, topology, details of motor and
                sensory
                inputs/outputs) to try to figure out some of neuroscience’s key puzzles. Some likely are, but I
                suspect
                it’s not enough yet, and that AI neuroscientists will be able to more effectively leverage this
                angle to
                accelerate progress.</p>
            <p>I expect AI to accelerate neuroscientific progress along four distinct routes, all of which can
                hopefully
                work together to cure mental illness and improve function:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Traditional molecular biology, chemistry, and genetics</strong>. This is essentially the
                    same story as general biology in section 1, and AI can likely speed it up via the same
                    mechanisms.
                    There are many drugs that modulate neurotransmitters in order to alter brain function, affect
                    alertness or perception, change mood, etc., and AI can <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adn1524" target="_blank">help us invent</a>
                    many more. AI can probably also accelerate research on the genetic basis of mental illness.</li>
                <li><strong>Fine-grained neural measurement and intervention</strong>. This is the ability to
                    measure
                    what a lot of individual neurons or neuronal circuits are doing, and intervene to change their
                    behavior. Optogenetics and neural probes are technologies capable of both measurement and
                    intervention in live organisms, and a number of very advanced methods (such as molecular ticker
                    tapes to read out the firing patterns of large numbers of individual neurons) <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.5709" target="_blank">have also been proposed</a> and seem
                    possible in principle.</li>
                <li><strong>Advanced computational neuroscience</strong>. As noted above, both the specific insights
                    and
                    the <i>gestalt</i> of modern AI can probably be applied fruitfully to questions in <a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(23)00099-2" target="_blank">systems neuroscience</a>, including perhaps uncovering the real
                    causes
                    and dynamics of complex diseases like psychosis or mood disorders.</li>
                <li><strong>Behavioral interventions</strong>. I haven’t much mentioned it given the focus on the
                    biological side of neuroscience, but psychiatry and psychology have of course developed <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wps.21203" target="_blank">a wide
                        repertoire of behavioral interventions</a> over the 20th century; it stands to reason that
                    AI
                    could accelerate these as well, both the development of new methods and helping patients to
                    adhere
                    to existing methods. More broadly, the idea of an “AI coach” who always helps you to be the best
                    version of yourself, who studies your interactions and helps you learn to be more effective,
                    seems
                    very promising.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It’s my guess that these four routes of progress working together would, as with physical disease, be
                on
                track to lead to the cure or prevention of most mental illness in the next 100 years even if AI was
                not
                involved – and thus might reasonably be completed in 5-10 AI-accelerated years. Concretely my guess
                at
                what will happen is something like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Most mental illness can probably be cured</strong>. I’m not an expert in psychiatric
                    disease
                    (my time in neuroscience was spent building probes to study small groups of neurons) but it’s my
                    guess that diseases like PTSD, depression, schizophrenia, addiction, etc. can be figured out and
                    very effectively treated via some combination of the four directions above. The answer is likely
                    to
                    be some combination of “something went wrong biochemically” (although it could be very complex)
                    and
                    “something went wrong with the neural network, at a high level”. That is, it’s a systems
                    neuroscience question—though that doesn’t gainsay the impact of the behavioral interventions
                    discussed above. Tools for measurement and intervention, especially in live humans, seem likely
                    to
                    lead to rapid iteration and progress.</li>
                <li><strong>Conditions that are very “structural” may be more difficult, but not
                        impossible</strong>.
                    There’s <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7016047/" target="_blank">some
                        evidence</a> that psychopathy is associated with obvious neuroanatomical differences – that
                    some
                    brain regions are simply smaller or less developed in psychopaths. Psychopaths are also believed
                    to
                    lack empathy from a young age; whatever is different about their brain, it was probably always
                    that
                    way. The same may be true of some intellectual disabilities, and perhaps other conditions.
                    Restructuring the brain sounds hard, but it also seems like a task with high returns to
                    intelligence. Perhaps there is some way to coax the adult brain into an earlier or more plastic
                    state where it can be reshaped. I’m very uncertain how possible this is, but my instinct is to
                    be
                    optimistic about what AI can invent here.</li>
                <li><strong>Effective genetic prevention of mental illness seems possible</strong>. Most mental
                    illness
                    is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9840515/" target="_blank">partially
                        heritable</a>, and genome-wide association studies are <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wps.21034" target="_blank">starting
                        to
                        gain traction</a> on identifying the relevant factors, which are often many in number. It
                    will
                    probably be possible to prevent most of these diseases via embryo screening, similar to the
                    story
                    with physical disease. One difference is that psychiatric disease is more likely to be polygenic
                    (many genes contribute), so due to complexity there’s an increased risk of unknowingly selecting
                    against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antagonistic_pleiotropy_hypothesis" target="_blank">positive traits that are correlated with disease</a>. Oddly however, in
                    recent
                    years GWAS studies seem to suggest that these <a href="https://academic.oup.com/humupd/advance-article/doi/10.1093/humupd/dmae012/7684172" target="_blank">correlations might have been overstated.</a> In any case, AI-accelerated
                    neuroscience may help us to figure these things out. Of course, embryo screening for complex
                    traits
                    raises a number of societal issues and will be controversial, though I would guess that most
                    people
                    would support screening for severe or debilitating mental illness.</li>
                <li><strong>Everyday problems that we don’t think of as clinical disease will also be
                        solved</strong>.
                    Most of us have everyday psychological problems that are not ordinarily thought of as rising to
                    the
                    level of clinical disease. Some people are quick to anger, others have trouble focusing or are
                    often
                    drowsy, some are fearful or anxious, or react badly to change. Today, drugs already exist to
                    help
                    with e.g. alertness or focus (caffeine, modafinil, ritalin) but as with many other previous
                    areas,
                    much more is likely to be possible. Probably many more such drugs exist and have not been
                    discovered, and there may also be totally new modalities of intervention, such as targeted light
                    stimulation (see optogenetics above) or magnetic fields. Given how many drugs we’ve developed in
                    the
                    20th century that tune cognitive function and emotional state, I’m very optimistic about the
                    “compressed 21st” where everyone can get their brain to behave a bit better and have a more
                    fulfilling day-to-day experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Human baseline experience can be much better</strong>. Taking one step further, many
                    people
                    have experienced extraordinary moments of revelation, creative inspiration, compassion,
                    fulfillment,
                    transcendence, love, beauty, or meditative peace. The character and frequency of these
                    experiences
                    differs greatly from person to person and within the same person at different times, and can
                    also
                    sometimes be triggered by various drugs (though often with side effects). All of this suggests
                    that
                    the “space of what is possible to experience” is very broad and that a larger fraction of
                    people’s
                    lives could consist of these extraordinary moments. It is probably also possible to improve
                    various
                    cognitive functions across the board. This is perhaps the neuroscience version of “biological
                    freedom” or “extended lifespans”.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>One topic that often comes up in sci-fi depictions of AI, but that I intentionally haven’t discussed
                here, is “mind uploading”, the idea of capturing the pattern and dynamics of a human brain and
                instantiating them in software. This topic could be the subject of an essay all by itself, but
                suffice
                it to say that while I think uploading is almost certainly <a href="https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/brain-emulation-roadmap-report.pdf" target="_blank">possible</a>
                in
                principle, in practice it faces significant technological and societal challenges, even with
                powerful
                AI, that likely put it outside the 5-10 year window we are discussing.</p>
            <p>In summary, AI-accelerated neuroscience is likely to vastly improve treatments for, or even cure,
                most
                mental illness as well as greatly expand “cognitive and mental freedom” and human cognitive and
                emotional abilities. It will be every bit as radical as the improvements in physical health
                described in
                the previous section. Perhaps the world will not be visibly different on the outside, but the world
                as
                experienced by humans will be a much better and more humane place, as well as a place that offers
                greater opportunities for self-actualization. I also suspect that improved mental health will
                ameliorate
                a lot of other societal problems, including ones that seem political or economic.</p>
            <h2>3. Economic development and poverty</h2>
            <p>The previous two sections are about <i>developing</i> new technologies that cure disease and improve
                the
                quality of human life. However an obvious question, from a humanitarian perspective, is: “will
                everyone
                have access to these technologies?”</p>
            <p>It is one thing to develop a cure for a disease, it is another thing to eradicate the disease from
                the
                world. More broadly, many existing health interventions have not yet been applied everywhere in the
                world, and for that matter the same is true of (non-health) technological improvements in general.
                Another way to say this is that living standards in many parts of the world are still desperately
                poor:
                <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD" target="_blank">GDP per capita</a> is
                ~$2,000 in Sub-Saharan Africa as compared to ~$75,000 in the United States. If AI further increases
                economic growth and quality of life in the developed world, while doing little to help the
                developing
                world, we should view that as a terrible moral failure and a blemish on the genuine humanitarian
                victories in the previous two sections. Ideally, powerful AI should help the developing world
                <i>catch
                    up to</i> the developed world, even as it revolutionizes the latter.
            </p>
            <p>I am not as confident that AI can address inequality and economic growth as I am that it can invent
                fundamental technologies, because technology has such obvious high returns to intelligence
                (including
                the ability to route around complexities and lack of data) whereas the economy involves a lot of
                constraints from humans, as well as a large dose of intrinsic complexity. I am somewhat skeptical
                that
                an AI could solve the famous “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_calculation_debate#:~:text=The%20socialist%20calculation%20debate%2C%20sometimes,of%20the%20means%20of%20production." target="_blank">socialist calculation problem</a>”<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23">23</a></sup> and I don’t think governments will (or should) turn over their
                economic policy to such an entity, even if it could do so. There are also problems like how to
                convince
                people to take treatments that are effective but that they may be suspicious of.</p>
            <p>The challenges facing the developing world are made even more complicated by <a href="https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/publications/120224%20Corruption%20Review%20Final.pdf" target="_blank">pervasive corruption</a> in both
                private and public sectors. Corruption creates a vicious cycle: it <a href="https://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/pnacw645.pdf" target="_blank">exacerbates poverty</a>, and
                poverty in
                turn breeds more corruption. AI-driven plans for economic development need to reckon with corruption,
                weak institutions, and other very human challenges. </p>
            <p>Nevertheless, I do see significant reasons for optimism. Diseases <i>have</i> been eradicated and many
                countries
                <i>have</i> gone from poor to rich, and it is clear that the decisions involved in these tasks exhibit
                high
                returns to intelligence (despite human constraints and complexity). Therefore, AI can likely do them
                better than they are currently being done. There may also be targeted interventions that get around the
                human constraints and that AI could focus on. More importantly though, <i>we have</i> to try. Both AI
                companies
                and developed world policymakers will need to do their part to ensure that the developing world is not
                left out; the moral imperative is too great. So in this section, I’ll continue to make the optimistic
                case, but keep in mind everywhere that success is not guaranteed and depends on our collective efforts.
            </p>
            <p>Below I make some guesses about how I think things may go in the developing world over the 5-10 years
                after powerful AI is developed:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Distribution of health interventions</strong>. The area where I am perhaps most
                    optimistic
                    is distributing health interventions throughout the world. Diseases have actually been
                    eradicated by
                    top-down campaigns: smallpox was <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/spotlight/history-of-vaccination/history-of-smallpox-vaccination" target="_blank">fully eliminated</a> in the 1970’s, and polio and guinea worm are nearly
                    eradicated with less than 100 cases per year. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Disease_Modeling" target="_blank">Mathematically sophisticated epidemiological modeling</a> plays an active
                    role
                    in disease eradication campaigns, and it seems very likely that there is room for
                    smarter-than-human
                    AI systems to do a better job of it than humans are. The logistics of distribution can probably
                    also
                    be greatly optimized. One thing I learned as an early donor to <a href="https://www.givewell.org/" target="_blank">GiveWell</a> is that some health charities
                    are way more effective than others;
                    the hope is that AI-accelerated efforts would be more effective still. Additionally, some
                    biological
                    advances actually make the logistics of distribution much easier: for example, malaria has been
                    difficult to eradicate because it requires treatment each time the disease is contracted; a
                    vaccine
                    that only needs to be administered once makes the logistics much simpler (and such vaccines for
                    malaria <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria_vaccine" target="_blank">are in fact
                        currently being developed</a>). Even simpler distribution mechanisms are possible: some
                    diseases
                    could in principle be eradicated by targeting their animal carriers, for example releasing
                    mosquitoes infected with a bacterium that <a href="https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/south-american-cities-release-mosquitoes-stem-disease" target="_blank">blocks their ability</a> to carry a disease (who then infect all the other
                    mosquitos) or simply using <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-021-00386-0" target="_blank">gene drives</a> to wipe out the mosquitos. This requires one or a few
                    centralized actions, rather than a coordinated campaign that must individually treat millions.
                    Overall, I think 5-10 years is a reasonable timeline for a good fraction (maybe 50%) of
                    AI-driven
                    health benefits to propagate to even the poorest countries in the world. A good goal might be
                    for
                    the developing world 5-10 years after powerful AI to at least be substantially healthier than
                    the
                    developed world is today, even if it continues to lag behind the developed world. Accomplishing
                    this
                    will of course require a huge effort in global health, philanthropy, political advocacy, and
                    many
                    other efforts, which both AI developers and policymakers should help with.</li>
                <li><strong>Economic growth</strong>. Can the developing world quickly catch up to the developed
                    world,
                    not just in health, but across the board economically? There is some precedent for this: in the
                    final decades of the 20th century, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Asian_Tigers" target="_blank">several East Asian economies</a> achieved sustained ~10% annual real GDP
                    growth
                    rates, allowing them to catch up with the developed world. Human economic planners made the
                    decisions that led to this success, not by directly controlling entire economies but by pulling
                    a
                    few key levers (such as an industrial policy of export-led growth, and resisting the temptation
                    to
                    rely on natural resource wealth); it’s plausible that “AI finance ministers and central bankers”
                    could replicate or exceed this 10% accomplishment. An important question is how to get
                    developing
                    world governments to adopt them while respecting the principle of self-determination—some may be
                    enthusiastic about it, but others are likely to be skeptical. On the optimistic side, many of
                    the
                    health interventions in the previous bullet point are likely to organically increase economic
                    growth: eradicating AIDS/malaria/parasitic worms would have a transformative effect on
                    productivity,
                    not to mention the economic benefits that some of the neuroscience interventions (such as
                    improved
                    mood and focus) would have in developed and developing world alike. Finally, non-health
                    AI-accelerated technology (such as energy technology, transport drones, improved building
                    materials,
                    better logistics and distribution, and so on) may simply permeate the world naturally; for
                    example,
                    even cell phones quickly permeated sub-Saharan Africa via market mechanisms, without needing
                    philanthropic efforts. On the more negative side, while AI and automation have many potential
                    benefits, they also pose challenges for economic development, particularly for countries that
                    haven't yet industrialized. Finding ways to ensure these countries can still develop and improve
                    their economies in an age of increasing automation is an important challenge for economists and
                    policymakers to address. Overall, a dream scenario—perhaps a goal to aim for—would be 20% annual
                    GDP
                    growth rate in the developing world, with 10% each coming from AI-enabled economic decisions and
                    the
                    natural spread of AI-accelerated technologies, including but not limited to health. If achieved,
                    this would bring sub-Saharan Africa to the current per-capita GDP of China in 5-10 years, while
                    raising much of the rest of the developing world to levels higher than the current US GDP.
                    Again,
                    this is a dream scenario, not what happens by default: it’s something all of us must work
                    together
                    to make more likely.</li>
                <li><strong>Food security <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24">24</a></sup></strong>. Advances in crop technology like better
                    fertilizers and
                    pesticides, more automation, and more efficient land use drastically increased <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/crop-yields" target="_blank">crop yields</a> across the
                    20th
                    Century, saving millions of people from hunger. Genetic engineering is <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/new-genetic-tricks-boosting-crop-yield-take-clues-ancient-farmers" target="_blank">currently improving</a> many crops even further. Finding even more ways to
                    do
                    this—as well as to make agricultural supply chains even more efficient—could give us an
                    AI-driven
                    second <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Revolution" target="_blank">Green
                        Revolution</a>, helping close the gap between the developing and developed world.</li>
                <li><strong>Mitigating climate change</strong>. Climate change will be felt much more strongly in
                    the
                    developing world, hampering its development. We can expect that AI will lead to improvements in
                    technologies that slow or prevent climate change, from atmospheric <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-023-01604-9" target="_blank">carbon-removal</a>
                    and
                    clean energy technology to <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-animal-021022-055132" target="_blank">lab-grown meat</a> that reduces our reliance on carbon-intensive factory
                    farming. Of course, as discussed above, technology isn’t the only thing restricting progress on
                    climate change—as with all of the other issues discussed in this essay, human societal factors
                    are
                    important. But there’s good reason to think that AI-enhanced research will give us the means to
                    make
                    mitigating climate change far less costly and disruptive, rendering many of the objections moot
                    and
                    freeing up developing countries to make more economic progress.</li>
                <li><strong>Inequality within countries</strong>. I’ve mostly talked about inequality as a global
                    phenomenon (which I do think is its most important manifestation), but of course inequality also
                    exists <i>within</i> countries. With advanced health interventions and especially radical
                    increases
                    in lifespan or cognitive enhancement drugs, there will certainly be valid worries that these
                    technologies are “only for the rich”. I am more optimistic about within-country inequality
                    especially in the developed world, for two reasons. First, markets function better in the
                    developed
                    world, and markets are typically good at bringing down the cost of high-value technologies over
                    time<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25">25</a></sup>. Second, developed
                    world
                    political institutions are more responsive to their citizens and have greater state capacity to
                    execute universal access programs—and I expect citizens to demand access to technologies that so
                    radically improve quality of life. Of course it’s not predetermined that such demands
                    succeed—and
                    here is another place where we collectively have to do all we can to ensure a fair society.
                    There is
                    a separate problem in inequality of <i>wealth</i> (as opposed to inequality of access to
                    life-saving
                    and life-enhancing technologies), which seems harder and which I discuss in Section 5.</li>
                <li><strong>The opt-out problem</strong>. One concern in both developed and developing world alike
                    is
                    people <i>opting out</i> of AI-enabled benefits (similar to the anti-vaccine movement, or
                    Luddite
                    movements more generally). There could end up being bad feedback cycles where, for example, the
                    people who are least able to make good decisions opt out of the very technologies that improve
                    their
                    decision-making abilities, leading to an ever-increasing gap and even creating a dystopian
                    underclass (some researchers have argued that this will <a href="https://benmgarfinkel.blog/2021/02/26/is-democracy-a-fad/" target="_blank">undermine
                        democracy</a>, a topic I discuss further in the next section). This would, once again, place
                    a
                    moral blemish on AI’s positive advances. This is a difficult problem to solve as I don’t think
                    it is
                    ethically okay to coerce people, but we can at least try to increase people’s scientific
                    understanding—and perhaps AI itself can help us with this. One hopeful sign is that historically
                    anti-technology movements have been more bark than bite: railing against modern technology is
                    popular, but most people adopt it in the end, at least when it’s a matter of individual choice.
                    Individuals tend to adopt most health and consumer technologies, while technologies that are
                    truly
                    hampered, like nuclear power, tend to be collective political decisions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Overall, I am optimistic about quickly bringing AI’s biological advances to people in the developing
                world. I am hopeful, though not confident, that AI can also enable unprecedented economic growth
                rates
                and allow the developing world to at least surpass where the developed world is now. I am concerned
                about the “opt out” problem in both the developed and developing world, but suspect that it will
                peter
                out over time and that AI can help accelerate this process. It won’t be a perfect world, and those
                who
                are behind won’t fully catch up, at least not in the first few years. But with strong efforts on our
                part, we may be able to get things moving in the right direction—and fast. If we do, we can make at
                least a downpayment on the promises of dignity and equality that we owe to every human being on
                earth.

            <h2>4. Peace and governance</h2>
            <p>Suppose that everything in the first three sections goes well: disease, poverty, and inequality are
                significantly reduced and the baseline of human experience is raised substantially. It does not
                follow
                that all major causes of human suffering are solved. Humans are still a threat to each other<i>.</i>
                Although there is a trend of technological improvement and economic development <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Better_Angels_of_Our_Nature" target="_blank">leading to
                    democracy and peace</a>, it is a very loose trend, with frequent (and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/countries-democracies-autocracies-row" target="_blank">recent</a>) backsliding. At the dawn of the 20th Century, people <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Illusion" target="_blank">thought</a> they had put
                war
                behind them; then came the two world wars. Thirty years ago Francis Fukuyama wrote about “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_History_and_the_Last_Man" target="_blank">the End
                    of
                    History</a>” and a final triumph of liberal democracy; that hasn’t happened yet. Twenty years
                ago US
                policymakers believed that free trade with China would cause it to liberalize as it became richer;
                that
                very much didn’t happen, and we now seem <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/why-the-us-should-fight-cold-war" target="_blank">headed for
                    a
                    second cold war</a> with a resurgent authoritarian bloc. And plausible theories suggest that
                internet technology <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/the-super-scary-theory-of-the-21st-a3a" target="_blank">may actually advantage authoritarianism</a>, not democracy as initially believed
                (e.g. in the “Arab Spring” period). It seems important to try to understand how powerful AI will
                intersect with these issues of peace, democracy, and freedom.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, I see no strong reason to believe AI will preferentially or structurally advance
                democracy
                and peace, in the same way that I think it will structurally advance human health and alleviate
                poverty.
                Human conflict is adversarial and AI can in principle help both the “good guys” and the “bad guys”.
                If
                anything, some structural factors seem worrying: AI seems likely to enable much better propaganda
                and
                surveillance, both major tools in the autocrat’s toolkit. It’s therefore up to us as individual
                actors
                to tilt things in the right direction: if we want AI to favor democracy and individual rights, we
                are
                going to have to fight for that outcome. I feel even more strongly about this than I do about
                international inequality: the triumph of liberal democracy and political stability is <i>not</i>
                guaranteed, perhaps not even likely, and will require great sacrifice and commitment on all of our
                parts, as it often has in the past.</p>
            <p>I think of the issue as having two parts: international conflict, and the internal structure of
                nations.
                On the international side, it seems very important that democracies have the upper hand on the world
                stage when powerful AI is created. AI-powered authoritarianism seems too terrible to contemplate, so
                democracies need to be able to set the terms by which powerful AI is brought into the world, both to
                avoid being overpowered by authoritarians and to prevent human rights abuses within authoritarian
                countries.</p>
            <p>My current guess at the best way to do this is via an “entente strategy”<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26">26</a></sup>, in which a coalition of democracies seeks
                to
                gain a clear advantage (even just a temporary one) on powerful AI by securing its supply chain,
                scaling
                quickly, and <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/updated-october-7-semiconductor-export-controls" target="_blank">blocking or delaying</a> adversaries’ access to key resources like chips and
                semiconductor equipment. This coalition would on one hand use AI to achieve robust military
                superiority
                (the stick) while at the same time offering to distribute the benefits of powerful AI (the carrot)
                to a
                wider and wider group of countries in exchange for supporting the coalition’s strategy to promote
                democracy (this would be a bit analogous to “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atoms_for_Peace" target="_blank">Atoms for Peace</a>”). The coalition would aim to gain the support of more and
                more
                of the world, isolating our worst adversaries and eventually putting them in a position where they
                are
                better off taking the same bargain as the rest of the world: give up competing with democracies in
                order
                to receive all the benefits and not fight a superior foe.</p>
            <p>If we can do all this, we will have a world in which democracies lead on the world stage and have the
                economic and military strength to avoid being undermined, conquered, or sabotaged by autocracies,
                and
                may be able to parlay their AI superiority into a durable advantage. This could optimistically lead
                to
                an “eternal 1991”—a world where democracies have the upper hand and Fukuyama’s dreams are realized.
                Again, this will be very difficult to achieve, and will in particular require close cooperation
                between
                private AI companies and democratic governments, as well as extraordinarily wise decisions about the
                balance between carrot and stick.</p>
            <p>Even if all that goes well, it leaves the question of the fight between democracy and autocracy
                <i>within</i> each country. It is obviously hard to predict what will happen here, but I do have
                some
                optimism that <i>given</i> a global environment in which democracies control the most powerful AI,
                <i>then</i> AI may actually structurally favor democracy everywhere. In particular, in this
                environment
                democratic governments can use their superior AI to win the information war: they can counter
                influence
                and propaganda operations by autocracies and may even be able to create a globally free information
                environment by providing channels of information and AI services in a way that autocracies lack the
                technical ability to block or monitor. It probably isn’t necessary to deliver propaganda, only to
                counter malicious attacks and unblock the free flow of information. Although not immediate, a level
                playing field like this stands a good chance of gradually tilting global governance towards
                democracy,
                for several reasons.
            </p>
            <p>First, the increases in quality of life in Sections 1-3 should, all things equal, promote democracy:
                historically they have, to at least some extent. In particular I expect improvements in mental
                health,
                well-being, and education to increase democracy, as all three are <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11482-022-10070-y" target="_blank">negatively</a>
                <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/abs/who-is-open-to-authoritarian-governance-within-western-democracies/0ADCD5FFE5B7E9267E8283C7561FB6BE" target="_blank">correlated</a> with support for authoritarian leaders. In general people want
                more
                self-expression when their other needs are met, and democracy is among other things a form of
                self-expression. Conversely, authoritarianism thrives on fear and resentment.
            </p>
            <p>Second, there is a good chance free information really does undermine authoritarianism, as long as
                the
                authoritarians can’t censor it. And uncensored AI can also bring individuals powerful tools for
                undermining repressive governments. Repressive governments survive by denying people a certain kind
                of
                common knowledge, keeping them from realizing that “the emperor has no clothes”. For example <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sr%C4%91a_Popovi%C4%87_(activist)" target="_blank">Srđa
                    Popović</a>, who helped to topple the Milošević government in Serbia, has written extensively
                about
                techniques for psychologically robbing authoritarians of their power, for breaking the spell and
                rallying support against a dictator. A superhumanly effective AI version of Popović (whose skills
                seem
                like they have high returns to intelligence) in everyone’s pocket, one that dictators are powerless
                to
                block or censor, could create a wind at the backs of dissidents and reformers across the world. To
                say
                it again, this will be a long and protracted fight, one where victory is not assured, but if we
                design
                and build AI in the right way, it may at least be a fight where the advocates of freedom everywhere
                have
                an advantage.</p>
            <p>As with neuroscience and biology, we can also ask how things could be “better than normal”—not just
                how
                to avoid autocracy, but how to make democracies better than they are today. Even within democracies,
                injustices happen all the time. Rule-of-law societies make a promise to their citizens that everyone
                will be equal under the law and everyone is entitled to basic human rights, but obviously people do
                not
                always receive those rights in practice. That this promise is even partially fulfilled makes it
                something to be proud of, but can AI help us do better?</p>
            <p>For example, could AI improve our legal and judicial system by making decisions and processes more
                impartial? Today people mostly worry in legal or judicial contexts that AI systems will be a <a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/23738987/racism-ai-automated-bias-discrimination-algorithm" target="_blank"><i>cause</i> of discrimination</a>, and these worries are important and need to
                be
                defended against. At the same time, the vitality of democracy depends on harnessing new technologies
                to
                improve democratic institutions, not just responding to risks. A truly mature and successful
                implementation of AI has the potential to <i>reduce</i> bias and be fairer for everyone.</p>
            <p>For centuries, legal systems have faced the dilemma that the law aims to be impartial, but is
                inherently
                subjective and thus must be interpreted by biased humans. Trying to make the law fully mechanical
                hasn’t
                worked because the real world is messy and can’t always be captured in mathematical formulas.
                Instead
                legal systems rely on notoriously imprecise criteria like “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruel_and_unusual_punishment" target="_blank">cruel and
                    unusual
                    punishment</a>” or “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roth_v._United_States" target="_blank">utterly without redeeming social importance</a>”, which humans then
                interpret—and
                often do so in a manner that displays bias, favoritism, or arbitrariness. “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract" target="_blank">Smart contracts</a>” in
                cryptocurrencies haven’t revolutionized law because ordinary code isn’t smart enough to adjudicate
                all
                that much of interest. But AI might be smart enough for this: it is the first technology capable of
                making broad, fuzzy judgements in a repeatable and mechanical way.</p>
            <p>I am not suggesting that we literally replace judges with AI systems, but the combination of
                impartiality
                with the ability to understand and process messy, real world situations <i>feels</i> like it should
                have
                some serious positive applications to law and justice. At the very least, such systems could work
                alongside humans as an aid to decision-making. Transparency would be important in any such system,
                and a
                mature science of AI could conceivably provide it: the training process for such systems could be
                extensively studied, and <a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/" target="_blank">advanced
                    interpretability techniques</a> could be used to see inside the final model and assess it for
                hidden
                biases, in a way that is simply not possible with humans. Such AI tools could also be used to
                monitor
                for violations of fundamental rights in a judicial or police context, making constitutions more
                self-enforcing.</p>
            <p>In a similar vein, AI could be used to both aggregate opinions and drive consensus among citizens,
                resolving conflict, finding common ground, and seeking compromise. Some early ideas in this
                direction
                have been undertaken by the <a href="https://compdemocracy.org/" target="_blank">computational
                    democracy
                    project</a>, including <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/collective-constitutional-ai-aligning-a-language-model-with-public-input" target="_blank">collaborations with Anthropic</a>. A more informed and thoughtful citizenry
                would
                obviously strengthen democratic institutions.</p>
            <p>There is also a clear opportunity for AI to be used to help provision government services—such as
                health
                benefits or social services—that are in principle available to everyone but in practice often
                severely
                lacking, and worse in some places than others. This includes health services, the DMV, taxes, social
                security, building code enforcement, and so on. Having a very thoughtful and informed AI whose job
                is to
                give you everything you’re legally entitled to by the government in a way you can understand—and who
                also helps you comply with often confusing government rules—would be a big deal. Increasing state
                capacity both helps to deliver on the promise of equality under the law, and strengthens respect for
                democratic governance. Poorly implemented services are currently a major driver of cynicism about
                government<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27">27</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>All of these are somewhat vague ideas, and as I said at the beginning of this section, I am not
                nearly as
                confident in their feasibility as I am in the advances in biology, neuroscience, and poverty
                alleviation. They may be unrealistically utopian. But the important thing is to have an ambitious
                vision, to be willing to dream big and try things out. The vision of AI as a guarantor of liberty,
                individual rights, and equality under the law is too powerful a vision not to fight for. A 21st
                century,
                AI-enabled polity could be both a stronger protector of individual freedom, and a beacon of hope
                that
                helps make liberal democracy the form of government that the whole world wants to adopt.</p>
            <h2>5. Work and meaning</h2>
            <p>Even if everything in the preceding four sections goes well—not only do we alleviate disease,
                poverty,
                and inequality, but liberal democracy becomes the dominant form of government, and existing liberal
                democracies become better versions of themselves—at least one important question still remains.
                “It’s
                great we live in such a technologically advanced world as well as a fair and decent one”, someone
                might
                object, “but with AI’s doing everything, how will humans have meaning? For that matter, how will
                they
                survive economically?”.</p>
            <p>I think this question is more difficult than the others. I don’t mean that I am necessarily more
                pessimistic about it than I am about the other questions (although I do see challenges). I mean that
                it
                is fuzzier and harder to predict in advance, because it relates to macroscopic questions about how
                society is organized that tend to resolve themselves only over time and in a decentralized manner.
                For
                example, historical hunter-gatherer societies might have imagined that life is meaningless without
                hunting and various kinds of hunting-related religious rituals, and would have imagined that our
                well-fed technological society is devoid of purpose. They might also have not understood how our
                economy
                can provide for everyone, or what function people can usefully service in a mechanized society.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, it’s worth saying at least a few words, while keeping in mind that the brevity of this
                section is not at all to be taken as a sign that I don’t take these issues seriously—on the
                contrary, it
                is a sign of a lack of clear answers.</p>
            <p>On the question of meaning, I think it is very likely a mistake to believe that tasks you undertake
                are
                meaningless simply because an AI could do them better. Most people are not the best in the world at
                anything, and it doesn’t seem to bother them particularly much. Of course today they can still
                contribute through comparative advantage, and may derive meaning from the economic value they
                produce,
                but people also greatly enjoy activities that produce no economic value. I spend plenty of time
                playing
                video games, swimming, walking around outside, and talking to friends, all of which generates zero
                economic value. I might spend a day trying to get better at a video game, or faster at biking up a
                mountain, and it doesn’t really matter to me that someone somewhere is much better at those things.
                In
                any case I think meaning comes mostly from human relationships and connection, not from economic
                labor.
                People do want a sense of accomplishment, even a sense of competition, and in a post-AI world it
                will be
                perfectly possible to spend years attempting some very difficult task with a complex strategy,
                similar
                to what people do today when they embark on research projects, try to become Hollywood actors, or
                found
                companies<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28">28</a></sup>. The facts that (a)
                an AI
                somewhere could in principle do this task better, and (b) this task is no longer an economically
                rewarded element of a global economy, don’t seem to me to matter very much.</p>
            <p>The economic piece actually seems more difficult to me than the meaning piece. By “economic” in this
                section I mean the possible problem that <i>most or all</i> humans may not be able to contribute
                meaningfully to a sufficiently advanced AI-driven economy. This is a more macro problem than the
                separate problem of inequality, especially inequality in access to the new technologies, which I
                discussed in Section 3.</p>
            <p>First of all, in the short term I agree with arguments that comparative advantage will continue to
                keep
                <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/plentiful-high-paying-jobs-in-the" target="_blank">humans
                    relevant</a> and in fact increase their productivity, and may even in some ways <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w31161" target="_blank">level the playing field between
                    humans</a>. As long as AI is only better at 90% of a given job, the other 10% will cause humans
                to
                become highly leveraged, increasing compensation and in fact creating a bunch of new human jobs
                complementing and amplifying what AI is good at, such that the “10%” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lump_of_labour_fallacy" target="_blank">expands to continue
                    to
                    employ almost everyone</a>. In fact, even if AI can do 100% of things better than humans, but it
                remains inefficient or expensive at some tasks, or if the resource <i>inputs</i> to humans and AI’s
                are
                meaningfully different, then the logic of comparative advantage continues to apply. One area humans
                are
                likely to maintain a relative (or even absolute) advantage for a significant time is the physical
                world.
                Thus, I think that the human economy may continue to make sense even a little past the point where
                we
                reach “a country of geniuses in a datacenter”.
            </p>
            <p>However, I do think in the long run AI will become so broadly effective and so cheap that this will
                no
                longer apply. At that point our current economic setup will no longer make sense, and there will be
                a
                need for a broader societal conversation about how the economy should be organized.</p>
            <p>While that might sound crazy, the fact is that civilization has successfully navigated major economic
                shifts in the past: from hunter-gathering to farming, farming to feudalism, and feudalism to
                industrialism. I suspect that some new and stranger thing will be needed, and that it’s something no
                one
                today has done a good job of envisioning. It could be as simple as a large universal basic income
                for
                everyone, although I suspect that will only be a small part of a solution. It could be a capitalist
                economy of AI systems, which then give out resources (huge amounts of them, since the overall
                economic
                pie will be gigantic) to humans based on some secondary economy of what the AI systems think makes
                sense
                to reward in humans (based on some judgment ultimately derived from human values). Perhaps the
                economy
                runs on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_and_Out_in_the_Magic_Kingdom" target="_blank">Whuffie points</a>. Or perhaps humans will continue to be economically valuable
                after all, in some way not anticipated by the usual economic models. All of these solutions have
                tons of
                possible problems, and it’s not possible to know whether they will make sense without lots of
                iteration
                and experimentation. And as with some of the other challenges, we will likely have to fight to get a
                good outcome here: exploitative or dystopian directions are clearly also possible and have to be
                prevented. Much more could be written about these questions and I hope to do so at some later time.
            </p>
            <h2>Taking stock</h2>
            <p>Through the varied topics above, I’ve tried to lay out a vision of a world that is both plausible
                <i>if</i> everything goes right with AI, and much better than the world today. I don’t know if this
                world is realistic, and even if it is, it will not be achieved without a huge amount of effort and
                struggle by many brave and dedicated people. Everyone (including AI companies!) will need to do
                their
                part both to prevent risks and to fully realize the benefits.
            </p>
            <p>But it is a world worth fighting for. If all of this really does happen over 5 to 10 years—the defeat
                of
                most diseases, the growth in biological and cognitive freedom, the lifting of billions of people out
                of
                poverty to share in the new technologies, a renaissance of liberal democracy and human rights—I
                suspect
                everyone watching it will be surprised by the effect it has on them. I don’t mean the experience of
                personally benefiting from all the new technologies, although that will certainly be amazing. I mean
                the
                experience of watching a long-held set of ideals materialize in front of us all at once. I think
                many
                will be literally moved to tears by it.</p>
            <p>Throughout writing this essay I noticed an interesting tension. In one sense the vision laid out here
                is
                extremely radical: it is not what almost anyone expects to happen in the next decade, and will
                likely
                strike many as an absurd fantasy. Some may not even consider it desirable; it embodies values and
                political choices that not everyone will agree with. But at the same time there is something
                blindingly
                obvious—something overdetermined—about it, as if many different attempts to envision a good world
                inevitably lead roughly here.</p>
            <p>In Iain M. Banks’ <a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/iain-m-banks/the-player-of-games/9780316005401/" target="_blank"><i>The Player of Games</i></a><sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29">29</a></sup>, the protagonist—a member of a society called the Culture, which
                is
                based on principles not unlike those I’ve laid out here—travels to a repressive, militaristic empire
                in
                which leadership is determined by competition in an intricate battle game. The game, however, is
                complex
                enough that a player’s strategy within it tends to reflect their own political and philosophical
                outlook. The protagonist manages to defeat the emperor in the game, showing that his values (the
                Culture’s values) represent a winning strategy even in a game designed by a society based on
                ruthless
                competition and survival of the fittest. <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/08/17/the-goddess-of-everything-else-2/" target="_blank">A
                    well-known post</a> by Scott Alexander has the same thesis—that competition is self-defeating
                and
                tends to lead to a society based on compassion and cooperation. The “<a href="https://www.si.edu/spotlight/mlk?page=4&amp;iframe=true" target="_blank">arc of the moral
                    universe</a>” is another similar concept.</p>
            <p>I think the Culture’s values are a winning strategy because they’re the sum of a million small
                decisions
                that have clear moral force and that tend to pull everyone together onto the same side. Basic human
                intuitions of fairness, cooperation, curiosity, and autonomy are hard to argue with, and are
                cumulative
                in a way that our more destructive impulses often aren’t. It is easy to argue that children
                shouldn’t
                die of disease if we can prevent it, and easy from there to argue that <i>everyone’s</i> children
                deserve that right equally. From there it is not hard to argue that we should all band together and
                apply our intellects to achieve this outcome. Few disagree that people should be punished for
                attacking
                or hurting others unnecessarily, and from there it’s not much of a leap to the idea that punishments
                should be consistent and systematic across people. It is similarly intuitive that people should have
                autonomy and responsibility over their own lives and choices. These simple intuitions, if taken to
                their
                logical conclusion, lead eventually to rule of law, democracy, and Enlightenment values. If not
                inevitably, then at least as a statistical tendency, this is where humanity was already headed. AI
                simply offers an opportunity to get us there more quickly—to make the logic starker and the
                destination
                clearer.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, it is a thing of transcendent beauty. We have the opportunity to play some small role
                in
                making it real.</p>

                            I think those people need to, in Twitter parlance, “touch grass”. But more importantly,

                            at once, and the pace I’m describing is probably close to the limits of what society can

                            hype. I prefer "powerful AI" or "Expert-Level Science and Engineering" which get at what

                        <p><sup>4</sup>In this essay, I use "intelligence" to refer to a general problem-solving
                            capability that can be
                            applied across diverse domains. This includes abilities like reasoning, learning, planning,
                            and
                            creativity. While I use "intelligence" as a shorthand throughout this essay, I acknowledge
                            that the
                            nature of intelligence is a complex and debated topic in cognitive science and AI research.
                            Some
                            researchers argue that intelligence isn't a single, unified concept but rather a collection
                            of
                            separate cognitive abilities. Others contend that there's a general factor of intelligence
                            (g
                            factor) underlying various cognitive skills. That’s a debate for another time. <a href="#fnref:4">↩</a></p>

                            page of text in a couple seconds and write a page of text in maybe 20 seconds, which is
                            10-100x the speed at which humans can do these things. Over time larger models tend to
                            make
                            this slower but more powerful chips tend to make it faster; to date the two effects have

                            create even more powerful AI. My assumption is that this might (in fact, probably will)
                            occur, but that its effect will be smaller than you might imagine, precisely because of
                            the
                            “decreasing marginal returns to intelligence” discussed here. In other words, AI will
                            continue to get smarter quickly, but its effect will eventually be limited by
                            non-intelligence factors, and analyzing those is what matters most to the speed of

							<p><strong>Clinical Relevance: Brain zaps are a disconcerting symptom of antidepressant withdrawal that should be addressed</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Brain zaps, a symptom of antidepressant discontinuation syndrome (ADS), are distressing and mysterious sensations experienced when stepping off SSRIs.</li>
<li>Physicians were initially unaware or dismissive of brain zaps due to limited information and a focus on downplaying the addictive nature of antidepressants.</li>
<li>Gradual tapering, switching to fluoxetine, and CBT during the discontinuation process can help mitigate brain zaps and other ADS symptoms.</li>
</ul>
                        </div>
					<p><span>A sensation unofficially known as “brain zaps” has caused concern in patients stepping off of their SSRIs. Until recently, physicians have widely been unaware or dismissive of the symptom.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.pointlomaclinic.com/providers"><span>Alexander Papp</span></a><span>, MD, who has led </span><a href="https://www.psychiatrist.com/pcc/brain-zaps/"><span>studies</span></a><span> published in <em>The Primary Care Companion for CNS Disorders</em> examining brain zaps, believes this may simply be due to the lack of available information.</span></p>
<p><span>“There was an emphasis both within the [psychiatric] profession and pharmacological companies to make these medications sound not addictive,” he told </span><i><span>Psychiatrist.com</span></i><span>. Therefore, when SSRIs first became popular, very few systematic studies were conducted on antidepressant discontinuation effects.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.psychiatrist.com/jcp/functioning-and-life-engagement-treatment-goals-in-mdd/">Treatment Goals in MDD</a></p>
<p><span><br>
The tide seems to be shifting. Psychiatrists better understand a collection of&nbsp; symptoms that accompany stepping off of antidepressant use known as <a href="https://www.psychiatrist.com/jcp/antidepressant-discontinuation-syndrome-suicide-attempt/">antidepressant discontinuation syndrome</a> (ADS). But brain zaps still remain a bit of a mystery.</span></p>
<h3><b>An Off-Putting Sensation</b></h3>
<p><span>Brain zaps are a relatively uncommon ADS symptom. Those who have them say they can be quite distressing.</span></p>
<p><span>“The way it’s described, they feel like an electrical sensation in the brain as if you were shocked inside your head—which is unusual because people usually don’t feel anything inside their heads,” said Papp.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>He clarified that while zaps, which typically last about one second each, </span><i><span>feel</span></i><span> like they’re coming from inside the brain tissue, they actually occur on the surface and around the nerves surrounding the lining of the brain.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As far as scientists have been able to tell, brain zaps aren’t dangerous. But because the experience is so unfamiliar and uncomfortable, it is highly unsettling. “Some people think that they are having <a href="https://www.psychiatrist.com/neurology/seizure/">seizures</a>. Some people think that they’re having a heart attack. Some people have no idea what’s happening. It can be a very scary state to be in,” Papp said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Perhaps the most disconcerting feature of the zaps is the jumpy lateral eye movements. “People actually hear their eyes move when they move their eyes from left to right. They almost feel a faint ‘whoosh’ sound in their heads,” Papp explained. “Sometimes, people feel as if the brain stops for a moment and reboots like a computer.”</span></p>
<h3><b>Patient Reaction</b></h3>
<p><span>Zaps can cause <a href="https://www.psychiatrist.com/anxiety/">anxiety</a>. Some people also report vertigo, insomnia, vision changes and balance problems. </span><i><span>Psychiatrist.com </span></i><span>asked a group of Reddit users from various antidepressant-focused subreddits including, r/antidepressants and&nbsp; r/SSRIs, about what brain zaps feel like.</span></p>
<p><span>“Zaps are very similar to experiences I had after heavy weekends on ecstasy / MDMA in my younger years,” Reddit user u/heliskinki</span> <span>wrote in a direct message</span><i><span>.</span></i><span> “My brain ‘jumps’ forwards and I get a tingling feeling in my lips.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“They feel like jolts of electricity that make me stutter and force me to slow down,” explained u/CosmosisJone5.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The sensation caused u/Remmy1319 to re-evaluate their decision to discontinue Zoloft, a sentiment shared by a number of Redditors. “Tried to come off Zoloft and was zapped out of my mind. I was on my meds for 14 months and I’m already thinking that I don’t have what it takes to face the withdrawals,” one anonymous Redditor commented.</span></p>
<p><span>Some tapered off too quickly after experiencing unpleasant reactions to medication only to have those side effects replaced with withdrawal symptoms including brain zaps.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“I was on 10 mg [Citalopram] for two weeks before deciding to stop as the depersonalisation was too much, plus the chest pains. I tapered down to 5mg for two days then came off completely over the course of a week, before starting to get brain zaps intermittently throughout the day,” u/FillPleasant wrote in a comment.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Treatment Options</b></h3>
<p><span>The only thing that’s known to help prevent brain zaps is to stay on the <a href="https://www.psychiatrist.com/depression/">antidepressant</a>. Or at least avoid going cold turkey.</span></p>
<p><span>Taper off extremely slowly or, as Papp suggested, “You can switch from a short half-life medication to fluoxetine (Prozac) and then taper down from that.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Gradually reducing the antidepressant agent with a long half-life has indeed been shown to reduce the severity of brain zaps and other kinds of </span><a href="https://www.psychiatrist.com/jcp/discontinuing-antidepressants-how-can-clinicians-guide-patients-and-drive-research/"><span>discontinuation effects</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“It really seems to me that the speed of drop in blood level is the [factor] that is most likely responsible for these brain zaps,” Papp said. “The medications where blood level drops faster are the ones that are most likely to cause brain zaps.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Undergoing cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) during the tapering process may also help to decrease ADS symptoms, including the zaps. However, there’s no known cure, and for some people, they can be incredibly disruptive. Clinicians should note that they can become a barrier to successfully weaning off of medications, Papp advised.</span></p>
<p><span>Discontinuing or reducing antidepressant dosage or using these meds irregularly can cause a variety of other unpleasant symptoms, which can include flu-like symptoms, insomnia, nausea, imbalance, sensory disturbances, and hyperarousal.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“Eventually most people are able to get off their antidepressants, but there’s a small minority of people who are either never able to get off their antidepressants and continue to have these antidepressant discontinuation effects, including brain zaps, for years—sometimes even decades,” Papp said. </span></p>

<div id="article-body">
<p>A subtle change has arrived to the Steam shopping experience to drive home the fact that you're buying a game <em>license </em>rather than a copy of a game that you'll definitely own forever, and rival storefront GOG already seems to be weighing in on the matter.</p><p>As <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/steam-now-tells-gamers-up-front-that-theyre-buying-a-license-not-a-game-085106522.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/steam-now-tells-gamers-up-front-that-theyre-buying-a-license-not-a-game-085106522.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"><u>reported by Engadget</u></a>, if you're about to buy a new game on Steam, you'll now notice a new message pop up, which reads: "A purchase of a digital product grants a license for the product on Steam." This disclaimer appears as though it's likely related to a California law set to come into effect next year, which'll stop digital storefronts from using words like "buy" in relation to things like game licenses unless it's obvious what people are spending their money on, as part of a move to make it clearer to consumers what they actually own (or rather, what they <em>don't</em>).&nbsp;</p><p>Needless to say, this new message on Steam has already caused quite a stir, so much so that it's seemingly reached the ears of rival storefront GOG. GOG is famously free of digital rights management (DRM), and offers its customers offline installers for the games it sells which you can download onto your PC where they can remain safe forever, so it's understandable that the site might have some thoughts on all this.&nbsp;</p><p>"Since checkout banners are trending, we're thinking of putting one up ourselves," a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1844752098145038435" target="_blank" data-url="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1844752098145038435" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"><u>tweet posted on the official GOG Twitter</u></a> account reads. "Thoughts on this one?" The concept banner in question says: "A purchase of a digital product on GOG grants you its Offline Installers, which cannot be taken away from you."</p><p>As was pointed out as recently as September when GOG weighed in on the upcoming California law, however, it's worth noting that GOG does, in fact, sell licenses to games much like other storefronts. With that said, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/pc-gaming/as-california-forces-stores-to-admit-you-dont-own-digital-games-gog-reminds-pc-gamers-you-can-keep-drm-free-games-your-gaming-legacy-is-always-in-your-hands/" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/pc-gaming/as-california-forces-stores-to-admit-you-dont-own-digital-games-gog-reminds-pc-gamers-you-can-keep-drm-free-games-your-gaming-legacy-is-always-in-your-hands/"><u>it clarified at the time</u></a>: "When we said we let you 'own' your games, we meant that no matter what happens – whether it's licensing issues, storefronts shutting down, or even a zombie apocalypse cutting off your Internet – you'll still be able to play them thanks to our offline installers. We want to ensure your gaming legacy is always in your hands, not ours." With that in mind, there's no doubt many would argue that it's a better deal than what Steam offers.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Be sure to check out our recommendations for the </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/best-pc-games/" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.gamesradar.com/best-pc-games/"><u><em>best PC games</em></u></a><em>.</em></p><div data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-amWrMVdqPwh7TxvGcdx7NS"><section><p>Weekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more</p></section></div>

<div id="slice-container-authorBio-amWrMVdqPwh7TxvGcdx7NS"><p>I'm one of GamesRadar+'s news writers, who works alongside the rest of the news team to deliver cool gaming stories that we love. After spending more hours than I can count filling The University of Sheffield's student newspaper with Pokemon and indie game content, and picking up a degree in Journalism Studies, I started my career at GAMINGbible where I worked as a journalist for over a year and a half. I then became TechRadar Gaming's news writer, where I sourced stories and wrote about all sorts of intriguing topics. In my spare time, you're sure to find me on my Nintendo Switch or PS5 playing through story-driven RPGs like Xenoblade Chronicles and Persona 5 Royal, nuzlocking old Pokemon games, or going for a Victory Royale in Fortnite.</p></div>

<p>Gleam is a statically-typed functional programming language, <a href="https://gleam.run/news/gleam-version-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which recently had its v1 released</a>,  designed for building scalable and maintainable software. It is inspired by languages like Elm and Rust and compiles down to Erlang, making it well-suited for building concurrent and distributed systems. In this tutorial, we’ll cover the basics of Gleam to help you get started with this expressive and powerful language.</p>



<h2>Preparing the environment</h2>



<p>Before diving into Gleam, you need to set up the development environment. The language <strong>compiles to Erlang and Javascript</strong>, and while the second doesn’t require anything but a browser and the gleam compiler to run, the first will need the compiler, Erlang and Rebar3. Let’s focus on that:</p>



<ol>
<li>First, grab a pre-compiled version of Gleam here: <a href="https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/releases" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/releases</a></li>



<li>Then, install Erlang from the <a href="https://www.erlang-solutions.com/downloads/">Erlang-Solutions website</a>.</li>



<li>Finally, go to <a href="https://rebar3.org/docs/getting-started/#installing-from-the-rebar3-escript" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rebar3 “getting started” page</a> and follow their instructions. This tool will be necessary in certain cases, such as Web Servers and HTTP clients.</li>
</ol>



<p>With everything in place, <a href="https://gleam.run/getting-started/installing/#editor-plugins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">install a plugin to support syntax highlighting</a> in your editor of choice.</p>



<h2>Your First Gleam Program</h2>



<p>Let’s create a simple “Hello, World!” program to get started. Open your favorite text editor and create a file named <code>hello.gleam</code> with the following content:</p>



<pre><code>// hello.gleam
import gleam/io

pub fn main() {
  io.println("Hello, Gleam!")
}</code></pre>



<p>Save the file and run it using the Gleam compiler:</p>



<pre><code>gleam run hello.gleam</code></pre>



<p>You should see the output:</p>



<pre><code>Hello, Gleam!</code></pre>



<p>Congratulations! You’ve just written and executed your first Gleam program.</p>



<h2>Variables and Types</h2>



<p>Gleam is a statically-typed language, meaning you must declare the type of a variable before using it. Here’s an example demonstrating variable declaration and basic types:</p>



<pre><code>// variables.gleam
import gleam/io

pub fn main() {
  let message: String = "Hello, Gleam!"
  let number: Int = 42
  let is_true: Bool = True
  let ints = [1, 2, 3]

  io.debug(ints)
  io.debug(message)
  io.debug(number)
  io.debug(is_true)
}</code></pre>



<p>Run the program to see the output:</p>



<pre><code>gleam run variables.gleam</code></pre>



<p>As you may have noticed, this time we used <code>io.debug</code> instead of <code>io.println</code> . That is because the later only works with strings, while the first will print any type.</p>



<h2>Arithmetic Operations</h2>



<p>Gleam supports standard arithmetic operations for numerical values. Here’s a concise example demonstrating addition:</p>



<pre><code>import gleam/io
import gleam/int

pub fn main() {
  // Int arithmetic
  io.debug(1 + 1)
  io.debug(5 - 1)
  io.debug(5 / 2)
  io.debug(3 * 3)
  io.debug(5 % 2)

  // Int comparisons
  io.debug(2 &gt; 1)
  io.debug(2 &lt; 1)
  io.debug(2 &gt;= 1)
  io.debug(2 &lt;= 1)

  // Equality works for any type
  io.debug(1 == 1)
  io.debug(2 == 1)

  // Standard library int functions
  io.debug(int.max(42, 77)) //highest number
  io.debug(int.clamp(5, 10, 20))
}
</code></pre>



<p>In this program, the <code>+</code> operator adds the numbers 3 and 5. Run the program:</p>



<pre><code>gleam run arithmetic.gleam</code></pre>



<p>This should output:</p>



<pre><code>2
4
2
9
1
True
False
True
False
True
False
77
10</code></pre>



<h2>Functions</h2>



<p>Functions are a fundamental part of Gleam. Here’s an example of defining and calling a function:</p>



<pre><code>// functions.gleam
import gleam/io

pub fn main() {
  let result = add(3, 5)
  io.debug(result) //8
}

fn add(x: Int, y: Int) -&gt; Int {
  x + y
}</code></pre>



<p>Run the program and observe the output:</p>



<pre><code>gleam run functions.gleam</code></pre>



<h2>Case expressions</h2>



<p>In Gleam, case expressions offer a concise and expressive way to handle multiple conditions. Here’s a simple example demonstrating how to use case expressions for pattern matching:</p>



<pre><code>import gleam/io
import gleam/int

pub fn main() {
  let x = int.random(5)
  io.debug(x)

  let result = case x {
    // Match specific values
    0 -&gt; "Zero"
    1 -&gt; "One"

    // Match any other value
    _ -&gt; "Other"
  }
  io.debug(result)
}</code></pre>



<p>This code  generates a random integer between 0 and 4 (inclusive) and then uses a case expression to match and print a corresponding message based on the generated value.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>In conclusion, Gleam emerges as a compelling language for developers seeking a balance between the expressiveness of functional programming and the performance of concurrent and distributed systems. Drawing inspiration from Elm and Rust, Gleam’s statically-typed nature ensures robustness and maintainability in software development, while being simple and easy to learn over an afternoon.</p>

<!-- Blog entry follows -->

<p>As DebConf22 was coming to an end, in Kosovo, talking with <em>Eeveelweezel</em> they
invited me to prepare a talk to give for the <a href="https://chipy.org/">Chicago Python User
Group</a>. I replied that I’m not really that much of a Python
guy… But would think about a topic. Two years passed. I meet <em>Eeveelweezel</em>
again for DebConf24 in Busan, South Korea. And the topic came up again. I had
thought of some ideas, but none really pleased me. Again, I do write some Python
when needed, and I <em>teach</em> using Python, as it’s the language I find my students
can best cope with. But <em>delivering a talk</em> to ChiPy?</p>

<p>On the other hand, I have long used a very simplistic and limited filesystem
I’ve designed as an implementation project at class:
<a href="https://github.com/unamfi/sistop-2024-2/blob/main/proyectos/1/README.org">FIUnamFS</a>
(for “Facultad de Ingeniería, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México”: the
Engineering Faculty for Mexico’s National University, where I teach. Sorry, the
link is in Spanish — but you will find several implementations of it from the
students 😉). It is a toy filesystem, with as many bad characteristics you can
think of, but easy to specify and implement. It is based on contiguous file
allocation, has no support for sub-directories, and is often limited to the size
of a 1.44MB floppy disk.</p>

<p>As I give this filesystem as a <em>project</em> to my students (and not as a mere
<em>homework</em>), I always ask them to try and provide a good, polished, professional
interface, not just the simplistic menu I often get. And I tell them the best
possible interface would be if they provide support for FIUnamFS transparently,
usable by the user without thinking too much about it. With high probability,
that would mean: Use FUSE.</p>

<p><a href="https://gwolf.org/files/2024-10/python-fuse.png"><img src="https://gwolf.org/files/2024-10/python-fuse.400.png" alt="Python FUSE"></a></p>

<p>But, in the six semesters I’ve used this project (with 30-40 students per
semester group), <em>only one student</em> has bitten the bullet and presented a FUSE
implementation.</p>

<p>Maybe this is because it’s not easy to understand how to build a FUSE-based
filesystem from a high-level language such as Python? Yes, I’ve seen several
implementation examples and even nice web pages (i.e. <a href="https://github.com/libfuse/python-fuse/tree/master/example">the examples shipped with
the<code>python-fuse</code>
module</a> <a href="https://www.stavros.io/posts/python-fuse-filesystem/">Stavros’
passthrough filesystem</a>,
<a href="https://thepythoncorner.com/posts/2017-02-27-writing-a-fuse-filesystem-in-python/">Dave Filesystem based upon, and further explaining,
Stavros’</a>,
and several others) explaining how to provide basic functionality. I found a
<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/matteobertozzi/python-fuse-pycon4">particularly useful presentation by Matteo
Bertozzi</a> presented
~15 years ago at PyCon4… But none of those is IMO followable enough by
itself. Also, most of them are <em>very</em> old (maybe the world is telling me
something that I refuse to understand?).</p>

<p>And of course, there isn’t a single interface to work from. In Python only, we
can find
<a href="https://github.com/libfuse/python-fuse/tree/master/example">python-fuse</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/nrclark/pyfuse">Pyfuse</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/fusepy/fusepy">Fusepy</a>… Where to start from?</p>

<p>…So I setup to try and help.</p>

<p>Over the past couple of weeks, I have been slowly working on my own version, and
presenting it as a <em>progressive set of tasks</em>, adding filesystem calls, and
being careful to thoroughly document what I write (but… maybe my documentation
ends up <em>obfuscating</em> the intent? I hope not — and, read on, I’ve provided some
remediation).</p>

<p>I registered a GitLab project for <a href="https://gitlab.com/gunnarwolf/fuse_in_python_guide">a hand-holding guide to writing FUSE-based
filesystems in Python</a>. This
is a project where I present several working FUSE filesystem implementations,
some of them RAM-based, some passthrough-based, and I intend to add to this also
filesystems backed on pseudo-block-devices (for implementations such as my
FIUnamFS).</p>

<p>So far, I have added five stepwise pieces, starting from the barest possible
<a href="https://gitlab.com/gunnarwolf/fuse_in_python_guide/-/blob/main/1._emptyfs.py">empty
filesystem</a>,
and adding system calls (and functionality) until (so far) either a <a href="https://gitlab.com/gunnarwolf/fuse_in_python_guide/-/blob/main/4._basic_stat_info.py">read-write
filesystem in RAM with basic<code>stat()</code>
support</a>
or a <a href="https://gitlab.com/gunnarwolf/fuse_in_python_guide/-/blob/main/5._read_only_passthrough.py">read-only passthrough
filesystem</a>.</p>

<p>I think providing fun or useful examples is also a good way to get students to
use what I’m teaching, so I’ve added some ideas I’ve had: <a href="https://gitlab.com/gunnarwolf/fuse_in_python_guide/-/blob/main/useful/dnsfs.py">DNS
Filesystem</a>,
<a href="https://gitlab.com/gunnarwolf/fuse_in_python_guide/-/blob/main/useful/markdown_compiling_fs.py">on-the-fly markdown compiling
filesystem</a>,
<a href="https://gitlab.com/gunnarwolf/fuse_in_python_guide/-/blob/main/useful/unzipfs.py">unzip
filesystem</a>
and <a href="https://gitlab.com/gunnarwolf/fuse_in_python_guide/-/blob/main/useful/uncommentfs.py">uncomment
filesystem</a>.</p>

<p>They all provide something that could be seen as useful, in a way that’s easy to
teach, in just some tens of lines. And, in case my comments/documentation are
too long to read, <code>uncommentfs</code> will happily strip all comments and whitespace
automatically! 😉</p>

<p>So… I will be delivering my talk <a href="https://www.chipy.org/meetings/288/">tomorrow (2024.10.10, 18:30 GMT-6) at
ChiPy</a> (virtually). I am also presenting
this talk virtually at <a href="https://eventol.flisol.org.ar/events/jrsl-2024-santa-fe/">Jornadas Regionales de Software
Libre</a> in Santa Fe,
Argentina, next week (virtually as well). And also in November, in person, at
<a href="https://nerdear.la/">nerdear.la</a>, that will be held in Mexico City for the
first time.</p>

<p>Of course, I will also share this project with my students in the next couple of
weeks… And hope it manages to lure them into implementing FUSE in Python. At
some point, I shall report!</p>
