<p>Neat! We made the top of Hacker News!</p>
<p><img src="https://clownstrike.lol/crowdmad/hn.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.cscglobal.com/cscglobal/home/">Clown Services Company</a> is a company used by companies like CrowdStrike to submit bogus takedowns and commit cyberbullying.</p>
<p><img src="https://clownstrike.lol/crowdmad/csc-logo-full.webp" alt=""></p>
<p>It seems as though CrowdStrike is not exactly a fan of this site, understandable‚Ä¶ it is a parody site after all‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Don‚Äôt worry though! They will definitely solve all their problems by sending a baseless takedown notice to CloudFlare! (sarcasm)</p>
<p><img src="https://clownstrike.lol/crowdmad/clowdstrike-resp1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Unfortunately for them, I don‚Äôt really care about their feelings, and how upset this site makes them, or how much they cry at night knowing that there are people out in the world making fun of CrowdStrike for causing the worst IT outage in the world (so far!).
Stranding millions of airlines passengers, and causing <em>billions</em> of dollars worth of damage‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Of course, I did not want to piss off CloudFlare either, and I‚Äôm most definitely not trying to put CloudFlare in the middle on this‚Ä¶ so I told CloudFlare that I will take the site off of CloudFlare; however, it is staying on the internet‚Ä¶</p>
<p><img src="https://clownstrike.lol/crowdmad/abuse-resp1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It is unfortunately <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/what-really-does-and-doesnt-work-fair-use-dmca">well known</a> that the DMCA is used by corporate cyberbullies to take down content that they disagree with; but, is otherwise legal. The Counternotice system is also hillariously ineffective. The <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/512/">DMCA</a> requires service providers to ‚Äúact expeditiously to remove or disable access to the infringing material;‚Äù yet, it gives those same ‚Äúservice providers‚Äù <em>14 days</em> to restore access in the event of a counternotice! The DMCA, like much American legislation, is heavily biased towards corporations, instead of the actual, living, breathing, citizens of the country.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs absolutely asinine and I would love absolutely nothing more than to have a lawsuit ‚Äúwin‚Äù against CrowdStrike. That would be absolutely <em>amazing</em> for marketing! Especially given the timing of such events‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Additionally, using the Digital Millenium <em>Copyright</em> Act to attempt to takedown a parody site for <em>Trademark Infringement</em> is absolutely hillarious.</p>
<p>There are several ways that <em>anyone</em> is allowed to use a trademark belonging to ‚Äúothers.‚Äù This is considered ‚ÄúFair Use.‚Äù Fair Use is an important aspect of trademark and copyright law. It is a right to use trademarks and copyrighted works for parody, criticism, transformative works, news reporting / journalism, education, etc. Corporate cyberbullies don‚Äôt like that anyone else has rights. Again, I don‚Äôt care, because the only thing that matters is the law, and what a court thinks about it.</p>
<p><strong>Luckily‚Ä¶</strong> Parody is a well recognized ‚Äúright‚Äù for ‚Äúfair use‚Äù</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="ltr"><p>Hi all,</p><p>Starting September 1, Austin Clements will be taking over as the tech lead of Go: both the Go team at Google and the overall Go project. Austin is currently the tech lead for what we sometimes call the ‚ÄúGo core‚Äù, which encompasses compiler toolchain, runtime, and releases. Cherry Mui will be stepping up to lead those areas. </p><p>I am not leaving the Go project, but I think the time is right for a change.</p><p>It‚Äôs important to remember that tech lead‚Äîlike any position of leadership‚Äîis a service role, not an honorary title. I have been leading the Go project for over 12 years, serving all of you, and trying to create the right conditions for all of you to do your best work. Large projects like Go absolutely benefit from stable leadership, but they can also benefit from leadership changes. New leaders bring new strengths and fresh perspectives. For Go, I think 12+ years of one leader is enough stability; it‚Äôs time for someone new to serve in this role. In particular, I don‚Äôt believe that the ‚ÄúBDFL‚Äù (benevolent dictator for life) model is healthy for a person or a project. It doesn‚Äôt create space for new leaders. It‚Äôs a single point of failure. It doesn‚Äôt give the project room to grow. I think Python benefited greatly from Guido stepping down in 2018 and letting other people lead, and I‚Äôve had in the back of my mind for many years that we should have a Go leadership change eventually. </p><p>If you haven‚Äôt worked on the compiler toolchain or runtime, you may not know Austin or Cherry well. Austin has been working on Go at Google since 2014, Cherry since 2016. Their judgment is superb and their knowledge of Go and the systems it runs on both broad and deep. When I have general design questions or need to better understand details of the compiler, linker, or runtime, I turn to them. I‚Äôm very excited that we have such great new leaders available for this change. I have full confidence in Austin and Cherry stepping up, as well as in Roland Shoemaker continuing to lead Go security and Rob Findley and Hana Kim continuing to lead Go tools and IDE support.</p><p>I am going to consciously step back from decision making and create space for Austin and the others to step forward, but I am not disappearing. I will still be available to talk about Go designs, review CLs, answer obscure history questions, and generally help and support you all in whatever way I can. I will still file issues and send CLs from time to time, I have been working on a few potential new standard libraries, I will still advocate for Go across the industry, and I will be speaking about Go at GoLab in Italy in November.</p><p>I will be shifting my focus to work more on <a href="https://go.dev/s/oscar" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en-US&amp;q=https://go.dev/s/oscar&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1722634203969000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1H045asWQfKOgIGaqYQI8A">Gaby and Oscar</a>, trying to make useful contributions in the Go issue tracker to help all of you work more productively. I am hopeful that work on Oscar will uncover ways to help open source maintainers that will be adopted by other projects, just like some of Go‚Äôs best ideas have been adopted by other projects. At the highest level, my goals for Oscar are to build something useful, learn something new, and chart a path for other projects. These are the same broad goals I‚Äôve always had for our work on Go, so in that sense Oscar feels like a natural continuation.</p><p>I am incredibly proud of the work we have all accomplished together, and I am confident in the leaders both on the Go team at Google and in the Go community. You are all doing remarkable work, and I know you will continue to do that.</p><p>The exact details of this transition are yet to be decided. Part of the point of this mail is to ensure that we can discuss those details publicly. Austin and I are both committed to making the change seem like a non-event except for the Go project becoming stronger and better. Again, I‚Äôm not leaving Go and will still be around and participating as an individual contributor.</p><p>Please always feel free to continue to reach out whenever you need anything. And my thanks and congratulations to Austin and Cherry for stepping into their new roles.</p></div></div>]]></description>

	<li paraeid="{5e42ce3a-aa2f-4079-8bb4-91f2cca9c4a6}{154}" paraid="870065390">The activity is financially motivated and delivers exclusively remote access trojans (RATs).&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	<li paraeid="{1e2799d2-7b02-4d39-8feb-88fa0b2fb13c}{185}" paraid="230331499">Since initial observation, the threat activity set behind the campaigns has modified tactics, techniques, and procedures in attempts to bypass detection and improve efficacy.&nbsp;</li>
	<li paraeid="{5e42ce3a-aa2f-4079-8bb4-91f2cca9c4a6}{170}" paraid="6549620">Proofpoint does not attribute this activity to a tracked TA, but research is ongoing.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h3 aria-level="3" paraeid="{5e42ce3a-aa2f-4079-8bb4-91f2cca9c4a6}{176}" paraid="849584846" role="heading">Overview&nbsp;</h3>

<p paraeid="{5e42ce3a-aa2f-4079-8bb4-91f2cca9c4a6}{182}" paraid="878739094">Proofpoint is tracking a cluster of cybercriminal threat activity leveraging Cloudflare Tunnels to deliver malware. Specifically, the activity abuses the TryCloudflare feature that allows an attacker to create a one-time tunnel without creating an account. Tunnels are a way to remotely access data and resources that are not on the local network, like using a virtual private network (VPN) or secure shell (SSH) protocol.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{5e42ce3a-aa2f-4079-8bb4-91f2cca9c4a6}{204}" paraid="1961165670">First observed in February 2024, the cluster increased activity in May through July, with most campaigns leading to Xworm, a remote access trojan (RAT), in recent months.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{5e42ce3a-aa2f-4079-8bb4-91f2cca9c4a6}{216}" paraid="281045025">In most campaigns, messages contain a URL or attachment leading to an internet shortcut (.URL) file. When executed, it establishes a connection to an external file share, typically via WebDAV, to download an LNK or VBS file. When executed, the LNK/VBS executes a BAT or CMD file that downloads a Python installer package and a series of Python scripts leading to malware installation. In some cases, file staging leverages the <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">search-ms</a> protocol handler to retrieve the LNK from a WebDAV share. Typically in campaigns, a benign PDF is displayed to the user to appear legitimate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{fb2b37cb-4ab7-4cdc-8589-2dbf0fc2438a}{2}" paraid="1037406766">In June and July, nearly all observed campaigns delivered Xworm, but previous campaigns also delivered AsyncRAT, VenomRAT, GuLoader, and Remcos. Some campaigns will lead to multiple different malware payloads, with each unique Python script leading to the installation of a different malware.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{fb2b37cb-4ab7-4cdc-8589-2dbf0fc2438a}{2}" paraid="1037406766"><img alt="Malware observed in related campaigns leveraging ‚Äútrycloudflare‚Äù tunnels.&nbsp;&nbsp;" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="f3a3c810-f10a-4baf-903e-25d54e40ad68" height="687" src="https://www.proofpoint.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/Screenshot%202024-07-25%20at%2011.56.08%E2%80%AFAM_0.png" width="929" loading="lazy"></p>

<p paraeid="{fb2b37cb-4ab7-4cdc-8589-2dbf0fc2438a}{65}" paraid="1402929524">Campaign message volumes range from hundreds to tens of thousands of messages impacting dozens to thousands of organizations globally. In addition to English, researchers observed French, Spanish, and German language lures. Xworm, AsyncRAT, and VenomRAT campaigns are often higher volume than campaigns delivering Remcos or GuLoader. Lure themes vary, but typically include business-relevant topics like invoices, document requests, package deliveries, and taxes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{fb2b37cb-4ab7-4cdc-8589-2dbf0fc2438a}{99}" paraid="568078709">While the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) of the campaigns remain consistent, the threat actor does appear to modify different parts of the attack chain to increase sophistication and defense evasion. For example, initial campaigns used little to no obfuscation in their helper scripts. The scripts often included detailed comments about the functionality of the code. However, this changed in June when the threat actors began to incorporate obfuscation in their code.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{075d3b73-fa59-4703-85d9-8bc797230492}{160}" paraid="194595228">Researchers observed another campaign leveraging Cloudflare tunnels to distribute AsyncRAT and Xworm on 11 July 2024. This campaign included over 1,500 messages targeting organizations in finance, manufacturing, technology and others.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{a70f6812-0e32-4519-95a8-29922581265b}{29}" paraid="344042252">Based on the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) observed in campaigns, Proofpoint assesses they can be attributed to one cluster of related activity. Researchers have not attributed a specific threat actor to this activity, but research is ongoing. &nbsp;</p>

<h3 paraeid="{a70f6812-0e32-4519-95a8-29922581265b}{29}" paraid="344042252">Why it matters&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>

<p paraeid="{a70f6812-0e32-4519-95a8-29922581265b}{43}" paraid="1838028986">The use of Cloudflare tunnels provide the threat actors a way to use temporary infrastructure to scale their operations providing flexibility to build and take down instances in a timely manner. This makes it harder for defenders and traditional security measures such as relying on static blocklists. Temporary Cloudflare instances allow attackers a low-cost method to stage attacks with helper scripts, with limited exposure for detection and takedown efforts.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{a70f6812-0e32-4519-95a8-29922581265b}{79}" paraid="1849682704">Attackers‚Äô use of Python scripts for malware delivery is notable. Packaging Python libraries and an executable installer alongside the Python scripts ensures the malware can be downloaded and run on hosts that did not previously have Python installed. Organizations should restrict the use of Python if it is not required for individuals‚Äô job functions. This is not the first-time researchers have observed software packages delivered alongside malware files. In recent months Proofpoint has observed campaigns delivering Java-based malware that bundle a JAR and the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) inside a ZIP to ensure the correct software is installed before executing the downloader or dropper.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{a70f6812-0e32-4519-95a8-29922581265b}{151}" paraid="579202293">The attack chain requires significant victim interaction in order to detonate the final payload, including clicking on the malicious link, double clicking on multiple files such as the LNK or VBS files, and unzipping compressed scripts. This gives the recipient multiple opportunities to identify suspicious activity and disrupt the attack chain before successful execution.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{a70f6812-0e32-4519-95a8-29922581265b}{171}" paraid="331722508">Threat actors are increasingly using WebDAV and Server Message Block (SMB) for payload staging and delivery as the cybercriminal ecosystem continues to experiment with different TTPs. Organizations should restrict access to external file sharing services to only known, safelisted servers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Hundred Rabbits</b> is a small artist collective. Together, we explore the planned failability of modern technology at the bounds of the hyper-connected world. We research and test low-tech solutions and document our findings with the hope of building a more resilient future.</p>

<p>We live and work aboard a ship called <a href="https://100r.co/site/pino.html">Pino</a>. Sailing around the Pacific Ocean made us realize how fragile the modern computing stack was. Living in remote uninhabited parts of the world has offered us a playground to learn how technology degrades beyond the shores of the western world.</p>

<p>Over the years we have received the occasional request for internship, while we appreciate the interest, our small operating budget, erratic work schedule, and intermittent internet connection makes this too difficult. </p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/about/rabbits.polaroid.jpg" title="the rabbits" alt="A dithered scan of two polaroid photos taken by our friend Brady featuring the rabbits rek and dev, both wearing very comfy sweaters" loading="lazy">

<h2 id="story"><a href="https://100r.co/site/story.html">story</a></h2><p>Back in 2016, when first operating on a sailboat, we experienced frequent failures with both software &amp; hardware, largely due to our small <a href="https://100r.co/site/energy.html">energy</a> storage and lack of reliable connectivity. The solution was to create tools that would be better suited to the limits of our new situation. The objective was to replace the bloated, closed-source or subscription software that we were using to do creative work, such as Photoshop, Xcode and Ableton. We were somewhat familiar with web technologies, so we decided to build our programs on this new up and coming framework called Electron.</p>

<p>While solving some of our issues, Electron was rapidly increasing in size and despite it being open-source, soon joined the rest of the software that we wanted to do away with. Our focus shifted toward reducing our energy use, and to ensure reliability we began removing dependencies.</p>

<p>To transition toward our new goals, we developed offline web versions as temporary stand-ins while researching ways to build more resilient software. We eventually ported our tools to C, but while we had achieved ideal energy usage, portability was still an issue, so we kept looking. We learnt <a href="https://100r.co/site/6502_assembly.html">6502 Assembly</a>, seeing players run our games as NES roms on all these different platforms gave us an idea.</p>

<p>In 2021, we began designing a small virtual machine with a focus on implementability; meaning that moving forward, the applications themselves will no longer need to be ported. Instead, to make any one program available on a new platform, the emulator would be the only code needing to be modified, which is explicitly designed to be easily implemented.</p>

<p>This is where we are now. <a href="https://100r.co/site/uxn.html">Uxn</a> may solve our cross-platform issues, while being extremely light. It took us a long while to get here, we hope that one day the Uxn versions of our software replace the desktop and web versions [16.05.21].</p>

<h2 id="why_a_boat"><a href="https://100r.co/site/why_a_boat.html">why a boat</a></h2><img src="https://100r.co/media/content/about/pino_03.png" loading="lazy">

<p>From 2012 to 2014, we lived in Japan. Rek was working in an animation studio, and Devine, in a software company. On weekends and evenings, we worked on our first two games: <a href="https://100r.co/site/hiversaires.html">Hiversaires</a> &amp; <a href="https://100r.co/site/oquonie.html">Oquonie</a>. Originally from Qu√©bec, we were traveling back and forth between Canada and Japan often. We wanted to exit the wasteful loop of acquiring the necessities of life each time our lives were uprooted.</p>

<p>We had heard of people living on sailboats but neither of us had even stepped foot on one, nevertheless, we soon found ourselves watching the videos of <a href="https://youtu.be/Aub3MkFxpHE">David Wellsford</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkaH_UUH0Ek">Teresa Carey</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkYfFeySHGN4DPrOc9So7PA">Nike Steiger</a>, and became obsessed with the idea. Lack of experience aside, we thought that traveling was a good catalyst for learning new languages, for developing an interest in foreign cultures and ultimately for building empathy, curiosity, and creativity.</p>

<p>In January 2016, we left the cold of Montr√©al and moved west to British Columbia, where we purchased <a href="https://100r.co/site/pino.html">Pino</a>. Our curiosity soon led us to make our first trip out to sea, which <i>escalated</i> into a circumnavigation of the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>Our life at sea changed how we work, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW32yUEymvU&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">how we think</a>. We've always made art, and always will, but now we are working on ways to keep doing that sustainably, which translates to making lean and open software that are backward-compatible.</p>

<q>A boat, for all its complexity, is in fact a version of simplicity, but of a satisfyingly complex kind. - Adam Nicolson</q>


<h2 id="where"><a href="https://100r.co/site/where.html">where</a></h2>


<p>Since 2016, Pino has travelled <b>22,466.3 nautical miles</b>.</p>

<p>From 2016-2020 we circumnavigated the Pacific Ocean. We sailed from <a href="https://100r.co/site/western_canada.html">Western Canada</a> to the <a href="https://100r.co/site/us_west_coast.html">US West coast</a>, <a href="https://100r.co/site/mexico.html">Mexico</a>, <a href="https://100r.co/site/french_polynesia.html">French Polynesia</a>, <a href="https://100r.co/site/cook_islands.html">Cook Islands</a>, <a href="https://100r.co/site/niue.html">Niue</a>, <a href="https://100r.co/site/tonga.html">Tonga</a>, <a href="https://100r.co/site/new_zealand.html">New Zealand</a>, <a href="https://100r.co/site/fiji.html">Fiji</a>, The <a href="https://100r.co/site/marshall_islands.html">Marshall Islands</a>, <a href="https://100r.co/site/japan.html">Japan</a> and then back to Western Canada.</p>

<p>From 2020-2023 Pino has explored the Salish Sea, to see where we have been see <a href="https://100r.co/site/western_canada.html">Western Canada</a>.</p>

<p>In 2024, Pino explored the North Coast of British Columbia, and <a href="https://100r.co/site/us_se_alaska.html">US SE Alaska</a>.</p>

<h2 id="setup"><a href="https://100r.co/site/setup.html">setup</a></h2><p>We carry many devices onboard, some for everyday tasks, while others are reserved for low-power situations.</p>

<p>In 2016, we moved aboard Pino with two MacbookPro 2012s. One of them died in Mexico in late 2016 (see <a href="https://100r.co/site/tools_ecosystem.html">tools ecosystem</a> for details). A friend gave us a used MacbookPro 17", but it was too power-hungy for the boat, and it later died in 2020 during our passage from Japan to Canada across the <a href="https://100r.co/site/north_pacific_ocean.html">North Pacific Ocean</a>(a giant jar of umeshu exploded over it).</p>

<p>Most of our computers are secondhand, donated to the studio between 2017 and now. We'd like to thank the following people: <a href="https://twitter.com/thisismyclone" target="_blank">Josh Auget</a> for the x250Thinkpad, <a href="https://twitter.com/johneternal" target="_blank">John Eternal</a> for the MacbookPro 13" 2010, <a href="https://nnnnnnnn.co/" target="_blank">Brian Crabtree</a> for the Pinebook, and <a href="https://lloydwilliams.co/" target="_blank">Lloyd Williams</a> for the MacbookAir 2013 11".</p>

<p><b>Main work stations:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>Rek: Macbook Air 2013 running <a href="https://manjaro.org/download/#i3" target="_blank">Manjaro</a><br><i>2023.11.18.  Uppercase replacement to fix broken keyboard</i>.</li>
	<li>Dev: x250Thinkpad running <a href="https://manjaro.org/download/#i3" target="_blank">Manjaro</a></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Current issues:</b></p>

<p>In August 2023, the Pinebook(Manjaro) developed a weird keyboard error, making it impossible to input a password to log in, and then it stopped booting. We'll try to fix it later when in port. The MacbookPro 2012 also stopped booting, not sure why. We'll test it later when we have access to AC (may be battery related).</p>
<p><b>2023.11.18.</b> The Macbook Pro 2010 has a faulty bottom ram slot. The good news is that both ram modules still work, but we can now only use one(we can upgrade the working one for larger capacity).</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> We are always looking for backup used laptops, if you can help us on that front, let us know at <b>rabbits ‡±∑ 100r ¬∑ co</b>.</p>

<p><b>Other work stations:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>MacbookPro 2010 running <a href="https://manjaro.org/download/#i3" target="_blank">Manjaro</a> <br><i>(changed battery, for the third time, bit too power demanding to use at anchor)</i></li>
	<li>ChromeBook running ChromeOS<br><i>(working, low-power, but doesn't permit the use of Uxn tools, can barely run Gimp)</i></li>

<h2 id="documenting"><a href="https://100r.co/site/documenting.html">documenting</a></h2>
<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/about/wiki.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p><b>Wiki</b>. In April 2021, this website was converted into a wiki. This type of website is a kind of archive and mirror of everything that we have done, and that we have learnt. It's a living document that outlines where we've been, and a tool that advises where we could go.</p>

<p>Rek is the steward of this wiki, and authors most of its write-ups and articles(unless stated otherwise). Devine proofreads Rek's writing, and appends to the documentation of our projects regularly. You can download a copy of the entire website content and sources as a <a href="https://github.com/hundredrabbits/100r.co/archive/refs/heads/main.zip" target="_blank">.zip</a>.</p>

<p>In all that is shared on the many pages populating this wiki, we reserve the right to be wrong, and to change our minds. We are always learning, and deepening our view and understanding of any one thing.</p>

<p><b>Videos</b>. Between 2016 and 2020, we filmed our travels. We filmed regularly, but kept many experiences to ourselves, wishing to be present during worthwhile moments instead of hiding behind a lens. At the end of each month, we would watch our footage and write a summary of that month's events. We planned the monthly <a href="https://100r.co/site/videos.html">videos</a> ahead, and we would gather footage based on what we needed. While one was busy recording the narration, the other would write music. We had our respective tasks when it came time to edit, but both of us took part in the filming.</p>

<p>In rough weather, we prioritize our own safety above all, and so we rarely had footage of rough seas.</p>

<p>What we use to film and edit our <a href="https://100r.co/site/videos.html">videos</a>:</p>

You'll have a fully-functional development environment within hours (fully automated) and be pushing commits on your first day. Deployments to production happen multiple times per day and finish in less than 2 minutes. Effectively all of our codebase is written in Python, Rust, SQL, Javascript/TypeScript, and Nix. The core technologies you'll need familiarity with to be productive are Python, PostgreSQL, Linux, and Git.</p><p>We operate at a larger scale than typical startups. We operate two datacenters with high performance servers we've built that are capable of dealing with the volumes of data we process. We've implemented our own distributed file system. We do full-scale web crawls. We download and perform static analysis on the entire universe of Android APKs and iOS IPAs that are published. Unlike a typical startup where you'll spend half of your time in meetings, and the other half fixing bugs from Jira tickets‚Äî at MixRank you'll get to challenge yourself with difficult technical problems that will help you to grow as an individual.</p><p>We're hiring continuously for the positions below‚Äî they aren't singular positions that will close once filled. Our philosophy on hiring is that the candidate is more important than the position. For each new member of the team, we design a custom role and responsibilities that are specialized to their interests. Other companies will come up with a long list of specific requirements for a position with the expectation that you'll exactly replace someone from the team, or that you'll be the perfect tetris piece that satisfies the job requirements decided by a committee. MixRank is more pragmatic: we'll first get excited about having a unique individual on the team, then we'll figure out the best way to accommodate their specific talents.</p><p>--</p><p>Junior Software Engineer - Remote (Global), Full-Time</p><p>We're looking for remote junior engineers that have 0-3 years of professional experience in software, and 5+ years of curiosity exploring computers, programming, and technical hobby projects.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

    <div data-article-body="">

        

      

      <p>In the fall of 1985, Scott L. Gardner found himself standing over his toilet bowl, fishing around in the squishy output of his empty bowels with a chopstick.</p>

<p>He had recently returned to graduate school in New Mexico from a three-month expedition to Bolivia, where he was studying parasites in wild mammals. His field site near the city of Trinidad had been sparse: portable microscopes, preserved specimens, and a local pig that oinked as it waddled between the tents.</p>

<p>Gardner felt healthy, but he decided to check himself for parasites, as one looks for ticks after a hike. He put a sample of his own feces on a microscope slide and peered through the glass. Immediately, he was shocked: Hidden within the sample were clusters of tiny, light-yellow eggs.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm used to looking at that with regular animals,‚Äù says Gardner. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm not a regular animal‚ÄîI‚Äôm me!‚Äù</p>

<p>Gardner went to the student health center to get treated, microscope slide in tow. Sure enough, the doctor confirmed he had contracted <em>Ascaris</em>, a pencil-thin parasitic worm affecting around one billion people today, most of them in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. Gardner was prescribed an antiparasitic pill, and the next morning, he pooped out his intestines‚Äô inhabitant‚Äîall 12 inches of it.</p>

<p>Driven by curiosity, Gardner probed around in the toilet until ‚Äúout came this noodle on a chopstick.‚Äù He dumped the specimen in a jar and brought it to work, disgusting and fascinating his colleagues.</p>

<p>Today, nearly 40 years later, Gardner is surrounded by noodles in jars at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln‚Äôs Manter Laboratory of Parasitology, where he has served as curator for three decades. Housed in a few modest rooms adjacent to a botanical collection and the floor‚Äôs only bathroom, the laboratory is the world‚Äôs largest university collection of parasites.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou can compare us to a library,‚Äù says G√°bor Racz, the Manter Lab‚Äôs collections manager. Each week, he catalogs and ships out specimens hailing from the Nebraska sandhills, the Caribbean islands or Mongolia‚Äôs grasslands, helping biologists around the world access parasites for research.</p>

<p>Racz and Gardner oversee around 170,000 cataloged vials, microscope slides and jars of creepy crawlies. But each item doesn‚Äôt contain just one specimen. Many parasites are so small or, in the case of worms, so jumbled up that it‚Äôs impossible to count them individually. A single vial can hold thousands of creatures, bringing the true collection closer to 17 million. Donations from researchers have made the number of slides and vials double every decade.</p>

</figure>
<p>Aside from a rotating cast of graduate students, the Manter Lab only receives enough funding to employ the two men. Besides, few biologists have the necessary training to manage a collection that encompasses all types of parasites. It‚Äôs like ‚Äúasking someone to do mammals and <a href="https://ocean.si.edu/ocean-life/invertebrates/echinoderms">echinoderms</a>,‚Äù says Gardner. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how far apart [the types of parasites] are.‚Äù</p>

<p>Gardner, 67, typically sports thick aviator glasses with a bright blue strap and various parasite-adorned T-shirts. Each year, when he teaches parasitology to a room full of University of Nebraska undergraduates, he begins with his chopstick horror story. His students groan, giggle and gag.</p>

<p>Gardner‚Äôs task‚Äîto pique young scientists‚Äô interest in his field‚Äîis a daunting one. Parasites‚Äô horrible reputation precedes them. For some, like <em>Plasmodium </em>(which causes malaria) and <em>Leishmania</em> (which causes <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/leishmaniasis">leishmaniasis</a>), their reputation is justified due to their devastating impacts on human health. Malaria <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/php/impact/index.html#:~:text=Key%20points,population%20at%20risk%20for%20infection.">kills more than 600,000 people a year</a>, and leishmaniasis <a href="https://www3.paho.org/hq/dmdocuments/2017/2017-cha-leishmaniasis-factsheet-work.pdf">kills around 30,000</a>.</p>

<p>But parasites are also diverse and understudied creatures that have evolved to flourish in nearly every animal and ecosystem on Earth. They <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534706001522">keep ecosystems in balance</a>, providing a natural control on host species while stimulating their co-evolution over many generations. For example, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27373339/">one group of the mussel <em>Mytilus edulis</em> evolved</a> to tolerate infection from the small, parasitic crustacean <em>Mytilicola intestinalis</em> in the southeastern North Sea, while another group grew to resist it. This could cause the mussel to diverge into different species over time.</p>

<p>Parasites also change host species‚Äô behavior, leading to oddities like the pop-culture-worthy <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/the-real-zombie-fungus-that-inspired-hbos-the-last-of-us-180981514/">zombie ants that mysteriously climb ten inches</a> up plants, permanently lock their jaws into the plant, and allow their parasitic fungus (<em>Ophiocordyceps unilateralis</em>) to grow out of their body and rain spores onto unsuspecting ants below. And parasites keep food webs miraculously complex, forming hundreds of connections among themselves, other parasites and host species. Often, in an effort to travel between host animals, parasites will expose their hosts to new predators, like the tapeworm<em> Ligula intestinalis</em>, which<em> </em>grows so large it changes the buoyancy of the fish it inhabits, causing the fish to swim closer to the surface and get eaten by birds.</p>

<p>Parasitism, a relationship between two species where one benefits at the other‚Äôs expense, has<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27436119/"> </a><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27436119/">evolved independently over 220 times in animals</a>‚Äîmore than any other animal lifestyle. Nearly half of all animals are parasites, with conservative estimates at 3.5 million species. Like the mammals, birds, insects and fish all around us, each parasite serves important functions in its environment‚Äîones that, without the parasite, could spell <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5222570/#:~:text=While%20many%20uncertainties%20exist%2C%20the,%2C%20communities%2C%20and%20even%20ecosystems.">widespread ecological change</a>, if not disaster. For example, a widely supported idea called the <a href="http://www.sbs.utexas.edu/levin/bio213/articles/nature.pdf">‚Äúenemy release hypothesis‚Äù</a> suggests that as parasites of invasive plants and animals decrease, the spread and abundance of the invasive species increase.</p>

<p>As Gardner, Racz and their colleague Judy Diamond wrote in their 2021 book <em>Parasites: The Inside Scoop</em>, ‚ÄúGetting rid of all parasites would not make the world a healthier place.‚Äù</p>

<p>Just as the fascinating and ecologically vital roles of parasites are coming to light, researchers realize many are in trouble. With warming temperatures and deforestation threatening biodiversity around the globe, the parasites on and inside other animals will soon feel the effects. <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1602422">As many as a third</a> of parasites may be endangered.</p>

<p>Simultaneously, parasitology is confronting a loss within its own field. According to data provided by the American Society of Parasitologists, in 1973, its membership had grown to nearly 1,900 members from its modest start at 320 nearly 50 years earlier. As of its 100th anniversary this year, the society has dropped by 76 percent, with just around 450 members.</p>

<p>The reason for the drop is two-pronged: Older parasitologists are retiring or passing away, while few new researchers are entering the field.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI started off in this [field] pretty young and I got to know all these people, and they‚Äôre all expiring,‚Äù says Gardner. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so sad. But what can you do, right?‚Äù</p>

<p>Gardner and his colleagues are trying to entice the next generation to study parasite biodiversity. They are sneaking parasites into their college biology curriculums when traditional textbooks leave them out. They are handing out parasite stuffed animals to children at museum events to make the creatures seem cuddlier. And they are running the world‚Äôs first ever parasite conservation program for a tiny tick so that conservation organizations will see parasites as creatures worthy of protection.</p>

<p>As the field shrinks around them, parasitologists hope to give their discipline a boost, ensuring that researchers will continue to study the overlooked creatures that call other animals home.</p>

<hr>
<p>Scientists often call parasites the ‚Äúdark matter‚Äù of the animal world: They‚Äôre unseen but incredibly important.</p>

<p>They‚Äôre also wildly diverse. Parasites can have segmented bodies, hard outer shells, many tiny legs, suckers, hooks, antennae, bristles or flagella; or they can be a single, tiny cell.</p>

<p>Parasites are unique in that they are ‚Äúnot linked by a shared ancestry but by a shared lifestyle,‚Äù explains Mackenzie Kwak, a parasite ecologist at Japan‚Äôs Hokkaido University. Think of it like herbivores: Cows and human vegetarians both avoid eating meat, but they‚Äôre not part of the same family or genus. Animals, plants, fungi and protozoa can all be parasites.</p>

<p>What defines a parasite is its reliance on a host species to get energy‚Äînot to mention free shelter and transportation. Parasitism is far from easy living; hundreds of millions of years of evolution have prodded parasites to find and manipulate other animals, just as those animals have evolved their own unique methods of survival.</p>

<p>Parasites are ‚Äúalmost like Pok√©mon,‚Äù says Carrie Cizauskas, a freelance science consultant with a background in disease ecology. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre like these weird little alien creatures that you can be like, ‚ÄòOoh, this one has these capabilities and this kind of power.‚Äô‚Äù</p>

<p>Parasites are everywhere. Most animals host at least one species, with the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK214895/">average</a> mammalian host harboring eight. In some ecosystems, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature06970">the total mass of parasites is larger than the total mass of predators</a>, despite parasites‚Äô often microscopic size.</p>

<p>In fact, biologists can use the presence of parasites as an indication of an ecosystem‚Äôs health: The more parasite species an environment has, the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature15374">more biodiverse</a> it is, and therefore more resilient in the face of disturbances and threats.</p>

<p>Research also increasingly suggests that parasites play an essential, regulatory role in complex ecological networks. Their functions can be compared to top predators, like wolves or lions: Parasites keep populations in check so host species don‚Äôt outpace available resources, like food or prime habitat. Sometimes, parasites can indirectly alter the interactions between other animals. <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.0700062104">New England snails infected with a wormy parasite eat less algae</a> than their uninfected counterparts, leaving more algae for other animals to munch on.</p>

<p>Parasites are particularly important in food webs. In one <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2685421/">study on a California salt marsh</a> published in the journal <em>Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B</em>, removing a single snail species decreased the food web‚Äôs stability by around 1,000 links between species. It‚Äôs not that the snail was itself so important, but that its removal caused the secondary extinction of 17 different species of parasitic flatworms. In turn, since the parasites moved between so many host animals during their complex life cycles, the food web lost those connections. For example, one of the most common worms in the marsh, <em>Euhaplorchis californiensis</em>, causes its California killfish host to <a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2307/2265536">shimmy and jerk around</a> so it gets eaten more often by birds‚Äîmeaning that the parasite‚Äôs removal also diminished the birds‚Äô food source.</p>

<p>Globally, <a href="https://chelsealwood.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Carlson-et-al.-2020-1.pdf">at most 4 percent of parasite worm species infect humans</a>, though multiple parasitologists shared in interviews that the true estimate for all parasites is closer to 0.1 percent. Understandably, however, our perceptions of parasites are far from favorable.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe way most people [in the U.S.] encounter them is in their dog‚Äôs [poop],‚Äù says Chelsea Wood, a parasitologist at the University of Washington. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not really a thing that‚Äôs going to endear itself to you at first blush.‚Äù</p>

<p>Teachers and parents know the nightmare of lice, hikers are no strangers to ticks, and public health officials are on guard for <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/giardia/causes/index.html">giardia</a> or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/08/well/family/how-worried-should-cat-owners-be-about-toxoplasmosis.html">toxoplasmosis</a>. But causing human suffering is far from parasites‚Äô whole story.</p>

<p>As the wide-ranging ecological effects of parasites come more clearly into view, many scientists hope our perception of them will change, too: from fear to wonderment.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt might seem unimaginable that 40 years into the future, we‚Äôre all going to look at parasites and be like, ‚ÄòOh, so beautiful, so magnificent,‚Äô‚Äù says Wood. ‚ÄúBut I do think that‚Äôs what‚Äôs coming.‚Äù</p>

<p>Human parasitic infections in the Western world are far less prevalent today than at any point in history. Access to clean water is likely the biggest reason: <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/the-dirty-secrets-about-our-hands-role-in-disease-transmission-180983919/">Washing your hands</a> and food are the first steps to parasite prevention. When people do get infected, antiparasitic drugs, surgical procedures or sometimes a change in diet can take care of the parasite. Gardner mused on how his longtime colleague, renowned parasitologist Robin Overstreet, was once sad that a meal of particularly spicy curry had caused him to poop out a parasite with which he had intentionally infected himself to show his students.</p>

<p>As parasite infections have decreased, so has parasite education. Medical schools often no longer mandate parasitology classes, with such courses falling into small concentrations like tropical medicine or infectious disease. Undergraduate biology programs do not require parasitology, and high school courses are practically nonexistent, according to Kwak, Wood and others. They say only veterinarians are still required to learn about parasites.</p>

<p>‚ÄúSomehow, we‚Äôre giving people full-on degrees in biology when they don‚Äôt know anything about a plurality of animal life,‚Äù Wood says.</p>

<p>A lack of parasite education leads many scientists to stumble into the field by accident. Wood, who originally wanted to be a marine biologist, was no exception. When her college didn‚Äôt have any marine biology labs, Wood wound up working with parasitic worms at a nearby university. The experience changed her career trajectory entirely.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI realized that there was this whole sub-world, this whole alternate dimension that was present in nature and in all the animals that I had been interested in since I was little,‚Äù Wood says. ‚ÄúIt was sort of like waking up from the Matrix.‚Äù</p>

<p>Others, like Chenhua Li, a parasitologist who now works in biotechnology, had never even heard of parasitology before her graduate studies in the field. ‚ÄúEnglish is not my native language,‚Äù Li explains of researching Western graduate programs while living in China. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt recognize ‚Äòparasitology‚Äô as a word, but it started with a ‚ÄòP-A‚Äô and ended with ‚Äòology,‚Äô so I mistook that word as ‚Äòpathology.‚Äô‚Äù</p>

<p>Li ended up loving parasites and pursuing a PhD.</p>

<p>If budding biologists don‚Äôt get a chance to learn about parasitology, established ones, too, aren‚Äôt always considering parasites in their research.</p>

<p>Utah State University ecologist Sara Weinstein worries that ecologists exclude parasites from studies where they might play crucial roles, since they‚Äôre often hidden inside more visible species. Cizauskas says they are bothered by how members of the biology community tend to read literature only about a particular specialty, remaining unexposed to other fields, including parasitology. They think that parasitology should not be an isolated discipline, since the organisms are, by definition, members of other biological systems.</p>

<p>Many parasitologists see a plainer reason that their creatures aren‚Äôt widely studied: They‚Äôre not cute. Since humans evolved to care for our young, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3596402/">research</a> suggests we‚Äôre drawn to infantile features in other animals, like big eyes, round cheeks and stubby limbs. There‚Äôs even a German word for it: <em>Kindchenschema</em>, which literally translates to ‚Äúbaby schema.‚Äù</p>

<p>Unfortunately for parasites, says Kwak, they‚Äôre ‚Äúnot nearly as charismatic‚Äù as polar bears or puppies. And, he emphasizes, parasites aren‚Äôt simply unsightly‚Äîthey‚Äôre often invisible. Some can only be seen with a microscope, and many make their livings inside other creatures.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt see a tapeworm walking down the street,‚Äù says Sarah Orlofske, a parasitologist at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point. ‚ÄúMost students have seen a bird, maybe they‚Äôve seen a lizard, maybe they‚Äôve seen a snake. But unless you‚Äôre, like, really keen on mosquitoes and ticks, most students don‚Äôt interact.‚Äù</p>

<p>If you can‚Äôt see the parasites, Orlofske continues, you ‚Äúdon‚Äôt relate to them‚Äù‚Äîand won‚Äôt study them. In her career, she has mentored over 80 biology undergraduates; only two of them initially came to her wanting to study parasites.</p>

<p>For many parasitology instructors, a partial solution could lie in changing biology curriculums to introduce parasites earlier. If high school students learned about parasites in introductory biology, they mused, students would be more likely to study them in college. Even at universities, however, biology textbooks largely leave out parasites; <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006320710004751?via=ihub">a 2011 study</a> published in <em>Biological Conservation</em> found that 72 percent of English language conservation biology textbooks did not mention parasites or portrayed them negatively.</p>

<p>Some parasitologists aren‚Äôt waiting for curriculums to change. Orlofske has a ‚Äúparasite of the day‚Äù in her college introductory biology class, and Gardner can‚Äôt help but incorporate his favorite worms into college zoology. Much of the time, says Gardner, professors will recruit future parasitologists by pulling aside their top students to suggest that they join their labs.</p>

<p>Kwak thinks parasitology could take inspiration from disciplines like entomology, which have amateur societies that naturally recruit people to careers studying insects. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt just take a butterfly net out and catch ticks,‚Äù he acknowledges, but plenty of hands-on parasite activities are available for participants willing to get a bit messy. Some of his favorites include tick flagging (sweeping a cloth sheet attached to a pole along vegetation to gather ticks), scooping leeches out of ponds with nets, and dissecting fresh fish to find and identify their wormy inhabitants.</p>

<p>Orlofske keeps realistic expectations about peddling parasitology. ‚ÄúI think the future of parasitology, if it‚Äôs not convincing people completely to go to the dark side and call themselves parasitologists, is to make career-oriented professionals in other fields more parasite-minded,‚Äù she says.</p>

<p><br>
If other disciplines pay attention to parasites, she thinks, the threats the creatures pose and face will worm their way to light.</p>

<hr>
<p>For one world-renowned parasitologist, studying worms followed him into retirement. When Mike Kinsella graduated in 1969 with a PhD in parasitology from the University of Montana, he struggled to find a faculty position where he could discover new species of parasitic worms. He ended up back in school for pharmacology, then worked as a pharmacist for two decades to pay the bills. Upon retiring, Kinsella realized his love for worms hadn‚Äôt faded.</p>

<p>For the past 30 years, Kinsella has been a stay-at-home parasitologist, identifying species for zoos, wildlife biologists and fellow parasitologists from the comfort of his home desk in Missoula, Montana. Every week, he opens his mailbox to find packages of worms from different countries and host animals. Then he gets to work with two modest microscopes and volumes of parasite reference books. In total, Kinsella has described over 30 new species, published more than 200 papers, and had 20 species named after him.</p>

<p>Kinsella runs his personal parasitology lab, which he calls HelmWest‚ÄîHelm for the helminth worms he studies, and west for its residence in Montana‚Äîall out of pocket. He washes and reuses slides 200 times and asks colleagues to send him chemicals when he can‚Äôt purchase his own. His wife, ever supportive, only ‚Äúdraws the line at dissecting things in the living room,‚Äù Kinsella says, acknowledging that she‚Äôll sometimes let small mammals slide.</p>

<p>Despite this bare-bones set up, Kinsella is one of the world‚Äôs leading experts on nematodes, of which an estimated half a million species exist. He‚Äôs also 83.</p>

<p>Since parasite varieties are so numerous, parasitologists like Kinsella are sometimes the only expert on a specific group. When these scientists die, their intricate understanding of how to classify and connect species goes with them. ‚ÄúWhen I‚Äôm gone, I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs anybody left that can do what I do,‚Äù Kinsella says.</p>

<p>A<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0020751922000534?via=ihub"> 2022 study</a> published in the <em>International Journal for Parasitology</em> found that for the past two decades, a small handful of productive scientists have found and described most new parasite species. These individuals are mostly in the later stages of their careers, with little turnover to younger scientists‚Äîa fact that, according to the authors, is ‚Äúputting the whole field at risk of collapse.‚Äù</p>

<p>At the American Society of Parasitologists‚Äô 100th anniversary meeting in June, the attendance was bimodal: a mix of older or retired scientists and college- and graduate school-age biology students brought by their professors. The gap in early career scientists was palpable, says Orlofske, who herself brought three students.</p>

<p>Indeed, the society‚Äôs membership data reflects the same: In the <a href="https://bioone.org/journals/journal-of-parasitology/volume-109/issue-6/23-76/Big-Science-at-Small-Institutions--Parasitology-Research-at-Primarily/10.1645/23-76.short">2023 presidential address</a>, parasitologist Tamara J. Cook reported that only 44 percent of members were active scientists in America; the rest were students, retirees or international members. Of the American scientists, over a third work at primarily undergraduate institutions, where <a href="https://digitalrepository.trincoll.edu/facpub/154/">financial support for research is much lower than at larger universities</a>.</p>

<p>Importantly, this gap isn‚Äôt the case for the subfield of disease ecology, which concerns itself more with parasites‚Äô ecological roles rather than their identities. Unlike taxonomy, which Kwak, himself a taxonomist, describes as ‚Äúdusty and traditional,‚Äù disease ecology is booming in America in the wake of public interest in diseases like Covid-19 and Zika. Orlofske sees the field growing out of a natural instinct to protect ourselves, our pets and our livestock, while the funding for taxonomy ‚Äújust has evaporated.‚Äù</p>

<p>As tenure-track ecology positions and conferences increase, the work of discovering, naming, connecting and cataloging parasites is petering out.</p>

<p>Tyler Achatz, a parasitologist at Middle Georgia State University, echoed his colleagues‚Äô concern. As an early career scientist, Achatz, who described 25 new parasite species during his PhD, has watched the community of parasitologists he can consult dwindle around him. He worries young biologists like himself aren‚Äôt learning the necessary skills to identify and describe new parasite species.</p>

<p>‚ÄúUnless people step up and start filling that gap, the knowledge is going to get lost,‚Äù he says.</p>

<p>Gardner, who has described around 50 new parasite species in his career‚Äîand has had three named after him‚Äîestimates that the Manter Lab‚Äôs collection holds thousands of new but un-described species, a number that would be astonishing in fields like mammalogy or ornithology.</p>

<p>And that number keeps increasing. Many parasitologists have spent their careers amassing private collections from their fieldwork, bequeathing them to the Manter Lab upon their deaths. Gardner and Racz have received donations of as many as 40,000 specimens at one time.</p>

<p>The Manter Lab mirrors a global trend. <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2020.1841">A 2020 paper</a> estimated that, at current rates, cataloging every species of helminth would take 745 years‚Äîand that doesn‚Äôt even touch the numerous other kinds of parasites.</p>

<p>‚ÄúG√°bor and I are trying to do the best we can, but there‚Äôs no way to actually do it,‚Äù says Gardner, who estimates that the work of maintaining the growing collection would be best suited to ten people. ‚ÄúThe task is daunting, and time is short.‚Äù</p>

<hr>
<p>On a slushy winter afternoon, Racz stepped out onto the fourth floor of the University of Nebraska State Museum to a warm greeting from a white-haired museum employee. She was sitting down after a day of classroom museum visits but was eager to tell Racz about a child‚Äôs response to a parasite exhibition that he and Gardner designed.</p>

<p>‚ÄúSomeone asked what the giant snakeskin was,‚Äù she recounted, referring to a 100-foot-long plastic tapeworm suspended from the ceiling. ‚ÄúAnd I said, ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs a parasite from a whale.‚Äô And he said, ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs a parasite?‚Äô‚Äù</p>

<p>This question is precisely what visitors are supposed to ask‚Äîand learn the answer to.</p>

<p>Pull-out drawers of taxidermy host animals, a simple microscope with an oversized wheel of specimens, and a ten-foot touchscreen table for interactive games round out the parasite exhibit. On one wall, snug in a jar, sits Gardner‚Äôs chopstick-scooped <em>Ascaris</em>.</p>

<p>The goal is simple: to show the public that parasites are more fascinating than fearsome. With children, specifically, parasite outreach will hopefully ‚Äúspark some folks‚Äô imaginations about career paths that are not dolphin training, but instead learning about what‚Äôs inside of dolphins,‚Äù says Wood of the University of Washington.</p>

<p>Around the country, parasitologists are adopting the tactic of creating colorful and interactive parasite activities and materials. At the University of Georgia, a program called EcoReach sends scientists to classrooms and science fairs to teach about ecology topics including parasitology. At the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point, Orlofske runs an event where kids comb out glitter from stuffed animals‚Äô fur to mimic ticks.</p>

<p>Wood is publishing a children‚Äôs book in fall 2024 called <em>Power to the Parasites!</em> Cizauskas, who is also an illustrator, is designing a parasite coloring book featuring scientific explanations of the creatures on each page. Li sells packs of Pok√©mon-esque cards highlighting parasites with unique qualities. One notable card describes <em>Toxoplasma gondii</em>, a parasitic protozoan that boasts ‚ÄúMind Control,‚Äù because it attracts its rodent host to the smell of cat urine, where the rat spreads the parasite to felines. Another card features <em>Leucochloridium paradoxum</em>, a flatworm touting ‚ÄúMimicry‚Äù by pulsating rapidly inside snails to attract birds searching for worms.</p>

<p>‚ÄúNot only dinosaurs are cool,‚Äù says Li, who also commissions monthly parasite comics and has created a<a href="https://www.globalpc.org/parasite-personality-quiz"> </a><a href="https://www.globalpc.org/parasite-personality-quiz">parasite personality quiz</a> taken by 5,000 people.</p>

<p>Still others, like science illustrator Mona Luo, want to capture public interest by subverting people‚Äôs parasite expectations. Her goal is to make the creatures ‚Äúso beautiful that people don‚Äôt have time to think about how disgusted they are.‚Äù</p>

<p>Luo is known among parasitologists for her pun-filled<a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/twistedwingpress"> </a><a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/twistedwingpress">parasite Valentine‚Äôs Day cards</a> and was personally asked to design the logo for the 100th anniversary meeting of the American Society of Parasitologists.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThere is a lot of value in trying to cut these negative associations people have,‚Äù says Supraja Rajagopal, the coordinator of EcoReach, about parasites. They hope EcoReach can ‚Äúget that idea in kids‚Äô heads when they‚Äôre younger that this isn‚Äôt bad, this thing isn‚Äôt gross, or icky.‚Äù</p>

<p>The Manter Lab also dabbles in parasite paraphernalia. By Racz‚Äôs desk sits a cardboard box of parasite stuffed animals featuring cartoonish lice, ticks and the protozoan that causes Chagas disease. They‚Äôre leftover from outreach events at the University of Nebraska State Museum, and Gardner tosses extras to students who answer questions correctly in class.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI think you can cuddle up to tapeworms, too,‚Äù says Gardner.</p>

<hr>
<p>Sparking children‚Äôs and students‚Äô interest in parasites are two fronts in the quest to revitalize parasitology. But their effects won‚Äôt be felt for decades, if and when some of those people grow up to be scientists.</p>

<div><p>That‚Äôs a problem given the more immediate threats facing parasitology: climate change and habitat loss.</p><p>

‚ÄúParasites face a double threat,‚Äù wrote Kwak, Wood and colleagues in<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006320719319937"> </a><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006320719319937">2020 in the journal </a><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006320719319937"><em>Biological Conservation</em></a>. ‚ÄúThey are directly vulnerable to extinction due to anthropogenic factors like climate change or invasive species, and indirectly vulnerable through coextinction.‚Äù</p></div>

<p>Many parasite extinctions will be silent, since we don‚Äôt know what creatures live in endangered hosts to begin with. Out of the millions of parasite species, only two have been assessed for the Red List, an inventory of threatened species maintained by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).</p>

<p>Kwak, who serves as the co-chair of the IUCN‚Äôs Parasite Specialist Group, is on a mission to put parasites on ecologists‚Äô radars with the first parasite conservation program. He studies the Ryukyu rabbit tick, <em>Haemaphysalis pentalagi</em>, which lives exclusively on a dark-furred rabbit species inhabiting Japan‚Äôs lush Amami Oshima and Tokunoshima islands. By learning about the endangered rabbit‚Äôs needs, as well as breeding captive populations of the rabbit and its tick, they will conserve both.</p>

<p>Kwak says it‚Äôs ‚Äútwo for the price of one conservation.‚Äù If successful, his study will show that parasite conservation is easy and cheap: Just don‚Äôt remove parasites from a host species you‚Äôre already saving. For the amount of money spent to save one or two large mammals, says Kwak, you could save ‚Äúa thousand [parasite] species, many of which probably have much more significant value to ecosystems.‚Äù</p>

<p>Extinction isn‚Äôt in store for every parasite species;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5755797/"> </a><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5755797/">some may thrive in a warmer world</a>. This can be a major public health concern, as warmer, wetter regions‚Äîperfect habitats for mosquitoes and ticks‚Äîexpand into previously cooler ranges. Changing climates may also alter the behavior of host animals, making them more suited to contracting or transmitting parasites.</p>

<p>With diverse hosts, life cycles and habitats, predicting the future of parasites is messy, if not impossible. But Wood sees existing evidence suggesting that climate change and habitat loss will harm far more species than they help. ‚ÄúParasites might be among the most imperiled species on the planet, which cuts against most people‚Äôs understanding of what parasites are and where they‚Äôre going,‚Äù says Wood.</p>

<p>Parasitologists are in an accelerating race: to catalog the world‚Äôs parasite biodiversity faster than parasites‚Äîand their own community‚Äîdisappear. This situation is called the taxonomic impediment.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre obliterating biological diversity on the Earth as fast as we can,‚Äù says Gardner. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs not enough people who will take those [species] and describe them and understand what they are before they‚Äôre gone.‚Äù</p>

<p>Scientists often argue for studying biodiversity because we don‚Äôt know what any species might reveal, be it the missing puzzle piece to an evolutionary question or a new ingredient for a lifesaving drug. With parasites, we could learn which threatened species are keeping ecosystems ever-so-gently in balance, or which ones might be future human-killers.</p>

<p>We also might not. Still, some dedicated scientists are committing their lives to ticks and worms simply because they like them‚Äîand because they hope others, in time, might like parasites, too.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThere‚Äôs so much biodiversity everywhere, you know, right under [our] feet, even in the city, even in [our] own bodies, potentially,‚Äù says Cizauskas. ‚ÄúAnd that stuff is just as important as, say, a panda.‚Äù</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-5453">

<div>
<p><span>It has been brought to my attention that I have never actually written this story down before, merely told it in person to many students for valuable lessons and also for laughs over cocktails. It is a litany of bad ideas from several people that all came together at once to reach out and zap me.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>DISCLAIMER FOR THE SQUEAMISH:</strong> My eyes and vision are fine. There was some slight retinal bleaching in the peripheral vision of my right eye. If I hold up a large plane of white paper in front of me, like when helping a friend make posters for Ren Faire, there‚Äôs a small patch of yellowish tint in the lower right corner. Not a big deal, but damage is damage.</span></p>
<p><span><em>[Scene ‚Äì A very overcast morning in the spring of 1999. Exterior driveway between Building 6 &amp; 15 of $LASER_COMPANY, roughly 10am]</em></span></p>
<p><span>It was a day much like any other in my four years, five months and eighteen days of working there, not that I was counting or anything. After checking on a couple laser labs and talking to people, I needed to go across the way to visit the optics coating facility. So, I walked out the side door of Building 6 to cross the driveway, go down the stairs and over to the loading dock of Building 15. As I was walking across the driveway, I heard a weird noise. Something was rhythmically clicking away a bit faster than once a second. My thought process went a bit like this.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>Me: What is that noise?</span><br>
<span>Me [a few seconds later]: Ohhhhh, I know that noise. That‚Äôs the flashlamps of a Quanta-Ray system going off.</span><br>
<span>Me [immediately after, spinning on my heels to head toward the source of the sound]: Why am I hearing this outside?</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>It was at some point while walking that way and waving my hands and yelling ‚ÄúSHUT IT DOWN!!!‚Äù that I took my laser hit from a scattered, fractional beam from the shenanigans going on (I didn‚Äôt notice the damage from the hit until several months later). I am going to try to describe what I saw in enough detail that hopefully you can reconstruct the scene in your head, because I don‚Äôt want to use my non-existent art skill in Paint to draw this.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_5454" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5454"><a href="https://www.funraniumlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Qaunta-Ray.jpg"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.funraniumlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Qaunta-Ray.jpg" alt="" width="226" height="300"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5454"><span>Quanta Ray PRO350 with frequency doubling, emitting a 532nm beam ‚Äì Sales brochure image from Quanta Ray, unknown date</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><span>The back of&nbsp; Building 6 had their shipping and receiving area and the rear parking lot. In the parking spaces closest to the shipping &amp; receiving area, several spaces had been taken up by a Quanta-Ray‚Äôs power supply, a Rubbermaid cart with a large Quanta-Ray laser balanced on it, and it was connected to some Caltrans utility trailer looking contraption downstream and in line with the output aperture of the laser. Beyond the contraption trailer was a VP of Sales‚Äô brand new cherry red Jeep Grand Cherokee. There were umbilicals for chilled water and power running across the parking lot back into the loading dock. Three men are standing behind the laser with another rolling cart being used as moveable workbench, fiddling with the controls for the laser and the contraption it was connected to on the trailer. Two of them were wearing laser safety eyewear. The third, one of our sales engineers who is named Bob, was not wearing any.</span></p>
<p><span>After making sure everything was shut down, I assessed the scene and realized something had gone wrong beyond simply ‚Äúthis entire situation‚Äù. This was a sales demo for prospective customers gone horribly awry. I identified myself as the Laser Safety Officer and that I had some questions. The customers looked very much like they wanted to be anywhere but here.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>Me: May I see your glasses?</span><br>
<span>[Customers 1 &amp; 2 hand me them]</span><br>
<span>Me: These are argon filters. Are these your glasses at you brought with you?</span><br>
<span>Customer 1: Yes.</span><br>
<span>Me: Shame you‚Äôre working with a Nd:YAG laser, not an argon one.</span><br>
<span>Customer 2: Better than nothing, right?</span><br>
<span>Me: These are utterly useless at 1064nm. You both should go make appointments with your ophthalmologists. But at least you understood that you need gogs. Bob, where are yours?</span><br>
<span>Bob: In the lab.</span><br>
<span>Me: Would that be the lab that this laser was in before you wheeled it outside?</span><br>
<span>Bob: Yes.</span><br>
<span>Me: Bob, why is this laser outside? What are you even doing here?</span><br>
<span>Customer 1: You see, we had an idea‚Ä¶</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>I want to say that, on first blush, their idea was admirable. They were trying to come up with a less destructive way to remove striping from roadways. You have to grind that stuff off, which damages the road surface, leading to increased wear &amp; tear and thus potholes. Their solution was to do it with a laser instead.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>Me: Let me see if I understand this right. You want to mount a high power laser on a cart, towed by a Caltrans or contractor truck, to burn the striping off roads?</span><br>
<span>Customer 1: Yes, ingenious isn‚Äôt it?</span><br>
<span>Me: The striping with <strong>REFLECTIVE</strong> paint?</span><br>
<span>Customer 2 [looks with concern at Customer 1]: Umm.</span><br>
<span>Me: I‚Äôm sure you can find a way with enough power.</span><br>
<span>Customer 1: But look, it worked!</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>The customer motioned for me to look at the parking lot space stripe that a whole bunch of of round spots on it which had, indeed, burnt the paint off the asphalt.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>Me: Bob, $FACILITIES_GUY is going to kill you. He&nbsp;<em>just</em> repaved and striped this parking lot a couple of weeks ago.</span><br>
<span>Bob: [looks morose, as he‚Äôs starting to get an inkling of how bad this looks]</span><br>
<span>Me: But you‚Äôve been having some trouble, haven‚Äôt you?</span><br>
<span>Customer 1 [surprised]: Yes! We can‚Äôt get beam no matter what we do.</span><br>
<span>Me: That‚Äôs because you‚Äôve blown the coating on one of your steering optics.</span><br>
<span>Customer 1 &amp; 2: How do you know?</span><br>
<span>Me: Because your beam is not being steered to raster the stripe on the ground. Instead, it‚Äôs been firing a flat beam forward and doing a raster scan of [gestures] that Grand Cherokee.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>Bob and Customer 1 &amp; 2 looked up to see the stripe of exposed metal on the door of the VP of Sales‚Äô car where the paint had been burnt away. On closer inspection, we later leaned that the Quanta-Ray had burnt through the wheel well and cut the brake line. At this point, I decided I want to really rub in what a terrible idea all this was to them. How they had failed on so many levels.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>Me: That‚Äôs $VP_of_Sales‚Äô car, isn‚Äôt it Bob?</span><br>
<span>Bob: [groans] Yes.</span><br>
<span>Me: Pretty sure that‚Äôs your boss, Bob.</span><br>
<span>Bob: Yeah.</span><br>
<span>Me: When did you start doing this?</span><br>
<span>Customer 1: Around 8am.</span><br>
<span>Me: And when did you start having problems?</span><br>
<span>Customer 1: 8:30ish, maybe?</span><br>
<span>Me: Ah, so you were lasing through break time. Bob, what‚Äôs behind the car?</span><br>
<span>Bob: Building 15.</span><br>
<span>Me: $VP_of_Sales doesn‚Äôt normally get here until after 9am and the roach coach always pulls up at the loading dock of Building 15 at 8:45. So, hopefully you were aiming above eye level for all the employees on break. Also, that exposed brushed steel on the Cherokee is a mirror for near-infrared, so you‚Äôve been shining that beam right back at yourselves. You <em>definitely</em> should call your ophthalmologists. But what‚Äôs behind you, Bob?</span><br>
<span>Bob: The fence.</span><br>
<span>Me: What kind of fence is it?</span><br>
<span>Bob: Chain-link.</span><br>
<span>Me: So, not a solid fence then. What‚Äôs on the other side of the fence, Bob?</span><br>
<span>Bob: [now staring at the ground in shame] The elementary school.</span><br>
<span>Me: If you‚Äôre very lucky, recess happened before your optic failed but we‚Äôre still gonna have to send a letter to the school about a potential exposure. Of course, that brushed steel mirror isn‚Äôt flat, which means your reflections went all over. Bob, what‚Äôs above us?</span><br>
<span>Bob: [picking up where I was going] Planes.</span><br>
<span>Me: How many airports worth of airspace travels over us?</span><br>
<span>Bob: SFO, Oakland, San Jose, the tiny municipal ones.</span><br>
<span>Me: You forgot a really important one. Our neighbor, Moffett fucking Field. Firing a laser into military airspace is an act of war. Are you declaring war on the United States, Bob?</span><br>
<span>Bob: [stands silently]</span><br>
<span>Me: Bob, what else is above us?</span><br>
<span>Bob: [looks up] Clouds.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>Because timing is the essence of comedy, that would be when it started to rain on the quarter million dollar laser system, destroying it. Bob no longer worked at $LASER_COMPANY two weeks later.</span></p>
<p><strong>MORAL: </strong>Of all the bystanders you could injure, DO NOT HURT THE SAFETY PERSON.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="incArticle"><h2>"When AI is mentioned, it tends to lower emotional trust, which in turn decreases purchase intentions."</h2><h2>Trough Luck</h2><p>Researchers have found that including the words "artificial intelligence" in product marketing is a major turn-off for consumers, suggesting a growing backlash and disillusionment with the tech ‚Äî and that startups trying to cram "AI" into their product are actually making a grave error.</p><p>As detailed in a <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19368623.2024.2368040">new study</a> published in the <em>Journal of Hospitality Marketing &amp; Management</em>, researchers presented 1,000 respondents with questions and descriptions of products. Surprisingly ‚Äî or <a href="https://futurism.com/google-ai-ad-sad">perhaps not</a>, depending on <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/ai-adding-work-study">your perspective</a> ‚Äî they found that products described as using AI were consistently less popular.</p><p>"When AI is mentioned, it tends to lower emotional trust, which in turn decreases purchase intentions," said lead author and Washington State University clinical assistant profess of marketing Mesut Cicek in a <a href="https://news.wsu.edu/press-release/2024/07/30/using-the-term-artificial-intelligence-in-product-descriptions-reduces-purchase-intentions/">statement</a>. "We found emotional trust plays a critical role in how consumers perceive AI-powered products."</p><h2>Strong Pass</h2><p>In an experiment, the researchers found that a group of participants were far less likely to purchase a smart television when its description included the words "artificial intelligence." A separate group was far <em>more</em> likely to buy it when the words were omitted from an otherwise identical description.</p><p>For "high-risk" purchases such as expensive electronics or medical devices, the effect was even more pronounced, with Cicek suggesting that consumers are more wary of monetary loss or danger to physical safety.</p><p>"We tested the effect across eight different product and service categories, and the results were all the same: it‚Äôs a disadvantage to include those kinds of terms in the product descriptions," Cicek said.</p><p>That kind of growing mistrust is symptomatic of a much larger trend.
