<p>We are in the third golden age of AI.</p>
<p>In the previous two golden ages (1950s-1960s and the 1980s),
our expectations outpaced the capabilities of the technology at the time, leading to disappointment.
In contrast, the AI technology of the current golden age, which began in the mid-2010s, has consistently exceeded our expectations.</p>
<p>Among AI technologies, the Transformer, introduced in 2017, stands as a groundbreaking breakthrough.
Initially developed as a machine translation model, its impact has extended to permeate nearly every field.
Today, the Transformer model is considered essential knowledge for modern engineers.</p>
<p>The first goal of this document is to provide the shortest path for engineers to understand the Transformer.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>Peter Buxtun, the whistleblower who revealed that the US government allowed hundreds of Black men in rural <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/alabama" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Alabama</a> to go untreated for syphilis in what became known as the Tuskegee study, has died. He was 86.</p><p>Buxtun died on 18 May of Alzheimer’s disease in Rocklin, California, according to his attorney, Minna Fernan.</p><p>Buxtun is revered as a hero to public health scholars and ethicists for his role in bringing to light the most notorious medical research scandal in US history. Documents that Buxtun provided to the Associated Press, and its subsequent investigation and reporting, led to a public outcry that ended the study in 1972.</p><p>Forty years earlier, in 1932, federal scientists began studying 400 Black men in Tuskegee, Alabama, who were infected with syphilis. When antibiotics became available in the 1940s that could treat the disease, federal health officials ordered that the drugs be withheld. The study became an observation of how the disease ravaged the body over time.</p><p>In the mid-1960s, Buxtun was a federal public health employee working in San Francisco when he overheard a co-worker talking about the study. The research was not exactly a secret – about a dozen medical journal articles about it had been published in the previous 20 years. But hardly anyone had raised any concerns about how the experiment was being conducted.</p><p>“This study was completely accepted by the American medical community,” said Ted Pestorius of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, speaking at a 2022 program marking the 50th anniversary of the end of the study.</p><p>Buxtun had a different reaction. After learning more about the study, he raised ethical concerns in a 1966 letter to officials at the CDC. In 1967, he was summoned to a meeting in Atlanta, where he was chewed out by agency officials for what they deemed to be impertinence. Repeatedly, agency leaders rejected his complaints and his call for the men in Tuskegee to be treated.</p><p>He left the US Public Health Service and attended law school, but the study ate at him. In 1972, he provided documents about the research to Edith Lederer, an AP reporter he had met in San Francisco. Lederer passed the documents to the AP investigative reporter Jean Heller, telling her colleague: “I think there might be something here.”</p><p>Heller’s story was published on 25 July 1972, leading to congressional hearings, a class-action lawsuit that resulted in a $10m settlement and the study’s termination about four months later. In 1997, President Bill Clinton formally apologized for the study, calling it “shameful”.</p><p>The leader of a group dedicated to the memory of the study participants said on Monday they were grateful to Buxtun for exposing the experiment.</p><p>“We are thankful for his honesty and his courage,” said Lille Tyson Head, whose father was in the study.</p><p>Buxtun was born in Prague in 1937. His father was Jewish, and his family immigrated to the US in 1939 from Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia, eventually settling in Irish Bend, Oregon, on the Columbia River.</p><p>In his complaints to federal health officials, he drew comparisons between the Tuskegee study and medical experiments Nazi doctors had conducted on Jews and other prisoners. Federal scientists did not believe they were guilty of the same kind of moral and ethical sins, but after the Tuskegee study was exposed, the government put in place new rules about how it conducts medical research. Today, the study is often blamed for the unwillingness of some African Americans to participate in medical research.</p><p>“Peter’s life experiences led him to immediately identify the study as morally indefensible and to seek justice in the form of treatment for the men. Ultimately, he could not relent,” said the CDC’s Pestorius.</p><p>Buxtun attended the University of Oregon, served in the US army as a combat medic and psychiatric social worker and joined the federal health service in 1965.</p><p>Buxtun went on to write, give presentations and win awards for his involvement in the Tuskegee study. A global traveler, he collected and sold antiques, especially military weapons and swords and gambling equipment from California’s gold rush era.</p><p>He also spent more than 20 years trying to recover his family’s properties confiscated by the Nazis and was partly successful.</p><p>“Peter was wise, witty, classy and unceasingly generous,” said David M Golden, a close friend of Buxtun’s for over 25 years. “He was a staunch advocate for personal freedoms and spoke often against prohibition, whether it be drugs, prostitution or firearms.”</p><p>Another longtime friend Angie Bailie said she attended many of Buxtun’s presentations about Tuskegee.</p><p>“Peter never ended a single talk without fighting back tears,” she said</p><p>Buxtun himself could be self-effacing about his actions, saying he did not anticipate the vitriolic reaction of some health officials when he started questioning the study’s ethics.</p><p>At a Johns Hopkins University forum in 2018, Buxtun was asked where he got the moral strength to blow the whistle.</p><p>“It wasn’t strength,” he said. “It was stupidity.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

  <h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>I bought a Surface Pro 4 at 2016. It has an Intel Core m3-6Y30 CPU and 4GB memory. The spec is not that impressive even compared to an average laptop released years earlier. On the other hand, the form factor is very attractive to me: at a very low price, you get a tablet with a beautiful HiDPI 2k screen, a pressure sensitive stylus and an useable keyboard. It is on the heavier side if used as a tablet, but compared to other laptops, it’s very light. It served me very well for my limited use cases. The blog <a href="https://www.binwang.me/2016-11-28-Config-Development-Environment-on-Windows.html">Build a Unix Like Environment on Windows</a> was written at that era. Some years later, I bought a more powerful laptop when I needed to work while traveling. So I gave the Surface away to a family member.</p>

<p>However, during the past years, I couldn’t stop thinking about having a Linux tablet. At first I checked <a href="https://pine64.org/devices/pinetab/">Pinetab</a>, then I realized I had a Surface which would be perfect if I could install Linux on it. I searched online and found some successful stories. So when I <a href="https://www.binwang.me/2024-03-19-Travel-Back-to-China.html">travelled back to my hometown</a> at the beginning of this year, I brought the Surface back with me and started to experiment with it.</p>

<h2 id="use-cases">Use Cases</h2>

<p>Before I go further, I need to mention my intended use cases:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Browse Internet. Mainly <a href="https://www.rssbrain.com/">RSS Brain</a>, the RSS reader I built by myself.</li>
  <li>Media consumption: watch videos from my Samba share and online websites like Youtube.</li>
  <li>PDF reading: reading only is enough for me but it’s better if I can take notes in the PDF.</li>
  <li>Sketches: I don’t have a habit to do handwriting notes even at students era. Nowadays it’s more efficient and readable/searchable to take text notes with Markdown. However, I do like drawing sketches on paper when brain storming or resolving some hard problem. Moving it to digital has a lot of benefits if it works.</li>
  <li>Drawing: this is a good to have feature. I don’t really have needs to draw things but it’s always fun. Especially with the development of AI, if I draw something and send it to a more powerful machine to generate images, it could open doors to many possibilities.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

<p>The installation of Linux is actually very easy. I tried two distros and the installation process went very smooth for both of them. The distros I tried are <a href="https://endeavouros.com/">EndeavourOS</a> and Fedora workstation 40.</p>

<p>The installation steps are well documented in <a href="https://github.com/linux-surface/linux-surface/wiki/Installation-and-Setup#installation">linux-surface’s wiki</a>. <a href="https://github.com/linux-surface/linux-surface">linux-surface</a> is the Linux kernel and tools for Surface devices. The wiki page has its installation steps as well.</p>

<p>In general, if only used as a laptop, the experience is almost perfect even without the linux-surface kernel. But using it as a tablet is another story.</p>

<h2 id="what-works">What Works</h2>

<p>Let’s talk about what works first. Even without linux-surface kernel, almost everything works except touch screen and stylus. That includes things like wireless network, bluetooth, keyboard, power profile, UI scaling for Hi-DPI and so on. Multi touch and pressure sensitive stylus works as well (sort of, see sections below) after installed linux-surface kernel. Battery life is good enough: about 5-6 hours of light usage like web browsing, PDF reading, and about 3 hours of video watching. (Just some estimated time from my experience, no serious benchmarking was done).</p>

<p>On the software side, automatic screen rotation is enabled on both distros I tried. KDE with EndeavourOS is very fast and responsive. When the keyboard is detached, it enters tablet mode which makes some UI larger and more user friendly with touch gestures. For example, you can just touch on a folder to open it in Dolphin instead of double click it.</p>

<p>For Gnome, it’s less responsive than KDE but the UI is really beautiful when used as a tablet. I was never a fan after Gnome 3 but I guess the UI changes it made makes more sense on a tablet than on a laptop or a desktop. The overall layout really reminds you about the iPad or Android tablet (in a good way), but with the power of a real desktop OS at the same time. I would really like it if it uses less resource.</p>

<p>Even though the overall experience is positive and has the potential to meet all my use cases, one serious problem made it very unusable and made me gave up Linux on Surface at the end.</p>

<h2 id="the-problems-in-both-distros">The Problems in Both Distros</h2>

<p>The deal breaker problem is touch recognition. The problem is in the surface-linux tools so it affects all the distros. The biggest problem is ghost touch: touches are registered randomly even when I do nothing. I tried a lot of workarounds including the ones mentioned in <a href="https://github.com/linux-surface/linux-surface/wiki/Surface-Pro-5">linux-surface’s wiki page</a>, but none of them actually resolved it completely. Sometimes it’s fixed after reboot but reappeared after next reboot. Sometimes it get fixed for a period of time but reappeared after a system upgrade. Sometimes the touch screen doesn’t work at all after resume from sleep. The randomness and the serious of the problem is really annoying so I gave up using it with Linux at last.</p>

<p>Other than the ghost touching, another big problem about touch recognition is palm rejection. It’s really annoying when draw things with the pen. In iptsd (surface-linux’s deamon for touch recognition), there is a configuration to disable touch screen when using a pen but it doesn’t work well. So it makes drawing very unusable.</p>

<p>Both KDE and Gnome has virtual keyboards when the physical keyboard is detached, and works most of the time despite the problems I’ll mention in the following sections. But if you have setup disk encryption with a password, there is no virtual keyboard when you input the disk password, so a physical keyboard is always needed during the boot. Which can be annoying but not really a deal breaker.</p>

<p>The last big problem is battery drain during sleep. It uses about 30% battery for one night even it has been put into sleep. I had similar issues for other laptops. I believe there maybe some configurations I can tune to fix that. But after I gave up Linux on it because of the ghost touch, I didn’t dig deeper into that.</p>

<p>Other than the problems shared by both distros, each distro/desktop environment also has their own problems.</p>

<h2 id="the-problems-in-kde-with-endeavouros">The Problems in KDE with EndeavourOS</h2>

<p>The biggest problem in KDE other than the ones I talked above, is the virtual keyboard. It’s buggy and not very stable. Sometimes it kept pop up and sometimes it doesn’t show up. It’s annoying especially at the login screen: if it’s not popped up you will still need a physical keyboard, which prevent it to be a real tablet. Sometimes when the keyboard is popped up, the panel at the bottom cannot be touched. The bugs happened randomly that makes it hard to be properly reported.</p>

<p>Another problem is the touch gesture for right click. Naturally, with a touch screen, long press should be treated like a right click. But that is not the case for KDE. So a lot of operations just cannot be done without a mouse when you need a right click.</p>

<p>Resize a window is also very tricky with touch only operation: you need to touch on the boarder precisely on the first try.</p>

<p>At last, the scroll behaviour is not very smooth. It makes me a little bit dizzy just by scrolling through web pages and PDFs.</p>

<p>So I thought give another distro and desktop environment a try, to see if they can resolve my problems.</p>

<h2 id="the-problems-in-gnome-with-fedora-workstation-40">The Problems in Gnome with Fedora Workstation 40</h2>

<p>I choose Fedora because it comes with Gnome, and I had good experience with it before. After the installation, the first impression is it’s much slower than KDE with EndeavourOS. I found it enables swap and ZRam by default so I disabled them. It’s better but still slower than KDE. It uses more memory at around 40-50% percentage while idel. And I got a lot of OOM kills which almost never happened with KDE on EndeavourOS.</p>

<p>Maybe because of the slowness, it’s also buggy for lots of operations. For example, when switch to the workspace view from PDF viewer with 4 fingers swipe up, the PDF keeps scrolling at the background. And when scroll in the file manager, the context menu keeps popping up.</p>

<p>Other than the slowness, there is a problem on the virtual keyboard as well: the backspace key doesn’t work properly. I found a workaround by install a third-party Gnome addon, but sometimes the old keyboard still popped up.</p>

<h2 id="go-back-to-windows-10">Go Back to Windows 10</h2>

<p>I’d say if the touch recognition works well enough, all the other problems are acceptable with KDE. But with those problems, I finally decided to fallback to Windows 10 again. It works well enough, just as I remembered from years ago. However I abandoned OneNotes and some other Microsoft products and use the following software instead:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Firefox as the browser.</li>
  <li>Nextcloud to sync the files.</li>
  <li>Samba for video sharing.</li>
  <li>Built in video player for local video playing.</li>
  <li>Krita for drawing and sketches.</li>
  <li>Drawboard PDF for PDF reading.</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s pretty disappointing that this device cannot be used with Linux properly. But using Windows is still better to just let the device sitting there doing nothing. Maybe I will re-evaluate it after Windows 10 is end of life next year.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="article-body" data-attribute="article-content-body" data-component="article-content-body"><p>In a basement on London’s <!-- -->Hatton Garden<!-- -->, a small production team is heating a furnace to 2,000C — a temperature that will obliterate most materials placed within it. Each day, here at precious metals refiner Mastermelt, the furnace is fed a diet of objects collected from jewellers’ workshops — full bags from vacuum cleaners, used wet wipes, blunted sandpaper and even old carpets — in the hope that when the ashes are processed, thousands of pounds’ worth of gold, platinum and more will remain.</p>
<p>“We always tell people, don’t throw anything away,” says Gary Williams, a director at Mastermelt, who the previous week paid out £17,000 to a jeweller who had been casually stockpiling the general detritus a workshop produces. “He’d just been saving all this stuff and didn’t realise what it was worth.” Mastermelt makes its money by taking a commission on the value of the scrap metal refined, as well as charging for processing.</p>
<p>Part of Mr Williams’ job is to educate jewellers on the financial rewards of hoarding every waste-attracting object and sending the haul — known as a sweep — to a refiner to be melted down and the precious metals reclaimed. Most jewellers will be astute enough to collect hard scrap, also known as lemel, which includes filings caught in animal skins hung beneath workbenches for this very reason, or clippings from claws cut to size when setting a diamond in a ring. Once weighed, the value of this scrap can be easily ascertained, and Mastermelt has an app that can be downloaded to give jewellers access to live prices.</p>

<p>But the precious metal they cannot see may bring in surprising amounts of money too. The grinding, filing and buffing required to create jewels by hand or machine send microscopic clouds of precious dust into the air; the dust can land anywhere and be easily transported as it sticks to shoes and clothing. “We went to a workshop in Birmingham and right at the front of the building was a big 4ft sq coconut mat,” says Mr Williams. “Every single person coming in and out of the building walked over that mat, and had been doing so for seven or eight years.</p>
<p>“They didn’t think it was worth anything as it wasn’t in the workshop, but they let me take it away. We swept up the dirt and processed it and it came to quite a few thousand pounds.” Another surprise source was a pair of chair covers from a shop in Hatton Garden which were so choked with platinum dust that Mastermelt paid out £3,000 after processing them.</p>
<p>Mr Williams has a vault of stories about reclamation and its valuable surprises, but most of them are kept inside the trade. “People don’t really like it being talked about as this is their Christmas bonus,” he says. “Whatever money you make from reclamation is cash flow for your business. It’s found money.”</p>
<p>Timing is important in making sure a reclamation is as profitable as possible. First, a jeweller must ensure they have accumulated a large enough sweep to make a profit. Stuart Wibberley, sales director at Cooksongold, another refiner, says processing carries a flat fee of about £300 “whether you have 30 bags or 300”. (Mastermelt says its fees are variable, typically about £4 per kilo processed.) Then there are metal prices: Mr Williams says Mastermelt was “inundated” after the vote for Brexit in June, when the gold price spiked from $1,265 per oz the day before to $1,316 per oz the day after.</p>

<p>Reclaiming precious metal waste has always been a cornerstone of a jewellery workshop’s routine, but the practice has rarely been as sophisticated as it is today. “It really was considered a bonus in the trade,” says Mark Brittain, whose family business, Brittains Marking, creates complex tools for the luxury jewellery industry.</p>
<p>He ran the company, which was founded in 1850, from the 1970s until the early 2000s, when he retired from the jewellery trade. He now operates a commercial property business in Birmingham.</p>
<p>Mr Brittain recalls old-fashioned sweet jars being filled with tiny coils of metal, a byproduct of engraving cufflinks. The owner of one particular London jeweller that Brittains Marking worked with in the 1980s kept all the engraving scraps that were not requested by customers — Mr Brittain says some clients were indeed savvy enough to ask for theirs back — and cashed it in once a year to fund a cruise aboard the QE2 luxury liner.</p>
<p>This was during what some in the trade call “the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2012/apr/02/brief-history-of-brylcreem" data-trackable="link">Brylcreem </a>days”. Jewellery workers were said to slather their hair with that pomade so that they could run their hands, covered in precious metal dust, through it, later retrieving the gold or silver. Mr Brittain has stories of such practices, and Winchester jeweller Jeremy France, whose twice-yearly sweeps at the workshop in his store yield between £6,000 and £8,000 a time, jokingly refers to an industry expression that “we don’t employ people with sweaty hands or turned-up trousers,” both ideal for accumulating valuable dust.</p>
<p>Four flights above the jewellery boutique of <!-- -->David Morris <!-- -->on Bond Street, polisher Dave Wadeson, who has been in the business for 40 years, says he once saw floorboards glittering in a workshop when he was an apprentice.</p>
<p>“When [the workshop] was taken over by Bentley &amp; Skinner, they took up all the floorboards and the amount of lemel embedded in them was incredible — they found piles of fine grain around the edges,” he says.</p>
<p>When Mr Williams worked at wedding ring manufacturer Brown &amp; Newirth, the business moved workshops around 1990 and dismantled its five-storey wooden staircase, which was so impregnated with precious metal that it looked like the “glitter in a marble kitchen top”. It turned out to be worth tens of thousands of pounds — enough to pay for a new staircase and the workshop’s moving costs.</p>
<p>And at Cooksongold, which claims to be the UK’s largest precious metals refiner, processing 25,000 jobs a year, Mr Wibberley recalls when a parquet floor in its own factory was ripped up and the precious metals embedded in the wood made it worth £20 per sq m.</p>
<p>Large jobs like burning floorboards, carpets or benches tend to happen when a jeweller is moving premises or upgrading. There are less extreme options for the interim, such as specialist vacuuming services or sanding down the top layer of benches and processing the wood dust. The challenge is picking up the day-to-day waste, and it is an art that is being constantly refined — particularly by larger manufacturers with the most to gain.</p>
<p>***</p>

<p>New technology being introduced to these factories is actually increasing waste, requiring even greater efforts to capture it. One British jewellery manufacturer, which did not wish to be named, has invested in sealed milling machines fitted with vacuums to capture the coils and swarf (sawdust-like chips of precious metal) they dispatch at high speeds. Each has a filter that can separate materials as thin as a micron — much narrower than a human hair.</p>
<p>In Birmingham’s Jewellery Quarter is Hockley Mint, a British jewellery manufacturer with a turnover of £12m that produces up to 140,000 pieces a year. Gathering scrap and lemel at its 30,000 sq ft factory requires daily cleaning and collecting, as well as the use of localised vacuums. “One of the things we have put in place that is relatively new is that when workers wash their hands we save the paper towels they dry with,” says managing director Gary Wroe.</p>
<p>“We got £2,000 back in a 12-month period just from the towels, and that goes straight on our bottom line.”</p>

<figure data-component="image-set"><picture><source media="(min-width: 700px)" srcset="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A2f6e3480-d991-11e6-944b-e7eb37a6aa8e?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=1 1x,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftcms%3A2f6e3480-d991-11e6-944b-e7eb37a6aa8e?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=2 2x" width="2048" height="1152"><img src="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fcom.ft.imagepublish.upp-prod-eu.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2f6e3480-d991-11e6-944b-e7eb37a6aa8e?source=next-article&amp;fit=scale-down&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=700&amp;dpr=1" alt="Gary Wroe MBA Managing Director of  Hockley Mint, Birmingham" data-image-type="image" width="2048" height="1152" loading="lazy"></picture><figcaption><span>Gary Wroe MBA Managing Director of  Hockley Mint, Birmingham</span><span> <!-- -->© Edward Moss</span></figcaption></figure>

<p>Hockley Mint has also upgraded its windows so that blinds are now encased between panes of glass — their fabric panels were a magnet for precious metal dust — and it also has an on-site laundry to process workers’ clothes.</p>
<p>Its biggest investment in precious metal reclamation to date has been an incinerator, which it installed 18 months ago, to melt, but not process, its sweeps. “If you send a bag of material out, you don’t know what’s coming back,” says Mr Wroe, who adds that the value of precious metals it is collecting has increased since taking over its own incinerating.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>His concern is one shared by many in the industry. Looking at the accumulation of sludge from settlement tanks placed beneath sinks, grimy mop heads and all manner of other dirt and waste collected in a sweep, it is impossible to estimate how much money has accrued, although there are ways to guess.</p>
<p>Jewellers expect to lose metal during the production phase and so will plan for it. At David Morris, the target is a maximum loss of 5 per cent, although its craftsmen believe the working figure is 1 per cent or 2 per cent, providing a guide for what could be reclaimed.</p>

<p>Hockley Mint uses scales to give as accurate a forecast as possible. “We measure in and measure out, and keep records so we know approximately what we should get back,” says Mr Wroe.</p>
<p>For others, guesstimates are based on experience, and this can lead to friction between jeweller and refiner when discrepancies arise. “Some people have expectations based on history but they haven’t got a complete understanding of what’s going on,” says Mr Williams. The gold price might have changed, he suggests, or the weight of material being processed could be similar but the contents disparate. “In this industry, trust is a big factor,” he says.</p>
<p>But that trust goes both ways. Sweeps can take weeks to process and refiners will sometimes advance money based on the expected yield, which can give less scrupulous jewellers an opportunity to run a ruse. “I heard a story about a sweep where the processor took the job, gave the customer an advance based on history and when they looked in the sweep bag, the bottom of it was newspapers,” says Mr Williams. </p>
<p>Cooksongold offers its clients advances at its trade counters in London and Birmingham. The business is part of the German Heimerle + Meule group and much of its refining is done at the group’s plants in Spain and Germany. This adds to the processing time, so it will do a pre-melt in London to ascertain what it is sending to Heimerle + Meule.</p>
<p>Processing its own pre-melted metal would be the next stage in Hockley Mint’s reclamation journey, but it is one that Mr Wroe has yet to commit to. “That’s a different skill and we’d have to bring the expertise in, so we’d have to work out whether it would be worth it.”</p>
<p>While Mr Wroe’s approach to reclamation is far more advanced than many other workshops, he is nonetheless resigned to the fact that he will never catch it all. “We have sticky mats at the doors to get the dust off people’s shoes as they leave the building, otherwise the streets of Hockley would be paved with gold,” he sighs. “And the council should definitely check the sewers.”    </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><pre>KUtrace is an extremely low-overhead Linux kernel tracing facility for observing all 
the execution time on all cores of a multi-core processor, nothing missing, while running 
completely unmodified user programs written in any computer language. It has been used in 
live datacenters (x86 processors) and in real-time autonomous driving (ARM processors) 
to understand long-standing performance mysteries. The design goal of KUtrace is to 
reveal the root cause(s) of unexpected delayed responses in real-time transactions or 
database processing while having such low overhead that it does not distort the system 
under test.

This March 2022 update COMPLETELY REPLACES the previous 2019 repository.

The directory contains files associated with the 2022 book 
Understanding Software Dynamics by Richard L. Sites, ISBN 978-0137589739.

The book-figures directory contains the underlying HTML files for over 100 of
the diagrams in the book, so you can wander around them to see more context or
to discover other performance issues. They work best in the Chrome browser.

The kutrace_user_guide.pdf file gives more detail and is more recent than the 
text in Chapter 19 of the book. Read it to fully use the HTML files.

The hello_world_trace.html file is an example trace of the hello_world_trace.c 
program found in book-user-code.

The book-user-code directory contains all the programs used in the book and the
script to compile them. They compile and run on both x86 and Rpi4 machines.

The linux_patches_installation_guide.pdf gives brief directions for building
the patches.

The loadable-module directory contains the source and Makefile for the companion
kernel module that implements the bulk of KUtrace. It builds for AMD and Intel 
x86 machines and for the Raspberry Pi4-B.

The patches-* files contain original source and patched source pairs of files
for adding KUtrace to three different versions of the Linux operating system.
These files are structured in the matching directories of the original Linux 
source download. The patches-linux-5.10.46-rpi4 folder contains additional 
documentation and useful scripts for building a patched kernel for any of
these three versions or for incorporating the patches into other versions. Only
64-bit versions of Linux are supported in this code; 32-bit ports of KUtrace 
are possible but difficult.

All the code is open sourced, most of it under the BSD three-clause license. The code specific to freebsd uses the BSD2 license, and the code specific to risc-v is licensed under GPL-2.0. The Linux loadable module(s) are required by Linux to be licensed under GPL-2.0.

Such costs are one reason that health care costs keep going up far above the rate of inflation.</p><p><span>Why was there such a big spread between the cost of buying the drug and the price being paid by payers? It wasn’t what most people expected, that the pharmaceutical company Novartis, had found a way to maintain its patents. The answer, according to a </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/07/ftc-releases-interim-staff-report-prescription-drug-middlemen" rel="">new Federal Trade Commission report</a><span>, is that a small group of middlemen were inflating the price. </span></p><p>These middlemen are called pharmacy benefit managers, and what they are supposed to do is clerical work. When a pharmacy dispenses medicine, it sends the claim to a PBM, which bills the insurer and patient and remits the pharmacist money. But because of a legal change I’ll explain, just three PBMs are now in control of pricing of pharmaceuticals, and are redirecting vast amounts of money to themselves. And they are why the price of generic Gleevec didn’t drop as it should have.</p><p><span>In fact, the concerned executive worked at the parent company of one of these PBMs. He was not worried about the price, but that such a price would look bad, and possibly violate the law. “We've created plan designs to aggressively steer customers to home delivery where the drug cost is ~200 times higher,” he wrote. If you went to Costco, he went on to say, the cost was $97, so the plan didn’t recommend patients go there. If a patient went to Walgreens, which the plan did recommend, it was $9000. And if a patient chose home delivery via the PBMs own mail order pharmacy, it was $19,200. “The optics are not good and must be addressed,” he added. He didn’t need to say that the added revenue for PBMs, just for that one drug, was $902.1 million over a few years. Another drug studied by the FTC, one for prostate cancer called Zytiga, was similarly inflated by an extra $685 million. That’s $1.6 billion for the two of them. Think about all the drugs used in our healthcare system, and that will give you a sense of why healthcare costs keep going up. (Yes, each inflated drug cost is </span><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/economic-termites-are-everywhere" rel="">an economic termite</a><span>.)</span></p><p>Most people think of high pharmaceutical prices, and blame the companies you’d expect in Big Pharma. These firms, with storied names like Merck, Pfizer, Novartis, Genentech, etc, are powerful, and they are in the business of developing and selling drugs. But this other group, corporations you haven’t heard of, composed entirely of middlemen, price and handle payment for pharmaceuticals between doctors, pharmacies, and patients, are perhaps equally important, if not more so. And unlike pharmaceutical companies, who actually employ doctors and scientists, PBMs don’t do anything difficult. They keep lists.</p><p><span>PBMs are </span><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/the-red-wedding-for-rural-pharmacies" rel="">a topic</a><span> I’ve covered, mostly as a cause of the disappearance of rural independent pharmacies, but last week, the FTC sparked a big political fight by releasing </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/07/ftc-releases-interim-staff-report-prescription-drug-middlemen" rel="">this report</a><span> on the PBM business model. Chair Lina Khan did so with support from one Republican commissioner, Andrew Ferguson, but opposition from another, Melissa Holyoak. The FTC also indicated in the report’s final pages, and the Wall Street Journal </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/health/pharma/ftc-to-sue-drug-managers-over-insulin-prices-b46af71f?mod=hp_lead_pos4" rel="">noted</a><span>, that it was likely to sue PBMs over the high prices they foster for insulin, which could potentially change the entire drug claims system, and bring down prices dramatically. </span></p><p><span>To understand the world of pharma pricing, we have to start at the beginning. In the 1950s and 1960s, pharmaceutical development exploded, as did the health insurance industry. Insurers needed a way to help their patients to easily buy them the new cornucopia of drugs at pharmacies. Enter pharmacy benefit managers, who were claims processors that issued a plastic card to insurance customers, got pharmacies to accept those cards, and tracked the money flows, including reimbursements. PBMs were very similar to Visa and Mastercard, with the very first PBM actually called “</span><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdvancePCS" rel="">Pharmaceutical Card System</a><span>.”</span></p><p>PBMs soon started to create what are called drug formularies, which are lists of drugs payers will cover, specifying the kind of drugs included and the cost-sharing arrangements. They also put together networks of pharmacies, and began helping design strategies to encourage patients to take the correct medicine for the lowest price, known as utilization management. It was a business to business service. If you’re an employer, a union, a state or Federal government program, and you need drug benefits for a group, you hire a PBM and they set you up with a range of formularies and pharmacy networks. Today, commercial health plans, Medicare drug plans, Medicaid managed care, and affiliated health insurers use PBMs.</p><p><span>But then, several changes shifted the business model. The first was consolidation. From the 1980s to the 2000s, PBMs consolidated both horizontally and vertically, so each big PBM is now owned by a major healthcare conglomerate. CVS owns&nbsp;Caremark, Cigna has Express Scripts and UnitedHealth Group (UHG) runs Optum Rx. (For a case study, see my 2020 piece called “</span><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/how-cvs-became-a-health-care-tyrant" rel="">How CVS Became a Health Care Tyrant</a><span>.”) There were big acquisitions, like Express Scripts buying Medco in 2012 and CVS buying Aetna in 2018, but smaller ones as well. “According to PitchBook,” the FTC report noted, “these four entities and their subsidiaries (which include the largest PBMs) collectively engaged in more than 190 transactions over the 2016 to 2023 period (UHG, 88; CVS, 53; Humana, 39; and Cigna, 14).”</span></p><p>UHG, for instance, is one of the top PBMs, but it also employs 10% of the doctors in America, is America’s biggest health insurer, runs Optum Bank through which bailout funds during Covid flowed to hospitals, and even owns Change Health, the large payment network for hospitals and pharmacies. More importantly, the big PBMs, while they contract with independent pharmacies, also own their own retail and mail-order pharmacies, thus setting the reimbursement rates for themselves and their competitors. (UHG is a frequent target of medical comedian Dr Glaucomflecken.)</p><div id="youtube2-_khH6pZnHCM" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;_khH6pZnHCM&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:&quot;1s&quot;,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_khH6pZnHCM?start=1s&amp;rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><p>The other change was the legalization of price discrimination, which fostered an era of secretive pricing. </p><p><span>PBMs had been clerical agents, paid by insurers to negotiate with drug makers, or on a per transaction basis to handle transactions. But in 1987, Congress passed an </span><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/12/02/2020-26072/medicare-and-state-health-care-programs-fraud-and-abuse-revisions-to-safe-harbors-under-the" rel="">exemption</a><span> to a Medicare Anti-Kickback statute, which created a safe harbor for group buying entities to accept payment from drug manufacturers in the form of rebates, with certain guardrails in place. Enabling kickbacks created a clear conflict of interest, since a PBM is supposed to be negotiating for the buyer, but could now be paid by the seller. The second change was an antitrust </span><a href="https://foleyhoag.com/getattachment/d63b4cbe-7427-49f4-becb-63b6130362fd/FOLEY-HOAG-LLP-WHITEPAPER-Antitrust-Implications-of-a-Proposed-HHS-Rule-to-Limit-Manufacturer-Rebates.pdf?lang=en-US" rel="">suit in 1994</a><span>, where pharmacies sued to get the same discounts for drugs offered to health insurance plans and hospitals. In the settlement of that case, the parties and the judge said that if a buyer was big enough that it could prove it could shift market shares, it was entitled to a secret rebate. And the third was in 1999 when the government used its authority to explicitly say that rebates were permissible legal discounts. Today’s system, where PBMs get large secret rebates in return for allocating market shares, was born. </span></p><p>Today, it’s virtually impossible to get any clear pricing on most drugs, because there is no one price. There are different benchmarks, for instance the one I used above to describe what manufacturers get for selling Gleevec. But there are other benchmarks depending on who you are, such as average wholesale price (AWP), wholesale acquisition cost (WAC), Average Sales Price (ASP), Average Manufacturer Price (AMP), Maximum Allowable Cost (MAC), Usual and Customary (U&amp;C), etc, each of which means something different, and many of which are arbitrary mark-ups designed to make it looks like there are discounts when there aren’t, or to extract extra money from pharmacists or patients.</p><p>Many drug pricing contracts use several of these benchmarks, along with rebates, reimbursements, and fees that are sometimes assessed six months after a point of sale transaction goes through. The endless number of such adjustments make it impossible to know what anything costs. Just one PBM, for instance, has over ten thousand different price lists for drug reimbursement rates, sometimes updated daily, which means the price of a particular drug depends on who you are, when you bought it, other drugs you might have purchased, or what the PBM executive had for lunch. </p><p>Pharmacists are often not allowed to look at the price they would be given for reimbursement prior to submitting a claim because, as one PBM manual notes, "price lists are the PBMs confidential and proprietary information." There are often multiple prices for the same transaction. A drug might seem like it costs $100 at the point of sale for a drug that cost the pharmacist $50, where the patient would pay a $60 copay and the insurer paid $40. But then six months later the PBM will claw back $75 from the pharmacist in what’s called a DIR fee. In that case, because of the copay, the insurer/PBM is actually extracting money from both the patient whose medical costs it should be covering, and the pharmacy it should be reimbursing. The whole system is insane . </p><p>Price discrimination and consolidation weren’t separate phenomena, but drove each other. In fact, if a PBM had to charge the same price for its service to all comers, then it would not matter if a PBM were big; a drug manufacturer negotiating with a PBM would have to give the same price, regardless of size. It also wouldn’t make sense to own its own pharmacy, nor could it charge different amounts for cancer drugs and keep the difference. But the legalization of price discrimination changed the market. And today, there’s really no way to convey how weird this world of pricing is, except that it feels Soviet and arbitrary to everyone in it. </p><p>The legislation of price discrimination happened in areas beyond PBMs and health care, it is perhaps the biggest victory of the law and economic school, and certainly one of the most important legal shifts in our society in the last fifty years, far more impactful than most of the economic fights we hear about.</p><p>Before the 1980s, it had been a fundamental axiom of America that everyone gets access to the same publicly posted price for the same class of service or good. Grangers fought for this principle in the 1870s, populists in the 1880s, business and labor leaders at the 1899 conference on trusts agreed on it even though they disagreed on everything else, it was understood as part of the Sherman Act in 1890, explicitly embedded into the Clayton Act in 1914, written into the Robinson-Patman Act of 1936, and across dozens of statutes across state and Federal government, from railroad to shipping to electric utility rules. </p><p><span>I mean, even the conservative Heritage Foundation advising the Reagan administration in 1981 decried secret rebates and discounting to select customers. “These kinds of discounts seem contrary,” </span><a href="https://www.jcampbell.com/docs-campbell/articles/1981_Mandate_for_Leadership.pdf" rel="">it said</a><span>, “to basic American precepts of justice, as they would “effectively end the value of publicly posted prices” and “favor the large organized interests with competitive alternatives at the expense of the unorganized, uneducated, or captive.” That’s the main policy recommendation to the most conservative Republican President since Herbert Hoover. </span></p><p><span>But starting in the 1970s, economists decided that price discrimination, far from problematic, was actually </span><em>efficient. </em><span>Indeed, if you could charge a high price to the rich, and a low price to the poor, then price discrimination could also be </span><em>progressive. </em><span>What could be wrong with selective discounting, after all? It turns out, plenty, and if you want to understand why, just look at PBMs.</span></p><p>Today, as a result of these changes, PBMs are big. Really big. The parent insurance companies of the biggest PBMs top nearly $1 trillion in revenue annually, roughly 4% of the GDP of America. Just the top four equal 22% of national healthcare expenditures, up from 14% in 2016. And no other country has anything like the PBM industry. The revenue of American PBMs is larger than what France spends on its entire healthcare system.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F170f8bd4-e509-468b-9ea5-27257abb62de_865x422.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F170f8bd4-e509-468b-9ea5-27257abb62de_865x422.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F170f8bd4-e509-468b-9ea5-27257abb62de_865x422.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F170f8bd4-e509-468b-9ea5-27257abb62de_865x422.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F170f8bd4-e509-468b-9ea5-27257abb62de_865x422.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F170f8bd4-e509-468b-9ea5-27257abb62de_865x422.png" width="865" height="422" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/170f8bd4-e509-468b-9ea5-27257abb62de_865x422.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:422,&quot;width&quot;:865,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:82663,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F170f8bd4-e509-468b-9ea5-27257abb62de_865x422.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F170f8bd4-e509-468b-9ea5-27257abb62de_865x422.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F170f8bd4-e509-468b-9ea5-27257abb62de_865x422.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F170f8bd4-e509-468b-9ea5-27257abb62de_865x422.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>The top three PBMs have immense market power. While it looks like an oligopoly, PBMs have monopolies in certain areas. OptumRx, for instance, runs 83% of the South Carolina retail pharmacy network management services, while a different PBM has 85% of the market in Alabama. If you are a company or union that needs to buy prescription drugs or if you are a pharmacist that dispenses prescriptions, you have to run on their rails.</p><p>And they use their size and bulk to thwart rivals. They use information from their insurance arms to conduct marketing campaigns targeting patients of rival pharmacists. They make it easier to buy drugs if you buy them from their mail order pharmacy, a practice known as steering, they impose endless fees on pharmacies, and they also take kickbacks from pharmaceutical manufacturers to steer their patients to more expensive medication and cut off access to cheaper generics. They also go after rival PBMs, with the FTC noting that “Some health insurers reportedly do not permit their clients to comparison shop for PBM services; rather, the client must use the PBM affiliated with the health insurer.” (The giant PBMs also have exclusive contracts with certain pharmaceutical makers, which means that if you don’t use those PBMs you just can’t get critical medicines.) </p><p>The net effect is higher prices. Here, for instance, is a rebate contract for Sanofi’s Lantus, a popular branded insulin. The list price might be high, but that’s not all going to Sanofi. In fact, 63% of that was going to the PBM in the form of a rebate, as long as Lantus is the only insulin offered to the patient. In other words, there’s competition, but not to lower prices to the consumer, but to pay higher rebates to the PBM.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ebc71a7-da5a-45ca-bb0e-7cc51eff637a_692x622.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ebc71a7-da5a-45ca-bb0e-7cc51eff637a_692x622.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ebc71a7-da5a-45ca-bb0e-7cc51eff637a_692x622.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ebc71a7-da5a-45ca-bb0e-7cc51eff637a_692x622.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ebc71a7-da5a-45ca-bb0e-7cc51eff637a_692x622.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ebc71a7-da5a-45ca-bb0e-7cc51eff637a_692x622.png" width="692" height="622" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0ebc71a7-da5a-45ca-bb0e-7cc51eff637a_692x622.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:622,&quot;width&quot;:692,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:331850,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ebc71a7-da5a-45ca-bb0e-7cc51eff637a_692x622.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ebc71a7-da5a-45ca-bb0e-7cc51eff637a_692x622.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ebc71a7-da5a-45ca-bb0e-7cc51eff637a_692x622.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ebc71a7-da5a-45ca-bb0e-7cc51eff637a_692x622.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>It’s not just insulin, of course. Take the most expensive drug historically in America by aggregate revenue, Humira, which made over $22 billion for AbbVie in 2022. It recently lost its patent protection, and there are several generics, known as ‘biosimilars,’ coming into the market. Several drug manufacturers (Coherus, Sandoz, Boehringer Ingelheim, etc.) invested in developing biosimilars to launch when the Humira patent expired.&nbsp; These drugs brought the sticker price of the drug down 10x from $80,000 per year to as low as $8,000 per year.</p><p>But none of these are able to get onto the shelf. Instead, what happened is that CVS started a drug manufacturing company called Cordavis to sell Humira biosimilars to its specialty pharmacy (CVS Specialty). They charge $1,300 per month, compared to some that are less than half that.&nbsp; Since CVS owns a PBM they controlled the formularies - and therefore the drug access - of between a fourth and third of Americans.&nbsp; They directed their PBM to preference their own drug through Cordavis and ignore the other biosimilars available on the market from smaller pharma companies, adding what I’m told is $50-100 million to CVS’s bottom line.</p><p>The negative impacts are twofold. First, consumers have to pay much more for the drug. Second, the pharma companies who invested to make biosimilars suffered financial losses. Here’s the share price of Coherus, which makes a Humira biosimilar.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3377be93-103d-4c79-8d68-ef06be8c181c_1020x454.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3377be93-103d-4c79-8d68-ef06be8c181c_1020x454.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3377be93-103d-4c79-8d68-ef06be8c181c_1020x454.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3377be93-103d-4c79-8d68-ef06be8c181c_1020x454.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3377be93-103d-4c79-8d68-ef06be8c181c_1020x454.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3377be93-103d-4c79-8d68-ef06be8c181c_1020x454.png" width="1020" height="454" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3377be93-103d-4c79-8d68-ef06be8c181c_1020x454.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:454,&quot;width&quot;:1020,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:92975,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3377be93-103d-4c79-8d68-ef06be8c181c_1020x454.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3377be93-103d-4c79-8d68-ef06be8c181c_1020x454.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3377be93-103d-4c79-8d68-ef06be8c181c_1020x454.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3377be93-103d-4c79-8d68-ef06be8c181c_1020x454.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>That means we won’t see any more biosimilar R&amp;D anymore, because everyone knows that PBMs will block them from the market. </p><p><span>For decades, PBMs operated in the shadows. But the passage of Obamacare changed the dynamic of health care, because it capped the profits of health insurance companies. To get out from under this cap, insurers began vertically integrating into different areas, and in the 2010s, every major PBM turned into an arm of a conglomerate. (See “</span><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/how-obamacare-created-big-medicine" rel="">How Obamacare Created Big Medicine</a><span>”.)

And there have been dozens of PBM-related hearings - the </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/pro/health-care-policy/2024/07/09/pbm-execs-testify-july-23" rel="">next one</a><span> is on July 23 with the CEOs of the ExpressScript, OptumRX, and Caremark - and Congress is closer to passing PBM legislation than it has ever been. </span></p><p><span>For decades, the FTC, far from helping, was on the wrong side of the argument. Its economists had promoted the idea that price discrimination and rebates were good, that vertical integration made sense, that PBM consolidation would help consumers, and that a PBM owning a mail order pharmacy was not a conflict of interest, but was efficient. But in 2021, then-FTC Commissioner Rohit Chopra </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_statements/1590528/statement_of_commissioner_rohit_chopra_regarding_the_commissions_report_on_pharmacy_benefit_manager.pdf" rel="">shocked</a><span> the commission by attacking his own agency, saying “There is a growing consensus that the Federal Trade Commission’s approach… is not working.” In 2022, the FTC put out a </span><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/corporate-bribery-just-became-illegal" rel="">policy statement</a><span> saying that the use of rebates by dominant middlemen in the insulin market were a potential legal violation. It also launched the investigation that led to this report.</span></p><p>What’s interesting is that the report is not final, because PBMs would not submit the information the FTC subpoena’d. In fact, some of the PBMs said they would send certain documentation until 2025. It’s a clear run out the clock strategy. The FTC could sue the PBMs to get this information, but it’s not clear that would be faster, and it would eat up litigation resources. And there’s good original information in the report, including the cancer drug analysis overpayment story, which is based on raw claims data. Normally, the commission waits until it has completed its analysis to publish a report, but in this case, the FTC sought to release the interim analysis and publicly name the PBMs as operating as bad faith actors for withholding information. </p><p><span>The politics then flipped. The vote to release the report was 4-1, with the three Democrats seeking to put it out, along with Republican FTC Commissioner Andrew Ferguson. Ferguson not only </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/Ferguson-Statement-Pharmacy-Benefit-Managers-Report.pdf" rel="">voted</a><span> to release the report, but said that the FTC should have sued, arguing they weren’t being aggressive enough. His colleague Melissa Holyoak, however, </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/cases-proceedings/public-statements/holyoak-statement-on-pharmacy-benefit-managers-report" rel="">dissented</a><span>, and said the report needed economic analysis to show that consumer prices were affected. It was a standard U.S. Chamber of Commerce process-troll, and Holyoak likely thought she would get plaudits for opposing Lina Khan. Instead, at a Congressional hearing, multiple Republican members were annoyed with her, including Rep. Buddy Carter, who is an actual pharmacist that needed to deal with PBMs and understood the problem up close.</span></p><p>A lot of government reports sit on the shelf and gather dust. This one won’t. It’ll lead to litigation by the FTC, and it’ll change litigation and state-level lawmaking happening all over the country around PBMs. It will also affect private markets, as CEOs begin asking why they are paying so much for their pharmaceuticals.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>Picture this: It's ten years ago, and you've just launched a new WordPress blog. Within hours, sometimes even minutes, your content is indexed by Google. You search for a unique sentence from your latest post, and there it is, right on the first page of Google. It felt like magic, didn't it?</p>
<p>This was Google living up to its mission: "to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible." For users, it meant that if the information existed somewhere on the web, a bit of clever searching would unearth it. For content creators, it was a golden opportunity: create content, and Google will make sure it's found.</p>
<h2>The SEO Arms Race and Google's Response</h2>
<p>But where there's opportunity, there's also exploitation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Low-quality content flooding the web</li>
<li>Link buying and selling</li>
<li>Lots of grey and black hat SEO stuff</li>
</ul>
<p>Google introduced a series of algorithm updates, each more sophisticated than the last. Panda, Penguin, and their successors aimed to clean up what Google saw as manipulative SEO practices.</p>
<p>This wasn't a one-time event, but more like a two-decade-long dance between SEOs and Google. Each side continually adapted, with Google rolling out updates and SEOs finding new ways to optimize within (and sometimes outside) the guidelines.</p>
<h2>The Rise and Fall of "Content is King"</h2>
<p>Amid this ongoing battle between SEOs and Google, a new mantra emerged in the industry: "Content is King". This concept had two main aspects:</p>
<ol>
<li>Good content will naturally attract links and possibly generate positive user interaction signals, which could improve rankings.</li>
<li>Google's algorithms would inherently value and rank high-quality content.</li>
</ol>
<p>The idea was that by focusing on creating great content, websites could improve their SEO without resorting to more technical or potentially manipulative tactics.</p>
<p>However, this concept was never fully true. Many creators of genuinely good content never achieved the rankings they felt they deserved, showing that quality alone wasn't enough. At the same time, it wasn't entirely false either - good content did often perform well in search results.</p>
<p>One of the fundamental issues was that neither Google nor anyone else could algorithmically determine "good" content.</p>
<p>The mantra served as a useful simplification for SEOs and content creators, giving them a clear goal to aim for. It was also a convenient explanation for Google when SEOs delved too deeply into technical details - they could always fall back on "just create good content".</p>
<h2>The AI Content Revolution</h2>
<p>Fast forward to 2018. OpenAI releases GPT-1, and suddenly, the future of content creation becomes crystal clear. AI-generated content, indistinguishable from human-written text, is on the horizon. The "content is king" era is coming to an end.</p>
<h2>Google's Existential Crisis</h2>
<p>Now, put yourself in Google's shoes. You're facing a future where AI can generate infinite amounts of human-like content. What do you do?</p>
<p>Google's response was twofold:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Promote the vague concept of E-A-T (Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness). In practice, this translates to favoring well-known brands and established websites.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abandon the mission of indexing everything. Instead, become selective. Very selective.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>The New Reality: Selective Indexing</h2>
<p>This brings us to the current state of affairs: Google is no longer trying to index the entire web. In fact, it's become extremely selective, refusing to index most content. This isn't about content creators failing to meet some arbitrary standard of quality. Rather, it's a fundamental change in how Google approaches its role as a search engine.</p>
<p>From my experience, Google now seems to operate on a "default to not index" basis. It only includes content in its index when it perceives a genuine need. This decision appears to be based on various factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extreme content uniqueness: It's not enough to write about something that isn't extensively covered. Google seems to require content to be genuinely novel or fill a significant gap in its index.</li>
<li>Perceived authority: Sites that Google considers highly authoritative in their niche may have more content indexed, but even then, it's not guaranteed.</li>
<li>Brand recognition: Well-known brands often see most of their content indexed, while small or unknown bloggers face much stricter selectivity.</li>
<li>Temporary indexing and de-indexing: In practice, Google often indexes new content quite quickly, likely to avoid missing out on breaking news or important updates. Soon after, Google may de-index the content, and it remains de-indexed thereafter. So getting initially indexed isn't necessarily a sign that Google considers your content valuable.</li>
</ul>
<p>I've observed this shift firsthand. In the past, when I set up a new domain, it would be indexed within an hour or faster, sometimes in seconds. This was true even for brand new domains with no mentions anywhere and no backlinks. When I searched for the title of one of those brand new blog posts or some unique sentence from the article, it would be right there on the first Google page.</p>
<p>Now, for each piece of content, Google decides if it's worth indexing, and more often than not, the answer seems to be "no." They might index content they perceive as truly unique or on topics that aren't covered at all. But if you write about a topic that Google considers even remotely addressed elsewhere, they likely won't index it. This can happen even if you're a well-respected writer with a substantial readership.</p>
<p>Interestingly, I've noticed that when content does manage to get indexed, it often ranks surprisingly well. It's as if the hurdle of getting indexed has become so high that once you clear it, you're already most of the way to ranking. However, getting to that point has become exponentially more difficult.</p>
<p>Importantly, this extreme selectivity isn't applied equally. Big, recognized brands often see most of their content indexed quickly, while small bloggers or niche websites face a much higher bar for inclusion. For these smaller players, it's not just about creating good content anymore – it's about convincing Google that your content is absolutely necessary for their index.</p>
<h2>The Consequences</h2>
<p>Google has transformed from a comprehensive search engine into something more akin to an exclusive catalog.</p>
<p>For users, it means that the information they're looking for might exist but remain undiscoverable through Google.</p>
<p>I'm sure that a vast amount of valuable content is being overlooked. Information that you might search for may never appear in Google's results. Not because it doesn't exist, but because Google has chosen not to include it.</p>
<p>For content creators, it presents a significant challenge: how do you gain visibility if Google refuses to index most of your content?</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.typefox.io/blog/open-collaboration-tools-announcement/">https://www.typefox.io/blog/open-collaboration-tools-announcement/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40970621">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><header><p>Jul 10th 2024</p><div><p><img alt="Dr. Miro Spönemann" loading="lazy" width="0" height="0" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://www.typefox.io/avatars/miro.webp">Dr. Miro Spönemann</p><p><img alt="Mark Sujew" loading="lazy" width="0" height="0" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://www.typefox.io/avatars/mark.webp">Mark Sujew</p></div></header><div><h3>We are thrilled to unveil our latest open source project: Open Collaboration Tools.</h3>
<p>Itʼs a collection of libraries and tools for live-sharing of IDE contents, designed to boost remote teamwork with open technologies.</p>
<p>The basic idea is simple: one person starts a collaboration session as host and invites others to join.
The IDE extension distributes the contents of the hostʼs workspace and highlights text selections and cursor positions of other participants.
In parallel, they get together in their favorite meeting or chat app for immediate discussion.
All participants see what the others are looking at and and what changes they propose in real-time.
This way of remote collaboration reduces confusion and maximizes productivity.</p>
<p>In its first public release, Open Collaboration Tools is available with the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li>A VS Code Extension available on <a href="https://open-vsx.org/extension/typefox/open-collaboration-tools">Open VSX</a> and the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=typefox.open-collaboration-tools">VS Code Marketplace</a></li>
<li>An <a href="https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/pull/13309">extension for Eclipse Theia</a></li>
<li>A server application for handling authentication and collaboration sessions, with a public instance available at <code>api.open-collab.tools</code></li>
<li>An open and extensible protocol with TypeScript libraries facilitating its integration in different environments</li>
<li>End-to-end encryption and extensible user authentication built-in right from the start</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, an integration with Monaco Editor will be available soon.
This unprecedented feature is particularly exciting because it enables fully customizable live collaboration between users of a web application or even between a website and a local IDE.
Finally youʼll be able to join a live-sharing session started from a full-fledged development environment, simply by opening a website link!</p>
<p>The initial version of Open Collaboration Tools focuses on plain text documents: source code of any programming language, Markdown documents, scripting languages, domain-specific languages, configuration formats, HTML and other markup languages, etc.
But the story doesnʼt end here – we are going to add support for other kinds of content creation such as Jupyter Notebooks, diagram editors, and more.
The underlying protocol and infrastructure is adaptible to numerous scenarios where real-time collaborative viewing and editing can be helpful.</p>
<h2>Motivation for new collaboration tools</h2>
<p>In our daily work with customers, we have seen the need for collaborative editing inside of IDEs over and over again.
While there are a few products out there aiming to provide collaborative editing experiences for their users, none of them were quite right for our customers.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at an exemplary use case: You are an engineer at a microchip design company.
You’re using a textual programming language to design chips. To improve productivity, you also have the option to use a graphical editor in your IDE to modify chip design files.
Given that these designs are highly sensitive, your company doesn’t want any information about them leaving the company network.
Now, you want to do some pair-programming with a coworker. What kind of tool can you choose to facilitate that?</p>
<p>To our dismay, nothing available fits that bill. What we need is a solution that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Can be plugged into any popular IDE, ideally even support cross-IDE use cases.</li>
<li>Is designed to be extensible. Adding custom editors beyond just text can be done with reasonable effort.</li>
<li>Runs on premise to ensure absolute data security.</li>
<li>Does not bind you to a single vendor. A permissive license would be best to keep control of your tools.</li>
</ol>
<p>Looking at the 3 most popular collaborative editing tools, we will find that at least one of those requirements isn’t supported:</p>

<p>
<span>
    <sup id="footnote1">1</sup> The Microsoft proprietary license allows usage free of charge, but restricts the extension to run only in officially distributed Microsoft products (i.e. no VSCodium, Coder, Gitpod or Theia).
</span>
</p>
<p>Faced with this issue, we are now taking matters into our own hands.
This is why the Open Collaboration Tools project is designed with a few core principles in mind:</p>
<ol>
<li>No vendor lock-in: Allow to potentially support any IDE and even your own web application.</li>
<li>Absolute extensibility: The underlying protocol can be extended to enable collaboration for any kind of editor.</li>
<li>Run wherever you like: Run the server infrastructure on any system, be it locally, on premise or in the cloud.</li>
<li>Open Source Licensing: The whole project is licensed under the <a href="https://opensource.org/license/mit">MIT License</a> and can be used by anyone, in any way they like.</li>
</ol>
<h2>The Open Collaboration Protocol</h2>
<p>The technology to facilitate all of the above is the <em>Open Collaboration Protocol</em>.
This protocol specifies how the IDE is supposed to authenticate with a collaboration server, how to create or join a session, and what kind of data is exchanged between users within each session.</p>
<p>On a technical level, this is done via a <em>centralized peer-to-peer</em> mechanism.
Any user within a session can send an arbitrary notification or request to any other user.
Additionally, a broadcasting mechanism allows to send a message to all other users.
From a network perspective, each user only communicates to a central server.
It is used as a message broker that sends the messages to their respective targets.
As a consequence, the server is completely oblivious about the actual content of a message – and we can use that to our advantage.</p>
<p>This kind of brokering mechanism enables limitless extensibility of the protocol.
As long as the two communicating clients understand each other’s messages, they can work together.
For example, if I build an IDE with a built-in graphical editor, I just need to additionally send messages to synchronize edits across multiple users and handle any incoming synchronization messages.
The protocol already contains built-in support for basic text editors, with more to come soon!</p>
<h2>The big picture</h2>
<p>The new Open Collaboration Tools project fits perfectly into our overall strategy: to provide highly customizable tools and frameworks under permissive open source licenses.
TypeFox supports businesses to adapt the open source software to their needs and make the best possible use of it to maximize their productivity.</p>
<p>In the beginning, we mentioned that a public instance of Open Collaboration Tools is now available at <code>api.open-collab.tools</code>.
TypeFox offers this service with the intent to demonstrate the capabilities of our new project and to support open source communities with it.
However, we recommend all companies who wish to adopt this new technology to deploy their own instance of it, secured with their existing access restrictions.
<a href="https://www.typefox.io/contact/">Get in touch with us</a> if you’re interested about support for the customization, deployment and usage of collaboration servers.</p>
<p>We are committed to invest further into the Open Collaboration Tools and grow the number and depth of its integrations over time. In the meantime, please check out the new website at <a href="https://www.open-collab.tools/">www.open-collab.tools</a> and help us spread the word!</p>

<h2 id="what-is-scale">What is SCALE?<a href="#what-is-scale" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>SCALE is a GPGPU programming toolkit that allows CUDA applications to be
natively compiled for AMD GPUs.</p>
<p>SCALE does not require the CUDA program or its build system to be modified.</p>
<p>Support for more GPU vendors and CUDA APIs is in development.</p>
<p>To get started:</p>
<ul>
<li>See the <a href="https://docs.scale-lang.com/manual/how-to-use/">tutorial</a>.</li>
<li>Review the <a href="https://docs.scale-lang.com/examples/">examples</a>.</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?<a href="#how-does-it-work" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>SCALE has several key innovations compared to other cross-platform GPGPU
solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>SCALE accepts CUDA programs as-is. No need to port them to another 
  language. This is true even if your program uses inline PTX <code>asm</code>.</li>
<li>The SCALE compiler accepts the same command-line options and CUDA dialect
  as <code>nvcc</code>, serving as a drop-in replacement.</li>
<li>"Impersonates" an installation of the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit, so existing 
  build tools and scripts like <code>cmake</code> <em>just work</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-projects-have-been-tested">What projects have been tested?<a href="#what-projects-have-been-tested" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>We validate SCALE by compiling open-source CUDA projects and running their
tests.
The following open-source projects are currently part of our nightly automated 
tests and pass fully:</p>
<ul>

<li>AMD <code>gfx1030</code> (Navi 21, RDNA 2.0)</li>
<li>AMD <code>gfx1100</code> (Navi 31, RDNA 3.0)</li>
</ul>
<p>The following GPU targets have undergone ad-hoc manual testing and "seem to

<ul>
<li>AMD <code>gfx1010</code></li>
<li>AMD <code>gfx1101</code></li>
</ul>
<p>We are working on supporting the following GPUs:</p>

<li>AMD <code>gfx900</code> (Vega 10, GCN 5.0)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-are-the-components-of-scale">What are the components of SCALE?<a href="#what-are-the-components-of-scale" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>SCALE consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>An <code>nvcc</code>-compatible compiler capable of compiling nvcc-dialect CUDA for AMD
  GPUs, including PTX asm.</li>
<li>Implementations of the CUDA runtime and driver APIs for AMD GPUs.</li>
<li>Open-source wrapper libraries providing the "CUDA-X" APIs by delegating to the
  corresponding ROCm libraries.
  This is how libraries such as <code>cuBLAS</code> and <code>cuSOLVER</code> are handled.</li>
</ul>

<p>Instead of providing a <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">new way</a> to write GPGPU 
software, SCALE allows programs written using the widely-popular CUDA
language to be directly compiled for AMD GPUs.</p>
<p>SCALE aims to be fully compatible with NVIDIA CUDA. We believe that users 
should not have to maintain multiple codebases or compromise on performance
to support multiple GPU vendors.</p>
<p>SCALE's language is a <em>superset</em> of NVIDIA CUDA, offering some opt-in
<a href="https://docs.scale-lang.com/manual/language-extensions/">language extensions</a>
that can make writing GPU code easier and more efficient for users who wish
to move away from <code>nvcc</code>.</p>
<p>SCALE is a work in progress. If there is a missing API that is blocking your
attempt to use SCALE, please contact us so we can prioritise its development.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I hate flaky tests.</p>
<p>We repeatedly run our suite of tests during development time and on every commit, so if a test is flaky, developers quickly learn not to trust it. It’s so easy to just retry and assume everything is fine. This is the worst of both worlds because the test isn’t providing value as an indication that something needs to be fixed and it drags out the review-merge cycle with test reruns. </p>
<p>Across a modest-sized development team, even a test that flakes 1 in 100 will burn one of your devs every day on average.</p>
<p>Today we’re going to dive deep into one particular area that’s hard to get right: code that depends on time.</p>
<h2>Repeatability and Determinism</h2>
<p>If your code is supposed to do something at 8pm every day, you can’t just wait around until 8pm to test that it does the right thing. Similarly, if your code is supposed to do something after 30 minutes, you probably don’t want to wait 30 minutes to know if it’s working correctly.</p>
<p>One approach is to make the values “8pm” and “30 minutes” configurable, and choose them at test time. This can work, but it has drawbacks.</p>
<p>One is repeatability: the tests will be operating on different times each run, and on different times than they would in production. I’ve seen flakes related to daylight savings time and whether the test happens to start at zero minutes past the hour.</p>
<p>The second is determinism. Compress 30 minutes into 30ms and your tests may no longer do things in the order you expect, since consumer operating systems don’t make hard guarantees about real-time processing. Writing tests this way is an explicit balancing act between fast and flake-free execution. It’s hard to get right, especially since development environments tend to have fast hardware and not a lot of resource contention, whereas CI runs on constrained and shared hardware.</p>
<h2>Introducing Quartz</h2>
<p>Today we are <a href="https://github.com/coder/quartz" target="_blank">introducing Quartz</a>, a mocking library in Go for testing code that depends on time.</p>
<p>By mocking out calls that query or depend on the real time, we can write unit tests that are repeatable, deterministic, and execute as quickly as the CPU allows. This is, in itself, not a new idea. In building Quartz, we took some inspiration from:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/benbjohnson/clock" target="_blank">github.com/benbjohnson/clock</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/coder/tailscale/blob/main/tstest/clock.go" target="_blank">Tailscale's tstest.Clock</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/aspenmesh/tock" target="_blank">github.com/aspenmesh/tock</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Quartz shares the high level design of a Clock interface that closely resembles the functions in the time standard library, and a "real" clock passes through to the standard library in production, while a mock clock gives precise control in testing.</p>
<p>For several reasons, it is a tall order to write tests that are repeatable, deterministic and fast, when it comes to code that depends on time. The rest of this blog post will discuss what these reasons are and why we found these existing libraries insufficient. If you are just ready to dive into unit testing with Quartz, head over to the repository now and look at the <a href="https://github.com/coder/quartz?tab=readme-ov-file#readme" target="_blank">README</a> and <a href="https://github.com/coder/quartz/blob/main/example_test.go" target="_blank">examples</a>.</p>
<p>I also want to give a big thank you to the authors of the above libraries. Discussing the limitations of the libraries in the next sections is not meant to imply these libraries are bad or not useful. To the extent that Quartz surpasses these limitations, it is only by standing on their shoulders.</p>
<h2>Preventing Test Flakes</h2>
<p>The following example comes from the README from benbjohnson/clock:</p>
<pre><code>mock := clock.NewMock()
count := <span>0</span>

<span>// Kick off a timer to increment every 1 mock second.</span>
<span>go</span> <span><span>func</span><span>()</span></span> {
    ticker := mock.Ticker(<span>1</span> * time.Second)
    <span>for</span> {
        &lt;-ticker.C
        count++
    }
}()
runtime.Gosched()

<span>// Move the clock forward 10 seconds.</span>
mock.Add(<span>10</span> * time.Second)

<span>// This prints 10.</span>
fmt.Println(count)</code></pre>
<p>The first race condition is fairly obvious: moving the clock forward 10 seconds may generate 10 ticks on the <code>ticker.C</code> channel, but there is no guarantee that <code>count++</code> executes before <code>fmt.Println(count)</code>.</p>
<p>The second race condition is more subtle, but <code>runtime.Gosched()</code> is the tell. Since the ticker is started on a separate goroutine, there is no guarantee that <code>mock.Ticker()</code> executes before <code>mock.Add()</code>. <code>runtime.Gosched()</code> is an attempt to get this to happen, but it makes no hard promises. On a busy system, especially when running tests in parallel, this can flake, advance the time 10 seconds first, then start the ticker and never generate a tick.</p>
<p>Let's talk about how Quartz tackles these problems.</p>
<p>In our experience, an extremely common use case is creating a ticker then doing a 2-arm <code>select</code> with ticks in one and context expiring in another, i.e.</p>
<pre><code>t := time.NewTicker(duration)
<span>for</span> {
    <span>select</span> {
    <span>case</span> &lt;-ctx.Done():
        <span>return</span> ctx.Err()
    <span>case</span> &lt;-t.C:
        err := do()
        <span>if</span> err != <span>nil</span> {
            <span>return</span> err
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>In Quartz, we refactor this to be more compact and testing friendly:</p>
<pre><code>t := clock.TickerFunc(ctx, duration, <span>do</span>)
<span>return</span> t.<span>Wait</span>()</code></pre>
<p>This affords the mock <code>Clock</code> the ability to explicitly know when processing of a tick is finished because it's wrapped in the function passed to <code>TickerFunc</code> (<code>do()</code> in this example).</p>
<p>In Quartz, when you advance the clock, you are returned an object you can <code>Wait()</code> on to ensure all ticks and timers triggered are finished. This solves the first race condition in the example.</p>
<p>(As an aside, we still support a traditional standard library-style <code>Ticker</code>. You may find it useful if you want to keep your code as close as possible to the standard library, or if you need to use the channel in a larger <code>select</code> block. In that case, you'll have to find some other mechanism to sync tick processing to your test code.)</p>
<p>To prevent race conditions related to the starting of the ticker, Quartz allows you to set "traps" for calls that access the clock.</p>
<pre><code>func <span>TestTicker</span>(t *testing.T) {
    mClock := quartz<span>.NewMock</span>(t)
    trap := mClock<span>.Trap</span>()<span>.TickerFunc</span>()
    defer trap<span>.Close</span>() <span>// stop trapping at end</span>
    go <span>runMyTicker</span>(mClock) <span>// async calls TickerFunc()</span>
    call := trap<span>.Wait</span>(context<span>.Background</span>()) <span>// waits for a call and blocks its return</span>
    call<span>.Release</span>() <span>// allow the TickerFunc() call to return</span>
    <span>// optionally check the duration using call.Duration</span>
    <span>// Move the clock forward 1 tick</span>
    mClock<span>.Advance</span>(<span>time</span>.Second)<span>.MustWait</span>(context<span>.Background</span>())
    <span>// assert results of the tick</span>
}</code></pre>
<p>Trapping and then releasing the call to <code>TickerFunc()</code> ensures the ticker is started at a deterministic time, so our calls to <code>Advance()</code> will have a predictable effect.</p>
<p>Take a look at <code>TestExampleTickerFunc</code> in <code>example_test.go</code> for a complete worked example.</p>
<h2>Complex Time Dependence</h2>
<p>Another difficult issue to handle when unit testing is when some code under test makes multiple calls that depend on the time, and you want to simulate some time passing between them.</p>
<p>A very basic example is measuring how long something took:</p>
<pre><code><span>var</span> measurement <span>time</span><span>.Duration</span>
go <span>func</span>(clock quartz.Clock) {
    start := clock<span>.Now</span>()
    <span>doSomething</span>()
    measurement = clock<span>.Since</span>(start)
}(mClock)

<span>// how to get measurement to be, say, 5 seconds?</span></code></pre>
<p>The two calls into the clock happen asynchronously, so we need to be able to advance the clock after the first call to <code>Now()</code> but before the call to <code>Since()</code>. Doing this with the libraries we mentioned above means that you have to be able to mock out or otherwise block the completion of <code>doSomething()</code>.</p>
<p>But, with the trap functionality we mentioned in the previous section, you can deterministically control the time each call sees.</p>
<pre><code>trap := mClock<span>.Trap</span>()<span>.Since</span>()
<span>var</span> measurement <span>time</span><span>.Duration</span>
go <span>func</span>(clock quartz.Clock) {
    start := clock<span>.Now</span>()
    <span>doSomething</span>()
    measurement = clock<span>.Since</span>(start)
}(mClock)

c := trap<span>.Wait</span>(ctx)
mClock<span>.Advance</span>(<span>5</span>*<span>time</span>.Second)
c<span>.Release</span>()</code></pre>
<p>We wait until we trap the <code>clock.Since()</code> call, which implies that <code>clock.Now()</code> has completed, then advance the mock clock 5 seconds. Finally, we release the <code>clock.Since()</code> call. Any changes to the clock that happen before we release the call will be included in the time used for the <code>clock.Since()</code> call.</p>
<p>As a more involved example, consider an inactivity timeout: we want something to happen if there is no activity recorded for some period, say 10 minutes in the following example:</p>
<pre><code>func (<span>i</span> *InactivityTimer) <span>Start</span>() {
    <span>i</span><span>.mu</span><span>.Lock</span>()
    defer <span>i</span><span>.mu</span><span>.Unlock</span>()
    next := <span>i</span><span>.clock</span><span>.Until</span>(<span>i</span><span>.activity</span><span>.Add</span>(<span>10</span>*<span>time</span>.Minute))
    t := <span>i</span><span>.clock</span><span>.AfterFunc</span>(next, <span>func</span>() {
        <span>i</span><span>.mu</span><span>.Lock</span>()
        defer <span>i</span><span>.mu</span><span>.Unlock</span>()
        next := <span>i</span><span>.clock</span><span>.Until</span>(<span>i</span><span>.activity</span><span>.Add</span>(<span>10</span>*<span>time</span>.Minute), <span>"inner"</span>)
        <span>if</span> next == <span>0</span> {
            <span>i</span><span>.timeoutLocked</span>()
            return
        }
        t<span>.Reset</span>(next)
    })
}</code></pre>
<p>All Quartz <code>Clock</code> functions, and functions on returned timers and tickers support zero or more string tags that allow traps to match on them.</p>
<pre><code>func <span>TestInactivityTimer_Late</span>(t *testing.T) {
    <span>// set a timeout on the test itself, so that if Wait functions get blocked, we don't have to</span>
    <span>// wait for the default test timeout of 10 minutes.</span>
    ctx, cancel := context<span>.WithTimeout</span>(<span>10</span>*<span>time</span>.Second)
    defer <span>cancel</span>()
    mClock := quartz<span>.NewMock</span>(t)
    trap := mClock<span>.Trap</span><span>.Until</span>(<span>"inner"</span>)
    defer trap<span>.Close</span>()

    it := &amp;InactivityTimer{
        activity: mClock<span>.Now</span>(),
        clock: mClock,
    }
    it<span>.Start</span>()

    <span>// Trigger the AfterFunc</span>
    w := mClock<span>.Advance</span>(<span>10</span>*<span>time</span>.Minute)
    c := trap<span>.Wait</span>(ctx)
    <span>// Advance the clock a few ms to simulate a busy system</span>
    mClock<span>.Advance</span>(<span>3</span>*<span>time</span>.Millisecond)
    c<span>.Release</span>() <span>// Until() returns</span>
    w<span>.MustWait</span>(ctx) <span>// Wait for the AfterFunc to wrap up</span>

    <span>// Assert that the timeoutLocked() function was called</span>
}</code></pre>
<p>This test case will fail with our bugged implementation, since the triggered AfterFunc won't call <code>timeoutLocked()</code> and instead will reset the timer with a negative number. The fix is easy, use <code>next &lt;= 0</code> as the comparison.</p>
<h2>Correspondence Principle</h2>
<p>One final criterion in designing Quartz’s API was the desire to be able to write unit tests that are easy to understand. </p>
<p>Time flows in one direction, from past to future, and I wanted unit tests written with Quartz to have the same monotonic flow and definite ordering. As you read a unit test from top to bottom, time advances forward, and you can define explicit breaks in the flow to inspect and assert the state of code under test, like breakpoints in debugger, or hitting the pause button while playing back a video.</p>
<p>Consider this example unit test from the Quartz repository. The color coding shows how time advances as the unit test executes.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/19109/1720191961-code-example.png"></p>
<p>From the perspective of the unit test function, the clock is always in a well defined state, and only changes state explicitly and synchronously.</p>
<p>The second ingredient for writing repeatable, deterministic unit tests is for the unit under test to be in a well defined state, with no races, when you make your test assertions. Quartz cannot guarantee this on its own, but it is designed to make this as easy as possible via</p>
<ol>
<li>Waiting for <code>Advance/AdvanceNext</code> calls to complete. When paired with <code>AfterFunc</code> and <code>TickerFunc</code>, this allows you to wait for the unit under test to complete its timeout or tick processing. You can then assert the results of that processing without any races.</li>
<li>Trapping calls into the Quartz library via the Clock interface, Timers and/or Tickers. These allow you to suspend execution of the unit under test at deterministic points, where you can make assertions or advance the clock.</li>
</ol>
<p>These two properties–clock in a well defined state, unit under test in a well defined state–mean that you can make test assertions without worry that they will flake. Polling (e.g. “Eventually”), sleeping, or calling runtime.Gosched() within your tests are all indications that your tests are not fully deterministic. It’s still possible to write tests that don’t flake this way, but it’s harder and you make trade-offs with speed.</p>
<h2>Present and Future of Quartz</h2>
<p>The current release is v0.1.0, reflecting the fact that we are not yet making an ironclad promise not to change the API before v1.0. I don’t anticipate any changes, but it seems premature to make that promise before Quartz sees much deployment outside of Coder.</p>
<p>Having used Quartz internally at Coder for some time, we feel it is stable enough for general, public use. Just don’t robotically upgrade the library without checking until we declare the v1.0 API, likely later this year.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/coder/quartz" target="_blank">Please give Quartz a try</a>. If you like it, star it! If you have any issues or feature requests, please write a GitHub issue on the repo.</p>

<p><span><sup>1</sup> You may retort that testing at different times of day and seasons of the year gives you more test coverage. For what it’s worth, both these flakes were test bugs related to computing the expected outputs, not product bugs. To the extent your code is sensitive to these factors, you want test cases for them, not the luck of the draw of when the test is run. That is, you don’t want to wait around until daylight savings time to know whether your code will work when it does.

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyj4emsl000q3b834ntpxpn2@published" data-word-count="76">One morning at the end of April 2023, Marcela Maus, a cancer researcher at Mass General in Boston, got a call from her colleague Bryan Choi. “He called me, and he’s like, ‘Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God!’ And I’m like, ‘What is going on?’” Maus said. Choi, a neurosurgeon with the languid demeanor of a surfer, was not given to outbursts. Maus hung up the phone and hurried over to his office.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjoblv2000q3b83hsylc7ab@published" data-word-count="77">The day before, Choi and Maus had treated their first patient in a clinical trial for an aggressive brain cancer called glioblastoma, infusing genetically modified white blood cells directly into the fluid surrounding the brain. They had been up all night worrying, especially after the patient, a 74-year-old man, developed a fever. Choi had ordered an MRI. “We were not looking for the results,” he said. “We were trying to make sure that our patient was okay.”</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjoblwl000r3b83mml2cp5f@published" data-word-count="83">When Maus got to Choi’s office, images from the MRI were loading on his screen. They stared in wonder: The patient’s tumor, which a few days before had shown up on the scan as a bright blob the size of a strawberry, had almost entirely disappeared. No one had heard of that kind of regression in glioblastoma, especially not overnight. “My first instinct was that there was something wrong with the MRI scanner,” Choi said. But then the follow-up scans looked even better.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobly3000s3b83j2fzsj6o@published" data-word-count="63">Several weeks later, they treated a second patient, a civil engineer from upstate New York named Tom Fraser, and the process repeated itself: the infusion, the fever, and the rapid regression of the tumor. “It was almost like clockwork,” Maus said, still sounding astonished months later. After a third patient had a similar response, she paused the trial and wrote up her results.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobm0q000t3b83rl3h29nm@published" data-word-count="67">Glioblastoma is the most common type of malignant brain cancer. It can strike at any age, and it’s uniformly fatal. Patients are often diagnosed in the emergency room after the tumor causes some somatic catastrophe, such as seizure, sudden loss of speech, or an inability to control the limbs on one side of the body. The median time from diagnosis to death is just over a year.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobm2z000u3b83cmlz7byg@published" data-word-count="107">The first step in treating the disease hasn’t changed in decades: “maximal safe resection,” a surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible while preserving neurological function. Because glioblastoma is so adept at infiltrating the brain, the surgeon almost always leaves cancer behind, which quickly starts growing again. Some patients respond to radiation or the chemotherapy drug temozolomide, but even that adds months rather than years to the average survival time. Roger Stupp, an expert in glioblastoma (he wrote the paper that made temozolomide “standard of care”), told me the disease had proved to be “a graveyard of ideas.” Decades of research have gone nowhere.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobm4n000v3b83cycggo54@published" data-word-count="64">Within the past 20 years, however, a once unfashionable field called immunotherapy has upended all expectations in oncology. It proceeds from a simple premise: The human immune system is very good at attacking anything it registers as disease. If it could be turned against cancer, it could eliminate a tumor more thoroughly than a surgeon’s knife and more durably than the poison of chemotherapy.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobm6k000w3b838t8ihiu3@published" data-word-count="100">Maus and Choi thought they’d found a way to do just that using the immune system’s all-purpose killer: the T cell, which the body sends to neutralize pathogens of all sorts, including bacteria, viruses, and parasites, but not (usually) cancer. By extracting T cells from a patient’s blood, editing the cells’ DNA in a lab, and reintroducing them at the site of the tumor, they had gotten the body to react to cancer as it would to a virus and destroy it. It was the culmination of years of research in immunotherapy labs like the one Maus runs at Mass General.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobm82000x3b83hqlqkxqx@published" data-word-count="71">Fraser remembers that on the day of his infusion, the room was crowded with doctors, nurses, and scientists. There was a sense, he said, that history was being made. “I felt a little poke when the needle was inserted,” he wrote me in an email, “but it was a very quick process.” Twenty-four days later, he walked out of the hospital, weak and exhausted but with his tumor in near-total remission.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobm9p000y3b83cee4xq8e@published" data-word-count="70">“There’s been a revolution in understanding cancer and the tools to tackle it,” Daniel Haber, the director of the Mass General Cancer Center, told me. Immunotherapy, paired with our greater understanding of the genetics of cancer cells, has produced breakthroughs for previously untreatable forms of the disease, especially in liquid tumors like leukemia and lymphoma and skin cancers like melanoma. Death sentences have been commuted; hopeless cases have been cured.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobmbk000z3b8313t6r5d6@published" data-word-count="77">Until recently, the biggest exception to this parade of good news has been in solid tumors like pancreatic cancer and glioblastoma, which have resisted almost all efforts to check them. So Fraser had it right. If these early results from Boston held, it would make history. If we can treat glioblastoma — perhaps the hardest case in a field made up of hard cases — there’s not a cancer that would seem to be out of reach.</p>

  

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobmhz00113b83efyfpqwx@published" data-word-count="54">After Choi and Maus published their results in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em> in March, they heard from oncologists all over the world. “They’re desperate, and they say, ‘We want to offer something because there’s just nothing out there,’” Choi told me. The status quo, Choi knew from his own patients, was miserable.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobmjx00123b83g71y2gl7@published" data-word-count="94">This spring, I got to witness the kind of brain surgery that’s standard of care for glioblastoma but may one day become obsolete. It was both simple and high-tech. Five figures in blue scrubs stood around the patient, and there were screens on every wall stacked like amps at a death-metal show. I was led around the operating table, ducking between machines until I arrived at the patient’s head, where the surgeon showed me how he could insert a stereotactic probe and see on the monitor exactly where in the brain he was working.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobml900133b83r0qn8t3y@published" data-word-count="93">A square of scalp on the patient’s head was peeled back to reveal the skull underneath. A smaller area of skull, about the size of an eye patch, had been removed, and the brain itself sat exposed, pulsing with each heartbeat, as if it were breathing. And it was: The engine of cognition, the seat of human consciousness, the anthropocentric core of the universe lay before us, and it was alive, fragile and yet somehow bursting with vitality, like it wanted nothing more than to leap free of the vessel that contained it.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobmmt00143b830e7wgy6a@published" data-word-count="57">On a screen on the far wall, I could see a hole where the tumor had been, an almost perfectly round miniature planet. I switched my gaze to look at the brain directly. The hole was darker than I would have imagined. I tried to stare all the way into its bottom but could see only black.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobmp700153b835jcwa7vr@published" data-word-count="81">Patients with glioblastoma are often sent to surgery within days of their diagnosis. The urgency comes both from the aggressiveness of the disease and the unique nature of the brain itself. Trapped inside the skull, there’s nowhere for it to go when a tumor begins growing. As normal tissue is pushed aside, the neurological effects can multiply quickly. Cancer elsewhere in the body can be debilitating, but it’s unlikely to suddenly take away your ability to speak, to move, to think.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobmqt00163b83sc9z8t3e@published" data-word-count="92">Maus and her team started enrolling new trial participants in May. Hundreds of people with glioblastoma have written to or called Mass General about the study, but Maus had room for only 18 more. I asked her whether they had already filled the remaining spots. She said they couldn’t: Until recently, her team could treat only one patient at a time, and the disease progresses too quickly to look more than a few months into the future. “It’s heartbreaking,” Maus said about having to turn people away. “You get a lot of stories.”</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobmv100173b83wgkctn6r@published" data-word-count="119">Not long ago, I spoke with Katie McKay, whose husband, Kevin, was diagnosed with a brain tumor in 2016. That summer, Katie and Kevin were driving down for a vacation in Myrtle Beach with their two children, ages 3 and 5. They had made good time from their home in Annapolis, so Kevin phoned the hotel and asked if they could check in early. Shortly after he hung up, he began convulsing and moaning. The kids were watching cartoons in the back seat, “and they thought he was playing a joke on them, like being like a monster, and I thought so too,” Katie said. “I grabbed his arm, and I realized his eyes were in the back of his head.”</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobn0l00183b83hmvgnill@published" data-word-count="62">Katie pulled to the side of the road and Kevin’s head fell in her lap. He was out for several minutes, during which he soiled himself. When he woke up, Katie was standing outside the passenger side of the car checking his pulse. “He’s like, ‘Katie, what are you doing?’ And I said, ‘Nothing, everything’s fine. Something seems a little off with you.’”</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobna200193b832zrc4i3g@published" data-word-count="102">At the hospital in Myrtle Beach, doctors saw two lesions on his brain. Kevin had his first surgery on August 2, at Johns Hopkins, and began radiation and chemotherapy. When Katie recounts the months that followed, her voice falters as she remembers how difficult their lives became. She kept spreadsheets of appointments and medications and leads to follow for novel treatments. “I started researching because I remember in the beginning going to a lot of the appointments and not knowing the lingo,” she said. “And I didn’t want to waste any more time asking somebody, ‘Can you tell me what they were talking about?’”</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobnbr001a3b83x7f1dizi@published" data-word-count="57">Katie and Kevin were college sweethearts. They met at the University of Maryland and married in 2010. He was so lovable, Katie said. He liked to play little pranks on the family: dropping habanero in Katie’s drink when she wasn’t watching or waking his mother-in-law up with a leaf blower. He was 32 when he was diagnosed.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobndf001b3b83qof7zqbd@published" data-word-count="114">Kevin remained optimistic even as the disease progressed, while Katie remained, in her words, the worrywart. “In the beginning,” she said, “I would cry and be so sad and have so much anxiety about it, worrying about his fate, and he would be like, ‘Hey, Katie, if not us, it would be somebody else.’” Eventually, he had to step back from his job as an engineer, and Katie had to drive him everywhere while trying to manage the kids’ schedules. She enrolled him in a trial at Johns Hopkins, but it didn’t seem to have much of an effect. He lost the ability to sense his left side. Soon, he could no longer speak.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobnf3001c3b83burfmkge@published" data-word-count="78">Kevin died in July 2018, two years after his first seizure. As the tumor spread throughout his brain, he qualified for a trial at MD Anderson Cancer Center, but Katie decided against it: “He was already in a wheelchair. He was in a diaper at that point, and I could not feasibly get him there.” She said she’d rather spend her final weeks with him at home than subject him to a treatment that likely would not work.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobnsl001e3b83skvrdl5p@published" data-word-count="61">When Maus started her Ph.D. in immunology a little more than 25 years ago, the idea that it could one day make brain tumors like Kevin’s disappear was laughable. “I was told that it was career suicide,” Maus said. “People had been trying for a hundred years to get the immune system to recognize cancer, and it was a dead end.”</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobnun001f3b833ljtn8cf@published" data-word-count="108">Maus is short and has an eager smile and dark, expressive eyebrows. When I met her at her lab at Mass General in a building one block from Boston Harbor, I got a sense of how she might have stuck it out despite the warnings from her colleagues. She was friendly but didn’t let me get away with being wrong, a practice seemingly honed from years of supervising Ph.D. students and postdocs. “Let me tweak that,” she would say back to me when I fumbled through a question about cellular biology. Her attraction to immunotherapy was simple: Because it <em>should</em> work, she was determined to make it work.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobo08001g3b83h06hbpos@published" data-word-count="76">Maus knew that though cancer has long confounded efforts to kill it, it has a vulnerability. Cancerous tissue can be a pinpoint or a swarm, but it is always made up of cells. And those cells have to be at least somewhat different from the other cells in the body, or they wouldn’t be cancer. If you could train the immune system’s T cells to recognize that difference, that would be the end of the disease.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobo63001h3b83tnb21537@published" data-word-count="59">Efforts to attain that goal have already reshaped oncology. Researchers have developed drugs that selectively bind to proteins in cancer cells, inactivating them (targeted therapies); they’ve discovered ways to attack tumors by modulating the body’s immune response (immune checkpoint inhibitors); and they’ve gotten good at growing white blood cells outside the body and reinfusing them to overwhelm a tumor.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobob7001i3b83o1je1qxz@published" data-word-count="120">Some of these approaches, while powerful, were a bit like flooding your house to get rid of the rats. What if we could hire an exterminator instead? Immunologists zeroed in on the T cell, learning how to manipulate its genetic code to prompt it to hunt for specific proteins on the surface of cancer cells; other changes made the T cells more active. This engineered T cell has a special name: a CAR-T cell. (car stands for “chimeric antigen receptor.” The receptor is what binds a T cell to a protein on a cell’s surface. Antigen is another name for that protein. And the chimera, in this case, is the hybrid between the T cell’s normal receptor and its genetically modified components.)</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobocy001j3b834o6bsb5g@published" data-word-count="62">A decade ago, when Maus was at the University of Pennsylvania, her mentor, the immunologist Carl June, developed an astonishingly effective CAR-T therapy for leukemia. In some forms of the disease, a class of white blood cells called B cells begins to divide rapidly. June and his team programmed their CAR-T cells to target a protein on the B cells’ surface called CD19.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjoboes001k3b83785rp1yn@published" data-word-count="95">The CAR-T cells did their job quickly and thoroughly, binding to CD19, eliminating the B cells, and curing the leukemia. Almost overnight, CAR-T cells became the most exciting technology in cancer. Today, more than 34,000 leukemia patients have received some form of CAR-T therapy, and there are some 1,100 different CAR-T trials underway around the world. Everyone working in June’s lab became cancer-world famous. (At a recent conference, a scientist who got up to speak after June told the audience he felt like he was “standing up to play the ukulele after the Rolling Stones.”)</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobon3001l3b8337l1tp4r@published" data-word-count="82">The biggest question in oncology today is whether this approach could also be used for solid tumors. Maus was one of dozens of specialists in immunotherapy who began looking for a suitable cancer for a new CAR-T trial. “I’m not an expert in any disease right now,” she told me, “but I think a lot about how to get T cells to do what we want them to do. The T cell is my hammer, and I’m on the lookout for nails.”</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobotp001m3b83s3saubtm@published" data-word-count="56">Glioblastoma, she knew, had a promising nail for the T-cell hammer: an antigen called epidermal-growth-factor-receptor variant III (EGFRvIII), which isn’t found in healthy brain tissue. In a clinical trial she began before moving to Mass General, she and a neurosurgeon at Penn named Donald O’Rourke gave patients intravenous injections of T cells engineered to target EGFRvIII.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobov5001n3b83gke5o4gd@published" data-word-count="85">The experiment was a failure. Some of the CAR-T cells made it to the patients’ brains, but they didn’t seem to have any effect on the tumor. By the time Maus set up her lab at Mass General in 2015, she had two ideas for how to improve the treatment, “one big one and one medium one.” The medium one was to infuse the T cells directly into the fluid surrounding the brain, which would, she hoped, allow more of them to reach the tumor.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjoboxu001o3b83lim1nfbm@published" data-word-count="91">The big idea was meant to address a separate problem. Glioblastoma, like most solid tumors, is heterogeneous. Different parts of the tumor have different proteins on the surface of their cells, which makes eliminating them by going after EGFRvIII alone impossible. Maus’s new CAR-T cell was engineered to secrete a molecule called a bispecific T-cell engager, which acted like a bit of double-sided tape, making it easier for T cells to bind to a second protein called wild-type EGFR. The approach, Maus said, was “as fine-tuned as I can possibly imagine.”</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjoboze001p3b83ouwnrpxp@published" data-word-count="43">Maus and Haber were at dinner when she showed him scans from the first patient. “The world stopped,” he said. The possibilities were immediately clear. “If it’s really working in glioblastoma,” he said, “does that open up the whole bandwidth of solid tumors?”</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobp1c001q3b83yoge5c9r@published" data-word-count="106">Maus was quick to point out the limits of what this first phase of the trial has proved. The modified T cells were remarkably effective, but they also eventually disappeared, probably killed by the body’s own immune system. Of the three patients, one died from a perforated bowel, an adverse reaction to a medication he was taking. The second had a recurrence within months of the tumor vanishing. And even Fraser, who had the longest-lasting response, has recently seen signs that his cancer is starting to grow again. “I feel like this was a double or a triple,” Maus told me. “It’s not a home run.”</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobp33001r3b83ngn8nlyh@published" data-word-count="74">June’s assessment was more sanguine. He compared Maus’s experiment to his celebrated work with leukemia. It took just five years to get from their first promising results to FDA approval; today, thousands of patients have been effectively cured. “I think by 2029, we’re going to have FDA approval of CAR-T cells for glioblastoma,” he said. “It’s going to be a huge thing, and 2024 is going to be looked at as the breakthrough year.”</p>

  

  

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobp6e001t3b830mp146pj@published" data-word-count="80">Cancer researchers are fluent in the language of failure. The past century, divided in half by Richard Nixon’s declaration of a war on cancer in 1971, has been marked by frustrations and setbacks, approaches that should have worked but didn’t. Oncologists once thought they were treating a single disease. Now they know that no two types of cancer are alike. Indeed, the same cancer in two individuals can be wildly different. “Cancer,” Haber told me, “is as complicated as medicine.”</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobp7t001u3b83bjpty7ss@published" data-word-count="68">For all the promise of immunotherapy, there are formidable obstacles. The first of these is cost. At Maus’s lab, every device and every person represents tightly coiled helixes of time and money. There are PCR machines, biosafety cabinets, ELISA readers, autoclaves, freezers, cell counters, incubators, and centrifuges. The proliferation of white, boxy machines makes the space look like an open-floor-plan office with an unusual number of personal mini-fridges.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobp9b001v3b83myzw5e98@published" data-word-count="85">When I visited, many of the researchers on the floor (there are dozens of them — young, a mix of genders and races) were staring at computers. Others were busy at what we’d recognizably call lab work, transferring liquids from one container to another, moving things in and out of freezers, placing things under a microscope or removing them. The lab itself carries Maus’s affect: friendly but solemn, collegial but not disposed to gossip or chitchat. Nearly everyone has an M.D., a Ph.D., or both.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobpat001w3b836u5vahmt@published" data-word-count="133">Maus walked me through some of the steps needed to create CAR-T cells for the trial. We started with the room where the DNA instructions that are added to the T cell’s genome are written. (“I ran my first restriction digest on a DNA plasmid the summer after eighth grade,” Maus told me. “I was so excited. I didn’t sleep for two days afterward.”) We went on to the lentiviral-production room, where technicians create viral vectors carrying this DNA. From there, we moved to the tissue-culture room, where the vector is mixed with normal T cells to create the CAR-T. Finally, we visited the immune-monitoring part of the lab, where lab techs assay blood draws and other samples from patients, looking for proof that the CAR-T cells have made it to their targets.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobpc8001x3b83u4wtlozk@published" data-word-count="51">Maus calls the lab “as whole shebang as you can get.” The only part missing are the mice they use for testing; those are upstairs. Maus says she’s glad of that — she’s allergic to mice. It takes this whole apparatus, working together, weeks to create enough T cells for one infusion.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobpe5001y3b834vrzc76z@published" data-word-count="82">Jennifer Wargo, a professor of genomic medicine at MD Anderson, referred to the cost of immunotherapy treatments as “financial toxicity.” The patent for June’s CAR-T therapy for leukemia is owned by Novartis, and the median cost for the treatment is $620,000. Even if drug companies don’t try to profit from these therapies, the process is inherently labor-intensive: T cells have to be removed from the patient’s own blood, genetically altered, then reinfused. It’s difficult to determine where economies of scale might kick in.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobpft001z3b83vdg1yq2p@published" data-word-count="129">The complicated process of producing CAR-T cells also limits the number of people who can be treated. For an emerging therapy like CAR-T for glioblastoma, the restrictions are even greater. Over the past few months, I spoke with several patients searching for a trial that would take them on. ​​Michael McNally was diagnosed last summer, after he noticed a slight droop on the left side of his face. He went to Mass General, suspecting a mild stroke. After an MRI, the doctor told him he had a tumor in his right frontal lobe. “I said, ‘Look, we’re changing the rules here at Mass General,’” McNally said. If a doctor delivered news like that, “you better have a Redbreast whiskey in your right hand.” He had surgery two days later.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobphm00203b83z65ziair@published" data-word-count="91">McNally has gone through an exhaustive list of treatments trying to improve on the standard of care, including a personalized cancer vaccine. “If someone told me scorpion poison would kill it, I’d probably take it,” he said. “I’m a giant mouse; let’s go. Let’s do it.” He won’t be able, however, to enroll in Maus’s trial. Because they want to ensure that any positive outcome can be attributed to the CAR-T regime alone, the exclusion criteria rule out anyone who has been treated with “any prior gene-therapy or gene-modified cellular therapy.”</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobpz000213b839yxrxnov@published" data-word-count="121">Timing can be difficult for patients and their families to manage. After her father, Yuriy, was diagnosed with glioblastoma, Yelena Tsyrlin tried to enroll him in an immunotherapy trial right away, but she still missed the eligibility window. (She has since started the process to secure a spot in O’Rourke’s follow-up study to the one he conducted with Maus, which has also shown promising results.) Another caregiver wrote that her mother kept getting rejected from trials because she was still on hormone therapy for breast cancer, which she’d had more than five years earlier. “I understand the reasoning and the science behind these decisions,” she wrote, “but when you’re facing this as a patient or a family member, it feels cruel.”</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobq0n00223b83cplwnqoe@published" data-word-count="39">None of the oncologists I spoke with thought that immunotherapy would completely supplant proven approaches. Some cancers will still be best treated by surgery, others by radiation or chemotherapy. CAR-T therapy may be reserved for the most stubborn cancers.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobq2f00233b83k28pty5b@published" data-word-count="105">As more CAR-T treatments get FDA approval, however, cost and efficiency may improve. “You’re on the incipient curve of discovery,” Haber said, “but science builds on itself, and sometimes things that are incredibly complicated, expensive, and dangerous open the door to things that become much more democratic, affordable, and standard.” Researchers are looking at ways to use a virus to genetically modify T cells inside a patient’s body, effectively eliminating half of the steps Maus walked me through in her lab. Others are experimenting with vaccines that can teach the immune system to target the same kind of antigens that the CAR-T cells bind to.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobq4600243b83azrc2fha@published" data-word-count="52">Maus and Choi have already refined the protocol for their glioblastoma trial. Patients will now have a short run of chemotherapy before the infusion to limit the number of CAR-T cells killed or inactivated by the innate immune system, allowing more of them to remain active at the tumor site for longer.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobq6d00253b83xjwi42th@published" data-word-count="88">In our first conversation, I asked Maus if Mass General hired her because of the incredible results from the CAR-T therapies developed at Penn. She said they weren’t hiring a CAR-T specialist; they were hiring a T-cell specialist. The difference was meaningful. The CAR-T cell, as complicated as it is, is one expression of a much deeper knowledge. That may be how we ultimately reduce costs: The better we understand the immune system, the easier it will be to find ways to make it do what we want.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobq9l00273b83rer56qh1@published" data-word-count="119">On the first day of summer, I went to visit Tom Fraser, participant No. 2 in the trial, at his home outside Rochester. I had been warned that the cancer had made speaking difficult for him, and all my phone communications to that point had been with his wife, Debbie. After spending months talking to patients with glioblastoma and their families, I feared the worst. So it was a pleasant surprise to be greeted at the door by a tall, sturdy man with a shock of salt-and-pepper hair. “Welcome,” he said, shaking my hand. “I’m Tom Fraser.” He led me to his tidy kitchen, where we sat and talked for nearly two hours. The sun outside was almost unbearably bright.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobqbe00283b83lzbls9cz@published" data-word-count="69">Before he retired, Tom led a forensic engineering firm. After some catastrophe, he’d be called in to determine its causes. When a Bethlehem Steel warehouse near Buffalo caught fire a few years ago, sending up a plume of smoke so large 300 households and several schools had to be evacuated, Tom determined that the culprit was an improperly installed lighting system that had thrown sparks onto flammable materials below.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobqm800293b83x390t02f@published" data-word-count="62">He takes the same methodical approach to discussing the course of his disease, consulting a timeline he’s marked out on a legal pad. “I put some dates down here just so I can remember,” he told me. Sometimes Debbie, voluble where Tom was laconic, with a neatly trimmed gray bob, would interject. Tom would pause to listen, then return to his outline.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobqnt002a3b836lzl5b0c@published" data-word-count="101">In August 2021, they were staying at their cottage in the Thousand Islands — a little white house perched on a rock in the Saint Lawrence River — when Tom first knew something was wrong. “I got up in the morning,” he said, “and I couldn’t read.” It took him a month to schedule an MRI, but once he did, the diagnosis arrived quickly. He’d never heard of glioblastoma, but his doctor was direct with him: Without treatment, he could die within six months. He and Debbie told their family — four daughters and eight grandchildren — the news over Zoom.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobqpi002b3b837cn3ou51@published" data-word-count="63">One of Tom’s daughters works as a physician’s assistant at Mass General, and she encouraged him to travel there to get his tumor resected. His surgeon, Brian Nahed, needed nearly five hours to complete the operation. Tom showed me the scar, a horseshoe on the left side of his head. “It’s okay as long as I can comb my hair over it,” he said.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobqr9002c3b83h3uganvx@published" data-word-count="88">After the surgery, he started radiation and chemotherapy, then underwent treatment by Optune, a device that uses electric fields to try to disrupt cell division. Nahed was frank about the likelihood of any of these approaches keeping the cancer in remission for long. “He said, ‘That’ll work until it doesn’t work,’” Debbie told me. “‘This is what happens. This heterogeneous cancer figures out ways. That’s what makes it so aggressive and so difficult to treat.’” Even so, when the cancer recurred after 20 months, the Frasers felt blindsided.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobqsq002d3b83f4fxxhys@published" data-word-count="61">It was Nahed who suggested Tom enroll in the trial being run by his colleagues at Mass General, calling the Frasers at dinner on a Sunday night in the spring of 2023. His message was one of both caution and hope: There was no guarantee this treatment would work, but there was also no more promising trial anywhere in the world.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobqui002e3b83tmkjgajw@published" data-word-count="61">On the day of the infusion in July 2023, 30 people crowded into the room with Tom and Debbie to watch. For all the time and money and innovation that went into producing that moment, the scene was oddly humble: a normal hospital room, Tom sitting up in his bed as a doctor wearing gloves pushed the plunger on a syringe.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobqwz002f3b83uvvnjqt5@published" data-word-count="105">The next month was difficult. Even though the scans showed the tumor shrinking, matching the dramatic results from the first patient, the doctors were reluctant to read too much into them. “They really were very careful not to give us information, even though we were asking all the time,” Debbie said. In the weeks that followed, Tom suffered a cascade of complications: atrial fibrillation, mysterious infections, a punishing fever. The nurses swaddled him in blanket after blanket, but still he shook uncontrollably. Debbie kept watch 12 hours a day. Choi tried to reassure them that the effects were a sign that the treatment was working.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobqyp002g3b83xmz7cjhh@published" data-word-count="72">“By the time I left,” Tom said, “I could hardly walk.” Debbie showed me a picture from that day. Tom looked feeble and miserable, “not himself,” in her words. “Let me see that,” Tom said, and Debbie turned the picture to him. “Oh,” he said. “That <em>is</em> not myself.” When they arrived back in New York, the grandchildren greeted them with a WELCOME HOME poster, a hand-drawn rainbow floating near the bottom.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobr0s002h3b83uwx7ojev@published" data-word-count="80">That fall, Tom felt strong enough to return to the family’s cottage in the Thousand Islands. He wanted to help power-wash the house, but Debbie overruled him. They knew nothing about participants Nos. 1 and 3 in the trial and precious little about Tom’s own prognosis. “We knew that things were stable, but we did not know the profound results,” Debbie said. That all changed when Maus and her team published the paper in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine.</em></p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobr2e002i3b83ft4kthnp@published" data-word-count="76">If CAR-T therapy for glioblastoma eventually becomes standard of care — if Maus and others can reproduce and improve on the results she got for Tom Fraser — his name will forever be tied with the birth of this treatment. “I shouldn’t say it, but I’m a little proud of myself,” Tom said. “There were three of us in the group, the first three to ever have it and try it. And I was the No. 2 guy.”</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobr9t002j3b8358gcqyz2@published" data-word-count="123">Hope can be a shot of adrenaline or the steady drip of an IV, but it’s always strong medicine. The intense days of those first incredible scans are long behind the Frasers; they have settled into a different rhythm recently, something approximating the way they were before the diagnosis. Tom has also shifted the way he talks about his disease. For years, he spoke about beating glioblastoma — finding a cure for himself. Now he’s more likely to refer to the patients who come after him, who will undoubtedly live longer because of what we’ve learned from his response to the CAR-T therapy. This spring, he packed up his library of engineering reference books and donated them to Clarkson College, his alma mater.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobrbf002k3b83pvufypo3@published" data-word-count="102">He might not be done with his fight yet, however. After a scan in February showed signs of recurrence, a new set of images taken in June showed just the opposite. The tumor had seemingly shrunk again. “I said, ‘Holy crap, I’m going to do a dance,’” Tom said. Now, according to Debbie, he’s in better shape than he’s been in months. Was it a temporary effect or a sign that the T cells were still active in his brain? We may only know years from now, and then only by implication, if a strong enough signal emerges from future CAR-T trials.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="nymag.com/intelligencer/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clyjobrd1002l3b83q3tbxm5c@published" data-word-count="83">Tom’s next scan is not till August. In the meantime, he told me about a trip he and Debbie were planning: “I’ve never visited Chicago in my life. I said, ‘This is nuts. I want to see this place — so let’s go.’” That morning, they had been to their youngest grandson’s fifth-grade graduation. It was a hot day, and they sat sweating in the parking lot. It had been almost three years since he’d been told he might have six months to live.</p>

Their idea at the time was to invest in Web 2.0, meaning the nascent world of web apps. They built a few products at the time. One was an online classified ad service called Edge.io that was supposed to mimic Craigslist on every site on the web. The other was a startup tracking service called TechCrunch that aimed to review every Web 2.0 site popping up on the nascent Internet. Teare, for his part, focused on the startup while Arrington focused on the blog.</span></p><p><span>At the time, the media industry was being upended by bloggers who moved faster and wrote off-the-cuff stories about nearly everything, essentially beating print magazines to every punch. Along the way, they destroyed the </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2008/12/17/death-to-the-embargo/" rel="">embargo system</a><span>, built the first influencers, gave rise to </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kara_Swisher" rel="">hagiographic access journalism</a><span>, turned true reviews into affiliate marketing plays, savaged advertising revenue, and threw traditional journalism into a death spiral whose crash is currently finalizing itself around the world. But, at the time, they were pretty cool.</span></p><p>Arrington spent most of his waking hours publishing Web 2.0 stories and asking his VC buddies for scoops. He monetized the site by selling square ads on the side of the page for a few thousand dollars a month, and emblazoned there were early come-ons for the same sites Arrington was reviewing. Eventually, those sponsors paid enough money to expand the site into multiple topics, including MobileCrunch and my site, CrunchGear.</p><p>I started CrunchGear for Mike in 2006. At this point, TechCrunch had eclipsed most of the rest of Archimedes Ventures, leaving Arrington to spend nearly every waking hour on TC. To cater to a global audience, he would stay up until three or four writing scoops about exciting new services like TWTR and Spotify and yelling loudly at Mark Hendrickson, a recent college grad who was imprisoned in Mike’s Palo Alto home. When I came by for my initial interview, I had to wake Mike up and he took me to CostCo to buy stuff for a party he was holding that night.</p><p>If you want to understand what life was like back then, blogger Om Malik suffered a heart attack from overwork (and too many cigars) while Arrington himself told the NYT that his lifestyle was awful:</p><p><em><span>“I haven’t died yet,” said Michael Arrington, the founder and co-editor of </span><a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/" rel="">TechCrunch</a><span>, a popular technology blog. The site has brought in millions in advertising revenue, but there has been a hefty cost. Mr. Arrington says he has gained 30 pounds in the last three years, developed a severe sleeping disorder and turned his home into an office for him and four employees. “At some point, I’ll have a nervous breakdown and be admitted to the hospital, or something else will happen.”</span></em></p><p><em>“This is not sustainable,” he said.</em></p><p>TechCrunch was the definitive startup news site. To get on the front page - however briefly - meant 10,000 new signups to your service and countless calls from Valley VCs. That was TC’s power: it could make or break a site. This gave us silly kids an inordinate amount of power (and eventually led me to suffer a fairly debilitating depression) because startup founders needed us to close out their rounds. “Get a TC story,” the VCs would say, and founders would listen. One pair of Dutch entrepreneurs walked into Mike’s house with coffee, entering his bedroom in hopes of convincing him to write about whatever they were flogging. Legend has it that at one point an irate German entrepreneur spit on Mike at an event, leading us all to have a profound distrust of humanity.</p><p>The site flourished during the Web 3.0 and Mobile Web days and settled into a routine of startup news speckled with more hard-hitting investigations on privacy and hardware. It spawned the best startup event on the planet, Disrupt, and essentially defined how to pitch for tens of thousands of entrepreneurs. I personally ran pitch-offs around the world in bars and concert halls as a sort of scouting mechanism for TC. When I was doing this, during the early 2010s, TC was already becoming insular and SF-focused.</p><p>After the Great Recession, however, global startups and local U.S. startup hubs began producing some interesting things. The San Francisco-focused writers often ignored these startups simply because they didn’t get that innovation could happen anywhere outside of the Mission. I called myself the East Coast Editor and said that my beat was everything outside San Francisco.</p><p>This was TC’s first mistake.</p><p>To populate Disrupt with startups, it needed to bring in hopefuls from outside the Valley. Sure, you could bring Zuckerberg up from Palo Alto to speak, but smaller companies from places like Paris, Chicago, and Tel Aviv were the real customers. These folks, ignored by nearly everyone, felt they could get a fair hearing at Disrupt and on the pages of TechCrunch. Little did they know that the SF crew mostly cared about Uber’s next round of investment, while folks like myself and Mike Butcher brought the TC gospel to people who yearned to be noticed.</p><p>This effort turned into a grind. I’d fly into a city, get to the hotel, eat and drink too much, and then get cornered for five hours at an event where I drank even more. We’d hold a pitch-off with a few local startups and VCs and then run around Yount or Dizengoff Street until the wee hours, drunk on gin and tonics and power. We were kingmakers, after all.</p><p>This was TC’s second mistake.</p><p>TC squandered this power. The SF crew, now run by AOL and Yahoo overlords, were focused on everything except startups. Traffic was paramount and ad sales were vital, so niche startup posts, posts that everyone once read but were now read by the company, lost their value. Over time, the value of a traditional TC story waned. Sites liked ProductHunt - which the bosses at TC were thinking of buying - eclipsed the power of a TC post. PR got expensive, so companies used guerrilla tactics to raise their user counts and more cash. VCs grew more savvy and created their own pitch-offs and accelerators to build bigger portfolios. The kingmakers were no longer in charge. Further, mainstream news was covering startups, too, focusing on cool new sites and gadgets.</p><p>As an aside, have you ever wondered why gadget sites suck now? You can thank the guy who replaced me at Gizmodo before I started CrunchGear, Brian Lam. Lam hit on the exciting concept that he should be paid for every widget one of his reviews sold, which led to affiliate marketing and, in turn, turned gadget review sites into churnalistic slop. In fact, his concept, one that ravaged sites like Engadget and CrunchGear, is directly responsible for the fact that outlets like New York Magazine were writing SEO-larded reviews of audio soundbars and TVs so they could get a 2% cut on every sale. Afflicting the comfortable, indeed.</p><p><span>But one thing TC always had was an edge. Arrington was often gleefully mean to startups that didn't live up to their promises. He called out Twitter for being down and essentially invented the “</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2008/04/06/comcast-twitter-and-the-chicken-trust-me-i-have-a-point/" rel="">complain on social media</a><span>” method of getting better customer service. At CrunchGear, we skewered things we thought were bad, called out bad actors, and did awful stuff like having Hitler complain about a new, overhyped tablet being late to </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/01/24/hitler-discusses-the-notion-ink-adam-delays/#!" rel="">market</a><span>:</span></p><div id="youtube2-js7awHyFwKI" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;js7awHyFwKI&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/js7awHyFwKI?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><p>All that went away as bosses from Yahoo tried to understand how to milk even more cash out of TC’s events division while shutting down its multimedia efforts. Editor Matthew Panzarino did an admirable job of negotiating those shoals by keeping the suits out of the organization, but after he left they rushed in to fill Panzer’s glad-handing void. The result is TC’s third and final mistake.</p><p>After years of corporate ownership, culminating in Yahoo’s sale to private equity firm Apollo, TC has become a milquetoast site focused on big raises specially placed by expensive PR people and random tech news that has been neutered into pablum. The current editorial structure, controlled by one or two old-guard TCers and a lot of older editors hired by editor Connie Loizos. The once-freewheeling editorial strategy - writers wrote what they wanted at any time and nobody really edited anything - is being replaced by a more formalized system familiar to those who are one job away from become PR people themselves, while any hint of anger against the current crop of boy-kings in SF is dealt with harshly.</p><p><span>This all leads to what happened recently at TC. </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hjkamps/overlay/about-this-profile/" rel="">Haje Kamps</a><span> (who was, incidentally, running a side business advising startups, something that would have gotten him canned in previous incarnations of TC but was ignored because the wall between VC and editorial has been worn down to a nub) wrote about the lie of Alexandr Wang’s take on DEI vs. meritocracy. In a post that has since been toned down, Haje argued that Wang was a wang.</span></p><p><em><span>I just came off recording an </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/podcast/ai-powered-drug-development-vw-teams-up-with-rivian-and-dei-is-bad/" rel="">episode of Equity</a><span>, where I learned about the newest wave of stupidity. The tech industry’s DEI allergy has hit a new low, as Silicon Valley leaders are once again waving their “meritocracy” banners high and wide. Scale AI’s Alexandr Wang has decided that diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) are passé — and replaced them with his shiny new acronym MEI: merit, excellence, and intelligence. I cringed so hard I’m going to need a chiropractor.</span></em></p><p>DEI has long been a dangerous thing in the valley, primarily because the Valley is primarily run by white dudes. These white dudes, who got lucky once or twice and are worth billions, think everyone could be like them with just a little elbow grease and grit. After all, little Mark Zuckerberg pulled himself up by his bootstraps while hanging out in the dorms at Harvard and poor Travis Kalanick invented Uber when he was having a hard time finding a cab to go to a party in Paris. Meanwhile, the only notable entrepreneur to do jail time for defrauding investors was Elizabeth Holmes and the African-American founders of MoviePass were pushed out of the company by a lucky white dude.</p><p><span>White dude CEOs like </span><a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coinbase-is-a-mission-focused-company" rel="">Brian Armstrong</a><span> and Jesse Powell came out hard against DEI efforts and even </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/kraken-crypto-ceo-jesse-powell-does-not-regret-offending-anyone-2022-7" rel="">paid employees to leave,</a><span> which led, incidentally, to morale at their companies so low it could be measured in millisieverts. But they were making money, baby, so it was all good.</span></p><p>So, by all measures, Alexandr Wang’s MEI bullshit was just that, bullshit. And Haje, speaking in a voice that once rang out of the old TechCrunch like a clarion, called him out. The resulting Twitter backlash spooked Loizos and Haje was dumped from the roster a few months after another group of OG TCers, including Catherine Shu, Matt Burns, and Darrell Etherington - were laid off. This trio alone were responsible for a good percentage of TC’s global traffic because they were still writing interesting things and had been for nearly two decades. Also laid off was a large number of the marketing team. In short, TC is contracting and getting scared.</p><p>Loizos has to earn out her buy-out, and her new editors, refugees from the great business news layoffs of the 2020s, are hungry to stay relevant. The site itself is global, but news sits on the page for hours instead of minutes, and the value of the site is in the toilet.</p><p><span>I talk to VCs and startup founders all the time on </span><a href="https://keepgoingpod.com/" rel="">Keep Going</a><span> and all of them say the same thing: they don’t read TC. The value to their businesses is simply gone, and the current story roster - from press releases like </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/12/capcut-will-stop-offering-free-cloud-storage-from-august-5/" rel="">CapCut</a><span> making a policy change to </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/10/facebook-to-face-of-crypto-anthony-pompliano-wild-career/" rel="">glowing VC interviews</a><span> with some of the same odious men who believe in MEI - is junk. There are still plenty of people I consider friends and confidants on staff, and I know not every story is garbage. Sometimes </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/12/a-vc-told-keely-cat-wells-to-get-a-male-able-bodied-co-founder-she-balked-nabbed-a-2m-seed-round/" rel="">gold still shines through</a><span> (but even in this case the article is too long by half, something one of those vaunted editors should have caught). But in the end, TC is no longer relevant.</span></p><p>Here’s the saddest thing: it should be. Startups haven’t gone away. Any media startup could essentially recreate Arrington’s model and start selling little ads while profiling startups. Fun can be had poking holes in Valley blowhards, and there could be reams of content to be had by telling people how to be successful in startup land. But TC won’t do that anymore. It is stuck, churning through releases from the same pushy Valley PR people and thinking they’re doing good work when they simply aren’t.</p><p>What would I do? Bring back a global focus to startup coverage, ignore the PR people flogging minor updates to already popular services, and become the place where VCs go to figure out where to invest. This was TC’s original magic. By reducing the editors, who are currently awash in posts and unable to keep up, to give TC back some of its vitality. And they’d get bonus points for making money from events again and pulling themselves out from under the boulder of private equity.</p><p>I don’t write those words without sadness. Knowing what could have been had TC not climbed up its own backside makes me mad. An industry that once grew and changed and embraced nearly everyone before contracting into a black hole of Valley douchery is now holding the reins to its only source of criticism and celebration. TC isn’t a news site. It’s a corpse.</p><p>That’s its final failure.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            </div>
          <p>On Saturday, six days into the general strike by the National Samsung Electronics Union (NSEU), someone in the KakaoTalk group chat operated by striking union members who work on the 8-inch semiconductor production line at Samsung’s Giheung plant posted a photo of their thumb, which has become deformed from their work. &nbsp;</p><p>“My thumb is becoming deformed,” the worker wrote. “My thumb is a badge of honor from the 8-inch production line.”</p><p>Workers on this production line are known not only for their deformed fingers but for a laundry list of physical ailments such as varicose veins, plantar fasciitis, and slipped discs. Employees posted numerous messages and photos about their conditions in the group chat.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the NSEU, the 8-inch semiconductor production line was operating at a mere 18% capacity on July 8, the first day of the strike. Normally, the line operates at 80% capacity. Women in their 20s, 30s and 40s who make up the lion’s share of the workers on the line are actively involved in the strike. All too acquainted with on-the-job injuries, these women told the Hankyoreh that pay raises and more days off aren’t their top concern.</p><p>“We just don’t want to be treated as disposable parts.”&nbsp;</p><p>In response to our inquiries about worker safety, a Samsung Electronics spokesperson replied, “We obey all work site safety standards dictated by the Occupational Safety and Health Act.”</p><p>“In spite of the strike, we are still meeting our production quotas, and are drafting countermeasures to ensure that there are no problems going forward,” the spokesperson added.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>“We are machines”</strong></p><p>The 8-inch production line at Samsung’s Giheung plant is a foundry that produces 8-inch silicon wafers. A wafer is a thin slice of semiconductor, such as crystalline silicon, used for the fabrication of integrated circuits. These wafers are used in the manufacturing of automobiles and various home appliances.&nbsp;</p><p>Samsung’s 12-inch line utilizes an overhead hoist transport (OHT) system, an automated transport network that operates along tracks installed on the ceiling, to move bundles of 25 wafers called “lots.” On the 8-inch line, however, this transportation is done manually. There is much more market demand for 12-inch wafers, so Samsung has modernized and automated many processes. The 8-inch line, however, is outdated. This is the same production line where two employees were exposed to X-ray radiation this past May.&nbsp;</p><p>Workers on this line manually transport the lots, which weigh between 3 and 5 kilograms, and feed them into machinery that completes the manufacturing process and spits them back out. That’s what these workers do, over and over for eight hours a day, on their feet the whole time. The work deforms their fingers and wrecks their legs with varicose veins. A worker identified as “A” is in her 15th year of employment on this production line. She rotates between three shifts: 6 am, 2 pm, and 10 pm.&nbsp;</p><p>“Technically, we get an hour for lunch, but the machinery never stops operating, so someone has to fill that spot at all times,” Worker A added.&nbsp;</p><p>“We’re so busy we can’t even eat or go to the bathroom without stressing out.”</p><p>Worker B is in her 25th year on the line.&nbsp;</p><p>“After suffering from a severe bladder infection, I no longer drink water before work, and I don’t even look at coffee,” she said.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>The company sets production quotas, and every group is evaluated based on performance, adding psychological pressure to the grueling physical labor.&nbsp;</p><p>“When someone is exempt from overtime due to a pregnancy, they don’t send anyone in their place, which means those of us left on the line just have to do more work,” said Worker A. &nbsp;</p><p>“I was diagnosed with depression and even admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. Many of my colleagues also suffer from depression.”&nbsp;</p><p>In response to such testimonies, the Samsung spokesperson replied, “We operate a preventative musculoskeletal exercise center and a health enhancement room to promote the health of our line workers.”</p><p>“We strictly adhere to the standards outlined in the Occupational Safety and Health Act regarding the musculoskeletal health of our workers,” the spokesperson added.</p><p>“There is no evidence to suggest that sickness or injury rates on the 8-inch are higher than other production lines, and there have been no applications for workers’ compensation for industrial accidents from that line.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>“Can’t take a break even if we want to”</strong></p><p>For night shift workers, who deal with disrupted circadian rhythms, days off are essential. Yet a shortage of workers makes vacation days just numbers on paper. Workers don’t dare to actually take a day off.&nbsp;</p><p>Worker C, who started working for Samsung in 2010 and has spent most of her time on the 8-inch line, said, “Other departments apparently have to use their mandatory PTO, but when we schedule days off, we have to do a lottery.”</p><p>Worker D, who is in her 15th year at the company, said, “Even if we get new employees, many of them can’t handle the night shifts and quit, so we’re always shorthanded.”</p><p>“If too many people want to use their vacation days, we have to play rock, paper, scissors to decide who gets to,” Worker D said.</p><p>When questioned about this issue, the Samsung spokesperson said, “The claim that employees are restricted from using their vacation days is a one-sided one made by only a handful of employees.”&nbsp;</p><p>Many of the workers on the 8-inch line graduated from specialized vocational and trade high schools. They have endured their working conditions by telling themselves they work for a “top global corporation.” Now, they are joining the NSEU strike to make a statement: Don’t treat us like machine components.</p><p>Worker E, who is in her 15th year at the company, said the strike is “a part of the process of finding a way to prevent the harmful practices of the 8-inch line from being passed on, a way to change them.”&nbsp;</p><p>“The reality is that the company is ignoring the words of the union, so I decided I couldn’t just stand by and watch,” she said.&nbsp;</p><p>This is the first general strike in Samsung Electronics’ 55-year history, and it appears likely that the forewarned setbacks to production quotas may become a reality.

            <span>Abstract:</span>The enduring legacy of Euclidean geometry underpins classical machine learning, which, for decades, has been primarily developed for data lying in Euclidean space. Yet, modern machine learning increasingly encounters richly structured data that is inherently nonEuclidean. This data can exhibit intricate geometric, topological and algebraic structure: from the geometry of the curvature of space-time, to topologically complex interactions between neurons in the brain, to the algebraic transformations describing symmetries of physical systems. Extracting knowledge from such non-Euclidean data necessitates a broader mathematical perspective. Echoing the 19th-century revolutions that gave rise to non-Euclidean geometry, an emerging line of research is redefining modern machine learning with non-Euclidean structures. Its goal: generalizing classical methods to unconventional data types with geometry, topology, and algebra. In this review, we provide an accessible gateway to this fast-growing field and propose a graphical taxonomy that integrates recent advances into an intuitive unified framework. We subsequently extract insights into current challenges and highlight exciting opportunities for future development in this field.

There is a discrepancy of about 10 dB between the experimental and simulated data in the level of the power response from the lunar surface. This implies that the simulator, as expected, is correctly estimating the scattering contribution from the pit, but underestimating the diffuse scattering contribution from the lunar surface by about 10 dB. However, this does not affect the general validity of the results. The large negative peak of the simulations corresponds to the interior of the pit.

												<p>At least a dozen organizations with domain names at domain registrar <strong>Squarespace</strong> saw their websites hijacked last week. Squarespace bought all assets of <strong>Google Domains</strong> a year ago, but many customers still haven’t set up their new accounts. Experts say malicious hackers learned they could commandeer any migrated Squarespace accounts that hadn’t yet been registered, merely by supplying an email address tied to an existing domain.</p>

In some cases, the attackers were able to redirect the hijacked domains to phishing sites set up to steal visitors’ cryptocurrency funds.</p>
<p>New York City-based <a href="https://www.squarespace.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Squarespace</a> purchased roughly 10 million domain names from Google Domains in June 2023, and it has been gradually migrating those domains to its service ever since. Squarespace has not responded to a request for comment, nor has it issued a statement about the attacks.</p>
<p>But an analysis released by security experts at <a href="https://metamask.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metamask</a> and <a href="https://x.com/samczsun/status/1811367830564307451" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paradigm</a> finds the most likely explanation for what happened is that Squarespace assumed all users migrating from Google Domains would select the social login options — such “Continue with Google” or “Continue with Apple” — as opposed to the “Continue with email” choice.</p>
<p><strong>Taylor Monahan</strong>, lead product manager at Metamask, said Squarespace never accounted for the possibility that a threat actor might sign up for an account using an email associated with a recently-migrated domain before the legitimate email holder created the account themselves.</p>
<p>“Thus nothing actually stops them from trying to login with an email,” Monahan told KrebsOnSecurity. “And since there’s no password on the account, it just shoots them to the ‘create password for your new account’ flow. And since the account is half-initialized on the backend, they now have access to the domain in question.”</p>
<p>What’s more, Monahan said, Squarespace did not require email verification for new accounts created with a password.</p>
<p>“The domains being migrated from Google to Squarespace are known,” Monahan said. “It’s either public or easily discernible info which email addresses have admin of a domain. And if that email never sets up their account on Squarespace — say because the billing admin left the company five years ago or folks just ignored the email — anyone who enters that email@domain in the squarespace form now has full access to control to the domain.”<span id="more-68067"></span></p>
<p>The researchers say some Squarespace domains that were migrated over also could be hijacked if attackers discovered the email addresses for less privileged user accounts tied to the domain, such as “domain manager,” which likewise has the ability to transfer a domain or point it to a different Internet address.</p>
<div id="attachment_68074"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-68074" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/squarespaceusers.png" alt="" width="750" height="822"></p><p id="caption-attachment-68074">Squarespace says domain owners and domain managers have many of the same privileges, including the ability to move a domain or manage the site’s domain name server (DNS) settings.</p></div>
<p>Monahan said the migration has left domain owners with fewer options to secure and monitor their accounts.</p>
<p>“Squarespace can’t support users who need any control or insight into the activity being performed in their account or domain,” Monahan said. “You basically have no control over the access different folks have. You don’t have any audit logs. You don’t get email notifications for some actions. The owner doesn’t get email notification for actions taken by a ‘domain manager.’ This is absolutely insane if you’re used to and expecting the controls Google provides.”</p>
<p>The researchers have published <a href="https://securityalliance.notion.site/A-Squarespace-Retrospective-or-How-to-Coordinate-an-Industry-Wide-Incident-Response-fead693b66c14543a48283d85aec19ad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a comprehensive guide</a> for locking down Squarespace user accounts, which urges Squarespace users to enable multi-factor authentication (disabled during the migration).</p>
<p>“Determining what emails have access to your new Squarespace account is step 1,” the help guide advises. “Most teams DO NOT REALIZE these accounts even exist, let alone theoretically have access.”</p>
<p>The guide also recommends removing unnecessary Squarespace user accounts, and disabling reseller access in Google Workspace.</p>
<p>“If you bought Google Workspace via Google Domains, Squarespace is now your authorized reseller,” the help document explains. “This means that anyone with access to your Squarespace account also has a backdoor into your Google Workspace unless you explicitly disable it by following the instructions here, which you should do. It’s easier to secure one account than two.”</p>

        <p>In 1904, a widow named <a href="https://digitalcommons.law.buffalo.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1014&amp;context=journal_articles">Elizabeth Peck</a> had her portrait taken at a studio in a small Iowa town. The photographer sold the negatives to Duffy’s Pure Malt Whiskey, a company that avoided liquor taxes for years by <a href="https://digitalchicagohistory.org/items/show/677">falsely advertising</a> its product as medicinal. Duffy’s ads claimed the fantastical: that it cured everything from influenza to consumption, that it was endorsed by clergymen, that it could help you live until the age of 106. The portrait of Peck ended up in one of these <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/214/185">dubious ads</a>, published in newspapers across the country alongside what appeared to be her <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-spokane-press-too-funny-to-not-clip/32975454/">unqualified praise</a>: “After years of constant use of your Pure Malt Whiskey, both by myself and as given to patients in my capacity as nurse, I have no hesitation in recommending it.”</p>

<p>Duffy’s lies were numerous. Peck (misleadingly identified as “Mrs. A. Schuman”) was not a nurse, and she had not spent years constantly slinging back malt beverages. In fact, she fully abstained from alcohol. Peck never consented to the ad.</p>

<p>The camera’s first great age—which began in <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/invention-snapshot-changed-way-we-viewed-world-180952435/">1888</a> when <a href="https://www.kodak.com/en/company/page/george-eastman-history/">George Eastman</a> debuted the Kodak—is full of stories like this one. Beyond the wonders of a quickly developing art form and technology lay widespread lack of control over one’s own image, perverse incentives to make a quick buck, and generalized fear at the prospect of humiliation and the invasion of privacy.</p>

<p>Prior to 1888, cameras often existed in a realm of mystical unknowability. In one famed <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/490042?searchText=&amp;searchUri=&amp;ab_segments=&amp;searchKey=&amp;refreqid=fastly-default%3A4f12142dae9e22e72de48c8194abc75c">story</a> from the early days of photography, a man asks for a picture of his recently buried wife, not understanding that someone must be present in order to be photographed. The French writer Honoré de Balzac <a href="https://blogs.loc.gov/teachers/2018/09/pre-civil-war-photographic-technologies-the-calotype-and-daguerreotype/">confessed</a> to fearing that each time a daguerreotype was taken of him, a layer of his skin would be peeled off. Early cameras required a level of technical mastery that evoked mystery—a scientific instrument understood only by professionals.</p>

<p>All of that changed when Eastman invented flexible roll film and debuted the first Kodak camera. Instead of developing their own pictures, customers could mail their devices to the Kodak factory and have their rolls of film developed, printed, and replaced. “You press the button,” Kodak ads <a href="https://www.cameramuseum.ch/en/discover/permanent-exhibition/the-century-of-the-film/you-press-the-button-we-do-the-rest/">promised</a>, “we do the rest.” This leap from obscure science to streamlined service forever transformed the nature of looking and being looked at.</p>

<p>By 1905, less than 20 years after the first Kodak camera debuted, Eastman’s company had <a href="https://www.upress.virginia.edu/title/1967/">sold</a> 1.2 million devices and persuaded nearly a third of the United States’ population to take up photography. Kodak’s record-setting yearly ad spending—$750,000 by the end of the 19th century (roughly $28 million in today’s dollars)—and the rapture of a technology that scratched a timeless itch facilitated the onset of a new kind of mass exposure.</p>

<p>“The impulse to peer into others’ affairs—an age-old feature of village life—had never actually subsided,” writes historian <a href="https://as.vanderbilt.edu/history/bio/sarah-igo/">Sarah E. Igo</a> in <em><a href="https://amzn.to/4cq10GK"><em>The Known Citizen: A History of Privacy in Modern America</em></a></em>. Photography became such a phenomenon that “<a href="https://historicpittsburgh.org/islandora/object/pitt:20100623-ocl-1093">Kodak fiends</a>,” a phrase used to describe those seduced by the devilish pleasures of photography, entered the vernacular.</p>

<p>No one quite knew what to make of or how to control the fiendishness, and privacy was further unspooled by money-making schemes just as ferociously inventive as the new technology.</p>

<p>The same year Kodak cameras hit the marketplace, the<em> </em><a href="https://bklyn.newspapers.com/article/the-brooklyn-daily-eagle/1768668/"><em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em></a><em> </em>reported that Anthony Comstock—the anti-obscenity crusader after whom the 1873 <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/comstock-act-transform-abortion-debate-180982363/">Comstock Act</a> is named—had arrested an amateur photographer for selling manually photoshopped pictures that placed “the heads of innocent women on the undraped bodies of other females.” In 1890, a mugshot photographer for the New York Police Department was fired for selling copies of the mugshots to arrestees themselves—an arrangement the<em> </em><a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1890/08/03/106040745.html?pageNumber=15"><em>New York Times</em></a> described as a “lucrative business.” Boundless <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/how-camera-introduced-americans-their-heroines-180972526/">fascination</a> with photographs <a href="https://lawcat.berkeley.edu/record/379994">created</a> a bustling economy. People bought and collected random photographs from dry goods stores, general junk shops, vending machines and even cigarette packs. Demand was so robust that amateurs were just as able to sell to this market as professionals.</p>

<p>The ubiquity of advertising by the end of the 19th century only intensified this demand. “As the growth in productive capacity outpaced the needs of the population, commercial entrepreneurs became obsessed with creating demand for consumer products,” writes historian <a href="https://www.law.buffalo.edu/faculty/facultyDirectory/barbasSamantha.html">Samantha Barbas</a> in <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3W89759">Laws of Image: Privacy and Publicity in America</a></em>. “The key agent in this project was advertising.”</p>

<p>By 1900, photography began to replace earlier image-making methods as the ad technology of choice. Photos of women were especially desirable, given their association with respectability and the belief that a pretty face could sell anything. But dominant values around modesty, avoiding indulgence and anti-consumerism meant that most people had no desire to be featured in an advertisement. Commercial modeling and stock photos did not yet exist. Faced with few choices, advertisers resorted to backdoor purchases. In an arrangement Barbas dubs “the crisis of the ‘circulating portrait,’” advertisers began buying portraits from photographers without the permission of the photos’ subjects—as was the case with Peck, temperate widow turned whiskey hound by the magic and obfuscation of advertising.</p>

<p>It wasn’t just ordinary people who found themselves newly exposed. Mass photography was an equalizer twice over: Nearly anybody could use a camera, and nearly anybody might be violated by one. To their grave displeasure, even the elite were unable to assert control over the frenzy. The <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1903/04/12/101988760.html?pageNumber=6"><em>New York Times</em></a> reported that President Theodore Roosevelt was “known to exhibit impatience on discovering designs to Kodak him”; the same column mentioned that Reginald Claypoole Vanderbilt horsewhipped a man he alleged took a picture of him without permission.</p>

<p>Though newspapers across the country <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2712965">cautioned</a> Americans to “beware the Kodak,” as the cameras were “deadly weapons” and “deadly little boxes,” many were also primary facilitators of the craze. The perfection of halftone printing coincided with the rise of the Kodak and allowed for the mass circulation of images. Newly empowered, newspapers regularly published paparazzi pictures of famous people taken without their knowledge, paying twice as much for them as they did for consensual photos taken in a studio.</p>

<p>Lawmakers and judges responded to the crisis clumsily. Suing for libel was usually the only remedy available to the overexposed. But libel law did not protect against your likeness being taken or used without your permission unless the violation was also defamatory in some way. Though results were middling, one failed lawsuit gained enough notoriety to channel cross-class feelings of exposure into action. A teenage girl named <a href="https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/local/columnists/memmott/2019/01/15/abigail-roberson-privacy/2577870002/">Abigail Roberson</a> noticed her face on a neighbor’s bag of flour, only to learn that the Franklin Mills Flour Company had used her likeness in an ad that had been plastered 25,000 times all over her hometown.</p>

<p>After suffering intense shock and being temporarily bedridden, she sued. In 1902, the New York Court of Appeals rejected her claims and held that the right to privacy did not exist in common law. It based its decision in part on the assertion that the image was not libelous; Chief Justice Alton B. Parker wrote that the photo was “a very good one” that others might even regard as a “compliment to their beauty.” The humiliation, the lack of control over her own image, the unwanted fame—none of that amounted to any sort of actionable claim.</p>

<p>Public outcry at the decision reached a fever pitch, and newspapers <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/article/democrat-and-chronicle/23312379/">filled</a> <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/article/democrat-and-chronicle/23312417/">their pages</a> with editorial indignation. In its first legislative session following the court’s decision and the ensuing outrage, the New York state legislature <a href="https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3414&amp;context=faculty_scholarship">made history</a> by adopting a narrow “right to privacy,” which prohibited the use of someone’s likeness in advertising or trade without their written consent. Soon after, the Supreme Court of Georgia became the first to <a href="https://casetext.com/case/pavesich-v-new-england-life-ins-co">recognize</a> this category of privacy claim. Eventually, just about every state court in the country followed Georgia’s lead. The early uses and abuses of the Kodak helped cobble together a right that centered on profiting from the exploitation of someone’s likeness, rather than the exploitation itself.</p>

<p>Not long after asserting that no right to privacy exists in common law, and while campaigning to be the Democratic nominee for president, Parker told the Associated Press, “I reserve the right to put my hands in my pockets and assume comfortable attitudes without being everlastingly afraid that I shall be snapped by some fellow with a camera.” Roberson publicly took him to task over his hypocrisy, <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1904/07/27/117944284.html?pageNumber=1">writing</a>, “I take this opportunity to remind you that you have no such right.” She was correct then, and she still would be today. The question of whether anyone has the right to be free from exposure and its many humiliations lingers, intensified but unresolved. The law—that reactive, slow thing—never quite catches up to technology, whether it’s been given one year or 100.</p>

No one knows how many there are, what they eat, or even where they live in the vast expanse of the southern Pacific Ocean. However, scientists in New Zealand may have finally caught a break.</p><p>The country's conservation agency said Monday a creature that washed up on a South Island beach this month is believed to be a spade-toothed whale. The five-meter-long creature, a type of beaked whale, was identified after it washed ashore on Otago beach from its color patterns and the shape of its skull, beak and teeth </p><p>"We know very little, practically nothing" about the creatures, Hannah Hendriks, Marine Technical Advisor for the Department of Conservation, told The Associated Press. "This is going to lead to some amazing science and world-first information."</p><figure><span><img src="https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/07/15/354ba1f0-66a3-42f2-a66a-fbaf65f30d00/thumbnail/620x413/9f447d5bdb8d6d69eeed56b8bdef6947/ap24197315432718.jpg?v=5710b2ed1cee1bdfd30cb9c02455b43d#" alt="New Zealand Whale " height="413" width="620" data-srcset="https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/07/15/354ba1f0-66a3-42f2-a66a-fbaf65f30d00/thumbnail/620x413/9f447d5bdb8d6d69eeed56b8bdef6947/ap24197315432718.jpg?v=5710b2ed1cee1bdfd30cb9c02455b43d 1x, https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/07/15/354ba1f0-66a3-42f2-a66a-fbaf65f30d00/thumbnail/1240x826/1fb0d339f542e565c861bc311bda306e/ap24197315432718.jpg?v=5710b2ed1cee1bdfd30cb9c02455b43d 2x" srcset="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20413'%2F%3E"></span>

              </figcaption></figure><p>If the cetacean is confirmed to be the elusive spade-toothed whale, it would be the first specimen found in a state that would permit scientists to dissect it, allowing them to map the relationship of the whale to the few others of the species found and learn what it eats and perhaps lead to clues about where they live.  </p>    
  <p>Only six other spade-toothed whales have ever been pinpointed, and those found intact on New Zealand's North Island beaches had been buried before DNA testing could verify their identification, Hendriks said, thwarting any chance to study them. </p><p>This time, the beached whale was quickly transported to cold storage and researchers will work with local Māori iwi (tribes) to plan how it will be examined, the conservation agency said. </p>

    

<p>New Zealand's Indigenous people consider whales a taonga - a sacred treasure - of cultural significance. In April, Pacific Indigenous leaders signed a treaty recognizing whales as "legal persons," although such a declaration is not reflected in the laws of participating nations. </p><p>Nothing is currently known about the whales' habitat. The creatures deep-dive for food and likely surface so rarely that it has been impossible to narrow their location further than the southern Pacific Ocean, home to some of the world's deepest ocean trenches, Hendriks said.</p><figure><span><img src="https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/07/15/939d7bda-23c2-4352-817e-0150ffb4a673/thumbnail/620x413/585fd59d62b0745cbe4bfd2e03f52d07/ap24197315437769-1.jpg?v=5710b2ed1cee1bdfd30cb9c02455b43d#" alt="New Zealand Whale " height="413" width="620" data-srcset="https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/07/15/939d7bda-23c2-4352-817e-0150ffb4a673/thumbnail/620x413/585fd59d62b0745cbe4bfd2e03f52d07/ap24197315437769-1.jpg?v=5710b2ed1cee1bdfd30cb9c02455b43d 1x, https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/07/15/939d7bda-23c2-4352-817e-0150ffb4a673/thumbnail/1240x826/b83c914afd85cf9cf1bd5c1a0d8c3197/ap24197315437769-1.jpg?v=5710b2ed1cee1bdfd30cb9c02455b43d 2x" srcset="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20413'%2F%3E"></span>

              </figcaption></figure><p>"It's very hard to do research on marine mammals if you don't see them at sea," she said. "It's a bit of a needle in a haystack. You don't know where to look." </p><p>The conservation agency said the genetic testing to confirm the whale's identification could take months. </p>

    
    

<p>It took "many years and a mammoth amount of effort by researchers and local people" to identify the "incredibly cryptic" mammals, Kirsten Young, a senior lecturer at the University of Exeter who has studied spade-toothed whales, said in emailed remarks. </p><p>The fresh discovery "makes me wonder - how many are out in the deep ocean and how do they live?" Young said. </p><p>The first spade-toothed whale bones were found in 1872 on New Zealand's Pitt Island. Another discovery was made at an offshore island in the 1950s, and the bones of a third were found on Chile's Robinson Crusoe Island in 1986. DNA sequencing in 2002 proved that all three specimens were of the same species - and that it was one distinct from other beaked whales. </p><p>Researchers studying the mammal couldn't confirm if the species went extinct. Then in 2010, two whole spade-toothed whales, both dead, washed up on a New Zealand beach. Firstly mistaken for one of New Zealand's 13 other more common types of beaked whale, tissue samples - taken after they were buried - revealed them as the enigmatic species. </p><p>New Zealand is a whale-stranding hotspot, with more than 5,000 episodes recorded since 1840, according to the Department of Conservation. &nbsp;</p>
