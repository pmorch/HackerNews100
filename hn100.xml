</p>
</div> <p><span>In 2021, a </span><a href="https://books.google.co.il/books/about/The_Human_Machine_Team_How_to_Create_Syn.html?id=hjl1zgEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y"><span>book</span></a><span> titled “The Human-Machine Team: How to Create Synergy Between Human and Artificial Intelligence That Will Revolutionize Our World” was released in English under the pen name “Brigadier General Y.S.” In it, the author — a man who we confirmed to be the current commander of the elite Israeli intelligence unit 8200 — makes the case for designing a special machine that could rapidly process massive amounts of data to generate thousands of potential “targets” for military strikes in the heat of a war. Such technology, he writes, would resolve what he described as a “human bottleneck for both locating the new targets and decision-making to approve the targets.”</span></p>
<p><span>Such a machine, it turns out, actually exists. A new investigation by +972 Magazine and Local Call reveals that the Israeli army has developed an artificial intelligence-based program known as “Lavender,” unveiled here for the first time. According to six Israeli intelligence officers, who have all served in the army during the current war on the Gaza Strip and had first-hand involvement with the use of AI to generate targets for assassination, Lavender has played a central role in the unprecedented bombing of Palestinians, especially during the early stages of the war. In fact, according to the sources, its influence on the military’s operations was such that they essentially treated the outputs of the AI machine “as if it were a human decision.”</span></p>
<p><span>Formally, the Lavender system is designed to mark all suspected operatives in the military wings of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), including low-ranking ones, as potential bombing targets. The sources told +972 and Local Call that, during the first weeks of the war, the army almost completely relied on Lavender, which clocked as many as 37,000 Palestinians as suspected militants — and their homes — for possible air strikes.</span></p>
<p><span>During the early stages of the war, the army gave sweeping approval for officers to adopt Lavender’s kill lists, with no requirement to thoroughly check why the machine made those choices or to examine the raw intelligence data on which they were based. One source stated that human personnel often served only as a “rubber stamp” for the machine’s decisions, adding that, normally, they would personally devote only about “20 seconds” to each target before authorizing a bombing — just to make sure the Lavender-marked target is male. This was despite knowing that the system makes what are regarded as “errors” in approximately 10 percent of cases, and is known to occasionally mark individuals who have merely a loose connection to militant groups, or no connection at all.</span></p>
<p><span>Moreover, the Israeli army systematically attacked the targeted individuals while they were in their homes — usually at night while their whole families were present — rather than during the course of military activity. According to the sources, this was because, from what they regarded as an intelligence standpoint, it was easier to locate the individuals in their private houses. Additional automated systems, including one called “Where’s Daddy?” also revealed here for the first time, were used specifically to track the targeted individuals and carry out bombings when they had entered their family’s residences.</span></p>

</div>
<p><span>The result, as the sources testified, is that thousands of Palestinians — most of them women and children or people who were not involved in the fighting — were wiped out by Israeli airstrikes, especially during the first weeks of the war, because of the AI program’s decisions.</span></p>
<p><span>“We were not interested in killing [Hamas] operatives only when they were in a military building or engaged in a military activity,” A., an intelligence officer, told +972 and Local Call. “On the contrary, the IDF bombed them in homes without hesitation, as a first option. It’s much easier to bomb a family’s home. The system is built to look for them in these situations.”</span></p>
<p><span>The Lavender machine joins another AI system, “The Gospel,” about which information was revealed in a </span><a href="https://www.972mag.com/mass-assassination-factory-israel-calculated-bombing-gaza/"><span>previous investigation</span></a><span> by +972 and Local Call in November 2023, as well as in the Israeli military’s own </span><a href="https://www.israeldefense.co.il/node/57256#google_vignette"><span>publications</span></a><span>. A fundamental difference between the two systems is in the definition of the target: whereas The Gospel marks buildings and structures that the army claims militants operate from, Lavender marks people — and puts them on a kill list.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In addition, according to the sources, when it came to targeting alleged junior militants marked by Lavender, the army preferred to only use unguided missiles, commonly known as “dumb” bombs (in contrast to “smart” precision bombs), which can destroy entire buildings on top of their occupants and cause significant casualties. “You don’t want to waste expensive bombs on unimportant people — it’s very expensive for the country and there’s a shortage [of those bombs],” said C., one of the intelligence officers. Another source said that they had personally authorized the bombing of “hundreds” of private homes of alleged junior operatives marked by Lavender, with many of these attacks killing civilians and entire families as “collateral damage.”</span></p>
<p><span>In an unprecedented move, according to two of the sources, the army also decided during the first weeks of the war that, for every junior Hamas operative that Lavender marked, it was permissible to kill up to 15 or 20 civilians; in the past, the military did not authorize any “collateral damage” during assassinations of low-ranking militants. The sources added that, in the event that the target was a senior Hamas official with the rank of battalion or brigade commander, the army on several occasions authorized the killing of more than 100 civilians in the assassination of a single commander.</span></p>

</div>
<p><span>The following investigation is organized according to the six chronological stages of the Israeli army’s highly automated target production in the early weeks of the Gaza war. First, we explain the Lavender machine itself, which marked tens of thousands of Palestinians using AI. Second, we reveal the “Where’s Daddy?” system, which tracked these targets and signaled to the army when they entered their family homes. Third, we describe how “dumb” bombs were chosen to strike these homes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Fourth, we explain how the army loosened the permitted number of civilians who could be killed during the bombing of a target. Fifth, we note how automated software inaccurately calculated the amount of non-combatants in each household. And sixth, we show how on several occasions, when a home was struck, usually at night, the individual target was sometimes not inside at all, because military officers did not verify the information in real time.</span></p>
<h3><span>STEP 1: GENERATING TARGETS</span></h3>
<h3>‘Once you go automatic, target generation goes crazy’</h3>
<p><span>In the Israeli army, the term “human target” referred in the past to a senior military operative who, according to the rules of the military’s International Law Department, can be killed in their private home even if there are civilians around. Intelligence sources told +972 and Local Call that during Israel’s previous wars, since this was an “especially brutal” way to kill someone — often by killing an entire family alongside the target — such human targets were marked very carefully and only senior military commanders were bombed in their homes, to maintain the principle of proportionality under international law.</span></p>
<p><span>But after October 7 — when Hamas-led militants launched a deadly assault on southern Israeli communities, killing around 1,200 people and abducting 240 — the army, the sources said, took a dramatically different approach. Under “Operation Iron Swords,” the army decided to designate all operatives of Hamas’ military wing as human targets, regardless of their rank or military importance. And that changed everything.</span></p>
<p><span>The new policy also posed a technical problem for Israeli intelligence. In previous wars, in order to authorize the assassination of a single human target, an officer had to go through a complex and lengthy “incrimination” process: cross-check evidence that the person was indeed a senior member of Hamas’ military wing, find out where he lived, his contact information, and finally know when he was home in real time. When the list of targets numbered only a few dozen senior operatives, intelligence personnel could individually handle the work involved in incriminating and locating them.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_177464"><p><a href="https://static.972mag.com/www/uploads/2024/04/main_image51785_4WLiR7887N.jpg" data-featherlight="image"><img title="Palestinians try to rescue survivors and pull bodies from the rubble after Israeli airstrikes hit buildings near Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza, October 22, 2023.

</div>
<p><span>However, once the list was expanded to include tens of thousands of lower-ranking operatives, the Israeli army figured it had to rely on automated software and artificial intelligence. The result, the sources testify, was that the role of human personnel in incriminating Palestinians as military operatives was pushed aside, and AI did most of the work instead. According to four of the sources who spoke to +972 and Local Call, Lavender — which was developed to create human targets in the current war — has marked some 37,000 Palestinians as suspected “Hamas militants,” most of them junior, for assassination (the IDF Spokesperson denied the existence of such a kill list in a statement to +972 and Local Call).</span></p>
<p><span>“We didn’t know who the junior operatives were, because Israel didn’t track them routinely [before the war],” explained senior officer B. to +972 and Local Call, illuminating the reason behind the development of this particular target machine for the current war. “They wanted to allow us to attack [the junior operatives] automatically. That’s the Holy Grail. Once you go automatic, target generation goes crazy.”</span></p>
<p><span>The sources said that the approval to automatically adopt Lavender’s kill lists, which had previously been used only as an auxiliary tool, was granted about two weeks into the war, after intelligence personnel “manually” checked the accuracy of a random sample of several hundred targets selected by the AI system. When that sample found that Lavender’s results had reached 90 percent accuracy in identifying an individual’s affiliation with Hamas, the army authorized the sweeping use of the system. From that moment, sources said that if Lavender decided an individual was a militant in Hamas, they were essentially asked to treat that as an order, with no requirement to independently check why the machine made that choice or to examine the raw intelligence data on which it is based.</span></p>
<p><span>“At 5 a.m., </span><span>[the air force]</span><span> would come and bomb all the houses that we had marked,” B. said. “We took out thousands of people. We didn’t go through them one by one — we put everything into automated systems, and as soon as one of [the marked individuals] was at home, he immediately became a target. We bombed him and his house.”</span></p>
<p><span>The deadly results of this loosening of restrictions in the early stage of the war were staggering. According to data from the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza, on which the Israeli army has </span><a href="https://www.mekomit.co.il/%d7%94%d7%a6%d7%91%d7%90-%d7%91%d7%93%d7%a7-%d7%95%d7%9e%d7%a6%d7%90-%d7%a9%d7%93%d7%99%d7%95%d7%95%d7%97%d7%99-%d7%94%d7%94%d7%a8%d7%95%d7%92%d7%99%d7%9d-%d7%91%d7%9e%d7%a9%d7%a8%d7%93-%d7%94%d7%91/"><span>relied almost exclusively</span></a><span> since the beginning of the war, Israel killed some 15,000 Palestinians — almost half of the death toll so far — in the </span><a href="https://www.ochaopt.org/content/hostilities-gaza-strip-and-israel-flash-update-50"><span>first six weeks</span></a><span> of the war, up until a week-long ceasefire was agreed on Nov. 24.</span></p>

<h3>‘The more information and variety, the better’</h3>
<p><span>The Lavender software analyzes information collected on most of the 2.3 million residents of the Gaza Strip through a system of mass surveillance, then assesses and ranks the likelihood that each particular person is active in the military wing of Hamas or PIJ. According to sources, the machine gives almost every single person in Gaza a rating from 1 to 100, expressing how likely it is that they are a militant.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Lavender learns to identify characteristics of known Hamas and PIJ operatives, whose information was fed to the machine as training data, and then to locate these same characteristics — also called “features” — among the general population, the sources explained. An individual found to have several different incriminating features will reach a high rating, and thus automatically becomes a potential target for assassination.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In “The Human-Machine Team,” the book referenced at the beginning of this article, the current commander of Unit 8200 advocates for such a system without referencing Lavender by name. (The commander himself also isn’t named, but five sources in 8200 confirmed that the commander is the author, as </span><a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2021-10-01/ty-article/.highlight/top-israeli-intel-officer-goes-where-no-ones-gone-before-and-its-all-on-amazon/0000017f-e1fb-df7c-a5ff-e3fb21210000"><span>reported</span></a><span> also by Haaretz.) Describing human personnel as a “bottleneck” that limits the army’s capacity during a military operation, The commander laments: “We [humans] cannot process so much information. It doesn’t matter how many people you have tasked to produce targets during the war — you still cannot produce enough targets per day.”</span></p>
<p><span>The solution to this problem, he says, is artificial intelligence. The book offers a short guide to building a “target machine,” similar in description to Lavender, based on AI and machine-learning algorithms. Included in this guide are several examples of the “hundreds and thousands” of features that can increase an individual’s rating, such as being in a Whatsapp group with a known militant, changing cell phone every few months, and changing addresses frequently.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“The more information, and the more variety, the better,” the commander writes. “Visual information, cellular information, social media connections, battlefield information, phone contacts, photos.” While humans select these features at first, the commander continues, over time the machine will come to identify features on its own. This, he says, can enable militaries to create “tens of thousands of targets,” while the actual decision as to whether or not to attack them will remain a human one.</span></p>
<p><span>The book isn’t the only time a senior Israeli commander hinted at the existence of human target machines like Lavender. +972 and Local Call have obtained footage of a private lecture given by the commander of Unit 8200’s secretive Data Science and AI center, “Col. Yoav,” at Tel Aviv University’s AI week in 2023, which was </span><a href="https://www.geektime.co.il/idf-fights-hamas-with-ai-and-data-science/"><span>reported on</span></a><span> at the time in the Israeli media.</span></p>
<p><span>In the lecture, the commander speaks about a new, sophisticated target machine used by the Israeli army that detects “dangerous people” based on their likeness to existing lists of known militants on which it was trained. “Using the system, we managed to identify Hamas missile squad commanders,” Col. Yoav said in the lecture, referring to Israel’s May 2021 military operation in Gaza, when the machine was used for the first time.&nbsp;</span></p>

</div>
<p><span>The lecture presentation slides, also obtained by +972 and Local Call, contain illustrations of how the machine works: it is fed data about existing Hamas operatives, it learns to notice their features, and then it rates other Palestinians based on how similar they are to the militants.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“We rank the results and determine the threshold [at which to attack a target],” Col. Yoav said in the lecture, emphasizing that “eventually, people of flesh and blood take the decisions. In the defense realm, ethically speaking, we put a lot of emphasis on this. These tools are meant to help [intelligence officers] break their barriers.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In practice, however, sources who have used Lavender in recent months say human agency and precision were substituted for mass target creation and lethality.</span></p>
<h3>‘There was no “zero-error” policy’</h3>
<p><span>B., a senior officer who used Lavender, echoed to +972 and Local Call that in the current war, officers were not required to independently review the AI system’s assessments, in order to save time and enable the mass production of human targets without hindrances.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“Everything was statistical, everything was neat — it was very dry,” B. said. He noted that this lack of supervision was permitted despite internal checks showing that Lavender’s calculations were considered accurate only 90 percent of the time; in other words, it was known in advance that 10 percent of the human targets slated for assassination were not members of the Hamas military wing at all.</span></p>
<p><span>For example, sources explained that the Lavender machine sometimes mistakenly flagged individuals who had communication patterns similar to known Hamas or PIJ operatives — including police and civil defense workers, militants’ relatives, residents who happened to have a name and nickname identical to that of an operative, and Gazans who used a device that once belonged to a Hamas operative.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“How close does a person have to be to Hamas to be [considered by an AI machine to be] affiliated with the organization?” said one source critical of Lavender’s inaccuracy. “It’s a vague boundary. Is a person who doesn’t receive a salary from Hamas, but helps them with all sorts of things, a Hamas operative? Is someone who was in Hamas in the past, but is no longer there today, a Hamas operative? Each of these features — characteristics that a machine would flag as suspicious — is inaccurate.”</span></p>
<div id="attachment_177451"><p><a href="https://static.972mag.com/www/uploads/2024/03/F240224ARK09.jpg" data-featherlight="image"><img title="Palestinians at the site of an Israeli airstrike in Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip, February 24, 2024.

</div>
<p><span>Similar problems exist with the ability of target machines to assess the phone used by an individual marked for assassination. “In war, Palestinians change phones all the time,” said the source. “People lose contact with their families, give their phone to a friend or a wife, maybe lose it. There is no way to rely 100 percent on the automatic mechanism that determines which [phone] number belongs to whom.”</span></p>
<p><span>According to the sources, the army knew that the minimal human supervision in place would not discover these faults. “There was no ‘zero-error’ policy. Mistakes were treated statistically,” said a source who used Lavender. “Because of the scope and magnitude, the protocol was that even if you don’t know for sure that the machine is right, you know that statistically it’s fine. So you go for it.”</span></p>
<p><span>“It has proven itself,” said B., the senior source. “There’s something about the statistical approach that sets you to a certain norm and standard. There has been an illogical amount of [bombings] in this operation. This is unparalleled, in my memory. And I have much more trust in a statistical mechanism than a soldier who lost a friend two days ago. Everyone there, including me, lost people on October 7. The machine did it coldly. And that made it easier.”</span></p>
<p><span>Another intelligence source, who defended the reliance on the Lavender-generated kill lists of Palestinian suspects, argued that it was worth investing an intelligence officer’s time only to verify the information if the target was a senior commander in Hamas. “But when it comes to a junior militant, you don’t want to invest manpower and time in it,” he said. “In war, there is no time to incriminate every target. So you’re willing to take the margin of error of using artificial intelligence, risking collateral damage and civilians dying, and risking attacking by mistake, and to live with it.”</span></p>
<p>B. said that the reason for this automation was a constant push to generate more targets for assassination. “In a day without targets [whose feature rating was sufficient to authorize a strike], we attacked at a lower threshold. We were constantly being pressured: ‘Bring us more targets.’ They really shouted at us. We finished [killing] our targets very quickly.”</p>
<p><span>He explained that when lowering the rating threshold of Lavender, it would mark more people as targets for strikes. “At its peak, the system managed to generate 37,000 people as potential human targets,” said B. “But the numbers changed all the time, because it depends on where you set the bar of what a Hamas operative is. There were times when a Hamas operative was defined more broadly, and then the machine started bringing us all kinds of civil defense personnel, police officers, on whom it would be a shame to waste bombs. They help the Hamas government, but they don’t really endanger soldiers.”</span></p>

<h3>‘We only checked that the target was a man’</h3>
<p><span>The Israeli military flatly rejects these claims. In a statement to +972 and Local Call, the IDF Spokesperson denied using artificial intelligence to incriminate targets, saying these are merely “auxiliary tools that assist officers in the process of incrimination.” The statement went on: “In any case, an independent examination by an [intelligence] analyst is required, which verifies that the identified targets are legitimate targets for attack, in accordance with the conditions set forth in IDF directives and international law.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, sources said that the only human supervision protocol in place before bombing the houses of suspected “junior” militants marked by Lavender was to conduct a single check: ensuring that the AI-selected target is male rather than female. The assumption in the army was that if it were a woman, the machine had likely made a mistake, because there are no women among the ranks of the military wings of Hamas and PIJ.</span></p>
<p><span>“A human being had to [verify the target] for just a few seconds,” B. said, explaining that this became the protocol after realizing the Lavender system was “getting it right” most of the time. “At first, we did checks to ensure that the machine didn’t get confused. But at some point we relied on the automatic system, and we only checked that [the target] was a man — that was enough. It doesn’t take a long time to tell if someone has a male or a female voice.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To conduct the male/female check, B. claimed that in the current war, “I would invest 20 seconds for each target at this stage, and do dozens of them every day. I had zero added value as a human, apart from being a stamp of approval. It saved a lot of time. If [the operative] came up in the automated mechanism, and I checked that he was a man, there would be permission to bomb him, subject to an examination of collateral damage.”</span></p>

</div>
<p><span>In practice, sources said this meant that for civilian men marked in error by Lavender, there was no supervising mechanism in place to detect the mistake.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>STEP 2: LINKING TARGETS TO FAMILY HOMES</span></h3>
<h3>‘Most of the people you killed were women and children’</h3>
<p><span>The next stage in the Israeli army’s assassination procedure is identifying where to attack the targets that Lavender generates.</span></p>
<p><span>In a statement to +972 and Local Call, the IDF Spokesperson claimed in response to this article that “Hamas places its operatives and military assets in the heart of the civilian population, systematically uses the civilian population as human shields, and conducts fighting from within civilian structures, including sensitive sites such as hospitals, mosques, schools and UN facilities. The IDF is bound by and acts according to international law, directing its attacks only at military targets and military operatives.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The six sources we spoke to echoed this to some degree, saying that Hamas’ extensive </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/02/12/world/middleeast/gaza-tunnel-israel-hamas.html"><span>tunnel system</span></a><span> deliberately passes under hospitals and schools; that Hamas militants use ambulances to get around; and that countless military assets have been situated near civilian buildings. The sources argued that many Israeli strikes kill civilians as a result of these tactics by Hamas — a characterization that human rights groups <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/03/19/israeli-forces-conduct-gaza">warn</a> evades Israel’s onus for inflicting the casualties.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, in contrast to the Israeli army’s official statements, the sources explained that a major reason for the unprecedented death toll from Israel’s current bombardment is the fact that the army has systematically attacked targets in their private homes, alongside their families — in part because it was easier from an intelligence standpoint to mark family houses using automated systems.</span></p>
<p><span>Indeed, several sources emphasized that, as opposed to numerous cases of Hamas operatives engaging in military activity from civilian areas, in the case of systematic assassination strikes, the army routinely made the active choice to bomb suspected militants when inside civilian households from which no military activity took place. This choice, they said, was a reflection of the way Israel’s system of mass surveillance in Gaza is designed.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_177465"><p><a href="https://static.972mag.com/www/uploads/2024/04/main_image51496_c8EQed2mC6.jpg" data-featherlight="image"><img title="Palestinians rush to bring the wounded, including many children, to Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City as Israeli forces continue pounding the Gaza Strip, October 11, 2023.

</div>
<p><span>The sources told +972 and Local Call that since everyone in Gaza had a private house with which they could be associated, the army’s surveillance systems could easily and automatically “link” individuals to family houses. In order to identify the moment operatives enter their houses in real time, various additional automatic softwares have been developed. These programs track thousands of individuals simultaneously, identify when they are at home, and send an automatic alert to the targeting officer, who then marks the house for bombing. One of several of these tracking softwares, revealed here for the first time, is called “Where’s Daddy?”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“You put hundreds [of targets] into the system and wait to see who you can kill,” said one source with knowledge of the system. “It’s called broad hunting: you copy-paste from the lists that the target system produces.”</span></p>
<p><span>Evidence of this policy is also clear from the data: during the first month of the war, more than half of the fatalities — 6,120 people — belonged to 1,340 families, many of which were completely wiped out while inside their homes, according to </span><a href="https://www.ochaopt.org/content/hostilities-gaza-strip-and-israel-reported-impact-day-45"><span>UN figures</span></a><span>. The proportion of entire </span><a href="https://www.972mag.com/gaza-families-bombing-humanitarian-crisis/"><span>families</span></a><span> bombed in their houses in the current war is much higher </span><a href="https://www.btselem.org/download/201501_black_flag_eng.pdf"><span>than in the 2014 Israeli operation</span></a><span> in Gaza, further suggesting the prominence of this policy.</span></p>
<p><span>Another source said that each time the pace of assassinations waned, more targets were added to systems like Where’s Daddy? to locate individuals that entered their homes and could therefore be bombed. He said that the decision of who to put into the tracking systems could be made by relatively low-ranking officers in the military hierarchy.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“One day, totally of my own accord, I added something like 1,200 new targets to the [tracking] system, because the number of attacks [we were conducting] decreased,” the source said. “That made sense to me. In retrospect, it seems like a serious decision I made. And such decisions were not made at high levels.”</span></p>
<p><span>The sources said that in the first two weeks of the war, “several thousand” targets were initially inputted into locating programs like Where’s Daddy?. These included all the members of Hamas’ elite special forces unit the Nukhba, all of Hamas’ anti-tank operatives, and anyone who entered Israel on October 7. But before long, the kill list was drastically expanded.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“In the end it was everyone [marked by Lavender],” one source explained. “Tens of thousands. This happened a few weeks later, when the [Israeli] brigades entered Gaza, and there were already fewer uninvolved people [i.e. civilians] in the northern areas.” According to this source, even some minors were marked by Lavender as targets for bombing. “Normally, operatives are over the age of 17, but that was not a condition.”</span></p>

</div>
<p><span>Lavender and systems like Where’s Daddy? were thus combined with deadly effect, killing entire families, sources said. By adding a name from the Lavender-generated lists to the Where’s Daddy? home tracking system, A. explained, the marked person would be placed under ongoing surveillance, and could be attacked as soon as they set foot in their home, collapsing the house on everyone inside.</span></p>
<p><span>“Let’s say you calculate [that there is one] Hamas [operative] plus 10 [civilians in the house],” A. said. “Usually, these 10 will be women and children. So absurdly, it turns out that most of the people you killed were women and children.”</span></p>
<h3><span>STEP 3: CHOOSING A WEAPON</span></h3>
<h3>‘We usually carried out the attacks with “dumb bombs”’</h3>
<p><span>Once Lavender has marked a target for assassination, army personnel have verified that they are male, and tracking software has located the target in their home, the next stage is picking the munition with which to bomb them.</span></p>
<p><span>In December 2023, </span><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2023/12/13/politics/intelligence-assessment-dumb-bombs-israel-gaza/index.html"><span>CNN reported</span></a> <span>that according to U.S. intelligence estimates, about 45 percent of the munitions used by the Israeli air force in Gaza were “dumb” bombs, which are known to cause more collateral damage than guided bombs. In response to the CNN report, an army spokesperson quoted in the article said: “A</span><span>s a military committed to international law and a moral code of conduct, we are devoting vast resources to minimizing harm to the civilians that Hamas has forced into the role of human shields. Our war is against Hamas, not against the people of Gaza.”</span></p>
<p><span>Three intelligence sources, however, told +972 and Local Call that junior operatives marked by Lavender were assassinated only with dumb bombs, in the interest of saving more expensive armaments. The implication, one source explained, was that the army would not strike a junior target if they lived in a high-rise building, because the army did not want to spend a more precise and expensive “floor bomb” (with more limited collateral effect) to kill him. But if a junior target lived in a building with only a few floors, the army was authorized to kill him and everyone in the building with a dumb bomb.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_177445"><p><a href="https://static.972mag.com/www/uploads/2024/03/F240318ARK043.jpg" data-featherlight="image"><img title="Palestinians at the site of a building destroyed by an Israeli airstrike in Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip, March 18, 2024.

</div>
<p><span>“It was like that with all the junior targets,” testified C., who used various automated programs in the current war. “The only question was, is it possible to attack the building in terms of collateral damage? Because we usually carried out the attacks with dumb bombs, and that meant literally destroying the whole house on top of its occupants. But even if an attack is averted, you don’t care — you immediately move on to the next target. Because of the system, the targets never end. You have another 36,000 waiting.”</span></p>
<h3><span>STEP 4: AUTHORIZING CIVILIAN CASUALTIES</span></h3>
<h3>‘We attacked almost without considering collateral damage’</h3>
<p><span>One source said that when attacking junior operatives, including those marked by AI systems like Lavender, the number of civilians they were allowed to kill alongside each target was fixed during the initial weeks of the war at up to 20. Another source claimed the fixed number was up to 15. These “collateral damage degrees,” as the military calls them, were applied broadly to all suspected junior militants, the sources said, regardless of their rank, military importance, and age, and with no specific case-by-case examination to weigh the military advantage of assassinating them against the expected harm to civilians.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>According to A., who was an officer in a target operation room in the current war, the army’s international law department has never before given such “sweeping approval” for such a high collateral damage degree. “It’s not just that you can kill any person who is a Hamas soldier, which is clearly permitted and legitimate in terms of international law,” A. said. “But they directly tell you: ‘You are allowed to kill them along with many civilians.’&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“Every person who wore a Hamas uniform in the past year or two could be bombed with 20 [civilians killed as] collateral damage, even without special permission,” A. continued. “In practice, the principle of proportionality did not exist.”</span></p>
<p><span>According to A., this was the policy for most of the time that he served. Only later did the military lower the collateral damage degree. “In this calculation, it could also be 20 children for a junior operative … It really wasn’t like that in the past,” A. explained. Asked about the security rationale behind this policy, A. replied: “Lethality.”</span></p>
<div id="attachment_177453"><p><a href="https://static.972mag.com/www/uploads/2024/03/F231107ARK20.jpg" data-featherlight="image"><img title="Palestinians wait to receive the bodies of their relatives who were killed in Israeli airstrikes, at Al-Najjar Hospital in Rafah, southern Gaza Strip, November 7, 2023.

</div>
<p><span>The predetermined and fixed collateral damage degree helped accelerate the mass creation of targets using the Lavender machine, sources said, because it saved time. B. claimed that the number of civilians they were permitted to kill per suspected junior militant marked by AI in the first week of the war, was fifteen, but that this number “went up and down” over time.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“At first we attacked almost without considering collateral damage,” B. said of the first week after October 7. “In practice, you didn’t really count people [in each house that is bombed], because you couldn’t really tell if they’re at home or not. After a week, restrictions on collateral damage began. The number dropped [from 15] to five, which made it really difficult for us to attack, because if the whole family was home, we couldn’t bomb it. Then they raised the number again.”</span></p>
<h3>‘We knew we would kill over 100 civilians’</h3>
<p><span>Sources told +972 and Local Call that now, partly due to American pressure, the Israeli army is no longer mass-generating junior human targets for bombing in civilian homes. The fact that most homes in the Gaza Strip were already destroyed or damaged, and almost the entire population has been displaced, also impaired the army’s ability to rely on intelligence databases and automated house-locating programs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>E. claimed that the massive bombardment of junior militants took place only in the first week or two of the war, and then was stopped mainly so as not to waste bombs. “There is a munitions economy,” E. said. “They were always afraid that there would be [a war] in the northern arena [with Hezbollah in Lebanon]. They don’t attack these kinds of [junior] people at all anymore.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, airstrikes against senior ranking Hamas commanders are still ongoing, and sources said that for these attacks, the military is authorizing the killing of “hundreds” of civilians per target — an official policy for which there is no historical precedent in Israel, or even in recent U.S. military operations.</span></p>
<p><span>“In the bombing of the commander of the Shuja’iya Battalion, we knew that we would kill over 100 civilians,” B. recalled of a Dec. 2 bombing that the IDF Spokesperson </span><a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/idf-strike-kills-gazan-terrorist-responsible-for-attack-that-killed-oron-shaul-in-2014/"><span>said</span></a><span> was aimed at assassinating Wisam Farhat. “For me, psychologically, it was unusual. Over 100 civilians — it crosses some red line.”</span></p>

</div>
<p><span>Amjad Al-Sheikh, a young Palestinian from Gaza, said many of his family members were killed in that bombing. A resident of Shuja’iya, east of Gaza City, he was at a local supermarket that day when he heard five blasts that shattered the glass windows.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“I ran to my family’s house, but there were no buildings there anymore,” Al-Sheikh told +972 and Local Call. “The street was filled with screams and smoke. Entire residential blocks turned to mountains of rubble and deep pits. People began to search in the cement, using their hands, and so did I, looking for signs of my family’s house.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Al-Sheikh’s wife and baby daughter survived — protected from the rubble by a closet that fell on top of them — but he found 11 other members of his family, among them his sisters, brothers, and their young children, dead under the rubble. </span><a href="https://www.btselem.org/hebrew/gaza_strip/20231205_israel_is_not_fighting_against_hamas_but_against_civilians_implementing_a_criminal_policy_of_bombings"><span>According to</span></a><span> the human rights group B’Tselem, the bombing that day destroyed dozens of buildings, killed dozens of people, and buried hundreds under the ruins of their homes.</span></p>
<h3>‘Entire families were killed’</h3>
<p><span>Intelligence sources told +972 and Local Call they took part in even deadlier strikes. In order to assassinate Ayman Nofal, the commander of Hamas’ Central Gaza Brigade, a source said the army authorized the killing of approximately 300 civilians, </span><a href="https://www.ynet.co.il/news/article/ryxl6b2116"><span>destroying several buildings</span></a><span> in airstrikes on Al-Bureij refugee camp on Oct. 17 based on an imprecise pinpointing of Nofal. Satellite footage and </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Roaastudies/status/1714253580792643820"><span>videos</span></a><span> from the scene show the destruction of several large multi-storey apartment buildings.</span></p>
<p><span>“Between 16 to 18 houses were wiped out in the attack,” Amro Al-Khatib, a resident of the camp, told +972 and Local Call. “We couldn’t tell one apartment from the other — they all got mixed up in the rubble, and we found human body parts everywhere.”</span></p>
<p><span>In the aftermath, Al-Khatib recalled around 50 dead bodies being pulled out of the rubble, and around 200 people wounded, many of them gravely. But that was just the first day. The camp’s residents spent five days pulling the dead and injured out, he said.</span></p>

</div>
<p><span>Nael Al-Bahisi, a paramedic, was one of the first on the scene. He counted between 50-70 casualties on that first day. “At a certain moment, we understood the target of the strike was Hamas commander Ayman Nofal,” he told +972 and Local Call. “They killed him, and also many people who didn’t know he was there. Entire families with children were killed.”</span></p>
<p><span>Another intelligence source told +972 and Local Call that the army </span><a href="https://www.israelhayom.co.il/news/defense/article/14992654"><span>destroyed a high-rise building</span></a><span> in Rafah in mid-December, killing “dozens of civilians,” in order </span><a href="https://www.israelhayom.co.il/news/defense/article/14992654"><span>to try to kill</span></a><span> Mohammed Shabaneh, the commander of Hamas’ Rafah Brigade (it is not clear whether or not he was killed in the attack). Often, the source said, the senior commanders hide in tunnels that pass under civilian buildings, and therefore the choice to assassinate them with an airstrike necessarily kills civilians.</span></p>
<p><span>“Most of those injured were children,” said Wael Al-Sir, 55, who witnessed the large-scale strike believed by some Gazans to have been the assassination attempt. He told +972 and Local Call that the bombing on Dec. 20 destroyed an “entire residential block” and killed at least 10 children.</span></p>
<p><span>“There was a completely permissive policy regarding the casualties of [bombing] operations — so permissive that in my opinion it had an element of revenge,” D., an intelligence source, claimed. “The core of this was the assassinations of senior [Hamas and PIJ commanders] for whom they were willing to kill hundreds of civilians. We had a calculation: how many for a brigade commander, how many for a battalion commander, and so on.”</span></p>
<p><span>“There were regulations, but they were just very lenient,” said E., another intelligence source. “We’ve killed people with collateral damage in the high double digits, if not low triple digits. These are things that haven’t happened before.”</span></p>

</div>
<p><span>Such a high rate of “collateral damage” is exceptional not only compared to what the Israeli army previously deemed acceptable, but also compared to the wars waged by the United States in Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>General Peter Gersten, </span><span>Deputy Commander for Operations and Intelligence </span><span>in the operation to fight ISIS in Iraq and Syria, </span><a href="https://www.defensedaily.com/pentagon-removed-non-combatant-casualty-cut-off-value-doctrine-2018/pentagon/"><span>told</span></a><span> a U.S. defense magazine in 2021 that an attack with collateral damage of 15 civilians deviated from procedure; to carry it out, he had to obtain special permission from the head of the U.S. Central Command, General Lloyd Austin, who is now Secretary of Defense.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“With Osama Bin Laden, you’d have an NCV [Non-combatant Casualty Value] of 30, but if you had a low-level commander, his NCV was typically zero,” Gersten said. “We ran zero for the longest time.”</span></p>
<h3>‘We were told: “Whatever you can, bomb”’</h3>
<p><span>All the sources interviewed for this investigation said that Hamas’ massacres on October 7 and kidnapping of hostages greatly influenced the army’s fire policy and collateral damage degrees. “At first, the atmosphere was painful and vindictive,” said B., who was drafted into the army immediately after October 7, and served in a target operation room. “The rules were very lenient. They took down four buildings when they knew the target was in one of them. It was crazy.</span></p>
<p><span>“There was a dissonance: on the one hand, people here were frustrated that we were not attacking enough,” B. continued. “On the other hand, you see at the end of the day that another thousand Gazans have died, most of them civilians.”</span></p>
<p><span>“There was hysteria in the professional ranks,” said D., who was also drafted immediately after October 7. “They had no idea how to react at all. The only thing they knew to do was to just start bombing like madmen to try to dismantle Hamas’ capabilities.”</span></p>
<div id="attachment_174647"><p><a href="https://static.972mag.com/www/uploads/2023/10/F231019CG008.jpg" data-featherlight="image"><img title="Defence Minister Yoav Gallant speaks with Israeli soldiers at a staging area not far from the Gaza fence, October 19, 2023.

</div>
<p>D. stressed that they were not explicitly told that the army’s goal was “revenge,” but expressed that “as soon as every target connected to Hamas becomes legitimate, and with almost any collateral damage being approved, it is clear to you that thousands of people are going to be killed. Even if officially every target is connected to Hamas, when the policy is so permissive, it loses all meaning.”</p>
<p><span>A. also used the word “revenge” to describe the atmosphere inside the army after October 7. “No one thought about what to do afterward, when the war is over, or how it will be possible to live in Gaza and what they will do with it,” A. said. “We were told: now we have to fuck up Hamas, no matter what the cost. Whatever you can, you bomb.”</span></p>
<p><span>B., the senior intelligence source, said that in retrospect, he believes this “disproportionate” policy of killing Palestinians in Gaza also endangers Israelis, and that this was one of the reasons he decided to be interviewed.</span></p>
<p><span>“In the short term, we are safer, because we hurt Hamas. But I think we’re less secure in the long run. I see how all the bereaved families in Gaza — which is nearly everyone — will raise the motivation for [people to join] Hamas 10 years down the line. And it will be much easier for [Hamas] to recruit them.”</span></p>
<p><span>In a statement to +972 and Local Call, the Israeli army denied much of what the sources told us, claiming that “each target is examined individually, while an individual assessment is made of the military advantage and collateral damage expected from the attack … The IDF does not carry out attacks when the collateral damage expected from the attack is excessive in relation to the military advantage.”</span></p>
<h3><span>STEP 5: CALCULATING COLLATERAL DAMAGE</span></h3>
<h3>‘The model was not connected to reality’</h3>
<p><span>According to the intelligence sources, the Israeli army’s calculation of the number of civilians expected to be killed in each house alongside a target — a procedure examined in a </span><a href="https://www.972mag.com/mass-assassination-factory-israel-calculated-bombing-gaza/"><span>previous investigation</span></a><span> by +972 and Local Call — was conducted with the help of automatic and inaccurate tools. In previous wars, intelligence personnel would spend a lot of time verifying how many people were in a house that was set to be bombed, with the number of civilians liable to be killed listed as part of a “target file.” After October 7, however, this thorough verification was largely abandoned in favor of automation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In October, The New York Times </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/16/world/middleeast/gaza-invasion-israel-cellphone-data.html"><span>reported</span></a><span> on a system operated from a special base in southern Israel, which collects information from mobile phones in the Gaza Strip and provided the military with a live estimate of the number of Palestinians who fled the northern Gaza Strip southward. Brig. General Udi Ben Muha told the Times that “It’s not a 100 percent perfect system — but it gives you the information you need to make a decision.” The system operates according to colors: red marks areas where there are many people, and green and yellow mark areas that have been relatively cleared of residents.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div id="attachment_175999"><p><a href="https://static.972mag.com/www/uploads/2024/01/F231110AM03.jpg" data-featherlight="image"><img title="Palestinians walk on a main road after fleeing from their homes in Gaza City to the southern part of Gaza, November 10, 2023.

</div>
<p><span>The sources who spoke to +972 and Local Call described a similar system for calculating collateral damage, which was used to decide whether to bomb a building in Gaza. They said that the software calculated the number of civilians residing in each home before the war — by assessing the size of the building and reviewing its list of residents — and then reduced those numbers by the proportion of residents who supposedly evacuated the neighborhood.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To illustrate, if the army estimated that half of a neighborhood’s residents had left, the program would count a house that usually had 10 residents as a house containing five people. To save time, the sources said, the army did not surveil the homes to check how many people were actually living there, as it did in previous operations, to find out if the program’s estimate was indeed accurate.</span></p>
<p><span>“This model was not connected to reality,” claimed one source. “There was no connection between those who were in the home now, during the war, and those who were listed as living there prior to the war. [On one occasion] we bombed a house without knowing that there were several families inside, hiding together.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The source said that although the army knew that such errors could occur, this imprecise model was adopted nonetheless, because it was faster. As such, the source said, “the collateral damage calculation was completely automatic and statistical” — even producing figures that were not whole numbers.</span></p>
<h3><span>STEP 6: BOMBING A FAMILY HOME</span></h3>
<h3>‘You killed a family for no reason’</h3>
<p><span>The sources who spoke to +972 and Local Call explained that there was sometimes a substantial gap between the moment that tracking systems like Where’s Daddy? alerted an officer that a target had entered their house, and the bombing itself — leading to the killing of whole families even without hitting the army’s target. “It happened to me many times that we attacked a house, but the person wasn’t even home,” one source said. “The result is that you killed a family for no reason.”</span></p>
<p><span>Three intelligence sources told +972 and Local Call that they had witnessed an incident in which the Israeli army bombed a family’s private home, and it later turned out that the intended target of the assassination was not even inside the house, since no further verification was conducted in real time.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_174976"><p><a href="https://static.972mag.com/www/uploads/2023/11/F231106ARK01.jpg" data-featherlight="image"><img title="Palestinians receive the bodies of relatives who were killed in Israeli airstrikes, Al-Najjar Hospital, southern Gaza Strip, November 6, 2023. (Abed Rahim Khatib/Flash90)" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://static.972mag.com/www/uploads/2023/11/F231106ARK01-1280x853.jpg" alt="Palestinians receive the bodies of relatives who were killed in Israeli airstrikes, Al-Najjar Hospital, southern Gaza Strip, November 6, 2023.

(Abed Rahim Khatib/Flash90)</p>
</div>
<p><span>“Sometimes [the target] was at home earlier, and then at night he went to sleep somewhere else, say underground, and you didn’t know about it,” one of the sources said. “There are times when you double-check the location, and there are times when you just say, ‘Okay, he was in the house in the last few hours, so you can just bomb.’”</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Another source described a similar incident that affected him and made him want to be interviewed for this investigation. “We understood that the target was home at 8 p.m. In the end, the air force bombed the house at 3 a.m. Then we found out [in that span of time] he had managed to move himself to another house with his family. There were two other families with children in the building we bombed.”</span></p>
<p><span>In previous wars in Gaza, after the assassination of human targets, Israeli intelligence would carry out bomb damage assessment (BDA) procedures — a routine post-strike check to see if the senior commander was killed and how many civilians were killed along with him. As revealed in a </span><a href="https://www.972mag.com/gaza-soldiers-civilians-intelligence/"><span>previous +972 and Local Call investigation</span></a><span>, this involved listening in to phone calls of relatives who lost their loved ones. In the current war, however, at least in relation to junior militants marked using AI, sources say this procedure was abolished in order to save time. The sources said they did not know how many civilians were actually killed in each strike, and for the low-ranking suspected Hamas and PIJ operatives marked by AI, they did not even know whether the target himself was killed.</span></p>
<div>
<h3>Most read on +972</h3>

</div>
<p><span>“You don’t know exactly how many you killed, and who you killed,” an intelligence source </span><a href="https://twitter.com/yuval_abraham/status/1750123648533324158?lang=en"><span>told Local Call</span></a><span> for a previous investigation published in January. “Only when it’s senior Hamas operatives do you follow the BDA procedure. In the rest of the cases, you don’t care. You get a report from the air force about whether the building was blown up, and that’s it. You have no idea how much collateral damage there was; you immediately move on to the next target. The emphasis was to create as many targets as possible, as quickly as possible.”</span></p>
<p><span>But while the Israeli military may move on from each strike without dwelling on the number of casualties, Amjad Al-Sheikh, the Shuja’iya resident who lost 11 of his family members in the Dec. 2 bombardment, said that he and his neighbors are still searching for corpses.</span></p>
<p><span>“Until now, there are bodies under the rubble,” he said. “Fourteen residential buildings were bombed with their residents inside. Some of my relatives and neighbors are still buried.”</span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>Comment</span> Generally the head of US government agencies and comedy don't mix, but on Monday night Lina Khan, boss of the Federal Trade Commission, was on the Daily Show recounting how the agency is going after Amazon, Facebook and others over monopolistic practices. She also got evidence of her <em>persona non grata</em> status with Cook &amp; Co.</p>
<p>Khan was welcomed onto the telly news commentary show, chaired once again by Jon Stewart, with cheers from the crowd - again not something many US government officials hear. The exception to this is possibly Rob Joyce, the former White House cybersecurity coordinator and recently <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nsa.gov/Press-Room/Press-Releases-Statements/Press-Release-View/Article/3681065/national-security-agency-announces-retirement-of-cybersecurity-director/">retired</a> NSA cybersecurity director, who got a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2018/01/22/rob_joyce_hacking/">standing ovation</a> at the Shmoocon infosec conference after a presentation on how he hacks Christmas tree lights for fun.</p>
<p>In the 20-minute interview, Khan gave details on an ongoing lawsuit against Amazon's behavior - notably allegedly spamming search results pages and hiking fees on small businesses, which she said was "harming customers."</p>

    

<p>You can replay her appearance on the Comedy Central / Paramount+ / kinda YouTube program below.</p>

        


        

<p>
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaDTiWaYfcM" data-media="x-videoplayer">Youtube Video</a>
</p>
<p>It was going to be a tough fight, she said, since her watchdog agency has just 1,200 staff and Amazon has "monopoly money," and can throw ten times that number of lawyers at the case. "We're pretty out-gunned but not out-matched," she asserted.</p>

        

<p>But then Stewart dropped his bombshell: After a two-season podcast series with Apple he told Khan he wanted to get her on the show but Cupertino really wasn't keen.</p>
<p>"Apple asked us not to do it, to have you. They literally said 'please don't talk to her'... I didn't think they cared for you," Stewart said. Khan made an admirable, and nearly successful, attempt to keep a straight face.</p>
<p>Stewart also alleged that Apple refused to let his team make jokes about AI. He quit the podcast abruptly last October, reportedly citing Apple's heavy handed approach to censoring certain topics and guests.</p>

        

<p>"This just shows the dangers when you concentrate so much power and so much decision-making in a small number of companies," she argued.</p>
<p>"Going back all the way to the founding there was a recognition that in the same way that you need the Constitution to create checks and balances in our political sphere, you also needed the antitrust and anti-monopoly laws to safeguard against concentration of economic power because you don't want an autocrat of trade in the same way you don't want a monarch."</p>

</ul>
<p>The amount of consolidation in the tech industry is harming competition, she argued. The FTC's case against Meta (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/12/09/facebook_crushed_competitors_to_maintain/">started</a> before Khan got the top job) was a case in point - Facebook realized it couldn't defeat Instagram and WhatsApp, so just bought them, she asserted.</p>
<h3>So, how's that working out? Pretty good it seems</h3>
<p>When Khan <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/06/16/lina_khan_ftc/">was appointed</a> FTC chair in 2021 it must have sent shivers down the spine of many in the tech industry, particularly in Seattle.</p>
<p>Her 2017 <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/pdf/e.710.Khan.805_zuvfyyeh.pdf">paper</a> [PDF] titled "Amazon's antitrust paradox" lays out the case that too few players exert a disproportionate amount of power in the tech industry.</p>
<p>And while traditionally monopolies were thought of as a single company dominating the industry (<em>cough</em>, Microsoft in the 1990s), customers are still shafted if even a few businesses corner a market.</p>
<p>As an immigrant to Silicon Valley and the San Francisco Bay Area it is astonishing to this humble vulture that this free-market nation is anything but in so many areas. Though it depends on where one lives, good luck getting a decent, healthy choice of ISP or cellphone carrier. And for a region that is a major tech hub of America the internet speeds and prices came as a rude shock.</p>
<p>Coming from Europe where telcos fight for your business, the change was remarkable. This hack may have been somewhat terse with a Verizon staffer trying to tell me that paying for text messages (an engineering function that carries the most minimal of data loads) was cheap at the price of just $5 a month. But with so little choice such predatory pricing is possible.</p>
<p>So far, the FTC appears to be getting much more muscular in going after alleged monopolistic practices, and it's about time. Frankly it's insane that an agency with such an important role in ensuring fair and open markets has such tiny staffing levels and funding.</p>
<p>But while the regulator is small it does have legal powers, and is increasingly asserting them. The question is how far can they be pushed, and with what consequences.</p>
<p>On <em>The Register</em>, when folks get fined we generally cite the sometimes large figures involved as a proportion of current profit, to give some perspective. When the FTC imposed a $5bn fine on Facebook back in 2019 over the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2019/07/12/ftc_facebook_settlement_proposal/">Cambridge Analytica scandal</a>, for example, that amounted to one percent of its market cap. Zuckerberg must have been shaking in his sneakers.</p>
<p>And this was the point Khan made: "Over the last couple of decades we've seen how businesses can just treat fines as a cost of doing business. And we need to make sure we're actually deterring illegal behavior."</p>
<p>The Tl;dr: Businesses only obey the bottom line. ®</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.sequin.io/liveview-is-best-with-svelte/">https://blog.sequin.io/liveview-is-best-with-svelte/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39916144">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>We’re <a href="https://sequin.io/?ref=blog.sequin.io">Sequin</a>. We stream data from services like Salesforce, Stripe, and AWS to messaging systems like Kafka and databases like Postgres. As an infrastructure company, we questioned if we really need a SPA. So, we started with LiveView, which helped us move fast but left us wanting more. This post is about that journey.
</p>
<p>Phoenix's <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.html?ref=blog.sequin.io">LiveView</a> has polarized our team. Compared to SPA, there are components and features that we’re able to build 2-3x faster. Conversely, there are components and features that are frustrating to build or feel very counterintuitive.</p>
<p>Said another way, LiveView makes a lot of things easy. But it also makes some easy things hard.</p>
<p>This created tension. Do we keep forging down this path? Or do we give in and convert our app to a SPA?</p>
<p>Fortunately, we found a companion library called <a href="https://github.com/woutdp/live_svelte?ref=blog.sequin.io">LiveSvelte</a>. LiveView enables a development experience with Svelte that’s unlike any other fullstack paradigm I’ve used.</p>
<p>The team agrees: this is a killer way to build.</p>
<p>To appreciate the LiveView+Svelte paradigm, I’ll start by explaining how LiveView works and what makes it different. Then, I’ll detail the friction we encountered with a pure LiveView approach. At that point, you’ll be able to appreciate what LiveSvelte offers.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-liveview">What is LiveView</h2>
<p>LiveView offers a very unique way to build web applications.</p>
<p>In a traditional server-rendered web application, the server is stateless. The client requests a page and the server renders it. All client actions route back to the server, which re-renders the next page.</p>
<p>In a SPA, the client is in charge of building pages. It leverages a backend API to read and write data. Client apps are stateful (e.g. <code>useState</code> in React).</p>
<p>In LiveView, the server is in charge of rendering the page. But it’s stateful. Actions in the frontend are handled by the backend, but the server <em>incrementally</em> updates the DOM, much like in a SPA.</p>
<p>At a high-level, the reason a SPA is complex is because distributed systems are complex. Supporting a client JS app is supporting a microservice (and one that runs in a hostile, untrusted environment, no less!)</p>
<p>In <em>theory</em> your frontend app uses a backend REST API that <em>could</em> be used to support lots of different services and clients. In reality, the needs of your frontend app are unique. So your backend routes and controllers explode with functions that serve the needs of a single client.</p>
<p>If nothing else, this complexity just means shaving a lot of yaks. Each request requires a fair bit of plumbing on both the frontend and the backend. Callstacks can easily exceed half a dozen layers:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>onMount</code></li>
<li><code>await api.fetchUsers</code></li>
<li><code>parseResponse</code></li>
<li><code>Router.handle(/api/users)</code></li>
<li><code>AuthPlug.verify_cookie</code></li>
<li><code>UsersController.index</code></li>
<li><code>Users.list_for_org</code></li>
<li><code>ApiHelpers.prepare_response</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The promise of LiveView is that you get to create rich client-side experiences without the frontend microservice. You're back to the much simpler world where you can query the database in the function adjacent to the function that renders your table rows. If a new row comes in, you just need to push it to your table, and LiveView will update the client for you.</p>
<p>But in addition, you also get to enjoy building an app using the stateful paradigm of frontend frameworks. It's much easier and faster to build rich interaction patterns this way vs prior backend paradigms where you'd need to "rebuild the world" on each request.</p>
<h2 id="where-liveview-makes-easy-things-hard">Where LiveView makes easy things hard</h2>
<p>There's a lot of good stuff in LiveView. But there are also real thorns.</p>
<p>There are two primary areas that we struggled with LiveView:</p>
<h3 id="client-side-state-is-inevitable">Client-side state is inevitable</h3>
<p>There is a (literal) speed of light limitation with this approach: your server can only be <em>so close</em> to your users.</p>
<p>Invariably, you’re going to need to do some stuff client-side. Animations, tooltips, showing/hiding DOM elements, disabling form fields, etc.</p>
<p>For example, there’s a form in our app with two interdependent dropdowns. Selecting an option in the first dropdown allows our server to generate the list for the second dropdown. To get the best UX, you want to disable the second dropdown immediately after the first dropdown changes. Then, when it’s repopulated by the server, you can re-enable it:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.sequin.io/content/images/2024/03/CleanShot-2024-03-28-at-10.58.11-1.gif" alt="Two dropdowns, the second is disabled after the first changes">
</p>
<p><em>Simulating 1000ms of roundtrip latency between the client and the server.</em></p>
<p>To pull this off, as far as we could tell, you need to use two independent concepts in LiveView:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.JS.html?ref=blog.sequin.io">JS module</a> to disable the second dropdown when the first dropdown changes.</li>
<li>Use a <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/js-interop.html?ref=blog.sequin.io#client-hooks-via-phx-hook">hook</a> to register an event listener on the second dropdown. Then, send an action to re-enable the second dropdown from the backend.</li>
</ul>
<p>And for slightly more complex interaction patterns, you’ll need to incorporate a <em>third</em> concept, LiveView state. For example, maybe you only want to re-enable the second dropdown in certain conditions.</p>
<p>The way these three concepts fit together is not obvious (we’re still not sure this is the right pattern!)</p>
<p>So, while the server is in charge of a lot of DOM changes, it can’t command all of them. You use JS and hooks to sprinkle in JavaScript where needed. These tools feel side-chained to core LiveView, and therefore their patterns of use are not obvious. And the more JS and hooks you use, the more of your DOM state now exists <em>outside</em> of LiveView.</p>
<p>This is a stark contrast to a paradigm like React. In React, it’s state and actions all the way down. With that core concept, you can do most anything. And there is no blurry line between DOM state and component state.</p>
<p>React can take that approach because there’s no latency between client-side actions and client-side state. This means you can let React’s state paradigm handle every action and transition. Because all of LiveView’s state is server-side, it has to contend with the latency between client-side actions and server-side state. This means that while LiveView state <em>looks like</em> other frontend frameworks, the model is actually quite different.</p>
<p>Take input fields, for example. In React, a character can’t be inserted into an input field without routing through state. This unlocks a powerful programming model, where your component re-renders – and therefore responds – to every keystroke. It gives the state and action paradigm a lot of reach, where you can use one core concept (<code>useState</code>) to solve a huge space of problems.</p>
<p>In LiveView, it’s more accurate to say that the input field is changed by the user, <em>and then</em> a short while later LiveView finds out about it and reacts to it. With no latency, <em>it looks a lot like React</em>. But with increased latency, it’s quite a different paradigm.</p>
<p>In frontend frameworks like React, you need to contend with server-side latency all the time. But <em>when</em> a high-latency action is going to take place is clear (i.e. you’re fetching from a server). In LiveView, the boundary is murkier.</p>
<h3 id="three-components">Three components</h3>
<p>LiveView has three different types of components: LiveViews, LiveComponents, and Components.</p>
<p>LiveViews and LiveComponents are like stateful components in React, whereas Components are like functional components.</p>
<p>Importantly, a LiveView will always be the uppermost parent component. You render LiveComponents and Components as children underneath a LiveView.</p>
<p>In React, it's easy to switch between stateful and functional components–just add or remove <code>useState</code> hooks. The API for both are the same (they both accept props in the same way). And outside state, they have an identical feature set. For example, they can both register and respond to DOM events in the same way.</p>
<p>The ease of switching between component types is important. As an app matures, you’re constantly factoring out components. You’re figuring out which bits should be reused, what should be generalized, where state should live, etc.</p>
<p>In LiveView, all three components are very different. As a result, refactoring a LiveView into a LiveComponent is surprisingly cumbersome.</p>
<p>In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>The syntax for rendering and passing props to LiveViews and LiveComponents is different.</li>
<li>The lifecycle of LiveViews and LiveComponents are different.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveComponent.html?ref=blog.sequin.io#module-unifying-liveview-and-livecomponent-communication">communication options</a> between LiveViews and LiveComponents are different. For example, you <code>send</code> to LiveViews but <code>send_update</code> to LiveComponents.</li>
<li>LiveComponents are not processes, and so can't interact with the rest of the system like LiveViews can.</li>
</ul>
<p>That last point is what makes LiveComponents so different and so frustrating. The limitations <em>make sense</em>: A LiveView is a process. That's one of the best parts about a LiveView, they're "just processes" and so they can fit into your Elixir/OTP system like every other process. For example, you can use pub/sub in a LiveView to subscribe to system-wide changes.</p>
<p>A LiveComponent is <em>not</em> its own process, they are modules invoked by a LiveView. The parent LiveView process holds the state for all subcomponents. So, a LiveView has a <code>pid</code>, state, and an inbox; a LiveComponent does not. This means the LiveView also has to handle all message routing for its child LiveComponents.</p>
<p>This is in keeping with Elixir/OTP design principles: processes are the building blocks. To give LiveComponents the same powers of independent state management and action handling, they would each need to be their own process.</p>
<p>Still, for the life of me, I <em>really</em> struggled with LiveComponents. So often, I wanted to send my LiveComponent an event/action but didn't have a good way to do it. You end up using <code>send_update</code>, which is an awkward API. We couldn't decide: do we send <em>actions</em> via <code>send_update</code>, or do we use it to patch state? If we use it to patch state, how do we tell in our <code>update</code> clause whether we're mounting or updating?</p>
<h2 id="the-elusive-%E2%80%9Cliveview-way%E2%80%9D">The elusive “LiveView way”</h2>
<p>LiveView often made us feel like we were “missing something.” The “LiveView way” feels elusive.</p>
<p>Perhaps LiveView is in an uncanny valley. It shares a lot in common with contemporary frontend frameworks. So, our “React brains” and intuitions would kick in, driving us to use old patterns–but those would often lead to a dead end. More alienness would have forced us to recognize the differences and to approach problems differently.</p>
<p>You can do a lot with just LiveView state and actions. But there are limits, and when you hit them you need to switch paradigms.</p>
<p>It has components to help you organize and reuse code. But due to differences between JavaScript and Elixir, LiveView can’t really offer the same isomorphic component trees without a ton of abstraction, and so has LiveViews and LiveComponents.</p>
<p><strong>This is what makes LiveSvelte so promising</strong>. As you’ll see, it shifts more responsibility to the frontend. It embraces the fact that the frontend will have its own state. And it lets you take advantage of all the maturity of contemporary JavaScript component frameworks.</p>
<h2 id="liveview-svelte">LiveView + Svelte</h2>
<p>LiveSvelte lets you render Svelte components from LiveView. It's an awesome paradigm.</p>
<p>There’s a couple different ways to render Svelte from your LiveViews, but the most basic way looks like this:</p>
<pre><code># LiveView component
defmodule Web.SyncLive.Form do
  def render(assigns) do
    assigns = 
      assigns
      |&gt; Map.put(:encoded_collections, Enum.map(assigns.collections, &amp;encode_collection/1))
      |&gt; Map.put(:encoded_errors, encode_errors(assigns.changeset))
  
    ~H"""
      &lt;.svelte
        name="MyForm"
        props={
          %{
            collections: @encoded_collections,
            credential_options: @credential_options,
            errors: @encoded_errors,
          }
        }
        socket={@socket}
      /&gt;
    """
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>This is an Elixir module, the LiveView. Inside the render, we first take our Elixir data structures and encode them for the frontend. We like the pattern of explicitly encoding Elixir structs and such as plain maps before passing to Svelte, like this:</p>
<pre><code>  defp encode_collection(%Collection{} = collection) do
    %{
      "id" =&gt; collection.id,
      "slug" =&gt; collection.slug,
      "name" =&gt; collection.name
    }
  end
</code></pre>
<p>We’re able to set props on the Svelte component. Those are passed down as you’d expect to the component:</p>
<pre><code>// Svelte component
&lt;script&gt;
  export let resource;
  export let credential_options = [];
  export let errors = {};
  export let live;
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>One of the props that LiveSvelte sets for us is the <code>live</code> prop. To communicate from the Svelte component back up to the LiveView, we can call <code>live.pushEvent</code>. For example, check how easy it is to send the server changes to the form:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;
  // ...
  $: {
    live.pushEvent("form_updated", { form }, () =&gt; {});
  }
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This is a reactive block in Svelte. It will be executed whenever the variable <code>form</code> is changed. (Kind of like a <code>useEffect</code>, where <code>form</code> is the dependency.)</p>
<p>The LiveView can handle and respond to the <code>pushEvent</code> using typical Elixir message handling semantics:</p>
<pre><code># In the LiveView
# ...
  @impl LiveView
  def handle_event("form_updated", %{"form" =&gt; form}, socket) do
    params = decode_params(socket, form)
    {:noreply, merge_changeset(socket, params)}
  end
  
  defp merge_changeset(socket, params) do
    changeset = Collection.create_changeset(socket.assigns.resource, params)

    assign(socket, :changeset, changeset)
  end
</code></pre>
<p>We first decode the params from the frontend, reversing any encoding/mapping we did on the way out. Then, <code>merge_changeset/2</code> updates our changeset. If there are any validation errors in the changeset, those will make their way back to the frontend via the <code>errors</code> prop.</p>
<p>So, you have data flow from Elixir down to the component via props. The LiveView process can update props at any time to cause the Svelte component to re-render. Any other communication can happen via the websocket.</p>
<p>The boundary between the two is very clear–just as clear as in any SPA.</p>
<p>What's most game-changing, though, is that you have a <em>backend, stateful process</em> that is collaborating with a <em>frontend, stateful process</em>.</p>
<p>And it's <em>so</em> fun and productive.</p>
<p>The three powerhouse properties:</p>
<ol>
<li>The backend controls the props on the frontend component.</li>
<li>The frontend <em>and</em> the backend are stateful.</li>
<li>You have a private, bi-directional communication channel between the two <em>where either side can initiate a message to the other</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>#1 is made possible thanks to LiveView’s rendering paradigm: re-renders on the server are automatically pushed and applied to the client. This lets the server update props on the component just like a JS parent component can!</p>
<p>#2 is possible because a LiveView is a process. Processes are how Elixir encapsulates and reduces state.</p>
<p>#3 is made possible by the persistent websocket that LiveView gives you, wired to the frontend.</p>
<p>Consider the differences between this paradigm and a SPA:</p>
<p>First, all browser routing happens via the backend. This is a great simplifier. (In a regular SPA you have to maintain <em>two</em> sets of routes, one for the browser and one for your API.)</p>
<p>Second, the backend is stateful. It knows what route you’re on. Which resource you’re working with. Each action it handles can be far more incremental, as it’s applying a state change to itself vs rebuilding state from scratch.</p>
<p>Third, communication between the frontend and backend is private and coupled, as it should be. You’re not “polluting” your server’s public routes with a bunch of RPC calls that support a single component. When you see a <code>pushEvent</code> in the client, you know exactly where the handler for that is – in the collaborating Elixir module.</p>
<p>Fourth, functionality is split across just two files. Sure, the backend module will call out to your backend functions (e.g. fetch data from database) and the frontend will import components and styles. But roundtrips between the two aren’t routing through a stack of API modules, routers, and controllers.</p>
<p>Fifth, communication between frontend and backend is far less ceremonious. The backend can simply update props to inform frontend changes. And the frontend can <code>pushEvent</code> without needing handlers for expired tokens, timeouts, or outages. It’s binary: either the websocket is open which means the server is open for business, or it’s not in which case LiveView helpfully shows the user a global “disconnected” banner.</p>
<p>In the simplest terms, the frontend microservice is eliminated.</p>
<p>What you end up with feels like such a great split of responsibilities with very little boilerplate. All your business logic is on the backend – how you load data, <em>which</em> data to load, how to sort and filter the data, your validators, etc. Your frontend code is stupid simple. In Svelte, it’s all (1) <code>if/end</code> blocks to conditionally render stuff (2) animations and (3) a few dead simple <code>pushEvent</code> functions back to the server.</p>
<p>That last part has been blowing my mind. The typical SPA frontend is full of so much logic, usually <code>map</code>, <code>reduce</code>, and <code>filter</code> in order to process server data, prepare data for display, or prepare data for the server. In a LiveSvelte app, all this can just happen server-side. The LiveView can prepare data exactly as the Svelte component needs it. This keeps complexity in your server language, in your server's data structures, and in your server's test suite.</p>
<p>The backend LiveView and the frontend Svelte component aren't so much coupled as they are two halves: the LiveView only renders that Svelte component, and that Svelte component is only ever rendered by that LiveView.</p>
<p>In contrast to a “regular” LiveView, this paradigm:</p>
<ul>
<li>Embraces state and state transitions in the frontend.</li>
<li>Creates a clear boundary layer between the frontend and backend.</li>
<li>Leverages Svelte’s component paradigm, which like other contemporary JS frameworks is very mature and familiar.</li>
<li>In general, lets great frontend frameworks do what they do best! A pure LiveView approach doesn’t let you tap into this huge ecosystem. (For example, Svelte comes with great animation primitives.)</li>
</ul>
<p>By moving more into the frontend, we no longer felt like we were straddling an awkward middleground.</p>
<p>We chose LiveSvelte because React didn't have a similarly complete LiveView library. The joy of working with Svelte has been a very happy bonus. Because LiveView does the heavy lifting with state management, our state management in Svelte is very simple. For basic state and reactivity, Svelte is the lightest and fastest frontend framework I've worked with. We also prefer its templating features to React's, namely getting to use <code>if/else</code> instead of ternary operators and its conditional property setting.</p>
<p>Further, Svelte 5 is around the corner, and we're bullish on its <a href="https://svelte.dev/blog/runes?ref=blog.sequin.io">runes</a>. We think it makes Svelte even easier to pick up and reason about, meaning everyone on the team is empowered to traverse the stack.</p>
<p>I’m now convinced LiveView shines brightest as a backend-for-frontend. By rendering frontend components, incrementally updating them, maintaining a stateful backend process, and providing a websocket API, it creates a tremendously productive platform for frontend applications.</p>
<p>If you’re using LiveView and resonated with any of the friction I highlighted, you need to give this a try. If you’ve never used LiveView, you’ll find that this paradigm <em>lowers</em> the learning curve. This is because you’re able to use a lot of the JavaScript framework primitives you’re used to.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>You've just made a class.
You made a <code>__init__</code> method.
Now what?</p>
<p>Python includes <em>tons</em> of <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/what-are-dunder-methods/" target="_blank">dunder methods</a> ("double underscore" methods) which allow us to deeply customize how our custom classes interact with Python's many features.
What dunder methods could you add to your class to make it friendly for other Python programmers who use it?</p>
<p>Let's take a look at <strong>every dunder method in Python</strong>, with a focus on when each method is useful.</p>
<p>Note that the Python documentation refers to these as <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-special-method" target="_blank">special methods</a> and notes the synonym "magic method" but <em>very</em> <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#reserved-classes-of-identifiers" target="_blank">rarely</a> uses the term "dunder method".
However, "dunder method" is a fairly common Python colloquialism, as noted in my <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/terms/" target="_blank">unofficial Python glossary</a>.</p>
<p>You can use the links scattered throughout this page for more details on any particular dunder method.
For a list of all of them, see the cheat sheet in the final section.</p>
<div>
<p><a href="#cheat-sheet">Just show me the cheat sheet</a>
</p></div>
<h2 id="the-3-essential-dunder-methods">The 3 essential dunder methods 🔑</h2>
<p>There are 3 dunder methods that <em>most</em> classes should have: <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/what-is-init/" target="_blank"><code>__init__</code></a>, <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/customizing-string-representation-your-objects/" target="_blank"><code>__repr__</code></a>, and <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/overloading-equality-in-python/" target="_blank"><code>__eq__</code></a>.</p>

<thead>
<tr>
<th>Operation</th>

<td><code>str</code></td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>The <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/what-is-init/" target="_blank"><code>__init__</code></a> method is the <strong>initializer</strong> (not to be confused with the <a href="#construction-and-finalizing" target="_blank">constructor</a>), the <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/customizing-string-representation-your-objects/" target="_blank"><code>__repr__</code></a> method customizes an object's string representation, and the <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/overloading-equality-in-python/" target="_blank"><code>__eq__</code></a> method customizes what it means for objects to be <em>equal</em> to one another.</p>
<p>The <code>__repr__</code> method is particularly helpful at the <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/using-the-python-repl/" target="_blank">the Python REPL</a> and when debugging.</p>
<h2 id="equality-and-hashability">Equality and hashability 🟰</h2>
<p>In addition to the <code>__eq__</code> method, Python has 2 other dunder methods for determining the "value" of an object in relation to other objects.</p>

<p>Python's <code>__eq__</code> method typically returns <code>True</code>, <code>False</code>, or <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/when-to-use-notimplemented/" target="_blank"><code>NotImplemented</code></a> (if objects can't be compared).
The default <code>__eq__</code> implementation relies on the <code>is</code> operator, which checks for <strong><a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/equality-vs-identity/" target="_blank">identity</a></strong>.</p>
<p>The default implementation of <code>__ne__</code> calls <code>__eq__</code> and negates any boolean return value given (or returns <code>NotImplemented</code> if <code>__eq__</code> did).
This default behavior is usually "good enough", so <strong>you'll almost never see <code>__ne__</code> implemented</strong>.</p>
<p>Hashable objects can be used as keys in dictionaries or values in sets.
All objects in Python are <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/what-are-hashable-objects/" target="_blank">hashable</a> by default, but if you've written a custom <code>__eq__</code> method then your objects <em>won't</em> be hashable without a custom <code>__hash__</code> method.
But <strong>the hash value of an object must never change</strong> or <a href="https://pym.dev/p/2ysgz/" target="_blank">bad things will happen</a> so <strong>typically only <em>immutable</em> objects implement <code>__hash__</code></strong>.</p>

<p>Python's comparison operators (<code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>) can all be overloaded with dunder methods as well.
The comparison operators also power functions that rely on the relative ordering of objects, like <code>sorted</code>, <code>min</code>, and <code>max</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>__bool__</code> function is used for <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/truthiness/" target="_blank">truthiness</a> checks, though <code>__len__</code> is used as a fallback.</p>
<p>If you needed to make an object that acts like a number (like <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html" target="_blank"><code>decimal.Decimal</code></a> or <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/fractions.html" target="_blank"><code>fractions.Fraction</code></a>), you'll want to implement <code>__int__</code>, <code>__float__</code>, and <code>__complex__</code> so your objects can be converted to other numbers.
If you wanted to make an object that could be used in a <code>memoryview</code> or could otherwise be converted to <code>bytes</code>, you'll want a <code>__bytes__</code> method.</p>
<p>The <code>__format__</code> and <code>__repr__</code> methods are different string conversion flavors.
Most string conversions rely the <code>__str__</code> method, but the default <code>__str__</code> implementation simply calls <code>__repr__</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>__format__</code> method is used by all <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/string-formatting/" target="_blank">f-string conversions</a>, by the <code>str</code> class's <code>format</code> method, and by the (rarely used) built-in <code>format</code> function.

<p>The <code>__iter__</code> method is used by the <code>iter</code> function <em>and</em> for all forms of iteration: <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/writing-a-for-loop/" target="_blank"><code>for</code> loops</a>, <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/what-are-list-comprehensions/" target="_blank">comprehensions</a>, <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/tuple-unpacking/" target="_blank">tuple unpacking</a>, and <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/unpacking-iterables-iterables/" target="_blank">using <code>*</code> for iterable unpacking</a>.</p>
<p>While the <code>__iter__</code> method is necessary for creating a custom iterable, the <code>__next__</code> method is necessary for creating a custom iterator (which is much less common).
The <code>__missing__</code> method is only ever called by the <code>dict</code> class on itself, unless another class decides to implement <code>__missing__</code>.
The <code>__length_hint__</code> method supplies a length guess for structures which do not support <code>__len__</code> so that lists or other structures can be pre-sized more efficiently.</p>

<h2 id="arithmetic-operators">Arithmetic operators ➗</h2>
<p>Python's dunder methods are often described as a tool for "operator overloading".
Most of this "operator overloading" comes in the form of Python's various arithmetic operators.</p>
<p>There are two ways to break down the arithmetic operators:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mathematical (e.g. <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>%</code>) versus bitwise (e.g. <code>&amp;</code>, <code>|</code>, <code>^</code>, <code>&gt;&gt;</code>, <code>~</code>)</li>
<li>Binary (between 2 values, like <code>x + y</code>) versus unary (before 1 value, like <code>+x</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The mathematical operators are much more common than the bitwise ones and the binary ones are a bit more common than the unary ones.</p>
<p>These are the binary mathematical arithmetic operators:</p>

<p>The unary <code>+</code> operator typically <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16819023/whats-the-purpose-of-the-pos-unary-operator-in-python" target="_blank">has no effect</a>, though some objects use it for a specific operation.
For example <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/using-counter/#removing-negative-counts" target="_blank">using <code>+</code> on <code>collections.Counter</code> objects</a> will remove non-positive values.</p>
<p>Python's arithmetic operators are often used for non-arithmetic ends: <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/sequence/" target="_blank">sequences</a> use <code>+</code> to concatenate and <code>*</code> to self-concatenate and <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/practical-uses-of-sets/" target="_blank">sets</a> use <code>&amp;</code> for intersection, <code>|</code> for union, <code>-</code> for asymmetric difference, and <code>^</code> for symmetric difference.
Arithmetic operators are sometimes overloaded for more creative uses too.
For example, <code>pathlib.Path</code> objects <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#operators" target="_blank">use <code>/</code> to create child paths</a>.</p>
<h2 id="in-place-arithmetic-operations">In-place arithmetic operations ♻️</h2>

<p>All of Python's binary arithmetic operators work in <strong>augmented assignment statements</strong>, which involve using an operator followed by the <code>=</code> sign to assign to an object while performing an operation on it.</p>
<p>Augmented assignments on <strong>mutable objects</strong> are <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/augmented-assignments-mutate/" target="_blank">expected to mutate the original object</a>, thanks to the mutable object implementing the appropriate dunder method for in-place arithmetic.</p>
<p>When no dunder method is found for an in-place operation, Python performs the operation followed by an assignment.
<strong>Immutable objects typically do <em>not</em> implement dunder methods for in-place operations</strong>, since they should return a new object instead of changing the original.</p>
<h2 id="built-in-math-functions">Built-in math functions 🧮</h2>

<p>Python's <code>divmod</code> function performs <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/integer-division/" target="_blank">integer division</a> (<code>//</code>) and a modulo operation (<code>%</code>) at the same time.
Note that, just like the many binary arithmetic operators, <code>divmod</code> will also check for an <code>__rvidmod__</code> method if it needs to ask the <em>second</em> argument to handle the operation.</p>
<p>The <code>__index__</code> method is for making integer-like objects.
This method losslessly converts to an integer, unlike <code>__int__</code> which may perform a "lossy" integer conversion (e.g. from <code>float</code> to <code>int</code>).
It's used by operations that require <em>true</em> integers, such as <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/slicing/" target="_blank">slicing</a>, indexing, and <code>bin</code>, <code>hex</code>, and <code>oct</code> functions (<a href="https://pym.dev/p/2k9zt/" target="_blank">example</a>).</p>

<p>The <code>__getattribute__</code> method is called for <em>every</em> attribute access, while the <code>__getattr__</code> method is only called after Python <em>fails</em> to find a given attribute.
All method calls and attribute accesses call <code>__getattribute__</code> so implementing it correctly is challenging (due to accidental <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/what-is-recursion/" target="_blank">recursion</a>).</p>
<p>The <code>__dir__</code> method should return an iterable of attribute names (as strings).
When <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/built-in-functions-in-python/#dir" target="_blank">the <code>dir</code> function</a> calls <code>__dir__</code>, it converts the returned iterable into a sorted list (like <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/sorting-in-python/" target="_blank"><code>sorted</code></a> does).</p>
<p>The built-in <code>getattr</code>, <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/python-setattr/" target="_blank"><code>setattr</code></a>, and <code>delattr</code> functions correspond to the dunder methods of the same name, but they're only intended for dynamic attribute access (not <em>all</em> attribute accesses).</p>

<p>Now we're getting into the really unusual dunder methods.
Python includes many dunder methods for metaprogramming-related features.</p>

<p>The <code>__prepare__</code> method customizes the dictionary that's used for a class's initial namespace.
This is used to pre-populate dictionary values or customize the dictionary type (<a href="https://pym.dev/p/23wfv/" target="_blank">silly example</a>).</p>
<p>The <code>__instancecheck__</code> and <code>__subclasscheck__</code> methods override the functionality of <code>isinstance</code> and <code>issubclass</code>.
Python's ABCs use these to practice <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/goose-typing/" target="_blank">goose typing</a> (<a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/duck-typing/" target="_blank">duck typing</a> <em>while</em> type checking).</p>
<p>The <code>__init_subclass__</code> method allows classes to hook into subclass initialization (<a href="https://pym.dev/p/246z6/" target="_blank">example</a>).
Classes <em>also</em> have a <code>__subclasses__</code> method (on their <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-metaclass" target="_blank">metaclass</a>) but it's not typically overridden.</p>
<p>Python calls <code>__mro_entries__</code> during <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/inheriting-one-class-another/" target="_blank">class inheritance</a> for any base classes that are not <em>actually</em> classes.
The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.NamedTuple" target="_blank"><code>typing.NamedTuple</code></a> function uses this to pretend it's a class (<a href="https://pym.dev/p/2qgzd/" target="_blank">see here</a>).</p>
<p>The <code>__class_getitem__</code> method allows a class to be subscriptable (<em>without</em> its metaclass needing a <code>__getitem__</code> method).
This is typically used for enabling fancy type annotations (e.g. <code>list[int]</code>).</p>
<h2 id="descriptors">Descriptors 🏷️</h2>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-descriptor" target="_blank">Descriptors</a> are objects that, when attached to a class, can hook into the access of the attribute name they're attached to on that class.</p>

<p>The <code>__release_buffer__</code> method is called when the buffer that's returned from <code>__buffer__</code> is deleted.</p>
<p>Python's buffer protocol is typically implemented in C, since it's meant for low level objects.</p>
<h2 id="asynchronous-operations">Asynchronous operations 🤹</h2>
<p>Want to implement an asynchronous context manager?
You need these dunder methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>__aenter__</code>: just like <code>__enter__</code>, but it returns an awaitable object</li>
<li><code>__aexit__</code>: just like <code>__exit__</code>, but it returns an awaitable object</li>
</ul>
<p>Need to support asynchronous iteration?
You need these dunder methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>__aiter__</code>: must return an asynchronous iterator</li>
<li><code>__anext__</code>: like <code>__next__</code> or non-async iterators, but this must return an awaitable object and this should raise <code>StopAsyncIteration</code> instead of <code>StopIteration</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Need to make your own awaitable object?
You need this dunder method:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>__await__</code>: returns an iterator</li>
</ul>
<p>I have little experience with custom asynchronous objects, so look elsewhere for more details.</p>

<p>Calling a class returns a new class instance thanks to the <code>__new__</code> method.
The <code>__new__</code> method is Python's <strong>constructor method</strong>, though unlike constructors in many programming languages, you should almost <em>never</em> define your own <code>__new__</code> method.
To control object creation, prefer the initializer (<code>__init__</code>), not the constructor (<code>__new__</code>).
<a href="https://pym.dev/p/28r9m/" target="_blank">Here's an odd <code>__new__</code> example</a>.</p>
<p>You could think of <code>__del__</code> as a "destructor" method, though it's actually called the <strong>finalizer method</strong>.
Just before an object is deleted, its <code>__del__</code> method is called (<a href="https://pym.dev/p/2hexg/" target="_blank">example</a>).
Files implement a <code>__del__</code> method that closes the file and any binary file buffer that it may be linked to.</p>
<h2 id="library-specific-dunder-methods">Library-specific dunder methods 🧰</h2>
<p>Some standard library modules define custom dunder methods that aren't used anywhere else:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/dataclasses/" target="_blank">dataclasses</a> support a <code>__post_init__</code> method</li>
<li><code>abc.ABC</code> classes have a <code>__subclasshook__</code> method which <code>abc.ABCMeta</code> calls in its <code>__subclasscheck__</code> method (more in <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/goose-typing/" target="_blank">goose typing</a>)</li>
<li>Path-like objects have a <code>__fspath__</code> method, which returns the file path as a string</li>
<li>Python's <code>copy</code> module will use the <code>__copy__</code> and <code>__deepcopy__</code> methods if present</li>
<li>Pickling relies on <code>__getnewargs_ex__</code> or <code>__getargs__</code>, though <code>__getstate__</code> and <code>__setstate__</code> can customize further and <code>__reduce__</code> or <code>__reduce_ex__</code> are even lower-level</li>
<li><code>sys.getsizeof</code> relies on the <code>__sizeof__</code> method to get an object's size (in bytes)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dunder-attributes">Dunder attributes 📇</h2>
<p>In addition to dunder methods, Python has many non-method <strong>dunder attributes</strong>.</p>
<p>Here are some of the more common dunder attributes you'll see:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>__name__</code>: name of a function, classes, or module</li>
<li><code>__module__</code>: module name for a function or class</li>
<li><code>__doc__</code>: <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/docstrings/" target="_blank">docstring</a> for a function, class, or module</li>
<li><code>__class__</code>: an object's class (call <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/built-in-functions-in-python/#type" target="_blank">Python's <code>type</code> function</a> instead)</li>
<li><code>__dict__</code>: most objects store their attributes here (see <a href="https://www.pythonmorsels.com/where-are-attributes-stored/" target="_blank">where are attributes stored?</a>)</li>
<li><code>__slots__</code>: classes using this are more memory efficient than classes using <code>__dict__</code></li>
<li><code>__match_args__</code>: classes can define a tuple noting the significance of positional attributes when the class is used in structural pattern matching (<code>match</code>-<code>case</code>)</li>
<li><code>__mro__</code>: a class's method resolution order used when for attribute lookups and <code>super()</code> calls</li>
<li><code>__bases__</code>: the direct parent classes of a class</li>
<li><code>__file__</code>: the file that defined the module object (though not always present!)</li>
<li><code>__wrapped__</code>: functions decorated with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.wraps" target="_blank"><code>functools.wraps</code></a> use this to point to the original function</li>
<li><code>__version__</code>: commonly used for noting the version of a package</li>
<li><code>__all__</code>: modules can use this to customize the behavior of <code>from my_module import *</code></li>
<li><code>__debug__</code>: running Python with <code>-O</code> sets this to <code>False</code> and disables Python's <code>assert</code> statements</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are only the more commonly seen dunder attributes.
Here are some more:</p>
<ul>
<li>Functions have <code>__defaults__</code>, <code>__kwdefaults__</code>, <code>__code__</code>, <code>__globals__</code>, and <code>__closure__</code></li>
<li>Both functions and classes have <code>__qualname__</code>, <code>__annotations__</code>, and <code>__type_params__</code></li>
<li>Instance methods have <code>__func__</code> and <code>__self__</code></li>
<li>Modules may also have <code>__loader__</code>, <code>__package__</code>, <code>__spec__</code>, and <code>__cached__</code> attributes</li>
<li>Packages have a <code>__path__</code> attribute</li>
<li>Exceptions have <code>__traceback__</code>, <code>__notes__</code>, <code>__context__</code>, <code>__cause__</code>, and <code>__suppress_context__</code></li>
<li>Descriptors use <code>__objclass__</code></li>
<li>Metaclasses use <code>__classcell__</code></li>
<li>Python's <code>weakref</code> module uses <code>__weakref__</code></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#type-annotation-types-generic-alias-union" target="_blank">Generic aliases</a> have <code>__origin__</code>, <code>__args__</code>, <code>__parameters__</code>, and <code>__unpacked__</code></li>
<li>The <code>sys</code> module has <code>__stdout__</code> and <code>__stderr__</code> which point to the original <code>stdout</code> and <code>stderr</code> versions</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, these dunder attributes are used by various standard library modules: <code>__covariant__</code>, <code>__contravariant__</code>, <code>__infer_variance__</code>, <code>__bound__</code>, <code>__constraints__</code>.
And Python includes a built-in <code>__import__</code> function which you're not supposed to use (<code>importlib.import_module</code> is preferred) and CPython has a <code>__builtins__</code> variable that points to the <code>builtins</code> module (but this is an implementation detail and <code>builtins</code> should be explicitly imported when needed instead).
Also importing from the <code>__future__</code> module can enable specific Python feature flags and Python will look for a <code>__main__</code> module within packages to make them runnable as CLI scripts.</p>
<p>And that's just <em>most</em> of the dunder attribute names you'll find floating around in Python. 😵</p>

<p>The above table has a slight but consistent <em>untruth</em>.
Most of these dunder methods are not <em>actually</em> called on an object directly but are instead called on the <em>type</em> of that object: <code>type(x).__add__(x, y)</code> instead of <code>x.__add__(y)</code>.
This distinction mostly matters with metaclass methods.</p>
<p>I've also purposely excluded library-specific dunder methods (like <code>__post_init__</code>) and dunder methods you're unlikely to ever define (like <code>__subclasses__</code>).
See those below.</p>

<p>So, Python includes 103 "normal" dunder methods, 12 library-specific dunder methods, and at least 52 other dunder attributes of various types.
That's over 150 unique <code>__dunder__</code> names!
I <strong>do not recommend</strong> memorizing these: let Python do its job and look up the dunder method or attribute that you need to implement/find whenever you need it.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that <strong>you're not meant to invent your own dunder methods</strong>.
Sometimes you'll see third-party libraries that <em>do</em> invent their own dunder method, but this isn't encouraged and it can be quite confusing for users who run across such methods and assume they're "<em>real</em>" dunder methods.</p>

  <h5>April 3, 2024</h5>



  

  



<p>The Redict community is pleased to announce the release of Redict 7.3.0, the
first stable version of our copyleft fork of Redis® OSS 7.2.4.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> You can
download the release <a href="https://codeberg.org/redict/redict/releases/tag/7.3.0">on Codeberg</a>, or download one of our official
<a href="https://redict.io/docs/install/containers/">container images</a> from registry.redict.io.</p>
<p>We have written comprehensive documentation detailing our <a href="https://redict.io/docs/redis-compat/">compatibility with
Redis® OSS 7.2.4</a>, which also provides detailed documentation for
various migration scenarios, such as for users of the official Redis®
containers on Docker Hub, downstream package maintainers, and so on.</p>
<p>We have tested Redict thoroughly with a variety of migration scenarios, but we
may have missed a detail that pertains to your use-case. If you have any issues
or questions with respect to the migration process, please <a href="https://redict.io/docs/community">join our community
spaces</a> to get help.</p>
<h2 id="why-redict">
  Why Redict?
  <a href="#why-redict">#</a>
</h2>
<p>You may be wondering why Redict would be of interest to you, particularly when
compared with <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/linux-foundation-launches-open-source-valkey-community">Valkey</a>, another Redis® fork that was announced on Thursday.</p>
<p>In technical terms, we are focusing on stability and long-term maintenance, and
on achieving excellence within our current scope. We believe that Redict is near
feature-complete and that it is more valuable to our users if we take a
conservative stance to innovation and focus on long-term reliability instead.
This is in part a choice we’ve made to distinguish ourselves from Valkey, whose
commercial interests are able to invest more resources into developing more
radical innovations, but also an acknowledgement of a cultural difference
between our projects, in that the folks behind Redict place greater emphasis on
software with a finite scope and ambitions towards long-term stability
rather than focusing on long-term growth in scope and complexity.</p>
<p>We will happily pull useful changes from software with permissive licenses, such
as Valkey, to improve Redict; such is the value of permissive software and the
key advantage of free software generally. However, we will do so at a more
conservative pace, so that our users can enjoy stability first and shiny new
features second. We are also going to focus on establishing and maintaining a
good relationship with downstream distributions, prioritizing their needs with
respect to tasks such as de-vendoring Lua and jemalloc.</p>
<p>Redict also has social and political aims which differ from other forks. In
short, we believe in an approach which is built from an independent, grassroots,
and community-focused means of building our software. We are not governed by the
consensus of a small group of commercial interests, but rather by an independent
and community-driven consensus. Importantly, we have also chosen to protect our
software from further exploitation by applying the Lesser GNU General Public
License (LGPL) to our work.</p>
<p>Our choice of license prevents the hard work of our contributors from being
incorporated into the now-proprietary Redis® software, and from any future
attempts to create proprietary distributions of Redict. However, our choice of
the LGPL balances this concern with the needs of commercial users&nbsp;– we
have selected this license in part to ensure that cloud providers can continue
to offer Redict to their customers without being subject to onerous compliance
regimes.</p>
<blockquote>
  <strong>Note</strong>: Check out our <a href="https://redict.io/docs/license">About the license</a> page for more
information about the license of Redict.
</blockquote>

<p>We’ve made these choices because we believe they are essential in providing for
a future which is based on free software, and in which the rug cannot be pulled
out from under our users and contributors again. We believe it is essential to
make these choices now, at the onset of our fork, especially in response to the
crisis that the Redis® community is faced with at the hands of its
commercial stewards. If you don’t want your investment in this software to risk
another artificial crisis in the name of profit, if you want to enjoy the
protection of copyleft and a guarantee that your software will remain free, then
we encourage you to adopt Redict for your needs.</p>
<p>We have also taken this opportunity to re-evaluate our infrastructure and double
down on using free software. Rather than continuing to use the proprietary
GitHub forge, we have elected to use the non-profit, free software
<a href="https://codeberg.org/">Codeberg</a> as our home, and we run our continuous
integration on <a href="https://sourcehut.org/">SourceHut</a>, which is also free software.
Moreover, rather than gathering on Discord, we have chosen instead to set up our
community on <a href="https://redict.io/docs/community">Matrix and IRC</a>. We believe that the Redis® license
change provides us an opportunity to focus on our values as members of the free
software community, to exercise solidarity, and to lend our strength to
re-enforce the broader free software ecosystem. As such, we felt it important to
choose free software solutions for our infrastructure needs.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article class="page">







<section id="pagebody" role="main">
<p>Was the ssh backdoor the only goal that "Jia Tan" was pursuing
with their multi-year operation against xz?</p>

<p>I doubt it, and if not, then every fix so far has been incomplete,
because everything is still running code written by that entity.</p>

<p>If we assume that they had a multilayered plan, that their every action was
calculated and malicious, then we have to think about the full threat
surface of using xz. This quickly gets into nightmare scenarios of the
"trusting trust" variety.</p>

<p>What if xz contains a hidden buffer overflow or other vulnerability, that
can be exploited by the xz file it's decompressing? This would let the
attacker target other packages, as needed.</p>

<p>Let's say they want to target gcc. Well, gcc contains a lot of
documentation, which includes png images. So they spend a while getting
accepted as a documentation contributor on that project, and get added to
it a png file that is specially constructed, it has additional binary data
appended that exploits the buffer overflow. And instructs xz to modify the
source code that comes later when decompressing <code>gcc.tar.xz</code>.</p>

<p>More likely, they wouldn't bother with an actual trusting trust attack on
gcc, which would be a lot of work to get right. One problem with the ssh
backdoor is that well, not all servers on the internet run ssh. (Or
systemd.) So webservers seem a likely target of this kind of second stage
attack. Apache's docs include png files, nginx does not, but there's always
scope to add improved documentation to a project.</p>

<p>When would such a vulnerability have been introduced? In February, "Jia
Tan" wrote a <a href="https://git.tukaani.org/?p=xz.git;a=commitdiff;h=de5c5e417645ad8906ef914bc059d08c1462fc29">new decoder for xz</a>.
This added 1000+ lines of new C code across several commits. So much code
and in just the right place to insert something like this. And why take on
such a significant project just two months before inserting the ssh
backdoor? "Jia Tan" was already fully accepted as maintainer, and doing
lots of other work, it doesn't seem to me that they needed to start this
rewrite as part of their cover.</p>

<p>They were working closely with xz's author Lasse Collin in this, by
indications exchanging patches offlist as they developed it. So Lasse
Collin's commits in this time period are also worth scrutiny, because
they could have been influenced by "Jia Tan". One that
caught my eye comes immediately afterwards:
<a href="https://git.tukaani.org/?p=xz.git;a=commitdiff;h=e0c0ee475c0800c08291ae45e0d66aa00d5ce604">"prepares the code for alternative C versions and inline assembly"</a>
Multiple versions and assembly mean even more places to hide such a
security hole.</p>

<p>I stress that I have not found such a security hole, I'm only considering
what the worst case possibilities are. I think we need to fully consider
them in order to decide how to fully wrap up this mess.</p>

<p>Whether such stealthy security holes have been introduced into xz by "Jia
Tan" or not, there are definitely indications that the ssh backdoor was not
the end of what they had planned.</p>

<p>For one thing, the "test file" based system they introduced
<a href="https://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/30/15">was extensible</a>.
They could have been planning to add more test files later, that backdoored
xz in further ways.</p>

<p>And then there's the matter of the disabling of the Landlock sandbox. This
was not necessary for the ssh backdoor, because the sandbox is only used by
the <code>xz</code> command, not by liblzma. So why did they potentially tip their
hand by adding that rogue "." that disables the sandbox?</p>

<p>A sandbox would not prevent the kind of attack I discuss above, where xz is
just modifying code that it decompresses. Disabling the sandbox suggests
that they were going to make xz run arbitrary code, that perhaps wrote to
files it shouldn't be touching, to install a backdoor in the system.</p>

<p>Both deb and rpm use xz compression, and with the sandbox disabled,
whether they link with liblzma or run the <code>xz</code> command, a backdoored xz can
write to any file on the system while dpkg or rpm is running and noone is
likely to notice, because that's the kind of thing a package manager does.</p>

<p>My impression is that all of this was well planned and they were in it for
the long haul. They had no reason to stop with backdooring ssh, except for
the risk of additional exposure. But they decided to take that risk, with
the sandbox disabling. So they planned to do more, and every commit
by "Jia Tan", and really every commit that they could have influenced
needs to be distrusted.</p>

<p>This is why I've suggested to Debian that they
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/1068024">revert to an earlier version of xz</a>.
That would be my advice to anyone distributing xz.</p>

<p>I do have a <a href="https://git.joeyh.name/index.cgi/xz-unscathed/">xz-unscathed</a>
fork which I've carefully constructed to avoid all "Jia Tan" involved
commits. It feels good to not need to worry about <code>dpkg</code> and <code>tar</code>.
I only plan to maintain this fork minimally, eg security fixes.
Hopefully Lasse Collin will consider these possibilities and address
them in his response to the attack.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="The Rise and Fall of 3M’s Floppy Disk" data-elid="2667647674" data-post-url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/3m-floppy" data-authors="Ernie Smith" data-page-title="The Rise and Fall of 3M’s Floppy Disk - IEEE Spectrum"><p><em>A version of this post </em><a href="https://tedium.co/2023/11/17/3m-floppy-disks-history/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>originally appeared</em></a><em> on</em><a href="https://tedium.co/" target="_blank"><em>Tedium</em></a><em>, Ernie Smith’s newsletter, which hunts for the end of the long tail. </em></p><p>
	If you ask the average person what the company 3M does, odds are if they have a few gray hairs hanging out on their scalp, they might say that the company makes floppy disks. Now, this was once true, but 
	<a href="https://www.3m.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">if you look on 3M’s own website</a>, you will see no mention of this legacy—it’s a firm that sells abrasive materials, adhesive tapes, filters, films, personal protective equipment, and medical equipment. (Younger people, if they recognize 3M, it’s probably because of Post-it notes, or more recently its N95 masks)
</p><p>
	Floppies have had a surprisingly long life—in January 2024, 
	<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/floppy-disk-requirements-finally-axed-from-japan-government-regulations/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Japan announced</a> it will no longer require floppy-disk copies of government submissions. But 3M got out of the data-storage business about 28 years ago, when it transferred its floppy disk manufacturing to a spin-off called Imation. Imation is still around, under the name Glassbridge Enterprises, but with a much smaller profile.
</p><p><img alt="One yellow and one orange Imation 3M 3 \u00bd inch floppy diskettes on a gray background." data-rm-shortcode-id="09f8f834227ac15c2241ffede9966750" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/one-yellow-and-one-orange-imation-3m-3-u00bd-inch-floppy-diskettes-on-a-gray-background.jpg?id=51890455&amp;width=980" height="1250" id="d995a" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/one-yellow-and-one-orange-imation-3m-3-u00bd-inch-floppy-diskettes-on-a-gray-background.jpg?id=51890455&amp;width=980" width="2000"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">3M’s spin-off, Imation, continued producing floppy disks after 3M itself left the business. </small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit..."><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</a></small></p><p>
	Even with that said, those gray-hairs will frequently claim that of the many makers of floppies out there, 3M made the best ones. Given that, I was curious to figure out exactly why 3M became the most memorable brand in data storage during the formative days of computing, and why it abandoned the product.
</p><h2>How 3M Became a Key Innovator in the Production of Magnetic Data Storage</h2><p>
	Now, to be clear, 3M did not invent magnetic storage—that was done by Austro-German engineer 
	<a href="https://www.computerhistory.org/storageengine/audio-recorder-uses-low-cost-magnetic-tape/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fritz Pfleumer</a>, in 1928. He created audio tape, a recording medium that started as broad strips of paper coated with iron-powder granules, and eventually moved to less-fragile cellulose acetate with help from what would become another big name in floppy disks, BASF. At first, the innovation didn’t spread outside of Germany because of World War II.
</p><p>
	Nor was 3M the first company to popularize magnetic media—
	<a href="https://tedium.co/2022/08/26/tape-hiss-noise-history/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">that was Ampex</a>, which commercialized the tape recorder in the late 1940s. That was the point when magnetic tape turned into a major innovation in the world of music—one that, famously, <a href="https://ethw.org/First-Hand:Bing_Crosby_and_the_Recording_Revolution" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bing Crosby got to first</a> because he gave financial support to Ampex. Incidentally, Ampex’s later spinoff, Memorex, represented <a href="https://tedium.co/2021/09/03/memorex-tape-history/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Silicon Valley’s first true startup</a>.
</p><blockquote>“Of all the businesses 3M has shed over its 100 years, the two seminal decisions that people point to as most significant involved the sale of 3M’s Duplicating Products business to Harris Corporation in Atlanta, Georgia, and the spin-off of 3M’s data-storage and imaging-systems businesses in 1996 creating a new company called Imation in Oakdale, Minnesota...”</blockquote><p>
	Before World War II, one company did attempt to manufacture a tape recorder in the U.S. based on Pfluemer’s magnetic-tape invention. That firm, the Brush Development Co., 
	<a href="https://www.radiomuseum.org/dsp_hersteller_detail.cfm?company_id=2092" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">had developed a device called the Soundmirror</a>, produced by a Hungarian inventor named Semi J. Begun, who was likely something of a competitor to Pfleumer: Also a German, he had moved to the United States and developed a steel-based magnetic tape. The invention was used by the U.S. military during the war, and the company revisited the idea immediately after. But, it needed someone to manufacture magnetic tape for it to use.
</p><p>
	As author David Morton noted in his 2006 book 
	<em>Sound Recording: The Life Story of a Technology</em>, <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Sound_Recording/0ZmjkJwxyWcC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;pg=PA121&amp;printsec=frontcover" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">3M was one of the best-suited companies on the market</a> to help Brush out. That’s because the groundbreaking work that the company had done to develop pressure-sensitive adhesive tape was an essential element of making magnetic tape effective.
</p><p><img alt="Black and white historical photo of a man in worker overall and a cap applying newspaper and tape to an old car." data-rm-shortcode-id="7b3354061aa56d651ce26122330f6db6" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-historical-photo-of-a-man-in-worker-overall-and-a-cap-applying-newspaper-and-tape-to-an-old-car.jpg?id=51890488&amp;width=980" height="930" id="8f6d5" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/black-and-white-historical-photo-of-a-man-in-worker-overall-and-a-cap-applying-newspaper-and-tape-to-an-old-car.jpg?id=51890488&amp;width=980" width="1240"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">3M’s adhesive-tape technology transferred readily to magnetic tape. </small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">3M</small></p><p>
	Strangely enough, Richard Gurley Drew, the inventor of much of 3M’s tape technology, was a musician—he played banjo in a local orchestra—when he took a job with the company. He probably didn’t realize he was inventing a key element of 20th-century recording technology when he observed that auto body shops needed a way to “mask off” areas of vehicles that were being whittled down with sandpaper, but his observation would prove useful to the invention of masking tape.

You might know his invention, developed in 1925, as Scotch Tape.
</p><p>
	In 1930, he followed it up with another invention that was even more amazing—tape made from cellophane, which by its nature was totally transparent. Another 3M employee developed the tape dispenser, and the two inventions reshaped offices the world over.
</p><p>
	So, when Brush looked to others to produce its recording medium, 3M was well positioned to help out due to magnetic tape’s similarity with its Scotch Tape. Brush eventually moved to other manufacturers, like Dupont. But the experience led 3M to continue developing metal-oxide tape technology, leading to the creation of the Scotch 111 reel-to-reel tape, which was one of the most popular types used in recording studios throughout the 1950s, according to the 
	<a href="https://museumofmagneticsoundrecording.org/Manufacturers3M.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Museum of Magnetic Sound Recording</em></a>.
</p><p>
	I admittedly have long had a fascination with these reel-to-reel tapes. A number of years ago, back when I lived in Milwaukee, I found a couple of blank reel-to-reel tapes created by 3M using the Scotch name. I bought them from a junk store, and maybe paid $2 for them. They managed to follow me through three states and five cities, and now sit on 
	<a href="https://midrange.tedium.co/issues/bless-this-mess/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">my intentionally organized pile of junk</a>. Based on my analysis of the container and the logotype it uses, they date to the mid-1960s or earlier. (No, I have not tried to record on them.)

	For years, 3M’s reel-to-reels had one of the strongest reputations in the music industry; they were built to be of superhigh quality. But you might be wondering, how did 3M make the leap from reel-to-reel tape to floppies? It feels like just as strange a leap as a masking tape company developing reel-to-reel audio tape.
	<br></p><p>
	But, again, it happened.
</p><h3>How 3M’s Tapes Went From Music to Data</h3><p>
	3M didn’t develop the floppy disk drive, either. 
	<a href="https://tedium.co/2023/07/22/alan-shugart-floppy-disk-history/" target="_blank">IBM did, and Shugart Associates further improved it</a> by making it small enough for regular users.
</p><p><img alt="One 3M 5 \u00bc\u201d Floppy disk in a sleeve stands against a gray background." data-rm-shortcode-id="43b65ca8e6f0dca5e3362d6bde5ec2b0" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/one-3m-5-u00bc-u201d-floppy-disk-in-a-sleeve-stands-against-a-gray-background.jpg?id=51890553&amp;width=980" height="1250" id="f22da" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/one-3m-5-u00bc-u201d-floppy-disk-in-a-sleeve-stands-against-a-gray-background.jpg?id=51890553&amp;width=980" width="2000"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">3M manufactured a signature 5.25-inch floppy disk. </small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">IEEE Spectrum</small></p><p>
	But 3M, much as with mechanical tape, was well positioned to improve on it, leveraging its skills with mechanical media in the budding computing industry. In a way, 3M came to media manufacturing from the opposite direction than its disk-selling competitor Memorex did. Memorex started with computers and gradually came to develop and improve tape-based technology, which eventually evolved into floppy disks. On the other hand, 3M started with the raw materials and the manufacturing processes, and combined those into computing’s greatest commodity item, the floppy disk.
</p><p>
	3M got into the floppy disk market around the 
	<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=pWBoOXVjuZ0C&amp;pg=PT10#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fall of 1973</a>. It was not the only manufacturer of disks out there—some names from this era include Verbatim, Control Data, Dysan, and BASF. Most of these companies started with computing technology—for example, Dysan worked closely with Shugart Associates on the 5.25-inch floppy. But 3M wasn’t alone in starting with the raw materials. BASF, a German chemical manufacturer, has a somewhat similar corporate history and logo design to fellow thick-Helvetica enthusiast 3M. (Though 3M obviously <a href="https://www.basf.com/global/en/who-we-are/history/chronology/1925-1944/1939-1945.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">never associated with the Nazis</a> during World War II, so there’s that.)

	3M didn’t rest on its laurels with the floppy disk either, and tried to push the technology further, most notably with 
	<a href="https://www.storagenewsletter.com/2018/09/25/history-1991-floptical-by-insite-peripherals/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Floptical disk technology</a>, which Jim Adkisson, who helped create the 5.25-inch floppy at Shugart Associates, developed in the 1980s. A partnership of 3M, Maxell, and <a href="https://tedium.co/2016/12/06/iomega-zip-disk-click-of-death-history/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Iomega</a> created the Floptical disk, which could hold 20 megabytes of data on something that looked a lot like a 3.5-inch floppy. Unfortunately the floptical disk flopped, losing out to products like Iomega’s iconic <a href="https://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/22978/Iomega-Zip-Drive-100-Parallel/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Zip drives</a>.
</p><p>
	3M also worked in more specialized media, developing high-capacity optical disks that fit into standard floppy and optical disk mechanisms, as well as high-end tape drives intended for the server room rather than your cassette player.
</p><p>
	In many ways, 3M was out front on one of the most important elements of computing and was making huge profits from it. But by the end of 1995, those days were done. What changed?
</p><p><span data-rm-shortcode-id="7620f5c6d1db2474feabc8fb1ec83bbc"><iframe frameborder="0" height="auto" type="lazy-iframe" scrolling="no" data-runner-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bOHKgENMcGQ?rel=0" width="100%"></iframe></span><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">3M advertised its floppy disk as more reliable than the competition in no uncertain terms. </small></p><h3>What Led 3M to Kick a Multibillion-Dollar Business to the Curb</h3><p>
	By 1995, 3M’s magnetic-media arm had evolved into a US $2.3 billion business, according to
	<a href="https://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,985024-1,00.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Time</em></a>, which made it a significant chunk of 3M’s overall offering.
</p><p>
	But at that time, high technology—
	<em>especially</em> consumer technology—was starting to look like a bad bet for legacy companies. This was around the same period that AT&amp;T, still smarting from misadventures like the <a href="https://www.inverse.com/input/features/fax-on-the-beach-the-story-of-atts-eo-communicator-90s-ipad-flop" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">EO Personal Communicator</a>, spun off Bell Labs as Lucent Technologies.
</p><p>
	3M’s story, in its own words, suggests a similar crisis of culture. In 
	<a href="https://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/171240O/3m-century-of-innovation-book.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>A Century of Innovation</em></a>, a book published by the company in 2002, around the time of its 100-year anniversary, the company compared the creation of the spin-off, which it called “the most wrenching decision in its history,” to that of its determination eight years earlier to sell its Duplicating Products Division, which sold copying machines:
</p><p><em>Of all the businesses 3M has shed over its 100 years, the two seminal decisions that people point to as most significant involved the sale of 3M’s Duplicating Products business to Harris Corporation in Atlanta, Georgia, and the spin-off of 3M’s data-storage and imaging-systems businesses in 1996 creating a new company called Imation in Oakdale, Minnesota, near 3M headquarters. The two decisions have several elements in common—both involved businesses that 3M created and, in fact, ranked number one in the marketplace for decades. They were “homegrown” businesses—largely created within 3M and commercialized and built with the energy of many internal sponsors and champions. The businesses were risky because the products were based on pioneering technologies. They not only changed the basis of competition; they also created all new, global industries. The businesses were highly profitable for decades, and they represented a significant share of the company’s total annual revenues. They also produced many of 3M’s next generation of leaders.</em></p><p>
	So what happened? Essentially, despite the company’s success working in industrial and professional settings, doing things for consumers like producing videotapes, floppy disks, and cassettes meant moving out of its comfort zone. These products, initially developed for businesses, grew so popular that they suddenly needed to be available at every big-box store and drugstore alike, and, Post-its aside, retail was not a fit for the kind of company 3M was.
</p><p>
	But more significantly, other companies were simply better at undercutting, and per the corporate biography, that required some tough decisions to be made:
</p><p><em>While it sold its products for little or no profit, its competition sold their products for even less. Even though the consumer business had huge growth potential, 3M had little experience with a low-cost, low-profit-margin model.</em></p><p><em> The markings were clear—exit this business, even though 3M invented it. To stay in the “dog fight” meant 3M had to invest enormous amounts of money in order to remain the low-cost producer, with no assurance that profit margins ever would improve. “Exiting it was the right decision,” [former senior vice president Al] Huber said.</em></p><p>
	Seeing what came after, it’s hard to disagree. While floppies were still a significant medium in the mid-1990s, it was obvious that they would not be enough capacity for the next generation of data hoarders. It would only be a couple of years before Apple would put the first dagger in the heart of the floppy disk with 
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMac_G3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the iMac</a>, breaking with tradition by releasing a personal computer in 1998 with no built-in floppy disk drive.
</p><p><span data-rm-shortcode-id="5b53a6e7ab0f74ffc4d7a5fed5a851a5"><iframe frameborder="0" height="auto" type="lazy-iframe" scrolling="no" data-runner-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3qkQi3zZVhg?rel=0" width="100%"></iframe></span><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">Imation carried on a floppy-disk ad campaign through the late 1990s. </small></p><p>
	That was a harbinger of what was to come. Within a decade of the decision, floppy drives, compact cassettes, and videotapes—the three key elements of 3M’s move into consumer-driven magnetic media—had fallen by the wayside. Imation, still active today, is owned by O-Jin Corp., a Korean technology company 
	<a href="http://www.imation.com/board/bbs/board.php?bo_table=news_en&amp;wr_id=11" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">that basically bought it for its trademarked name</a>.</p><p>Much like its one-time competitor Memorex, Imation is a technology ghost kitchen. Its former corporate parent 3M, meanwhile, has a market cap of $51.33 billion at the time of this writing.</p><h3>3M’s Magnetic Legacy</h3><p>
	In a lot of ways, I think 3M’s persisting deep association with computing, despite the fact that the company left the field decades ago, comes down to the fact that it had a very recognizable logo design during its computer heyday.</p><p><span></span>My first experience with 3M was seeing its bright red logo on floppy disks used in classrooms with Apple IIe computers in the late 1980s and early ’90s. 3M was instantly recognizable among those responsible for creating the disks we needed to load up <em>Number Munchers</em> and <em>Commander Keen</em>, and as a result, its name is forever imprinted into the brains of retro-tech nerds the world over. It is a memory that gives me warm feelings.
</p><p>
	But 3M, for a number of reasons, is not a company that carries a lot of goodwill with younger generations. For example, the company is closely associated with the manufacturing of a variety of chemicals, including PFOS (Perfluorooctane sulfonate), a key ingredient in Scotchguard and other water-resistant materials. It’s one of many PFAS (perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl) substances that are believed to be harmful to humans.
</p><p>
	The floppy disks that I and other elder millennials associate with a company that was essential to our youthful computing experience are long gone, shuttled away as a non-core business for a giant corporation that is best described as an amalgamation of non-core businesses loosely held together by a logo and backing in chemistry and raw materials.

<h2>
<span>I </span><span id="S1.1.1">Introduction</span>
</h2>

<p id="S1.p1.1">As someone who does Artificial Intelligence (AI) research in a university, you develop a complicated relationship to the corporate AI research powerhouses, such as Googe DeepMind, OpenAI, and Meta AI. Whenever you see one of these papers that train some kind of gigantic neural net model to do something you were not even sure a neural network could do, unquestionably pushing the state of the art and reconfiguring your ideas of what is possible, you get conflicting emotions. On the one hand: it is very impressive. Good on you for pushing AI forward. On the other hand: how could we possibly keep up? As an AI academic, leading a lab with a few PhD students and (if you’re lucky) some postdoctoral fellows, perhaps with a few dozen Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) in your lab, this kind of research is simply not possible to do.</p>
<p id="S1.p2.1">To be clear, this was not always the case. As recently as ten years ago, if you had a decent desktop computer and an internet connection you had everything you needed to compete with the best of researchers out there. Ground-breaking papers were often written by one or two people who ran all the experiments on their regular workstations. It is useful to point this out particularly for those who have come into the research field within the last decade, and for which the need for gigantic compute resources is a given.</p>
<p id="S1.p3.1">If we have learned one thing from deep learning <cite>[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="">9</a>]</cite>, it is that scaling works. From the ImageNet&nbsp;<cite>[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="">19</a>]</cite> competitions and their various winners to ChatGPT, Gato&nbsp;<cite>[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="">17</a>]</cite>, and most recently to GPT-4&nbsp;<cite>[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="">1</a>]</cite>, we have seen that more data and more compute yield quantitatively and often even qualitatively better results. (By the time you are reading this, that list of very recent AI milestones might very well be outdated.). Of course there are improvements to learning algorithms and network architectures as well, but these improvements are mostly useful in the context of the massive scale of experiments. (Sutton talks about the “Bitter Pill”, referring to the insight that simple methods that scale well always win the day when more compute becomes available&nbsp;<cite>[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="">22</a>]</cite>.) A scale that is not achievable by academic researchers nowadays. As far as we can tell, the gap between the amount of compute available to ordinary researchers and the amount available to stay competitive is growing every year.</p>
<p id="S1.p4.1">This goes a long way to explain the resentment that many AI researchers in academia feel towards these companies. Healthy competition from your peers is one thing, but competition from someone that has so much resources that they can easily do things you could never do, no matter how good your ideas are, is another thing. When you have been working on a research topic for a while and, say, DeepMind or OpenAI decides to work on the same thing, you will likely feel the same way as the owner of a small-town general store feels when Walmart sets up shop next door. Which is sad, because we want to believe in research as an open and collaborative endeavor where everybody gets their contribution recognized, don’t we?</p>
<p id="S1.p5.1">So, if you are but a Professor, with a limited team size and limited compute resources, what can you do to stay relevant in face of the onslaught of incredibly well-funded research companies? This is a question that has been troubling us and many of our colleagues for years now. Recent events, with models such as GPT-4 being shockingly capable and shockingly closed-sourced and devoid of published details, has made the question even more urgent. We have heard from multiple researchers at various levels of seniority, both in-person and via social media, who worry about the prospects of doing meaningful research given the lack of resources and the unfair competition from big tech companies.</p>
<p id="S1.p6.1">Let us make this clear at the outset: both of us are secure. We hold tenured academic Professorships and we rose up on the academic ladder pretty fast, in part because of finding an academic niche: we systematically pushed the envelope of AI in the domain of video games. While we obviously care about continuing to do relevant AI research ourselves, we are writing this mostly for our more junior colleagues, postdocs and doctoral students, who may wonder about which career path to choose. Is it worthwhile to go into academia, or is it better to join a big tech company, or maybe kick off a startup? Is a career in AI a good idea, or is it better to become a plumber? Should you be a cog in the machinery, or a rebel? (It’s usually easier to be a rebel when you have nothing to lose, which is either at the beginning of your career or when you have tenure.) As skilled as one may be, is this glorious battle to stay competitive lost already? Are we about to lie here, obedient to our laws? This Point of View article is partly meant as serious advice, and partly as emotional encouragement, but perhaps most of all to start a discussion with all of you so we improve our position as academics before the battle is long lost. We do not wish to stop the evolution of AI technology (even if we could); quite the contrary: we wish to discuss the strategies that will equip as many as possible to be part of this journey. While the challenges are real and many, we both feel the are even more opportunities and the time is right to grab them!</p>
<p id="S1.p7.1">In the remainder of this article we list a number of ideas (or strategies) for what to do if you are an AI academic despairing about your options. These options are presented in no particular order. We also don’t make any particular recommendations here or ranking the options for you. It is up to you to pick one, more than one, or none of them as your favourite direction. Towards the end of the article, however, we discuss what big tech companies and universities can do to help the situation. There, we make some specific suggestions.</p>

<h2>
<span>II </span><span id="S2.1.1">Give Up!</span>
</h2>

<p id="S2.p1.1">Giving up is always an option. Not giving up on doing research, but giving up on doing things that are really impactful and pushing the envelope. There are still plenty of technical details and sub-sub-questions to publish papers about in mid-tier journals and conferences. Please note, however: (1) This works best if you already have a secure permanent position and you do not care much about promotions, (2) this wasn’t really what you dreamed of doing when you decided on a research career, right? Forcing yourself to reframe your research agenda because of this fierce competition is similar to adjusting your research to the priorities of funding bodies like the European Commission or US National Science Foundation. At least going for the latter might secure some funding for your lab which can, in turn, help you work with some talented AI researchers and doctoral students. It is important to note that we both consider ourselves lucky enough as we have coordinated or have been part of several small- and large-scale research projects<span id="footnote1"><sup>1</sup><span><span><sup>1</sup><span>1</span>Examples include the H2020 AI4Media (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.ai4media.eu/" title="">https://www.ai4media.eu/</a>) and the FP7 C2Learn (<a target="_blank" href="http://project.c2learn.eu/" title="">http://project.c2learn.eu/</a>) projects.</span></span></span> that allowed us to support our research agendas and helped us (in part) to secure our positions.</p>
</section>
<section id="S3">
<h2>
<span>III </span><span id="S3.1.1">Try Scaling Anyway</span>
</h2>

<p id="S3.p1.1">Going head-to-head with an overwhelming competition is an admirable sentiment. If scaling works, let’s do it in our university labs! Let’s go tilting at windmills (GPU fans)!</p>
<p id="S3.p2.1">The most obvious problem is access to central processing units (CPUs) and GPUs. So, let’s say you secure $50k of funding for cloud compute from somewhere and go ahead running your big experiment. But this is a very small amount of money compared to what training something like GPT-3 costs. The recent open AI agent that learned to craft a diamond pickaxe in Minecraft required training of 9 days on 720 V100 GPUs&nbsp;<cite>[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="">2</a>]</cite>; this amounts to a few hundred thousand dollars for a single experiment. Not even prestigious European Research Council (EU) or National Science Foundation (US) grants can support such a level of investment. Still, spending $50k on cloud compute will give you significantly more compute than a bunch of gaming PCs taped together, so you could scale at least a little bit. At least for that very experiment. But as we all know, most experiments don’t work the first time you try them. For every big successful experiment we see reported, we have unreported months or maybe years of prototypes, proofs of concept, debugging, parameter tuning, and failed starts. You need this level of compute available constantly.</p>
<p id="S3.p3.1">The less obvious problem is that you need the right kind of team to build experimental software that scales, and that is generally not compatible with academic career structures. Most of the members of a typical academic research lab in computer science are PhD students that need to graduate within a few years, and need to have an individual project to work on which results in multiple first-author papers so they can get a job afterwards. A large-scale AI project typically means that most members of the team work for many months or years on the same project, where only one of them can be the first author on the paper. The team will probably also include people who do “mundane” software engineering tasks that are crucial to the success of the project, but which are not seen as AI research in themselves. The structures needed for successful large scale projects are simply not compatible with the structures of academia.</p>
</section>
<section id="S4">
<h2>
<span>IV </span><span id="S4.1.1">Scale Down</span>
</h2>

<p id="S4.p1.1">One popular way to bypass the issue is to focus on simple yet representative (toy) problems that will either prove the benefits of a new approach theoretically or showcase the comparative advantages of a novel method. Indicatively, a recent paper on Behaviour Transformers <cite>[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="">21</a>]</cite> showcased the benefits of the method on a toy navigation task that only took a simple multi layer perceptron to solve. A similar approach was later used in <cite>[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="">15</a>]</cite>. Both studies will likely be impactful despite the limited scale because they demonstrated the capacity of the algorithms in popular game and robotic benchmark problems that require large models and significant compute to train. In <cite>[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="">14</a>]</cite> we observe the same pattern once again: a case is made in a toy (gambling) environment but the impact, one would argue, comes from the comparative advantages the algorithm shows in more complex but computationally heavy problems.</p>
<p id="S4.p2.1">A downside with this approach is that people are wowed by pretty colors in high resolution, and take a real car navigating a road more seriously than a toy car, even though the challenges may be the same. So you will get less media exposure, perhaps less funding. There are also domains, such as language, which are very hard to scale down beyond some limit.</p>
</section>
<section id="S5">
<h2>
<span>V </span><span id="S5.1.1">Reuse and Remaster</span>
</h2>

<p id="S5.p1.1">A key reason that AI has advanced so rapidly over the last decade is that researchers make their code and models available to the scientific community. Model sharing and code accessibility was neither the norm nor the priority of AI researchers back in the days. Having access to pretrained large models like ViT in vision <cite>[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="">4</a>]</cite> or the Llama family for text&nbsp;<cite>[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="">25</a>]</cite> saves you time and effort as you can simply resue them, and fine-tune them for your own specific problem. Arguably, one needs to assume that the representations of those large models is general enough to be able to perform well to your downstream task with limited training. Unfortunately the fine-tuning and post-hoc analysis of a large model is sometimes not enough for good performance, especially if your domain is quite different from what they were pre-trained for. Relying on pre-trained models is therefore limiting the scope of research you can do.</p>
</section>
<section id="S6">
<h2>
<span>VI </span><span id="S6.1.1">Analysis Instead of Synthesis</span>
</h2>

<p id="S6.p1.1">Another thing one can do with the publicly available pretrained models is to analyze them. While this may not directly contribute to new capabilities, it can still make scientific progress. The current state of things is that we have great models for text and image generation publicly available, but we don’t understand them very well. You could even argue that we barely understand them all. Let’s face it: a transformer is not an intuitive thing to anyone, and the scale of data these models are trained on is almost incomprehensible in itself. There is plenty of work to do in analyzing them, for example by probing them in creative ways, and developing visualizations and conceptual machinery to help us understand them.</p>
<p id="S6.p2.1">One can do analysis with different mindsets. Trying to find and describe specific circuits and mechanisms that have been learnt is useful, and can help us (well, someone else, with resources) to create better models in the future. But one can also play the role of the gadfly, incessantly finding ways to break them! This is scientifically and societally valuable, no matter what those who try to make a business out of large models say. But it might not be the kind of research you want to do.</p>
</section>
<section id="S7">
<h2>
<span>VII </span><span id="S7.1.1">RL! No Data!</span>
</h2>

<p id="S7.p1.1">One might scale down one’s requirements with respect to data and instead approach AI problems through the lens of (online) reinforcement learning (RL). Following the RL path might allow you to bypass issues related to data availability, analysis, storage and handling; it does not however minimize the computational effort required necessarily. In fact, even the most efficient RL methods are known to be computationally heavy as the very process of exploration is costly. Moreover, shaping a reward function often involves forms of black art (informally) or practical wisdom (more formally). That is, a researcher often needs to continuously run lengthy experiments with different types of reward (among other hyperparameters) for a breakthrough result. So ultimately one has to downscale the complexity of the problem once again. The bottom line is that if you want to break free from large data sets you might be still faced with large compute requirements unless you work on simple (toy) problems, specialized domains, or work with small models; the next section is dedicated to the latter strategy.</p>
</section>
<section id="S8">
<h2>
<span>VIII </span><span id="S8.1.1">Small Models! No Compute!</span>
</h2>

<p id="S8.p1.1">Another valid strategy is to compromise on model scale to save on compute. There are many circumstances where you want or need a smaller model. Think of the smallest possible models that are capable of solving a problem or completing a task. This is particularly important to and relevant for real-world applications. <em id="S8.p1.1.1">In-the-wild</em> domains such as games, internet of things, and autonomous vehicles could allow AI to be deployed next to their end user and the data the user generates, i.e. at the edge of the network. This is often called <em id="S8.p1.1.2">edge AI</em> <cite>[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="">10</a>]</cite>, the operation of AI applications in devices of the physical world is possible when memory requirements are low and inference occurs rapidly. Neuroevolution and neural architecture search <cite>[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="">10</a>]</cite>, and knowledge distillation <cite>[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="">13</a>]</cite> methods are only a few of the available methods for edge AI. Note that beyond learning more from smaller models one could also attempt to learn more from less data <cite>[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="">7</a>]</cite>.
Following this research path may lead to significant into models’ inner workings. Studying small AI models makes the analysis far easier and increases the explainability of whatever the model does. Moreover, deploying such models on devices helps with privacy concerns. You can also argue for small models from the perspective of <em id="S8.p1.1.3">green AI</em>&nbsp;<cite>[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="">20</a>]</cite>&nbsp;, as it minimizes the environmental footprint of the research. Obviously there are limits to what a small model is capable of doing but the importance of this research direction, we feel, will be growing drastically over the years.</p>

<section id="S9">
<h2>
<span>IX </span><span id="S9.1.1">Work on Specialized Application Areas or Domains</span>
</h2>

<p id="S9.p1.1">One rather efficient strategy is to pick a niche but somewhat established area of research––that is likely beyond the immediate interest of the industry—and try to innovate within and through that area. It is often a successful strategy to bring and test your ideas to an entirely new domain but it is less often that the outcomes will have a large impact beyond that domain. There are plenty of examples of niche areas eventually becoming dominant due to the push of a few dedicated researchers. We are both currently mostly taking this strategy: we have the AI for games community as primary scientific community where we can perform state-of-art work, as few large companies put serious efforts into modern AI for games.</p>
<p id="S9.p2.1">Think of video games as a domain that penetrated the research communities of robotics and computer vision back in early 00s, and again with video games as deep RL benchmarks after 2015. Think of neural networks and deep learning methods that came to dominate communities invested in support vector machines and regression models (e.g. NeurIPS a decade ago). Also think of the ways reinforcement learning and deep learning have altered the core principles of multi-agent learning and cognitive/affect modeling in communities represented by the AAMAS, ACII and IVA conferences, for instance.</p>
<p id="S9.p3.1">A core downside to this strategy is the difficulty getting your paper accepted in the kind of large venues that are most influential in AI, such as NeurIPS, AAAI, ICML and IJCAI. Your paper and its results might end up sitting out-of-the-interest-distribution. It is, however, very possible to start your own community with its own publication venues.</p>
<p id="S9.p4.1">If you do not have the requisite domain expertise—and/or datasets—yourself, you can fruitfully approach domain experts to collaborate. The good news is that as an academic, you have plenty of such experts in other departments of your university or institute and they all have interesting AI problems to solve if you spend some time talking to them. One of the authors recently ran in to an anthropologist and an analytical chemist in a corridor, and started discussing projects that would include all three. Another example is a recent collaboration of one of the authors with urban designers resulting in the reconstruction of urban areas around MIT and Harvard for improving the comfort levels of Bostonians <cite>[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="">5</a>]</cite>.</p>
<p id="S9.p5.1">These projects may not end up advancing the state of AI much, but may make big differences in the particular disciplines. And sometimes big AI advances come from application-specific work.</p>

<span>X </span><span id="S10.1.1">Solve Problems Few Care About (For Now!)</span>
</h2>

<p id="S10.p1.1">While focusing on an established niche or application field is a relatively safe strategy, a somewhat riskier one is to find a niche or application that does not exist yet. Basically, focus on a problem that almost no-one sees the importance of, or a method that nobody finds promising.</p>
<p id="S10.p2.1">One approach is to go looking for applications that people have not seriously applied AI to. A good idea is to look into a field that is neither timely nor “sexy”. The bet here is that this particular application domain will become important in the future, either in its own right or because it enables something else. We both took this path. Procedural content generation for games was a very niche topic 15 years ago and we helped nuild a research community around it<cite>[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="">28</a>]</cite>; recently it has become more important not only for the games industry, but also as a way to help generalize (deep) reinforcement learning <cite>[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="">23</a>]</cite>. Research on reinforcement learning is a core AI topic with thousands of papers published per year, lending more importance to this once somewhat obscure topic. This high-risk high-gain mindset might lead to a lonely path that nevertheless could end up being highly rewarding in the long run.</p>
<p id="S10.p3.1">So, look around you, and talk to people who are not AI researchers. What problem domains do you see where AI is rarely applied, and which AI researchers seem to not know or care about? Might someone care about these domains in the future? If so, you may want to dig deeper in one of those domains.</p>

<span>XI </span><span id="S11.1.1">Try Things that Shouldn’t Work</span>
</h2>

<p id="S11.p1.1">Another comparative advantage of small academic teams is the ability to try things that “shouldn’t work”, in the sense that they are unsupported by theory or experimental evidence. The dynamics of large industry research labs are typically such that researchers are incentivized to try things that are likely to work; if not, money is lost. In academia, failure can be as instructive and valuable as success and the stakes are lower overall. Many important inventions and ideas in AI come from trying the “wrong” thing. In particular, all of deep learning stems from researchers stubbornly working on neural networks even though there were good theoretical reasons why they shouldn’t work.</p>
</section>
<section id="S12">
<h2>
<span>XII </span><span id="S12.1.1">Do Things that Have Bad Optics</span>
</h2>

<p id="S12.p1.1">The larger and more important a company is, the more constrained it is by ethics and optics. Any company is ultimately responsible to their shareholders, and if the shareholders perceive that the company suffers “reputational damage” they can easily fire the CEO. So large companies will try to avoid to do anything that looks bad. To get around this, large companies sometimes fund startups to do their more experimental work that might go wrong (think Microsoft and OpenAI). But even such plays have limits, as bad PR can come washing back like the tide in San Francisco Bay.</p>
<p id="S12.p2.1">As an individual researcher, who either has no position or who already has a secure position, you have nothing to lose. You can do things that are as crazy as you like. You are only constrained by the law and your own personality. Now, we are in no way arguing that you should do research that is unethical. By all means, try to do the right thing. But what you find objectionable might be very different from what a group of mostly-white liberal overeducated engineers in coastal USA find objectionable. The PR departments, ethics committees, and boards of directors of the rich tech companies espouse a very particular set of values. But the world is large, and full of very different people and cultures. So there is a big opportunity to do research that these tech companies will not do even though they could.</p>
<p id="S12.p3.1">As an example of a project that exploits such an opportunity, one of us participated in a project critically examining the normativity of the “neutral English” in current writing support systems by creating an autocomplete system with a language model that assumes you write in the tone of Chuck Tingle, the famous author of absurd sci-fi political satire gay erotica&nbsp;<cite>[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="">8</a>]</cite>. Our guess is that this project would not have been cleared for publication by Amazon or Google. Another example is this very paper.</p>
<p id="S12.p4.1">Similarly, you may find that you deviate from the cultural consensus in big tech companies regarding topics relating to nudity, sexuality, rudeness, religion, capitalism, communism, law and order, justice, equality, welfare, representation, history, reproduction, violence, or something else. As all AI research happens in and is influenced by a cultural and political context, see your deviation from the norm as an opportunity. If you can’t do the research they couldn’t do, do the research they wouldn’t do.</p>

<h2>
<span>XIII </span><span id="S13.1.1">Start it Up; Spin it Out!</span>
</h2>

<p id="S13.p1.1">By now it should be rather clear that academia is somewhat, paradoxically, limiting academic AI research. Even if one manages to secure large-scale multimillion projects this covers only a fraction of human and computational resources that are necessary for contemporary AI research, and the career structures and IP rights regimes of universities often impose further limits. One popular alternative among AI scientists is to spin out their idea from their university lab and found a company that will gradually transfer AI research to a set of commercial-standard services or products. Both authors have been part of this journey through co-founding modl.ai <cite>[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="">16</a>]</cite> and have learned a lot from this.</p>
<p id="S13.p2.1">Being part of the applied AI world offers many benefits. In principle you get access to rich data from real-world applications that you wouldn’t be able to have otherwise. Moreover your AI algorithms are tested on challenging commercial-standard, applications and have to be operational in the wild. Finally, you usually gain access to more compute and, if the start-up scales up, growing access to human resources.</p>
<p id="S13.p3.1">This journey is far from straightforward, however, as there are several limiting factors to consider. First, not all research ideas are directly applicable to a startup business model. Your best research ideas might be brilliant in terms of understanding the world, or at least getting published in highly prestigious venues, but that does not mean that one can easily make products out of them. Second, many outstanding results one obtained in the lab today may have to go through a long runway until they turn into a business case of some sort. Most startups do development rather than research, as the runways are short and you need to have a functioning product, preferably with some market traction, before the next funding round in two years or so. Third, even if you do get some investment, this does not mean you have an unlimited compute budget. With seed grants often in the range of a few millions, this does not buy you the capacity to do OpenAI-level experiments, especially as you need to pay real salaries (not PhD stipends) to your employees. Fourth, not every AI academic enjoys this type of an adventure. At the end of the day most academics have long agreed on their priorities when they opted to follow the academic career path. You don’t become a professor for the money. The security of an academic environment (given that it is both safe and creative), means to some far more than any potentially higher salary or other corporate benefits.</p>
<p id="S13.p4.1">Here, we might point out that both of us publish many more papers with our academic research teams than with the company we co-founded and work part-time at. On the other hand, we believe we have more direct impact on the games industry through our company.</p>

<h2>
<span>XIV </span><span id="S14.1.1">Collaborate, or Jump Ship!</span>
</h2>

<p id="S14.p1.1">If none of the above options work for you and you still want to innovate though large scale methods that are trained on lots of data you can always collaborate with those that have them both: compute and data. There are several ways to move forward with this approach.</p>
<p id="S14.p2.1">Universities in the vicinity of leading AI companies have a comparative advantage as local social networks and in-person meetings make the collaboration easier. Researchers from remote universities can still establish collaborations though research visits, placements and internships as part of a joint-research project. More radically, some established AI professors decide to dedicate some (if not all) of their research time to an industrial partner or even move their entire lab in there. Results from such partnerships, placements or lab transfers can be astonishing <cite>[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="">27</a>]</cite>. At a glance, this looks like the best way forward for AI academics, however, 1) the generated IP cannot always be published and 2) not everyone can or want to work in an industry-based AI lab.</p>
<p id="S14.p3.1">One might even argue that innovation should be driven by public institutions as supported by the industry, not the other way around. It is arguably the university’s responsibility to maintain (part of, or some of) the talented AI researchers it educates (academics and students) and the IP they generate. Otherwise AI education and research will eventually become redundant within a University environment. This would be bad for everyone, as knowledge would be less open, and there would be no-one to train the next generation of AI researchers. Next, let’s look at this relationship more closely and outline ways industrial corporations and universities may be able to help.</p>
</section>
<section id="S15">
<h2>
<span>XV </span><span id="S15.1.1">How Can Large Players in Industry Help?</span>
</h2>

<p id="S15.p1.1">It is not clear that large companies with well-financed AI labs actually want to help alleviate this situation. Individual researchers and managers might care about the depression of academic AI research, but what the companies care about is the bottom line and shareholder value, and having a competitive academic research community might or might not be in their best interest. However, to the extent that large private sector actors do care, there are multiple things they can do.</p>
<p id="S15.p2.1">At the most basic level, open-sourcing models, including both weights and training scripts, helps a lot. It allows academic AI researchers to study the trained models, fine-tune them, and build systems around them. It still leaves academic researchers uncompetitive when it comes to training new models, but it is a start. To their credit, several large industrial research organizations regularly release their most capable models publicly; Meta in particular stands out. Others don’t, and could rightly be shamed for not doing so. In particular if their name implies some degree of openness.</p>
<p id="S15.p3.1">The next step for remedying this situation is to collaborate with academia. As discussed earlier (see Section <a href="#S14" title="XIV Collaborate, or Jump Ship! ‣ Choose Your Weapon: Survival Strategies for Depressed AI Academics"><span>XIV</span></a>) some large institutions regularly do this, mostly through accepting current PhD students as interns, allowing these students to do large-scale work. Some offer joint appointments to certain academic researchers, and a few even occasionally offer research grants. All of this is good, but more can be done. In particular there could be mechanisms where academics initiate collaborations by proposing work they would do collaboratively, and there could be more stable research funding mechanisms.</p>
<p id="S15.p4.1">Going even further, private companies that really wanted to help mend this academia-industry divide could choose to work in public: post their plans, commit code, models, and development updates to public repositories and allowing academics to contribute freely. This is not how most companies work, and often they have good reasons for their secrecy. On the other hand, a lot could be gained from having academics contributing to your code and training for free.</p>
</section>
<section id="S16">
<h2>
<span>XVI </span><span id="S16.1.1">How Can Universities Help?</span>
</h2>

<p id="S16.p1.1">As much as industry might be willing to help, the primary initiative should come from those universities that wish to drive innovation. Universities have a strong initiative to stay on top of (or if possible be in the driving seat for) AI research for many reasons, including their role in educating students who will look for jobs in a world transformed by AI, and the many ways in which AI systems transform education&nbsp;<cite>[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="">12</a>]</cite>. It is worth noting that many of the most influential papers in AI involve a university department. Those papers are typically co-authored by researchers that either collaborate with or are involved in a company. The successful examples are out there <cite>[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="">3</a>]</cite>, but more is needed from the university’s end to enable such partnerships. And actually, there are many ways an academic institution can initiate and foster collaboration with the industry.</p>
<p id="S16.p2.1">Universities can also help their faculty manage the changed competitive landscape by encouraging and allowing them to be more risk-taking. The comparative advantage of academic researchers in AI is to do more high-risk exploration, and incentive structures at universities must change to account for this. For example, it is unreasonable to expect a steady stream of papers at top-tier conferences such as NeurIPS and AAAI; large, well-funded industry research labs will have large advantages at writing such papers. Similarly, the grant funding structure is such that it rewards safe and incremental research on popular topics; this seems to be an inherent feature of the way grant applications are evaluated, and it is unlikely to change however often funding agencies use words like “disruptive”. The kind of research that is favored by some of the most traditional (closed-call) grant mechanisms is mostly the kind of research where academic AI researchers will not be able to compete with industry. Therefore, universities should probably avoid making grant funding a condition for hires and promotions. If universities are serious about incentivizing their faculty to leverage their competitive advantage, they should reward trying and failing and promote high-risk high-gain funding schemes and research initiatives. It is then likely that funding agencies will follow the trend and invest even more on basic and blue sky research.</p>
<p id="S16.p3.1">Such a mindset might further open the possibilities for academics to attract large amounts of funding and collectively start building their own large (foundation) models that would be entirely open to any researcher. European research funding, for instance, has long supported the AI-on-Demand Platform<span id="footnote2"><sup>2</sup><span><span><sup>2</sup><span>2</span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.ai4europe.eu/" title="">https://www.ai4europe.eu/</a></span></span></span>—a community-driven channel featuring open access AI tools—that could host such collaborative efforts on model building and sharing. The seeds of collaborative open-source projects are already planted; think of StarCoder, the recent large model built by an open-science community involving both universities and industrial partners <cite>[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="">11</a>]</cite>. We feel it is only a matter of time that more and larger academic-driven models and data will be shared openly.</p>

<span>XVII </span><span id="S17.1.1">Parting Words</span>
</h2>

<p id="S17.p1.1">We wrote this Point of View article with several purposes in mind. First, to share our concerns with other fellow AI researchers with a hope of finding a common cause (and a collective remedy?) as a community. Second, to offer a set of guidelines based on our own experiences but also the discussions we had in the academic and industrial AI venues we participate or organize. Third, to spur an open dialogue and solicit ideas for potentially more efficient strategies for us all. Arguably, the list of strategies we ended up discussing here are far from inclusive of all possibilities that are available out there; we believe, however, that they are seeds of a conversation that—in our opinion—is very timely.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Reference resolution is an important problem, one that is essential to understand and successfully handle context of different kinds. This context includes both previous turns and context that pertains to non-conversational entities, such as entities on the user's screen or those running in the background. While LLMs have been shown to be extremely powerful for a variety of tasks, their use in reference resolution, particularly for non-conversational entities, remains underutilized. This paper demonstrates how LLMs can be used to create an extremely effective system to resolve references of various types, by showing how reference resolution can be converted into a language modeling problem, despite involving forms of entities like those on screen that are not traditionally conducive to being reduced to a text-only modality. We demonstrate large improvements over an existing system with similar functionality across different types of references, with our smallest model obtaining absolute gains of over 5% for on-screen references. We also benchmark against GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, with our smallest model achieving performance comparable to that of GPT-4, and our larger models substantially outperforming it.

<p>
Versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 of the
<a href="https://git.tukaani.org/?p=xz.git;a=summary">XZ</a>
compression utility and library
were shipped with <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/967180">a backdoor</a> that targeted
<a href="https://www.openssh.com/">OpenSSH</a>.
Andres Freund
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/oss-security/20240329155126.kjjfduxw2yrlxgzm@awork3.anarazel.de/">
discovered</a> the backdoor by
noticing that <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/967194/">failed SSH logins were taking a lot of
CPU time</a> while doing some
micro-benchmarking, and tracking down the backdoor from there. It was introduced
by XZ co-maintainer "Jia Tan" — a probable alias for person or persons unknown.
The backdoor is a sophisticated attack with multiple parts, from the build
system, to link time, to run time.
</p>

<p>
The community response to the attack is just as interesting as the technical
aspects. For more information on that, refer to <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/967866">this
companion article</a>.
</p>

<h4>Build time</h4>

<p>
The backdoor consists of several distinct phases, starting when the package is
being built. Gynvael Coldwind wrote
<a href="https://gynvael.coldwind.pl/?lang=en&amp;id=782">an in-depth investigation</a>
of the build-time parts of the backdoor.
Releases of XZ were provided via GitHub, which has since disabled
the maintainers' accounts and taken the releases offline. Like many projects that
use <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/">GNU Autoconf</a>,
XZ made releases that provided
several versions of the source for
download — an automatically generated tarball containing the source and related
files in the repository, along with versions containing the generated
build files. Those extra files include the <tt>configure</tt> script and makefiles for
the project.
Releasing
versions that contain the generated files allows downstream users of the software to
build without needing to install Autoconf.
</p>

<p>
In this case, however, the scripts in the maintainer-provided source tarballs
were not generated by Autoconf. Instead, one of the build scripts
contained the first stage of the exploit in <tt>m4/build-to-host.m4</tt>. This
script is originally from the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib/">Gnulib</a>
library; it provides a macro that converts
between the style of pathname used by the build environment and the
run-time environment of the program.
The version in these XZ releases was modified to extract the next stage
of the exploit, which is contained in
<tt>tests/files/bad-3-1corrupt_lzma2.xz</tt>.
</p>

<p>
This file is included in the repository, ostensibly as part of XZ's test suite,
though it was never used by those tests. It was committed well before the
release of version 5.6.0. The file, supposedly a corrupted XZ file,
is actually a valid XZ stream with some bytes
swapped — for example, <tt>0x20</tt> is swapped with occurrences of <tt>0x09</tt>
and vice versa.
When decoded, it yields <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/967979">a shell script</a> that
unpacks and executes the next stage of the backdoor.
</p>

<p>
The next stage of the backdoor is located in
<tt>tests/files/good-large_compressed.lzma</tt>. This is the
<tt>injected.txt</tt> file
attached to Freund's message. That file contains more than just the
next stage of the script — it also contains additional binary data that forms
the actual backdoor itself. The final script skips over the header of the file
from which it was extracted, and then uses <tt>awk</tt> to decrypt the remainder
of the file. Finally, that decrypted stream is
decompressed using the XZ command-line program,
in order to extract a pre-compiled file called
<tt>liblzma_la-crc64-fast.o</tt>, which is also attached to Freund's message.
</p>

<h4>Link time</h4>

<p>
The extracted file is a 64-bit relocatable ELF library.
The remainder of the build process links it into the final <tt>liblzma</tt>
library which ends up being loaded into OpenSSH on some distributions.
Those distributions
<a href="https://sources.debian.org/patches/openssh/1:9.2p1-2%2Bdeb12u2/systemd-readiness.patch/">
patch</a> OpenSSH to use systemd for daemon-readiness notifications;
<tt>libsystemd</tt> in turn depends on liblzma for compressing journal files.
Lennart Poettering has since
<a href="https://mastodon.social/@pid_eins/112202687764571433">posted</a> some
example code showing how to let applications use systemd readiness notifications without
pulling in the entire library.
When the malicious
<tt>liblzma</tt> is used by a dynamically linked process, it uses the
<a href="https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/GNU_IFUNC">indirect function</a>
mechanism to involve itself in the <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/961117">linking process</a>.
</p>

<p>
Indirect functions are a feature of the GNU C library (glibc) that permits a developer to
include several versions of a function and select which version to use at
dynamic linking time. Indirect functions are useful for including optimized versions of a
function that rely on specific hardware features, for example. In this case, the
backdoor provides its own version of the indirect function
resolvers <tt>crc32_resolve()</tt> and <tt>crc64_resolve()</tt> that select
versions of <tt>crc32()</tt> and <tt>crc64()</tt> to use, respectively.
<tt>liblzma</tt> does not usually use indirect functions, but using faster
functions to calculate checksums does sound like a plausible use of the feature.
This plausible deniability is probably why the exploit itself lives in a file
called <tt>liblzma_la-crc64-fast.o</tt>.
</p>

<p>
When the dynamic linker finalizes the locations of those functions, it
calls the backdoor's resolver functions. At
this point, dynamic linking is still in progress, so many of the
linker's internal data structures have not yet been made read-only. This would
let the backdoor manipulate libraries that had already been loaded by
overwriting entries in the procedure linkage table (PLT) or global offset table
(GOT). However, <tt>liblzma</tt> is loaded fairly early in the link order of
OpenSSH, which
means that the <a href="https://www.openssl.org/">OpenSSL</a>
cryptography functions that are the backdoor's ultimate
target may not have been loaded yet.
</p>

<p>
To deal with that, the backdoor adds an
<a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/rtld-audit.7.html">
audit hook</a>. The dynamic linker calls all the registered audit hooks
when it is resolving a symbol. The backdoor uses this to wait until it
sees the <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/3/rsa_public_decrypt">
<tt>RSA_public_decrypt@got.plt</tt></a> symbol being resolved. Despite the
name, this function is actually part of handling an RSA signature (which is a
decryption operation) — OpenSSH calls
it while validating an RSA certificate provided by the client
during a connection.
</p>

<h4>Run time</h4>

<p>
Once the backdoor detects this function being linked, it replaces the function
with its
own version. What the altered version does is still being investigated, but at
least one of its functions is to attempt to extract a command from the
public-key
field of the provided RSA certificate (which means that certificates that are
used in this attack cannot actually be used to authenticate normally).
The backdoor checks whether the command is
signed by the attacker's private key and has valid formatting. If it does, then
the backdoor directly runs the given command as the user running <tt>sshd</tt>,
which is usually root.
</p>

<p>
Anthony Weems has put together
<a href="https://github.com/amlweems/xzbot">an explanation</a> of the run-time
portion of the exploit, including a honeypot to detect attempts to use the
exploit, and code to generate command payloads.
Using the backdoor involves signing the command to be executed with a private
key, but the attacker's is not available, so the backdoored server needs to be
patched to use another private key.
This also means that detecting backdoored servers remotely is nearly
impossible, since they will not react any differently to connections that don't
use the attacker's private key.
</p>

<p>
Ultimately, the effect of the backdoor appears to be that a compromised SSH
server which receives a connection with a hand-crafted RSA certificate for
authentication can be made to run attacker-controlled code.
</p>

<h4>Anti-analysis</h4>

<p>
The design of the backdoor makes it difficult to notice without directly inspecting
<tt>liblzma</tt>. For example, the choice to enable remote code execution rather
than an authentication bypass means that use of the exploit does not detect a
login session that could be noticed by traditional administration tools.
The backdoor's code
also uses several techniques to make discovery more
difficult.
For example, the string "RSA_public_decrypt@got.plt",
which is used by the audit hook, never appears in the binary of the exploit.
Instead, it uses a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie">trie</a>
to hold various strings. Serge Bazanski posted
<a href="https://gist.github.com/q3k/af3d93b6a1f399de28fe194add452d01">a
list</a> of strings in the malicious <tt>liblzma</tt> encoded this way.
</p>

<p>
Examining that list shows that <tt>RSA_public_decrypt</tt> is likely not the
only function interfered with; several other cryptography routines are listed.
It also shows various functions and strings that are used to interfere with
OpenSSH's logging. This is not yet confirmed, but it seems likely that a
compromised SSH server would not actually log any connection attempts that use
the exploit.
</p>

<p>
The backdoor also includes many checks to ensure it is running in the expected
environment — a standard precaution for modern malware that is intended to make
reverse-engineering more difficult. The backdoor is only active
under specific circumstances, including: running in a non-graphical
environment, as root, in a binary located at <tt>/usr/sbin/sshd</tt>, with
<tt>sshd</tt> having the expected ELF header, and where none
of its functions have had a breakpoint inserted by a debugger. Despite these
obstacles,
community efforts to reverse-engineer and explain the remainder of the
backdoor's code
<a href="https://gist.github.com/smx-smx/a6112d54777845d389bd7126d6e9f504">
remain underway</a>.
</p>

<p>
The backdoor also includes code that patches the binary of <tt>sshd</tt> itself
to disable <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp.2.html">
<tt>seccomp()</tt></a> and prevent the program from creating a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot">chroot sandbox</a> for
its children. In total, the code of the backdoor is 87KB, which is plenty of
space for additional unpleasant surprises. Many people have put together their
own summaries of the exploit, including
<a href="https://gist.github.com/thesamesam/223949d5a074ebc3dce9ee78baad9e27">
this comprehensive FAQ</a> by Sam James, which links to other resources.
</p>

<h4>Being safe</h4>

<p>
The exploit was caught promptly, so almost no users were affected. Debian sid,
Fedora Rawhide, the Fedora 40 beta,
openSUSE Tumbleweed, and Kali Linux all briefly shipped the
compromised package. NixOS unstable also shipped the compromised version, but was not
vulnerable because it does not patch OpenSSH to link <tt>libsystemd</tt>.
Tan also included
some other changes to the XZ code to make detecting and mitigating the backdoor
more difficult, such as
<a href="https://git.tukaani.org/?p=xz.git;a=blobdiff;f=CMakeLists.txt;h=d2b1af7ab0ab759b6805ced3dff2555e2a4b3f8e;hp=76700591059711e3a4da5b45cf58474dac4e12a7;hb=328c52da8a2bbb81307644efdb58db2c422d9ba7;hpb=eb8ad59e9bab32a8d655796afd39597ea6dcc64d">
sabotaging</a> sandboxing measures and making preemptive efforts to redirect
security reports. Even though the exploit did not reach their stable versions,
several distributions are nonetheless
taking steps to move to a version of XZ that does not contain
any commits from Tan, so users should expect to see security updates related to
that soon. Readers may also
wish to refer to the security notice for their distribution for more specific

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3><strong>By Gwen C. Katz</strong></h3><p><span>Why is early speculative fiction so grim?</span></p><p><span>From potions that turn people into psychopathic murderers to alien invasions only defeated by coincidental quirks of biology, turn-of-the-20th-century sci-fi carries a distinct tone that the arc of history bends towards catastrophe. Most commentators have looked to social and political factors to explain this tone. There are plenty to choose from—runaway income inequality, rampant corruption, crushing working-class living conditions. These issues were certainly present in the minds of early sci-fi authors, many of whom—such as H.G. Wells, who drafted a precursor to the UN Declaration of Human Rights—were progressive reformists.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>But there’s another factor that isn’t often mentioned: They thought the sun was on the brink of death.</span></p><p><span>Contextualizing stories to their moment in the history of science is more difficult than placing them within political and social history. We don’t all take mandatory science history classes in school. Yet important scientific discoveries have a major impact on culture, from Cold War nuclear anxiety to the neon-drenched cyberpunk of the early computer era. And in the 19</span><span>th</span><span> and early 20</span><span>th</span><span> centuries, one of the biggest unanswered scientific questions was: How does the sun work?</span></p><p><span>During the Age of Enlightenment (yes, we really are starting that far back), as the scientific method replaced religion as the explanation for physical phenomena, the predominant scientific belief was that the universe and the bodies within it were endless. If God didn’t create the universe 6000 years ago, maybe it had simply always existed. Observationally, the sun has always been there throughout human history and it’s just as bright today as it was yesterday, so it’s logical to conclude that it will always be there. This basic belief in the static nature of the universe proved to be a hurdle for many scientific discoveries—for instance, one of the reasons the theory of evolution took time to be accepted was that extinction was not a widely-accepted phenomenon.</span></p><p><span>Science fiction was not yet a codified genre in this era, and few other than theologians were pondering the eventual fate of the earth. Yet there were premonitions. In 1815, Mount Tambora exploded in the most powerful volcanic eruption in recorded history. The resultant ash darkened skies around the world and plunged the planet into a cold spell dubbed The Year Without a Summer.</span></p><p><span>In the midst of this, Lord Byron wrote his 1816 poem </span><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43825/darkness-56d222aeeee1b"><i><span>Darkness</span></i></a><span>, envisioning a world where the sun never returned:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>The bright sun was extinguish’d, and the stars</span></p><p><span>Did wander darkling in the eternal space,</span></p><p><span>Rayless, and pathless, and the icy earth</span></p><p><span>Swung blind and blackening in the moonless air…</span></p><p><span>The waves were dead; the tides were in their grave,</span></p><p><span>The moon, their mistress, had expir’d before;</span></p><p><span>The winds were wither’d in the stagnant air,</span></p><p><span>And the clouds perish’d; Darkness had no need</span></p><p><span>Of aid from them—She was the Universe.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Byron’s primary focus was the human drama of these final days, and he drew primarily from imagination, not scientific theory. Yet his vision of a frozen, sunless earth foreshadowed later discoveries with remarkable prescience.</span></p><p><span>The codifying of the laws of thermodynamics in the mid-19</span><span>th</span><span> century prompted a major reevaluation of scientists’ assumptions about the universe. The first law of thermodynamics stated that energy had to come from somewhere. The second stated that it had to eventually run out.</span></p><p><span>Outside of fundamentalist Christian circles, most natural laws don’t inspire strong emotional reactions beyond interest and curiosity. But there’s a certain ennui to the second law of thermodynamics. While the billiard-hall laws of Newtonian mechanics run just as happily in reverse, entropy does not. It leaks out from every system, every interaction, always larger than before. What is broken can never be truly mended, it reminds us. What is lost can never be truly regained. Your every action, however mindful, is one more step on the inevitable journey to the heat-death of the universe.</span></p><p><span>The sun could no longer simply be an infinite energy source in the sky. The&nbsp; magnificent beacon’s energy had to be finite, and it had to be caused by something. But what? Such a vast amount of power was a major challenge to the 19</span><span>th</span><span>-century model of physics.</span></p><p><span>The first explanation was offered by Robert Mayer in 1848, and again by Lord Kelvin a few years later: The sun is glowing because meteors are constantly crashing into it. This theory raised immediate and obvious problems. Where are all these meteors coming from? Why can’t we see them? </span><i><span>How are we not all dead</span></i><span>, since the meteors would presumably be raining their fiery fury on the earth at the same rate? “No doubt meteors fall into the sun, as assumed by Mayer and Thomson [Kelvin],” </span><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-age-of-the-sun-and-the-earth/"><span>wrote Florian Cajori</span></a><span> for </span><i><span>Scientific American</span></i><span> in 1908, “but the Mayer-Thomson theory made demands upon these meteors that bordered on extravagance.”</span></p><p><span>The first tenable explanation arrived in 1854 by Herman von Helmholtz: Gravitational contraction. As the heavy sun collapses under its own weight, the immense heat and pressure cause it to incandesce. Mathematically, this works. Stars are blackbodies, a type of material that’s black when cool and glows different colors when heated in a predictable sequence: Red, orange, yellow, white, and at its hottest, blue (iron being forged is a familiar example, though it never gets hot enough to glow blue). This suggested a very simple stellar life cycle: Hot, blue-white stars must be the youngest, gradually cooling to yellow, then red, before ceasing to glow altogether.</span></p><p><span>Moreover, unlike the mystery meteors, this theory is finite and quantifiable. Eventually, the sun would finish collapsing, the heat would dissipate, and it would slowly cool and darken into an inert lump of…stuff. (They were still hazy on that point; as late as the 1920s Arthur Eddington would be using models that assumed stars were almost entirely iron.) Knowing its mass, they could calculate how fast this would happen. So for the first time, it was possible to estimate the lifetime of the sun.</span></p><p><span>And the number was not large.</span></p><p><span>Initial estimates put the sun’s lifespan at around 20 million years. It could hardly be much younger than that, so its lifetime appeared to be mostly over. Soon it would burn out. What about the earth? It would freeze over, its orbit would decay, and it would draw closer to the husk of the sun, becoming tidally locked. Ultimately, it would fall into the remains of the sun and be destroyed, but not until long after all life went extinct. Humanity had, perhaps, a couple million years left before the sky darkened and the earth succumbed to eternal winter. Not a cheery thought.</span></p><p><span>Of course, a million years is hardly an imminent deadline on a human timescale—it’s still a hundred times the duration of all human civilization to date—but nevertheless, the idea that our world’s time was mostly up cast a bit of a pall.</span></p><p><span>Smack in the middle of these discussions, the natural world provided a most vivid illustration. In 1883, Krakatoa erupted nearly as violently as Tambora, ushering in another volcanic winter. (The 1800s were not a good century for volcanoes. Unless you were a geologist.) For the scientifically-minded, it must have felt like a premonition of earth’s eventual fate.</span></p><p><span>And yet the gravitation theory didn’t add up. For one thing, there was geology. While astrophysicists examined the sun, geologists were estimating the age of the earth based on its internal temperature, and their research dated the earth to some hundreds of millions or billions of years old. Biologists studying fossils estimated a similar age. Everyone agreed that the sun had to be older than the earth, so where did the discrepancy lie? “Lord Kelvin,” </span><a href="https://zenodo.org/records/1429642"><span>quoth Eddington</span></a><span> in 1920, “…made strenuous efforts to induce geologists and biologists to accommodate their demands to this time-scale. I do not think they proved altogether tractable.”</span></p><p><span>For another thing, if the light came from incandescence, what on earth was a pulsar? Surely a star couldn’t be alternately collapsing and un-collapsing.</span></p><p><span>Still, gravitation was the best anyone had, and this theory was taught to students for a solid seventy years. Among these students were the early luminaries of science fiction. The image of the earth’s long, slow descent into an endless ice age lodged itself firmly into their voracious minds, to percolate out in their works. Sometimes this was subconscious, in the form of the melancholic speculative fiction that dominated the genre’s early years. Other times, the sun’s imminent demise and its effect on humanity are the subject of the story itself: The dying-earth genre, which peaked in the first decades of the 20</span><span>th</span><span> century.</span></p><p><span>The most well-known example is </span><a href="https://gutenberg.org/cache/epub/35/pg35-images.html#chap14"><i><span>The Time Machine</span></i></a><span> by H.G. Wells (1895). In one of the book’s most memorable scenes, in a frenzied struggle to escape the Morlocks, the Time Traveler accidentally sends his machine forward in time instead of back and briefly journeys to the end of the Earth. The scene that greets him is a dismal one:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>The sky was no longer blue. North-eastward it was inky black, and out of the blackness shone brightly and steadily the pale white stars. Overhead it was a deep Indian red and starless, and south-eastward it grew brighter to a glowing scarlet where, cut by the horizon, lay the huge hull of the sun, red and motionless…There were no breakers and no waves, for not a breath of wind was stirring. Only a slight oily swell rose and fell like a gentle breathing, and showed that the eternal sea was still moving and living…</span></p><p><span>I cannot convey the sense of abominable desolation that hung over the world. The red eastern sky, the northward blackness, the salt Dead Sea, the stony beach crawling with these foul, slow-stirring monsters, the uniform poisonous-looking green of the lichenous plants, the thin air that hurts one’s lungs: all contributed to an appalling effect…</span></p><p><span>All the sounds of man, the bleating of sheep, the cries of birds, the hum of insects, the stir that makes the background of our lives—all that was over.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>The bright red sky evokes the dramatic volcanic sunsets following Krakatoa, which, twelve years later, must have still been a vivid memory. The still, lifeless sea recalls Byron.</span></p><p><span>But of particular note is the large, motionless red sun. The description resembles a red giant, and other than the cold temperature it would be easy to mistake this for modern astrophysics, where growing into a red giant marks the end of the sun’s life. In fact, Wells is depicting something completely different: The earth growing much closer to the sun due to orbital decay. Tidally locked, it no longer has day and night, but exists in a perpetual twilight with the sun fixed in a single place. The sun is larger because it’s closer; it’s red because it’s a cooling blackbody. The image of the large, red, cold, stationary sun would appear over and over in melancholic science fiction.</span></p><p><span>But horror author/sailor/bodybuilder William Hope Hodgson proved to be the champion of the dying-earth genre. Hodgson (who was an impressionable six-year-old at the time of Krakatoa) returned to this well twice at length. The first was his slightly brilliant, entirely delirious 1908 novel </span><i><span>The House on the Borderland</span></i><span>. In its </span><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/10002/pg10002-images.html#XVII"><span>extended flash-forward sequence</span></a><span>, he flexes his understanding of the scientific theory of the day, describing the sun as:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>…a tremendous globe of a glowing copper-bronze hue; in parts ringed with blood-red bands; in others, with the dusky ones, that I have already mentioned…these markings were due, probably, to differences in temperature of the various areas; the red representing those parts where the heat was still fervent, and the black those portions which were already comparatively cool.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>In a moment of drama, the sun devours Mercury:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>All at once, during one of these periods of life, a sudden flame cut across the night—a quick glare that lit up the dead earth, shortly; giving me a glimpse of its flat lonesomeness. The light appeared to come from the sun—shooting out from somewhere near its center, diagonally. A moment, I gazed, startled. Then the leaping flame sank, and the gloom fell again. But now it was not so dark; and the sun was belted by a thin line of vivid, white light. I stared, intently. Had a volcano broken out on the sun? Yet, I negatived the thought, as soon as formed. I felt that the light had been far too intensely white, and large, for such a cause.</span></p><p><span>Another idea there was, that suggested itself to me. It was, that one of the inner planets had fallen into the sun—becoming incandescent, under that impact…</span></p><p><span>After that one burst of flame, the light had shown, only as an encircling band of bright fire. Now, however, as I watched, it began slowly to sink into a ruddy tint, and, later, to a dark, copper-red color; much as the sun had done. Presently, it sank to a deeper hue; and, in a still further space of time, it began to fluctuate; having periods of glowing, and anon, dying. Thus, after a great while, it disappeared.</span></p><p><span>Long before this, the smoldering edge of the sun had deadened into blackness. And so, in that supremely future time, the world, dark and intensely silent, rode on its gloomy orbit around the ponderous mass of the dead sun.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Hodgson’s second foray into the death of the earth comes from his magnum opus, </span><a href="https://gutenberg.org/cache/epub/10662/pg10662-images.html"><i><span>The Night Land</span></i></a> <span>(1912), a 600-page slog so notoriously impenetrable that even H.P. Lovecraft </span><a href="https://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/essays/shil.aspx"><span>criticized its</span></a><span> “painful verboseness.” The novel is set millions of years in the future, when the sun has long since burned out and the earth is a frozen wasteland inhabited by monsters. The last few million humans all live in one giant, technologically advanced pyramid, remembering the death of the sun only as a legendary creation story.</span></p><p><span>Hodgson’s depictions contain fanciful embellishments, but they are also peppered with meticulous scientific detail. In </span><i><span>The House on the Borderland</span></i><span>, carbon dioxide precipitates out of the atmosphere and falls as snow, and in the absence of an atmosphere, all sound becomes inaudible. In </span><i><span>The Night Land</span></i><span>, the earth’s crust has cracked as it cooled, creating fissures hundreds of miles deep. In one of the book’s most melancholic moments, the protagonist finds a book predicting that humanity’s remnants might relocate from the frozen surface to the bottom of these fissures, where it was still warm—only to realize that the icy wasteland he inhabits </span><i><span>is</span></i><span> the bottom of the fissure, that humanity made the journey thousands of years ago, and that there is no deeper refuge to flee to.</span></p><p><span>But while Wells and Hodgson were writing, science was progressing. In 1898, an upstart named Marie Curie showed up with some glowing rocks and upended everything.</span></p><p><span>Radium gave off impossibly vast amounts of energy seemingly out of nowhere, in defiance of all known physical laws. Atomic theory, mechanics, astrophysics—all had to rethink their fundamental assumptions in a true scientific revolution. There had to be another source of energy, enormous in magnitude, locked within the atoms themselves.</span></p><p><span>Nuclear energy.</span></p><p><span>Nuclear science opened up intriguing new possibilities to explain the sun. What if it was radiating energy from radioactive isotopes? No more was the sun on the brink of death—radium could fuel the sun for billions of years. And the problem of the sun’s age suddenly dissipated like polonium in a test tube.</span></p><p><span>“The sun is full of radium” may sound like an outlandish theory, but it was more sensible than it seems: scientists knew the sun contained helium (that is, in fact, where helium gets its name), and at the time, the only known source of helium was the radioactive decay of radium.</span></p><p><span>Gravitation did not go down without a fight. Lord Kelvin adamantly defended it against a battalion of younger scientists, including George Darwin (son of That Other Darwin), who Cajori quotes saying, “I think we have no right to assume that the sun is incapable of liberating atomic energy to a degree at least comparable with that which it would do if made of radium.” Despite the evidence against it, the gravitation theory would shamble on for another couple of decades, says Eddington, “not alive, but an unburied corpse.”</span></p><p><span>As it happens, the radium theory wasn’t correct either. It took another couple of decades before Arthur Eddington, in the same 1920 article quoted above, spitballed the theory which ultimately turned out to be correct: “The atoms of all elements are built of hydrogen atoms bound together…wherever it did occur a great amount of energy must have been set free; in a star a vast quantity of energy is being set free which is hitherto unaccounted for. You may draw a conclusion if you like.” In other words, nuclear fusion.</span></p><p><span>Like the radium theory, fusion allowed for a sun that might be billions of years old. These theories offered only a reprieve, but did not alter the ultimate sentence. Regardless of its power source, the sun would eventually run out of fuel, cool off, and go dark. All life on earth would die.</span></p><p><span>These new theories took the “we’re-all-about-to-die” urgency out of the death of the sun, and the dying-earth genre began to lose popularity. Yet the image of the dying sun was still a poignant one. Several sci-fi authors were drawn to the topic in this era, armed with the new scientific knowledge.</span></p><p><span>Now-disgraced sci-fi patriarch John W. Campbell tackled the dying earth in his short story </span><a href="https://archive.org/details/sim_astounding-science-fiction_1935-10_16_2/page/n9/mode/1up"><span>“Night”</span></a><span> (1935, published under the pseudonym Don A. Stuart). An experimental device accidentally transports a pilot to the end of the universe. He is met with an earth long since frozen, its automated machinery broken down long after all humans had perished:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>There were frozen, huddled heaps that might once have been men. Little fellows with fear forever frozen on their faces huddled helplessly over something that must once have been a heating device. Dead perhaps, since the last storm old Earth had known, tens of billions of years ago…</span></p><p><span>Again I saw that agonizing struggle of the eternally faithful machines trying to repair themselves once more to serve their masters who were dead a million million years. I could see it again in the frozen, exhausted postures of the repair machines, stilled forever in their hopeless endeavors, the last poor dregs of energy spilled in fruitless conflict with time.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Campbell was well-versed in the latest science. “From hydrogen,” he says, “the heaviest of elements can be built up, and energy released,” but the stars “had burned their hydrogen until it was a remnant so small the action could not go on.” And this future is not a few millions of years off, but “billions on billions of years,” when not only the sun, but all the stars have burned out.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>And yet the imagery of the sun remains familiar:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>It was four times—six times—the size of the Sun I knew. And it wasn’t setting. It was forty-five degrees from the horizon. It was red. Blood-red. And there wasn’t the slightest bit of radiant heat reaching my face from it. That Sun was cold.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>(Note, however, that Wells’s vivid red sunset is not present. Campbell, born in 1910, did not experience Krakatoa.)</span></p><p><span>Astrophysics can show up in the smallest of traces. Did I mention Lovecraft? In </span><a href="https://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/fiction/sot.aspx"><i><span>The Shadow out of Time</span></i></a><span> (1936), he briefly mentions the Yith’s future fate:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>Later, as the earth’s span closed, the transferred minds would again migrate through time and space—to another stopping-place in the bodies of the bulbous vegetable entities of Mercury. But there would be races after them, clinging pathetically to the cold planet and burrowing to its horror-filled core, before the utter end.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>The Yith moving </span><i><span>inward</span></i><span> in the solar system, not outward, indicates that Lovecraft, like his contemporaries, believed the sun would cool.</span></p><p><span>The modern stellar life cycle took several more years to work out. Red giants were the sticking point. Discovered at the turn of the century, they simply didn’t fit into any of the models. A first guess, during the era of the gravitation theory, suggested that they were young stars. Instead of hottest to coldest, the stellar life cycle moved from largest to smallest. A star began life as a red giant, and then gravitational contraction shrank it into a sunlike star, then a red dwarf. When that didn’t hold up, most astronomers concluded that red giants were their own thing.</span></p><p><span>The idea that red giants were in fact very old stars was first tenuously proposed in 1933, but only seriously considered in 1939. In the years that followed, a series of increasingly sophisticated models made it clear that red giants were a late stage of stellar evolution. Instead of gradually burning out, the sun would inflate into a flaming behemoth. The earth would not “go gently into that good night,” but would be devoured by this ball of fire.</span></p><p><span>The idea of being incinerated by the sun is not exactly a delightful one, but it’s significantly less angsty than the image of the lifeless, cold earth floating for eternity in the black void. Perhaps it’s simply that it’s a quicker end. Or perhaps it’s the part where the red giant collapses, spewing its gasses out across the galaxy to become the next generation of stars. Star stuff we are, and to star stuff we shall return.</span></p><p><span>The image of the earth being devoured by the sun is not without a certain drama of its own, and it makes an occasional appearance in sci-fi to this day. </span><a href="https://www.seizethepress.com/2023/09/04/the-dream-with-no-dreamer-stp8/"><span>“The Dream with no Dreamer”</span></a><span> by Evan Forman (2023) eloquently envisions this end:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>After the cities had been put down and the planet flayed of life, the pyramids and pharaoh’s tombs were melted down to slag beneath the light of an expanding star. Then the buried dead were cremated in liquifying soil, the mountains tucked away into its volcanic folds.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Overall, though, this end just doesn’t have the same narrative potential, and certainly nowhere near the same urgency. Thus, the discovery of the modern stellar life cycle heralded the end of the melancholic depictions of the dying earth. Meanwhile, science fiction at large had evolved from Victorian pessimism to the techno-optimism of the pulp era. The dying-earth genre didn’t vanish on the spot, but it transformed into a stock setting for sword-and-sorcery stories set in the far future where modern civilization’s technology has long since been lost, beginning with Clark Ashton Smith’s </span><i><span>Zothique</span></i><span> stories, and the scientific underpinnings gradually dwindled away. You can see the modern descendants of these stories in the likes of </span><i><span>Horizon Zero Dawn</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>Yet the dying-earth imagery would linger in the minds of a generation of writers who had grown up with it, occasionally percolating to the surface outside of science fiction, in genres that had no reason to be bound by scientific accuracy. In </span><i><span>The Magician’s Nephew</span></i><span> (1955), C.S. Lewis references the image of the burned-out sun to depict the dying world of Charn:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>“Was it the Deplorable Word that made your sun like that?” asked Digory.</span></p><p><span>“Like what?” said Jadis.</span></p><p><span>“So big, so red, and so cold.”</span></p><p><span>“It has always been so,” said Jadis. “At least, for hundreds of thousands of years. Have you a different sort of sun in your world?”</span></p></blockquote><p><span>It wasn’t only sci-fi authors who found literary inspiration in the image of the dying sun. In fact, one of the genres most profoundly affected was poetry. Many prominent poets were deeply interested in the natural world and studied astronomy, and they too were influenced by the melancholia of the dying-earth era.</span></p><p><span>T.S. Eliot was an admirer of Arthur Eddington and kept up on his discoveries. Sometimes this knowledge of astronomy surfaces in his works with great clarity.</span><a href="https://allpoetry.com/the-hollow-men"><span> “The Hollow Men”</span></a><span> (1925) is one of Eliot’s darkest works. Written (by his own admission) during a severe bout of depression, the scarecrow-like titular hollow men whisper meaninglessly to each other in a “valley of dying stars” that bears striking resemblance to the dying-earth stories:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>This is the dead land</span></p><p><span>This is cactus land</span></p><p><span>Here the stone images</span></p><p><span>Are raised, here they receive</span></p><p><span>The supplication of a dead man’s hand</span></p><p><span>Under the twinkle of a fading star.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Cosmic death saturates the poem. The wind is described as “More distant and more solemn/Than a fading star.” “Death’s twilight kingdom” makes several appearances—but is it the underworld or is it a description of earth in its final days, “This last meeting place” where the hollow men hopelessly gather, awaiting an inevitable death like the frozen men from “Night”?</span></p><p><span>The poem ends with the most famous lines of T.S. Eliot’s oeuvre:</span></p><blockquote><p><i><span>This is the way the world ends</span></i></p><p><i><span>This is the way the world ends</span></i></p><p><i><span>This is the way the world ends</span></i></p><p><i><span>Not with a bang but a whimper.</span></i></p></blockquote><p><span>The “bang” here is the Apocalypse that marks the end of the earth in traditional Christian theology (not, as one might guess, a supernova). In the depths of depression, Eliot rejects the church’s image of a fiery doomsday, finding more to relate to in the painfully slow, cold death offered by science.</span></p><p><span>Nor was he the only poet to observe the dichotomy between the cold death presented by science and the hot death presented by religion. But first, a story. There is an </span><a href="https://www.amerlit.com/poems/POEMS%20Frost,%20Robert%20Fire%20and%20Ice%20(1920%201923)%20analysis%20by%204%20critics.pdf"><span>oft-repeated anecdote</span></a><span> that, in 1920, Robert Frost asked astronomer Harlow Shapley how the world would end, and Shapley told him that it would either be incinerated by the sun, or somehow escape and slowly freeze—and was blindsided a few months later when a reference to this conversation appeared in a poem.</span></p><p><span>You should find this story immediately suspect. Neither Shapley nor anyone else in 1920 had any reason to think the sun would destroy the earth. And the provenance of the story doesn’t inspire confidence: Frost commentator Tom Hansen claimed in 2000 that Shapley had related the story in a talk in 1960. The meteor theory had more compelling evidence than this. So, unfortunately, we’ve got to mark this one as an urban legend.</span></p><p><span>But Frost </span><i><span>did</span></i><span> enjoy astronomy, and it makes an appearance in many of his poems. In </span><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44273/the-star-splitter"><span>“The Star-Splitter”</span></a><span> (1923), a farmer buys a telescope “To satisfy a lifelong curiosity/About our place among the infinities.” And he kept up with the latest discoveries. </span><a href="https://www.englishliterature.info/2021/07/skeptic-by-robert-frost-analysis.html"><span>“Skeptic”</span></a><span> (1947), for instance, references Edwin Hubble’s discovery of redshift (while simultaneously expressing doubt about it:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>I don’t believe what makes you red in the face</span></p><p><span>Is after explosion going away so fast.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>So while Shapley may never have spoken to frost, we have every reason to believe that Frost had theories of the death of the sun in mind when he wrote his 1920 poem </span><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44263/fire-and-ice"><span>“Fire and Ice”</span></a><span>. You already know the poem—some of you, no doubt, by heart—but I’m including it here anyways:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>Some say the world will end in fire,</span></p><p><span>Some say in ice.</span></p><p><span>From what I’ve tasted of desire</span></p><p><span>I hold with those who favor fire.</span></p><p><span>But if it had to perish twice,</span></p><p><span>I think I know enough of hate</span></p><p><span>To say that for destruction ice</span></p><p><span>Is also great</span></p><p><span>And would suffice.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>The poem’s metaphorical message is so resonant that it’s easy to overlook its literal meaning. Scientists at the time really did believe the world would end in ice, disagreeing with theologians, who claimed it would end in fire. For Frost, this disagreement about the physical world created an analogy for the different forms of human cruelty.</span></p><p><span>And so our journey takes us from the roots of science fiction to perhaps the most famous poem of the 20</span><span>th</span><span> century. It’s a cosmic microcosm of the creative arts’ relationship to all science: Curiosity and inspiration mingled with doubt and pessimism, the love of discovery colliding with the fear that we might wish we had never found out.</span></p><p><span>For while the dying-earth genre came to an end in the 1940s, physics was not done inspiring nihilistic visions of the future. I leave you with one final prescient quote from Arthur Eddington: “If, indeed, the sub-atomic energy in the stars is being freely used to maintain their great furnaces, it seems to bring a little nearer to fulfilment our dream of controlling this latent power for the well-being of the human race—or for its suicide.”&nbsp;</span><img decoding="async" src="https://e7tj565ac8j.exactdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/cropped_transparent_T.png." data-src="https://e7tj565ac8j.exactdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/cropped_transparent_T.png." alt=""></p><h5>Gwen C.

</span></p></div></figure><p>In a clearing in the Brazilian Amazon, I stood with a group of armed men, discussing a viral TikTok video. The video, shot from a helicopter full of illegal miners, showed a vast stretch of rain forest, with dense foliage extending in all directions. The only sign of human habitation was below: a dirt circle surrounded by fanlike lean-tos made of wooden poles and palm fronds. It was a <em>maloca</em>, a traditional compound of the Yanomami, an Indigenous group that inhabits a remote territory in the rain forest of northern Brazil.</p><p>As the helicopter hovered, five Yanomami ran into the clearing, gazing up at the intruders. Several lifted bows and shot arrows. The miners whooped with derisive laughter. “Look at the cannibals,” one of them cried. Another said, “Go on, throw the arrow,” before telling his friends, “Let’s get out of here.” They flew away, yelling, “Bunch of faggots!”</p><p>For many viewers, the video was a rare document of an encounter with <em>isolados</em>—members of a Yanomami community living with no links to the outside world. For the armed men I was with, it was evidence: a potential lead in a high-profile initiative, sponsored by President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, to dislodge thousands of illicit miners from Yanomami territory.</p><p>The men—fighters with combat gear and assault rifles—belonged to a tiny special-forces unit known as the Specialized Inspection Group, or G.E.F. Most of them wore face coverings; mining in the rain forest is increasingly infiltrated by violent criminals, making it dangerous for them to reveal their identity. The G.E.F.’s leader and co-founder was Felipe Finger, a wiry man in his forties with a salt-and-pepper beard. Finger trained in forestry engineering, and his unit works under the Brazilian ministry for the environment. But he has spent much of his adult life in armed operations to protect the wilderness, and he talks like a soldier, with frequent references to operations and objectives and neutralizing threats. The current mission was known to national authorities as Operation Freedom. Finger and his men called it Operation Xapirí, from a Yanomami word for nature spirits.</p><p>The group formed a circle as Finger laid out the day’s targets. On a G.P.S., he pointed to a yellow circle showing where the <em>isolados</em> had been harassed in the TikTok video, and then red dots, representing the miners, in an irregular cluster around them. Miners had been detected roughly eight miles from the <em>isolados</em>—meaning that they had penetrated dangerously far into a protected ecosystem. “Wherever they go, the miners destroy everything, entire river systems,” Finger said indignantly. “And they do it at the expense of these highly vulnerable people.”</p><p>The Amazon faces many threats. The constant proliferation of road networks—both legal and illegal—brings new settlements, and growing human populations burn forests to clear land for cattle and crops. The rain forest is enduring an unprecedented drought, and in Roraima, the state where the Yanomami territory is situated, wildfires set off by such slash-and-burn efforts have spread out of control; more than four thousand square miles burned there this year, releasing vast amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. But mining for gold and cassiterite, a mineral used in electronics, exacerbates the environmental problems with singular ferocity. Wildcat miners, using giant excavators, dredgers, and mercury, can devastate miles of river and forest in a matter of days. With the price of gold now above two thousand dollars an ounce on the global market, a rush is under way in the Amazon, and illegal prospecting accounts for more than half of Brazil’s supply.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>The G.E.F. team was travelling to its targets in two helicopters. Finger took the lead, along with another founder of the unit—Roberto Cabral, a boyish-looking man of fifty-five. When a mine site was found, their chopper would go in first, in case there was gunfire.</p><p>As the helicopters picked their way through the forest, Finger radioed to say that he had “a situation.” We followed G.P.S. coördinates to a river bend, where his chopper had landed on a sandbank. Just upriver was a boat, loaded with equipment and fuel cannisters—a miner’s supply launch. Finger and several of his men waded toward it, their weapons drawn, but its occupants had fled. While we looked on, the G.E.F. men torched the boat, a plume of fire rising from the water.</p><p>A few miles downriver, the helicopters paused over a scarred patch of jungle and a carved-out stretch of riverbank: a mine that the team had destroyed in a previous operation. There was no evidence that digging had resumed, but not far off were signs of another miners’ camp: a huddle of plastic tents barely visible beneath the tree canopy. In a clearing at the edge of the river, the miners had driven rows of cut saplings into the dirt—a low-tech defense against landing helicopters. Eventually, Finger found a way to set down, and his men yanked the poles from the sand and threw them aside.</p><p>The team fanned out and searched for miners, but there was no one in sight. When the G.E.F. can’t catch <em>garimpeiros</em>, as the illegal miners are called, the goal is to destroy their camps and their equipment: excavators, planes, house-size dredging rafts used to dig up the river bottom. The team quickly found the mine pit, an ugly gouge of muddy water with a pump, a giant hose, and a sluice, along with a truck engine that served as a generator. Using cans of fuel left by the miners, they doused the machinery and lit it on fire. For good measure, one of them peppered the generator with bullets.</p><p>While a few men stood guard, scanning the forest edges, others moved through the tents and a cookhouse area, searching for anything that might provide a clue to who controls the mines. (Some were makeshift local operations; others were run by crime syndicates or shadow investors in major cities.) Then they piled up flammable materials and set the rest of the camp ablaze.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>As we watched the fire spread, a small plane buzzed away over the trees. It belonged to the miners, Cabral said; they must have been warned that the G.E.F. was coming. He pointed to a white rectangular antenna on a tall pole in the center of the camp and said, “Starlink”—Elon Musk’s portable satellite-communications system. One of the men hacked at the pole with a machete until it toppled, and Finger broke the antenna and took the modem. The G.E.F. fighters are well trained, and equipped with satellite imaging, combat gear, assault rifles, and night-vision goggles provided by the U.S. State Department. Increasingly, though, their opponents have similar resources. The day’s raid had destroyed a facility that might have employed a dozen miners. The number of people involved in illegal mining in the Brazilian Amazon is believed to be as many as half a million.</p><p>For four years, Lula’s predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro, insisted that the crisis in the rain forest was an elaborate hoax. A far-right former military officer who embraced Donald Trump as an ally and a role model, Bolsonaro maintained that advocates for the environment and for Indigenous rights were part of a communist-globalist conspiracy. He ran for the Presidency promising to dismantle environmental safeguards, and his supporters took him at his word. He assumed office in January, 2019, and within months an estimated twenty thousand <em>garimpeiros</em> were at work in Yanomami land. Despite Yanomami leaders’ pleas for help and a Supreme Court judge’s order for the miners to be forced out, Bolsonaro did nothing.</p><p>Lula, a veteran left-wing politician who served as Brazil’s President from 2003 to 2010, took office again last year, after a perilously close election. By then, the Yanomami were enduring a crisis, with malaria, hunger, and infant malnutrition spreading widely; hundreds of children had died. Outsiders committed growing numbers of rapes and murders, including incidents in which miners on motorboats shot and teargassed Yanomami as they sped past a riverside community.</p><figure><p><span><div data-attr-viewport-monitor=""><a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a28077&quot;}" href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a28077" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><picture></picture></a><p><span>“By the power vested in me, from this day forth you may text each other as many times in a row as you want without worrying that you’re coming across as desperate.”</span></p><p><span>Cartoon by Ali Solomon and Miriam Jayaratna</span></p></div></span></p></figure><p>The crisis gave Lula an opportunity to present himself as a savior, and in one of his first acts as President he flew to Boa Vista, the capital of Roraima. He toured a clinic that treated Indigenous patients, and in emotional remarks afterward he blamed Bolsonaro for “the neglect and abandonment of the Yanomami.” It was “more than a humanitarian crisis,” he added. “What I saw was a genocide.” He vowed to end illegal mining on Indigenous land, just as he had vowed, during the campaign, to achieve “zero deforestation” in the rain forest by 2030. “The planet needs the Amazon alive,” he said.</p><p>Lula declared a public-health emergency and ordered an ambitious series of raids to eject the miners. After operations began, in February, 2023, dramatic footage emerged of security forces surging in and destroying equipment, and of miners fleeing the forest. By June, Lula declared the Yanomami land “free of illegal mining.” Soon afterward, his government promoted new statistics showing that illegal deforestation in the Amazon had fallen thirty-four per cent in six months.</p><p>Last August, in the city of Belém, Lula presided over a meeting of regional heads of state, and called on them to join him in realizing “a new Amazonian dream”—a grand plan for conservation linked to sustainable development. A few months later, in Dubai for the annual climate-change conference, Lula hailed Brazil’s progress in preserving the rain forest, and celebrated its selection as the site of the 2025 summit.</p><p>But, for all Lula’s talk about a green future, the large-scale operations in Roraima lasted only a few months. The armed forces, which had joined last year’s initiative only reluctantly, ceased coöperating. It wasn’t even clear how much loyalty the new President could expect from the military, a largely conservative body that ran the country as a dictatorship from 1964 to 1985. After the inauguration, Bolsonaro partisans had launched a chaotic assault on the Presidential palace, Congress, and the Supreme Court, and some police and members of the military had assisted the mob. Lula subsequently pushed out the commanders of the Army and of the police force that guards the capital. But the military is still regarded as hostile to Lula—not to mention to the idea of Indigenous rights.</p><p>When I visited Roraima, authorities there said that <em>garimpeiros</em> had been returning to Yanomami territory. Some politicians were not only tacitly accommodating the miners but in some cases coöperating with them. For many people in Brazil, the lure of easy money far outweighed environmental concerns. Even the judge who had tried to force Bolsonaro to intervene in the Amazon, Luís Roberto Barroso, acknowledged the persistence of the problem. “There is an inescapable reality,” he told me, “which is that you have people living in poverty sitting on top of vast wealth.”</p><p>Boa Vista is a low-slung city of half a million people, spread along the banks of the Rio Branco. Although Brazil has a complex web of laws to protect the wilderness, settler communities inevitably find ways to profit from the minerals and the timber found in the rain forest, and Boa Vista is booming. Newly built avenues are lined with ostentatious villas, restaurants, and boutiques. Downtown, a children’s water park has been constructed next to an artificial beach, decorated with huge, colorfully painted statues of anacondas, jaguars, anteaters, and crocodiles. Near the government offices, a modernist stone sculpture depicts a prospector panning for gold.</p><p>Local officials leave little doubt about their support for mining. In 2022, the Roraima state legislature enacted a law that prohibited destroying equipment confiscated from illegal miners within its jurisdiction. Outside the office of the governor, a Bolsonaro ally named Antonio Denarium, miners and ranchers gathered to celebrate with a barbecue and concert, under a banner that read “Garimpo Is Legal.” (Last year, after Lula took office, Brazil’s Supreme Court threw out the law.)</p><p>Cognizant of the local attitudes, the G.E.F. keeps its presence in Boa Vista quiet. When I’d arrived, I was told to check into a hotel and wait. Nearly a week later, I got a call telling me that an unmarked car would take me to meet the team at one of the helicopter launchpads that it uses in town: a walled-in grassy patch at the regional headquarters of the federal police. Around the wall were rusting carcasses of helicopters and airplanes confiscated from miners on previous raids. A couple of years before, an angry group had protested the seizures by attempting to set a government helicopter on fire.</p><p>The G.E.F. helicopters took us past the edge of Boa Vista, where vast, treeless cattle ranches and soy farms stretch into the distance. In thirty minutes of flying at a hundred and twenty miles an hour, we could see the open plains start to give way to forest, until my chopper landed at a site where the paved road turns to red-dirt track. It was the team’s refuelling point before seeking out mines in Yanomami territory. Near a farmhouse, a shiny steel tanker was parked by a mango tree. The truck drove several hours from Boa Vista each morning with an armed escort.</p><p>During the raids last spring, the G.E.F. had been able to refuel in a Yanomami community where the military maintained an outpost. But, a few weeks before my visit, the Air Force had suddenly removed the fuel tank, offering no explanation. The arrangement at the farm was provisional and seemed unlikely to last. One of the agents providing security told me that men in a pickup truck had pulled up early that morning, taken pictures of the tanker and its guards, and then driven away.</p><p>Within a few minutes of taking off again, we had entered Yanomami territory: a rolling green blanket, punctuated only occasionally by the bright-yellow flowers of an ipê tree. Deep in the forest, we set down at a gouged mining area. In a camp under the trees, we found a cook fire still burning. The miners clearly weren’t far away.</p><p>The G.E.F. members started to burn the camp, monitoring the flames to make sure that they didn’t spread. While the men worked, Finger quietly headed into the forest, like a hunting dog that had picked up a scent. Fifteen minutes later, he reappeared with a woman in tow. He explained that he’d found underwear drying on a clothesline and a stack of warm pancakes in the mess, and he figured the camp’s cook must be nearby. He’d found her hiding in some bushes. She was in her fifties, wearing a pink dress and carrying a bag stuffed with belongings. She looked frightened.</p><p>Speaking in breathy bursts, she told Cabral and Finger that her name was Margarida. She was a widow, and after her husband’s death she had struggled to pay rent and buy food. She had arrived at the mine two days before, after a long river journey, she said, and she didn’t know anything about its operation—not even what the miners’ names were. Cabral, looking skeptical, asked what her salary was. She gave a figure that amounted to about four hundred dollars a month. It was a suspiciously small amount, but the cooks, invariably women, were the worst-paid employees of the mines; younger cooks earned extra money as sex workers or were coerced into prostitution.</p><p>No one could say precisely how many miners had made their way back into the territory after last year’s raids, or had never left, but one government ministry recently estimated the number at about seven thousand. Many of the people who worked the mines were impoverished locals looking for any job they could find; others made a career of it. At one camp, we’d come across the résumé of a thirty-seven-year-old named José, who had been a sales assistant at an auto-parts shop in Boa Vista, then moved to the city of Manaus to work in a shoe store. His legal employment history ended in 2016, which presumably was when he had turned to illegal mining. Finger drew a distinction between people like Margarida and those like José. “These simpler people, a hundred per cent are there for financial gains,” he said. “But many of the miners are in this for a better life style. If he can make five thousand reais per week mining, why would he stay in the city earning a thousand or less?”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Indigenous people who got involved in mining had more complex incentives. Many were motivated by fear, some by necessity, others by the lure of consumer goods that miners offered, including liquor, shotguns, and new iPhones. “If an Indigenous person was co-opted by a criminal, either simply to turn a blind eye or to directly participate, it’s a sign that the state failed,” Finger argued. “The state is not present, and the criminals managed to occupy this gap. And some Indigenous people, without another way to carry on their lives there, end up getting involved.”</p><p>The G.E.F. team sometimes showed concern for the miners; when they found prescription medicine during a raid, they threw it clear of the burn zone so that its owner could retrieve it. But, when I asked Cabral if we were going to fly the cook out with us, he shook his head. “She got herself here,” he said. “She can get herself out.” He reassured me that most of the miners attached to the camp were hiding in the forest and would surely emerge as soon as we left. With their food stores destroyed, they would have to evacuate the jungle, and would make the journey together.</p><p>Heading back to the choppers, Finger was frustrated. This mine had been destroyed not long before. “They were quiet for a couple of months,” he said. “But when they saw that the operations had decreased they came back, and they’ve learned how to adapt to our tactics.” He pointed to a wide trail leading from the mine into the forest. It was a track for A.T.V.s, built under tree cover to thwart detection from the sky. On his G.P.S., Finger measured our distance from the <em>isolados</em>. “Less than thirty miles,” he said. “It’s very close, considering the range some Yanomami need for hunting.”</p><p>For four decades, the Amazon has existed in a state of persistent conflict—protected by federal law but threatened by the people who live there. On the way to Boa Vista, I’d had lunch in Brasília with Sydney Possuelo, who had seen much of this history at first hand. Possuelo is a legendary <em>sertanista</em>—one of the jungle scouts who made the first contacts with isolated people. He started travelling into the Amazon six decades ago. Since then, he has hiked thousands of miles through unexplored jungle, been shot by arrows, and made first contact with seven Indigenous groups. Now eighty-three, he occupies a position in the Brazilian consciousness somewhere between Buffalo Bill and John Muir.</p><p>We met at an open-air restaurant and sat outside, at his request, until a tropical downpour forced us indoors. We were joined by Rubens Valente, the author of “The Rifles and the Arrows,” an authoritative book on Indigenous resistance movements. A soft-spoken man of fifty-four, Valente is one of a very few Brazilian journalists who have made a career of reporting on the Amazon and its Indigenous inhabitants. This media inattention is symptomatic of a larger national neglect, which is partly a result of geography. The rain forest makes up seventy-eight per cent of Brazil’s landmass but contains less than fifteen per cent of its population. For Brazilians who live outside the Amazon, it can seem as remote and exotic as it does to Americans.</p><p>As a young man, Possuelo worked for <em>FUNAI</em>, Brazil’s agency for Indigenous affairs. In those days, the Indigenous were thought of as “wild Indians,” and Possuelo’s job was to initiate contact in order to “tame” them; the military government planned to open the “green hell” of the Amazon to development by building a highway through it.</p><p>By the early nineteen-eighties, Possuelo had begun to understand that exposure to the outside world was largely disastrous for Indigenous groups. Many succumbed to disease; others suffered from alcoholism and sexual exploitation, their forests targeted by unscrupulous loggers and miners. Some chiefs sold access to their lands and began to make profits of their own.</p><p>In 1987, after the fall of Brazil’s dictatorship, Possuelo created a department at <em>FUNAI</em> that organized expeditions to confirm the presence of <em>isolados</em>, to legally protect their territories—but he insisted they be left alone unless they initiated contact. “The true importance of the <em>isolados</em> isn’t in their numbers,” Possuelo told me. “It’s in their languages and cultures and societies, about which we know little, and that has to be respected.” A new constitution, instituted the following year, contained provisions to protect Indigenous lands. Soon afterward, Possuelo led the demarcation of the vast Yanomami territory, a chunk of jungle that spans almost twenty-four million acres—an area larger than Portugal—along the border with Venezuela.</p><figure><p><span><div data-attr-viewport-monitor=""><a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a26800&quot;}" href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a26800" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><picture></picture></a><p><span>“I’m not great at this whole networking thing.”</span></p><p><span>Cartoon by Johnny DiNapoli</span></p></div></span></p></figure><p>In those days, the Yanomami were one of Brazil’s most secluded Indigenous groups; regular contact with the outside world had begun barely two decades before. Today, about thirty thousand Yanomami live in the Brazilian Amazon. Spread out in some three hundred communities, they live much as they always have, in <em>malocas</em> that house communal groups of several dozen families. They hunt, fish, and gather fruit in the forest, and also grow a few crops—plantains, cassava, maize—for their sustenance.</p><p>The gold in Yanomami rivers has been a problem for as long as outsiders have made their way into the jungle. Possuelo said that, in the early nineties, there were perhaps forty thousand miners operating there, but that he and his allies had forced most of them out. It was harder now, though. The Indigenous were more involved in the trade, and the miners were better equipped and more organized. Perhaps most important, he said, the military wasn’t helping to protect the Yanomami. The armed forces maintained three bases in the territory, but, he said, it had not deployed soldiers to stop river traffic, or consistently used aerial surveillance to prevent the miners from coming in. The military had opposed the creation of the Yanomami territory from the beginning, Possuelo explained; when he was marking its borders, the commander of the Army accused him of advancing an independent “Yanomami empire,” stretching across the border with Venezuela. Possuelo laughed as he recalled news stories that the military had orchestrated to spread the conspiracy theory.</p><p>Valente said that the armed forces’ view of the Amazon hadn’t changed: “The military fundamentally doesn’t believe in conservation. They think the development of the wilderness is necessary and see it as inevitable.” He showed me a book titled “The Yanomami Farce,” released in 1995 by the Army’s publishing house. The cover depicts a blond, fair-skinned man holding up a mask with the face of a Yanomami man in a feather headdress. The book, written by an Army colonel, argued that the Yanomami were not a real Indigenous community but the invention of an international cabal that intended to take over the Amazon. Bolsonaro promoted the same idea, accusing Greenpeace and environmentalist celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio of being part of this nefarious master plan.</p><p>Yet Possuelo was also skeptical of the current government’s campaign, pointing out that Lula had acted after a Supreme Court judge ordered the government to remove the miners. “The fact is that the Brazilian state has never liked the Indians,” he said. “The left doesn’t like the Indians, and the right doesn’t&nbsp;like the Indians, and the center doesn’t like the Indians, either.”</p><p>One afternoon, as we approached a mine from the air, a crew of panicked miners went running into the forest. One of them fell over a log, scrambled to his feet, and took off again. As I followed their progress, something caught my eye: two dazzling macaws, flying away from the commotion. After we landed, I found macaw feathers, yellow and blue, hanging on a string from a pole in the camp. Cabral shook his head and said that the <em>garimpeiros</em> must have hunted and eaten the bird. “The animals die a silent death,” he said mournfully.</p><p>For a public servant, Cabral is unusually outspoken—at least on Instagram, where his account is devoted to denouncing animal cruelty. In one recent post, he shared a photograph of someone’s pet parrot, with green feathers tinged yellow. “This is mistreatment,” he wrote. “The yellow pigmentation indicates nutritional deficiency. A trained environmental agent would notice and fine the person responsible.”</p><p>At the camp, Finger told Cabral that he had found signs of an active site deeper in the forest. We followed him, moving silently along a path through the woods. As we advanced, we could hear a dog barking. Finger scouted ahead, then crept back and motioned for us to follow. In a clearing, there was a wooden shack and a cookhouse, abandoned except for a black dog with distended teats, yowling in distress. Then we heard a peculiar squalling from a box next to the shack. Cabral lifted a plastic cover, revealing a mass of wriggling puppies, just a few days old. He picked up a couple and held them, then walked to a rack where the miners had been drying bush meat—tapir, he guessed. He threw a piece to the mother dog, which began devouring it.</p><p>The team searched through belongings, but no one poured gas or piled up flammables. Were they going to burn the place? I asked. The men didn’t answer; they were looking at Cabral, fussing over the puppies. Eventually, Finger barked, “Let’s go.” As the team fell in, Cabral told me that they were leaving the camp intact because of the puppies: “We could move them away from the shack, but the mother might run away in fright and not be able to find them afterward.” One of the men joked that, if there had been a child in the camp instead of the puppies, they would have burned the shack. Cabral laughed and shook his head, but he didn’t protest.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Early in his career, Cabral acquired the nickname Rambo, but it seemed mostly like a joke. He had taken up armed patrols only in service of wildlife conservation, his lifelong passion. He came from Juiz de Fora, a city in Brazil’s interior, and spent his childhood immersed in nature, watching wildlife programs and reading about animals. “This is all I ever wanted to do,” he told me. He earned a degree in biology and another in ecology, then joined <em>IBAMA</em>, a branch of the environment ministry that protects threatened ecosystems.</p><p>Working in the Amazon, Cabral became increasingly aware that ecological abuses converged with other crimes: gunrunning, drug trafficking, homicides. But the Brazilian government dealt with these things through a patchwork of federal bureaucracies and police agencies, with no force that had both the requisite scientific knowledge and military-style training. In 2013, Cabral secured approval to build a unit of rangers who were committed to saving the environment, by force if necessary. The next year, he was shot in the shoulder when he and his men surprised illegal loggers in the woods; he was back at work in less than two months.</p><p>The members of the G.E.F. are biology nerds who found themselves carrying guns—a gang of jungle Ghostbusters. They undergo intensive training, developed by a specialized police unit that fights organized crime. “There are courses on weaponry and shooting, survival in operational environments, vertical activities, and aerial operations,” Finger said. “We had a tactical-entry course, but adapted to our reality—they focus mostly on urban operations, while we focus on rural areas, forest environments.” <em>IBAMA</em> has twenty-eight hundred employees, but very few apply for the training, and fewer still qualify. Out of the twenty or so who tried out most recently, Finger said, only four were accepted.</p><p>Finger had the physique and the temperament of a natural athlete. Growing up in the city of Cuiabá, in Brazil’s farm belt, he had played soccer well enough to consider a career, but ended up emulating his father, who ran the forestry-engineering department at the local university. Even working in ecology, he was drawn to action. “If I had stayed in soccer, I’d have played offense,” he said, laughing. After college, he had found his way to <em>IBAMA</em> and helped establish the G.E.F.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Most members of his team had graduate degrees in the sciences. Renato, a muscular man of thirty-four with a shaved head, had specialized in fish ecology. During raids, he did a lot of the heavy lifting, keeping up a cheerful patter as he destroyed mine equipment; other times he fixed engines. Alexandre, forty-eight and the father of two young girls, had worked in a national park and in fisheries regulation before taking the G.E.F. training course. “I’d never imagined working with weapons,” he said, but he had shown an unexpected aptitude. He was generally a guard, calmly scrutinizing the surrounding forest with a gun at his shoulder.</p><p>The only nonscientist was Marcus—a former lawyer, forty-two, tall and rangy, with an easygoing manner. At the headquarters, in Brasília, he procured weapons and ammunition for the group; in the field, he was often a guard. Growing up in the interior province of Goiás, he aspired to be a photographer for skate magazines, until his parents persuaded him to go to law school instead. Halfway through, he attended a ceremony of the União do Vegetal, a Christian sect that incorporates ayahuasca in its sacraments. “During the opening chant, I left my body,” he recalled. “I started to see the Amazon rain forest and found myself walking through it in a uniform with a team, while Indigenous people chanted behind me. That moment filled me with joy, and there I discovered the mission of my life.”</p><p>In Brasília, I met Lula in his office, a capacious room with a corner view of the city. He acknowledged that his administration had allowed the situation in Roraima to deteriorate again. “We should have done something, and we didn’t do it,” he said. Yet he seemed wary of criticizing the military, whose support he needs to remain in power. Even as he allowed that the armed forces “could have made mistakes,” he said, “I don’t think we need to single out someone responsible.” All the ministries involved had failed, he suggested: “Here in Brazil, we used to say that a dog that has too many owners will starve, because everyone thinks that the other owner gave him food.” (He also noted that the armed forces had flown nine hundred and forty missions distributing aid to the Yanomami, and that “not one dumped cargo on anyone’s head, as happened in Gaza.”)</p><figure><p><span><div data-attr-viewport-monitor=""><a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a28166-rd&quot;}" href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a28166-rd" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><picture></picture></a><p><span>Cartoon by Roz Chast</span></p></div></span></p></figure><p>Part of the problem with policing the territory was its sheer size, he said. There was also the fact that some of the miners are Venezuelans who have crossed the border, which meant that arresting them and blowing up their boats risked creating an international incident. “If we send in the military to take such actions, I could face problems,” he said.</p><p>The greatest problem, in Lula’s telling, was that Bolsonaro had left him a mess. “The state machinery was dismantled—everything that has to do with climate change, everything that has to do with Indigenous people, everything that has to do with environmental conservation,” he said. Bolsonaro had reduced <em>IBAMA</em>’s staff of rangers by sixty per cent, and had imposed similar cuts at the agencies for Indigenous affairs and the environment. The agencies that worked in the Amazon were handed to archconservative military officers. The environment ministry was given to an advocate of deregulation, who later resigned after being accused of involvement in an illicit logging scheme. (The minister denied any wrongdoing.) <em>FUNAI</em>’s Indigenous-outreach department went to an evangelical preacher who had previously sought out isolated groups to convert them. The director he replaced, Bruno Pereira, kept up his work independently. In 2022, he was murdered, along with a British reporter named Dom Phillips, while investigating illegal intrusions in the Javari valley.</p><p>During the Bolsonaro years, the G.E.F. struggled with political interference, and for one eight-month stretch was confined to base. Now it had the government’s public blessing, but it still didn’t have the support it needed. There were vexing limitations on making arrests. “If we catch someone in the act of committing a crime, we can arrest the criminal and take them to the federal police,” Finger said. But Brazilian law made it nearly impossible to imprison mine workers, so the G.E.F. detained only those who had what Finger called “relevant strategic interest”—people higher in the command structure, who are rarely in the field. “If it’s just a worker at the mining site, we identify them but usually leave them there.”</p><p>The miners were brazenly aware of the G.E.F.’s limits. On one raid, we flew over a camp on a forested hill, where a man stood blithely watching as we circled. Cabral explained that he had probably deduced, correctly, that there was nowhere for us to land the helicopters. Technology provided another kind of cover. “Wherever the miners have Starlink, we’re at a real disadvantage,” Finger told me. “They can warn each other there is a raid going on in the territory, and they can organize their work better.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Some members of the G.E.F. felt increasingly that Lula’s administration was doing only what was necessary to preserve its image. “There are few people in this government who really care about the conservation of the wilderness,” one told me. “Lula is not really an environmentalist himself—it’s more that he’s worried about international public opinion.” Cabral lamented that, even aside from the Yanomami crisis, obvious solutions to environmental problems were being ignored. If sawmills were properly licensed and monitored, for example, it would hugely reduce illegal logging.</p><p>Of course, Cabral said, things had improved since the previous administration. <em>IBAMA</em> was being rebuilt, and its ranks of active rangers had expanded slightly. Nevertheless, there were roughly eight hundred rangers responsible for all of Brazil’s regions, including not just the Amazon but also the Pantanal wetlands and the immense Atlantic coastline. The country needed at least five thousand more, Cabral said—yet the salaries were paltry, with the most experienced rangers earning no more than a rookie in the federal police. Cabral himself made about twenty-five hundred dollars a month. Even so, he wouldn’t change jobs, he said: “I love what I do.” But others were losing patience; not long after my visit, employees at <em>IBAMA</em> and other environmental agencies began to protest by refusing to go on field operations.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Cabral told me how many members the G.E.F. had only after swearing me to secrecy. It was a shockingly low number. Finger, who was listening in, explained, “It’s hard to find people who want this kind of life. People want to go to a desk and work for some hours and then go home.” I asked Cabral how much bigger the team would need to be in order to flush the miners from Yanomami territory. “With thirty-six men, I could do two operations simultaneously, which would be ideal,” he replied. It would still be a small team, but with the right kind of backup, he said, it could achieve a lot. To address all of the mining hot spots around the Amazon, he guessed, the G.E.F. would need at least three hundred and twenty men—many times what he had.</p><p>As we walked through the forest on raids, we were shaded by huge trees, and when we emerged into the cleared spaces around mines there was a sudden shock of heat. The signs of extraction were always the same: gouged earth, trees felled and burned, the forest floor stripped to bare soil. The camps were usually crude: stick palisades, covered in black or blue tarps, and open-sided cookhouses littered with charred pots and cans of sardines. On one mess table, I saw a Bible, an acetylene torch with a bottle of mercury, and a supply ledger listing aspirin, ointment for sores, and stomach medication. On another, I saw shotgun cartridges and a pair of black assault rifles. There was often the smell of food being cooked and eaten in close range of stagnant water and places where people shit.</p><p>At one mine, Finger led the column up an A.T.V. trail that stretched into the forest, and as we left camp the light grew dimmer and the trill of cicadas swelled. A few hundred feet along the path, two shots cracked through the trees. We all threw ourselves on the ground and waited tensely, until word came down the line that it was Finger who had fired. When we caught up with him, he was still scanning the woods with his weapon ready. He had spotted a man with a gun and had fired before his opponent could. The man had fled, apparently unharmed.</p><p>In some ways, the sweeps that Lula ordered last year had only increased the danger for Finger and his men. Most of the impoverished locals who worked in the mines had fled, and many of those who had taken their place were better armed and better funded—often because they were linked to criminal groups. The most fearsome was a São Paulo-based crime syndicate known as the P.C.C., from a Portuguese phrase meaning “First Command of the Capital.” The P.C.C., founded in a prison annex known as Big Piranha, had grown into Brazil’s largest criminal enterprise, with connections to the Calabrian Mob and a significant presence in the global cocaine trade. Gold prospecting offered the gang both revenue and opportunities to launder drug money.</p><p>Early in 2023, the G.E.F. had arrived in Roraima and started collecting intelligence. “In three uninterrupted months acting daily on the ground, we were able to gather a lot of precise information about how the P.C.C. was operating,” Finger said. The gang supplied miners with equipment and guns, and also sent its members to supervise and provide security. I saw one video, taken by a terrified, whispering Yanomami man, of heavily armed men hiking up a ravaged riverbed as he hid in the bushes a few feet away. Gang members helped transport gold out of the territory, and in settlements they sold drugs and ran prostitution rings.</p><p>On April 30th, G.E.F. members joined a group of federal highway police to raid an encampment occupied by the P.C.C. “The operation took place during the day, on a Sunday,” an agent who was involved told me. “It was by helicopter—the only way to reach the area surgically.” A river incursion would have been risky: the miners knew the terrain better.</p><p>The helicopters that <em>ibama</em> supplied for the mission weren’t bulletproof, so they dropped the men and left as quickly as they could—“a very quick infiltration to avoid being hit.” As the patrol moved through the jungle, gunfire came from off the trail several times. “We knew that the risk of an armed confrontation was real,” the agent said. “We had prepared for it, planned for it.” Nevertheless, the first burst of gunfire was jarring: “I thought to myself, We have to apply the techniques we’ve learned and come back alive. We have our families to take care of.” In training courses, he said, “there is a bell that you ring when you give up. In the middle of the war, there is no bell.”</p><p>When the shooting stopped, the government agents were safe and four criminals had been killed. Among them was Sandro Moraes de Carvalho—a gangster known as Presidente, the P.C.C.’s commander in the area. The firefight made national news, drawing attention to the Amazon, and Brazil’s minister of justice announced that he was sending in more than two hundred armed officers. “It was the most important action in the history of the G.E.F.,” Finger told me.</p><p>Finger avoided discussing his more dangerous missions with his wife. “I don’t know if she doesn’t ask to avoid knowing the details, for psychological reasons—but she doesn’t ask, and I don’t tell,” he said. “If my mother knew, she wouldn’t sleep.” But he showed few reservations about the use of force. “The idea that criminal groups can take over territory and hold Indigenous people hostage is more than a humanitarian emergency—it is a war,” he said. “Indigenous people are just like us, and maybe better than us. But their lives are being destroyed. The state needs to come in and protect them and treat them like Brazilians.”</p><p>The Yanomami do not have a single leader, but Davi Kopenawa, a shaman in his late sixties, is widely acknowledged as their representative to the outside world. Kopenawa, who is sometimes referred to as “the Dalai Lama of the jungle,” maintains a home in the forest, but he spends much of his time in Boa Vista, spreading awareness of his people’s concerns from the offices of the Hutukara Yanomami Association.</p><p>One morning, I visited the association’s compound, which overlooked the Rio Branco and was secured with surveillance cameras and a wall topped with electrified razor wire. Past the gate, I found Kopenawa inspecting a small strip of garden that ran between the security wall and the house, which was painted an institutional gray. Barefoot, in shorts and a T-shirt, Kopenawa had wooden plugs in his earlobes and a stick in his hand. He stood scowling at a line of small bushes that had recently been planted next to the wall. In halting Portuguese, he grumbled, “This isn’t a real garden. It’s the kind of thing white people plant to say they like plants.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Inside, his office walls were hung with photographs of the Yanomami, taken by some of the earliest visitors: a vision of life before the incursion of outsiders. Kopenawa perched in a chair and toyed with a macaw feather on his desk as we talked. I asked if he had thought of going with Lula to the climate conference in Dubai. Kopenawa waved his stick and grimaced. “That’s just for white people.” He liked Lula, he said, but Lula did not grasp the full extent of what was happening in Yanomami territory. He hadn’t even been there—only to Boa Vista, he said chidingly—and little had changed since he had declared the health emergency. In one place, Kopenawa said, the miners had built a road right into their land. In another, they had surrounded a community, razing its forest; now some Yanomami there were working for the miners and had become addicted to drugs.</p><p>Kopenawa suggested that the military was being duplicitous. “They just come to make it appear as if everything is all right,” he said. “But they’re not taking out the miners—they’re supporting them.” He asked me to pass a message to the President: “Tell Lula that the problems of the Yanomami people have not been resolved, that illegal mining continues, that I am worried about our children. Tell him that criminals with guns have joined the miners—and the police are afraid to go there.” He added, “Lula has been travelling a lot all over the world. But he should come here, to our land, which has been invaded. We need his help, too.”</p><p>The local authorities were worse, Kopenawa said: “They don’t like or respect us. All they want is to exploit our land and to rob our forest.” He had received death threats, which is why his security wall had been reinforced. The house next door to the association’s belonged to an influential senator named Chico Rodrigues, who, like the state’s governor, was a Bolsonaro ally. Rodrigues had made news in 2020, when federal police raided his house as part of an investigation into the embezzlement of <em>COVID</em>-19 relief funds. Agents searched him and found more than five thousand dollars’ worth of Brazilian cash hidden in his underwear and his clothes. Rodrigues had previously been fined for illegally razing more than fifteen hundred acres of rain forest and converting it into cattle range, but he never paid. (He has maintained his innocence on both counts.)</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Back on the street, as I got into a car, a mud-spattered pickup pulled in front of me. A group of rough-looking young men got out and buzzed at the security door of Rodrigues’s house, an imposing white multilevel place that loomed over the association’s compound. As they were shown in, a Yanomami man in the car with me whispered, “<em>Garimpo</em>.”</p><p>When I met with Lula, he told me that he hoped to return to Roraima. “It’s important to go there again,” he said, adding, “We have a human obligation to solve this issue.” Despite the increasing problems in the region, he spoke energetically of his plans. His administration recently passed an emergency measure that allocated more than two hundred million dollars to efforts in the Yanomami territory. “We’re going to hire more federal police,” he said. “We’re going to hire more armed forces.” In order to facilitate a more coherent response, his administration had set up a multi-agency “coördinating center” in Boa Vista, run by one of his close loyalists; it opened in mid-March. “Six months from now, you come back to Brazil and we’ll have another conversation,” Lula assured me.</p><p>Marina Silva, Lula’s environment minister, suggested that the concerns would be difficult to address. When I visited her office, she was preparing for the latest climate-change summit, where she would appear alongside Lula. She looked exhausted. Silva, the daughter of an Amazonian rubber tapper, is a bespectacled woman with an ethereal presence who has spent decades leading efforts to safeguard Brazil’s wilderness. She served as Lula’s environment minister during his first tenure, and although she succeeded in fighting deforestation, differences emerged between them over a series of infrastructure projects, which included a huge hydroelectric dam and a major road in the rain forest. She finally resigned, citing “growing resistance by important sectors of the government and society.” Still, after the calamitous Bolsonaro Presidency, she had agreed to rejoin Lula, in the hope of repairing the damage.</p><p>In her office, Silva chose her words carefully, saying, “There have been some advances and also challenges.” Lula’s first advance, obviously, was the “reëstablishment of democracy.” Immediately after taking office, she pointed out, he had signed five decrees to protect the environment. Yet his administration had also auctioned off oil- and gas-drilling rights in nearly two hundred areas; there is talk that Lula may authorize the paving of a five-hundred-mile-long road through the rain forest.</p><p>A large portion of Brazil’s exports rely on farming and natural-resource extraction, and implementing a policy of “zero deforestation” would require rebuilding the economy. Silva acknowledged that there was “no magic key” to changing a development model that was three hundred years old. “It will require pressure, sustained policies, and also sustained investment,” she said. Unless the government found ways to provide economic solutions for its citizens, its plans would be doomed, she suggested. The only way forward was to be “sustainable,” and to “create an environmental consciousness among Brazilians.” She was talking, in effect, about a revolutionary change in the way her country’s citizens imagined their lives.</p><p>On the morning of our last raid, the rain in the jungle was too heavy to fly in, so we had to wait out the storm at a new refuelling point—a farm farther into the forest. The last place had fallen through; the owner, under pressure from his <em>garimpo</em> neighbors, had told the team to refuel elsewhere. The new farm had a Starlink connection, and, as the rains abated, a pilot said that he was sure the farm manager would warn the miners that we were coming.</p><p>He was right: at the first target site, the <em>garimpeiros</em> were speeding away on A.T.V.s by the time we approached. We found a string of mines, connected by trails, with two airstrips carved out of the forest. A stretch of riverbank perhaps two miles long had been smashed and ruined. Marcus, the former lawyer, said that G.E.F. members often told themselves, “We won’t end the degradation of the Amazon—we will only postpone the end of the Amazon.” As we hiked around one of the mine pits, he&nbsp;confessed that he feared that “the Yanomami jungle would become like Rio, all of it in the hands of criminal organizations.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>On our flight back, my pilot, Franke, found a radio frequency where <em>garimpo</em> pilots were talking. As we listened, one gave his coördinates to another. Franke’s co-pilot traced them to an airstrip in the woods—just a few miles from the G.E.F. team’s new refuelling point. Franke passed the information to Finger, in the other helicopter, and they agreed to try to intercept the plane before it could take off.</p><p>The laws concerning intercepting planes are intricate. “I can set fire to clandestine airstrips but not shoot planes down,” Finger told me. Aircraft discovered on the ground can be destroyed or flown to Boa Vista, though there was no way of knowing that they were in good enough condition to make the trip safely. The best hope was to apprehend the people on board. “When we manage to get our hands on the pilot, we take them into custody,” Finger said.</p><p>As we approached the airstrip, the <em>garimpo</em> plane, a Cessna, quickly took off, heading farther into Yanomami territory. Finger and Franke raced after it, as the <em>garimpeiro</em> pilot took evasive action—banking hard to the left, then dropping down till his plane almost brushed the treetops.</p><p>While the Cessna sped above the forest, we chased after it, listening to its pilot shouting over the radio, “He’s on my back!” But the <em>garimpeiro</em> stayed tauntingly ahead of us; as Franke explained, our chopper’s top speed was the same as the Cessna’s. Franke watched the fuel gauge anxiously as he flew. We’d started the chase with not much more gas than we needed to get back to base, and the needle was dropping fast. Finally, Finger had to peel away, and soon afterward so did we. As we watched, the plane flew on into the jungle.</p><p>Despite these kinds of frustrations, the G.E.F. team maintained a stubborn resolve. Alexandre, the fisheries expert, told me, “In the remote areas where we work, our efforts have consequences—we manage to halt encroachment. Even if it’s a little ant’s work, it’s possible to see the progress.” But Finger described their efforts as a zero-sum game. As the G.E.F. chased out miners from Roraima, others were encroaching on Kayapó territory, and on protected Munduruku land. An Indigenous settlement called Sararé, on the Bolivian border, was increasingly worrisome. “The feeling of fighting a losing battle is constant,” Finger said.</p><p>On one raid, Franke slowed the rotors and pulled into a wide circle over the forest, gesturing for me to look out the window. Below us was a clearing, with a circle of lean-tos at the center. According to Franke’s G.P.S., it was the same <em>maloca</em> the miners had flown over two weeks earlier, terrifying the <em>isolados</em> in the TikTok video. There was no sign of life now; the <em>maloca</em> appeared abandoned.</p><p>As we flew away, Franke pointed down again. I could see a river, its muddy banks gouged and punched, with shining pools of stagnant water—the signs of a mining operation. I asked him how far we were from the <em>maloca</em>. “One point seven kilometres,” he said. The mine was deserted, and the miners were gone, for now. But so, it seemed, were the Yanomami.&nbsp;♦</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <p>AUSTIN, Texas — A new study by an interdisciplinary team of researchers at The University of Texas at Austin provides the most reliable validation to date of the connection between physical activity, sleep quality and psychological health.</p>
<p>The study found that physical activity lengthened REM latency — that is, the time it takes to enter the REM stage. This may indicate that exercise helps consolidate deeper sleep stages before transitioning into REM sleep, which is when we tend to have vivid dreams and our brains seem to be as active as they are when we’re awake.</p>
<p>Scientific studies backed by anecdotal evidence already testify to the fact that when we exercise regularly, we sleep better. And, when we sleep better, we feel better. Although there is ample scientific evidence to support this, until now the studies have been conducted in lab settings, with conclusions drawn from observing experiences after just one night’s sleep.&nbsp;Such limited methodologies are problematic for any scientific study, regardless of how widely accepted the findings may be.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-56332-7">study</a>, published in Nature Scientific Reports<em>, </em>investigated how daily physical activity patterns affect sleep stages and emotional well-being in a natural environment — at home, at work and during daily activities — over several months.</p>
<p>The research team used advanced wearable technology to track sleep and activity levels in 82 young adults. A wrist-worn activity tracker recorded both movement and heart rate. From those signals, periods of deep (NREM) sleep&nbsp;and REM sleep, along with physical activity, could be determined. A separate smartphone app was used to collect self-reported well-being data.</p>
<p>The study emerged from a pilot study conducted as part of <a href="https://bridgingbarriers.utexas.edu/whole-communities-whole-health">Whole Communities–Whole Health</a>, a grand challenge research program that takes an interdisciplinary approach to how health care data are collected while also engaging communities and participants in the research process. This more wide-reaching study successfully replicated many of the findings previously conducted in sleep labs: namely, that engaging in both low-intensity and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was linked to deeper, more restorative sleep, and that better sleep was in turn associated with more energy and less stress the following morning.</p>
<p>The key difference this time was the researchers’ innovative use of wearable technology, which allowed for continuous monitoring of participants’ behaviors, providing a comprehensive picture of daily activities and their impact on sleep and mood over multiple weeks, even months.</p>
<p>“You can learn a lot from lab studies, but obviously there are limitations to studying the sleep patterns of individual participants in just one night,” said <a href="https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/psychology/faculty/bsb57">Benjamin Baird</a>, a research assistant professor of psychology and one of the authors of the study. “It’s an unfamiliar, clinical-type setting, which can be stressful. And you can’t really look over time, either. So, there are always questions about generalizability from that kind of design.”</p>
<p>Baird said that researchers were able to address for the first time how these differences in sleep architecture are associated with people’s perceived well-being. Sleep architecture refers to the structure of each 90- to 120-minute-long sleep cycle: the three stages of non-REM sleep (light, deep and deepest NREM sleep) and REM sleep, which makes up the final 25% or so of each cycle.</p>
<p>“We’ve shown using a standard Fitbit that anyone could wear — not even an expensive scientific device — that it is actually sensitive to these sorts of sleep architecture measures, and in a way that’s showing predictive results,” said <a href="https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/psychology/faculty/dms2529">David M. Schnyer</a>, a co-author and chair of the Department of Psychology. “The world is your oyster now. You can use this device to study all manner of different sleep architecture data related to lifestyle — related to mood and mood disorders — in the field, not in a lab, that people might have thought was not possible previously.”</p>

The technology seemed incredible, but there were some stumbles. It often took hours for customers to receive receipts after leaving the store, largely because offshore cashiers were rewatching videos and assigning items to different customers. The system of scanners and video cameras in each store is also incredibly expensive.</p><p>According to The Information, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theinformation.com/articles/how-amazons-big-bet-on-just-walk-out-stumbled?rc=5xvgzc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/how-amazons-big-bet-on-just-walk-out-stumbled?rc=5xvgzc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">700 out of 1,000 Just Walk Out sales required human reviewers as of 2022</a></span>.

</p><p><span size="+1"><b>Introduction:</b></span>

</p><p>I started writing this rather long page for my own benefit, when I acquired a upgrade from my old 2006 Win 8 250 gb HDD PC to a Dell Optiflex 3010 with a 128 gb SSD. I never used more than 30 or 40 gb of the system drive, and I'm not a gamer or an avid film or music collector either. Not on a PC anyway. As I played with my new kit the further I went I realised that I knew very little about NAND flash in SSDs, just how SSDs work, how do they read and write and store data, and what sort of trickery do they employ? I can visualise an HDD, writing tiny magnetic patterns on a rotating surface, but SSDs are different, vastly different.

</p><p>There's also quite a few misconceptions about SSDs which seem persistent, and it would be nice to examine them if not perhaps quash a few of them. Perhaps I was guilty of harbouring quite a few misconceptions myself. However it started, this article grew into, shall we say, a mid-level technical discussion. If all you need to know is that SSDs are quiet, reliable, fast, and will work for years, then there's no need to read any further. If however, you think that knowing how to read a 3D TLC NAND flash cell is interesting, then you have little option but to plough on.

</p><p>As much of the detailed information as possible has been sourced from corporate and private technical articles, with quite a lot from Seagate and WD, and the wonderfully named Flash Memory Summit. Some of the conclusions I've made are from just trying to apply what logic I can along with common sense. Such is the complexity of NAND flash controllers, the variance in their methods of operation, and the speed of their development, that trying to comprehend let alone keep up with them is difficult to say the least. I can't say whether what I've written isn't confusing or is even true, but it's more of a guide than a bible. There'll be some repetition too. And it will soon be out of date. 

</p><p>I am obliged to those I have borrowed from, and will also be obliged to those who point out any errors without any reward apart from that of contribution. I've tried to explain what is different with SSDs, and why it is so hard to grasp with our ingrained HDD minds.

</p><p>The first misconception might be the plural of SSD: gramatically it should be, so I'm told, SSDs, but SSD's is almost as commonplace. Here I will stick to one SSD, many SSDs.

</p><p><b>Software and hardware:</b>

</p><p>This article was written in 2019 onwards and deals almost exclusively with NAND flash in the form of pc or laptop storage devices we know as SSDs. I shan't complicate things even more by referring to the ubiquitous flash drive or other NAND flash devices. If significant differences exist I shall try to note them as and when that occurs, but the default is the internal drive. Nowhere here is there anything about flash storage in phones, etc.

</p><p>Most of the detail was produced whilst my PC was running Windows 10 Home, with a fairly modest internal 2.5" WD Green 120 gb SSD. This uses a Silicon Motion SM2258XT controller and four 32 GiB SanDisk 05497 032G 15nm 3D TLC memory chips with an inbuilt SLC cache of unknown capacity. As this article tries to discuss the behaviour of SSDs as a whole it shouldn't matter what host operating or file system is used, but in my case it's Windows and NTFS. Nothing here is specific to a particular brand or type of SSD, it should all be generic. We're really dealing with the principles of SSD operation.

</p><p>The only additional software applications I have used are Piriform's excellent Recuva, which can list both live and deleted files and their cluster allocations, and HexDen (HxD), a very usable and capable hex editor. Recuva is free from www.piriform.com, and HexDen is also free from www.mh-nexus.de. I use the portable versions of both pieces of software.

</p><p>All the conclusions and opinions here are entirely my own work, and any data taken from my own pc. It would be wise to verify, or at least agree with my reasoning, before accepting these words as the truth. Much of this is a simplified explanation of a very complex subject.

</p><p><b>SSD Physical Internals:</b>

</p><p>Poking inside an SSD is something of a disappointment, a small pc board with a few NAND flash chips and a controller chip, lightweight and a little flimsy. As for the software inside the controller, I can only summarise the basic tasks. It seems commonplace that controllers are bought in from external manufacturers, as indeed are the memory chips. SSD controller software is proprietary, very complex and highly guarded, but all controllers have to do basic tasks, even if we don't quite know how. Only those tasks can be discussed here, the very clever tweaks and tricks will have to remain known only to the manufacturer. I'll start with a little groundwork.

</p><p><b>NAND Flash:</b>

</p><p>I wasn't going to delve into the internals of NAND flash, there are enough frankly bemusing articles on Wikipedia for all that. All you really need to know is that NAND (NOT-AND) flash memory stores information in arrays of cells made from floating-gate transistors. The floating gate can either have no charge of electrons, and be in an 'empty' logical state, or be charged with electrons at various voltage thresholds and be in a logical state which represents a value. NAND flash is non-volatile and retains its state even when the SSD is not powered up. Oh yes, it's called flash because a large chunk of cells can be erased (flashed) at a time.

</p><p>But if you want to know more, go ahead. Here the term cell and transistor refer to the same physical entity and are used interchangeably, and I won't keep saying NAND all the time.

</p><p>Flash memory comprises multiple two-dimensional arrays of transistors, and supports three basic operations, read, program (write) and erase. Apart from the flash arrays, the flash chip includes command and status registers, a control unit, decoders, analogue circuits, buffers, and address and data buses. A separate chip holding the SSD controller sends read, program, or erase commands to the flash chip. In a read operation the controller passes the physical address to the flash chip which locates the data and sends it back to the controller. in a program operation the data and physical address are passed to the chip. In an erase operation, only the physical address is passed to the chip.

</p><p>The ﬂash chip's latches store data transferred to and from the flash arrays, and the sense ampliﬁers detect bit line voltages during read operations. The controller monitors the command sent to the chip using the status register. The controller also includes Error Checking and Correction (EEC) algorithms to manage error and reliability issues in the chip and to ensure that correct data is read or written.

</p><p>Each row of an array is connected by a Word line, and each column by a Bit line. At the intersection of a row and column is a Floating Gate Transistor, or cell, where the logical data is stored. Word lines are connected to the transistors in parallel, and bit lines in series. The ends of the bit lines are connected to sense amplifiers.

</p><p>Flash arrays are partitioned into blocks, and blocks are divided into pages. Within a block the cells connected to each word line constitute a page. The cells connected to the bit lines give the number of pages in a block. Common page sizes are 4k, 8k or 16k, with 128 to 256 pages making a block size between 512k and 4mb. A page is the smallest granularity of data that can be addressed by the chip control unit.

</p><p>Read or program operations involve the chip controller selecting the relevant block using the block decoder, then selecting a page in the block using the page decoder. The chip controller is also responsible for activating the correct analogue circuitry to generate the voltages needed for program and erase operations.

</p><p>Although the number of cells in each row is nominally equivalent to the page size, the actual number of cells in each row is higher than the stated capacity of each page. This is because each page contains a set of spare cells as well as data cells. The spare cells store the ECC bits for that page as well as the physical to logical address mapping for the page. The controller may also save additional metadata information about the page in the spare area. During a read operation, the entire page (including the bits in the spare area) is transmitted to the controller. The ECC logic in the controller checks and correct the read data. During a program operation the controller transmits both the user data and the ECC bits to the flash memory.

</p><p>Upon system boot the controller scans the spare area of each page in the entire flash array to load the logical to physical address mapping into its own memory (there may be other techiques for holding mapping data in the controller). The controller holds the logical to physical address mapping in the Flash Translation Layer (FTL). The FTL also performs garbage collection to clear invalid pages following writes, and performs wear-leveling to ensure that all the ﬂash blocks are used, evenly.

</p><p>Since flash does not support in-place updates, a page needs to be erased before its contents can be programmed; but unlike a program or a read operation which work at a page granularity, the erase operation is performed at a block granularity.

</p><p><b>2D and 3D, and Layers:</b>

</p><p>In flash architecture a block of planar flash, a two-dimensional array of cells, is rather unsurprisingly called 2D flash. If one (or more) array is stacked on top of each other then it's 3D flash. 3D NAND flash is built on one chip, up to 32 layers, and was devised to drive costs down when planar flash reached its scaling limit: 3D flash costs little more than 2D to produce, but multiplies the storage capacity immensely. In both 2D and 3D the cells in each page (the rows) are connected by Word Lines, and the cells at each offset within a page (the columns) are connected with a Bit Line (to put it very simply).

</p><p>3D flash is not the same as layered flash, where separate very thin chips are arranged in a stack. This is prohibitively expensive. Most modern consumer SSDs (in the 2010's) use 3D TLC flash.

</p><p><b>Can I see one?</b>

</p><p>The cell size on end-user flash is minute, with 15nm being common, and ranges from 43nm down to 12nm. Actually cell size, or cell diameter, is misleading, as the stated size is not a measurement of any dimension of a cell but a measure of the distance between discrete components on the chip. The silicon layers on the chip are approximately 0.5 to 3nm thick: by comparison a hydrogen atom is 0.1nm in diameter, and the silicon atoms used in chip manufacture 0.2nm. A nanometre (nm) is indeed exceedingly small, a billionth of a metre, and as an analogy if one mn were the size of a standard marble (about 13mm) then one metre would be the size of the earth. The power of a billion is impressive.

</p><p><b>SLC, MLC, TLC, QLC and Beyond:</b>

</p><p>A Single-Level Cell (SLC) has one threshold of electron charge to indicate the state of one bit, one or zero. A Multi-Level Cell (MLC) holds a voltage denoting the state of two bits, with three different thresholds representing 11, 10, 00 and 01. A Triple-Level Cell (TLC) holds the state of three bits, 111, 110, 100, 101, 001, 000, 010, and 011. The 15 thresholds used in Quad-level cells (QLC) can be deduced if anyone is at all interested. (I have seen other variations of what these threshold values represent in bit terms.)

</p><p>Unfortunately when the double level cell was developed it was called a multi-level cell and given the acronym MLC, thus forcing everyone to type out multi-level cell laboriously when they want to refer to multiple level cells. If only it had been called a double-level cell we could use DLC, TLC, and QLC freely and use MLC to describe the lot, but it's too late for that now. If only flash had stopped at SLC, with its yes/no one/zero state, these explanations would be far easier to write, and hopefully far easier to grasp.

</p><p>With multi-level cells physical NAND pages represent two or more logical pages. The two bits belonging to a MLC are separately mapped to two logical pages. Odd numbered pages (including zero) are mapped to the least significant (RH) bit, and even numbered pages are mapped to the most significant (LH) bit. Similarly, the three bits belonging to a TLC are separately mapped to three logical pages, and a QLC is mapped to four logical pages (The page numbering for TLC and QLC is unknown).

</p><p>The more bits a multi-level cell has to support affects the cell's performance. With SLC the controller only has to check if one threshold has been exceeded. With MLC the cell can have four values, with TLC eight, and QLC 16. Reading the correct value of the cell requires the SSD controller to use precise voltages and multiple reads to ascertain the charge in the cell. It's also apparent that if a single physical page supports multiple logical pages then that page will be read and written more frequently than a SLC page, with consequent affect on its life expectancy. Furthermore it would seem self-evident that a TLC SSD would need only a third of the physical cells required in an SLC device, so my 120 gb TLC SSD would actually hold only 40 gb of NAND cells. 

</p><p>High-use enterprise SSDs used to be the province of the SLC, with it's greater speed, endurance, reliability and read/write capabilities, MLC and TLC are gaining acceptance for enterprise use. The end-user consumer SSD market gets the cheaper higher capacity but slower and more fragile multiple level cells.

</p><p><b>Why is Nothing One?</b>

</p><p>Anyone still following this may have noticed a common factor in both single and multi-level cells, in that an empty cell - where the floating gate has no charge - represents one. Unlike HDDs, where any bit pattern can be written anywhere, a default logical state of ones is present on an empty SSD page. This is because there is only one programming function on the cells, to move electrons across the floating gate. NAND flash cells can only be programmed to a state of zero, there is no ability to program a one. With multi-level calls the default is still one across all pages, but a logical one can be represented even after the cell has been programmed and there are electrons present across the gate.

</p><p>Ever since Fibonacci introduced the Hindu-Arabic numeral system with its concept of zero into European mathematics in 1202, the human mind associates zero with empty and one with full. To be empty and represent one is rather perplexing, and appears to be mainly from convention (an empty state <i>could</i> represent zero but would required inverters on the data lines). Possibly the circuitry is less complex, and possibly the ability of an empty cell to conduct a charge implies that it is a one.

</p><p><b>They're all SLC anyway:</b>

</p><p>After all this it's perhaps worth emphasising that NAND flash, whatever its intended use, is all physically SLC. If you could look into a TLC cell you wouldn't see 101, or 011, or whatever. There can only ever be one quantity of electrons in a cell, no matter how that quantity is interpreted. The SSD controller knows whether the cells are to be treated as SLC, MLC etc and programs them accordingly, measures the electron count, and determines what logical value it represents. But even quad cells can only contain one value, just as do SLC cells. 

</p><p><b>The Myths and Misconceptions:</b>

</p><p>And now we come to the myths, misconceptions and the real reason for writing this article, what happens when an SSD page is read, written and rewritten, and how does this affect deleted file recovery? On one hand we have NTFS, designed specifically for HDDs way before SSDs became easily available, NAND flash with its own unique way of operating, and several billion humans with years of ingrained HDD use and expectations. And here, if I haven't already, I shall use SSD interchangeably if incorrectly for NAND flash.

</p><p><b>Storage Device Controllers:</b>

</p><p>All HDDs, SSDs and flash drives have an internal controller. It's the way that the storage device can be, in the words of Microsoft, abstracted from the host. That abstraction is done by logical block addressing, where each cluster capable of being addressed on the storage device is known to the host by an ascending number (the LBA). The storage device controller maps that number to the sectors or pages on the device. To the host this mapping is constant - a cluster remains mapped to the same LBA until the host changes it. On an HDD this relationship is physical and fixed: in its simplist deconstruction an HDD controller just reads and writes whatever sectors the host asks it to. It doesn't have to think about what was there before, it just does what it's told and writes new data on top of the old. It does that because it can, there's nothing preventing a new cluster being written directly on top of the same sectors of an old one. On an SSD it's different.

</p><p>With an SSD the host still uses the LBA addressing system with the constant reconciliation between LBA and cluster number. It knows that the device is a SSD and has a few tricks to accommodate this, but they will come later. The SSD controller however has many tricks to reconcile the host's file system, written for HDDs, with the demands of NAND flash.

</p><p><b>Flash Translation Layer:</b>

</p><p>The host still uses LBA addressing to address the SSD for read and writes, as it knows no other. These commands are intercepted by the Flash Translation Layer on the SSD controller. The FTL maintains a map of LBAs to physical block addresses, and and passes the translated PBA to the controller. This map is required because unlike an HDD the LBA to PBA relationship is volatile. It's volatile because of the way data is written to NAND flash.

</p><p>An empty page, with all cells uncharged, contains by default all ones. If a hex editor is used to look at an SSD's empty sectors however, it will be presented with clusters of zeroes. This is because empty pages are not allocated to the LBA/PBA mapping table. Instead, if a read request is issued for an empty page a default page of zeroes is returned. This applies to both unallocated clusters and those which are part of a file: the SSD does not allocate a page and change all its cells from ones to zeroes.

</p><p><b>Floating Gate Transistors:</b>

</p><p>This section might be helpful before plunging into reads and writes, and here cell and (FG)transistor become interchangable (a cell is a transistor). For more, much more, about floating gate MOSFET (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors) there is always Wikipedia.

</p><p>A FGMOS transistor has three terminals, gate, drain, and source. When a voltage is applied to the gate a current can flow from the source to the drain. Low voltages applied to the gate cause the voltage flowing from source to drain to vary proportionally to the gate voltage. At a higher voltage the proportional response stops and the gate closes regardless.

</p><p>The charge in the floating gate alters the voltage threshold of the transistor, i.e. at what point the gate will close. When the gate voltage is above a certain value, around 0.5 V, the gate will always close. When the voltage is below this value, the closing of the gate is determined by the floating gate voltage.

</p><p>If the floating gate has no charge then a low voltage applied to the gate closes the gate and allows current to flow from source to drain. If the floating gate has a charge then a higher voltage needs to be applied to the gate for it to close and current to flow. The charge in the floating gate changes how much voltage must be applied to the gate in order for it to close and conduct.

</p><p><b>SSD Reads:</b>

</p><p>There's nothing inherent in the design of NAND flash that prevents reading and writing to and from individual cells. However in line with NAND flash's design goal to be simple and small the standard commands that NAND chips accept are structured such that a page is the smallest addressable unit. This eliminates space that would be needed to hold additional instructions and cell-to-page maps.

</p><p>To read a single page, and the cells within it, the page needs to be isolated from the other pages within the block. To do this the pages not being read are temporarily disabled.

</p><p>All cells/transistors in the same block row (a page) are connected in parallel with a Word Line to the transistors' gates. All transistors in the same block column (cell offset) are chained in series with a Bit Line connecting the drain of one to the source of the next. At the end of each bit line is a sense amplifier. When a read takes place a pass-through voltage is applied to all word lines except the page being read. The pass-through voltage is close to or higher than the highest possible threshold voltage and forces the transistors <i>in all pages not being read</i> to close whether they have a stored charge or not. All bit lines are energised with a low current.

</p><p>The word line for the page being read is given a reference voltage, and all the bit line sense amplifiers read. Transistors holding a high enough electron count will not be closed by the reference voltage, and the bit line current will not pass through the source/drain chain to the sense amplifier. Transistors with no charge, or a charge below the threshold, will be closed by the reference voltage and conduct the bit line current to the sense amplifier. Several reads at varying threshold voltages are required to determine the logical state of a multi-level cell.

</p><p>(To add, or avoid, more confusion a floating gate transistor can be either open or closed. An open gate does not conduct an electrical charge, and a closed gate does. So if the gate is open nothing can get through, and if it's closed it can. No wonder we're confused.)

</p><p>It can be seen from this that to read one page in a block requires that all transistors in every page in the block receive either a pass-through or one or more reference voltages. It also appears that this will still apply even if some or all of the other pages in the block are empty. This becomes significant in Read Disturbance below.

</p><p><b>Interpreting the results:</b>

</p><p>It is quite easy to grasp the concept behind reading an SLC. Only one threshold applies to SLC flash so only one test voltage is required - the floating gate either will or will not close. if the threshold voltage closes the gate then the bit line current passes to the sense amplifier and the stored value is one. If it doesn't then it's zero.

</p><p>Multi-level cells are different, and the reasoning behind the stored value bit order becomes apparent. In a MLC the possible user bit combinations are 11, 10, 00 and 01, separated by three threshold values. To read the most significant (l/h) bit only requires one read, of the middle threshold voltage. If the gate closes then the MSB is one, if it doesn't then the MSB is zero, no matter what is in the least significant bit. To read the LSB (r/h) two reads are required, one of threshold one, and one of threshold three. If the read of threshold one closes the gate then the LSB is set to one and read two is not required. If the gate opens then a read of threshold three is taken. If it closes the LSB is set to zero. If it doesn't then the value is one.

</p><p>The bit combinations in TLC cells are 111, 110, 100, 101, 001, 000, 010, and 011, separated by seven threshold values, and are more tricky to grasp. The MSB bit again only requires one read of the middle threshold, as in MLC. The central bit requires two reads, at threshold two and six, and the LSB requires four reads, at thresholds one, three, five and seven.

</p><p>All multi-cell pages based on the MSB (l/h) are treated as SLC, with only one read required to determine the user bit value.

</p><p><b>SSD Writes:</b>

</p><p>The most significant aspect of NAND flash, the widest fork in the HDD/SSD path, and the fundamental, pivotal factor in what follows, is that data can only be written to an empty SSD page. This is not new, nor is it in any way unknown, but it has the greatest implications for data security and recovery.

</p><p>While SSDs can read and write to individual pages, they cannot overwrite pages, as the voltages required to revert a zero to a one would damage adjacent cells. All writes and rewrites need an empty page. Unlike HDDs, where a compete cluster is written to the disk whatever was there previously, the act of writing an SSD page allocates an empty page with its default of all ones, and an electrical charge is applied to the cells that require changing to zeroes. This is as true for multi-level cells as it is for SLCs, as the no-charge all-ones pattern is either replaced with a charge representing another pattern, or is left alone. This is a once-only process.

</p><p>When a write request is issued an empty page is allocated, usually within the same block, and the data written. The LBA/PBA map in the FTL is updated to allocate the new page to the relevant LBA. The LBA will always remain the same to the host: no matter which page is allocated the host will never know. This is the same process if the user data is being rewritten or if it is a new file allocation: the only difference is that the rewrite will have slightly more work to do. The old page will be flagged as invalid and will be inacessible to the host, but will still take up space within its block as it cannot be reused.

</p><p>Whilst it's easy to grasp writing to SLC pages, multi-level cell pages are more difficult to visualise. The controller accumulates new writes in the SSD cache until enough logical pages to fill a physical page are gathered, and then writes the physical page. This entails the fewest writes to the page. If a logical page in a multi-level page is amended it would require a new page to be allocated and all logical pages rewritten, as the individual values in the physical page can't be altered. If a logical page is deleted then I surmise that the deleted logical page is flagged as invalid, and when the block becomes a candidate for garbage collection any valid logical pages are consolidated before writing. In other words a multi-level page, or at least the majority of them, will always contain a full compliment of logical pages.

</p><p>It's apparent that if NAND flash handles data writes in this way - and it does - the SSD will eventually become full of valid and invalid pages, and performance will gradually slow to a crawl. Although an individual SSD page can't be erased a block can, and this method is used to return blocks to a writable state. To expedite this, and to ensure that a pool of empty blocks is always available for writes, the SSD controller uses Garbage Collection.

</p><p><b>Garbage Collection:</b>

</p><p>Garbage Collection is enabled on the humblest up to the highest capacity SSD: without it NAND flash would be unusable. Garbage Collection is part of the SSD controller and its work is unknown to the host. In its simplest form GC takes a block holding valid and invalid pages, copies the valid pages to a new empty block, updates the LBA mapping tables, and consigns the old block to the invalid block pool. There the block and its pages are reset to empty state, and the block added to the available block pool. Thus a pool of available blocks should always be available for write activity. As long as there is power to the SSD GC will do its work, it cannot be stopped. There are various sophisticated techniques for GC routines, all proprietary and mainly known only to the manufacturers.

</p><p>When an SSD arrives new from the factory writes will gradually fill the drive in a progressive, linear pattern until the addressable storage space has been entirely written. However once garbage collection begins, the method by which the data is written - sequential vs random - affects performance. Sequentially written data writes whole blocks, and when the data is replaced the whole block is marked as invalid. During garbage collection nothing needs to be moved to another block. This is the fastest possible garbage collection - i.e. no garbage to collect. When data is written randomly invalid pages are scattered throughout the SSD. When garbage collection acts on a block containing randomly written data, more data must be moved to a new block before the block can be erased.

</p><p><b>The Garbage Collection Conundrum:</b>

</p><p>Garbage Collection can either take place in the background, when the host is idle, or the foreground, as and when it is needed for a write. Whilst background GC may seem to be preferrable, it has drawbacks. If the host uses a power-saving mode when idle, GC will either wait for the device to restart with a consequent user delay for GC to complete, or wake the device up and reduce battery life whilst the host is 'idle'. Furthermore GC has no knowledge of the data it is collecting. Inevitably some data will be subject to GC and then be deleted shortly afterwards, incurring another bout of GC and consequent additional and unnecessary writes (write amplification, the ratio of actual writes to data writes). Foreground GC, seemingly the antithesis of performance, avoids the power-saving problems, only incurs writes when they are actually required, and with fast cache and highly developed GC algorithms presents no noticeable performance penalty to the user. The trend in modern GC appears to be foreground collection, or a combination of foreground and background collection.

</p><p>Based on foreground garbage collection, and that most user activity is random, then the inevitable conclusion is that the SSD will spend most of its life at full capacity, if by that we mean available blocks, even though the allocated space appears to the host to be low.

</p><p>However there is another potential problem with SSDs, and that is to do with a historical event: the way that file systems were designed.

</p><p><b>File Systems - What you see isn't what you get:</b>

</p><p>Host file systems were designed in the days when HDDs reigned supreme, simply because SSDs had yet to arrive in an available and affordable form. The file system does not take into account the needs of NAND flash. Files are constantly being updated: they get allocated, moved and deleted, and grow and shrink in size. The way the file system handles this is incompatible with the workings of NAND flash.

</p><p>It's worth emphasising that storage devices are abstracted from the host operating system. Whilst an array of folders and files are displayed by Explorer in a form wholly comprehensible to a human, it's all an illusion. What Explorer is showing is a logical construct created entirely from metadata held within the file system's tables. The storage device controller knows nothing about files or folders, or tables or operating systems: all an HDD or SDD sees are commands to read or write specific sectors, which it does faithfully. An SSD has one advantage over an HDD however, it knows that some pages hold data, and are mapped to an LBA, and some pages are empty, hold no valid data, and are not mapped to an LBA. Conversely an HDD does not need to know this, to an HDD all sectors are the same.

</p><p><b>File Deletion:</b>

</p><p>In NTFS, when a file is deleted the entry in the Master File Table is flagged as such, and the cluster bitmap is amended to flag the file's clusters as available for reuse. The delete process takes place entirely within the MFT and the cluster bitmap. This is perfectly adequate for an HDD, as NTFS can simply reuse the MFT entry and the clusters whenever it wishes. On an SSD the process from NTFS's point is exactly the same, as NTFS has no other way of deleting files. However all the SSD sees is exactly what an HDD would see, updates to a few pages. Neither an HDD nor an SSD knows that it's the MFT and cluster bit map being updated, as they have no knowledge of such things. As there is no activity on the deleted file's clusters, the SSD's pages holding the clusters remain mapped to their LBAs in the FTL. The SSD's FTL has no way of knowing that these pages are no longer allocated by NTFS: to the SSD the pages are still valid and will not be cleaned up by garbage collection.

</p><p>As these 'dead' pages are allocated to an LBA they could be released when files are allocated or extended and the host uses that LBA. In this case the page will be flagged as invalid and a new page used. However it is inevitable that eventually a significant amount of unused and unwanted baggage which is not flagged for garbage collection will be pointlessly maintained by the SSD controller and be unavailable for reuse. To overcome this, and to correlate the hosts view of allocated and unallocated pages with the SSD's, NTFS from Windows 7 onwards acquired the TRIM command.

</p><p><b>SSD Detection:</b>

</p><p>Although the storage device is abstracted from the File System, to enable some of the file system's SSD tweaks it needs to know whether the device is an HDD or SSD. There are various ways to do this, including querying the rotational speed of the device, which on an SSD should be zero (or perhaps one). This seems the most widely used and most proficient method.

</p><p><b>TRIM:</b>

</p><p>TRIM (it isn't an acronym) is a SATA command sent by the file system to the SSD controller to indicate that particular pages no longer contain live data, and are therfore candidates for garbage collection. TRIM is only supported in Windows on NTFS volumes. It is invoked on file deletion, partition deletion, and disk formatting. TRIM has to be supported by the SSD and enabled in NTFS to take effect. The command 'fsutil behavior query disabledeletenotify' returns 0 if TRIM is enabled in the operating system. It does not mean that the SSD supports it (or even if an SSD is actually installed) but all modern SSDs support a version of it.

</p><p>There are three different types of TRIM defined in the SATA protocol and implemented in SSD drives. Non-deterministic TRIM: where each read command after a TRIM may return different data; Deterministic TRIM (DRAT): where all read commands after a TRIM return the same data (i.e. become determinate) and do not change until new data is written; and Deterministic Read Zero after TRIM (DZAT): where all read commands after a TRIM return zeroes until the page is written with new data. By the way whilst DRAT returns data on a read it is not the userdata that was ptrviously there bafore the TRIM: it is random.

</p><p>Fortunately Non-Deterministic TRIM is rarely used, and Windows does not support DRAT, so a read of a trimmed page - which is easily done with a hex aditor - invokes DZAT and returns zeroes immediately after the TRIM command is issued. The physical pages may not have been cleaned immediately following the TRIM command, but the SSD controller knows that there is no valid data held at the trimmed page address.

</p><p>TRIM tells the FTL that the pages allocated to specific LBAs are to be classed as invalid. When a block no longer has any free pages, or a specific threshold is reached, the block is a candidate for garbage collection. Live data is copied to a new empty block, and the original block is erased and made available for reuse.

</p><p>TRIM is an asynchronous command that is queued for low-priority operation. It does not need or send a response. The size of the TRIM queue is limited and in times of high activity some TRIM commands may be dropped. There is no indication that this takes place, so some unwanted pages may escape garbage collection.

</p><p><b>RETRIM:</b>

</p><p>Windows Defragger - now called Storage Optimiser - has an option to Optimise SSDs. This does not defrag the SSD but sends a series of TRIM commands to all unallocated pages identified in NTFS's cluster bitmap. This global TRIM (or RETRIM) command is run at a granularity that the TRIM queue will never exceed its permitted size and no RETRIM commands will be dropped. A RETRIM is run automatically once a month by the storage optimiser.

</p><p><b>Over-provisioning:</b>

</p><p>All NAND flash devices use over-provisioning, additional capacity for extra write operations, controller firmware, failed block replacements, and other features utilised by the SSD controller. This capacity is not physically separate from the user capacity but is simply an amount of space in excess of that which can be allocated by the host. The specific pages within this excess space will vary dynamically as the SSD is used. According to Seagate, the minimum reserve is the difference between binary and decimal naming conventions. An SSD is marketed as a storage device and its capacity is measured in gigabytes (1,000,000,000 Bytes). NAND flash however is memory and is measured in gibibytes (1,073,741,824 bytes), making the minimum overprovisioning percentage just over 7.37%. Even if an SSD appears to the host to be full, it will still have 7.37% of available space with which to keep functioning and performing writes (although write performance will be diabolical). Manufacturers may further reduce the amount of capacity available to the user and set it aside as additional over-provisioning, in addition to the built-in 7.37%. Additional over-provisioning can also be created by the host by allocating a partition that does not use the drive's full capacity. The unallocated space will automatically be used by the controller as dynamic over-provisioning.

</p><p>My humble WD SSD has four 32 gb chips but a specified capacity of 120 gb, meaning that it has 8 gb set aside as additional over-provisioning. Add this to the 7.37% minimum (9.4 gb) and the 17.4 gb equates to almost 15% over-provisioning space.

</p><p><b>Wear Levelling:</b>

</p><p>Some files are written once and remain untouched for the rest of their life. Others have few updates, some very many. As a consequence some blocks will hardly ever see the invalid block pool and have a very low erase/write count, and some will be in the pool every few minutes and have a very heavy count. To spread the wear so that all blocks are subject to erase/writes equally, and the performance of the SSD is maintained over its life, wear levelling is used. Wear levelling uses algorithms to indentify blocks with the lowest erase count and move the contents to high erase count blocks; and to select low erase count blocks for new allocations. As with garbage collection, wear levelling is far more complex than I could possibly deduce, let alone explain.

</p><p><b>Read Disturbance:</b>

</p><p>SSD reads are not quite free, there is a price to pay. As described above, a read of one page generates a pass-through voltage on all other cells in the block. This voltage is likely to be below the highest threshold value that could be held by the cell, but it still generates a weak programming effect on the cells, which can unintentionally shift their threshold voltages. The pass-through voltage induces electric tunnelling that can shift the voltages of the unread cells to a higher value, disturbing the cell contents. As the size of flash cells is reduced the transistor oxide becomes thinner and in turn increases this tunnelling effect, with fewer read operations required to neighbouring pages for the unread flash cells to become disturbed, and move into a different logical state. Cells holding lower threshold values are more susceptible to read disturbance.

</p><p>Thus each read can cause the threshold voltages of other unread cells in the same block to shift to a higher value. After a significant amount of reads this can cause read errors for those cells. A read count is kept for each block and if it is exceeded the block is rewritten. The count is high for SLC cells, around 1m, lower for 25 nm MLC at around 40,000, and much lower for 15 nm TLC cells.

</p><p><b>File Recovery:</b>

</p><p>And now we come to deleted file recovery. NTFS goes through exactly the same process to delete a file on an SSD as it does on an HDD, with the exception of the additional TRIM command. And the TRIM command (assuming it's executed) and a few SSD quirks destroys any practicable chance of deleted file recovery.

</p><p>TRIM commands, as described above, have a complimentary setting within the SSD controller in the form of DRAT and DZAT. (I don't believe that non-deterministic TRIM is used in any reputable SSD, and I don't think that Windows supports DRAT, but I have no proof.) The implementation of DZAT means that immediately on successful execution of the TRIM command (which will in most cases be immediately on file deletion) any attempt to read the TRIMed page will return zeroes. The data on the page will still exist until the block is processed by the garbage collector, but that data is not accessible from the host by any practicable means, or any general software.

</p><p>Garbage collection is independent of the host device and will be invoked at the will of the SSD's controller. Once the process is started it cannot be stopped, apart from powering off the SSD. Once powered up again the garbage collector will resume its duties to completion.

</p><p>Deleted file recovery on a modern SSD is next to impossible for the end user, and under Windows as close to impossible as you can get. A theoretical examination of the chips would most likely show compressed and encrypted data, striped over multiple blocks, and no possibility of relating one page of data to another across the multiple millions of pages. There is a very small possibility of recovering recently deleted files by powering off the SSD immediately and sending it to a professional data recovery company. They may recover some data, given enough time and money.

</p><p>After a session of file deletion, such as running Piriform's CCleaner, run Recuva on the SSD. The headers of the deleted files found (and presumably the rest of the file) will all be zeroes. This is TRIM and DZAT doing their work in a few seconds, killing any chance of deleted file recovery. Of course TRIM can be disabled, at the cost of performance, but it's probably better to be a little less cavalier when deleting files that might be wanted later.

</p><p><b>Deletd File Security:</b>

</p><p>The notion of secure file deletion - overwriting a file's data before deletion - is irrelevant, and if any other pattern except zeroes is chosen is just additional and pointless wear on the SSD. Even overwriting with zeroes will cause transaction log and other files to be written, so secure file deletion on an SSD should never be used. Wiping Free Space is far worse for pointless writes, and is even more futile than secure file deletion. The deleted files just aren't there any more.

</p><p><b>The OCZ Myth:</b>

</p><p>Some years ago (as a little light relief to all these acres of text) the OCZ forums were buzzing with the latest method of regaining performance on their SSDs: run Piriform's CCleaner Wipe Free Space, with one overwrite pass of zeroes. Although performance may have been regained, logic, and common sense, went out of the window. The theory was that overwriting the pages with zeroes was equivalent to erasing blocks (this was before the days of TRIM). This was nonsense, and should have been apparent from the start. The default state of an empty page is all ones, not zeroes, and how could a piece of software possibly erase NAND flash?. The real reason was that as CCleaner was filling the pages with zeroes the SSD controller simply unmapped the pages and showed default pages of zeroes to the host. The invalid pages were then candidates for garbage collection, which gave a much greater pool of blocks to call upon on writes, and hence a better performance. A sort of RETRIM before that was invented.

</p><p><b>SSD Defragmentation:</b>

</p><p>One of the SSD mantras is that an SSD should never be defragged. Whilst there is little (there is a little) to be gained from rearranging clusters into adjacent pages - an SSD has no significant overhead in random reads - an SSD defrag is not entirely verboten. In fact from Windows 8 onwards the Storage Optimiser will defrag an SSD if certain conditions are met. If System Restore is enabled, the fragmentation level is above 10%, and at least one month has passed since the last defrag, Windows Storage Optimiser Scheduled Maintenance will defrag the SSD. This is what Microsoft calls a Traditional Defrag, it is not an Optimise (RETRIM). The defrag is required to reduce the extents on the volume snapshot files when system restore is enabled.

</p><p>There is nothing to be afraid of in a monthly defrag. Most users won't hit the 10% fragmented criteria so a simple RETRIM will be run, and Windows 10 users won't get defragged anyway (System Restore is disabled in Widows 10 by default). The reduction in life of an SSD will not be noticed. Furthermore, although SSDs are not fazed by random reads, files do get fragmented and that means a significant increase in I/Os. An occasional clearup is a boon.

</p><p><b>SSD Lifetime:</b>

There are many users worried about the life expectancy of their SSDs. Yes, continuous write/erase cycles, and the added and unseen write amplification, do take a toll on the life of NAND flash. Using an SSD does wear it out. My WD Green 120 gb SSD, a TLC SSD from a reputable manufacturer but at the very lowest cost, has an estimated life of 1 million+ hours and a write limit if 40 terabytes. One million hours is 114 years, so we can forget that. As for writes, at 1 gb a day - far more than my current rate of data use - it would take the same 114 years to reach 40 tb. Even with massive write overhead this SSD is not going to wear out in the forseeable future. If all 128 gib of available flash is used equally, the 40 tb equates to 312 writes per cell, a very conservative number.

</p><p><b>The End:</b>

</p><p>The only thing to add is that NAND flash, SSDs, and especially SSD controllers, are far more sophisticated, complex and incomprehensible than what has been written here, what I know, what I could possibly comprehend, and what I could possibly explain. I should also add secret, as their software is proprietary. Whilst an HDD is a marvel of complex electro-mechanical engineering at a ridiculously low cost, the SSD is an equally marvellous and complex piece of electronics and software at a minimally higher cost. We should be thankful for both.

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            The advancement of real-time 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis has been 
            significantly propelled by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). However, effectively training 
            large-scale 3DGS and rendering it in real-time across various scales remains challenging. 
            This paper introduces CityGaussian (CityGS), which employs a novel divide-and-conquer 
            training approach and Level-of-Detail (LoD) strategy for efficient large-scale 3DGS 
            training and rendering. Specifically, the global scene prior and adaptive training data 
            selection enables efficient training and seamless fusion. Based on fused Gaussian primitives, 
            we generate different detail levels through compression, and realize fast rendering across 
            various scales through the proposed block-wise detail levels selection and aggregation 
            strategy. Extensive experimental results on large-scale scenes demonstrate that our approach 
            attains state-of-the-art rendering quality, enabling consistent real-time rendering of 
            large-scale scenes across vastly different scales.

<p dir="auto">We accomplish these results by designing simple LM-centric commands and feedback formats to make it easier for the LM to browse the repository, view, edit and execute code files. We call this an <strong>Agent-Computer Interface</strong> (ACI) and build the SWE-agent repository to make it easy to iterate on ACI design for repository-level coding agents.</p>
<p dir="auto">Just like how typical language models requires good prompt engineering, good ACI design leads to much better results when using agents. As we show in our paper, a baseline agent without a well-tuned ACI does much worse than SWE-agent.</p>
<p dir="auto">SWE-agent contains features that we discovered to be immensly helpful during the agent-computer interface design process:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>We add a linter that runs when an edit command is issued, and do not let the edit command go through if the code isn't syntactically correct.</li>
<li>We supply the agent with a special-built file viewer, instead of having it just <code>cat</code> files. We found that this file viewer works best when displaying just 100 lines in each turn. The file editor that we built has commands for scrolling up and down and for performing a search within the file.</li>
<li>We supply the agent with a special-built full-directory string searching command. We found that it was important for this tool to succintly list the matches- we simply list each file that had at least one match. Showing the model more context about each match proved to be too confusing for the model.</li>
<li>When commands have an empty output we return a message saying "Your command ran successfully and did not produce any output."</li>
</ol>

<p dir="auto">There are two steps to the SWE-agent pipeline. First SWE-agent takes an input GitHub issue and returns a pull request that attempts to fix it. We call that step <em>inference</em>. The second step (currently, only available for issues in the SWE-bench benchmark) is to <em>evaluate</em> the pull request to verify that it has indeed fixed the issue.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>NOTE</em>: At this moment, there are known issues with a small number of repositories that don't install properly for <code>arm64</code> / <code>aarch64</code> architecture computers. We're working on a fix, but if you'd like to run and evaluate on the entirety of SWE-bench, the easiest way is by using an <code>x86</code> machine.</p>
