                  <p>It's also confusion that reporting of a bug is not criticism. It's a Show HN. You've asked for the feedback. People that get twisted when the feedback is anything other than pablum like "great job" need not be a developer. If you can't handle being told that something isn't working, then how do you ever expect to improve? Or maybe you've moved from being a dev and are now trying to be a founder?</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p><b>September 12, 2024</b></p>
<p><strong><newslead>Doctor Web experts have uncovered yet another case of an Android-based TV box infection. The malware, dubbed <a href="https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.Vo1d&amp;lng=en"><b>Android.Vo1d</b></a>, has infected nearly 1.3 million devices belonging to users in 197 countries. It is a backdoor that puts its components in the system storage area and, when commanded by attackers, is capable of secretly downloading and installing third-party software.</newslead></strong></p>

<p>In August 2024, Doctor Web was contacted by several users whose Dr.Web antivirus had detected changes in their device’s system file area. The problem occurred with these models:</p>

<table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>TV box model</th>
        <th>Declared firmware version</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>R4</td>
        <td>Android 7.1.2; R4 Build/NHG47K</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>TV BOX</td>
        <td>Android 12.1; TV BOX Build/NHG47K</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>KJ-SMART4KVIP</td>
        <td>Android 10.1; KJ-SMART4KVIP Build/NHG47K</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>All these cases involved similar signs of infection, so we will describe them using one of the first requests we received as an example. The following objects were changed on the affected TV box:</p>
<ul>
  <li><span>install-recovery.sh</span></li>
  <li><span>daemonsu</span></li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, 4 new files emerged in its file system:</p>
<ul>
  <li><span>/system/xbin/vo1d</span></li>
  <li><span>/system/xbin/wd</span></li>
  <li><span>/system/bin/debuggerd</span></li>
  <li><span>/system/bin/debuggerd_real</span></li>
</ul>

<p>The <span>vo1d</span> and <span>wd</span> files are the components of the <a href="https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.Vo1d&amp;lng=en"><b>Android.Vo1d</b></a> trojan that we discovered.</p>

<blockquote>
  The trojan’s authors probably tried to disguise one if its components as the system program /system/bin/vold, having called it by the similar-looking name “vo1d” (substituting the lowercase letter “l” with the number “1”). The malicious program’s name comes from the name of this file. Moreover, this spelling is consonant with the English word “void”.
</blockquote>

<p>The <span>install-recovery.sh</span> file is a script that is present on most Android devices. It runs when the operating system is launched and contains data for autorunning the elements specified in it. If any malware has root access and the ability to write to the <span>/system</span> system directory, it can anchor itself in the infected device by adding itself to this script (or by creating it from scratch if it is not present in the system). <a href="https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.Vo1d&amp;lng=en"><b>Android.Vo1d</b></a> has registered the autostart for the <span>wd</span> component in this file.</p>

<p><a href="https://st.drweb.com/static/new-www/news/2024/september/01_recovery.png">
    <img src="https://st.drweb.com/static/new-www/news/2024/september/01_recovery.png" alt="The modified install-recovery.sh file">
  </a>
</p>
<p><em>The modified install-recovery.sh file</em></p>

<p>The <span>daemonsu</span> file is present on many Android devices with root access. It is launched by the operating system when it starts and is responsible for providing root privileges to the user. <a href="https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.Vo1d&amp;lng=en"><b>Android.Vo1d</b></a> registered itself in this file, too, having also set up autostart for the <span>wd</span> module.</p>

<p>The <span>debuggerd</span> file is a daemon that is typically used to create reports on occurred errors. But when the TV box was infected, this file was replaced by the script that launches the <span>wd</span> component.</p>

<p>The <span>debuggerd_real</span> file in the case we are reviewing is a copy of the script that was used to substitute the real <span>debuggerd</span> file. Doctor Web experts believe that the trojan’s authors intended the original <span>debuggerd</span> to be moved into <span>debuggerd_real</span> to maintain its functionality. However, because the infection probably occurred twice, the trojan moved the already substituted file (i.e., the script). As a result, the device had two scripts from the trojan and not a single real <span>debuggerd</span> program file.</p>

<p>At the same time, other users who contacted us had a slightly different list of files on their infected devices:</p>
<ul>
  <li><span>daemonsu</span> (the <span>vo1d</span> file analogue — <a href="https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.Vo1d.1&amp;lng=en"><b>Android.Vo1d.1</b></a>);</li>
  <li><span>wd</span> (<a href="https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.Vo1d.3&amp;lng=en"><b>Android.Vo1d.3</b></a>);</li>
  <li><span>debuggerd</span> (the same script as described above);</li>
  <li><span>debuggerd_real</span> (the original file of the <span>debuggerd</span> tool);</li>
  <li><span>install-recovery.sh</span> (a script that loads objects specified in it).  </li>
</ul>

<p>An analysis of all the aforementioned files showed that in order to anchor <a href="https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.Vo1d%20in%20the&amp;lng=en"><b>Android.Vo1d in the</b></a> system, its authors used at least three different methods: modification of the <span>install-recovery.sh</span> and <span>daemonsu</span> files and substitution of the <span>debuggerd</span> program. They probably expected that at least one of the target files would be present in the infected system, since manipulating even one of them would ensure the trojan’s successful auto launch during subsequent device reboots. </p>

<p><a href="https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.Vo1d&amp;lng=en"><b>Android.Vo1d</b></a>’s main functionality is concealed in its <span>vo1d</span> (<a href="https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.Vo1d.1&amp;lng=en"><b>Android.Vo1d.1</b></a>) and <span>wd</span> (<a href="https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.Vo1d.3&amp;lng=en"><b>Android.Vo1d.3</b></a>) components, which operate in tandem. The <a href="https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.Vo1d.1&amp;lng=en"><b>Android.Vo1d.1</b></a> module is responsible for <a href="https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.Vo1d.3&amp;lng=en"><b>Android.Vo1d.3</b></a>’s launch and controls its activity, restarting its process if necessary. In addition, it can download and run executables when commanded to do so by the C&amp;C server. In turn, the <a href="https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.Vo1d.3&amp;lng=en"><b>Android.Vo1d.3</b></a> module installs and launches the <a href="https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.Vo1d.5&amp;lng=en"><b>Android.Vo1d.5</b></a> daemon that is encrypted and stored in its body. This module can also download and run executables. Moreover, it monitors specified directories and installs the APK files that it finds in them.</p>

<p>A study conducted by Doctor Web malware analysts showed that the <a href="https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.Vo1d&amp;lng=en"><b>Android.Vo1d</b></a> backdoor has infected around 1.3 million devices, while its geographical distribution included almost 200 countries. The largest number of infections were detected in Brazil, Morocco, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Argentina, Ecuador, Tunisia, Malaysia, Algeria, and Indonesia.</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://st.drweb.com/static/new-www/news/2024/september/02_Android.Vo1d_map_en.png">
    <img src="https://st.drweb.com/static/new-www/news/2024/september/02_Android.Vo1d_map_en.png" alt="Countries with the highest number of infected devices detected">
  </a>
</p>
<p><em>Countries with the highest number of infected devices detected</em></p>

<p>One possible reason why the attackers distributing <a href="https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.Vo1d&amp;lng=en"><b>Android.Vo1d</b></a> specifically chose TV boxes is that such devices often run on outdated Android versions, which have unpatched vulnerabilities and are no longer supported with updates. For example, the users who contacted us have models that are based on Android 7.1, despite the fact that for some of them the configuration indicates much newer versions, such as Android 10 and Android 12. Unfortunately, it is not uncommon for budget device manufacturers to utilize older OS versions and pass them off as more up-to-date ones to make them more attractive.</p>

<p>In addition, users themselves may mistakenly perceive TV boxes to be better protected devices, compared to smartphones. As a result, they may install anti-virus software on these less often and risk encountering malware when downloading third-party apps or installing unofficial firmware. </p>

<p>At the moment, the source of the TV boxes’ backdoor infection remains unknown. One possible infection vector could be an attack by an intermediate malware that exploits operating system vulnerabilities to gain root privileges. Another possible vector could be the use of unofficial firmware versions with built-in root access.</p>

<p>Dr.Web anti-virus for Android successfully detects all known <a href="https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.Vo1d&amp;lng=en"><b>Android.Vo1d</b></a> trojan variants, and, if root access is available, cures the infected devices.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <p>My <a href="https://louwrentius.com/71-tib-diy-nas-based-on-zfs-on-linux.html">4U 71 TiB ZFS NAS</a> built with twenty-four 4 TB drives is over 10 years old and still going strong.</p>
<p><img alt="my nas" src="https://louwrentius.com/static/images/zfsnas01.jpg"></p>
<p>Although now on its second motherboard and power supply, the system has yet to experience a single drive failure (knock on wood).</p>
<p>Zero drive failures in ten years, how is that possible?</p>
<h2>Let's talk about the drives first</h2>
<p>The 4 TB HGST drives have roughly 6000 hours on them after ten years. You might think something's off and you'd be right. That's only about 250 days worth of runtime. And therein lies the secret of drive longevity (I think):</p>
<p><strong>Turn the server off when you're not using it.</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>According to people on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41536088">Hacker News</a> I have my bearings wrong. The chance of having zero drive failures over 10 years for 24 drives is much higher than I thought it was. So this good result may not be related to turning my NAS off and keeping it off most off the time.</p>
<hr>
<p>My NAS is turned off by default. I only turn it on (remotely) when I need to use it. I use a script to turn the IoT power bar on and once the BMC (Baseboard Management Controller) is done booting, I use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_Platform_Management_Interface">IPMI</a> to turn on the NAS itself. But I could have used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake-on-LAN">Wake-on-Lan</a> too as an alternative.</p>
<p>Once I'm done using the server, I run a small script that turns the server off, wait a few seconds and then turn the wall socket off. </p>
<p>It wasn't enough for me to just turn off the server, but leave the motherboard, and thus the BMC powered, because that's just a constant 7 watts (about two Raspberry Pis at idle) being wasted (24/7).</p>
<p>This process works for me because I run other services on low-power devices such as Raspberry Pi4s or servers that use <em>much less power</em> when idling than my 'big' NAS. </p>
<p>This proces reduces my energy bill considerably (primary motivation) and also seems great for hard drive longevity.</p>
<p>Although zero drive failures to date is awesome, N=24 is not very representative and I could just be very lucky. Yet, it was the same story with the <a href="https://louwrentius.com/20-disk-18-tb-raid-6-storage-based-on-debian-linux.html">predecessor of this NAS</a>, a machine with 20 drives (1 TB Samsung Spinpoint F1s (remember those?)) and I also had zero drive failures during its operational lifespan (~5 years).</p>
<h2>The motherboard (died once)</h2>
<p>Although the drives are still ok, I had to replace the motherboard a few years ago. The failure mode of the motherboard was interesting: it was impossible to get into the BIOS and it would occasionally fail to boot. I tried the obvious like removing the CMOS battery and such but to no avail.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the [motherboard]<sup id="fnref:same"><a href="#fn:same">1</a></sup> was still available on Ebay for a decent price so that ended up not being a big deal. </p>
<h2>ZFS</h2>
<p>ZFS worked fine for all these years. I've switched operating systems over the years and I never had an issue importing the pool back into the new OS install.
If I would build a new storage server, I would definitely use ZFS again.</p>
<p>I run a zpool scrub on the drives a few times a year<sup id="fnref:longduration"><a href="#fn:longduration">2</a></sup>. The scrub has <em>never found a single checksum error</em>. I must have run so many scrubs, more than a <em>petabyte</em> of data must have been read from the drives (all drives combined) and ZFS didn't have to kick in.</p>
<p>I'm not surprised by this result at all. Drives tend to fail most often in two modes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Total failure, drive isn't even detected</li>
<li>Bad sectors (read or write failures)</li>
</ol>
<p>There is a third failure mode, but it's extremely rare: <strong>silent data corruption</strong>. Silent data corruption is 'silent' because a disk isn't aware it delivered corrupted data. Or the SATA connection didn't detect any checksum errors. </p>
<p>However, due to all the low-level checksumming, this risk is extremely small. It's a real risk, don't get me wrong, but it's a small risk. To me, it's a risk you mostly care about at scale, in datacenters<sup id="fnref:enterprise"><a href="#fn:enterprise">4</a></sup> but for residential usage, it's totally reasonable to accept the risk<sup id="fnref:risk"><a href="#fn:risk">3</a></sup>. </p>
<p>But ZFS is not that difficult to learn and if you are well-versed in Linux or FreeBSD, it's absolutely worth checking out. Just <a href="https://louwrentius.com/the-hidden-cost-of-using-zfs-for-your-home-nas.html">remember</a>!</p>
<p><img alt="inside" src="https://louwrentius.com/static/images/nano/topview.jpg"></p>
<h2>Sound levels (It's Oh So Quiet)</h2>
<p>This NAS is <em>very</em> quiet for a NAS (<a href="https://youtu.be/LS3cfl-7n-4">video with audio</a>). </p>
<p>But to get there, I had to do some work.</p>
<p>The chassis contains three sturdy 12V fans that cool the 24 drive cages. These fans are extremely loud if they run at their default speed. But because they are so beefy, they are fairly quiet when they run at idle RPM, yet they still provide enough airflow, most of the time. But running at idle speeds was not enough as the drives would heat up eventually, especially when they are being read from / written to.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the particular Supermicro motherboard I bought at the time allows all fan headers to be controlled through Linux. So I decided to create a <a href="https://github.com/louwrentius/storagefancontrol">script</a> that sets the fan speed according to the temperature of the hottest drive in the chassis.</p>
<p>I actually visited a math-related subreddit and asked for an algorithm that would best fit my need to create a silent setup and also keep the drives cool.
Somebody recommended to use a "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional%E2%80%93integral%E2%80%93derivative_controller">PID controller</a>", which I knew nothing about. So I wrote some Python, stole some example Python PID controller code, and tweaked the parameters to find a balance between sound and cooling performance.</p>
<p>The script has worked very well over the years and kept the drives at 40C or below. PID controllers are awesome and I feel it should be used in much more equipment that controls fans, temperature, and so on, instead of 'dumb' on/of behaviour or less 'dumb' lookup tables.</p>
<h2>Networking</h2>
<p>I started out with quad-port gigabit network controllers and I used <a href="https://louwrentius.com/achieving-450-mbs-network-file-transfers-using-linux-bonding.html">network bonding</a> to get around 450 MB/s network transfer speeds between various systems. This setup required a ton of UTP cables so eventually I got bored with that and I bought some cheap <a href="https://louwrentius.com/using-infiniband-for-cheap-and-fast-point-to-point-networking.html">Infiniband</a> cards and that worked fine, I could reach around 700 MB/s between systems. As I decided to move away from Ubuntu and back to Debian, I faced a problem: the Infiniband cards didn't work anymore and I could not figure out how to fix it. So I decided to buy some second-hand 10Gbit Ethernet cards and those work totally fine to this day.</p>
<h2>The dead power supply</h2>
<p>When you turn this system on, all drives spin up at once (no staggered spinup) and that draws around 600W for a few seconds. I remember that the power supply was rated for 750W and the 12 volt rail would have been able to deliver enough power, but it would sometimes cut out at boot nonetheless.</p>
<h2>UPS (or lack thereof)</h2>
<p>For many years, I used a beefy UPS with the system, to protect against power failure, just to be able to shutdown cleanly during an outage. This worked fine, but I noticed that the UPS used another 10+ watts on top of the usage of the server and I decided it had to go.</p>
<p>Losing the system due to power shenanigans is a risk I accept.</p>
<h2>Backups (or a lack thereof)</h2>
<p>My most important data is backed up trice. But a lot of data stored on this server isn't important enough for me to backup. I rely on replacement hardware and ZFS protecting against data loss due to drive failure.</p>
<p>And if that's not enough, I'm out of luck. I've accepted that risk for 10 years. Maybe one day my luck will run out, but until then, I enjoy what I have.</p>
<h2>Future storage plans (or lack thereof)</h2>
<p>To be frank, I don't have any. I built this server back in the day because I didn't want to shuffle data around due to storage space constraints and I still have ample space left.</p>
<p>I have a spare motherboard, CPU, Memory and a spare HBA card so I'm quite likely able to revive the system if something breaks.</p>
<p>As hard drive sizes have increased tremendously, I may eventually move away from the 24-drive bay chassis into a smaller form-factor. It's possible to create the same amount of redundant storage space with only 6-8 hard drives with RAIDZ2 (RAID 6) redundancy. Yet, storage is always expensive. </p>
<p>But another likely scenario is that in the coming years this system eventually dies and I decide not to replace it at all, and my storage hobby will come to an end.</p>

<h3 id="arc-prize-testing-and-notes-on-openais-new-o1-model">ARC Prize testing and notes on OpenAI's new o1 model</h3>

<p>Over the past 24 hours, we got access to OpenAI's newly released <code>o1-preview</code> and <code>o1-mini</code> models specially trained to emulate reasoning. These models are given extra time to generate and refine reasoning tokens before giving a final answer.</p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/arcprize/status/1834348966663856577" target="_blank">Hundreds of people</a> have asked how o1 stacks up on ARC Prize. So we put it to test using the same baseline testing harness we've used to assess Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o, and Gemini 1.5. Here are the results:</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.zappy.app/9b60c2cb230af28f29a5f2a0506dbff1.png" alt="ARC-AGI-Pub Leaderboard"></p>

<p>Is o1 a new paradigm towards AGI? Will it scale up? What explains the massive difference between o1's performance on IOI, AIME, and many other <a href="https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/" target="_blank">impressive benchmark scores</a> compared to only modest scores on ARC-AGI?</p>

<p>There's a lot to talk about.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="chain-of-thought">Chain-of-Thought</h3>

<p>o1 fully realizes the "let's think step by step" chain-of-thought (CoT) paradigm by applying it at both training time <em>and</em> test time inference.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://arcprize.org/media/images/blog/openai-o1-performance.png" alt="OpenAI o1 Performance Chart">
  <figcaption>Source: OpenAI "<a href="https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/" target="_blank">Learning to Reason with LLMs</a>".</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In practice, o1 is significantly less likely to make mistakes when performing tasks where the sequence of intermediate steps is well-represented in the synthetic CoT training data.</p>

<p>At training time, OpenAI says they've built a new reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm and a highly data-efficient process that leverages CoT.</p>

<p>The implication is that the foundational source of o1 training is still a fixed set of pre-training data. But OpenAI is also able to generate tons of synthetic CoTs that emulate human reasoning to further train the model via RL. An unanswered question is how OpenAI selects which generated CoTs to train on?</p>

<p>While we have few details, reward signals for RL were likely achieved using verification (over formal domains like math and code) and human labeling (over informal domains like task breakdown and planning.)</p>

<p>At inference time, OpenAI says they're using RL to enable o1 to hone its CoT and refine the strategies it uses. We can speculate the reward signal here is some kind of actor + critic system similar to ones OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/index/finding-gpt4s-mistakes-with-gpt-4/" target="_blank">previously published</a>. And that they're applying search or backtracking over the generated reasoning tokens at inference time.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="test-time-compute">Test-Time Compute</h3>

<p>The most important aspect of o1 is that it shows a working example of applying CoT reasoning search to informal language as opposed to formal languages like math, code, or Lean.</p>

<p>While added train-time scaling using CoT is notable, the big new story is test-time scaling.</p>

<p>We believe iterated CoT genuinely unlocks greater generalization. Automatic iterative re-prompting enables the model to better adapt to novelty, in a way similar to test-time fine-tuning leveraged by the MindsAI team.</p>

<p>If we only do a single inference, we are limited to reapplying memorized programs. But by generating intermediate output CoTs, or programs, for each task, we unlock the ability to compose learned programs components, achieving adaption. This technique is one way to surmount the #1 issue of large language model generalization: the ability to adapt to novelty. Though like test-time fine-tuning it does ultimately remain limited.</p>

<p>When AI systems are allowed a variable amount of test-time compute (e.g., the amount of reasoning tokens or the time to search), there is no objective way to report a single benchmark score because it's relative to the allowed compute. That is what <a href="https://arcprize.org/media/images/blog/openai-o1-performance.png">this chart</a> shows.</p>

<p>More compute means more accuracy.</p>

<p>When OpenAI released o1 they could have allowed developers to specify the amount of compute or time allowed to refine CoT at test-time. Instead, they've "hard coded" a point along the test-time compute continuum and hid that implementation detail from developers.</p>

<p>With varying test-time compute, we can no longer just compare the output between two different AI systems to assess relative intelligence. We need to also compare the compute <em>efficiency</em>.</p>

<p>While OpenAI's announcement did not share efficiency numbers, it's exciting we're now entering a period where efficiency will be a focus. Efficiency is critical to the <a href="https://arcprize.org/arc#agi-definition">definition of AGI</a> and this is why ARC Prize enforces an efficiency limit on winning solutions.</p>

<p><strong>Our prediction</strong>: expect to see way more benchmark charts comparing accuracy vs test-time compute going forward.</p>

<h3 id="arc-agi-pub-model-baselines">ARC-AGI-Pub Model Baselines</h3>

<p>OpenAI <code>o1-preview</code> and <code>o1-mini</code> both outperform <code>GPT-4o</code> on the ARC-AGI public evaluation dataset. <code>o1-preview</code> is about on par with Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet in terms of accuracy but takes about 10X longer to achieve similar results to Sonnet.</p>

<p>To get the baseline model scores on the ARC-AGI-Pub leaderboard, we're using the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/gregkamradt/using-frontier-models-on-arc-agi-via-langchain?scriptVersionId=184611945" target="_blank">same baseline prompt</a> we used to test <code>GPT-4o</code>. When we test and report results on pure models like o1, our intention is to get a measurement of base model performance, as much as that is possible, without layering on any optimization.</p>

<p>Others may discover better ways to prompt CoT-style models in the future, and we are happy to add those to the leaderboard if verified.</p>

<p>o1's performance increase did come with a time cost. It took 70 hours on the 400 public tasks compared to only 30 minutes for <code>GPT-4o</code> and Claude 3.5 Sonnet.</p>

<p>You can use our <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/gregkamradt/testing-o1-preview-on-arc-agi" target="_blank">open source Kaggle notebook</a> as a baseline testing harness or starting point for your own approach. The SOTA submission on the public leaderboard is the result of clever techniques in addition to cutting edge models.</p>

<p>Maybe you can figure out how to leverage o1 as a foundational component to achieve a higher score in a similar way!</p>



<hr>

<h2 id="is-agi-here">Is AGI Here?</h2>

<p>On <a href="https://arcprize.org/media/images/blog/openai-o1-performance.png">this chart</a>, OpenAI shows a log-linear relationship between accuracy and test-time compute on AIME. In other words, with exponentially increasing compute, accuracy goes up linearly.</p>

<p>A new question many are asking: how far does this scale?</p>

<p>The only conceptual limit to the approach is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decidability_(logic)" target="_blank">decidability</a> of the problem posed to the AI. So long as the search process has an external verifier which does contain the answer, you will see accuracy scale up logarithmically with compute.</p>

<p>In fact, the reported results are extremely similar to one of ARC Prize's <a href="https://redwoodresearch.substack.com/p/getting-50-sota-on-arc-agi-with-gpt" target="_blank">top approaches</a> by Ryan Greenblatt. He achieved a score of 43% by having <code>GPT-4o</code> generate k=2,048 solution programs per task and deterministically verifying them against the task demonstrations.</p>

<p>Then he assessed how accuracy varied for different values of k.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://arcprize.org/media/images/blog/o1-top-3-accuracy-vs-k.jpg" alt="Top 3 Accuracy vs k">
  <figcaption>Source: Ryan Greenblatt.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Ryan found an identical log-linear relationship between accuracy and test-time compute on ARC-AGI.</p>

<p>Does all this mean AGI is here if we just scale test-time compute? Not quite.</p>

<p>You can see similar exponential scaling curves by looking at any brute force search which is O(x^n). In fact, we know at least 50% of ARC-AGI can be solved via brute force and zero AI.</p>

<p>To beat ARC-AGI this way, you'd need to generate over 100 million solution programs per task. Practicality alone rules out O(x^n) search for scaled up AI systems.</p>

<p>Moreover, we know this is not how humans beat ARC tasks. Humans do not generate thousands of potential solutions, instead we use the perception network in our brains to "see" a handful of potential solutions and determnistically check them with system 2-style thinking.</p>

<p>We can get smarter.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="new-ideas-are-needed">New Ideas Are Needed</h2>

<p>Intelligence can be measured by looking at how well a system converts information to action over a space of situations. It's a conversion ratio and thus approaches a limit. Once you have perfect intelligence, the only way to progress is to go collect new information.</p>

<p>There are a couple ways a less intelligent system could appear more intelligent without actually being more intelligent.</p>

<p>One way is a system that just memorizes the best action. This kind of system would be very brittle, appearing intelligent in one domain, but fall over easily in another.</p>

<p>Another way is through trial and error. A system might appear intelligent if it eventually gets the right answer, but not if it needs 100 guesses first.</p>

<p>We should expect future test-time compute research to look at how to scale search and refinement more efficiently, perhaps using deep learning to guide the search process.</p>

<p>That said, we don't believe this alone explains the big gap between o1's performance on ARC-AGI and other objectively difficult benchmarks like IOI or AIME.</p>

<p>A more sufficient way to explain this is that o1 still operates primarily within distribution of its pre-training data, but now inclusive of all the newly generated synthetic CoTs.</p>

<p>The additional synthetic CoT data increases focus on the distribution of CoTs as opposed to just the distribution of answers (more compute is spent on how to get the answer vs what is the answer). We expect to see systems like o1 do better on benchmarks that involve reusing well-known emulated reasoning templates (programs) but will still struggle to crack problems that require synthesizing brand new reasoning on the fly.</p>

<p>Test-time refinement on CoT can only correct reasoning mistakes so far. This also suggests why o1 is so impressive in certain domains. Test-time refinement on CoT gets an additional boost when the base model is pre-trained in a similar way.</p>

<p>Either approach alone would not get you the big leap.</p>

<p>In summary, o1 represents a paradigm shift from "memorize the answers" to "memorize the reasoning" but is not a departure from the broader paradigm of fitting a curve to a distribution in order to boost performance by making everything in-distribution.</p>

<p>We still need new ideas for AGI.</p>

<p dir="auto">A simple, lexically scoped Lisp interpreter that operates fully in Rust's declarative macros. The <code>lisp!</code> macro expands to the lisp value computed by the code, and then stringifies it. This means that <code>lisp!(CAR (CONS (QUOTE A) (QUOTE (B))))</code> expands to the string "A" and that all this computation happens at compile time by rustc expanding macros.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why</h2><a id="user-content-why" aria-label="Permalink: Why" href="#why"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">It's a lisp interpreter written fully in Rust's macros, I think that's pretty cool. It's also less than 250 lines, which is neat.</p>

<p dir="auto">This lisp does not currently support any explicit form of recursion. Luckily, explicit recursion is not needed, all we need is lambda.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can write a simple function that appends two lists by using self application:</p>

<span>)</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This results in "(A B C D)". The append function does not mention <code>append</code> in its body, yet we can call it recursively. Wonderful!</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Notes for use</h2><a id="user-content-notes-for-use" aria-label="Permalink: Notes for use" href="#notes-for-use"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The lisp! macro only evaluates a single expression; if you want to evaluate multiple expressions, use <code>(PROGN expr1 expr2 expr3)</code>. This evaluates all the expressions, and returns the value of the last expression. The DISPLAY form evaluates a single expression, then generates a <code>println!("{}", stringify!(...))</code> statement which prints the stringified version of the tokens. The empty list is not self evaluating, you can use <code>NIL</code> or <code>(QUOTE ())</code> to obtain an empty list value. The empty list is the sole "falsy" object.
Dotted lists aren't supported, cons assumes its last argument is a list. The define form can be used anywhere and evaluates to the empty list, but does not support recursion. TRUE is the only self evaluating atom (that isn't a function).</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Meta has acknowledged that all text and photos that adult Facebook and Instagram users have publicly published since 2007 have been fed into its artificial intelligence models. <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-09-11/facebook-scraping-photos-data-no-opt-out/104336170">Australia’s ABC News reports</a> that Meta’s global privacy director, Melinda Claybaugh, initially rejected claims about user data from 2007 being leveraged for AI training during a local government inquiry about AI adoption before relenting after additional questioning.</p><p>“The truth of the matter is that unless you have consciously set those posts to private since 2007, Meta has just decided that you will scrape all of the photos and all of the texts from every public post on Instagram or Facebook since 2007 unless there was a conscious decision to set them on private,” Green Party senator David Shoebridge pushed in the inquiry. “That’s the reality, isn’t it?”</p><p>“Correct,” Claybaugh responded.</p><p>Meta’s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/privacy/guide/generative-ai/">privacy center</a> and <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/09/privacy-matters-metas-generative-ai-features/">blog posts</a> acknowledge hoovering up public posts and comments from Facebook and Instagram to train generative AI:</p><div><blockquote><p>We use public posts and comments on Facebook and Instagram to train generative AI models for these features and for the open source community.</p><p>We don’t use posts or comments with an audience other than Public for these purposes.</p></blockquote></div><p>But the company has been vague about how data is used, when it started scraping, and how far back its collection goes. Asked by <em>The New York Times</em> in June, Meta didn’t answer, other than to confirm that setting posts <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/07/technology/meta-ai-scraping-policy.html">to anything besides “public” will prevent future scraping</a>. That still won’t delete data that has already been collected — and people posting back in 2007 (who may have been minors at the time) wouldn’t have known their photos and posts would be used in this way.</p><p>Claybaugh said that Meta doesn’t scrape data from users who are under the age of 18. When Labor Party senator Tony Sheldon asked if Meta would scrape the public photos of his children on his own account, Claybaugh confirmed it would and was unable to clarify if the company also scraped adult accounts that were created when the user was still a child.</p><p>European users can opt out <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/14/24178591/meta-ai-assistant-europe-ireland-privacy-objections">due to local privacy regulations</a>, and Meta was recently <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/3/24191405/meta-anpd-stop-training-ai-on-brazilian-facebook-instagram-data">banned from using Brazilian personal data</a> for AI training, but the billions of Facebook and Instagram users in other regions can’t opt out if they want to keep their posts public. Claybaugh was unable to say if Australian users (or anyone else) would be given a choice to opt out in the future, arguing that the option was given to European users because of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/18/24201041/meta-multimodal-llama-ai-model-launch-eu-regulations">uncertainty regarding its regulatory landscape</a>.</p><p>“Meta made it clear today that if Australia had these same laws Australians’ data would also have been protected,” Shoebridge said to ABC News. “The government’s failure to act on privacy means companies like Meta are continuing to monetize and exploit pictures and videos of children on Facebook.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Let's say you have a fiber optic line running between two buildings, or between two spaces you rent in the same building. You use trunk ports on the switches connected to the fiber, in order to "stretch" your L2 Ethernet network and its different VLANs, so computers, servers, printers, cameras, etc. in both offices easily communicate with their peers.</p>
<p>But there is next to no physical security in the shared wiring closets and common cabling paths, and so you are concerned about someone <em>tapping</em>&nbsp;into the fiber line and capturing data.</p>
<p>First you may ask, is that really possible? And if so, is it easy to do? Would you need NSA-level hardware and skills or could anyone do it?</p>
<p>Turns out, it is both possible and easy, so you're right to worry! But there is a solution...</p>

<h3>Tapping on copper cables<br>
&nbsp;</h3>
<p>It's so simple to tap on copper network cables that back in the 80s, it was the official way to expand your 10BASE5 Ethernet network. IT people&nbsp;used so-called "vampire taps" that truly <em>bit</em> through the insulation of the cable to make contact with the conductors inside, enabling a new connection without interrupting ongoing data transmission.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@davidbombal/video/7246772712696335643">This&nbsp;TikTok video</a> shows one of these devices in action.</p>
<p>Nowadays, people might still use copper cables instead of fiber for distances &lt; 100m, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_tap#Gigabit_Ethernet_issues">it's a bit more difficult to tap on 1000BASE-T modern cables</a>. Anyway, since our typical LAN-to-LAN scenario rather involves optical fibers running along not-well-protected cable runways, let's see if optical fibers are&nbsp;vulnerable too.</p>
<h3><br>
Tapping on optical fiber<br>
&nbsp;</h3>
<p>For a number of years it was commonly believed that tapping on optical fibers was possible, but that it needed both expertise and expensive hardware.</p>
<p>But in 2015, the late <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/infamous-hacker-kevin-mitnick-sniffs-fiber-reads-email/">Kevin Mitnick demonstrated just how easy it is to tap into a fiber and sniff the traffic</a>, using a 200$ optical "clip-on coupler".</p>
<p>These&nbsp;couplers are originally designed to be used by line technicians to talk to one another over long distances using so-called "optical talk sets", and&nbsp;coordinate with one another while installing these&nbsp;fibers, even when they have no access to the ends of the fiber.</p>
<p>They work by exposing a portion of the fiber core and bending it slightly,&nbsp;reflecting some 2-3% of the light inside the fiber (but still 100% of its data) and also allowing to inject light in it. Of course, it's better to have some practice and a steady hand in order to expose the fiber core without damaging the fiber.</p>
<p>In true hacker fashion, these&nbsp;couplers are creatively used by attackers to read data from the fiber, and inject data of their own.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group">
<img alt="clip-on coupler like the one used by Mitnick" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="f8ad2517-2643-41eb-b7d6-358848d41033" src="https://www.synacktiv.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/clip_on_coupler_small.jpg">
<figcaption>The&nbsp;FOD5516 Clip-on Coupler that can detect and inject light in (singlemode) optical fiber</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This opens many classical man-in-the-middle attack scenarios such as forcing the downgrade&nbsp;of crypto protocols, redirecting traffic, etc. on top of simple sniffing.</p>

<h2>Encrypt ALL the things !<br>
&nbsp;</h2>
<p>So it seems there's not much you can do to prevent vampire tapping onto your easily-accessible cable paths. In fact, they might already be there...</p>
<p>As with any confidentiality issue, the best solution lies in encryption. If your whole network traffic is encrypted, the data vampires might still suck on your network cables, but instead of draining the very blood of your company, they will only gather encrypted gibberish of no use to them.</p>
<p>But how exactly can you encrypt "everything" in such a LAN-to-LAN scenario? And at what cost?</p>
<p>If you had routers on both ends of the fiber, with each site having its own dedicated IP zones with no overlap, you could easily setup a VPN tunnel like IPSec or Wireguard between the two routers and solve your problem.<br>
That said, if you used a "stretched L2" approach like in our scenario, it would not be easy to go back and re-segment&nbsp;all your networking, moving&nbsp;from bridging&nbsp;to&nbsp;routing traffic.<br>
You could try instead to enforce the policy that every applicative stream on your network, even print jobs, realtime video, DNS, etc. uses only a "secure" (encrypted) version of its protocol. It's certainly an impressive feat if you've managed to achieve that in a typical office environment ☺️.&nbsp;Even so, you'd likely still be interested into setting some kind of encrypted tunnel on the fiber, just in case someone sets up accidentaly some unsecure applicative stream...</p>
<p>The idea we had to solve such a problem, with the least disruption to existing networks and protocols, was to mix "802.1q trunk links" and VPN-like encryption between the two ends of the fiber. So&nbsp;instead of plugging the fiber directly into your switches, you plug them to an equipment with two network interfaces, that will on one end "swallow" all your 802.1q traffic (VLANs and all) and then transfer them over the fiber, through an encrypted tunnel, to a second "mirror" equipment that will decrypt the packets and transform them again into 802.1q frames and "spit them out" to its&nbsp;local network. This was dubbed the "wormhole" project.</p>
<h2>The quest for the encrypted trunk : MACsec</h2>
<p>If you search for ways to "encrypt/secure a 802.1q trunk" you will probably read about MACsec, aka the Cisco-designed 802.1ae standard, which on paper seems to do exactly what we want, with the added benefit that if you use MACsec-capable switches on each end of the fiber, you don't need additionnal equipements to do the secure tunneling.</p>
<p>MACsec creates point-to-point Secure Channels pairs (one for Tx, one for Rx) between two devices over an untrusted connection, using first a negotiation protocol called MKA (MACsec Key Agreement) and for example pre-shared keys (or a PKI). Over these Secure Channels, MACSec Frames are sent, which are only slightly modified Ethernet frames with their layer-3+ payload encrypted using GCM-AES-128 (or GCM-AES-256 in newer hardware). Since they are essentially Ethernet frames, MACSec can natively support 802.1q VLAN headers for example.</p>
<p>In order to test these promises, we bought a pair of the smallest Cisco switch that supports MACsec : the Catalyst 3560 CX WS-3560CX-8XPD-S, at ~1600€ each.</p>
<h3><br>
Testing MACsec</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, during our testing we found MACsec underwhelming for our LAN-to-LAN scenario.</p>
<p>First, it's difficult to find accurate MACsec documentation since it supports a variety of use cases (securing a link between a workstation and a switch, securing a link between two switches...) and as usual with Cisco, there are configuration directives that may or may not exist on a given Cisco switch, depending on its IOS image, feature level, generation, etc. So it was a bit of a pain to get it working for our trunk ports.</p>
<p>Then, we found out something that in hindsight was pretty clear in the MACsec specification&nbsp;: MACsec <em>does not hide the real MAC addresses of devices talking on your network</em> to the eavesdropping attacker. It may make sense, in order for traffic to be able go through MACsec-unaware bridges, to preserve the original MAC adresses of (for example) two computers talking to each other, but we expected to be able to see only the MAC Adresses of the two switches directly connected to the untrusted network and doing the MACsec tunnel. This could have been considered a minor inconvenience, but as MAC addresses are assigned by device manufacturers, it gives an attacker quite a good intel on what brand of computer, printer, appliances, etc. devices you have on your network, so that may help them plan a targeted attack. And if you're worried about industrial espionage, maybe you don't want your spying concurrent to know what brand of components you use on your R&amp;D VLANs either.</p>
<p>Last but not least, on several occasions during our offensive testing, we were able to mess with the MKA/MACsec traffic enough (using not-so-transparent software bridges and resetting MKA sessions on the switches ) so that half of the traffic (corresponding to one of the two secure channels) was being sent fully unencrypted, despite the <code>linksec policy must-secure</code> settings on the ports specifying to never send traffic in the clear on this interface according to Cisco documentation ("Must-Secure imposes that only MACsec encrypted traffic can flow. Hence, until the MKA session is secured, traffic is dropped."). Moreover, the switches were not reporting errors at all and happily continued sending/receiving clear traffic on MACsec must-secure interfaces. The end-user devices (laptops) had no way to know their traffic was being read, since their communications continued as usual (minus the loss of a few ICMP or UDP packets during MKA renegociation).</p>
<figure role="group">
<img alt="wireshard capture showing half the traffic in clear" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="7101fb11-ea1d-4bcb-81c4-10ca1c3fa7fb" src="https://www.synacktiv.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/pcap_macsec_clair.png">
<figcaption>Wireshark traffic capture : the ping replies are sent in clear over the MACsec link, although the ping echo requests are still sent encrypted.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This behaviour was observed with the most recent IOS firmware at that time, and although it then required both 1) an attacker on the fiber doing Man-in-the-Middle and dropping some frames, and 2) an admin action on the switch CLI itself (<code>clear mka sessions</code>), given that the MKA sessions have an expiry and must be renegociated after some time or when a port goes down, we think it's likely that there's a way to trigger that behavior only by "sitting on the wire" with no CLI access to the switch.</p>
<p>The bug tracker from Cisco showed bugs and behaviour that, although apparently not applying to our model, looked close to what we found:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bst.cisco.com/quickview/bug/CSCvx83835">"MACsec access-control must-secure is allowing the unencrypted traffic to pass through a link"</a></li>
<li><a href="https://bst.cisco.com/quickview/bug/CSCvw36505">"MACsec ports in Auth-pending state after changing to should secure policy with Empty keychain"</a></li>
<li><a href="https://bst.cisco.com/quickview/bug/CSCus74990">"MKA sessions struck in "pending" state after clear MKA sess"</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We had to drop there our experiments with our Cisco switches since the goal of this mission was to "find a reliable way to encrypt LAN to LAN fiber links at high speed", not to "break MACsec", but we may go back to it sometime in the future :)</p>
<h2>Native Linux solution : VXLAN+Wireguard</h2>
<p>Having set MACsec aside, we decided to PoC something that would use only native and well-known Linux kernel features on commodity hardware.</p>
<p>Since Wireguard is the state-of-the-art, in-kernel tunneling, was there a way to shove 802.1q L2 traffic inside a wireguard tunnel, and what speeds could be reached on customer-level hardware costing approximately the same as the Cisco switches we just tested ?</p>
<p>The "missing bit" to go from an L2 trunk to a L3 tunnel was solved by using VXLAN.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>VXLAN</h3>
<p>VXLAN is a protocol used to carry over L2 frames using UDP encapsulation (port 4789 or 8472 depending on the implementation) to a distant endpoint (called VTEP, for "VXLAN termination endpoint"). It works by hooking onto L2 forwarding tables (like on a Linux bridge), and sending to the remote VTEP the frames that must be broadcasted on the segment, along with the frames that have no local destination ("flood and learn"). The remote VTEP decapsulates the L2 frame from the UDP packet and sends it to its local network.</p>
<p>VXLAN real-world use case mostly involves "datacenter bridging", so that VMs from Datacenter 1 could behave like they are "on the same Ethernet segment" than VMs from Datacenter 2 so they can really share the same IP subnet (respond to ARP "who-has", etc).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite its name, VXLAN is only "inspired" by the concept of L2 VLANs : it is not something that will, out-of-the box, listen on a trunk port and carry 802.1q tagged frames to the remote endpoint. But it's very possible to do so using Linux wonderful networking stack ! You just need to to map each&nbsp;802.1q VLAN ID to a VXLAN "vid" and do the same thing in reverse on the other VTEP.</p>
<p>Most of the documentation you find online about injecting L2 VLAN info into a VXLAN&nbsp;tunnel has you creating a Linux bridge + a VLAN interface + a VXLAN interface <em>per VLAN </em>that&nbsp;you want to transmit.&nbsp;<br>
If you use all 4096 VLANs, or want to be able to add/drop VLANs on your network without having to do so many steps each time, you can use iproute2 commands <code>bridge</code> and <code>ip</code>&nbsp;with some recent feature flags (<code>vlan_filtering, vlan_default_pvid,&nbsp;vlan_tunnel + tunnel_info</code>)&nbsp;to spare yourself some time and have less clutter on your Linux "wormhole" boxes. The <code>vlan_default_pvid&nbsp;</code>flag is very important to be able to keep 802.1q headers "inside the bridge" and have them reach the vxlan interface where they will then be mapped to a vxlan <code>vid</code>.</p>
<p>With these commands you can have a single bridge and VXLAN interface that handles every VLAN coming its way.</p>
<pre><code># Create a Linux bridge with the right options
/sbin/ip link add br0 type bridge vlan_filtering 1 vlan_default_pvid 0 vlan_stats_enabled 1 vlan_stats_per_port 1

# Enslave the trunk eth interface (connected to the switch trunk port)
# to the bridge
/sbin/ip link set dev ${TRUNK_IFACE} master br0

# Create a vxlan interface and enslave it to the same bridge
/sbin/ip link add vxlan0 type vxlan vni ${VXLAN_DEFAULT_VNI} local ${VTEP_LOCALIP} remote ${VTEP_REMOTEIP} dstport 4789
/sbin/ip link set dev vxlan0 master br0

# Activate vlan tunneling !
/sbin/bridge link set dev vxlan0 vlan_tunnel on</code></pre>
<p>Then, adding a specific VLAN ID to the bridge so its extracted and mapped to a VXLAN vid requires these 3 commands</p>
<pre><code>/sbin/bridge vlan add vid $vid dev ${TRUNK_IFACE}
/sbin/bridge vlan add vid $vid dev vxlan0
/sbin/bridge vlan set dev vxlan0 vid $vid tunnel_info id $vid</code></pre>
<p>You can easily run a little script to do the mapping once and for all for every possible VLAN ID :</p>
<pre><code># extract vlans from trunk, map them to same vxlan vid
for vid in $(seq 2 4095); do
/sbin/bridge vlan add vid $vid dev ${TRUNK_IFACE}
/sbin/bridge vlan add vid $vid dev vxlan0
/sbin/bridge vlan set dev vxlan0 vid $vid tunnel_info id $vid
done</code></pre>

<h3>Wireguard</h3>
<p><br>
Plugging this VXLAN configuration to a wireguard tunnel is surprisingly easy. We won't be covering setting up a wireguard tunnel between two Linux hosts since there are many great resources online (and it just&nbsp;works out of the box).</p>
<p>Indeed, if you've already set up a wg0 interface over the (insecure) fiber connection, with (secure) IP addresses for both of your "wormholes", you can specify the remote peer's wireguard IP address directly as ${VTEP_REMOTEIP}. Linux in-kernel networking will then do its magic and dutifully forward over the wire your 802-1q frames, encapsulated in UDP VXLAN, and encapsulated again in UDP Wireguard.</p>
<p>Having read that, you might worry like we did at the potential performance cost of such many-levels of encapsulation and encryption on top of it.</p>

<h2>Performance&nbsp;</h2>
<p><img alt="scheme of the multiple layers of encapsulation between the wormholes" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="3c48c427-11f2-416a-b2fe-c228fc8c3a54" src="https://www.synacktiv.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/max-encap.png"></p><p>So, the final packets that will transit "on the wire" between our wormholes will end up looking something&nbsp;&nbsp;like&nbsp;<code>Eth/IP/UDP/WG/IP/UDP/VXLAN/Eth/802.1q/IP/Payload</code>. That's quite an overhead indeed!</p>
<p>But this overhead is only present during the&nbsp;transit on the fiber, which on our&nbsp;scenario is a local, short-distance (read : low latency) optical fiber, typically using at least&nbsp;10 Gbps SFP+ optical transceivers. So the latency and bandwidth should be good, and we will be able to maximize the Maximum Transfer Unit (MTU) on the fiber interface ports, so that a typical Ethernet data payload of 1500 bytes will be able to&nbsp;"sit" easily in the payload of our jumbo wireguard+vxlan frame :&nbsp;&nbsp;there will be&nbsp;no need for segmentation and retransmits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding wireguard encryption, we did a little research and felt confident after reading&nbsp;<a href="https://restoreprivacy.com/optimizations-in-wireguard-achieve-record-10gbit-sec-throughput/">resources</a> &nbsp;that we could reach high speeds with the right hardware offloads, altough 10 Gbps seemed like the "record".</p>
<p>The corresponding <code>ethtool</code> vars that matched offloads that enabled good performance for VXLAN+wireguard were determined to be :&nbsp;<code>tx-udp_tnl-segmentation,&nbsp;generic-segmentation-offload,&nbsp;generic-receive-offload,&nbsp;rx-vlan-offload</code> and&nbsp;<code>tx-vlan-offload</code>.</p>
<p>The next step was to find server hardware that had&nbsp;10 Gbps SFP+ ports with&nbsp;<strong>UDP Segmentation Offload</strong>&nbsp;(Generic Segmentation Offload),&nbsp;<strong>UDP Receive Coalescing</strong>&nbsp;(Generic Receive Offload) and <strong>VXLAN offloading</strong> capabilites</p>
<p>The search was over when we found out about SuperMicro SuperServer&nbsp;5019D-4C-FN8TP, that had everything we needed with an&nbsp;Intel Xeon D-2123IT&nbsp;SoC that directly handles 2x 10Gbps SFP+ and 2x 10Gbps base-T ports, both the CPU and NICs supporting the aforementioned offload instructions. It costed about 1300€ (you then have to add ECC RAM and local hard drive yourself).</p>
<p><img alt="picture of chosen supermicro server" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="ff622867-34b4-409c-b904-49fc587e2ef8" src="https://www.synacktiv.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/supermicro.png"></p><h3>Test setup</h3>
<p>Our test setup was like this :</p>
<p><img alt="schema of our test setup described below" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="592259de-dcc4-40cd-bac4-bb474ba78e6b" src="https://www.synacktiv.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/maquette_0.png"></p><p>We planned to measure throughput using <code>iperf3</code> in the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Between the Supermico wormholes on the untrusted fiber</li>
<li>Between the&nbsp;Supermico wormholes through the wireguard tunnel built over the untrusted fiber (to measure wireguard encryption penalty)</li>
<li>Between a pair of two 1 Gbps laptops, each on one side&nbsp;of the wormholes, to measure end-device to end-device performance</li>
<li>Between <em>two</em> pairs of such laptops, each pair on a different VLAN and simultaneously trying to use their 1 Gbps max bandwidth, just&nbsp;to be sure we were scaling... and this was quite a good intuition to do this test, as you will read further.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also measured the base performance of the four laptops with a classical setup (just the network switches linked by a trunk port, no vxlan or wireguard, no "wormholing") : they were able to reach 942 Mbps.</p>
<p>Just out-of-the box, with no particular tuning, here were the first&nbsp;tests results:</p>
<ul>
<li>9.81 Gbits/sec between the&nbsp;Supermicros on&nbsp;untrusted fiber (no crypto) - so it seems we really did buy 10 Gbps-capable NICs!&nbsp;nice</li>
<li>8.18 Gbits/sec between the Supermicros on&nbsp;wg0 (AES) - a 17% performance penalty, seemed to be expected from encrypting...</li>
<li>874 Mbits/sec between two&nbsp;laptops (compared to 942 Mbps in a classical setup) - a 8% performance "end-user" penalty, did not seem so bad</li>
<li>But only 658 Mbits/sec when there&nbsp;were 4 laptops each connected in pairs (again compared to 942 Mbps for each pair) - oops, something seemed off!&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>It looked like we were stalling somewhere around a ~1 Gbps shared bandwith for every end-user devices. Looked like a waste of our "next to 10 Gbps" bandwidth, surely there was something to do about it.</p>
<h3>Tuning Linux networking</h3>
<p>So we activated all the network-related tuning we had thought off beforehand:</p>
<pre><code># enable Jumbo frames (9000 bytes MTU) on 10 Gbps fiber
/sbin/ip li set dev ${UNTRUSTED_IFACE} mtu 9000

# https://cromwell-intl.com/open-source/performance-tuning/ethernet.html
/sbin/ip link set dev ${UNTRUSTED_IFACE} txqueuelen 13888 
/sbin/ethtool -G ${UNTRUSTED_IFACE} rx 4096 tx 4096

# setup a 8020 MTU on wg0 interface to account for the 80 bytes wireguard headers overhead
# 20-byte IPv4 header or 40 byte IPv6 header,&nbsp;8-byte UDP header&nbsp;&nbsp;4-byte type,&nbsp;4-byte key index,&nbsp;8-byte nonce,&nbsp;16-byte authentication tag)
/sbin/ip li set dev wg0 mtu 8020</code></pre>
<p>we added some <code>sysctl</code> tuning for 10Gbps ethernet as well:</p>
<pre><code># Maximum receive socket buffer size
net.core.rmem_max = 134217728 

# Maximum send socket buffer size
net.core.wmem_max = 134217728 

# Minimum, initial and max TCP Receive buffer size in Bytes
net.ipv4.tcp_rmem = 4096 87380 134217728 

# Minimum, initial and max buffer space allocated
net.ipv4.tcp_wmem = 4096 65536 134217728 

# Maximum number of packets queued on the input side
net.core.netdev_max_backlog = 300000 

# Auto tuning
net.ipv4.tcp_moderate_rcvbuf =1

# Don't cache ssthresh from previous connection
net.ipv4.tcp_no_metrics_save = 1

# If you are using jumbo frames set this to avoid MTU black holes.
net.ipv4.tcp_mtu_probing = 1</code></pre>

<p>After that we had the following test results:</p>
<ul>
<li>9.91&nbsp;Gbits/sec between the&nbsp;Supermicros on&nbsp;untrusted fiber (no crypto) - 100 Mbps better than&nbsp;9.81 Gbits/sec !</li>
<li>8.41&nbsp;Gbits/sec between the Supermicros on&nbsp;wg0 (wireguard) - more than 200 Mbps better than&nbsp;8.18 Gbits/sec !!</li>
<li>942 Mbits/sec between two&nbsp;laptops - now equivalent to the legacy setup without wormholes - yay !</li>
<li>still 658 Mbits/sec when they were 4 laptops each connected in pairs - something's still off...</li>
</ul>
<p>Having tuned everything network-related we could think of, it then occured to us that a good part of the networking ( bridging, forwarding, encapsulating) was really done in-kernel (read: "in-memory") and not on NICs. So surely some default Linux performance setting was stalling us around ~ 1 Gbps .</p>
<h3>Last tunables</h3>
<p>We then set the CPU governor to <code>performance</code> and tuned virtual memory <code>sysctl</code>s to match what RedHat's <code>tuned</code> tool does when setting the profile <code>throughput-performance</code>:</p>
<pre><code>vm.dirty_ratio = 40
vm.dirty_background_ratio = 10
vm.swappiness=10
# set cpu/power options
governor=performance
energy_perf_bias=performance
min_perf_pct=100</code></pre>
<p>And<em> lo&nbsp;and behold</em>, here were the tests results:</p>
<ul>
<li>9.86&nbsp;Gbits/sec between the&nbsp;Supermicros on&nbsp;untrusted fiber (no crypto) - bit lower than previous test</li>
<li><strong>9.71 Gbits/sec</strong> between the Supermicros on&nbsp;wg0 &nbsp;- the crypto impact was becoming negligible!</li>
<li>942 Mbits/sec between two&nbsp;laptops (still equivalent to the legacy setup without wormholes)</li>
<li>finally 942 Mbits/sec even when they were 4 laptops each connected in pairs - job done!</li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, the performance was so great we felt the need to vampire tap the&nbsp;fiber to make sure everythink was still encrypted - and it&nbsp;still was ;-)</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, we were able to build a fully open-source pair of appliances that will strongly encrypt a 10 Gbps 802.1q trunk at almost wire-speed (less than 2% performance penalty), defeating any spying vampire tapping onto the underlying network link. And this appliance costs less than a flagship smartphone.</p>
<p>This truly speaks levels about the performance of today's affordable server hardware&nbsp;and the maturity of Linux networking stack. You can chain network technologies like trunking, bridging, routing, VXLAN and Wireguard almost like you chain CLI commands in true UNIX fashion, and the kernel makes it "just work". It just takes quite a bit of time and trial &amp; error to find the right feature flags and tuning settings so you can get the most out of it. We hope this blog article will do its part as well for future researchers.</p>
