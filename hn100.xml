					<!-- PAGE_TITLE: Why Tramway SDK | Tramway Drifting and Dungeon Exploration Simulator Software Development Kit -->



<hr>

<p>
	<b>Tramway SDK</b> (heavy metal spelling –
	T̈ra̦m̊ẅa̦ÿ SD̈K) is a graphics
	package/framework/game engine that I have been working on for the past
	3 years.
</p>

<p>
	In this article I attempt to turn you against mainstream engines and I will
	explain, in detail, why Tramway SDK is not as awful as them.
</p>

<h2>
	Unreasonable system requirements due to Turbobloat
</h2>

<hr>

<p>
	Unity needs very powerful hardware and consumes enough power to burn down a
	rainforest. Godot is slightly better, but you still need relatively capable
	hardware.
</p>

<p>
	But what if all that you really want to make is just a lowpoly horror
	roguelite deckbuilder simulator? 15 year old hardware is more than capable
	of running a game like that, but not if you use a mainstream engine, due to
	Turbobloat.
</p>

<p>
	Tramway SDK can run on virtually any hardware from the last 15 years, since
	it is not Turbobloated. It doesn't even need a graphics card, since it can
	be switched to use software rasterization, making it perfect for displaying
	graphics on	toasters and fridges.
</p>

<p>
	Some might say "just get a better computer". This is why getting a better
	computer is bad:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		<h4>
			Affordance
		</h4>
		
		<p>
			A lot of people, especially from 3rd world countries are very poor
			and can't afford to buy hardware to run Turbobloat.
		</p>
	</li>
	
	<li>
		<h4>
			e-Waste
		</h4>
		
		<p>
			Producing computer chips is very bad on the environment. If modern
			software wasn't Turbobloated you would buy new hardware only when
			the previous hardware broke and wasn't repairable.
		</p>
	</li>
	
	<li>
		<h4>
			Not putting up with Turbobloat
		</h4>
		
		<p>
			Why spend money on another computer if you already have one that
			works perfectly fine? Just because of someone else's turbobloat? 
			You could buy 1000 cans of Dr. Pepper instead.
		</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<h2>
	Nodes are bad
</h2>

<hr>

<p>
	A thing should be a thing. It should not be a bunch of things pretending to
	be a single thing. With nodes you have to pretend that a collection of
	things is a single thing.
</p>

<p>
	Also when creating things with nodes, you have to go back and forth between
	node GUI and code. 
</p>

<p>
	In Tramway SDK you just subclass the Entity class and write the code. After
	that you make a level using the level editor. No going back and forth. No 
	nodes, just entities.
</p>

<h2>
	Monolithism
</h2>

<hr>

<p>
	All of the mainstream engines have a monolithic game editor. It doesn't
	matter how many features you use from it, you still have to wait 10 minutes
	for all of them to load in.
</p>

<p>
	Tramway SDK has editors, but all of them are optional. If you just want to
	use it as a framework, you can use only the C++ runtime. If you want to
	build levels, you can use only the level editor and no other GUI tool.
</p>

<p>
	Data files are stored as whitespace-seperated-values, so you could even edit
	all of the data files by hand, without using a single editor.
</p>

<h2>
	Bad graphics
</h2>

<hr>

<p>
	Most Unity games look like very bad, even with fancy shaders, normal mapping
	and other techniques.
</p>

<p>
	Look at what Tramway SDK can do with just lightmapping and Gouraud shading:
</p>

	<a target="_blank" href="https://racenis.github.io/tram-sdk/images/article/why/photorealism.png">
		<img src="https://racenis.github.io/tram-sdk/images/article/why/photorealism.png">
	</a><br>
	<i>
		This could be rendered on a Direct3D 7 level graphics card with a
		fixed-function pipeline.
	</i>
</center>

<h2>
	Quake level editors
</h2>

<hr>

<p>
	Brush based level geometry is very good and you can prototype levels with it
	very quickly. Tramway SDK has a <code>.map</code> file converter, which
	converts brushes into triangle meshes.
</p>

		<img src="https://racenis.github.io/tram-sdk/images/article/why/trenchbroom.png">
	</a><br>
	<i>Level being created in the Trenchbroom map editor.</i>
</center>

<br>

	<a target="_blank" href="https://racenis.github.io/tram-sdk/images/article/why/leveleditor.png">
		<img src="https://racenis.github.io/tram-sdk/images/article/why/leveleditor.png">
	</a><br>
	<i>Level being set up in the Tramway SDK level editor.</i>

<br>

	<a target="_blank" href="https://racenis.github.io/tram-sdk/images/article/why/inengine.png">
		<img src="https://racenis.github.io/tram-sdk/images/article/why/inengine.png">
	</a><br>
	<i>Level with lightmaps being rendered in-engine.</i>
</center>

<p>
	Wow! Look at this very fancy level. Not only can we create brush-based
	levels, we even have an input/output system like in Source to set up 
	interactions between entities in levels.
</p>

<center>
	<a target="_blank" href="https://racenis.github.io/tram-sdk/images/article/why/signals.png">
		<img src="https://racenis.github.io/tram-sdk/images/article/why/signals.png">
	</a><br>
	<i>Very fancy interaction editor.</i>
</center>

<p>
	In the future I will be implementing all of the Source logic entities, so
	that you can do visual scripting right in the level editor.
</p>

<h2>
	Framework for RPGs
</h2>

<hr>

<p>
	I think that it is very interesting to see the different kinds of games that
	can be created in a tool like RPG Maker. There's also tons of mods, even
	total conversions based on Morrowind. You can do a lot of stuff by changing
	the data, even in the RPG mechanics have already preprogrammed.
</p>

<center>
	<a target="_blank" href="https://racenis.github.io/tram-sdk/images/article/why/kitchensink.png">
		<img src="https://racenis.github.io/tram-sdk/images/article/why/kitchensink.png">
	</a><br>
	<i>Editor for the RPG framework.</i>
</center>

<p>
	Since the engine was designed to support level streaming from the very
	beginning, it should make the creation of open-world RPG-ish games very
	quick and very easy.
</p>

<center>
	<a target="_blank" href="https://racenis.github.io/tram-sdk/images/article/why/rpg.png">
		<img src="https://racenis.github.io/tram-sdk/images/article/why/rpg.png">
	</a><br>
	<i>
		Everyone always says that you "shouldn't create an open-world RPG", but
		that's just because they have never tried using the Trawmay SDK.
	</i>
</center>

<h2>
	TL; DR
</h2>

<hr>

<p>
	Tramway SDK is a game engine based on Quake/Source style entities, supports
	open-world streaming, comes with optional extensions, like the RPG framework
	that is sort like RPG Maker, but for 3D.
</p>

<p>
	This project is still in very early development. APIs are unstable, stuff
	breaks or just doesn't work, a lot of things still haven't been implemented,
	but it's getting better very quickly.

The heart of Project Digits is the new GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip, which packs enough processing power to run sophisticated AI models while being compact enough to fit on a desk and run from a standard power outlet (this kind of processing power used to require much larger, more power-hungry systems). This desktop-sized system can handle AI models with up to 200 billion parameters, and has a starting price of $3,000.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
	In a major upset, Latvian director <a href="https://variety.com/t/gints-zilbalodis/" id="auto-tag_gints-zilbalodis" data-tag="gints-zilbalodis">Gints Zilbalodis</a>‘ “<a href="https://variety.com/t/flow/" id="auto-tag_flow" data-tag="flow">Flow</a>” won the Golden Globe for best animated feature on Sunday evening. A co-production between Latvia, Belgium, and France with a modest $3.7 million budget, “Flow” made waves simply by earning a nomination in a category traditionally dominated by big-budget studio films.</p>



<p>
	While it’s handled by Sideshow and Janus Films whose track record includes the Oscar-winning “Drive My Car,” “Flow” faced an uphill battle in the Golden Globe race, competing against two Disney/Pixar blockbusters (“Inside Out 2” and “Moana 2”), a DreamWorks feature by animation legend Chris Sanders (“The Wild Robot”), a big-budget Netflix production from Oscar-winning Aardman Animations (“Wallace &amp; Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl”) and Oscar-winning director Adam Elliot’s “Memoirs of a Snail.”

	</p>






<p>
	In the film, a biblical flood has submerged everything in its path, including Cat’s home. There are no humans to be found anywhere, although their material legacy remains. Luckily for “the “Flow’s” feline protagonist, it finds refuge on a boat full of other presumably homeless animals. Together, the group sets sail on the flood waters.</p>



<p>
	“Flow’s” victory reflects how inclusive the Golden Globes have become towards independent and international titles in recent years, especially when compared to other major Hollywood awards ceremonies.</p>



<p>
	Last year, Makoto Shinkai’s “Suzume” earned a surprise nomination, and the year before, Masaaki Yuasa’s “Inu-Oh” made an unexpected but welcome appearance alongside the charming “Marcel the Shell with Shoes On” by Dean Fleischer-Camp. This year, Elliot’s Australian stop-motion film “Memoirs of a Snail” also earned a nomination.</p>



<p>
	“Flow” didn’t come from nowhere, either. Represented internationally by animation experts at Paris-based Charades (“Mirai,” “I Lost My Body,” “Chicken for Linda!”), the movie had an impeccable festival run that kicked off at Cannes, where it world premiered in Un Certain Regard and went on to win awards at Annecy, Ottawa, Guadalajara, and Melbourne film fests. The film has also already scored wins at the European Film Awards, Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards and New York Film Critics Circle Awards. On Jan. 12, it will compete for a Critics Choice Award.

	</p>




<p>
	“Flow’s” Golden Globe award is also a win for the democratization of the animation process. The film was created using Blender, a free, open-source software widely used by independent and amateur animators. This marks the first time a Blender-made production has won the Golden Globe for animated feature, proving that major success in the medium is, at least theoretically, open to all creators, not just those working in the studio system.</p>



<p>
	During his acceptance speech, Zilbalodis acknowledged the significance of his little film winning the award, not only for those involved but for the entire Latvian film industry. “This film is made by a very small young but very passionate team in a place where there isn’t a big film industry. So this is the first time that a film from Latvia has been here, so this is huge for us,” he explained.</p>



<p>
	The 31-year-old director went on to briefly discuss how the production of this film differed from his previous works and how both its on-screen and behind-the-scenes messages are especially poignant in 2025.</p>



<p>
	“This is a very personal story to me because I used to work alone. I made all my films by myself, but this time, I worked with a team, and just like the cat in ‘Flow,’ I had to learn to trust others and learn how to collaborate and overcome our differences. I think it’s very important to remember this nowadays,” he added.</p>



<p>
	Looking ahead, “Flow’s” unexpected Golden Globe win has opened up the race for the animated feature Oscar. With no clear frontrunner, pundits have previously favored “The Wild Robot” and “Wallace &amp; Gromit ” — the latter being <em>Variety</em>‘s <a href="https://variety.com/lists/2025-oscars-predictions/best-picture-6/">pick </a>as of Jan. 3 — over the more commercial or independent international contenders. A Golden Globe win for “Flow” may change some minds in that regard. </p>



<p>
	If “Flow” or any non-Disney film were to win the Oscar, it would signal the longest drought in the category for Disney. Since the creation of the animated feature Oscar in 2001, Disney/Pixar has never gone more than two years without winning. Its last win came in 2021 with “Encanto,” but the past two years saw victories for “Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio” (2022) and Hayao Miyazaki’s “The Boy and the Heron” (2023).</p>

My parents are of hardscrabble rural West Virginia and rural North Carolina origins. They barely managed to claw their way to the bottom of the middle class by the time they ended up in Virginia. Unfortunately, due to the demons passed on to them by their parents, my father was an alcoholic and my mother participated in the drinking. She ended up divorcing my father when I was 16 years old. It was only after the divorce that my parents were able to heal themselves, heal their only child, and stop the drinking, which was so destructive to our family. If the divorce hadn't forced the issue, alcohol would have inevitably destroyed us all. </p><p>My parents may not have done everything right, but they both unconditionally loved me. <strong>They taught me how to fully, deeply receive love, and the profound joy of reflecting that love upon everyone around you. </strong></p></div><p>I went on to attend public school in Chesterfield County, Virginia. In 1992 I graduated from the University of Virginia, founded by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson?ref=blog.codinghorror.com">Thomas Jefferson</a>.</p><p>During college, I worked at Safeway as a part-time cashier, earning the <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/minimum-wage/history?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">federal minimum wage</a>, scraping together whatever money I could through government Pell grants, scholarships, and other part-time work to pay my college tuition. Even with <a href="https://www.salliemae.com/blog/in-state-vs-out-of-state-tuition/?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">lower in-state tuition</a>, it was rocky. Sometimes I could barely manage tuition payments. And that was in 1992, when tuition was only $3,000 per year. It is now $23,000 per year. <a href="https://educationdata.org/average-cost-of-college-by-year?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">College tuition</a> at a state school increased by 8 times over the last 30 years.

But as I sat there in the audience among my neighbors, watching the complete story acted out in front of me by these teenagers, I slowly realized what staying gold actually meant: <a href="http://blog.asjournal.org/the-american-dream-reconsidered-the-outsiders-1967/?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer"><em>sharing</em> the American Dream</a>. </p><p>In the printed program, the director wrote:</p><blockquote>This play is a reminder that strength lies not just in overcoming hardships but in staying true to ourselves and lifting up those around us. <p>We hope you feel the raw emotions, sense the camaraderie, and <strong>connect with the enduring themes of resilience, empathy, and unity</strong>.

Its meaning can be distorted. Jimi Hendrix <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/rewinding-jimi-hendrixs-national-anthem?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">captured this distortion</a> so eloquently in his rendition of our national anthem. </p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sjzZh6-h9fM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Jimi Hendrix - The Star Spangled Banner [ National Anthem ] ( Live at Woodstock 1969 )"></iframe></figure><p>We are still trying to live up to those ideals today.

<p>Here are some starting points for longer term efforts:</p><ul><li>We can support organizations making it easier for Americans to vote for a new Congress in two years and a new president in four years. My concern is damage to our democratic institutions may happen so quickly that our votes could matter even less within the coming years.</li><li>We could fund nonprofits that have a <a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/about-us/our-methodology/ratings/?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">proven track record</a> of protecting democratic institutions.</li><li>We could found a new organization loosely based on the original <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAND_Corporation?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">RAND Corporation</a>, but modernized like <a href="https://www.leverforchange.org/?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">Lever for Change</a>. We can empower the best and brightest to determine a realistic, achievable path toward preserving the American Dream for <em>everyone,</em> working within the current system or outside it.</li><li>All states are shades of purple, not fully red or blue. We have <a href="https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/50343-national-policy-proposals-with-bipartisan-support?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">more in common on specific policies</a> than we realize. It would be very difficult to draw borders if we split. I know what divorce feels like, and we don't want this. Let's come together <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2023/09/polarization-democracy-and-political-violence-in-the-united-states-what-the-research-says?lang=en&amp;ref=blog.codinghorror.com">through our shared American Dream</a>. </li><li>We can start with change in our local communities. Vote in your own city, county, and state elections. Support local independent journalism and media. Find a local organization doing work you admire, ask what they need, and help them meet those needs. Listen to the stories of fellow volunteers, listen to the stories of the people you’re serving – that is the heart of Democracy.</li></ul><p>We've already completed the eight $1 million donations <a href="#" rel="noreferrer">listed above</a> to help those most immediately in need. Within the next five years, half of our family wealth will support longer term efforts. There is no single solution, so let's work together.

<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<blockquote>The Fermi Paradox is a contradiction between high estimates of the probability of the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations, such as in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation?ref=codinghorror.obox.agency" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Drake equation</a>, and lack of any evidence for such civilizations.<ul>
<li>There are billions of stars in the galaxy that are similar to the Sun including many billions of years older than Earth.</li>
<li>With high probability, some of these stars will have Earth-like planets, and if the Earth is typical, some might develop intelligent life.</li><li>Some of these civilizations might develop interstellar travel, a step the Earth is investigating now.</li><li>Even at the slow pace of currently envisioned interstellar travel, the Milky Way galaxy could be completely traversed in about a million years.<p>According to this line of thinking, <strong>the Earth should have already been visited by extraterrestrial aliens</strong>. In an informal conversation, Fermi noted no convincing evidence of this, nor any signs of alien intelligence anywhere in the observable universe, leading him to ask, “Where is everybody?”</p></li></ul>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<blockquote>To me, this is a compelling argument, in the same way that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_travel?ref=blog.codinghorror.com#Absence_of_time_travelers_from_the_future" rel="noreferrer">the lack of evidence of any time travellers</a> is:</blockquote><blockquote>Many have argued that the absence of time travelers from the future demonstrates that such technology will never be developed, suggesting that it is impossible. This is analogous to the Fermi paradox related to the absence of evidence of extraterrestrial life. As the absence of extraterrestrial visitors does not categorically prove they do not exist, so the absence of time travelers fails to prove time travel is physically impossible; it might be that time travel is physically possible but is never developed or is cautiously used. Carl Sagan once suggested the possibility that time travelers could be here but are disguising their existence or are not recognized as time travelers.</blockquote><p>It seems, to me at least, clear evidence that time travel is not possible, given the enormous amount of time behind us.

Small spaces, small units of time, <strong>everything gets smaller</strong>.</blockquote><p>Large is inefficient and unnecessary. Look at the history of computers: from giant to tiny and tinier. From slow to fast and faster.

But the possibly flawed assumption here is when we say that highly visible construction projects are an inevitable outcome of intelligence.&nbsp;<strong>It could be that it’s the engineering of the small, rather than the large, that is inevitable.</strong>&nbsp;This follows from the laws of inertia (smaller machines are faster, and require less energy to function) as well as the speed of light (small computers have faster internal communication). It may be – and this is, of course, speculation – that advanced societies are building small technology and have little incentive or need to rearrange the stars in their neighborhoods, for instance. They may prefer to build nanobots instead.<p>— <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040604012520/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/tech/nextnews/archive/next031104.htm" rel="noreferrer">Seth Shostak</a></p></blockquote><p>Seth delivers an excellent TED talk on this topic as well:</p><figure></figure><p>If we can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">barely see far in the universe as is</a>, there's no way we could possibly see into the infinite space and time between.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dJTU48_yghs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Her Official Trailer #1 (2013) - Joaquin Phoenix, Scarlett Johansson Movie HD"></iframe></figure><p>That is of course just my opinion, but <a href="https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/her?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">we'll see</a>.. eventually.</p>

        <p>If you haven't been able to keep up with my blistering pace of one blog post per year, I don't blame you. There's a lot going on right now. It's a busy time. But let's pause and take a moment to celebrate that Elon Musk destroyed Twitter. I <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/god-did-us-a-favor-by-destroying-twitter/?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">can't possibly say it better than Paul Ford</a> so I'll just refer you there:</p><blockquote>Every five or six minutes, someone in the social sciences publishes a PDF with a title like “Humans 95 Percent Happier in Small Towns, Waving at Neighbors and Eating Sandwiches.” When we gather in groups of more than, say, eight, it’s a disaster. Yet there is something fundamental in our nature that desperately wants to get everyone together in one big room, to “solve it.” Our smarter, richer betters (in Babel times, the king’s name was Nimrod) often preach the idea of a town square, a marketplace of ideas, a centralized hub of discourse and entertainment—and we listen. But when I go back and read Genesis, I hear God saying: “My children, I designed your brains to scale to 150 stable relationships. Anything beyond that is overclocking. You should all try Mastodon.”</blockquote><p>It's been clear for quite some time that the early social media strategery of "jam a million people in a colosseum and let them fight it out with free speech" isn't panning out, but never has it been more clear than now, under the Elon Musk regime, that <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/elon-musk-isnt-funny-bad-jokes-twitter-1234712950/?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">being beholden to the whims of a billionaire going through a midlife crisis</a> isn't exactly healthy for society. Or you. Or me. Or anyone, really.</p><p>I tried to be fair; I gave the post-Elon Twitter era a week, thinking "how bad could it possibly be?" and good lord, <em>it was so much worse than I could have possibly ever imagined</em>. It's like Elon read the Dilbert pointy-haired-manager book on management and bonked his head on every rung of the ladder going down, generating an ever-growing <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/04/elon-musk-twitter-terrible-things-hes-said-and-done?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">laundry list of terrible things no manager should ever do</a>. And he <em>kept going!</em></p><p>It's undeniably sad. I really liked Twitter, warts and all, <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/twitter-service-vs-platform/" rel="noreferrer">from 2007 onward</a>. In fact, it was the only "social network" I liked at all. Even when it became clear in the Trump era that Twitter was unhealthy for human minds, I soldiered on, gleaning what I could. I'm not alone in that; Clay Shirky's moribund signoff at the end of 2022 reflected how I felt:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2023/11/image.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1348" height="1495" srcset="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/11/image.png 600w, https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/11/image.png 1000w, https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2023/11/image.png 1348w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Indeed, Twitter was murdered at the whims of a billionaire high on Ketamine while it was (mostly) healthy, <a href="https://www.gbnews.com/news/world/elon-musk-x-twitter-purchase-daughter-jenna-musk-woke-virus?ref=blog.codinghorror.com" rel="noreferrer">because of the "trans woke virus"</a>.  </p><p>I urge you, all of you, <strong>to disavow Twitter and never look at it again</strong>. No one who cares about their mental health should be on Twitter at this point, or linking to Twitter and feeding it the attention it thrives on. We should entomb Twitter deep in concrete with this public warning on its capstone:</p><figure><img src="https://media.infosec.exchange/infosec.exchange/media_attachments/files/110/240/386/903/991/473/original/d3ff3462bf229383.png" alt="This place is not a place of honor...no highly esteemed deed is commemorated here ...nothing valued is here." loading="lazy"></figure><p>In the end, I begrudgingly realized, as did Paul Ford, that Elon unwittingly did us a favor by killing Twitter. He demonstrated <strong>the very real dangers of any platform run by a king, a dictator, a tyrant, a despot, an autocrat</strong>.

        Over the holidays I decided it's been too long since I did something
        with entirely no purpose. So without further ado, I present to you ...
        <b>Regex Chess</b>: sequence of 84,688 regular expressions that,
        when executed in order, will play a (valid; not <i>entirely</i> terrible) move given a chess board as input.
        Here, I'll show you.

<div>
            
            <p>Current executing regular expression will show here...</p>
        </div>

    

    
      <p>
        Specifically, this is the entirety of the program that is playing a move against you (no really, <a href="https://github.com/carlini/regex-chess/blob/main/main.py">I'm not kidding</a>, it really is this short):
      </p>

    
      <div><p><span>let </span><span>regex_list</span><span> = [/* a very </span><span>long</span><span> </span><span>list</span><span> of regular expressions */]</span></p>
<p><span>let </span><span>board</span><span> = </span><span>"rnbqkbnr / pppppppp / 8 / 8 / 8 / 8 / PPPPPPPP / RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1"</span><span>;</span></p>

<p><span>for</span><span> (regex of regex_list) {</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>board = re.replace(regex.pattern, regex.target)</span></p>
<p><span>}</span></p>
<p><span>display(board)</span></p>

      <p>
        By the end of this post you'll (hopefully)

      <h2>Getting Started: A Regular Expression CPU</h2>

      <p>
        So how are we going to get regular expressions to play chess?
        Well, by making a regular expression computer, of course!
        More specifically, we're going to design a Branch-Free,
        Conditional-Execution,
        Single-Instruction Multiple-Data instruction set.
        And then make a sequence of regular expressions that interpret these instructions.
        (Kind of like a GPU instruction set. And a bit of ARM.
        But a lot slower.)
        And then from there we can program our new computer to play chess.
        So let's get started.
      </p>
        

      <p>
        
        (Some people may say I have an unhealthy obsession with building
        weird computers, c.f. <a href="https://nicholas.carlini.com/writing/2021/unlimited-register-machine-game-of-life.html">my game of life computer</a>
        or my <a href="https://github.com/carlini/printf-tac-toe">printf computer</a>.
        Those people are wrong,
        and just have an unhealthy obsession with the banal and ordinary.)
       </p>
        

      <br>
  <h2>Computer Design</h2>
  
  <p>
    Let me get started by explaining how I'm going to organize the data
    that the computer is going to operate over.
    Because we're working with regular expressions,
    the current <code>state</code> of the computer is going to be represented as
    a single string containing both the program "stack", and all variables in the following format:
  </p>

  <p>%%
#stack:
top item on stack
second item on stack
....
#variable1: value 1
#variable2: value 2
...
#variablek: value k</p>

  <p>
    Each <code>instruction</code> will either manipulate some variables on the stack,
    or will read or write to a given variable. Let's look at some basic instructions.
  </p>

  <h3>Basic Stack Operations</h3>

<h4>The <code>Push</code> Instruction</h4>
<p>
  Here's the implementation of the <code>push</code> command that adds a value to the top of the stack:
</p>

<div><p><span>def</span><span> </span><span>push</span><span>(const):</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></span><span>return</span><span> [(r</span><span>"(%%\n#stack:\n)"</span><span>,</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>r</span><span>"\g&lt;1&gt;"</span><span>+const+r</span><span>"\n"</span><span>)]</span></p>
</div>

<p>
  You should read the return type of these functions as a list of tuples.
  Each tuple represents a regex transformation to apply,
  where the left element is the pattern to match, and the right element is the replacement.
</p>

<p>
  As a brief regular expression refresher.
  Each tuple in this list has two parts: the regular expression, and the replacement.
  A regular expression will <i>match</i> a string if it can find a substring of whatever it's being applied against (the <i>state</i>, in our case).
  Most characters in a regular expression match themselves, but parentheses create
  a "match group" that can be referenced later.
</p>

<p>
  The second argument is the replacement string.
  Again, most characters mean "Replace with this character",
  but special sequences like \g&lt;1&gt; are back-references that refer to previously captured groups.
  In this case, \g&lt;1&gt; references the first captured group (anything matched within the first set of parentheses)---which in this case is the "%%\n#stack:\n" header.
</p>

<p>
  So, as a result of this operation executing on the stack, we find the occurrence of
  "%%\n#stack:\n" in the state,
  and insert the constant value below that (to the top of the stack).
</p>

<p>
  Let's see this in practice. Say we start with an empty stack:
</p>

<p><span data-group="Group 1 (Matched by regex)">%%
#stack:</span></p>

<p>
  If we execute <code>push("hello")</code>, the regular expression will:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Match the pattern <code>%%\n#stack:\n</code> at the start of our state</li>
  <li>Capture this header into group 1 (the parentheses in the pattern create this capture group)</li>
  <li>Replace it with the captured group (<code>\g&lt;1&gt;</code>) followed by our constant "hello" and a newline</li>
</ul>

<p>
  This gives us:
</p>

<p><span data-group="Group 1 (Original header)">%%
#stack:</span>
hello</p>

<p>
  If we then execute <code>push("world")</code>, the same process repeats and we get:
</p>

<p><span data-group="Group 1 (Original header)">%%
#stack:</span>
world
hello</p>

<p>
  The regular expression always matches at the top of the stack area, so new items get pushed on top while preserving the existing stack contents below them.
</p>  

<h4>The <code>Pop</code> Instruction</h4>
<p>
  The <code>pop</code> instruction removes the top element from the stack:
</p>

<div><p><span>def</span><span> </span><span>pop</span><span>():</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></span><span>return</span><span> [(r</span><span>"(%%\n#stack:\n)([^\n]*)\n"</span><span>,</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>r</span><span>"\1"</span><span>)]</span></p>
</div>

<p>
  Here we start to see a few of the special operators that make regular expressions powerful.
  The [^\n] block means "match any character that isn't a newline" and the * means "match zero or more of these."
  So taken together we're looking for a line that starts with "%%\n#stack:\n",
  and then on the next line, zero or more characters that aren't a newline (so, the entire line).
  The replacement is just the first line, which has the effect of removing the second line,
  popping the top of the stack.
</p>

<p>
  Let's see how this works in practice. Say we start with this stack:
</p>

<p><span data-group="Group 1 (Stack header)">%%
#stack:</span>
<span data-group="Group 2 (Top element to pop)">world</span>
hello</p>

<p>
  When we execute <code>pop()</code>, the regular expression will:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Match the pattern beginning with <code>%%\n#stack:\n</code> (captured in group 1)</li>
  <li>Match any characters until the next newline (captured in group 2 - the "world")</li>
  <li>Replace everything matched with just group 1 (the header), effectively removing the top element</li>
</ul>

<p>
  This gives us:
</p>

<p><span data-group="Group 1 (Stack header)">%%
#stack:</span>
hello</p>


<p>
  Each pop operation removes exactly one element from the top of the stack, preserving any remaining elements below it.
</p>
  <h3>Variable &lt;-&gt; Stack Instructions</h3>

  <h4>Variable <code>Lookup</code></h4>
<p>
  To load the contents of a variable onto the top of the stack:
</p>

<div><p><span>def</span><span> </span><span>lookup</span><span>(variable):</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></span><span># Find the variable's value and push it onto the stack </span><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></span><span>return</span><span> [(r</span><span>"(%%\n#stack:)([^%]*\n#"</span><span>+variable+</span><span>": )([^</span><span>\n</span><span>]*)</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>r</span><span>"\1\n\3\2\3\n"</span><span>)]</span></p>
</div>

<p>
  This regular expression is a bit more complex than our previous ones. Let's break down what it does:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <code>[^%]*</code> matches basically any character (% only appears at the start of the program)
    and so lets us find any variable anywhere in the program.
  </li><li>The <code>[^\n]*</code> matches the variable's value by capturing everything until the end of the line</li>
  <li>The replacement creates a copy of the value and places it on top of the stack</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Let's see how this works in practice. Say we start with this state:
</p>

<p><span data-group="Group 1 (Stack header)">%%
#stack:</span>
<span data-group="Group 2 (Everything up to our variable)">#foo: hello
#bar: </span><span data-group="Group 3 (The value we want)">world</span>
#baz: 42</p>

<p>
  If we execute <code>lookup("bar")</code>, the regular expression will:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Match the stack header in group 1</li>
  <li>Match everything up to and including "#bar: " in group 2</li>
  <li>Match "world" in group 3</li>
  <li>Use these groups to reconstruct the state with the value copied to the top of the stack</li>
</ul>

<p>
  And so running the replacement will result in the following state:
</p>

<p><span data-group="Group 1 (Stack header)">%%
#stack:</span>
world
<span data-group="Group 2 (Original variable definition)">#foo: hello
#bar: </span><span data-group="Group 3 (Original value)">world</span>
#baz: 42</p>

<p>
  The lookup operation preserved the original variable and its value while also placing a copy of the value on top of the stack. This allows us to read variable values without modifying them.
</p>

  <h4>Variable <code>Assignment</code></h4>
  <p>
    Assigning to a variable presents an interesting challenge: we don't know if the variable
    already exists. We need to handle both cases: updating an existing variable or creating
    a new one.
  </p>


      <p>
        Let me show you the implementation and then I'll walk you through it case by case.
      </p>

      <div><p><span>def</span><span> </span><span>assign_pop</span><span>(varname):</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></span><span>return</span><span> [</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>(r</span><span>"(%%)\n#stack:\n([^\n]*)\n"</span><span> +</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></span><span>"([^%]*#"</span><span> + varname + r</span><span>": )[^\n]*"</span><span>,</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>r</span><span>"\1`\n#stack:\n\3\2"</span><span>),</span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>(r</span><span>"(%%)([^`]\n?#stack:\n)([^\n%]*)\n([^%]*)"</span><span>,</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>r</span><span>"\1`\2\4#"</span><span> + varname + r</span><span>": \3\n"</span><span>),</span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>(r</span><span>"%%`"</span><span>,</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>r</span><span>"%%"</span><span>)</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>]</span></p>
</div>

      <p>
        To begin let's assume the variable already exists. That is, the stack starts
        off looking like this, and assume we're calling assign_pop("bar"):
      </p>

      <p>%%
#stack:
world
#foo: hello
#bar: something
#othervar: othervalue</p>

      <p>
        When we run this regular expression list, we create the following capture groups:
      </p>
        

      <p><span data-group="Group 1 (%%)">%%</span>
#stack:
<span data-group="Group 2 (world)">world</span>
#foo: hello
<span data-group="Group 3 (#bar: )">#bar: </span>something
#othervar: othervalue</p>
  

  

  <p>
    After the replacement operation, we get this output:
  </p>

  <p><span data-group="Header">%%`</span>
#stack:
<span data-group="Stack declaration">#foo: hello
#bar: </span><span data-group="Variables">world</span>
#othervar: othervalue
  </p>

  <p>
    Now we proceed on to the next instruction, and <i>we don't match it</i> because the second regex fails if there's a back-tick after the program start %%. So nothing happens. And then finally, the third regex cleans things up for us.
  </p>
  
  
<p>
  <b>Handling Non-Existent Variables:</b>
    Let's consider what happens if the variable doesn't already exist. Again, assume we're calling <code>assign_pop("bar")</code>:
  </p>

  <p>
%%
#stack:
world
#foo: hello
#othervar: othervalue
  </p>

  <p>
    The first regex tries to match but fails because there is no "#bar" anywhere. So it doesn't do anything. But now the second regex tries to match and succeeds. It creates the following capture groups:
  </p>

  <p><span data-group="Group 1">%%</span>
<span data-group="Group 2">#stack:
world</span>
<span data-group="Group 3">#foo: hello
#othervar: othervalue</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    From here, we perform the rewrite and get the following output:
  </p>

  <p>
%%
#stack:
#foo: hello
#bar: world
#othervar: othervalue
  </p>

<p>
  And then the third regex is applied and does nothing.
</p>

<p>
  There are lots of instructions that use this trick to make sure we don't
  apply things in the order we don't want. For example, as an exercise for
  yourself, try to understand how the "is equal" instruction works:
</p>

<div><p><span>def</span><span> </span><span>eq</span><span>():</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></span><span>return</span><span> [</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>(r</span><span>"(%%\n#stack:\n)([^\n]*)\n\2\n"</span><span>,</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>r</span><span>"\1`True\n"</span><span>),</span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>(r</span><span>"(%%\n#stack:\n)([^`][^\n]*)\n([^\n]*)\n"</span><span>,</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>r</span><span>"\1False\n"</span><span>),</span></p>

</div>

<br>
<h2>(Branch-Free) Conditionals</h2>

<p>
  Programming languages, in order to be interesting, usually need to have some kind of
  control flow. It's very hard to write some program without ever having an if statement.
  So let's now show how we're going to do this.
  (And I hope you did your homework, because we're going to use the
  same conditional execution trick again!)
  Here's the implementation of a conditional instruction:
</p>

<div><p><span>def</span><span> </span><span>cond</span><span>(tag):</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></span><span>return</span><span> [(r</span><span>"%(%\n#stack:\nTrue)"</span><span>,</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>r</span><span>"%\1`"</span><span>),</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>(r</span><span>"%(\n#stack:\nFalse)"</span><span>,</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>tag+r</span><span>"\1`"</span><span>),</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>(r</span><span>"\n(True|False)`\n"</span><span>,</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></span><span>"</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>)]</span></p>
</div>

<p>
  Let's walk through how this is going to work, starting with the case where the
  top of the stack is False.
</p>

<p>%%
#stack:
False
#variable: value</p>

<p>
  Initially, the first regex will fail to match, because the top element on the stack
  isn't True. So we go to the next regex, and see if it applies. This one does match,
  and makes the corresponding match groups.
</p>

<p><span data-group="Group 1 (Initial state)">%%
#stack:
False</span>
#variable: value</p>


<p>
  After we apply the replacement, we get the following stack.
</p>

<p>%tag
#stack:
False`
#variable: value</p>

<p>
  (And finally, using the same cleanup trick, we'll remove the used marker.)
</p>

<p>
  Now see what happened here? The program <i>no longer begins with <code>%%</code></i>.
  This means that EVERY instruction will fail to match, because they always make sure
  that the program begins with %%. So nothing else will happen.... until we <i>reactivate</i>
  it later with the following simple instruction:
</p>



<div><p><span>def</span><span> </span><span>reactivate</span><span>(tag):</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span>return</span><span> [(r</span><span>"%"</span><span>+tag+r</span><span>"\n([^%]*)"</span><span>,</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>r</span><span>"%%\n\1"</span><span>)]</span></p></div>

<p>
  Let's now return to the True case for the conditional. This is the easy case: we
  basically don't do anything at all. We replace the stack with True` on the second
  regex, and then delete this line on the third. Easy.
</p>

<p>
        Notice that this means our code is actually branch-free,
        because every instruction is a conditional instruction. (Kind of like ARM's predicated execution, where most instructions can be conditionally executed based on status flags rather than using explicit branch instructions.)</p>
        
        
      <br>
      <h3>Loops (are impossible)</h3>

      <p>
        Because our program just consists of a sequence of regular expressions,
        you can't loop at all! That, technically, means we can't actually perform
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness">Turing Complete</a>
        But we can do any bounded computation by just <i>unrolling</i> any loops we may have.
        And fortunately computing the next move in a chess position is a bounded computation, so we can do just that. 
      </p>
        
        
      <h2>Single-Instruction Multiple-Data</h2>

<p>
  And now for my absolute favorite part of the language we've developed.
  By the magic of regular expressions (and the fact that they perform
  substitution globally over the entire string), we can run multiple <i>threads</i>
  simultaneously!
</p>

<p>
  That is, if we just write our state string as:
</p>

<p><span data-group="Group 1 (First thread header)">%%
#stack:</span>
<span data-group="Group 2 (First operand)">int0000101010</span>
<span data-group="Group 3 (Second operand)">int0001011100</span>
<span data-group="Group 1 (Second thread header)">%%
#stack:</span>
<span data-group="Group 2 (First operand)">int0000001101</span>
<span data-group="Group 3 (Second operand)">int0110000000</span></p>

<p>
  When we call <code>binary_add()</code>, both additions happen simultaneously! After execution:
</p>

<p>%%
#stack:
int0010001110
%%
#stack:
int0110001101</p>

<p>
  The reason this happens is because the regular expression matches work globally. When we match the "begin thread"
  operator (<code>%%</code>) twice, we get to perform operations on both threads simultaneously.
</p>

<p>
  So how do we actually make use of this feature? Let's look at some instructions that help us create and manage threads.
</p>

<br>
<h3>The Fork Instructions</h3>

<p>
  Here's a simple fork instruction that splits every currently running thread into two, 
  with the second one starting off inactive with a given tag:
</p>

<div><p><span>def</span><span> </span><span>fork_inactive</span><span>(tag):</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></span><span>return</span><span> [(r</span><span>"%%\n([^%]*)"</span><span>,</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>r</span><span>"%%\n\1"</span><span> + </span><span>"%"</span><span>+tag+r</span><span>"\n\1"</span><span>)</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>]</span></p>
</div>

<p>
  We can also, for example, <code>fork()</code> on a boolean, giving one thread
  the True case and another the False case. (This is something like McCarthy's
  Amb operator <a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0049237X08720184">reference</a>)
</p>

<div><p><span>def</span><span> </span><span>fork_bool</span><span>(variable):</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></span><span>return</span><span> [(r</span><span>"%%\n([^%]*)"</span><span>,</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>r</span><span>"%%\n\1#"</span><span>+variable+r</span><span>": True\n%%\n\1#"</span><span>+variable+r</span><span>": False\n"</span><span>)</span></p></div>

<p>
  Let's see what happens when we apply multiple forks. Starting with a simple state:
</p>

<p><span data-group="Group 1 (Thread content)">%%
#stack:
somevalue
#x: 10</span></p>

<p>
  After calling <code>fork_bool("condition")</code>, we get:
</p>

<p>%%
#stack:
somevalue
#x: 10
#condition: True
%%
#stack:
somevalue
#x: 10
#condition: False</p>

<p>
  If we then call <code>fork_bool("c2")</code>, each existing thread splits into two:
</p>

<p>%%
#stack:
somevalue
#x: 10
#condition: True
#c2: True
%%
#stack:
somevalue
#x: 10
#condition: True
#c2: False
%%
#stack:
somevalue
#x: 10
#condition: False
#c2: True
%%
#stack:
somevalue
#x: 10
#condition: False
#c2: False</p>

<p>
  Now we have four simultaneous execution paths, exploring every possible combination of our boolean conditions at the same time.
  This is exceptionally useful for chess, when we might frequently want to consider multiple
  possible board states at the same time, and (for example) score them to see which is best.
  Instead of having to loop over every possible board state, we can just pretend we were doing it
  once but have them all happen at the same time.
</p>

        
        
<br>
<h2>Compiling to our little language</h2>

<p>
  Now that we have our CPU emulator, we can build a compiler to target our new assembly
  language.
</p>

<p>
  <i>"But wait I'm not reading this post for a lesson in compilers!"</i> you say??
  Fair point.
  Also I didn't go into this project trying to build a compiler,
  so instead what I have is more of a macro-assembler.
  It turns python-ish programs like this:
</p>

<div><p><span>def</span><span> </span><span>fib</span><span>():</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></span><span>a</span><span> = 1</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></span><span>b</span><span> = 2</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></span><span>for</span><span> _ </span><span>in</span><span> </span><span>range</span><span>(10):</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></span><span>next</span><span> = a + b</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></span><span>a</span><span> = b</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></span><span>b</span><span> = </span><span>next</span></p>
</div>

<p>
  Into a sequence of instructions like this:
</p>

<p>push(1)
assign_pop('a')
push(2) 
assign_pop('b')
lookup('a')
lookup('b')
binary_add()
assign_pop('next')
lookup('b')
assign_pop('a')
lookup('next')
assign_pop('b')
[... repeated 8 more times ...]
</p>

<br>
<h3>Compiling Through Symbolic Execution</h3>

<p>
  Rather than writing a traditional compiler with parsing and code generation
  phases, I took an unusual approach: symbolic execution. The key insight is
  that we can "execute" the Python code in a special way that records what
  operations would happen rather than actually performing them.
</p>

<p>
  Here's how it works: the <code>variables</code> argument isn't actually a
  dictionary---it's a special object that records every operation performed on
  it. It creates what we call a "trace" of the execution. When you write:
</p>

<p>a = b + 1</p>

<p>
  The tracer object records four operations:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>A <code>lookup</code> of variable 'b'</li>
  <li>A <code>push</code> of the constant 1</li>
  <li>A <code>binary_add</code> operation</li>
  <li>An <code>assign_pop</code> to variable 'a'</li>
</ol>

<br>
<h3>Handling Control Flow</h3>

<p>
  The trickiest part of this approach is handling branching control flow---<code>if</code> statements, specifically.
  (What about loops? We don't have those, so I never use them. Loops can only have constants.)
  We need to make sure we capture all possible execution paths. Here's how we do it:
</p>

<p>
  When we hit a conditional, we create two separate paths in our trace---one for when the condition is true, and one for when it's false. Each path records its own sequence of operations. Later, we merge these paths back together.
</p>

<p>
  For example, this Python code:
</p>

<div><p><span>if</span><span> x &gt; 0:</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></span><span>y</span><span> = 1</span></p>
<p><span>else</span><span>:</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></span><span>y</span><span> = 2</span></p>
</div>

<p>
  Generates something like this trace structure:
</p>

<p>lookup('x')      # Get x's value
push(0)          # Push 0
greater_than()   # Compare
cond('tag1')     # Branch on result
  # True path:
  push(1)
  assign_pop('y')
pause('tag2')
reactivate('tag1')
  # False path:
  push(2)
  assign_pop('y')
reactivate('tag2')</p>

<p>
  The magic of the compiler lies in how it handles control flow through branching.
  Let me explain this in a little bit more detail.
</p>

<p>
  When our compiler first starts processing code, it maintains a single linear
  path of instructions in the CallTree. Each instruction gets appended one after
  another as we go. This list of instructions looks entirely linear.
  When we   reach a conditional statement, though, things get interesting.
</p>

<p>
  Consider what happens when we hit a conditional statement like the <code>x &gt; 0</code>
  conditional above.
  When this happens, I detect it, and create a branch in the call tree representing the two
  paths simultaneously.
  Then, I just pretend this conditional was true, and fill out the true case of the tree.
  When we reach the end of the program we've done <i>some</i> of our compilation, but not all of it.
</p>


<p>
  Now comes the clever part.
  When compiling, we don't just trace the program once.
  We trace many times.
  And each time we trace, we arrange for the conditionals to go through whichever branch has been
  taken least often.
  In this way, the second time around, we record the instructions for the false branch.
</p>

      <p>
        Finally, once the conditional is over, we detect this and merge the two branches back together.
  This branching and merging mechanism is more than just a clever trick---it's essential to how our regex-based CPU actually works. When we convert this tree into instructions, each branch gets translated into a conditional regex operation (using our cond instruction) that can selectively activate and deactivate different parts of our program state. The merge points become reactivate instructions that ensure we continue execution on the correct path.
</p>

<br>
      <h2>Writing a Chess Engine</h2>

      <p>
        Okay, so we're finally to the part of this post where we can actually start writing
        a chess engine. (And at the part where some of the emulator design decisions will
        make sense.)
      </p>

      <p>
        For the most part, this is entirely straightforward and mirrors how you would write a chess
        engine in any other programming language.
        But this branching thing with SIMD is what gives us the power to make things go fast.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let's consider the following (simplified) program that calculates
        all the valid pawn moves.
      </p>


<div><p><span>def</span><span> </span><span>pawn_moves</span><span>(initial_board):</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></span><span># Step 1: Find all pawns and create a list of their positions<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></span><span>pawnpos_list</span><span> = find_all_pawns(initial_board)</span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></span><span># Step 2: Create parallel states for each pawn (up to 8) </span><span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></span><span>MAX_PAWNS</span><span> = 8</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></span><span>for</span><span> iteration </span><span>in</span><span> </span><span>range</span><span>(MAX_PAWNS):</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>not</span><span> pawn_list.is_empty():</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></span><span>pawn_pos</span><span> = pawnpos_lst.remove_first()</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>fork_inactive(</span><span>"waiting"</span><span>)</span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></span><span># Step 3: Switch to processing the parallel states </span><span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>reactivate(</span><span>"inactive"</span><span>)</span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></span><span># Step 4: Generate moves for all pawns simultaneously<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span> </span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></span><span>candidate_moves</span><span> = []</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></span><span>if</span><span> initial_board[pawn_pos + (0, 1)].is_empty():</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>candidate_moves.append(pawn_pos + (0, 1))</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></span><span>if</span><span> pawn_pos.y == 2:</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></span><span>if</span><span> initial_board[pawn_pos + (0, 2)].is_empty():</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>candidate_moves.append(pawn_pos + (0, 2))</span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></span><span>if</span><span> initial_board[pawn_pos + (1, 1)].has_opponent():</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>candidate_moves.append(pawn_pos + (1, 1))</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></span><span>if</span><span> initial_board[pawn_pos + (-1, 1)].has_opponent():</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>candidate_moves.append(pawn_pos + (-1, 1))</span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></span><span># Step 5: Switch back and merge results<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span> </span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>pause(</span><span>"inactive"</span><span>)</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>reactivate(</span><span>"main"</span><span>)</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></span><span>candidate_moves</span><span> = merge_variables_from_threads(</span><span>"inactive"</span><span>)</span></p>
</div>

<h3>Step 1: Finding the Pawns</h3>
<p>
  The <code>find_all_pawns()</code> function scans through our board representation,
  looking for white pawns (represented as 'P' in the FEN string).
  It returns a list of the position of each of these pawns.
  As an example, if we run our program on the following
  position with three pawns on d2, e2, and f2, this creates a semicolon-separated list in the pawnpos_lst variable as follows
</p>

<p>%%
#stack:
#board: 4k3/8/8/8/8/8/3PPP2/4K3
#pawnpos_lst: d2;e2;f2;</p>

<h3>Step 2: State Creation</h3>
<p>
  Now comes the clever part. The <code>fork_inactive</code> instruction, as described above, duplicates our entire program state. Each time it runs, it creates an exact copy of the currently running thread, but marks the new copy with %waiting instead of %%. (Recall this means instructions won't apply to this thread.) At the same time, it takes one position from our pawnpos_lst and assigns it to a new variable pawnpos in the copied state.
</p>

<p>
  When our loop runs three times, each <code>fork_inactive</code> operation splits off a new parallel universe where we'll process a different pawn. The regex operation that does this copying preserves all existing variables but adds the new pawnpos variable with the specific position for that copy to process.
</p>

<p>%%
#stack:
#board: 4k3/8/8/8/8/8/3PPP2/4K3
#pawnpos_lst: 

%waiting
#stack:
#board: 4k3/8/8/8/8/8/3PPP2/4K3
#pawnpos: d2

%waiting
#stack:
#board: 4k3/8/8/8/8/3PPP2/4K3
#pawnpos: e2

%waiting
#stack:
#board: 4k3/8/8/8/8/3PPP2/4K3
#pawnpos: f2</p>

<h3>Step 3: Activation Switch</h3>
<p>
  Recall that the pause and reactivate operations work by manipulating the %% markers that indicate which states are active. The pause("main") operation changes our original %% to %main, effectively deactivating it. Then reactivate("inactive") finds all states marked with %waiting and changes them to %%, making them the new active states.
</p>

<h3>Step 4: Parallel Move Generation</h3>
<p>
  Here's where the SIMD magic happens. Each check for a possible move---forward one square, forward two squares, or diagonal captures---executes across all active states simultaneously. When we check if the square ahead is empty, we're actually checking d3, e3, and f3 all in one operation. For each valid move, we add this to the candidate_moves list. 
</p>

<p>
  (I've significantly simplified the program for visual purposes here. In
  reality I don't work directly over the FEN strings but expand them to 64
  independent variables for each of the 64 squares and read and write to these
  squares directly. This makes processing the board state much easier. But for
  the purpose of this blog post it's easier to show visually as if it worked on FEN strings alone.)
</p>

<p>%main
#stack:
#board: 4k3/8/8/8/8/8/3PPP2/4K3
#pawnpos_lst: 

%%
#stack:
#board: 4k3/8/8/8/8/8/3PPP2/4K3
#pawnpos: d2
#candidate_moves: d3;d4

%%
#stack:
#board: 4k3/8/8/8/8/8/3PPP2/4K3
#pawnpos: e2
#candidate_moves: e3;e4

%%
#stack:
#board: 4k3/8/8/8/8/8/3PPP2/4K3
#pawnpos: f2
#candidate_moves: f3;f4</p>

<h3>Step 5: Merging Results</h3>
<p>
  The final merge operation combines all the candidate_moves lists from our parallel states. It first switches activation back to the main state using pause and reactivate. Then merge_variables_from_threads (again, a pseudo-op I've made up for visual clarity, in practice this requires like 10 different instructions on my real machine) match all the candidate_moves lists across our inactive states and concatenates them together.
</p>

<p>
  What this means is that while the code we wrote code <i>looks</i> like it processes one pawn at a time, our regex engine's ability to process multiple states means we're actually handling all pawns simultaneously. Every operation, from checking empty squares to building move lists, happens in parallel across all our active states.
</p>

      <p>
        And this is how every piece operation works.
        Because this post is already getting quite long, I won't walk through each piece one by one, but if you're interested definitely go look at the <a href="https://github.com/carlini/regex-chess/blob/main/chess_engine.py">chess-engine.py</a> for the details.

<h2>Playing a Turn</h2>

<p>
  Now let's walk through the overall game loop that handles everything.

<p>
  Say we're at the start of a game, and the human enters "e2e4" (the king's pawn opening).
  Here's how our code processes this:
</p>

<h3>Step 1: Reading the Move</h3>

<p>
  Initially, the function <code>from_pretty_utf8_to_fen()</code> converts our pretty-printed
  board with Unicode chess pieces back into FEN notation.
  It also extracts the source and destination squares from the input:
</p>

<p>%%
#stack:
#board: rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR
#src: e2
#dst: e4</p>

<h3>Step 2: Move Validation</h3>

<p>
  Now we need to check if this is a valid move.
  Rather than writing entirely new code that explicitly checks if a move is legal,
  we use our parallel processing power again.
  The process works in three stages:
</p>

<p>
  First, <code>make_move</code> applies the human's move to create a new board state:
</p>

<p>%%
#stack:
#board: rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR
#after_move: rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR</p>

<p>
  Then <code>compute_legal_boards</code> generates <i>all</i> possible legal moves from the starting position, creating a list like:
</p>

<p>%%
#stack:
#next_boards: rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR;
              rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/3P4/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR;
              rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR;
              ...</p>

<p>
  Finally, fork_on_list creates parallel states for each legal board position:
</p>

<p>%%
#stack:
#board: rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR

%%
#stack:
#board: rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/3P4/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR

%%
#stack:
#board: rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR</p>

<p>
  The <code>destroy_active_thread()</code> call removes any thread where the board doesn't match after_move.
  In our case, only the e2-e4 position survives, confirming it's a legal move.
  (If no legal move is made, I have a special regex that will replace the entire output with just the hard-coded text "Illegal Move.")
</p>

<h3>Step 3: Computer's Reply</h3>

<p>
  Now we repeat a similar process to find the best reply.
  First, <code>compute_and_score_legal_boards</code> generates all possible black responses.
  This function does a little bit of magic,
  and when it returns the next possible boards, it returns with each board
  <i>the score of that board after whites next best move</i>
  I'll explain how this works below. But suffice to know that what this function returns for
  now the possible positions as <code>compute_legal_boards</code> does, but also the score of the position.
        (This is where the MiniMax happens.
        The score here is how good each position is from the player's perspective, after they have
        made their best reply move.)
      </p>

<o>
  So running this function gives us something like this as output


<p>%%
#stack:
#board: rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR
#score: 100

%%
#stack:
#board: rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR
#score: 102

%%
#stack:
#board: rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR
  #score: 98</p>


<p>
  <code>keep_best_scoring_board(score)</code> collapses these parallel states,
  but this time keeping only the position with the highest score according to black (in this example, the f7-f5 response).
  This is the second half of the minimax search---the one where we look at all of the options where our
  opponent had a pick the first time around, and now we pick among these the best for us.
  Finally, from_fen_to_pretty_utf8 converts this position back to the pretty Unicode display format.
  As a result, I never have to build any explicit search algorithms or lists to store lists of positions,
  that's all handled by the parallel processing.
</p>

<br>
<h2>MiniMax Search (for free)</h2>
  
      <p>
        The final missing piece of this process is how to implement the <code>compute_and_score_legal_boards</code>
      function in a way that gets us the depth-2 minimax search.
      And here I cheat (a lot).
      </p>

<p>
  It is relatively easy to generate <i>pseudo-</i>legal moves---that is, moves that are basically legal, but might leave the king in check.
  In chess this isn't allowed (you can't end your turn in check) and so the second thing that has to happen
  is I have to delete all of the moves that would leave the king in check.
</p>

<p>
  The way to do this is to again generate all possible opponent replies and see if any of them would possible "capture" the king. If they would, then the position is illegal because that's the definition of check.
  But what this means is we're already doing a depth-2 search.
  We have our initial board state.
  Depth 1, we generate all possible moves the computer wants to make.
  Then depth 2, we generate all possible moves the opponent could make to ensure we're not in check.
</p>

<p>
  All I have to do now then is score each of these opponent-generated moves and return the score of the candidate
  position as the best scoring among all of these (from the perspective of the opponent).
  And then I can just take the best scoring of these (from the persepctive of the computer) as its best move
</p>

<p>
  Now there's one slight problem here, which is why real chess engines don't do this.
  And that is this isn't technically a full depth-2 minimax search because it would allow the opponent
  moves generated in reply to be illegal because they could put their king in check.
  So doing this fully correctly would require a depth-3 search, which would significantly increase
  the cost of the search.
  So I just don't do that.
</p>

<p>
  Importantly, the computer will never generate an illegal reply.
  This just means that, in some cases, the reply it generates won't be quite as strong as if it had
  done a full depth-2 minimax search because it might assume the opponent could make an illegal move.
</p>


<br>
<h2>Everything Else</h2>
      <p>
        There's a lot more that goes into the program than this. If you're curious I'd encourage you to read through the source
        code on <a href="https://github.com/carlini/regex-chess">GitHub</a>.
        Among the things I think are particularly interesting that I didn't talk about here:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>How to parallelize move generation for sliding pieces like bishops, rooks, and queens all at exactly the same time</li>
        <li>How castling is implemented with a specialized "is this square under attack" procedures</li>
        <li>Conversion to and from the FEN chess board to one has a single variable per square</li>
        <li>Detection of castling rights by tracking the king and rook positions</li>
        <li>The implementation of en passant capture detection and tracking</li>
        <li>An extensive 2000 lines of tests, validating the correctness of the engine over several thousand games</li>
      </ul>
        
        
      <br>
      <h2>Some Performance Tricks</h2>

      <p>
        Before I leave you, I thought I'd describe a few fun performance optimizations I made.
        My initial code would take roughly 30 minutes to generate a single human reply---perfect for chess by mail, less perfect for chess by browser.
        The final code, on my machine, takes somewhere between one and ten seconds depending on the position.
        So I managed about a factor of 100 speedup by making sure I got all the details right.
      </p>

      <p>
        (I've already shown you my favorite performance trick: parallel processing.
        Now I'll tell you a few more.)
      </p>

      <br>
      <h3>Delete Intermediate Variables</h3>

      <p>
        One of the biggest performance killers in the initial implementation was keeping
        too many intermediate variables around. Every variable lookup requires scanning
        through the entire state string to find the variable's value - an O(n) operation.
        Additionally, when we fork execution states, we need to copy all these variables,
        which bloats our memory usage significantly.
      </p>

      <p>
        By aggressively deleting variables as soon as they're no longer needed,
        and reusing variable names where possible, I was able to dramatically reduce
        both the computation time and memory usage. Evaluating a single move now
        takes about 300MB of internal state, down from 10GB in the unoptimized version.
      </p>
      
      <br>
      <h3>Fast Regex Matching</h3>
      <p>
        Recall earlier that I defined the conditional operator like this
      </p>

      <div><p><span>def</span><span> </span><span>cond</span><span>(tag):</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></span><span>return</span><span> [(r</span><span>"%(%\n#stack:\nTrue)"</span><span>,</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>r</span><span>"%\1`"</span><span>),</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>(r</span><span>"%(\n#stack:\nFalse)"</span><span>,</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>tag+r</span><span>"\1`"</span><span>),</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>(r</span><span>"\n(True|False)`\n"</span><span>,</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></span><span>"</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>)]</span></p>
</div>

      <p>
        Why do you think the third regex is written this way? Wouldn't it just be shorter
        if it was like this instead:
      </p>
        
      <div><p><span>def</span><span> </span><span>cond</span><span>(tag):</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></span><span>return</span><span> [(r</span><span>"%(%\n#stack:\nTrue)"</span><span>,</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>r</span><span>"%\1`"</span><span>),</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>(r</span><span>"%(\n#stack:\nFalse)"</span><span>,</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>tag+r</span><span>"\1`"</span><span>),</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>(r</span><span>"(True|False)`\n"</span><span>,</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></span><span>""</span><span>)]</span></p></div>

      <p>
        Notice the missing newline <code>\n</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        As it turns out, the first version actually improves the efficiency of this
        instruction by a factor of two! By changing just one character!
        The reason for this is due to the details about how regular expressions work
        and how they're matched.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are going to be lots of True/False strings all throughout the code.
        But most of them will be part of variables, and not the top element on the stack.
        By requiring the preceding newline and "#stack:\n" prefix in our pattern,
        we ensure the regex engine can quickly skip over all the True/False strings
        that appear in variable names or values. This dramatically reduces the number
        of attempted matches the regex engine needs to make.
      </p>
        
      <br>
      <h3>Writing Special-Purpose Instructions</h3>

      <p>
        Sometimes it's worth writing specialized instructions rather than composing existing ones.
        For example, one of the slowest parts of the initial implementation was in a loop that scanned
        each of the squares to find all pieces of a given type. This required a bunch of conditionals,
        and within each conditional, a bunch of stack operations.
        But you can just smash the entire loop body into a single regex instruction:
      </p>

      <div><p><span>def</span><span> </span><span>do_piece_assign</span><span>(piece_chr, piece, x, y, pos):</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></span><span>return</span><span> [(f</span><span>"%%([^%]*#</span><span>{pos}</span><span>: </span><span>{piece_chr}</span><span>[^%]*)"</span><span> +</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>f</span><span>"#</span><span>{piece}</span><span>x_lst: ([^</span><span>\n</span><span>]*)</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span> +</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>f</span><span>"#</span><span>{piece}</span><span>y_lst: ([^</span><span>\n</span><span>]*)</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span> +</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>f</span><span>"#</span><span>{piece}</span><span>pos_lst: ([^</span><span>\n</span><span>]*)</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>fr</span><span>"%%\1#</span><span>{piece}</span><span>x_lst: </span><span>{x}</span><span>;\2\n"</span><span> +</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>fr</span><span>"#</span><span>{piece}</span><span>y_lst: </span><span>{y}</span><span>;\3\n"</span><span> +</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>fr</span><span>"#</span><span>{piece}</span><span>pos_lst: </span><span>{pos}</span><span>;\4\n"</span><span>)]</span></p></div>

      <p>
        The final major optimization comes from maximizing how much we can do in parallel.
        Remember that our regex engine can process multiple states simultaneously---this means
        that instead of generating moves one at a time, we can generate them all at once.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, when generating rook moves, instead of checking each direction
        sequentially, we can fork eight parallel states---one for each possible direction.
        (Notice that "up" and "down" are different directions.)
        Each state then moves its rook as far as it can go in that direction. This turns
        what would be a loop into a single parallel operation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Similarly, when evaluating positions, instead of scoring one position at a time,
        we create parallel states for each candidate position and evaluate them all simultaneously.
        This parallel evaluation is particularly effective because most of our operations
        (like counting piece values) work identically across all states.
      </p>

      <br>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>

      <p>
        What do you want out of a conclusion to a blog post like this?
        I don't really have much to conclude.
        I guess I'll just say that
        I think more people should do entirely pointless things like this.
        It's a lot of fun,
        no one cares how long it takes you to finish,
        no one cares if it works or not,
        and incidentally, it teaches you more than you wanted to know about
        dozens of areas of computer science outside your field.
      </p>

      <p>
        I hope to have a few more entirely pointless things like this coming later this year.
        If you liked this sort of thing, you might find it fun to read this other article I wrote
        about <a href="https://github.com/carlini/printf-tac-toe">how to play tic-tac-toe</a>
        using C's <code>printf</code> statement,
        or how I wrote <a href="https://nicholas.carlini.com/writing/2019/javascript-doom-clone-13k.html">a Doom clone in 13kB of JavaScript</a>.

All of the RTX 50-series cards are PCIe Gen 5 and include DisplayPort 2.1b connectors to drive displays up to 8K and 165Hz. </p><p>Surprisingly, the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-gb%2Fgeforce%2Fgraphics-cards%2F50-series%2Frtx-5090%2F">RTX 5090 Founders Edition</a> will be a two-slot GPU and will be capable of fitting inside small form factor PCs — a big departure from the size of the RTX 4090. The RTX 5090 has 32GB of GDDR7, a memory bandwidth of 1,792GB/sec, and a massive 21,760 CUDA cores. </p><p>This all adds up to a GPU that Nvidia says will be two times faster than the RTX 4090, thanks to DLSS 4 and the Blackwell architecture. But it will come at a cost of power consumption, as Nvidia says the RTX 5090 will have a total graphics power of 575 watts and a recommended PSU requirement of 1000 watts. That’s 125 watts more than the RTX 4090, but hopefully the RTX 5090 will be a lot more power efficient so that you’ll rarely be using the full 575 watts.</p><p>Nvidia demonstrated <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> running on an RTX 5090 with DLSS 4 at 238fps compared to 106fps on an RTX 4090 with DLSS 3.5. Both GPUs are running the game with full ray tracing enabled.</p><p><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-gb%2Fgeforce%2Fgraphics-cards%2F50-series%2Frtx-5080%2F">The RTX 5080</a> is designed to be twice as fast as the RTX 4080 and will include 16GB of GDDR7 memory, a memory bandwidth of 960GB/sec, and 10,752 CUDA cores. The RTX 5080 will have a total graphics power of 360 watts and Nvidia is recommending a 850-watt power supply. Nvidia is promising big performance gains with the RTX 5080 over the previous RTX 4080 model as a result of these specs.</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom"

RTX 50-series laptops will be available starting in March from a variety of PC makers.</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="RTX 50-series laptops are coming in March." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2400x1260/376x197/filters:focal(1200x630:1201x631):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25820645/geforce_rtx_50_series_laptops_key_visual.jpg 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2400x1260/384x202/filters:focal(1200x630:1201x631):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25820645/geforce_rtx_50_series_laptops_key_visual.jpg 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2400x1260/415x218/filters:focal(1200x630:1201x631):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25820645/geforce_rtx_50_series_laptops_key_visual.jpg 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2400x1260/480x252/filters:focal(1200x630:1201x631):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25820645/geforce_rtx_50_series_laptops_key_visual.jpg 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2400x1260/540x284/filters:focal(1200x630:1201x631):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25820645/geforce_rtx_50_series_laptops_key_visual.jpg 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2400x1260/640x336/filters:focal(1200x630:1201x631):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25820645/geforce_rtx_50_series_laptops_key_visual.jpg 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2400x1260/750x394/filters:focal(1200x630:1201x631):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25820645/geforce_rtx_50_series_laptops_key_visual.jpg 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2400x1260/828x435/filters:focal(1200x630:1201x631):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25820645/geforce_rtx_50_series_laptops_key_visual.jpg 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2400x1260/1080x567/filters:focal(1200x630:1201x631):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25820645/geforce_rtx_50_series_laptops_key_visual.jpg 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2400x1260/1200x630/filters:focal(1200x630:1201x631):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25820645/geforce_rtx_50_series_laptops_key_visual.jpg 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2400x1260/1440x756/filters:focal(1200x630:1201x631):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25820645/geforce_rtx_50_series_laptops_key_visual.jpg 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2400x1260/1920x1008/filters:focal(1200x630:1201x631):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25820645/geforce_rtx_50_series_laptops_key_visual.jpg 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2400x1260/2048x1075/filters:focal(1200x630:1201x631):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25820645/geforce_rtx_50_series_laptops_key_visual.jpg 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2400x1260/2400x1260/filters:focal(1200x630:1201x631):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25820645/geforce_rtx_50_series_laptops_key_visual.jpg 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2400x1260/2400x1260/filters:focal(1200x630:1201x631):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25820645/geforce_rtx_50_series_laptops_key_visual.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><div><figcaption><em>RTX 50-series laptops are coming in March.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Nvidia</cite></p></div></div><p>Huang demonstrated Nvidia’s RTX Blackwell GPUs with a real-time rendering demo at the beginning of the company’s CES keynote today.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main"><h2><a href="#main"></a></h2>
<p>Programming has obvious abilities to increase productivity through automated manipulation of data.  Metaprogramming allows code to be treated as data, turning programming’s power back onto itself.  Programming close to the metal has perhaps the most to gain from metaprogramming as high level concepts need to be mapped precisely to low level operations.  Yet outside of functional languages I’ve always found the metaprogramming story to be a disappointment.  So when I saw that Zig lists metaprogramming as a major feature, I took interest.</p><p>Honestly, my first experience writing something using Zig’s comptime were pretty rough.  The concepts seemed foreign, and figuring out how to achieve the outcome I wanted was difficult.  Then with a perspective shift, everything clicked and suddenly I loved it.  To help speed you along that path of discovery, presented below are 6 different “views” of comptime.  Each view focuses on a different way you can translate existing programming knowledge into working with Zig.</p><p>This is also not a full guide on all you need to know to write comptime. It’s more focused on providing a breadth of strategies, stretching your understanding in different ways that together lend a fuller picture of how to think about comptime.</p><p>For clarity, all of the examples are valid Zig code, but the transformations done by the examples are only conceptual in nature.  They are not how Zig is implemented.</p><h2>View 0: You can ignore it.</h2><p>It’s pretty weird to say I love a feature, then immediately declare you can ignore it.  However, I’m starting with what I truly think is Zig comptime’s superpower.  The third item in <code>zig zen</code> is <q>Favor reading code over writing code.</q>  Being able to easily read code is important for all sorts of reasons, as it is how you build a conceptual understanding that is required to debug or make modifications to that codebase.</p><p>Metaprogramming can quickly land itself into the realm of “write only code”.  If you’re trying to work with macro based metaprogramming or code generation, there’s now two versions of the code: the source code and the expanded code.  The extra layer of indirection makes everything from reading to debugging the code more difficult.  If you determine the behavior of the program needs to change, you need to determine what the generated code needs to be, and then have determine how to get the metaprogramming to produce that code.</p><p>In Zig, none of that overhead necessary.  You can simply ignore that portions of the code are run at different times, conceptually mixing runtime and comptime.  To demonstrate this, let’s step through two different pieces of code.  The first is some normal runtime code to set a baseline for stepping through code, and the second utilizes comptime.</p><div><div id="08D759430C_0"><pre><span><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>void</span> <span>{</span></span>

That is the entire point!  An executable of this code is as efficient as if you hand wrote a sum function for the struct’s type in C, yet the code reads like something you might write in a language with runtime reflection.  While this isn’t how Zig actually works, this also isn’t some entirely theoretical exercise either: the Zig core team is working on a debugger that lets you step through code mixing comptime and runtime exactly like this example.</p><p>There’s a lot of Zig which is comptime, much more than some simple type reflection, yet you don’t need to dig into any of the details to simply read code.  Of course, if you want to actually write coding using comptime, you will eventually need to do more than ignore it.</p><h2>View 1: Oh look, generics.</h2><p>Generics are not a specific feature in Zig.  Instead a simple subset of comptime features together handle everything you need for generic programming.  This view doesn’t let you understand all of comptime, but it does provide you an entry point to complete many of the tasks you might use it for.  To make a type generic, simply wrap its definition in a function which takes a type, and returns a type.</p><div><div id="32927D716A_0"><pre><span><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>GenericMyStruct</span><span>(</span><span>comptime</span> <span>T</span><span>:</span> <span>type</span><span>)</span> <span>type</span> <span>{</span></span>

Additionally the block is labeled “init”, so that the whole block can evaluate to a value with the later break.  A writer which counts how many bytes are written (but discards the actual bytes written) is used to determine the total length.  An array is created with that length, written to, and set as full_fizzbuzz.</p><p>Timing just the critical section, the precomputed version runs about 9 times faster.  Of course, this example is so small the total execution time is dominated by other factors, but you get the idea.</p><p>There are a few small differences between comptime and runtime.  Only comptime has access to variables of types <code>comptime_int, comptime_float, or type</code>.  Additionally some functions have only comptime arguments, effectively making them comptime only.  Runtime is the only one to have access to system calls, or anything which would use them.  If your code doesn’t use any of those features, it will work equally well in both comptime and runtime.</p><h2>View 3: Partial Evaluation</h2><p>Now we’re getting to the fun stuff.</p><p>One way to view evaluation of code is to substitute inputs with their runtime value, and then repeatedly substitute the first expression into the evaluated form until only the result remains.  This is common in CS theory contexts, and some functional languages.  As a set up to a later example, we’ll use the array sum to get an idea of this process:</p><div><div id="92FB17A09D_0"><pre><span><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>void</span> <span>{</span></span>

The primary difference is that Zig first parses the syntax of your code, and turns it into bytecode for a virtual machine.  That virtual machine running is how comptime is implemented.  This virtual machine will evaluate whatever it can, and emit new bytecode (which is later translated into machine code) for whatever needs to be handled at runtime.  Conditionals such as if statements with runtime inputs simply emit both paths.</p><p>A natural result of this is that dead code is never semantically analyzed.  This can take some getting used to, as writing an invalid function doesn’t always give you a compile error until you actually try to use it.  However this also makes compilation more efficient, and allows more natural looking conditional compilation, no <code>#ifdef</code>s here!</p><p>It’s worth noting how much comptime permeates Zig’s design.  All Zig code runs through this virtual machine, including functions with no obvious use of comptime.  Even where you see simple type names, such as function arguments, are actually expressions which evaluate in comptime to a variable of type <code>type</code>.  This is how the generics example above works.  It also means you can use a more complicated expressions to calculate a type, where appropriate.</p><p>Another consequence of this is that static analysis of Zig code is much more complicated than most statically typed languages, since significant portions of the compiler need to run to even determine all of the types.  So until Zig tooling is able to catch up, editor tools such as code completion don’t always work well.</p><h2>View 5: Textual Code Generation</h2><p>I lamented the difficulty of writing code that outputs new source code at the beginning of the post.  Yet it remains a powerful tool that, even in Zig, has its place in solving some problems.  If this method of metaprogramming is familiar to you then moving to Zig comptime might feel like a significant downgrade.  There is a familiar structure to writing code that, when run, produces code.</p><p>But wait, the last example did just that, right?  If you look at things in just the right way, there is an underlying equivalence between code that writes code and mixed comptime and runtime code.</p><p>The following example doesn’t step through code, instead it flips between two versions.  The first is an example which outputs the code, and the second is the familiar comptime example.  The two versions of code are aligned with the same logic on the same line.</p><div><div id="17333ED16D_0"><pre><span><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>writeSumFn</span><span>(</span></span>

</pre></div><p>Toggle</p><p>The fields retain the conversion above, but mix the two in a single line.  The field’s type expression is done by the generator/at comptime, while the field itself ends up as a definition used by the runtime code.</p><p>References to the name of the type are more direct with comptime, able to use the function directly instead of having to concat text into a name that has be to consistent across uses.</p><p>There is an exception to this view.  You can create types where the names of the fields are determined at comptime, however doing so involves calling a builtin function with a specification containing a list of field definitions.  As a result you can’t define declarations, such as methods, on these types.  In practice this doesn’t limit the expressiveness of your code, but it does limit what kinds of API you can expose to other code.</p><p>Relevant to this section are textual macros such as those in C.  Most of the sane things you can do can be done in comptime, though they rarely take a form that looks similar.  However, you can’t do everything that text macros allow.  For example, you can’t decide that you dislike a Zig keyword and have a macro substitute your own.  I think this is the right call, even if it’s a rough transition for those used to that ability.  Besides, Zig has half a century of programmers figuring out what is right, so its choices are far more sane.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>When reading Zig code to understand the end behavior, taking comptime into consideration isn’t necessary.  When writing comptime code, I usually think about it in one of the forms of partial evaluation.  However, if you know how you’d solve a problem using a different methodology of metaprogramming, it’s very likely you’ll be able to translate it into comptime.</p><p>Realizing the textual code generation conversion exists is why I’m all in on Zig’s style of comptime metaprogramming.  On one hand, textual code generation is maximally powerful, on the other hand, the ability to ignore comptime while reading and debugging is maximally simple.  This is why, as I titled the post, Zig’s comptime is bonkers good.</p><h2>Further Reading</h2><p>Zig is not a one trick pony built upon comptime.  You can learn more about Zig at the <a href="https://ziglang.org/" target="_blank">official website</a>.</p><p>I used the same example multiple times in this post to simplify showing the different conversions that take place.  The downside of this is despite talking a lot about comptime, I haven’t actually shown much of it.  The <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.13.0/" target="_blank">language reference</a> goes over the specific features of comptime.</p><p>If you want to see more examples, I recommend just reading some of Zig’s standard library.  A few links for the curious:</p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/0.13.0/lib/std/fmt.zig#L80" target="_blank">formatting function used by std.debug.print</a> in the examples is a powerful generic function.  Lots of languages parse their format strings at runtime, and possibly add some special validators to the string format to catch errors early.  In Zig, the format string is parsed at comptime, creating efficient output code while also performing all validation at compile time.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/0.13.0/lib/std/array_list.zig#L25" target="_blank">ArrayList</a> is a fairly simple but fully featured generic container.</p><p>Zig main functions can have one of several different return types.  In typical Zig fashion, this isn’t some magical implementation in the compiler, but just some <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/0.13.0/lib/std/start.zig#L508" target="_blank">typical comptime code</a>.</p>

<p>The version he showed was quite different to what actually ended up shipping, with square boxes around the icons, and an actual “Dock” folder in your user’s home folder that contained aliases to the items stored.</p>



<p>I should know – I had spent the previous 18 months or so as the main engineer working away on it. At that very moment, I was watching from a cubicle in Apple Cork, in Ireland. For the second time in my short Apple career, I said a quiet prayer to the gods of demos, hoping that things didn’t break. For context, I was in my twenties at this point and scared witless.</p>



<p>I didn’t design the dock – that was Bas Ording, a talented young UI designer that Steve had personally recruited. But it was my job to take his prototypes built in Macromind Director and turn them into working code, as part of the Finder team.</p>



<p>I had already written another dock – <a href="https://dragthing.com/">DragThing</a> – before I worked for Apple, and that had helped me get a job there. I moved over from Scotland to Ireland in late 1996 with my future wife, with both of us joining the small software team there. It was primarily a manufacturing plant, but there was a little bit of software and hardware testing and engineering that went on around the edges.</p>



<p>I worked on a number of things in the early days. I was on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copland_(operating_system)">Copland</a> installer for two weeks before the project was cancelled. Then, a couple of <a href="https://www.macintoshrepository.org/26825-apple-magic-collection-3">Disney Print Studio CDs</a> that shipped with the Performas. I loved doing UI stuff, but somehow ended up working on a command line Mac OS X Server authentication component for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_Ease">At Ease</a> that was to be used with a new line of diskless netboot computers that nobody had actually seen. It turned out I’d actually been on the iMac project all this time, and in the end they got hard drives.</p>



<p>In the middle of all that, when I was out in Cupertino, I was asked if I wanted to work on a secret project with the code name “Überbar”. I was shown some prototypes and basically told that six people had seen it, and if it leaked they would know it was me that had talked. I figured if anybody was finally going to kill off DragThing, it might as well be me.</p>



<p>The new Finder (codename “Millennium”) was at this point being written on Mac OS 9, because Mac OS X wasn’t exactly firing on all cylinders quite yet. The filesystem wasn’t working well, which is not super helpful when you are trying to write a user interface on top of it. The Dock was part of the Finder then, and could lean on all the high level C++ interfaces for dealing with disks and files that the rest of the team was working on. So, I started on Mac OS 9, working away in Metrowerks Codewarrior. The Finder was a Carbon app, so we could actually make quite a bit of early progress on 9, before the OS was ready for us. I vividly remember the first time we got the code running on Mac OS X.</p>



<p>Because the Dock was a huge secret, along with the rest of the Aqua user interface, it was only enabled on a handful of machines. I didn’t see the shiny lickable buttons of Aqua itself for quite a while after I’d been working on the Dock . There were rumours that any screenshot of Aqua would have the hardware MAC address of the machine encoded into the image, so leaks could be tracked down.</p>



<p>Before I had ever seen the new UI, there was one moment where I had somehow – I genuinely don’t remember why on earth this happened – had been tasked with designing a placeholder boot screen for the OS itself. I made a blue shiny Apple with pinstripes, in the style of the iMac.</p>

<p>It lasted precisely one build before being yanked out extremely quickly. I assume because <em>somebody</em> was unhappy with the entirely coincidental Aqua-like appearance.</p>



<p>But I trundled away, making the best dock that I could while staying true to the original design, and making <a href="https://512pixels.net/2017/06/a-trip-to-infinite-loop-two-decades-later/">frequent trips to the US</a>, initially living out of the Cupertino Inn across the road from Infinite Loop.</p>



<p>You may have heard me tell this story before, and I apologise if so. But it’s been long enough that people just know me for PCalc, and don’t even remember DragThing, let alone events that happened before some of you were even born.</p>



<p>At one point during a trip over, Steve was talking to Bas and asked how things were coming along with the Dock. He replied something along the lines of “going well, the engineer is over from Ireland right now, etc”. Steve left, and then visited my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Serlet">manager’s manager’s manager</a> and said the fateful words (as reported to me by people who were in the room where it happened).</p>



<p>“It has come to my attention that the engineer working on the Dock is in FUCKING IRELAND”.</p>



<p>I was told that I had to move to Cupertino. Immediately. Or else.</p>



<p>I did not wish to move to the States. I liked being in Europe. Ultimately, after much consideration, many late night conversations with my wife, and even buying a guide to moving, I said no.</p>



<p>They said ok then. We’ll just tell Steve you did move.</p>



<p>And so for the next year, I flew back and forth between Cork to Cupertino, and stayed out there as much as regulations would allow. I had an office on the Finder team corridor. I can only imagine that Steve would walk by looking for me, and they would say he’d just missed me, while I was being bundled onto a plane at the other end. I had to come over whenever there were Dock demos, but I was not allowed to be left in the same room as Steve, lest I reveal the truth. The demo room with the blanked out windows had two doors, and I went out one before he came in the other.</p>



<p>In the end, Macworld 2000 happened, and finally all the secrets were revealed to the world. I hoped that at this point, it didn’t matter where I was, and I could finally relax. Less than a month later, exactly on my birthday I believe, I got another call.</p>



<p>I had to move to Cupertino. Or else. And this time, the “else” was that I would be taken off the Dock and the Finder, and I couldn’t be guaranteed any interesting work ever again.</p>



<p>So I politely declined, and resigned. About three weeks later, the rest of the remaining software group in Cork was fired. Clearly, the plan had been to get rid of everybody, but they couldn’t tell me that at the time. I should have waited and I’d have got a payoff at least…</p>



<p>My version of the Dock shipped once to developers, with the Developer Preview 3 of Mac OS X. John Siracusa <em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2000/02/mac-os-x-dp3/">absolutely hated it</a></em>. We remain friends.</p>



<p>After that, the engineer who took over from me rewrote the Dock entirely, and none of my code actually shipped to the public in the end. Eighteen months of hard work out the window, ah well.</p>



<p>But I learned a great deal, made a lot of friends, and the experience spurred me on to resurrect DragThing for Mac OS X, which proved very popular for quite some time. <a href="https://pcalc.com/">PCalc</a> also came back to life around then, and that’s still going today!</p>



<p>As a final note, when I left Apple for the last time, and emptied out my drawers, at the very bottom of the last drawer I found my <em>distinctly unsigned NDA</em>.</p>

<p dir="auto">We want to make it as easy as possible to self host! In the <code>docker-images</code> folder of the project you will find many variations of the backend you can host, so you can host just what you want, without the bloat of the things you don't want. This is a work in progress, and we're constantly working on adding more. You can read more about self hosting in the <a href="https://docs.formbee.dev/docs/category/self-hosting" rel="nofollow">Official Formbee self-hosting docs</a>. The docs will walk you through pulling the docker images, and running them with the correct environmental variables, then you can host them wherever you like to host your containers!</p>

	<h2>Synthesizing Music from JSON</h2>

	<p>tl;dr: <a href="https://github.com/phoboslab/pl_synth">pl_synth</a> is a tiny music synthesizer for C &amp; JS and an editor (“tracker”) to create instruments and arrangements.</p>
<p>You can try it out at <a href="https://phoboslab.org/synth/#eJytk9mNwCAMRBuaD8xhoBaU/tvYGSCH9pKyWpDBNiaYZzJaboYxRgWbRYNhqt2Q6AhBzohSLMEocFjnkkIdHKAtsR8YnHAKTo3+YanBcsGcS8B72287t7e2Ukvl4an4m5227W/t4xCGhbgLixPwqUcdwyPYYG6FahbT3iJaF+TCoVYhTXCRvujScfWLNGUfHDC/dbUJhrIJreUTD2Xn/XXbt8vSKNpPVIrL+9aaywxTKlkH0r0jPgcmkdBAM0puWoLDDQ91vkgkT8KSCaDQloZY5xNcHbC7LzDPK6wjC/7Xu/JuK1mlOQseTWWLFpjqdHvTT+UBmTUPs/p0IvEu8Pk/ZXj47TILYbjK85N6qH0A4LHEdA==">phoboslab.org/synth/</a></p>

<p><em>The song Microscope by Ferris / Youth Uprising playing in pl_synth</em>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=53615">Sonant</a> is a brilliant piece of software. It gives you 8 tracks, where each track has its own “instrument” (just a bunch of parameters) and a number of patterns. You fill the patterns with notes and lay out the sequence of patterns. Out comes the music. </p>
<p>Sonant was made for the demo scene and is therefore very concerned about size: both the code size of the synthesizer as well as the data size needed to define the music. And even with its tiny size it still offers a lot of flexibility for the artist.</p>
<p>In 2011 Sonant was ported to JavaScript by <a href="https://www.bitsnbites.eu/">Marcus Geelnard</a> as <a href="https://sonantlive.bitsnbites.eu/">Sonant Live</a> and later forked as <a href="https://github.com/nicolas-van/sonant-x-live">Sonant-X Live</a> by <a href="https://x.com/nicolasvanhoren">Nicolas Vanhoren</a> to support the newer WebAudio APIs in Browsers. I have used Sonant-X in <a href="https://phoboslab.org/log/2018/09/underrun-making-of">Underrun</a>, <a href="https://phoboslab.org/log/2019/09/voidcall-making-of">Voidcall</a> and <a href="https://phoboslab.org/log/2021/09/q1k3-making-of">Q1k3</a> – each time condensing and refining it a bit more.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I thought it would be nice to use it in C with <a href="https://phoboslab.org/log/2024/08/high_impact">high_impact</a> too. Massaging the original C++ synthesizer was straight forward. The original tracker however only works on Windows and doesn't come with the source code; likewise the newer JS Sonant-X Live has aged quite a bit and isn't as good as it could be for modern Browsers. So I set out to write a new tracker from scratch.</p>
<h2>Arranging Instruments</h2>
<p>There are many different ways to lay out instruments and notes to define a <em>song</em>. In the simplest case you'd have a single list where each element defines an instrument, a note and the exact time that it's being played at. E.g.:</p>
<pre><code><span>[</span>
    <span>{</span><span>"instrument"</span><span>:</span> <span>"piano"</span><span>,</span> <span>"note"</span><span>:</span> <span>"c-4"</span><span>,</span> <span>"time"</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>.</span><span>123</span><span>},</span>
    <span>{</span><span>"instrument"</span><span>:</span> <span>"piano"</span><span>,</span> <span>"note"</span><span>:</span> <span>"d-4"</span><span>,</span> <span>"time"</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>.</span><span>456</span><span>},</span>
    <span>{</span><span>"instrument"</span><span>:</span> <span>"piano"</span><span>,</span> <span>"note"</span><span>:</span> <span>"e-4"</span><span>,</span> <span>"time"</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>.</span><span>789</span><span>},</span>
    <span>// …
</span><span>]</span></code></pre>
<p>This format would be quite tedious to edit and is not very space efficient. Typically, music has a lot of repeating patterns. So a layer of <em>abstraction</em> would be helpful to lay out patterns of notes, instead of notes directly.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://keithclark.github.io/ZzFXM/">ZzFXM</a> for example, each <em>pattern</em> has a number of <em>tracks</em>, where each track has a number of <em>notes</em>. A single overall list of patterns defines a song. This, in my opinion, is the wrong way around.</p>
<p>Instead, in Sonant (and thus pl_synth) a <em>song</em> consists of one or more <em>tracks</em>. Each track has a specific <em>instrument</em> and one or more <em>patterns</em>. Each pattern has exactly 32 rows, where each row may contain one <em>note</em>. A list of pattern indices for each track defines the overall sequence.</p>
<p>This, in general, matches the layout of a lot of music better. E.g. it allows you to have repeating drum beat track that is independent of the melody. It's also very compact as a file format and works nicely as a C struct.</p>

<h2>Creating Sounds from Thin Air</h2>
<p>The heart of pl_synth is a loop that creates the raw PCM samples for a single <em>note</em> of an <em>instrument</em>. The instrument is defined by a bunch of parameters, most importantly the waveform (Sine, Square, Sawtooth or Triangle) and the frequency of two independent oscillators. The volume of those are defined by the <em>envelope</em> as three values: <em>attack</em>, <em>sustain</em> and <em>release</em> (how quickly that tone gets from 0% to 100% volume, how long it stays at 100% and how quickly it goes back to 0%). This all is directly adopted from the original Sonant C++ version.</p>
<p><img src="https://phoboslab.org/content/assets/pl_synth_sawtooth.png" alt="A Sawtooth Wave">
<em>A short sawtooth wave; the envelope is visualized by the grey area around it.</em></p>
<p>On its own, this is not terribly exciting. Pure sine waves sound like telephone dial tones; a square wave sounds just like what a Gameboy might produce (which of course is <a href="https://youtu.be/BKm45Az02YE?t=736">no coincidence</a>). But if you put a delay effect on it, modulate the oscillator frequency with a LFO (low frequency oscillator) and apply a band pass filter you can produce a surprising range of different sounds.</p>
<p><img src="https://phoboslab.org/content/assets/pl_synth_instrument.png" alt="Synthesizer instrument definition"></p>
<p>The whole loop that does all this is so short that I can reproduce it here in full (modified a bit for clarity). <code>PL_SYNTH_TAB(waveform, pos)</code> returns the value for a particular waveform at a particular position. E.g. for a sine wave it's just <code>sin(pos)</code>. Each iteration of this loop produces one sample.</p>

<h2>JS Performance</h2>
<p>Of course producing each sample for each track, some with overlapping instruments, means a whole lot of iterations of this loop. Each operation in this loop has an impact on performance.</p>
<h3>5000ms</h3>
<p>Sonant-X Live, the JS port I first used in my game Underrun, was painfully slow. Generating all samples for a song typically took 5 seconds or more. Most of the time was spent in the oscillator functions. Turns out, calling <code>Math.sin()</code> ten million times for 60 seconds of music is not the best idea.</p>
<h3>1000ms</h3>
<p>For my next game, Voidcall, I got the time to generate music down to 1 second. How did I make <code>Math.sin()</code> so much faster? By not calling it at all, of course. Instead, I pre-generated a lookup table for each oscillator.</p>
<pre><code><span>// Generate the lookup tab with 4 oscilators: sin, square, saw, tri
</span><span>let</span> len <span>=</span> <span>4096</span><span>;</span>

</span><span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>All 4 oscillators are stored in one table. The lookup is then computed with an offset for the specific oscilator, e.g. offset <code>8192</code> for the sawtooth oscillator.</p>
<pre><code>sample <span>=</span> tab<span>[</span>offset <span>+</span> <span>((</span>pos <span>*</span> len<span>)</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>4095</span><span>)];</span></code></pre>
<p>The bit and <code>&amp; 4095</code> is equivalent to modulo <code>% 4096</code> but much faster. Hence the power of two table length.</p>
<p>4096 elements provide enough resolution even for very low frequency oscillators. E.g. a barely audible 20hz sound at 44100hz playback rate is just 2205 samples long.</p>
<h3>500ms</h3>
<p>I squeezed out quite a bit more performance by restructuring some of the if statements, merging multiplications and just making sure that there's no division or function calls in the inner loop. E.g.:</p>
<pre><code><span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>let</span> j <span>=</span> num_samples<span>;</span> j <span>&gt;=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> j<span>--) {

    sample <span>*=</span> envelope <span>/</span> <span>255</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>;</span>

<p>The way to speed up the JS version even more is not using JS. I wrote a C version specially tailored to be compiled as a WASM module. Most of the song generation, JSON reading etc. is still handled by JS, but the performance critical part – the sound generation – is done in C.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/phoboslab/pl_synth/blob/master/wasm/pl_synth_wasm_module.c">C source for the WASM module</a> is just 200 lines of code and compiles to 2kb of WASM. The resulting <code>synth.wasm</code> is embedded into the JS source as a base64 string. This of course inflates the size again, but when delivered via gzip it doesn't matter.</p>
<p>The WASM version is about twice the size of vanilla JS version, but also twice as fast.</p>
<p>Fun fact: this WASM module also contains a function to clear a Float32Array.</p>
<pre><code><span>void</span> clear<span>(</span><span>float</span> <span>*</span>samples<span>,</span> <span>int</span> len<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span> i <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> i <span>&lt;</span> len<span>;</span> i<span>++)</span> <span>{</span>
        samples<span>[</span>i<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>In Firefox (as of v133) this is 10x faster than <code>Float32Array.fill(0)</code> in JS.</p>
<p>The WASM version compiles down to <code>memory.fill</code> – basically a <code>memset</code>. In contrast, Firefox/Spidermonkey implements <code>TypedArray.fill()</code> as a “self-hosted builtin” – that is: a JavaScript function, not native code. This is somewhat surprising to see, considering that TypeArrays were introduced <em>specifically</em>  for performance reasons.</p>
<p>For what it's worth, there's no performance difference between <code>TypedArray.fill()</code> and the WASM version in Chrome.</p>
<h3><del>25ms</del></h3>
<p>I experimented with a version that would do everything through WebAudio nodes instead of generating raw samples. This turned out to be massive pain in the ass. Working with WebAudio is cumbersome and the code size exploded tenfold. This <em>design by consortium node graph</em> is just not my idea of fun.</p>
<p>Another approach would be generating samples <em>on the fly</em> using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioWorkletProcessor">AudioWorklets</a>. This is probably worth exploring in the future.</p>
<h2>Native C Version</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/phoboslab/pl_synth/blob/master/c/pl_synth.h">The native C version of pl_synth</a> comes as a single header library. I took some care to make it allocator agnostic (i.e. all memory has to be provided by the caller), but other than that, there's not much to report. </p>
<p>Here's a short <a href="https://github.com/phoboslab/pl_synth/blob/master/c/example.c">example</a> of the C version that generates a song and stores it as .wav file.</p>
<h2>The Tracker</h2>
<p>The Tracker, the editor where you compose your songs, is where I spent most of my time with this project. It's written in plain old JS and comes as a single HTML file. There's no build step, no bundler, no <code>npm install</code> and no server needed. You just launch it with a doubleclick from your local file system (or course online at <a href="https://phoboslab.org/synth/">/synth</a>).</p>
<p>All HTML is generated in JS through a simple <code>h(type, props, ...children)</code> function that returns a DOM element. <code>children</code> can either be undefined, a DOM element, an instance of a special <code>HTMLComponent</code> class or an array of those. <code>HTMLComponent</code> is simply a class that has a <code>.element</code> property for a DOM element. The whole UI is built with this simple setup.</p>
<p>E.g. the <code>Track</code> class – the UI element that holds all patterns and the instrument for a single track – looks like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>class</span> Track <span>extends</span> HTMLComponent <span>{</span>
    app <span>=</span> <span>null</span><span>;</span>

<p>Now, you're probably wondering how I re-render elements when something changes. The answer is of course using the DOM directly. Setting <code>.textContent = 'foo'</code> or calling <code>.classList.add('zomg')</code> is really no big deal. In fact, being so selective about these updates makes the whole thing feel quite snappy.</p>
<h2>Undo / Redo</h2>
<p>I spent a lot of time to make the tracker <em>feel</em> right. Adding a lot of keyboard shortcuts for playback, selections, copy, paste and of course undo &amp; redo.</p>
<p>Implementing undo can be quite challenging, especially for more complex apps. But here, it simply stores the <strong>whole song</strong> for each step in the history. Each time a new entry in the history is created, the app is queried for the JSON string of the current song. On restore, the app simply loads the JSON string from history again.</p>
<p>Similar actions that occur within a short time span are grouped together as one entry in the history. This is done by: </p>
<ol>
<li>giving each action a description</li>
<li>setting a timeout (500ms) before committing the action </li>
<li>reset the timeout if another action with the same description is added</li>
</ol>
<p>This all is managed in the History class, instantiated with a <code>stateCallback</code> that returns the current song JSON and <code>restoreCallback</code> that loads JSON data. The class looks like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>class</span> History <span>{</span>

<p>The app then calls <code>history.add()</code> each time something is changed. For instance if you set a note in a pattern: <code>history.add('set note')</code>. If you don't change another pattern within 500ms, the action is committed to the history stack.</p>
<p>An important detail here is that you don't call <code>history.add()</code> with the state of the app. Instead, the History class specifically asks for the state (through the <code>stateCallback()</code>) only when it is truly needed. This ensures that we don't query the state of the app (potentially an expensive operation) more than necessary.</p>
<p>As an example, when you click and drag the volume slider for an instrument, each time you move the slider even just 1px the app calls <code>history.add()</code>. But this is not a problem: as long as you keep moving within 500ms nothing is committed yet; no state is queried.</p>

<p>as well as in a new compact array representation or from a native C-struct source. The new array format is mostly equivalent to the legacy JSON format – just without property names and optionally with implicit <code>0</code> values. The latter makes this invalid as JSON, but still valid JS:</p>

<p>Compressing the JS array format with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CompressionStream">CompressionStream</a> and base64 encoding the result typically yields a string that is 300-1200 characters long (depending on the length and complexity of the song itself) –  short enough to fit into a URL</p>
<p>So here's the soundtrack for <a href="https://phoboslab.org/log/2021/09/q1k3-making-of">Q1k3</a>, all stored in the URL alone:</p>
<p><a href="https://phoboslab.org/synth/#eJxtkVuWxCAIRDdUHzwEdS2e7H8bA5g40+nBIwI+uKksJ25Ya3UADDED/oRgIkBdPfIGAfOcFTZ0vrAY3wN1/4w4tVgcOXH7Yx8b15Vnaz+7CyLk8STJEgYLGn2SwoFElFAD0uIJZAmKdq/2zrNNwquUV7yMZeSGWHnaXCkLRo8XRp3xeCnh4k2eWpCBxS6w+OpAG9mNJ5UahOmF9lLnKNQmcmL74z5rm6T6+y1QEDSNziVCN7IMUg/Kn+Q8CIMj4lnX4gorH5KHJmW516JRObtbHta+Ffuq0/91sV817Ur7AYzBfQA=">/synth/#eJxtkVuWxCAIRDdUHzwEdS2e7H8bA5g40+nBIwI+uKksJ25Ya3UADDED/oRgIkBdPfIGAfOcFTZ0vrAY3wN1/4w4tVgcOXH7Yx8b15Vnaz+7CyLk8STJEgYLGn2SwoFElFAD0uIJZAmKdq/2zrNNwquUV7yMZeSGWHnaXCkLRo8XRp3xeCnh4k2eWpCBxS6w+OpAG9mNJ5UahOmF9lLnKNQmcmL74z5rm6T6+y1QEDSNziVCN7IMUg/Kn+Q8CIMj4lnX4gorH5KHJmW516JRObtbHta+Ffuq0/91sV817Ur7AYzBfQA=</a></p>
<p>I have no doubt that this could be compressed further by using a binary format instead of JSON. Of course this would come at the expense of more code needed for the compression/decompression. For a <a href="https://js13kgames.com/">JS13k</a> entry your best option is probably the JS Array format, as your whole submission will be zipped up anyway.</p>
<h2>pl_synth in high_impact</h2>
<p>As stated in the beginning of this post, the initial reason for all of this was to provide an alternative for sound and music in <a href="https://phoboslab.org/log/2024/08/high_impact">high_impact</a>. pl_synth is now bundled with high_impact and one of the demo games (<a href="https://github.com/phoboslab/high_drop">Drop</a>) uses it exclusively for sound and music.</p>

<p>it now generates a sound effect on startup:</p>

    <address>Carson Gross, Alex Petros</address>
    <p><time>January 01, 2025</time></p><h2 id="in-the-beginning"><a href="#in-the-beginning" aria-label="Anchor link for: in-the-beginning">In The Beginning…</a></h2>
<p>htmx began life as <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://intercoolerjs.org/">intercooler.js</a>, a library built around jQuery that added behavior based
on HTML attributes.</p>
<p>For developers who are not familiar with it, <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> is a venerable JavaScript
library that made writing cross-platform JavaScript a lot easier during a time when browser implementations were very
inconsistent, and JavaScript didn’t have many of the convenient APIs and features that it does now.</p>
<p>Today many web developers consider jQuery to be “legacy software.” With all due respect to this perspective, jQuery is
currently used on <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/javascript_library">75% of all public websites</a>, a number that dwarfs all other JavaScript tools.</p>
<p>Why has jQuery remained so ubiquitous?</p>
<p>Here are three technical reasons we believe contribute to its ongoing success:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is very easy to add to a project (just a single, dependency-free link)</li>
<li>It has maintained a very consistent API, remaining largely backwards compatible over its life (intercooler.js works
with jQuery v1, v2 and v3)</li>
<li>As a library, you can use as much or as little of it as you like: it stays out of the way otherwise and doesn’t
dictate the structure of your application</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="htmx-is-the-new-jquery"><a href="#htmx-is-the-new-jquery" aria-label="Anchor link for: htmx-is-the-new-jquery">htmx is the New jQuery</a></h2>
<p>Now, that’s a ridiculous (and arrogant) statement to make, of course, but it is an <em>ideal</em> that we on the htmx team are
striving for.</p>
<p>In particular, we want to emulate these technical characteristics of jQuery that make it such a low-cost, high-value
addition to the toolkits of web developers. Alex has
discussed <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lASLZ9TgXyc">“Building The 100 Year Web Service”</a> and we want htmx to be a
useful tool for exactly that use case.</p>
<p>Websites that are built with jQuery stay online for a very long time, and websites built with htmx should be capable of
the same (or better).</p>
<p>Going forward, htmx will be developed with its <em>existing</em> users in mind.</p>
<p>If you are an existing user of htmx—or are thinking about becoming one—here’s what that means.</p>
<h3 id="stability-as-a-feature"><a href="#stability-as-a-feature" aria-label="Anchor link for: stability-as-a-feature">Stability as a Feature</a></h3>
<p>We are going to work to ensure that htmx is extremely stable in both API &amp; implementation. This means accepting and
documenting the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://htmx.org/quirks/">quirks</a> of the current implementation.</p>
<p>Someone upgrading htmx (even from 1.x to 2.x) should expect things to continue working as before.</p>
<p>Where appropriate, we may add better configuration options, but we won’t change defaults.</p>
<h3 id="no-new-features-as-a-feature"><a href="#no-new-features-as-a-feature" aria-label="Anchor link for: no-new-features-as-a-feature">No New Features as a Feature</a></h3>
<p>We are going to be increasingly inclined to not accept new proposed features in the library core.</p>
<p>People shouldn’t feel pressure to upgrade htmx over time unless there are specific bugs that they want fixed, and they
should feel comfortable that the htmx that they write in 2025 will look very similar to htmx they write in 2035 and
beyond.</p>
<p>We will consider new core features when new browser features become available, for example we
are <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://htmx.org/examples/move-before/">already using</a> the experimental <code>moveBefore()</code> API on supported browsers.</p>
<p>However, we expect most new functionality to be explored and delivered via the
htmx <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://htmx.org/extensions/">extensions API</a>, and will work to make the extensions API more capable where
appropriate.</p>
<h3 id="quarterly-releases"><a href="#quarterly-releases" aria-label="Anchor link for: quarterly-releases">Quarterly Releases</a></h3>
<p>Our release schedule is going to be roughly quarterly going forward.</p>
<p>There will be no death march upgrades associated with htmx, and there is no reason to monitor htmx releases for major
functionality changes, just like with jQuery. If htmx 1.x is working fine for you, there is no reason to feel like you
need to move to 2.x.</p>

<p>htmx does not aim to be a total solution for building web applications and services:
it <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3648188.3675127">generalizes hypermedia controls</a>, and that’s roughly about it.</p>
<p>This means that a very important way to improve htmx — and one with lots of work remaining — is by helping improve the tools
and techniques that people use <em>in conjunction</em> with htmx.</p>
<p>Doing so makes htmx dramatically more useful <em>without</em> any changes to htmx itself.</p>

<p>While htmx gives you a few new tools in your HTML, it has no opinions about other important aspects of building your
websites. A flagship feature of htmx is that it does not dictate what backend or database you use.</p>
<p>htmx is <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://htmx.org/essays/hypermedia-on-whatever-youd-like/">compatible with lots of backends</a>, and we want to
help make hypermedia-driven development work better for all of them.</p>
<p>One part of the hypermedia ecosystem that htmx has already helped improve is template engines. When
we <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://htmx.org/essays/template-fragments/">first wrote</a> about how “template fragments” make defining partial page
replacements much simpler, they were a relatively rare feature in template engines.</p>
<p>Not only are fragments much more common now, that essay
is <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mitsuhiko/minijinja/issues/260">frequently</a> <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sponsfreixes/jinja2-fragments">cited</a>
as an inspiration for building the feature.</p>
<p>There are many other ways that the experience of writing hypermedia-based applications can be improved, and we will
remain dedicated to identifying and promoting those efforts.</p>

<p>Although htmx will not be changing dramatically going forward, we will continue energetically evangelizing the ideas of
hypermedia.</p>
<p>In particular, we are trying to push <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3648188.3675127">the ideas</a> of htmx into the
HTML standard itself, via the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://alexanderpetros.com/triptych/">Triptych project</a>. In an ideal world, htmx
functionality disappears into the web platform itself.</p>
<p>htmx code written <em>today</em> will continue working forever, of course, but in the very long run perhaps there will be no
need to include the library to achieve <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://htmx.org/examples">similar UI patterns</a> via hypermedia.</p>
<h2 id="intercooler-was-right"><a href="#intercooler-was-right" aria-label="Anchor link for: intercooler-was-right">Intercooler Was Right</a></h2>
<p>At the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://intercoolerjs.org/docs#philosophy">end of the intercooler docs</a>, we said this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many javascript projects are updated at a dizzying pace. Intercooler is not.</p>
<p>This is not because it is dead, but rather because it is (mostly) right: the basic idea is right, and the implementation
at least right enough.</p>
<p>This means there will not be constant activity and churn on the project, but rather
a <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewardship_(theology)">stewardship</a> relationship: the main goal now is to not screw
it up. The documentation will be improved, tests will be added, small new declarative features will be added around the
edges, but there will be no massive rewrite or constant updating. This is in contrast with the software industry in
general and the front end world in particular, which has comical levels of churn.</p>
<p>Intercooler is a sturdy, reliable tool for web development.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Leaving aside <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGyAWH5btwY">the snark at the end of the third paragraph</a>, this thinking
is very much applicable to htmx. In fact, perhaps even more so since htmx is a standalone piece of software, benefiting
from the experiences (and mistakes) of intercooler.js.</p>
<p>We hope to see htmx, in its own small way, join the likes of giants like jQuery as a sturdy and reliable tool for
building your 100 year web services.</p>

    <p>OK, this is going to sound crazy: I believe all clocks are 30 seconds late.</p>
<p>Let's get a few things out of the way: this is neither about time zones, nor leap seconds.
It's not about synchronization of clocks, and it's not about relativity or any obscure corner of physics.
I'm talking about everyday clocks. The ones that you might have around in your house, like this one that sits on my desk:</p>
<p><img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/victorpoughon/post2image1-2.webp" alt="post2image1"></p>
<p>Or this one that stands in London:</p>
<p><img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/victorpoughon/572px-big_ben_elizabeth_tower_london_2023_01_detail.webp" alt="572px-Big_Ben_Elizabeth_Tower_London_2023_01_Detail"></p>
<p><em>(Photo from Wikipedia)</em></p>
<p>Or even the clock on your phone! Maybe they're all correctly set very precisely to a very accurate reference clock, but here I will argue that they are still exactly 30 seconds late. In other words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It would be more accurate if they were thirty seconds ahead.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="what-are-you-on-about">What are you on about?</h2><p>All the above clocks have one thing in common: they don't show seconds. They truncate down to the nearest lower whole minute, right? So when it's actually <code>14:15:45</code>, they'll show <code>14:15</code>.
And when the actual time goes from <code>14:15:59</code> to <code>14:16:00</code>, then that's when your clock changes from <code>14:15</code> to <code>14:16</code>.</p>
<p>They apply the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_and_ceiling_functions">floor function</a>!</p>
<p>Ok great. Now hear me out! Let's compute the average error between a usual (truncating) clock, and the precise current time.</p>

<ul>
<li>Sometimes the error is 1 or 2 seconds, like when the clock shows <code>14:02</code> and it's actually <code>14:02:01</code></li>
<li>Sometimes the error is almost 60 seconds, like when the clock shows <code>14:02</code> and it's actually <code>14:02:57</code></li>
</ul>
<p>So, the average error of a truncating clock is 30 seconds. Let that sink in for a moment: <strong>the average error of a clock is 30 seconds</strong>. If clocks
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding">rounded</a>
to the nearest minute instead of truncating, the average error would be 0. Therefore all clocks are 30 seconds late!</p>
<p>Similarly of course, all clocks that show seconds but not milliseconds are half a second late.</p>

<h2 id="this-is-just-a-convention">This is just a convention</h2><blockquote>
<p>But this is just a convention! Truncating, rounding or even ceiling are all valid, as long as we pick one and stick to it. By your logic we should say that it's Tuesday as soon as it's one second past noon on Monday.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well... kind of.</p>
<p>It would be weird if we rounded for years, months and days, that's for sure. I think most people think of those scales as intervals. In other words, July is a period of time, with a start and an end. So are years, centuries, seasons. We are inside of it or outside.</p>
<p>Is it the same for the current minute of the current hour ? I'm not so sure.</p>
<p>Basically I'm arguing that rounding for clocks would be more useful than flooring.
This is especially apparent when you're trying to calculate "how much time until my next meeting?", and your next meeting is at noon. If it's 11:55, you would usually mentally subtract and conclude: the meeting is in 5 minutes. That's how I always do it myself anyway! But the most probable estimate given the available information is actually 4'30"!</p>
<p>If you had a rounding clock instead, 5 minutes would be the correct estimation.</p>
<p>In fact, as we go down the various scales of time all the way from years, months, days and we reach hours, that's when we start truncating! At hours! For example: if it's <code>10:43</code> and you are asked the time and (for some context appropriate reason) you reply with just hours, you would say it's 11! Personally, I would never say that it's 10 if the clock shows anything past <code>10:30</code>. I realize that's probably very different in other cultures, though! And I'd be interested to learn about how different cultures approximate time in language.</p>
<p>So, looking at the various scales of time and how I mentally view them:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Years</strong>: truncate. If the full date has <code>2019</code> in it, I'll say "the year is 2019" - all the way to the end. Saying "it's 2020" in September 2019 is super weird.</li>
<li><strong>Months</strong>: truncate. It's January all the way until it's February.</li>
<li><strong>Days</strong>: truncate. It gets a little weird if it's past midnight and I haven't slept yet. Is tomorrow today? Or is it the day after that? I think collectively we still haven't quite figured that one out yet. And that's ok. Kind of like how "next Friday" becomes ambiguous on Thursdays. Some cultures use times beyond 24:00, like 25:30 to indicate one hour and a half past midnight, and I think that's lovely!</li>
<li><strong>Hours</strong>: That's when mentally, I switch to rounding! At <code>15:48</code> I definitely feel like it's pretty much <code>16:00</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Minutes</strong>: At <code>15:48:57</code>, I definitely feel like it's <code>15:49</code>! But clocks switch back to flooring for for some reason! But mentally we round! This is why I feel like all clocks are 30 seconds late: because the truncating convention doesn't match my intuition at the minute scale.</li>
<li><strong>Seconds and below</strong>: definitely rounding.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please someone tell me I'm not crazy 🙃</p>
