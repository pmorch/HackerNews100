<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>By <!-- -->Benjamin Dicken<!-- --> | <time datetime="2025-03-13">March 13, 2025</time></p><p>Non-volatile storage is a cornerstone of modern computer systems.<!-- --> <!-- -->Every modern photo, email, bank balance, medical record, and other critical pieces of data are kept on digital storage devices, often replicated many times over for added durability.</p><p><strong>Non-volatile</strong> storage, or colloquially just "<strong>disk</strong>", can store binary data even when the computer it is attached to is powered off.<!-- --> <!-- -->Computers have other forms of <strong>volatile</strong> storage such as CPU registers, CPU cache, and random-access memory, all of which are faster but require continuous power to function.</p><p>Here, we're going to cover the history, functionality, and performance of non-volatile storage devices over the history of computing, all using fun and interactive visual elements.<!-- --> <!-- -->This blog is written in celebration of our latest product release: <a href="https://planetscale.com/blog/announcing-metal">PlanetScale Metal</a>.<!-- --> <!-- -->Metal uses locally attached NVMe drives to run your cloud database, as opposed to the slower and less consistent network-attached storage used by most cloud database providers.<!-- --> <!-- -->This results in a blazing fast queries, low latency, and unlimited IOPS.<!-- --> <!-- -->Check out <a href="https://planetscale.com/docs/metal">the docs</a> to learn more.</p><h2 id="tape-storage"><a href="#tape-storage">Tape Storage</a></h2><p>As early as the 1950s, computers were using <strong>tape drives</strong> for non-volatile digital storage.<!-- --> <!-- -->Tape storage systems have been produced in many form factors over the years, ranging from ones that take up an entire room to small drives that can fit in your pocket, such as the iconic Sony Walkman.<!-- --> <!-- -->A tape <strong>Reader</strong> is a box containing hardware specifically designed for reading <strong>tape cartridges</strong>.<!-- --> <!-- -->Tape cartridges are inserted and then unwound which causes the tape to move over the <strong>IO Head</strong>, which can <span>read</span> and <span>write</span> data.</p><p>Though tape started being used to store digital information over 70 years ago, it is still in use today for certain applications.<!-- --> <!-- -->A standard LTO tape cartridge has several-hundred meters of 0.5 inch wide tape.<!-- --> <!-- -->The tape has several tracks running along its length, each track being further divided up into many small cells.<!-- --> <!-- -->A single tape cartridge contains many trillions of cells.</p><p>Each cell can have its magnetic polarization set to up or down, corresponding to a binary 0 or 1.<!-- --> <!-- -->Technically, the magnetic field created by the <em>transition</em> between two cells is what makes the 1 or zero.<!-- --> <!-- -->A long sequence of bits on a tape forms a page of data.<!-- --> <!-- -->In the visualization of the tape reader, we simplify this by showing the tape as a simple sequence of data pages, rather than showing individual bits.</p><p>When a tape needs to be read, it is loaded into a reader, sometimes by hand and sometimes by robot.<!-- --> <!-- -->The reader then spins the cartridge with its motor and uses the <strong>reader head</strong> to read off the binary values as the tape passes underneath.</p><p>Give this a try with the (greatly slowed down) interactive visualization below.<!-- --> <!-- -->You can control the <span>speed of the tape</span> if you'd like it faster or slower.<!-- --> <!-- -->You can also <span>issue read requests</span> and <span>write requests</span> and then monitor how long these take.<!-- --> <!-- -->You'll also be able to see the queue of pending IO operations pop up in the top-left corner.<!-- --> <!-- -->Try issuing a few requests to get a feel for how tape storage works:</p><p>If you spend enough time with this, you will notice that:</p><ol><li>If you read/write to a cell "near" the read head, it's fast.</li><li>If you read/write to a cell "far" from the read head, it's slow.</li></ol><p>Even with modern tape systems, reading data that is far away on a tape can take 10s of seconds, because it may need to spin the tape by hundreds of meters to reach the desired data.<!-- --> <!-- -->Let's compare two more specific, interactive examples to illustrate this further.</p><p>Say we need to <span>read</span> a total of 4 pages and <span>write</span> an additional 4 pages worth of data.<!-- --> <!-- -->In the first scenario, all 4 pages we need to read are in a neat sequence, and the 4 to write to are immediately after the reads.<!-- --> <!-- -->You can see the IO operations queued up in the white container on the top-left.<!-- --> <!-- -->Go ahead and click the <span>Time IO button</span> to see this in action, and observe the time it takes to complete.</p><p>As you can see, it takes somewhere around 3-4 seconds.<!-- --> <!-- -->On a real system, with an IO head that can operate much faster and motors that can drive the spools more quickly, it would be much faster.</p><p>Now consider another scenario where we need to read and write the same number of pages.<!-- --> <!-- -->However, these reads and writes are spread out throughout the tape.<!-- --> <!-- -->Go ahead and click the <span>Time IO button</span> again.</p><p>That took ~7x longer for the same total number of reads and writes!<!-- --> <!-- -->Imagine if this system was being used to load your social media feed or your email inbox.<!-- --> <!-- -->It might take 10s of seconds or even a full minute to display.<!-- --> <!-- -->This would be totally unacceptable.</p><p>Though the latency for random reads and writes is poor, tape systems operate quite well when reading or writing data in long sequences.<!-- --> <!-- -->In fact, tape storage still has many such use cases today in the modern tech world.<!-- --> <!-- -->Tape is particularly well-suited for situations where there is a need for <em>massive</em> amounts of storage that does not need to be read frequently, but needs to be safely stored.<!-- --> <!-- -->This is because tape is both cheaper per-gigabyte and has a longer shelf-life than its competition: solid state drives and hard disk drives.<!-- --> <!-- -->For example, CERN has a tape storage data warehouse with <a href="https://home.cern/science/computing/data-preservation">over 400 petabytes of data</a> under management.<!-- --> <!-- -->AWS also offers <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/vtl/">tape archiving</a> as a service.</p><p>What tape is not well suited for is high-traffic transactional databases.<!-- --> <!-- -->For these and many other high-performance tasks, other storage mediums are needed.</p><h2 id="hard-disk-drives"><a href="#hard-disk-drives">Hard Disk Drives</a></h2><p>The next major breakthrough in storage technology was the <strong>hard disk drive</strong>.</p><p>Instead of storing binary data on a tape, we store them on a small circular metal disk known as the <strong>Platter</strong>.<!-- --> <!-- -->This disk is placed inside of an <strong>enclosure</strong> with a special <strong>read/write head</strong>, and spins very fast (7200 RPM is common, for example).<!-- --> <!-- -->Like the tape, this disk is also divided into tracks.<!-- --> <!-- -->However, the tracks are <em>circular</em>, and a single disk will often have well over 100,000 tracks.<!-- --> <!-- -->Each track contains hundreds of thousands of pages, and each page containing 4k (or so) of data.</p><p>An HDD requires a mechanical spinning motion of both the reader and the platter to bring the data to the correct location for reading.<!-- --> <!-- -->One advantage of HDD over tape is that the entire surface area of the bits is available 100% of the time.<!-- --> <!-- -->It still takes time to move the needle + spin the disk to the correct location for a read or write, but it does not need to be "uncovered" like it needs to be for a tape.<!-- --> <!-- -->This combined with the fact that there are two different things that can spin, means data can be read and written with much lower latency.<!-- --> <!-- -->A typical random read can be performed in 1-3 milliseconds.</p><p>Below is an interactive hard drive.<!-- --> <!-- -->You can control the <span>speed of the platter</span> if you'd like it faster or slower.<!-- --> <!-- -->You can request that the hard drive <span>read a page</span> and <span>write to a nearby available page</span>.<!-- --> <!-- -->If you request a read or write before the previous one is complete, a queue will be built up, and the disk will process the requests in the order it receives them.<!-- --> <!-- -->As before, you'll also be able to see the queue of pending IO operations in the white IO queue box.</p><p>As with the tape, the speed of the platter spin has been slowed down by orders of magnitude to make it easier to see what's going on.<!-- --> <!-- -->In real disks, there would also be many more tracks and sectors, enough to store multiple terabytes of data in some cases.</p><p>Let's again consider a few specific scenarios to see how the order of reads and writes affects latency.</p><p>Say we need to write a total of three pages of data and then read 3 pages afterward.<!-- --> <!-- -->The three writes will happen on nearby available pages, and the reads will be from tracks 1, 4, and 3.<!-- --> <!-- -->Go ahead and click the <span>Time IO button</span>.<!-- --> <!-- -->You'll see the requests hit the queue, the reads and writes get fulfilled, and then the total time at the end.</p><p>Due to the sequential nature of most of these operations, all the tasks were able to complete quickly.</p><p>Now consider the same set of 6 reads and writes, but with them being interleaved in a different order.<!-- --> <!-- -->Go ahead and click the <span>Time IO button</span> again.</p><p>If you had the patience to wait until the end, you should notice how the same total number of reads and writes took much longer.<!-- --> <!-- -->A lot of time was spent waiting for the platter to spin into the correct place under the read head.</p><p>Magnetic disks have supported command queueing directly on the disks for a long time (80s with SCSI, 2000s with SATA).<!-- --> <!-- -->Because of this, the OS can issue multiple commands that run in parallel and potentially out-of-order, similar to SSDs.<!-- --> <!-- -->Magnetic disks also improve their performance if they can build up a queue of operations that the disk controller can then schedule reads and writes to optimize for the geometry of the disk.</p><p>Here's a visualization to help us see the difference between the latency of a <span>random tape read</span> compared to a <span>random disk read</span>.<!-- --> <!-- -->A random tape read will often take multiple seconds (I put 1 second here to be generous) and a disk head seek takes closer to 2 milliseconds (one thousandth of a second)</p><p>Even though HDDs are an improvement over tape, they are still "slow" in some scenarios, especially random reads and writes.<!-- --> <!-- -->The next big breakthrough, and currently the most common storage format for transactional databases, are SSDs.</p><h2 id="solid-state-drives"><a href="#solid-state-drives">Solid State Drives</a></h2><p>Solid State Storage, or "flash" storage, was invented in the 1980s.<!-- --> <!-- -->It was around even while tape and hard disk drives dominated the commercial and consumer storage spaces.<!-- --> <!-- -->It didn't become mainstream for consumer storage until the 2000s due to technological limitations and cost.</p><p>The advantage of SSDs over both tape and disk is that they do not rely on any <em>mechanical</em> components to read data.<!-- --> <!-- -->All data is read, written, and erased electronically using a special type of non-volatile <em>transistor</em> known as NAND flash.<!-- --> <!-- -->This means that each 1 or 0 can be read or written without the need to move any physical components, but 100% through electrical signaling.</p><p>SSDs are organized into one or more <strong>targets</strong>, each of which contains many <strong>blocks</strong> which each contain some number of <strong>pages</strong>.<!-- --> <!-- -->SSDs read and write data at the page level, meaning they can only read or write full pages at a time.<!-- --> <!-- -->In the SSD below, you can see reads and writes happening via the <strong>lines</strong> between the controller and targets (also called "traces").</p><p>The removal of mechanical components reduces the latency between when a request is made and when the drive can fulfill the request.<!-- --> <!-- -->There is no more waiting around for something to spin.</p><p>We're showing small examples in the visual to make it easier to follow along, but a single SSD is capable of storing multiple terabytes of data.<!-- --> <!-- -->For example, say each page holds 4096 bits of data (4k).<!-- --> <!-- -->Now, say each block stores 16k pages, each target stores 16k blocks, and our device has 8 targets.<!-- --> <!-- -->This comes out to <code>4k * 16k * 16k * 8 = 8,796,093,022,208</code> bits, or 8 terabytes.<!-- --> <!-- -->We could increase the capacity of this drive by adding more targets or packing more pages in per block.</p><p>Here's a visualization to help us see the difference between the latency of a random read on an <span>HDD</span> vs <span>SSD</span>.<!-- --> <!-- -->A random read on an SSD varies by model, but can execute as fast as 16μs (μs = microsecond, which is one millionth of a second).</p><p>It would be tempting to think that with the removal of mechanical parts, the organization of data on an SSD no longer matters.<!-- --> <!-- -->Since we don't have to wait for things to spin, we can access any data at any location with perfect speed, right?</p><p>Not quite.</p><p>There are other factors that impact the performance of IO operations on an SSD.<!-- --> <!-- -->We won't cover them all here, but two that we will discuss are <strong>parallelism</strong> and <strong>garbage collection</strong>.</p><h3 id="ssd-parallelism"><a href="#ssd-parallelism">SSD Parallelism</a></h3><p>Typically, each <strong>target</strong> has a dedicated <strong>line</strong> going from the control unit to the target.<!-- --> <!-- -->This line is what processes reads and writes, and only one page can be communicated by each line at a time.<!-- --> <!-- -->Pages can be communicated on these lines <em>really fast</em>, but it still does take a small slice of time.<!-- --> <!-- -->The organization of data and sequence of reads and writes has a significant impact on how efficiently these lines can be used.</p><p>In the interactive SSD below, we have 4 targets and a set of 8 write operations queued up.<!-- --> <!-- -->You can click the <span>Time IO button</span> to see what happens when we can use the lines in parallel to get these pages written.</p><p>In this case, we wrote 8 pages spread across the 4 targets.<!-- --> <!-- -->Because they were spread out, we were able to leverage parallelism to write 4 at a time in two time slices.</p><p>Compare that with another sequence where the SSD writes all 8 pages to the same target.<!-- --> <!-- -->The SSD can only utilize a single data line for the writes.<!-- --> <!-- -->Again, hit the <span>Time IO button</span> to see the timing.</p><p>Notice how only one line was used and it needed to write sequentially.<!-- --> <!-- -->All the other lines sat dormant.</p><p>This demonstrates that the order in which we read and write data matters for performance.<!-- --> <!-- -->Many software engineers don't have to think about this on a day-to-day basis, but those designing software like MySQL need to pay careful attention to what <a href="https://planetscale.com/blog/btrees-and-database-indexes">structures data is being stored in</a> and how data is laid out on disk.</p><h3 id="ssd-garbage-collection"><a href="#ssd-garbage-collection">SSD Garbage Collection</a></h3><p>The minimum "chunk" of data that can be read from or written to an SSD is the size of a page.<!-- --> <!-- -->Even if you only need a subset of the data within, that is the unit that requests to the drive must be made in.</p><p>Data can be read from a page any number of times.<!-- --> <!-- -->However, writes are a bit different.<!-- --> <!-- -->After a page is written to, it cannot be overwritten with new data until the old data has been explicitly <strong>erased</strong>.<!-- --> <!-- -->The tricky part is, individual pages cannot be erased.<!-- --> <!-- -->When you need to erase data, the entire block must be erased, and afterwards all of the pages within it can be reused.</p><p>Each SSD needs to have an internal algorithm for managing which pages are empty, which are in use, and which are <strong>dirty</strong>.<!-- --> <!-- -->A <strong>dirty</strong> page is one that has been written to but the data is no longer needed and ready to be erased.<!-- --> <!-- -->Data also sometimes needs to be re-organized to allow for new write traffic.<!-- --> <!-- -->The algorithm that manages this is called the <strong>garbage collector</strong>.</p><p>Let's see how this can have an impact by looking at another visualization.<!-- --> <!-- -->In the below SSD, all four of the targets are storing data.<!-- --> <!-- -->Some of the data is <span>dirty, indicated by red text</span>.<!-- --> <!-- -->We want to <span>write</span> 5 pages worth of data to this SSD.<!-- --> <!-- -->If we <span>time this sequence of writes</span>, the SSD can happily write them to free pages with no need for extra garbage collection.<!-- --> <!-- -->There are sufficient unused pages in the first target.</p><p>Now say we have a drive with different data already on it, but we want to <span>write</span> those same 5 pages of data to it.<!-- --> <!-- -->In this drive, we only have 2 pages that are unused, but a number of <span>dirty pages</span>.<!-- --> <!-- -->In order to write 5 pages of data, the SSD will need to spend some time doing garbage collection to make room for the new data.<!-- --> <!-- -->When attempting to <span>time another sequence of writes</span>, some garbage collection will take place to make room for the data, slowing down the write.</p><p>In this case, the drive had to move the two non-dirty pages from the top-left target to new locations.<!-- --> <!-- -->By doing this, it was able to make all of the pages on the top-left target dirty, making it safe to erase that data.<!-- --> <!-- -->This made room for the 5 new pages of data to be written.<!-- --> <!-- -->These additional steps significantly slowed down the performance of the write.</p><p>This shows how the organization of data on the drive can have an impact on performance.<!-- --> <!-- -->When SSDs have a lot of reads, writes, and deletes, we can end up with SSDs that have degraded performance due to garbage collection.<!-- --> <!-- -->Though you may not be aware, busy SSDs do garbage collection tasks regularly, which can slow down other operations.</p><p>These are just two of many reasons why the arrangement of data on a SSD affects its performance.</p><h2 id="storage-in-the-cloud"><a href="#storage-in-the-cloud">Storage in the cloud</a></h2><p>The shift from tape, to disk, to solid state has allowed durable IO performance to accelerate dramatically over the past several decades.<!-- --> <!-- -->However, there is another phenomenon that has caused an additional shift in IO performance: moving to the cloud.</p><p>Though there were companies offering cloud compute services before this, the mass move to cloud gained significant traction when Amazon AWS launched in 2006.<!-- --> <!-- -->Since that time, tens of thousands of companies have moved their app servers and database systems to their cloud and other similar services from Google, Microsoft, and others.</p><p>Though there are many upsides to this trend, there are several downsides.<!-- --> <!-- -->One of these is that servers tend to have less permanence.<!-- --> <!-- -->Users rent (virtualised) servers on arbitrary hardware within gigantic data centers.<!-- --> <!-- -->These servers can get shut down at any time for a variety of reasons - hardware failure, hardware replacement, network disconnects, etc.<!-- --> <!-- -->When building platforms on rented cloud infrastructure, computer systems need to be able to tolerate more frequent failures at any moment.<!-- --> <!-- -->This, along with many engineers' desire for dynamically-scaleable storage volumes has led to a new sub-phenomenon: Separation of <strong>storage</strong> and <strong>compute</strong>.</p><h2 id="separating-storage-from-compute"><a href="#separating-storage-from-compute">Separating storage from compute</a></h2><p>Traditionally, most servers, desktops, laptops, phones and other computing devices have their non-volatile storage directly attached.<!-- --> <!-- -->These are attached with SATA cables, PCIe interfaces, or even built directly into the same SOC as the RAM, CPU, and other components.<!-- --> <!-- -->This is great for speed, but provides the following challenges:</p><ol><li>If the server goes down, the data goes down with it.</li><li>The storage is of a fixed size.</li></ol><p>For application servers, 1. and 2. are typically not a big deal since they work well in ephemeral environments by design.<!-- --> <!-- -->If one goes down, just spin up a new one.<!-- --> <!-- -->They also don't typically need much storage, as most of what they do happens in-memory.</p><p>Databases are a different story.<!-- --> <!-- -->If a server goes down, we don't want to lose our data, and data size grows quickly, meaning we may hit storage limits.<!-- --> <em>Partly</em> due to this, many cloud providers allow you to spin up compute instances with a separately-configurable storage system attached over the network.<!-- --> <!-- -->In other words, using network-attached storage as the default.</p><p>When you create a new server in EC2, the default is typically to attach an EBS network storage volume.<!-- --> <!-- -->Many database services including Amazon RDS, Amazon Aurora, Google Cloud SQL, and PlanetScale rely on these types of storage systems that have compute separated from storage over the network.<!-- --> <!-- -->This provides a nice advantage in the that the storage volume can be dynamically resized as data grows and shrinks.<!-- --> <!-- -->It also means that if a server goes down, the data is still safe, and can be re-attached to a different server.<!-- --> <!-- -->This simplicity has come at a cost, however.</p><h2 id="local-vs-network-storage"><a href="#local-vs-network-storage">Local vs network storage</a></h2><p>Consider the following simple configuration.<!-- --> <!-- -->In it, we have a server with a CPU, RAM, and direct-attached NVMe SSD.<!-- --> <!-- -->NVMe SSDs are a type of solid state disk that use the non-volatile memory host controller interface specification for blazing-fast IO speed and great bandwidth.<!-- --> <!-- -->In such a setup, the <span>round trip from CPU to memory (RAM)</span> takes about 100 nanoseconds (a nanosecond is 1 billionth of a second).<!-- --> <span>A round trip from the CPU to a locally-attached NVMe SSD</span> takes about 50,000 nanoseconds (50 microseconds).</p><p>This makes it pretty clear that it's best to keep as much data in memory as possible for faster IO times.<!-- --> <!-- -->However, we still need disk because (A) memory is more expensive and (B) we need to store our data somewhere permanent.<!-- --> <!-- -->As slow as it may seem here, a locally-attached NVMe SSD is about as fast as it gets for modern storage.</p><p>Let's compare this to the <span>speed of a network-attached storage volume</span>, such as EBS.<!-- --> <!-- -->Read and write requires a short network round trip within a data center.<!-- --> <!-- -->The round trip time is significantly worse, taking about 250,000 nanoseconds (250 microseconds, or 0.25 milliseconds).</p><p>Using the same cutting-edge SSD now takes an <em>order of magnitude</em> longer to fulfill individual read and write requests.<!-- --> <!-- -->When we have large amounts of sequential IO, the negative impact of this can be reduced, but not eliminated.<!-- --> <!-- -->We have introduced significant <em>latency</em> deterioration for every time we need to hit our storage system.</p><p>Another issue with network-attached storage in the cloud comes in the form of limiting IOPS.<!-- --> <!-- -->Many cloud providers that use this model, including AWS and Google Cloud, limit the amount of IO operations you can send over the wire.<!-- --> <!-- -->By default, a GP3 EBS instance on Amazon allows you to send 3000 IOPS per-second, with an additional pool that can be built up to allow for occasional bursts.<!-- --> <!-- -->The following visual shows how this works.<!-- --> <!-- -->Note that the burst balance size is smaller here than in reality to make it easier to see.</p><p>If instead you have your storage attached directly to your compute instance, there are no artificial limits placed on IO operations.<!-- --> <!-- -->You can read and write as fast as the hardware will allow for.</p><p>For as many steps as we've taken forward in IO performance over the years, this seems like a step in the wrong direction.<!-- --> <!-- -->This separation buys some nice conveniences, but at what cost to performance?</p><p>How do we overcome issue 1 (data durability) and 2 (drive scalability) while keeping good IOPS performance?</p><p>Issue 1 can be overcome with replication.<!-- --> <!-- -->Instead of relying on a single server to store all data, we can replicate it onto several computers.<!-- --> <!-- -->One common way of doing this is to have one server act as the primary, which will receive all write requests.<!-- --> <!-- -->Then 2 or more additional servers get all the data replicated to them.<!-- --> <!-- -->With the data in three places, the likelihood of losing data becomes very small.</p><p>Let's look at concrete numbers.<!-- --> <!-- -->As a made up value, say in a given month, there is a 1% chance of a server failing.<!-- --> <!-- -->With a single server, this means we have a 1% chance of losing our data each month.<!-- --> <!-- -->This is an unacceptable for any serious business purpose.<!-- --> <!-- -->However, with three servers, this goes down to 1% × 1% × 1% = 0.0001% chance (1 in one million).<!-- --> <!-- -->At PlanetScale the protection is actually far stronger than even this, as we automatically detect and replace failed nodes in your cluster.<!-- --> <!-- -->We take frequent and reliable backups of the data in your database for added protection.</p><p>Problem 2. can be solved, though it takes a bit more manual intervention when working with directly-attached SSDs.<!-- --> <!-- -->We need to ensure that we monitor and get alerted when our disk approaches capacity limits, and then have tools to easily increase capacity when needed.<!-- --> <!-- -->With such a feature, we can have data permanence, scalability, and blazing fast performance. This is exactly what PlanetScale has built with Metal.</p><p>Planetscale just announced <strong><a href="https://planetscale.com/blog/announcing-metal">Metal</a></strong>, an industry-leading solution to this problem.</p><p>With Metal, you get a full-fledged Vitess+MySQL cluster set up, with each MySQL instance running with a direct-attached NVMe SSD drive.<!-- --> <!-- -->Each Metal cluster comes with a primary and two replicas by default for extremely durable data.<!-- --> <!-- -->We allow you to resize your servers with larger drives with just a few clicks of a button when you run up against storage limits.<!-- --> <!-- -->Behind the scenes, we handle spinning up new nodes and migrating your data from your old instances to the new ones with zero downtime.</p><p>Perhaps most importantly, with a Metal database, there is no artificial cap on IOPS.<!-- --> <!-- -->You can perform IO operations with minimal latency, and hammer it as hard as you want without being throttled or paying for expensive IOPS classes on your favorite cloud provider.</p><p>If you want the ultimate in performance and scalability, <strong><a href="https://planetscale.com/metal">try Metal today</a></strong>.</p></article></div>]]></description>

                  <p>There's literally no shame in this. Jobs are just value exchange. Job applications are a proposal, to say, here's what I can offer you. If you're very honest about that, and about what you're looking for in return, they can make more informed decisions. Everyone's life is vastly different, there's no shame in declaring what you have to offer (edit: and what you're looking for). Everyone is better at some things and worse at others. This is the basis of the economy.</p>

                  <p>I think your network is the best place to look for this sort of work. Sometimes people will reach out to me with short term projects which is the best way to get gigs like this. Maybe start looking at your colleagues on linkedin, see what they are up to, and think of ways to contribute to what they are working on. The best people to contact in this scenario are leadership and decision makers. A SWE II isn't gonna help you much but a CTO at an early stage startup might be a good person to send a DM if they are friends with you (or even if they aren't!) :)</p>

                  <p>Having the required technical skills is only 50% of the requirement (and realistically even less than that). The harder battle is being a good salesman. Push yourself and your services at every opportunity. Send mass emails to friends and old collegues. Write daily puke-inducing posts on LinkedIn. Write blog posts and make toy Github projects with "looking for work" blurbs at the top of each one. Set a goal to post N times a day on X/Threads/LinkedIn/Reddit/wherever else you can think of, and hit those targets. Keep doing all of this for an extended period of time and the leads will start flowing in. Then you need to start putting even more effort into closing those leads and signing contracts.</p>

                  <p>In a past startup, we had at least one person apply to our regular job postings with a cover that transparently said "I know this is a full-time, long-term posting, but I really want to be a contractor for a bounded time." Since it was a great fit and they were available right away (and we urgently needed more people), we made the "hire" and ended up working together for a while. Only worked because it was quite transparent and up front in the application though.</p>

Now you’d have to keep an ongoing arrangement with them for future support.</p><p>It’s a similar issue with long term devs too. Employers hoping to squeeze their devs for 40 hours a week consistently are going to be very disappointed if they found out how much their devs actually work. What you’re really paying them for is to stick around so when shit hits the fan or you need new features fast you already have the best people for the job ready to go, no need to hire some contractor and go through an onboarding.</p></div></td></tr>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>New York’s skyscrapers soar above a century-old steam network that still warms the city. While the rest of the world moved to hot water, Manhattanites still buy steam by the megapound.</p><article><div role="presentation"><p>Since 1882, Manhattan has delivered steam into the homes and businesses of its citizens. It is used for: pressing linens at The Waldorf Astoria; cleaning crockery and heating food in restaurants; washing clothes at dry cleaners; sterilizing medical equipment at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital; by the Metropolitan Museum of Art to control the humidity levels and temperatures around its artwork. And it is used by Manhattanites, in both iconic buildings and regular apartment blocks, to heat their space and water.</p>



<!-- --><p>Steam functions like any other utility: produced centrally, metered, and delivered into homes and businesses through a 105-mile-long grid of pipework. Like electricity, sewage, and water, it plays an integral part in the daily operation of the city.</p>



<!-- --><p>Today, the Manhattan steam system is responsible for heating 1.8 billion square feet of residential, 700 million square feet of commercial, and 90 million square feet of industrial floorspace. This represents over three quarters of Manhattan’s total residential footprint.</p>



<!-- --><p>Steam enabled the growth of Manhattan, providing efficient heating to an increasingly vertical city. Many other cities have adopted district-level heating systems, but very few use steam to distribute that energy. Why does some infrastructure survive while others become obsolete?&nbsp;</p>



<!-- --><h3><strong>A short history of heating</strong></h3>



<!-- --><p>Heating represents around <!-- --><a href="https://www.iea.org/energy-system/buildings/heating">half of all global end-user energy consumption</a>. Much of this energy is spent warming homes, offices, and water – for cooking, cleaning, and washing – but roughly half goes toward various industrial uses and a smaller percentage toward agriculture. Keeping spaces warm is amongst the most foundational uses of energy there is.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>Before modern central heating, keeping homes warm was inefficient, inconvenient, and sometimes deadly. Most residential buildings would be centered around a fireplace or stove, often burning wood, coal, surplus crops, or dung. Traditional fireplaces are immensely inefficient, <!-- --><a href="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/wood-and-pellet-heating">drawing in 300 cubic feet of air per minute</a> for combustion and expelling up to 85 percent – along with the heat – up the chimney. They are inconvenient because the fuel source needs to be regularly replenished: felling, hauling, and splitting firewood could take <!-- --><a href="https://www.historiaagraria.com/FILE/articulos/RHA77_warde.pdf">up to two months of human labor</a> per person per year. And they are deadly because these sorts of solid fuels, full of impurities, are highly polluting. <!-- --><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352710223020284">A recent study found</a> that a fireplace pumps out 58 milligrams of particles under 2.5 microns in diameter (PM2.5s) per kilogram of firewood burnt. This means that every hour you spend in a room with a fireplace burning wood reduces your lifespan by about 18 minutes, equivalent to smoking 1.5 cigarettes..<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>Efficiency and pollution concerns motivated the rediscovery and refinement of central heating systems, moving the production of heat away from its consumption. James Watt laid the groundwork in the late 1700s, connecting a system of pipes to a central boiler in his own home.</p>



<!-- --><p>In 1805, William Strutt heated cold air using coal and distributed it throughout homes using ducts; around the same time, some wealthier homes in France began using similar fire-tube hot air furnaces.</p>



<!-- --><p>By 1863, <!-- --><a href="https://www.radrestore.co.uk/about/history">the radiator had taken definitive form</a>, perhaps the most significant breakthrough in modern household heating. Running steam through pipes that have been folded over many times allows for a large amount of surface area in a compact space. The heat is then transferred from the steam into the ambient environment via convection and by directly radiating into the room. Individual radiators can also be fitted with valves, which allows for heating control room-by-room.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>While the radiator allowed for much better distribution of heat within a building, each building needed its own boiler. But on-site boilers, especially those for larger buildings, came with both economic and ergonomic limitations. Steam heating required large boilers, coal storage areas, and extensive piping systems, which take up valuable floor space. As the systems became more advanced, they often also became more complex, necessitating skilled technicians for installation and maintenance.</p>



<!-- --><p>Coal logistics presented its own set of problems. The regular delivery, storage, and handling of large quantities of coal is labor- and space-intensive: heating the Empire State Building would need more than 45 tons of coal per day, roughly two shipping containers’ worth. <!-- --><a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/thomas-edison-tinkerer/">Thomas Edison’s</a> first electric power station on Pearl Street opened in 1890 and needed upwards of 20 tons of coal each day. All this coal needed to be moved across bridges or via boat onto Manhattan Island for storage in a city where space was increasingly at a premium. The <!-- --><a href="https://stuffnobodycaresabout.com/2023/01/23/soaring-new-york-real-estate-values-from-1790-to-1889/">price of prime parcels of land increased tenfold</a> between the 1790s and the 1880s, spiking from $400 an acre in 1825 to over $1 million an acre at the end of the century (over $30 million in today’s dollars).<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>Nor is all coal created equal. Boilers and furnaces need an expensive class of coal to burn hot enough. <!-- --><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthracite">Anthracite coal</a>, with its high carbon content (between 92 and 98 percent) and few impurities, burns hot and clean but is difficult to light: one exasperated user declared that ‘if the world should take fire, the Lehigh coal mine would be the safest retreat, the last place to burn’. (This would have been a bad strategy: in 1962, the anthracite seam under Centralia, PA – 25 miles to the west of Lehigh County – caught on fire and is still burning today.)<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bituminous_coal">Bituminous coal</a> is much softer, with a lower carbon content (between 45 and 86 percent); it therefore burns less energetically and pollutes much more. <!-- --><a href="https://www.ageofinvention.xyz/p/age-of-invention-how-coal-really">And all coal needs to be stored, handled, and its ashes cleared out</a> regularly.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>The unpleasantness of soot and smoke led US cities to begin to legislate against it in the 1880s, although these restrictions were often ignored. When strikes drove up the price of anthracite in 1902 and some New York City plants switched to bituminous coal, the resulting smoke choked the city, violated local ordinances, <!-- --><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1902/06/07/archives/smoke-pall-hangs-over-the-metropolis-the-use-of-bituminous-coal-on.html">and alarmed residents</a>. Pollution encouraged invention: from the 1830s to the 1880s, the ‘patent office . . . groaned with inventions to save fuel, abolish smoke, evaporate water and utilize steam . . . still leaving a great need unsupplied’, <!-- --><a href="https://www.waterworkshistory.us/DH/1880HollySteam1.pdf">according to a contemporary account</a>.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><h3><strong>The growth of Manhattan in the nineteenth century</strong></h3>



<!-- --><p>Between 1850 and 1900, New York’s population ballooned. Manhattan alone <!-- --><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Manhattan">grew from 515,000 to 1.8 million residents</a>. This increase led to severe overcrowding, with population densities in some areas reaching <!-- --><a href="https://www.loc.gov/resource/g3804n.ct001463r/?r=0.41,0.208,0.216,0.179,0">632,000 people per square mile</a>, ten times higher <!-- --><a href="https://www.bensouthwood.co.uk/p/developing-palo-alto-is-worth-1-trillion">than today</a>.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>Overcrowding led to both moral and public health concerns, and anti-slum legislation was introduced to try to improve living conditions. This made space in Manhattan still more scarce. Elevated train lines, such as the Ninth Avenue Line, which opened in 1878, allowed the city’s effective size to increase and the partial suburbanization of the outer city. But fares weren’t cheap enough to allow low-wage laborers to commute regularly to and from the new communities forming uptown. If the city were to continue to grow, it would need to build upward.</p>



<!-- --><p>Two major innovations allowed the development of ever-taller buildings. Physically climbing up stairs – bringing food, water, and fuel with you – places a practical limit on how high a building can practically be: as high as land prices rose, no Ancient Roman, medieval Byzantine, or Hausmannian residential building went above six storeys. The introduction of the safety elevator, by Elisha Otis in 1852, made taller buildings practical and desirable. Otis’s design incorporated a safety brake that would engage if the hoisting cable broke, alleviating fears of catastrophic falls.</p>



<!-- --><p>Concurrent with safety elevators was the use of steel building frames. Traditional brick and stone structures face several limitations that prevent them from exceeding around 12 storeys, the most important of which is weight distribution: as a building gets taller, the weight of the upper floors puts enormous pressure on the floors below.</p>



<!-- --><p>Advancements in steel production, including the Bessemer process – oxidizing impurities in molten iron by blowing air through it – made it both affordable and economical to use steel frames, which allowed for a ten times higher strength-to-weight ratio. Designing the building around a skeleton of vertical steel columns and horizontal I-beams allowed buildings to redistribute their weight into this structure, freeing up tensile pressure from the walls and floors. This meant that the rest of the building could be made from lighter non-load-bearing materials, making it possible to build higher still.</p>



<!-- --><p><a href="https://skyscraper.org/skyline/new-york-1876-1900/">So New York shot up.</a> In 1890, the tallest building reached 18 storeys. By 1899, the Park Row Building stretched to 31 stories, and in 1908, the Singer Building soared even higher to 41 stories. Vertical expansion allowed the city to create more residential and commercial space, but that space needed to be heated, powered, and watered.<!-- --></p>

<!-- --><h3><strong>The New York Steam Company</strong></h3>



<!-- --><p>To solve this, New York turned to district heating, an invention of Birdsill Holly (1820–94), a self-made man from Lockport, New York. Holly <!-- --><a href="https://www.adscomfg.com/wp-content/uploads/The-Life-and-Times-of-Birdsill-Holly.pdf">understood the problems of nineteenth century cities deeply</a>. As urban populations swelled, fire risk became catastrophic: large parts of Manhattan would be destroyed in three great fires between 1776 and 1845. Early hand-pumped fire engines could deliver only 30 gallons of water per minute. <!-- --><a href="https://www.arct.cam.ac.uk/system/files/documents/chs-vol.19-pp.87-to-106.pdf">Among Holly’s earliest patents</a> were water pumps such as an ‘elliptical rotary pump’ – the precursor for his <!-- --><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20240522030947/https://www.engine3.org/Silsby/silsbyhistory.html">steam-powered fire engine</a> in 1856.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>His ‘Holly System of Direct Water Supply and Fire Protection for Cities, Towns and Villages’ provided a constant supply of water at pressure to both homes and fire hydrants, lowering costs and removing the need for reservoirs and standpipes. It was so successful that 23 other cities copied it, without crediting Holly, and were later forced by the U.S. Supreme Court to pay him damages. In the 1870s, he began work on a skyscraper project in Niagara Falls, which he then took to Long Island, suggesting that overcrowding could be improved by building upward. Mocked as ‘the farmer from the west’, he abandoned the project altogether and went home to Lockport.</p>



<!-- --><p>Holly returned to plumbing. Drawing from his research in steam-powered pumps, pipework, and urban density, he began to create plans for a district-level heating system. If he could distribute steam to buildings as he had water, then multiple buildings could be heated by a single boiler, reducing fire risk and centralizing heating logistics. He began by running steam through one and a half inch pipes, later upgraded to three inch pipes supported by wooden trenches insulated with <!-- --><a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/the-asbestos-times/">asbestos</a>. The steam would be produced in a boiler in his basement at 31 Chestnut Street and passed across his garden into the houses of his neighbors.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>By 1877, he launched the first practical district-scale test of his system. Over the course of the year, the network was extended to the surrounding area as Holly ironed out the problems and registered customers. Each stage necessitated new inventions: valves used to draw steam off the mains, regulators to stabilize pressure, steam traps to handle condensation, brackets to handle the thermal expansion of the pipes, and meters to measure the flow rate and bill customers accordingly.</p>



<!-- --><p>By the time winter had arrived, 20 houses had been registered. By this stage, the network encompassed three miles of pipe, supplied by three boilers, at a pressure of&nbsp; 25 to 30 pounds per square inch. <!-- --><a href="https://archive.org/details/cihm_18645/page/n9/mode/2up">According to a contemporary account</a>, ‘all the houses, to which steam had been supplied during the winter, had been most comfortably heated, and the discomforts of the old methods done away with . . . heat could be supplied at a much lower cost.’<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>The test was a success, so he incorporated the Holly Steam Combination Company, patenting his more than 50 inventions and exporting district steam heating to other cities. By 1882 at least twenty Holly steam systems were in operation, including: Denver, CO; Auburn, NY; Troy, NY; Springfield, MA; Detroit, MI; and Hartford and New Haven, CT. (The oldest, in Denver, <!-- --><a href="https://difcdn.denverinfill.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/19055143/Denvers-128-Year-Old-Steam-System.pdf">has been running continuously since 1880</a>.) By far the biggest system, however, was in New York City.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>Manhattan had some municipal utilities already: in the 1830s, the city had begun to lay water pipes, bringing fresh water from the Croton River in Westchester County through 41 miles of enclosed aqueduct. In the 1850s, private companies such as the Manhattan Gas Light Company started to run gas mains down the avenues, replacing oil lamps across the city.</p>



<!-- --><p>But the idea of distributing steam at city scale was a little more audacious, even in the context of Gilded Age America. It was an associate of John D. Rockefeller, an entrepreneur and ‘popular dandy with a flair for equipage and flowered vests’ called Wallace Andrews, along with his engineering partner, Charles E. Emery, who came across Holly’s designs and decided to implement them in New York City. Andrews worked to arrange the financing and convince the New York City council to permit the development of the steam system. (A task made easier by Edison, who was already digging up the streets to install electrical cabling; Emery and Edison <!-- --><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120228162040/http://www.coned.com/history/steam.asp">even crossed paths underground</a>.)<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>In 1882, its first year of operation, <!-- --><a href="https://time.com/archive/6757202/business-steam-condensed/">New York Steam</a> made $200,000 (about six million dollars adjusted for inflation) in gross revenue. An early steam station was built at 172–176 Greenwich St, on the site of today’s World Trade Center memorial; it contained 64 boilers of 250 horsepower each, distributed across four floors. Coal was brought into the upper levels of the building, where it fed the boilers through a chute; ashes were dropped into the basement of the building in the same fashion. By 1884 the Company had five miles of pipes in active use – feeding steam to 250 consumers, from the Battery in the south up to Murray St, by the modern-day Civic Center – and was profitable.<!-- --></p>

<!-- --><p>Replacing individual boilers with a central system had significant town planning and public health benefits. In a city as dense as Manhattan, coal logistics was a growing concern – <!-- --><a href="https://dn720003.ca.archive.org/0/items/fiftyyearsofnewy00unse/fiftyyearsofnewy00unse.pdf#page=140">the New York Steam Corporation estimated</a> that its central system displaced 1.2 million tons of coal and the smoke from more than 2,500 chimneys, requiring 700 five-ton truckloads per day for 300 days per year to handle the coal and ash – and the risk of dying in a fire was increasing (as were insurance premiums).<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>Andrews himself would die in a house fire in 1899. But the system he helped create outlived him and proved remarkably flexible, adapting to the city’s rapid growth both uptown and skyward. As New York expanded, numerous new buildings tapped into its growing steam network, saving them the costs and complexity of building their own heating systems. Each new building made the system that much more efficient because the costs of laying down the pipework and moving the coal could be amortized over more customers’ bills.&nbsp;</p>



<!-- --><p>The first customers were mostly office buildings, such as the First National Bank at Broadway and Wall Street, but users included busy restaurants (one serving ten thousand meals per day), electrical power generators, laundries, and public baths. Network steam was even used to melt snow in the streets. Most of the Art Deco skyscrapers of the 1920s and 1930s were supplied by the New York Steam Company, including the Standard Oil Building, the Ritz Tower Building, the New York Life Insurance Company, the Paramount Building, the Chrysler Building, the Waldorf-Astoria, the Rockefeller Center, and the Empire State.</p>

<!-- --><p>In 1931 – emerging from the financially turbulent 1910s, when the company went into receivership in 1918 – <!-- --><a href="https://time.com/archive/6757202/business-steam-condensed/">its annual profits had reached $2 million</a>. By 1932, it was the largest district heating system in the world, with 65 miles of pipes, bringing heat to more than 2,500 buildings.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><h3><strong>The modern New York steam system</strong></h3>



<!-- --><p>Today, the network, now owned by utilities giant Consolidated Edison – ConEd – operates four steam production sites in Manhattan and one in Queens. They also purchase additional steam from a 322 megawatt plant in Brooklyn, which is managed by a separate company. ConEd’s largest facility sits along the East River, taking up the lion’s share of a city block on 14th Street. At this plant, a dozen massive boilers heat water to approximately 177 degrees celsius and push it into the network at 150 pounds per square inch (roughly equivalent to ten atmospheres).</p>

<!-- --><p>The scale of all this is considerable. The six boiler sites together have a total capacity of roughly <!-- --><a href="https://www.nyiso.com/documents/20142/33938587/20221021%20-%20Steam%20Future%20Overview_NYISO%20(002).pdf">11 and a half million pounds of steam per hour</a>; at peak times they use over nine million. Every gallon of water produces just over eight pounds of steam, which means that the system consumes nearly two Olympic swimming pools’ worth of water per hour during the winter.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>Once heated, steam is sent out from plants through large pipes called mains, which are usually between two and three feet in diameter, before spreading through a network of 105 miles of smaller pipes latticed under the city’s streets.</p>



<!-- --><p>The older pipework is made of cast iron, often still coated in the asbestos in which Emery clad them, which can cause problems during regular maintenance and when the pipes crack. (When the last major rupture occurred in 2023, the city shut down seven blocks and washed neighboring buildings and streets out of ‘an abundance of caution’.) New pipes are made from a carbon steel alloy and wrapped in insulation, usually mineral wool, and sit within prefabricated concrete ducts, which both lessens heat loss during transit and also prevents nearby pipes and wiring from being affected.</p>



<!-- --><p>Most of these pipes<!-- --><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Works-Anatomy-City-Kate-Ascher/dp/0143112708"> sit deeper than the other utilities, anywhere from four to 15 feet below street level</a>. The deepest mains pipe runs below the Park Avenue Tunnel, 30 feet underneath the trains shuttling commuters to and from the Bronx and Grand Central. The pipes are accessible through manhole covers in the street, with special telescopic tooling used by workers to open and close the valves that regulate system pressure. Individual sections of pipe are welded together and bound into the concrete with strips of metal called anchors. Metal expands and contracts when heat levels change, so at various points along the mains, the pipes run through expansion joints to absorb this movement safely.<!-- --></p>

(This is structurally similar to electricity grids, where current is transmitted over longer distances at a higher voltage and then reduced at a local substation for local distribution into homes and offices.) Once the steam has passed through the meter and the pressure-reduction substation, most buildings then pipe it through a heat exchanger for distribution into individual apartments and rooms.<!-- --></p>

A thin, flat metal plate with a precisely machined hole in the center, an orifice plate is set within the pipeline, perpendicular to the direction of flow.

All apartment building connections pay a standing service charge of $3,555.43 per month. Usage fees are then added on top, paying anywhere from $11.35 per megapound in the summer to $35.013 during peak season.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p><a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Steam-Buildings-Addresses/s7tr-dj9w/about_data">According to data</a> from the NYC Department of Buildings, 201 East 62nd Street, a mid-century residential building in Midtown with 70 apartments, consumed approximately 5,962 megapounds of steam in 2021. Its steam service cost the building roughly $16,741.23 per month or $239.16 per apartment per month. Lincoln Towers, at 150 West End Avenue, built around the same time, has 454 apartments and pays no less than $47,370.80 per month for its 19,483 megapounds of steam, or $104.34 per apartment per month; the pricing structure strongly rewards density.<!-- --><sup id="ref-2"></sup></p>



<!-- --><p>A large part of the engineering challenge in maintaining the network is managing how the pressure changes as steam moves throughout the system, being drained into buildings as it goes. Engineers can control the inbound pressure for any given customer very accurately using valves on either side of the service valve and monitor usage across the system with sensors. When the pressure gets too high, valves open and vent the steam through a grate, delighting tourists and enraging taxi drivers. If the pressure is too high for a sustained period, ConEd shuts off some of the boilers. If the pressure is too low, ConEd can increase the supply by switching on new boilers or closing valves elsewhere. Large parts of this feedback mechanism are now automated, and modern electronic sensors and high-precision valves allow the system as a whole to run at a high level of efficiency: <!-- --><a href="https://documents.dps.ny.gov/public/Common/ViewDoc.aspx?DocRefId=%7B88298170-D229-4D46-B2B7-2A6AA5B12A03%7D">60 percent, end-to-end</a>.<!-- --><sup id="ref-3"></sup></p>



<!-- --><p>As steam cools, it condenses&nbsp;into water droplets called <!-- --><em>condensate</em>, a substance that accumulates at low points in the piping system. Condensate poses several significant problems. It absorbs oxygen and carbon dioxide, which makes it highly corrosive. The difficulty of accessing the underground infrastructure, especially in older parts of the network, can make this corrosion costly to repair and, in some cases, highly dangerous. Condensate left in pipes can freeze during the winter, leading to blockages and bursts.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>But the most dramatic failure is called a <!-- --><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_hammer"><em>waterhammer</em></a><em>.</em> Sometimes the condensate can form a ‘slug’ of water that fills the entire cross-section of the pipe. When a slug comes into contact with the high-pressure steam, it gets pushed through the piping and accelerated to ridiculous velocities, often reaching over 100 miles per hour (50 meters per second).&nbsp;<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>When this fast-moving water reaches a closed valve, sharp bend, or other obstruction in the pipe, it crashes into whatever it has found, producing a spike of pressure much higher than the standard operating pressure of the system.

<!-- --><h3><strong>District heating in the twenty-first century</strong></h3>



<!-- --><p>Steam was a logical choice of heat transfer medium at the turn of the twentieth century, since there was a ready source of it from existing power plants, and its higher temperatures meant it was useful for industrial processes as well as domestic needs. Steam rises, making it a natural choice for tall buildings in dense urban environments. Although steam loses heat as it travels – especially through older systems with poor insulation – its initial high temperature and high energy content mean it can deliver sufficient heat over longer distances.</p>



<!-- --><p>By the 1930s, designers of new systems had switched from using steam to hot water to carry heat. Hot water is now the preferred medium for several reasons.</p>



<!-- --><p>Water systems distribute heat via hot water at temperatures as high as 180 degrees celsius (under a high 147.9 pounds per square inch of pressure so that it doesn’t turn to steam) and as low as 40. Water produces a much higher operating <!-- --><em>efficienc</em>y, measured as the ratio of usable heat delivered to customers to the total energy used at the heat source. Lower temperatures mean a smaller heat differential between the water and the ambient environment, which means less heat loss overall. Similarly, insulation materials are generally more effective at lower temperatures since thermal conductivity tends to increase with temperature. All in all, steam systems usually lose 10-25 percent of their heat during distribution; low temperature water systems can get this as low as 3-5 percent.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>Lower temperatures and pressures have other benefits: they reduce the risk of high-pressure accidents and reduce the risk of leaks, meaning easier, safer – and therefore cheaper – system installation and maintenance.</p>



<!-- --><p>Managing condensate also adds much complexity. Condensate needs to be separated from the steam and drained away or pumped through a return pipe back to the boilers to be reused. A majority (usually 50–60 percent) of the capital costs of district heating systems are in the pipework and pumps, which can make return pipes far too expensive to use for larger systems. But draining away the condensate causes a loss of 15 percent of the total energy input, which harms operating efficiency.</p>



<!-- --><p>Hot-water systems also allow for easier integration with renewable energy sources since water can easily be heated to a sub-boiling temperature using an electric-powered immersion heater. <!-- --><a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/taming-the-stars/">Nuclear power plants</a> famously use a lot of water&nbsp;– <!-- --><a href="https://smartwatermagazine.com/news/membracon/nuclear-power-and-water-consumption">between 1,514 and&nbsp; 2,725 liters of water per megawatt-hour</a>, <!-- --><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_water_reactor">of which roughly 15 percent is turned into steam</a> – to cool their reactors. Rand reactors in Beznau, Switzerland, and Haiyang, China <!-- --><a href="https://www.powermag.com/district-heating-supply-from-nuclear-power-plants/">already provide hundreds of gigawatt hours</a> of heat output per year to district heating systems. Another source might be data centers, which convert almost all of their electrical power input into heat. An individual large data center can produce 20–50 megawatts of heat; in 2023, global data centers consumed 7.4 gigawatts of power in total, <!-- --><a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/who-we-are/what-london-assembly-does/questions-mayor/find-an-answer/london-annual-energy-usage">enough energy to heat London</a>. Some new developments are even using <!-- --><a href="https://www.newcivilengineer.com/innovative-thinking/harnessing-heat-from-the-tube-11-05-2020/">residual heat from the London Underground</a> via heat pumps to power their district heating systems.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>Besides their natural efficiency and amenability to using a variety of renewable heat sources, water-based systems have another interesting benefit: water has a <!-- --><em>thermal capacity</em> 2.08 times greater than steam at 100 degrees, which means that it stores twice as much heat per unit mass. This capacity allows water-based systems to capture energy during periods of low electricity demand or high renewable generation and discharge it as heat later, acting as a form of city-wide energy storage. Using a city’s heating system as a battery is not just useful for the electricity grid, it also enhances the overall efficiency of district heating networks since the networks are able to heat their water when electricity prices are cheaper.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>There are now tens of thousands of district heating systems across the world, especially in Northern and Eastern Europe. Helsinki (870 miles), Copenhagen (over 1,000 miles), Stockholm (1,200 miles), and Vienna (over 750 miles) are all heavy users of district heating. Former Soviet states, with their long history of centralized planning and heating, are particularly reliant: <!-- --><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210203195340/https://www.mos.ru/en/news/item/85762073/">Moscow’s network alone extends over 10,000 miles</a>. These systems are used by a large percentage of cities’ citizens: Copenhagen provides more than 99 percent of the city’s heating needs via district heating, and the Moscow United Energy Company provides heat to 90 percent of Moscow residents.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>In Britain, there are 2,000 heating systems that serve more than one building, more than one third of which are in London. This represents around two percent of UK heat. Perhaps the most famous UK system was a hot-water system in Pimlico, which was opened in 1950 and drew waste heat from Battersea Power Station, providing heat for over 3,000 homes. That system still functions today, although <!-- --><a href="https://www.westminster.gov.uk/housing/pdhu">the City of Westminster is considering</a> refurbishing or closing it due to its age and carbon intensity.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>Some systems <!-- --><a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/252860/de-steaming-project-nears-completion/">are moving away from steam</a>, and new systems are likely to run on hot water. But engineering is the science of the art of trade-offs, and steam does have its benefits. Steam moves around by itself, so it doesn’t need to be pumped to where it’s wanted; water systems have to pump the water back. Steam systems that drain their condensate require roughly half the amount of pipework. And many industrial processes require steam directly. Thus, there may still be circumstances where steam is preferred.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><h3><strong>Where district heating makes sense</strong></h3>



<!-- --><p>District heating is a truly district-level technology. It needs a high density of heat demand: heat loss and infrastructure costs generally make it unviable below a linear heat density (heat sold per meter of network pipe) of two to three megawatt hours per meter per year. This corresponds to a minimum density of roughly 12 dwellings per acre (about 30 dwellings per hectare), <!-- --><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/land-use-change-statistics-2021-to-2022/land-use-change-statistics-new-residential-addresses-2021-to-2022">approximately the average for new suburban developments in the UK</a>, but a fairly high level of density for American suburban development: R1 residential zoning in Los Angeles, with its minimum lot size of 0.114 acres, wouldn’t make the cut, <!-- --><a href="https://laist.com/news/housing-homelessness/heres-how-las-suburban-style-zoning-contributes-to-racial-disparities-uc-berkeley-study">ruling out three quarters of all residential land in the city</a>.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>District heating systems therefore target smaller, denser, developments: housing estates, central business districts, government complexes, and campuses. Many systems are anchored around hospitals, universities, or industrial facilities, which give a reliable base load demand helping to nudge viability upward.</p>



<!-- --><p>But the upfront capital costs are high: according to <!-- --><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a802b44e5274a2e8ab4e95d/heat_networks.pdf">one 2014 study</a>, British district heating networks cost on the order of £1,242 per meter of piping. The dysfunction of infrastructure development in the Anglophone world, with <!-- --><a href="https://transitcosts.com/">its high construction costs</a> and <!-- --><a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/why-britain-doesnt-build/">baroque planning regimes</a>, only compounds these costs.

However, if district heating is to thrive, it will likely need significant policy support and financial incentives to overcome these initial barriers.<!-- --><sup id="ref-4"></sup></p>



<!-- --><p>New York City’s municipal steam system is an iconic anachronism: a fascinating part of the city’s daily life and visual language, a foundational part of its history, and a system that has been exported and refined worldwide. It was an essential technology for its time as the buildings of Manhattan began to reach up and nudge the sky even higher. Future cities likely won’t be powered by hundreds of miles of steam pipes, but significant parts of them may well be heated and cooled by district systems pumping water through highly insulated pipework, stretching out like tentacles under the streets.</p>

<p>Being able to apply statistics is like having a secret superpower.</p>

<p>Where most people see averages, you see confidence intervals.</p>

<p>When someone says “7 is greater than 5”, you declare that they’re really the same.</p>

<p>In a cacophony of noise, you hear a cry for help.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.evanmiller.org/images/formulas/superman.jpg" height="280">
</p>

<p>Unfortunately, not enough programmers have this superpower. That’s a shame, because the application of statistics can almost always enhance the display and interpretation of data.</p><p>As my modest contribution to developer-kind, I’ve collected together the statistical formulas that I find to be most useful; this page presents them all in one place, a sort of statistical cheat-sheet for the practicing programmer.</p>

<p>Most of these formulas can be found in Wikipedia, but others are buried in journal articles or in professors’ web pages. They are all classical (not Bayesian), and to motivate them I have added concise commentary. I’ve also added links and references, so that even if you’re unfamiliar with the underlying concepts, you can go out and learn more. Wearing a red cape is optional.</p>

<h2>1. Formulas For Reporting Averages</h2>

<p>One of the first programming lessons in any language is to compute an average. But rarely does anyone stop to ask: what does the average actually tell us about the underlying data?</p>

<h3>1.1 Corrected Standard Deviation</h3>

<p>The standard deviation is a single number that reflects how <em>spread out</em> the data actually is. It should be reported alongside the average (unless the user will be confused).</p><p>

\[
s = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N-1} \sum_{i=1}^N(x_i - \bar{x})^2}
\]

</p><p>Where:</p>
<ul>
    <li>\(N\) is the number of observations</li>
    <li>\(x_i\) is the value of the \(i\)<sup>th</sup> observation</li>
    <li>\(\bar{x}\) is the average value of \(x_i\)</li>
</ul>

<p>Reference: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation">Standard deviation (Wikipedia)</a></p>

<h3>1.2 Standard Error of the Mean</h3>

<p>From a statistical point of view, the "average" is really just an <em>estimate</em> of an underlying population mean. That estimate has uncertainty that is summarized by the standard error.</p><p>

\[
SE = \frac{s}{\sqrt{N}}
\]

</p><p>Reference: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_error">Standard error (Wikipedia)</a></p>

<h3>1.3 Confidence Interval Around the Mean</h3>

<p>A confidence interval reflects the set of statistical hypotheses that won’t be rejected at a given significance level. So the confidence interval around the mean reflects all possible values of the mean that can’t be rejected by the data. It is a multiple of the standard error added to and subtracted from the mean.</p><p>

\[
CI = \bar{x} \pm t_{\alpha/2} SE
\]

</p><p>Where:</p>
<ul>
    <li>\(\alpha\) is the significance level, typically 5% (one minus the confidence level)</li>
    <li>\(t_{\alpha/2}\) is the \(1-\alpha/2\) quantile of a t-distribution with \(N-1\) degrees of freedom</li>
</ul>

<p>Reference: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval#Theoretical_example">Confidence interval (Wikipedia)</a></p>

<h3>1.4 Two-Sample T-Test</h3>

<p>A two-sample t-test can tell whether two groups of observations differ in their mean.</p>

<p>The test statistic is given by:</p><p>

\[
t = \frac{\bar{x_1} - \bar{x_2}}{\sqrt{s^2_1/n_1 + s^2_2/n_2}}
\]

</p><p>The hypothesis of equal means is rejected if \(|t|\) exceeds the \((1-\alpha/2)\) quantile of a t distribution with degrees of freedom equal to:</p><p>

\[

<h2>2. Formulas For Reporting Proportions</h2>

<p>It’s common to report the relative proportions of binary outcomes or categorical data, but in general these are meaningless without confidence intervals and tests of independence.</p>

<h3>2.1 Confidence Interval of a Bernoulli Parameter</h3>

<p>A Bernoulli parameter is the proportion underlying a binary-outcome event (for example, the percent of the time a coin comes up heads). The confidence interval is given by:</p><p>

\[
CI = \left(p + \frac{z^2_{\alpha/2}}{2N} \pm z_{\alpha/2} \sqrt{[p(1-p) + z^2_{\alpha/2}/4N]/N}\right)/(1+z^2_{\alpha/2}/N)
\]

</p><p>Where:</p>
<ul>
    <li>\(p\) is the observed proportion of interest</li>
    <li>\(z_{\alpha/2}\) is the \((1-\alpha/2)\) quantile of a normal distribution</li>
</ul>

<p>This formula can also be used as a <a href="https://www.evanmiller.org/how-not-to-sort-by-average-rating.html">sorting criterion</a>.</p>

<p>Reference: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_proportion_confidence_interval#Wilson_score_interval">Binomial proportion confidence interval (Wikipedia)</a></p>

<h3>2.2 Multinomial Confidence Intervals</h3>

<p>If you have more than two categories, a multinomial confidence interval supplies upper and lower confidence limits on all of the category proportions at once. The formula is nearly identical to the preceding one.</p><p>

\[
CI = \left(p_j + \frac{z^2_{\alpha/2}}{2N} \pm z_{\alpha/2} \sqrt{[p_j(1-p_j) + z^2_{\alpha/2}/4N]/N}\right)/(1+z^2_{\alpha/2}/N)
\]
</p><p>Where:</p>
<ul>
    <li>\(p_j\) is the observed proportion of the \(j\)th category</li>
</ul>

<p>Reference: <a href="http://www.math.wsu.edu/faculty/genz/papers/mvnsing/node8.html">Confidence Intervals for Multinomial Proportions</a></p>

<h3>2.3 Chi-Squared Test</h3>

<p>Pearson’s chi-squared test can detect whether the distribution of row counts seem to differ across columns (or vice versa). It is useful when comparing two or more sets of category proportions.</p>

<p>The test statistic, called \(X^2\), is computed as:</p><p>

\[
X^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{j=1}^m \frac{(O_{i,j} - E_{i,j})^2}{E_{i,j}}
\]

</p><p>Where:</p>
<ul>
    <li>\(n\) is the number of rows</li>
    <li>\(m\) is the number of columns</li>
    <li>\(O_{i,j}\) is the observed count in row \(i\) and column \(j\)</li>
    <li>\(E_{i,j}\) is the expected count in row \(i\) and column \(j\)</li>
</ul>

<p>The expected count is given by:</p><p>

\[
E_{i,j} = \frac{\sum_{k=1}^nO_{k,j} \sum_{l=1}^mO_{i,l} }{N}
\]
</p><p>Where:</p>
<ul>
    <li>\(N\) is the sum of all the cells, i.e., the total number of observations</li>
</ul>

<p>A statistical dependence exists if \(X^2\) is greater than the (\(1-\alpha\)) quantile of a \(\chi^2\) distribution with \((m-1)\times(n-1)\) degrees of freedom.</p>

<h2>3. Formulas For Reporting Count Data</h2>

<p>If the incoming events are independent, their counts are well-described by a Poisson distribution. A Poisson distribution takes a parameter \(\lambda\), which is the distribution’s mean — that is, the average arrival rate of events per unit time.</p>

<h3>3.1. Standard Deviation of a Poisson Distribution</h3>

<p>The standard deviation of Poisson data usually doesn’t need to be explicitly calculated. Instead it can be inferred from the Poisson parameter:</p><p>

\[
\sigma = \sqrt{\lambda}
\]

</p><p>This fact can be used to read an <a href="https://www.evanmiller.org/how-to-read-an-unlabeled-sales-chart.html">unlabeled sales chart</a>, for example.</p>

<p>Reference: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution">Poisson distribution (Wikipedia)</a></p>

<h3>3.2. Confidence Interval Around the Poisson Parameter</h3>

<p>The confidence interval around the Poisson parameter represents the set of arrival rates that can’t be rejected by the data. It can be inferred from a single data point of \(c\) events observed over \(t\) time periods with the following formula:</p><p>

\[
CI = \left(\frac{\gamma^{-1}(\alpha/2, c)}{t}, \frac{\gamma^{-1}(1-\alpha/2, c+1)}{t}\right)
\]

</p><p>Where:</p>
<ul>
    <li>\(\gamma^{-1}(p, c)\) is the inverse of the lower incomplete gamma function</li>
</ul>

<p>Reference: <a href="http://www.math.mcmaster.ca/peter/s743/poissonalpha.html">Confidence Intervals for the Mean of a Poisson Distribution</a></p>

<h3>3.3. Conditional Test of Two Poisson Parameters</h3>

<p>Please never do this:</p>

<center>
    <img src="https://www.evanmiller.org/images/formulas/count-change.png">
</center>

<p>From a statistical point of view, 5 events is indistinguishable from 7 events. Before reporting in bright red text that one count is greater than another, it’s best to perform a test of the two Poisson means.</p>

<p>The p-value is given by:</p><p>

\[
p = 2\times\frac{c!}{t^c}\times\min\left\{ 
\sum_{i=0}^{c_1} \frac{t_1^i t_2^{c-i}}{i!(c-i)!},
\sum_{i=c_1}^{c} \frac{t_1^i t_2^{c-i}}{i!(c-i)!}
\right\}
\]

</p><p>Where:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Observation 1 consists of \(c_1\) events over \(t_1\) time periods</li>
    <li>Observation 2 consists of \(c_2\) events over \(t_2\) time periods</li>
    <li>\(c = c_1 + c_2\) and \(t = t_1 + t_2\)</li>
</ul>

<p>You can see a demonstration of these concepts in <a href="https://www.evanmiller.org/ab-testing/poisson-means.html">Evan’s Awesome Poisson Means Test</a>.</p>

<h2>4. Formulas For Comparing Distributions</h2>

<p>If you want to test whether groups of observations come from the same (unknown) distribution, or if a single group of observations comes from a known distribution, you’ll need a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. A K-S test will test the entire distribution for equality, not just the distribution mean.</p>

<h3>4.1. Comparing An Empirical Distribution to a Known Distribution</h3>

<p>The simplest version is a one-sample K-S test, which compares a sample of \(n\) points having an observed cumulative distribution function \(F\) to a known distribution function having a c.d.f. of \(G\). The test statistic is:</p><p>

\[
D_n = \sup_x|F(x) - G(x)|
\]

</p><p>In plain English, \(D_n\) is the absolute value of the largest difference in the two c.d.f.s for any value of \(x\).</p>

<p>The critical value of \(D_n\) at significance level \(\alpha\) is given by \(K_\alpha/\sqrt{n}\), where \(K_\alpha\) is the value of \(x\) that solves:</p><p>

\[
1 - \alpha = \frac{\sqrt{2\pi}}{x}\sum_{k=1}^\infty \exp{\left(-(2k-1)^2\pi^2/(8x^2)\right)}
\]

</p><p>The critical must be solved iteratively, e.g. by Newton’s method. If only the p-value is needed, it can be computed directly by solving the above for \(\alpha\).</p>

<p>Reference: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov%E2%80%93Smirnov_test">Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test (Wikipedia)</a></p>

<h3>4.2. Comparing Two Empirical Distributions</h3>

<p>The two-sample version is similar, except the test statistic is given by:</p><p>

\[
D_{n_1,n_2} = \sup_x|F_1(x) - F_2(x)|
\]

</p><p>Where \(F_1\) and \(F_2\) are the empirical c.d.f.s of the two samples, having \(n_1\) and \(n_2\) observations, respectively. The critical value of the test statistic is \(K_\alpha/\sqrt{n_1 n_2/(n_1 + n_2)}\) with the same value of \(K_\alpha\) above.</p>

<p>Reference: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov%E2%80%93Smirnov_test#Two-sample_Kolmogorov.E2.80.93Smirnov_test">Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test (Wikipedia)</a></p>

<h3>4.3. Comparing Three or More Empirical Distributions</h3>

<p>A \(k\)-sample extension of Kolmogorov-Smirnov was described by J. Kiefer in a <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/2237091">1959 paper</a>. The test statistic is:</p><p>

\[
T = \sup_x \sum_{j=1}^k n_j |F_j(x) - \bar{F}(x)|
\] 

</p><p>Where \(\bar{F}\) is the c.d.f. of the combined samples. The critical value of \(T\) is \(a^2\) where \(a\) solves:</p><p>

\[
1 - \alpha = \frac{4}{\Gamma\left(\frac{h}{2}\right)2^{h/2}a^h} 
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(\gamma_{(h-2)/2,n})^{h-2}\exp[-(\gamma_{(h-2)/2,n})^2/2a^2]}{[J_{h/2}(\gamma_{(h-2)/2,n})]^2}
\]

</p><p>Where:</p>
<ul>
    <li>\(h=k-1\)</li>
    <li>\(J_{h/2}\) is a Bessel function of the first kind with order \(h/2\)</li>
    <li>\(\gamma_{(h-2)/2,n}\) is the \(n\)<sup>th</sup> zero of \(J_{(h-2)/2}\)
</li></ul>

<p>To compute the critical value, this equation must also be solved iteratively. When \(k=2\), the equation reduces to a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The case of \(k=4\) can also be reduced to a simpler form, but for other values of \(k\), the equation cannot be reduced.</p>

<p>Reference: <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/2237091">K-sample analogues of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Cramer-v. Mises tests (JSTOR)</a></p>

<h2>5. Formulas For Drawing a Trend Line</h2>

<p>Trend lines (or best-fit lines) can be used to establish a relationship between two variables and predict future values.</p>

<h3>5.1. Slope of a Best-Fit Line</h3>

<p>The slope of a best-fit (least squares) line is:</p><p>

\[
m = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sum_{i=1}^N(x_i - \bar{x})^2}
\]

</p><p>Where:</p>
<ul>
    <li>\(\{x_1, \ldots, x_N\}\) is the independent variable with sample mean \(\bar{x}\)</li>
    <li>\(\{y_1, \ldots, y_N\}\) is the dependent variable with sample mean \(\bar{y}\)</li>
</ul>

<h3>5.2. Standard Error of the Slope</h3>

<p>The standard error around the estimated slope is:</p><p>

\[
SE = \frac{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^N(y_i - \bar{y} - m (x_i - \bar{x}))^2/(N-2)}}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^N(x_i - \bar{x})^2}}
\]

<a name="trend_ci"></a></p><h3>5.3. Confidence Interval Around the Slope</h3>

<p>The confidence interval is constructed as:</p><p>

\[
CI = m \pm t_{\alpha/2} SE
\]
</p><p>Where:</p>
<ul>
    <li>\(\alpha\) is the significance level, typically 5% (one minus the confidence level)</li>
    <li>\(t_{\alpha/2}\) is the \(1-\alpha/2\) quantile of a t-distribution with \(N-2\) degrees of freedom</li>
</ul>

OpenAI said the administration should consider providing some relief for AI companies big and small from state rules – if and when enacted – in exchange for voluntary access to models.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The recommendation was one of several included in OpenAI’s response to a request for public input issued by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy in February as the administration drafts a new policy to ensure US dominance in AI. President Donald Trump previously rescinded the Biden administration’s sprawling executive order on AI and tasked the science office with developing an AI Action Plan by July.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->To date, there has been a notable absence of federal legislation governing the AI sector.

			"For it is true that astronomy, from a popular standpoint, is handicapped by the inability of the average workman to 
			own an expensive astronomical telescope. It is also true that if an amateur starts out to build a telescope just for 
			fun he will find, before his labors are over, that he has become seriously interested in the wonderful mechanism of 
			our universe. And finally there is understandably the stimulus of being able to unlock the mysteries of the 
			heavens by a tool fashioned by one's own hand."</p>

			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<p>A lot has changed since Russell Porter wrote those 
			words - today the "average workman" can afford to buy an already 
			made telescope and Dobsonian mountings are very popular.&nbsp; Much 
			is also unchanged - mirror grinding techniques are very similar to 
			those written up by Porter and Ingalls in the 20´s and 30´s. Many 
			amateur astronomers still choose to fabricate their own instruments, 
			for the pride of accomplishment, the gaining of knowledge and the 
			insurance of quality. Telescope making is at the heart of the 
			Springfield Telescope Makers - after all it is two thirds of our 
			club's name - and on these pages we hope to show you that you too 
			can make your own telescope - and it can be an excellent performer!</p>

			<p><b>A note on ATM techniques:</b> There are almost as many ways to 
			make mirrors and telescopes as there are telescope makers. On these 
			pages we present one or more ways that have worked for us, but that 
			doesn't mean there aren't many other valid approaches. In fact, many 
			of us enjoy ATMing because we can experiment with different 
			techniques and sometimes find better ways of making or building a 
			telescope. And even if our new technique isn't better, we usually 
			learn something valuable in the process. On these pages, however, we 
			have tried to stick with simple and proven techniques that are most 
			appropriate for novice mirror and telescope makers, and are 
			generally what we teach beginners at the <a href="https://stellafane.org/tm/mc/index.html">
			Stellafane Mirror Class</a>.</p>

</p><div><a href="https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex020/uploads/cursor1/original/3X/a/b/ab177027c0693000ad59262e3086284b6d75b2f9.png" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/opxRwKvjSkAPNtkr1zZ4MnWpcIF.png?dl=1" title="image" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><img src="https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex020/uploads/cursor1/original/3X/a/b/ab177027c0693000ad59262e3086284b6d75b2f9.png" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="opxRwKvjSkAPNtkr1zZ4MnWpcIF" width="545" height="339"></a></div>
<p>Not sure if LLMs know what they are for (lol), but doesn’t matter as a much as a fact that I can’t go through 800 locs. Anyone had similar issue? It’s really limiting at this point and I got here after just 1h of vibe coding</p>
<p>My operating system is MacOS Sequoia 15.3.1</p>

              <p>Lol yes the message is actually funny. Not sure why it would write that in reality, never saw it happen.</p>
<p>So, in general its a bad idea to have huge files with code.<br>
Not just because of AI context limit but also for humans to handle them.<br>
Too big files are often a sign that a project is not well structured and the concerns of each file/class/function etc are not separate from each other.</p>
<p>It also seems you are not using the Chat window with the integrated ‘Agent’ which would create that file for you easier than in the ‘editor’ part of Cursor.</p>

              <p>So as you are starting with Cursor i highly recommend going through the Docu to learn what it can do… and how to use each part</p>


<p>Yes it would help to ask it to split parts, depends on what language you use (looks like JS?), AI can then use import statements to include those separate files into your ‘start file’.</p>
<p>Usually its a good idea to do modular programming (split functionality into modules or classes or functions, depending on language or framework).<br>
If you tell AI to use for example Single Responsibility Principle as guideline when coding it will not mix different features in one file. You may also create rules (see docs) that tell the AI for example to keep files under 500 lines limit (a bit over is not tragic but the more lines the harder it will be for AI)…</p>

Thanks for your advice the other day, my post got deleted for an unknown reason, but I decided to go ahead and purchase a one month cursor pro subscription as you advised, I didn’t experience any major problems with the new releases and I’m enjoying it.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p><img src="https://nanochess.org/img/transputer_12.png" width="50%" alt="Ray traced robot made in transputer using my C compiler"></p><p>
    In <a href="https://nanochess.org/bootstrapping_c_os_transputer.html">my previous article</a> I talked about how I managed to create a self-contained operating system for transputer. This included the basic operating system, a text editor, a Small-C compiler, and an assembler.
</p>
<p>
    The year was 1995, I was age 16, Lemon Tree and Zombie were being played in the radio, ARPANET closed around 1990, and it started to be known as Internet, and in Mexico only a handful of people used it through Compuserve Mexico. I wasn't so lucky to have this service.
</p>
<p>
    I was evolving my operating system, modifying it and improving it, recompiling and rebooting. I was pretty interested in compiling any C language source code I could get my hands on, and I got hold of several CD-ROM discs, but I couldn't compile most things because I had a Small-C compiler, not a full C compiler.
</p>
<p>
    This prompted me to extend my C language compiler to support more C features. Because youth is bold, I kept doing comparisons with text pieces from the input just like Small C did. I was working in a platform with only 128 KB. of RAM, and I could manage that feat because the transputer instruction set generated very small executables. But of course, a proper lexer would have made faster compilations.
</p>
<p>
    As I progressed in my implementation of the C language features, following the K&amp;R book's appendix A, I discovered that developing most of these was pretty direct, like <i>struct</i>, and <i>union</i>. <i>Typedef</i> was the most complicated to understand. The pointer arithmetic syntax precedence was very difficult, in particular for getting an array of function pointers. I'm still proud of how I made byte-code descriptions of C types, the only difficult thing was getting right the recursive calls to handle precedence. Also getting initializers to work was hard to do as these had very loose syntax in real compilers.
</p>
<p>
    The C compiler took me a lot more time than the Pascal compiler, and from my revision notes I used almost a full year to get an almost full K&amp;R C compiler (K&amp;R means Kernighan &amp; Ritchie, or a compiler as described in their original book). My information was outdated, because I had the 1978 book, but the book was updated in 1988, and ANSI C was approved in 1989.
</p>
<p>
    I tuned the preprocessor with each new source code I found for testing. I was amazingly happy when my compiler finally managed to run a chess program by Vern Paxson from an obscure contest ran in USENET, the <a href="http://www.ioccc.org/">IOCCC</a> (International Obfuscated C Code Contest). I found this program in the book <i>Expert C Programming</i> by Peter Van Der Linden (1994).
</p>
<p>
    Once the C compiler was supporting floating point, I was able to port back the Ray Tracer I made in <a href="https://nanochess.org/pascal.html">Pascal</a>, and I developed a 3D poligonal model program following the course and exercises in the book <i>3D Computer Graphics</i> by Alan Watt (1993).
</p>
<p>
    The last additions to the host Z280 computer were a SCSI card, and all the peripherals were basically recycled from tech trash, for example, a SCSI hard disk drive (powerful 40 MB when the common ones were 500 MB), a SCSI DAT tape drive, and a SCSI CD-ROM reader (at least this was new!).</p>
<p><img src="https://nanochess.org/img/transputer_14.jpg" width="50%" alt="Compact Disc The Cranberries: Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We?"></p><p>
    I added to my transputer operating system a way to read High-Sierra and ISO-9660 format structures to access CD-ROM data, and a program to unzip files from these discs. I was pretty proud of how I managed to compile the source code of a public domain version of Inflate for ZIP files. Another thing is that these CD-ROM drives could play audio CD automatically, you just put a CD (mine was Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We?) and hear music while working.
</p>
<p>
    The tape drive was DAT format, and I made some backups using my TAR program. I have forgotten completely where are these tape stored, now that's the most secure backup storage! The one no one can find.
</p>
<p>
    I reached the high-point of my development for transputer around the summer of 1996, but the processor started to show its age. 128K RAM of memory was barely enough for working. As I bloated my programs with more features, the transputer started to look more and more slow. And unfortunately, another board was never made. I would have been very interested in handling multiprocessing.
</p>
<h2>Restoring the operating system</h2>
<p>
    The work for restoring my operating system wasn't so easy as I thought. I had to expand the <i>buildboot.c</i> program to create floppy disk images in the latest file system format, and also hard disk images. Later as I put together the image file, I needed support for growing disk directories.
</p>
<p>
    The main difference is the expansion of directory entries to 64 bytes. This was a by-product of discovering that I was free to specify my operating system as I liked, so the first thing for me was "the great escape" from the 8.3 filename format common in MS-DOS at the time (Windows 95 was barely released a few months ago). It wasn't done in a single step, my first expansion of the file system was fifteen letter names using the 32 bytes directory entries (Jan/01/1996), and the next expansion was thirty-one letter names using 64 byte entries (Feb/06/1996).

</p>
<p>
    Once the disk image builder was ready, I put the <i>SOM.32.bin</i> file along <i>Interfaz.p</i> inside the floppy image, and tried to boot it up after adding the required services in the transputer emulator (including three drive units: floppy disk, RAM disk, and hard drive). It got stuck after reading the boot sector, and the cause was the byte order for the sector number was big-endian. After doing the change in the emulator, it was able to read the whole file inside the memory and it got stuck.
</p>
<p>
    Apparently the timers didn't work as the screen wasn't updated, so I added timer handling for low-priority threads, and the screen become visible. Still, it got stuck. I made a brief modification to the interface code with the host (a semaphor), but it still didn't operate. The only reason for this is that the <i>MAESTRO.CMG</i> file used a different protocol to interface with the operating system. I searched in my files until I found the correct file and source code, I used this file to boot up the operating system and it worked on the first try, and it advanced enough to complain of a missing <i>C:/Interfaz.p</i>
</p>
<p>
    I had forgotten how my operating system booted up! 
</p>

Notice it is double density (720 kb).
</p>
<h2>The minimum required files</h2>
<p>
    It turns out that the floppy disk was used to boot the operating system (the file <i>SOM.32.bin</i>), and in turn it would access a hard disk through drive C: to load the command-line processor.
</p>
<p>
    Once this file was loaded, I needed a few more files to be able to compile programs inside the operating system: <i>editor.p</i>, <i>cc.p</i>, <i>ens.p</i>, and <i>ejecutable.p</i>.
</p>
<p>
    I started by testing my text editor, and it was pretty pleased watching how it colorized the preprocessor directives and the C language elements. All the source code is written with Spanish comments, and it is just too much code to translate it to English.
</p>

</p>
<p>
    I never implemented a current directory feature, so you need to type the full path for each file. A feature of my operating system is that the A: drive is assumed, so you need to write <i>c:cc</i> to execute the C compiler from the hard disk drive. Also this is why all the paths have short names like C (for my source code) and lib (for the libraries). And of course, you need to type the path for each DIR command.
</p>
<p>
    However, I was mystified when I tried to run the C compiler. After typing <i>cc</i>, nothing appeared, it kept saying "Archivo inexistente" (file doesn't exist) I was pretty sure it worked the last time. Well, almost 30 years ago.
</p>
<p>
    I tried the MEM command, and it said 99240 bytes free. And running the <i>Info.p</i> utility with the C compiler executable gave me the answer: program size = 38112 bytes, stack size = 8192 bytes, global data = 56816 bytes, after adding all this it required 103120 bytes. I was baffled! For sure I compiled some programs without any extra memory.
</p>
<p>
    It took me a full hour to remember the transputer processor has 4 kilobytes of internal memory, and if you map the 128K RAM in a classical mirrored way, the processor never uses the bus when accessing the lowest memory area $80000000 - $80000fff, but it uses the bus for any address outside like $80020000 - $80020fff, and this mirrors in the lower 4K of the external RAM. So a simple enhancement to get extra 4K was expanding the workspace to start at $80021000 (it moves toward lower addresses).
</p>
<p>
    I modified the boot up code, and the C compiler was up and running!
</p>
<h2>How to assemble your own files</h2>
<p>
    Given the different size instructions in the transputer, it was too difficult to write a linker. So instead I resorted to a mixed approach, my assembler allowed to process concatenated transputer assembler files, and in turn generate a preliminary executable. This file should be processed by <i>ejecutable.p</i> and this way the user enters the stack size, and the program adds a header information to indicate how much stack space it would use.
</p>
<table>
    <tbody><tr><th colspan="2">Executable header</th></tr>
    <tr><th>Offset</th><th>Field</th></tr>
    <tr><td>+0</td><td>OTBE (0x4542544f) Oscar Toledo Binario Ejecutable</td></tr>
    <tr><td>+4</td><td>0x08031996 (Mar/08/1996)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>+8</td><td>Code size</td></tr>
    <tr><td>+12</td><td>Extra data size</td></tr>
    <tr><td>+16</td><td>Stack size</td></tr>
    <tr><td>+20</td><td>Data size</td></tr>
    <tr><td>+24</td><td>Unused</td></tr>
    <tr><td>...</td><td>...</td></tr>
    <tr><td>+60</td><td>Unused</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>
    I never implemented proper command-line processing in my operating system, so every program had to start with an entry sequence to provide the options and filenames. This in turn made harder to implement batch command files, because all the programs required user input.
</p>
<p>
    I started to compile each program in the source tree I had, and when I executed the raytracing program and the 3D modeler program, I couldn't get any image in the output.
</p>
<p>
    I also had forgotten how to link my own programs! Turns out I made a document with a description of how to rebuild each program, sitting nicely as <i>Documentos/Programas.doc</i> and the <i>Mat.len</i> library was meant to be put at the start of the assembler program, so it could load properly its constants. Without the startup code every mathematical function returned zero.
</p>
<p>
    By the way, I rediscovered why I made a small 512 KB RAM disk in the B drive. First, it was the memory available in the host Z280 system, second, it helped me to assemble faster the programs as it didn't have to access the SCSI hard drive.
</p>
<p>
    So I only had to compile the C language program (read from the hard disk drive) to the RAM disk, and assemble over the RAM disk. Finally, the completed executable could be written back to the hard disk. This was way faster than any assembling I had done before over floppy disk, and it was pretty much required as my programs had grown.
</p>
<h2>Floating-point errors</h2>
<p>
    Now I got an image in the 3D modeler but it had obvious mathematical miscalculations. I could revise routine by routine, and try to get an idea of what was wrong, or I could go over the small bunch of floating-point instructions and check for correct emulation. I was lucky to find almost immediately that <i>fpldnldbi</i> only removed items in a strange way from the processor stack, and that <i>fpldnlsni</i> had a doubled index (probably I cut and pasted the code from <i>fpldnldbi</i>). And the Utah teapot got displayed in all its 3D glory for the first time since 1996. Good memories!

</p>
<p>I got the Utah teapot vertex data from the Appendix D of the book "3D Computer Graphics" which included a course on 3D computer graphics, and the project for the reader (student) was writing a 3D modeler based on the calculations presented by the book. It learned a lot with this book, and I was able to code the modeler in a few weeks.
</p>
<p>
    Interestingly, I thought the ray tracer worked, but it had a very particular failure while handling cylinders, creating random black pixels on the image. Along the path I corrected the cloudy sky function, it passed col[2] instead of col2 causing a crash because it wrote on random memory addresses.
</p>
<p>
    I reminded this was a known bug, I never could make the cylinder code to work at the time. For some reason, I couldn't find the bug. Now with a full emulation, I was able to pinpoint the bug to the quadratic intersection function:
</p>

<p>
    It did a floating-point load and multiply in single precision, and then immediately saves the value as double precision. So the bug wasn't in the ported code, but in my C compiler. 
</p>
<p>
    It happens my C compiler tries to optimize code using 32-bit floating point if all values are 32-bit, but if the operation is too complex, it saves the current value in the workspace as a temporary. There is just a small problem: It always saves the temporary as a 64-bit floating point value.
</p>
<p>
    The change was "relatively" easy. The original code in my compiler <i>ccexpr.c</i> file reads as:
</p>
<pre><small>
      if(haz_compatible(&amp;izq, info, &amp;der, info2)) {
        crea_nodo(N_MULPF, izq, der, 0);
      } else {
</small></pre>
<p>
    The function <i>haz_compatible()</i> makes compatibles the types for the left and right nodes of the expression tree, and returns a non-zero value for floating-point operations. The transputer assumes we are passing the right values to the instruction, so we can use the <i>fpmul</i> instruction for both <i>float</i> and <i>double</i>.
</p>
<p>
    However, we need to add information for the exception of both being <i>float</i> type, for the purposes of saving the temporary value if the expression tree is too complex:
</p>
<pre><small>
      if(haz_compatible(&amp;izq, info, &amp;der, info2)) {
        crea_nodo(N_MULPF, izq, der, *((char *) info[0]) == FLOAT);
      } else {
</small></pre>
<p>
    This way the <i>esp[]</i> array (written by <i>crea_nodo</i>) will contain one if the operands are <i>float</i> instead of <i>double</i>. As the code evolved from a C compiler that didn't support <i>struct</i>, the pointers are saved as integers in arrays (yes, very unportable!)
</p>
<p>
Now we should modify the code for saving temporary values in <i>ccgencod.c</i>. This is the original code in the function <i>gen_nodo()</i>:
</p>
<pre><small>
      } else {
        gen_nodo(nodo_der[nodo]);
        salva(1);
        gen_nodo(nodo_izq[nodo]);
        if(op == N_SUMAPF) {
          recupera(2);
          return;
        } else if(op == N_MULPF) {
          recupera(3);
          return;
        }
        recupera(1);
      }

/*

salva(flotante)
  int flotante;
{
  if(flotante) {
    emite_texto("ajw -2\r\nldlp 0\r\nfpstnldb\r\n");
    pila -= 2;
  } else {
    emite_texto("ajw -1\r\nstl 0\r\n");
    --pila;
  }
}

/*

recupera(flotante)

  if(flotante) {
    emite_linea("ldlp 0");
    if(flotante == 1)
      emite_linea("fpldnldb");
    else if(flotante == 2)
      emite_linea("fpldnladddb");
    else if(flotante == 3)
      emite_linea("fpldnlmuldb");
    emite_linea("ajw 2");
    pila += 2;
  } else {
    emite_texto("ldl 0\r\najw 1\r\n");
    ++pila;
  }
}
</small></pre>
<p>
    It saves the temporary value using the function <i>salva()</i>, and restores it using <i>recupera()</i>. We add the information for <i>float</i> values:
</p>
<pre><small>
          } else {
        gen_nodo(nodo_der[nodo]);
        salva(esp[nodo] ? 2 : 1);
        gen_nodo(nodo_izq[nodo]);

    It only remained compiling again the C compiler, and the ray tracer program. After the correction it could render the test cylinder correctly, and finally I could see correctly the ray traced robot I made in 1996. It only took me 29 years to correct the bug! Now it looks so simple, but at the time I couldn't find it.

<h2>Installing it (just like new!)</h2>
<p>Make sure your Terminal is setup as 80x25 characters, and using ISO Latin 1 (ISO-8859-1) as character set. Did I told you I discovered I could innovate? I used the $80-$9f characters (not used by ISO-8859-1) to put box graphics like in PC as I could define whatever I want in the VGA graphics card, but currently these will appear as blank in the terminal. Maybe I could make a converter to UTF-8.</p>
<p>The <i>os_final</i> directory was added to the git, and inside the <i>tree</i> directory contains the backup of my operating system. There is already a prebuilt image of the floppy disk, and the hard disk, so you only need to run the emulator with the proper arguments. However, for the sake of completeness, here is the sequence of steps to rebuild the drive image files.</p>
<p>The following command lines are provided into the <i>build_f1.sh</i>, <i>build_f2.sh</i>, and <i>build_hd.sh</i> shell files.</p>
<p>
    With the command line at the <i>os_final</i> directory, the 40 mb. hard disk drive image file is created using the <i>buildboot</i> utility, it includes only the file <i>Interfaz.p</i> (the command-line processor):
</p>
<pre><small>
    ../transputer/os/buildboot -hd -v2 harddisk.img . tree/Interfaz.p
</small></pre>
<p>
    Now the first floppy disk image is created with the basic files required:
</p>
<pre><small>
    ../transputer/os/buildboot -fd -v2 floppy.img . tree/SOM.32.bin tree/Interfaz.p tree/Editor.p tree/CC.p tree/Ens.p tree/Ejecutable.p tree/Info.p tree/Halt.p tree/C/CC.c tree/C/CCanasin.c tree/C/CCexpr.c tree/C/CCgencod.c tree/C/CCinter.c tree/C/CCvarios.c tree/C/CCvars.c tree/C/Checar.c tree/C/Compara.c tree/C/Concat.c tree/C/Conjunto.c tree/C/Copiador.c tree/C/CPC.c tree/C/DARC.c tree/C/Divide.c tree/C/DZIP.c tree/C/Editor.c tree/C/Efem.c tree/C/Ejecutable.c tree/C/Ens.c tree/C/Explode.c tree/C/Filtro.c tree/C/GZIP.C tree/C/Hora.c tree/C/Inflate.c tree/C/Info.c tree/C/Interfaz.c tree/C/Libro.c tree/C/Monitor.c tree/C/Prepara.c tree/C/Semana_santa.c tree/C/Som32.c tree/C/TAR.c tree/C/Unreduce.c tree/C/Unshrink.c tree/C/Vaciado.c tree/C/Halt.c tree/lib/E.len tree/lib/Graf.len tree/lib/MAT.len tree/lib/Mensajes.len tree/lib/Stdio.len
</small></pre>
<p>
    Now the operating system should be run using my transputer emulator (a further argument with an ISO image can be added to get a CD-ROM in drive D):
</p>
<pre><small>
    ../transputer/tem -os2 maestro.cmg floppy.img harddisk.img
</small></pre>
<p>Now the files can be copied to the hard disk drive using this command line (CD creates a directory, and COPIA copies files):</p>
<pre><small>
    CD C:/C
    CD C:/Lib
    COPIA *.P C:
    COPIA *.C C:/C
    COPIA *.LEN C:/C
    DIR C:
    HALT
</small></pre>
<p>
    The second floppy disk image is now created:
</p>
<pre><small>
    ../transputer/os/buildboot -fd -v2 floppy.img . tree/SOM.32.bin tree/Halt.p tree/Desarrollo/Ajedrez.c tree/Desarrollo/Reloj.c tree/Desarrollo/Tetris.c tree/C/Modelado.c tree/C/M3D.c tree/Dibujo_3D/* tree/Documentos/Archivo.doc tree/Documentos/Detalles.doc tree/Documentos/Ens.doc tree/Documentos/Peticiones.doc tree/Documentos/Programas.doc tree/Documentos/Servicios.doc tree/Documentos/Trabajo.doc tree/Documentos/Transputer.doc
</small></pre>
<p>Now the files can be copied to the hard disk drive using this command line (CD creates a directory, and COPIA copies files):</p>
<pre><small>
    CD C:/Desarrollo
    COPIA Ajedrez.c C:/Desarrollo
    COPIA Reloj.c C:/Desarrollo
    COPIA Tetris.c C:/Desarrollo
    COPIA Modelado.c C:/C
    COPIA M3D.c C:/C
    CD C:/Documentos
    COPIA *.doc c:/Documentos
    HALT
</small></pre>
<p>
    You can now reset the floppy disk image (just make sure it contains the SOM.32.bin file), or delete manually the files using the BORRA command (delete). The whole operating system (including source code) fits in under 3 megabytes.
</p>
<h2>Using the operating system</h2>
<p>
    You can see a list of the available commands typing AYUDA (if you read my previous article, this is way more complex than the few commands of my early operating system).
</p>
<ul>
    <li>AYUDA, shows a list of the available commands.</li>
    <li>DIR [path] -A -P, displays the directory for the path, the -A option shows names in two columns, and the -P option show the directory in pages.</li>
    <li>COPIA [wildcard] [path], copies files from the source to the target path.</li>
    <li>REN path new_name, renames a file to the new name.</li>
    <li>ILUSTRA path, displays the content of a file.</li>
    <li>BORRA wildcard, deletes a file. It can use wildcards.</li>
    <li>VER, shows the command-line processor version.</li>
    <li>MEM, displays the available memory bytes.</li>
    <li>LINEA text, displays the text in the screen (useful for batch commands)</li>
    <li>BLP, clears the screen.</li>
    <li>FIN, exits the command-line processor.</li>
    <li>BD path, deletes a directory.</li>
    <li>CD path, creates a directory.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    To run several commmands in sequence you can use the semicolon, for example:
</p>
<pre><small>
    C:EDITOR ; C:CC ; C:ENS
</small></pre>
<p>
    Or you can see an small example of multitasking typing this command to get a clock in the upper-right corner of the screen:
</p>
<pre><small>
    @C:/DESARROLLO/RELOJ
</small></pre>
<p>
    To exit the operating system use <i>C:HALT</i> as this will close correctly the drive image files.
</p>
<h2>Compiling programs</h2>
<p>
    To compile programs just type <i>C:CC</i> and press Enter. Type N for the first two questions, then type the path to the source code file, for example, <i>c:/C/Hora.c</i> and then the target assembler file, for example, <i>b:hora.len</i> 
</p>
<p>
    You should assemble the program, type <i>C:ENS</i> and press Enter. Type <i>b:hora.len</i> and press Enter, type <i>c:/lib/stdio.len</i> and press Enter, now press Enter alone, and type <i>b:hora.e</i> as output file.
</p>
<p>
    Now we need to convert it into an executable file, type <i>C:EJECUTABLE</i> and press Enter, type <i>b:hora.e</i> and press Enter, type <i>8192</i> and press Enter (stack size), type <i>0</i> (zero) and press Enter (extra data size), and type <i>C:hora.p</i> as output file.
</p>
<p>
    To run the program type <i>C:Hora</i> and press Enter.
</p></div><p>
    I was starting to get a grasp of how documentation was going to be fully electronic, so I wrote some incomplete descriptions of the operating system, file system, programs, and some further notes. All these files are available at the <i>Documentos</i> directory. It was a very different time.
</p><p>
    If you read my previous article, you can access the help window of the visual editor using Fn+F1 in macOS. You can read text files using Fn+F4 and navigate files with the arrow keys.
</p><p>
    There are three animations of the ray traced robot walking (I used these with the Pascal version of the Ray Tracer), however, I don't have tested these, and the process utility to create a FLI animation was written in Z280 machine code.
</p><p>
    I like how this operating system shows original thinking for solving problems, like working with only 128 kb. of RAM, having 31 letter filenames, using full pathnames for referring to files, adapting the free space of the character set for graphical characters, managing a RAM disk to accelerate development, and of course getting to develop a K&amp;R C compiler over it.
</p><p>
    I could have made more things, however, the host computer was showing its slowness in particular with graphics, and I reached the limit of the RAM memory. This prevented me of expanding the C compiler to ANSI C, I could compile very few programs from external sources, the linker was never finished so I couldn't compile programs in modules (and in turn the C compiler didn't implement <i>extern</i> or <i>static</i>). I was stuck.
</p><p>
    My experiment with transputer was technically finished, although I did a few more programs thinking in the future (like a program to create CD-ROM file systems expecting a CD recorder I never had).
</p><p>
My first visit to an Internet coffee shop was around the summer of 1996, I discovered sadly the Inmos demise, and it was a total disappointment as their promised T9000 with a ten times speed fold never materialized.
</p><p>
Also a newer 32-bit processor was coming and my father was building a new computer where I built new software, and later I would make my windowed operating system, and all my tools from transputer would be ported to this bigger machine.
</p><p>
A by-product of my C compiler, was porting it back to the Z280 computer to compile an educative integrated Z80 development tool (editor/assembler/uploader) I made already using Mark DeSmet PCC for MS-DOS, I cheered myself when I compiled the same program for my Z280 computer without any changes. That was the last gasp of the Z280 computer.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="new-post-content"><p><em><span>Cybersecurity Researcher, Jeremiah Fowler, discovered and reported to </span><a href="https://www.websiteplanet.com/"><span>Website Planet</span></a><span> about a non-password-protected database that contained over 86,000 records belonging to</span> <b>ESHYFT</b><span> — a New-Jersey-based HealthTech company that operates in 29 states. It offers a mobile app platform that connects healthcare facilities with healthcare workers, including Certified Nursing Assistants (CNAs), Licensed Practical Nurses (LPNs), and Registered Nurses (RNs).</span></em></p>
<p><a href="https://dt2sdf0db8zob.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WSP-ESHYFT-healthtech-data-breach-key-elements-optimage1.png"><span><span><img data-src="https://dt2sdf0db8zob.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WSP-ESHYFT-healthtech-data-breach-key-elements-optimage1.png" width="780" height="582" alt="WSP-ESHYFT-healthtech-data-breach-key-elements" src="https://dt2sdf0db8zob.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WSP-ESHYFT-healthtech-data-breach-key-elements-optimage1.png"></span></span></a></p><p>
The publicly exposed database was not password-protected or encrypted. It contained 86,341 records totaling 108.8 GB in size. The majority of the documents were contained inside of a folder labeled “App”. In a limited sampling of the exposed documents, I saw records that included profile or facial images of users, .csv files with monthly work schedule logs, professional certificates, work assignment agreements, CVs and resumes that contained additional PII. One single spreadsheet document contained 800,000+ entries that detailed the nurse’s internal IDs, facility name, time and date of shifts, hours worked, and more.</p><p>
I also saw what appeared to be medical documents uploaded to the app. These files were potentially uploaded as proof for why individual nurses missed shifts or took sick leave. These medical documents included medical reports containing information of diagnosis, prescriptions, or treatments that could potentially fall under the ambit of HIPAA regulations.</p><p>
The name of the database as well as the documents inside it indicated that the records belonged to ESHYFT. I immediately sent a responsible disclosure notice to the company, and the database was restricted from public access over a month later. I received a response thanking me for the notification stating: “Thank you! we’re actively looking into this and working on a solution”. It is not known if the database was owned and managed by ESHYFT directly or via a third-party contractor. It is also not known how long the database was exposed before I discovered it or if anyone else gained access to it. Only an internal forensic audit could identify additional access or potentially suspicious activity.</p><p>
ESHYFT provides a mobile platform that connects healthcare facilities with qualified nursing professionals. It is available on both Apple’s App Store and the Google Play Store. Apple no longer provides user statistics, but the ESHYFT app has been downloaded more than 50,000 times from the Google Play Store.</p><p>
The application claims to offer nurses the flexibility to select shifts that fit their schedules while providing healthcare facilities with access to vetted W-2 nursing staff to meet their needs. The platform is available in following U.S. states: AL, AZ, AR, CA, CT, DE, FL, GA, IL, IN, IA, KS, KY, MD, MI, MN, MO, NE, NJ, OH, PA, RI, SC, TN, VT, VA, WA, WI, and WV.</p>

A <a href="https://bhw.hrsa.gov/data-research/projecting-health-workforce-supply-demand" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> by the Health Resources &amp; Services Administration (NCHWA) projects a 10% nationwide shortage of registered nurses by 2027. With the growing need for healthcare workers, platforms like ESHYFT serve an important role in filling those staffing deficiencies. This means that workers who perform offline jobs (like nursing) are now integrated with online technology, and <strong>healthtech companies need to implement robust privacy safeguards to bridge the gap securely.</strong></p><p>
As more hospitals and healthcare workers depend on technology for data storage, care management, and employment, the need for increased cybersecurity measures across the entire industry is inescapable. Hospitals are considered critical infrastructure and have been routinely targeted by cybercriminals. In recent years, numerous networks have been hit with devastating ransomware attacks. In my opinion, the data and PII of the doctors, nurses, and staff are equally as important as the healthcare facilities themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Any exposure of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), salary details, and work history of nursing professionals could result in significant potential risks and vulnerabilities</strong> — both for the affected individuals and the healthcare facilities that employ them. Scans of identification documents (such as driver’s licenses or Social Security cards) when combined with addresses and other contact details could hypothetically provide a gateway for cybercriminals to commit identity theft or financial fraud in the victims’ names.</p>
<p><strong>Another potential risk of exposed personal and professional details would be highly targeted phishing campaigns</strong> that could use real information to deceive victims with employment scams or drive them into revealing additional personal or financial data. I am not suggesting or implying that ESHYFT’s data or that of their users is at risk of any type of scam or fraudulent activity, or compromised in any manner. I am only providing a general observation of potential cybersecurity risks as it relates to the exposure of personally identifiable information. This commentary is intended solely to highlight the broader landscape of privacy and cybersecurity considerations.</p><p>
My recommendations for healthtech companies and medical software providers would be to take proactive cybersecurity measures to protect their data and prevent unauthorized access. This would include mandatory encryption protocols of sensitive data and regular security audits of internal infrastructure to identify potential vulnerabilities. <strong>It is always a good idea to limit the storage of sensitive data and anonymize records where possible.</strong> This includes assigning data an expiration date once it is no longer in use.</p><p>
In this particular case, it appears that user files were uploaded to a single folder and not segregated based on their sensitivity. As an example, a user’s profile image could have a low sensitivity rating while proof of a medical exam could have a high sensitivity rating. In theory, these two documents should not be stored in the same folder. <strong>When sensitive data is segregated and encrypted, it adds an additional layer of protection</strong> in the event of an accidental exposure or malicious attack.</p><p>
Moreover, multi-factor authentication (MFA) should be a requirement for any application where the user has access to potentially sensitive information or documents. By requiring MFA, even if user credentials (like username and password) are exposed, it is more difficult for someone to simply login and gain full access to the application or user dashboard.</p><p>
Lastly, for healthtech companies of any size, <strong>it is a good idea to have a data breach response plan in place and a dedicated communication channel for reporting potential security incidents.</strong> Far too often I observe that companies have only customer support or sales contacts listed, forgoing the contact information of key stakeholders who need to act in case of a data breach. When sensitive data is publicly exposed, every second counts, and any delay in mitigation and recovery could be potentially catastrophic.</p><p>
It is also important to give timely responsible disclosure notices to anybody who could be directly affected by the breach. After any data incident, users should be notified and educated on how to recognize phishing attempts in relation to the specific application or service that was potentially compromised. Protecting users from the real risks of social engineering and phishing attempts makes common sense and benefits both the service provider and the user or customer.</p><p>
I imply no wrongdoing by Shiftster LLC dba ESHYFT, any contractors or affiliates. I do not claim that internal data or user data was ever at imminent risk. The hypothetical data-risk scenarios I have presented in this report are exclusively for educational purposes and do not reflect any actual compromise of data integrity. It should not be construed as a reflection of any organization’s specific practices, systems, or security measures.</p><p>
As an ethical security researcher, I do not download the data I discover. I only take a limited number of screenshots solely for verification purposes. I do not conduct any activities beyond identifying the security vulnerability and notifying the relevant parties. I disclaim any responsibility for any and all actions that may be taken as a result of this disclosure. I publish my findings to raise awareness on issues of data security and privacy. My aim is to encourage organizations to proactively safeguard sensitive information against unauthorized access.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="Box">



<p>In the two decades I’ve been in this racket, I’ve never been angrier at myself for missing a story than I am about Apple’s <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/apple_is_delaying_the_more_personalized_siri_apple_intelligence_features">announcement on Friday</a> that the “more personalized Siri” features of Apple Intelligence, scheduled to appear between now and WWDC, would be delayed until “the coming year”.</p>

<p>I should have my head examined. </p>

<p>This announcement dropped as a surprise, and certainly took me by surprise to some extent, but it was all there from the start. I should have been pointing out red flags starting back at WWDC last year, and I am embarrassed and sorry that I didn’t see what should have been very clear to me from the start.</p>

<p>How I missed this is twofold. First, I’d been lulled into complacency by Apple’s track record of consistently shipping pre-announced products and features. Their record in that regard wasn’t perfect, but the exceptions tended to be around the edges. (Nobody was particularly clamoring for Apple to make a multi-device inductive charging mat, so it never generated too much controversy <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/apple_is_delaying_the_more_personalized_siri_apple_intelligence_features#fn1-2025-03-07">when AirPower turned out to be a complete bust</a>.) Second, I was foolishly distracted by the “Apple Intelligence” brand umbrella. It’s a fine idea for Apple to brand its AI features under an umbrella term like that, similar to how a bunch of disparate features that allow different Apple devices to interoperate are under the “<a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/continuity/">Continuity</a>” umbrella. But there’s no such thing, technically speaking, as “Continuity”. It’s not like there’s an Xcode project inside Apple named Continuity.xcodeproj, and all the code that supports everything from AirDrop to Sidecar to iPhone Mirroring to clipboard sharing is all implemented in the same framework of code. It’s a marketing term, but a useful one — it helps Apple explain the features, and helps users understand them.</p>

<p>The same goes for “Apple Intelligence”. It doesn’t exist as a single thing or project. It’s a marketing term for a collection of features, apps, and services. Putting it all under a single obvious, easily remembered — and <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/design/print-design-publishing/apples-new-billboard-ads-are-um-not-great">easily promoted</a> — name makes it easier for users to understand that Apple is launching a new initiative. It also makes it easier for Apple to just say “<em>These are the devices that qualify for all of these features, and other devices — older ones, less expensive ones — get none of them.</em>”</p>

<p>Let’s say Apple were to quietly abandon the dumb Image Playground app next year. It just disappears from iOS 19 and MacOS 16. That would just be Apple eliminating a silly app that almost no one uses or should use. That wouldn’t be a setback or rollback of “Apple Intelligence”. I would actually argue that axing Image Playground would improve Apple Intelligence; its mere existence greatly lowers the expectations for how good the whole thing is.<sup id="fnr1-2025-03-12"><a href="#fn1-2025-03-12">1</a></sup></p>

<p>What I mean by that is that it was clear to me from the WWDC keynote onward that some of the features and aspects of Apple Intelligence were more ambitious than others. Some were downright trivial; others were proposing to redefine how we will do our jobs and interact with our most-used devices. That was clear. But yet somehow I didn’t focus on it. Apple itself strongly hinted that the various features in Apple Intelligence wouldn’t all ship at the same time. What they didn’t spell out, but anyone could intuit, was that the more trivial features would ship first, and the more ambitious features later. That’s where the red flags should have been obvious to me.</p>

<p>In broad strokes, there are four stages of “doneness” or “realness” to features announced by any company:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Features that the company’s own product representatives will demo, themselves, in front of the media. Smaller, more personal demonstrations are more credible than on-stage demos. But the stakes for demo fail are higher in an auditorium full of observers.</p></li>
<li><p>Features that the company will allow members of the media (or other invited outside observers and experts) to try themselves, for a limited time, under the company’s supervision and guidance. Vision Pro demos were like this at WWDC 2023. A bunch of us got to use pre-release hardware and in-progress software for 30 minutes. It wasn’t like free range “Do whatever you want” — it was a guided tour. But we were the ones actually using the product. Apple allowed hands-on demos for a handful of media (not me) at Macworld Expo <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/186251/ihnatkoiphone.html">back in 2007 with prototype original iPhones</a> — some of the “apps” were just screenshots, but most of the iPhone actually worked.</p></li>
<li><p>Features that are released as beta software for developers, enthusiasts, and the media to use on their own devices, without limitation or supervision.</p></li>
<li><p>Features that actually ship to regular users, and hardware that regular users can just go out and buy.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>As of today — March 2025 — every feature in Apple Intelligence <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/02/26/this-is-every-apple-intelligence-feature-thats-available-now/">that has actually shipped</a> was at level 1 back at WWDC. After the keynote, dozens of us in the press were invited to a series of small-group briefings where we got to watch Apple reps demo features like Writing Tools, Photos Clean Up, Genmoji, and more. We got to see predictive code completion in Xcode. What has shipped, as of today, they were able to show, in some functional state, in June.</p>

<p>For example, there was a demo involving a draft email message on an iPad, and the Apple rep used Writing Tools to make it “more friendly”. I was in a group of just four or five other members of the media, watching this. As usual, we were encouraged to interrupt with questions. Knowing that LLMs are non-deterministic, I asked whether, as the Apple rep was performing this same demo for each successive group of media members, the “more friendly” result was exactly the same each time. He laughed and said no — that while the results are very similar each time, and he hopes they continue to be (hence the laughing), that there were subtle differences sometimes between different runs of the same demo. As I recall, he even used Undo to go back to the original message text, invoked Writing Tools to make it “more friendly” again, and we could see that a few of the word choices were slightly different. That answered both my explicit question and my implicit one: Writing Tools generates non-deterministic results, and, more importantly, what we were watching really was a live demo.</p>

<p>We didn’t get to try any of the Apple Intelligence features ourselves. There was no Apple Intelligence “hands on”. But we did see a bunch of features demoed, live, by Apple folks. In my above hierarchy of realness, they were all at level 1.</p>

<p>But we didn’t see <em>all</em> aspects of Apple Intelligence demoed. None of the “more personalized Siri” features, the ones that Apple, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/apple_is_delaying_the_more_personalized_siri_apple_intelligence_features">in its own statement announcing their postponement</a>, described as having “more awareness of your personal context, as well as the ability to take action for you within and across your apps”. Those features encompass three main things:</p>

<ul>
<li>“Personal context” — Knowing details and information about you from a “semantic index”, built from the contents of your email, messages, files, contacts, and more. In theory, eventually, all the information on your device that you wish to share with Siri will be in this semantic index. If you can look it up on your device, Siri will be able to look it up on your device.</li>
<li>“Onscreen awareness” — Giving Siri awareness of whatever is displayed on your screen. <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-intelligence/">Apple’s own example usage</a>: “If a friend texts you their new address, you can say ‘Add this address to their contact card,’ and Siri will take care of it.”</li>
<li><p>“In-app actions” — Giving Siri the ability, through the App Intents framework, to do things in and across apps that <em>you</em> can do, the old fashioned way (yourself) in and across apps. Again, here’s Apple’s own example usage:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can make a request like “Send the email I drafted to April and
Lilly” and Siri knows which email you’re referencing and which app
it’s in. And Siri can take actions across apps, so after you ask
Siri to enhance a photo for you by saying “Make this photo pop,”
you can ask Siri to drop it in a specific note in the Notes app — without lifting a finger.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<p>There were no demonstrations of <em>any</em> of that. Those features were all at level 0 on my hierarchy. That level is called vaporware. They were features Apple <em>said</em> existed, which they <em>claimed</em> would be shipping in the next year, and which they <em>portrayed</em>, to great effect, in the signature “Siri, when is my mom’s flight landing?” segment of the WWDC keynote itself, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/RXeOiIDNNek?t=4934">starting around the 1h:22m mark</a>. Apple was either unwilling or unable to demonstrate those features in action back in June, even with Apple product marketing reps performing the demos from a prepared script using prepared devices.</p>

<p>This shouldn’t have just raised a concern in my head. It should have set off blinding red flashing lights and deafening klaxon alarms.</p>

<p>Even the very engineers working on a project never know exactly how long something is going to take to complete. An outsider observing a scripted demo of incomplete software knows far less (than the engineers) just how much more work it needs. But you can make a rough judgment. And that’s where my aforementioned hierarchy of realness comes into play. Even outsiders can judge how close a public beta (stage 3) feels to readiness. A feature or product that Apple will allow the press to play with, hands-on (stage 2) is further along than a feature or product that Apple is only willing to demonstrate themselves (stage 1).</p>

<p>But a feature or product that Apple is unwilling to demonstrate, at all, is unknowable. Is it mostly working, and close to, but not quite, demonstratable? Is it only kinda sorta working — partially functional, but far from being complete? Fully functional but prone to crashing — or in the case of AI, prone to hallucinations and falsehoods? Or is it complete fiction, just an idea at this point?</p>

<p>What Apple showed regarding the upcoming “personalized Siri” at WWDC was <em>not</em> a demo. It was a concept video. Concept videos are bullshit, and a sign of a company in disarray, if not crisis. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2011/11/companies_that_publish_concept_videos">The Apple that commissioned the futuristic “Knowledge Navigator” concept video</a> in 1987 was the Apple that was on a course to near-bankruptcy a decade later. Modern Apple — the post-NeXT-reunification Apple of the last quarter century — does not publish concept videos. They only demonstrate actual working products and features.</p>

<p>Until WWDC last year, that is.</p>

<p>My deeply misguided mental framework for “Apple Intelligence” last year at WWDC was, something like this: <em>Some of these features are further along than others, and Apple is showing us those features in action first, and they will surely be the features that ship first over the course of the next year. The other features must be coming to demonstratable status soon.</em> But the mental framework I should have used was more like this: <em>Some of these features are merely table stakes for generative AI in 2024, but others are ambitious, groundbreaking, and, given their access to personal data, potentially dangerous. Apple is only showing us the table-stakes features, and isn’t demonstrating any of the ambitious, groundbreaking, risky features.</em></p>

<p>It gets worse. Come September, Apple held its annual big event at Apple Park to unveil the iPhone 16 lineup. Apple Intelligence features were highlighted in the announcement. Members of the media from around the world were gathered. That was a new opportunity, three months after WWDC, for Apple to demonstrate — or even better, offer hands-on access to the press to try themselves — the new personalized Siri features. They did not. No demos, at all. But they did promote them, once again, in the event keynote.<sup id="fnr2-2025-03-12"><a href="#fn2-2025-03-12">2</a></sup></p>

<p>But yet while Apple still wouldn’t demonstrate these features in person, they did commission and broadcast a TV commercial showing these purported features in action, presenting them as a reason to purchase a new iPhone — <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/08/apple-pulls-bella-ramsey-ad-that-promoted-vaporware-personalized-siri-feature">a commercial they pulled, without comment, from YouTube this week</a>.</p>

<p>Last week’s announcement — “It’s going to take us longer than we thought to deliver on these features and we anticipate rolling them out in the coming year” — was, if you think about it, another opportunity to demonstrate the current state of these features. Rather than simply issue a statement to the media, they could have invited select members of the press to Apple Park, or Apple’s offices in New York, or even just remotely over a WebEx conference call, and demonstrate the current state of these features live, on an actual device. That didn’t happen. If these features exist in any sort of working state at all, no one outside Apple has vouched for their existence, let alone for their quality.</p>

<h2>Duke Nukem Intelligence</h2>

<p>Why did Apple show these personalized Siri features at WWDC last year, and promise their arrival during the first year of Apple Intelligence? Why, for that matter, do they now claim to “anticipate rolling them out in the coming year” if they still currently do not exist in demonstratable form? (If they <em>do</em> exist today in demonstratable form, they should, you know, <em>demonstrate them</em>.)</p>

<p>I’m not trying to be obtuse here. It’s obvious why some executives at Apple might have <em>hoped</em> they could promote features like these at WWDC last year. Generative AI is the biggest thing to happen in the computer industry since previous breakthroughs this century like mobile (starting with the iPhone, followed by Android), social media (Meta), and cloud computing (Microsoft, Google, and Amazon). Nobody knows where it’s going but wherever it’s heading, it’s going to be big, important, and perhaps profitable. Wall Street certainly noticed. And prior to WWDC last year, Apple wasn’t in the game. They needed to pitch their AI story. And a story that involved nothing but table-stakes AI features isn’t nearly as compelling a story as one that involves innovative, breakthrough, ambitious personal features.</p>

<p>But while there’s an obvious appeal to Apple pitching the most compelling, most ambitious AI story possible, the only thing that was essential was telling a story that was true. If the truth was that Apple only had features ready to ship in the coming year that were table-stakes compared to the rest of the industry, that’s the story they needed to tell. Put as good a spin on it as possible, but them’s the breaks when you’re late to the game.</p>

<p>The fiasco here is not that Apple is late on AI. It’s also not that they had to announce an embarrassing delay on promised features last week. Those are problems, not fiascos, and problems happen. They’re inevitable. Leaders prove their mettle and create their legacies not by how they deal with successes but by how they deal with — how they acknowledge, understand, adapt, and solve — problems. The fiasco is that Apple pitched a story that wasn’t true, one that <em>some</em> people within the company surely understood wasn’t true, and they set a course based on that. </p>

<p>The Apple of the Jobs exile years — the Sculley / Spindler / Amelio Apple of 1987–1997 — promoted all sorts of amazing concepts that were no more real than the dinosaurs of <em>Jurassic Park</em>, and promised all sorts of hardware and (especially) software that never saw the light of day. Promoting what you <em>hope</em> to be able to someday ship is way easier and more exciting than promoting what you <em>know</em> is actually ready to ship. However close to financial bankruptcy Apple was when Steve Jobs returned as CEO after the NeXT reunification, the company was already completely bankrupt of credibility. Apple today is the most profitable and financially successful company in the history of the world. Everyone notices such success, and the corresponding accumulation of great wealth. Less noticed, but to my mind the more impressive achievement, is that over the last three decades, the company <em>also</em> accumulated an abundant reserve of credibility. When Apple showed a feature, you could bank on that feature being real. When they said something was set to ship in the coming year, it would ship in the coming year. In the worst case, maybe that “year” would have to be stretched to 13 or 14 months. You can stretch the truth and maintain credibility, but you can’t maintain credibility with bullshit. And the “more personalized Siri” features, it turns out, were bullshit.</p>

<p>Keynote by keynote, product by product, feature by feature, year after year after year, Apple went from a company that you couldn’t believe would even remain solvent, to, by far, the most credible company in tech. Apple remains at no risk of financial bankruptcy (and in fact remains the most profitable company in the world). But their credibility is now damaged. Careers will end before Apple might ever return to the level of “if they say it, you can believe it” credibility the company had earned at the start of June 2024.</p>

<p><em>Damaged</em> is arguably too passive. It was <em>squandered</em>. This didn’t happen to Apple. Decision makers within the company did it.</p>

<p><em>Who</em> decided these features should go in the WWDC keynote, with a promise they’d arrive in the coming year, when, at the time, they were in such an unfinished state they could not be demoed to the media even in a controlled environment? Three months later, who decided Apple should double down and advertise these features in a TV commercial, and promote them as a selling point of the iPhone 16 lineup — not just any products, but the very crown jewels of the company and the envy of the entire industry — when those features still remained in such an unfinished or perhaps even downright non-functional state that they <em>still</em> could not be demoed to the press? Not just couldn’t be shipped as beta software. Not just couldn’t be used by members of the press in a hands-on experience, but could not even be shown to work by Apple employees on Apple-controlled devices in an Apple-controlled environment? But yet they advertised them in a commercial for the iPhone 16, when it turns out they won’t ship, in the best case scenario, until months after the iPhone 17 lineup is unveiled?</p>

<p>When that whole campaign of commercials appeared, I — along with many other observers — was distracted by the fact that <em>none</em> of the features in Apple Intelligence had yet shipped. It’s highly unusual, and arguably ill-considered, for Apple to advertise <em>any</em> features that haven’t yet shipped. But one of those commercials was not at all like the others. The other commercials featured Apple Intelligence features that were close to shipping. We know today they were close to shipping because they were either in the iOS 18.1 betas already, in September, or would soon appear in developer betas for iOS 18.2 and 18.3. Right now, today, they’ve all actually shipped and are in the hands of iPhone 16 users. But the “Siri, what’s the name of the guy I had a meeting with a couple of months ago at Cafe Grenel?” commercial was entirely based on a feature Apple still has never even demonstrated.</p>

<p>Who said “<em>Sure, let’s promise this</em>” and then “<em>Sure, let’s advertise it</em>”? And who said “<em>Are you crazy, this isn’t ready, this doesn’t work, we can’t promote this now?</em>” And most important, who made the call which side to listen to? Presumably, that person was Tim Cook.</p>

<p>Even with everything Apple overpromised (if not outright lied about) at the WWDC keynote, the initial takeaway from WWDC from the news media was wrongly focused on their partnership with OpenAI. The conventional wisdom coming out of the keynote was that Apple had just announced something called “Apple Intelligence” but it was powered by ChatGPT, when in fact, the story Apple told was that they — Apple — had built an entire system called Apple Intelligence, entirely powered by Apple’s own AI technology, and that it spanned from on-device execution all the way to a new Private Cloud Compute infrastructure they not only owned but are powering with their own custom-designed server hardware based on Apple Silicon chips. And that on top of all that, as a proverbial cherry on top, Apple <em>also</em> was adding an optional integration layer with ChatGPT.</p>

<p>So, yes, given that the news media gave credit for Apple’s own actual announced achievements to OpenAI, Apple surely would have been given even <em>less</em> credit had they not announced the “more personalized Siri” features. It’s easy to imagine someone in the executive ranks arguing “<em>We need to show something that only Apple can do.</em>” But it turns out they announced something Apple <em>couldn’t</em> do. And now they look so out of their depth, so in over their heads, that not only are they years behind the state-of-the-art in AI, but they don’t even know <em>what</em> they can ship or <em>when</em>. Their headline features from nine months ago not only haven’t shipped but still haven’t even been demonstrated, which I, for one, now presume means they <em>can’t</em> be demonstrated <em>because they don’t work</em>.</p>

<h2>‘So Why the Fuck Doesn’t It Do That?’</h2>

<p>In May 2011, <a href="https://fortune.com/article/inside-apple/">Fortune published an extraordinary look inside Apple by Adam Lashinsky</a>, at what we now know to be the peak, and (alas) end, of the Steve Jobs era. The piece opens thus:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple doesn’t often fail, and when it does, it isn’t a pretty
sight at 1 Infinite Loop. In the summer of 2008, when Apple
launched the first version of its iPhone that worked on
third-generation mobile networks, it also debuted MobileMe, an
e-mail system that was supposed to provide the seamless
synchronization features that corporate users love about their
BlackBerry smartphones. MobileMe was a dud. Users complained about
lost e-mails, and syncing was spotty at best. Though reviewers
gushed over the new iPhone, they panned the MobileMe service.</p>

<p>Steve Jobs doesn’t tolerate duds. Shortly after the launch event,
he summoned the MobileMe team, gathering them in the Town Hall
auditorium in Building 4 of Apple’s campus, the venue the company
uses for intimate product unveilings for journalists. According to
a participant in the meeting, Jobs walked in, clad in his
trademark black mock turtleneck and blue jeans, clasped his hands
together, and asked a simple question:</p>

<p>“Can anyone tell me what MobileMe is supposed to do?” Having
received a satisfactory answer, he continued, “So why the fuck
doesn’t it do that?”</p>

<p>For the next half-hour Jobs berated the group. “You’ve tarnished
Apple’s reputation,” he told them. “You should hate each other for
having let each other down.” The public humiliation particularly
infuriated Jobs. Walt Mossberg, the influential Wall Street
Journal gadget columnist, had panned MobileMe. “Mossberg, our
friend, is no longer writing good things about us,” Jobs said. On
the spot, Jobs named a new executive to run the group.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tim Cook should have already held a meeting like that to address and rectify this Siri and Apple Intelligence debacle. If such a meeting hasn’t yet occurred or doesn’t happen soon, then, I fear, that’s all she wrote. The ride is over. When mediocrity, excuses, and bullshit take root, they take over. A culture of excellence, accountability, and integrity cannot abide the acceptance of any of those things, and will quickly collapse upon itself with the acceptance of all three.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <article role="article">
  
  
  <div><p>EFF is deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Mark Klein, a bona fide hero who risked civil liability and criminal prosecution to help expose a massive spying program that violated the rights of millions of Americans.</p>
<p>Mark didn’t set out to change the world. For 22 years, he was a telecommunications technician for AT&amp;T, most of that in San Francisco. But he always had a strong sense of right and wrong and a commitment to privacy.</p>
<p><span>Mark not only saw how it works, he had the documents to prove it.</span></p>
<p>When the New York Times reported in late 2005 that the NSA was engaging in spying inside the U.S., Mark realized that he had witnessed how it was happening. He also realized that the President was not telling Americans the truth about the program. And, though newly retired, he knew that he had to do something. He showed up at EFF’s front door in early 2006 with a simple question: “Do you folks care about privacy?”&nbsp;</p>
<p>We did. And what Mark told us changed everything. Through his work, Mark had learned that the National Security Agency (NSA) had installed a secret, secure room at AT&amp;T’s central office in San Francisco, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_641A">Room 641A</a>. Mark was assigned to connect circuits carrying Internet data to optical “splitters” that sat just outside of the secret NSA room but were hardwired into it. Those splitters—as well as similar ones in cities around the U.S.—<a href="https://www.eff.org/files/2014/07/24/backbone-3c-color.jpg">made a copy</a> of all data going through those circuits and delivered it into the secret room.</p>
<div><p><img src="https://www.eff.org/files/2025/03/12/secretroom1_f.jpg" width="500" height="373" alt="Photo of NSA-controlled &quot;secret room&quot; " title="Photo of NSA-controlled &quot;secret room&quot; "></p></div>
<p>Mark not only saw how it works, he had the documents to prove it. He brought us over a hundred pages of authenticated AT&amp;T schematic diagrams and tables. Mark also shared this information with major media outlets, numerous Congressional staffers, and at least two senators personally. One, Senator <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pylu8ycLfC4">Chris Dodd</a>, took the floor of the Senate to acknowledge Mark as the great American hero he was.</p>
<p>We used Mark’s evidence to bring two lawsuits against the <a href="https://www.eff.org/nsa-spying">NSA spying</a> that he uncovered. The first was <a href="https://www.eff.org/cases/hepting">Hepting v. AT&amp;T</a> and the second was <a href="https://www.eff.org/cases/jewel">Jewel v. NSA</a>. Mark also came with us to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/07/us/07nsa.html">Washington D.C</a>. to push for an end to the spying and demand accountability for it happening in secret for so many years.&nbsp; He wrote an account of his experience called <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6625940-wiring-up-the-big-brother-machine-and-fighting-it"><em>Wiring Up the Big Brother Machine . . . And Fighting It</em>.</a></p>
<div><p><img src="https://www.eff.org/files/2025/03/12/mark-klein-washington.jpg" width="1284" height="633" alt="cartoon featuring Mark Klein climbing Capitol Hill" title="cartoon featuring Mark Klein climbing Capitol Hill"></p><p>Archival EFF graphic promoting Mark Klein's DC tour</p></div>
<p>Mark stood up and told the truth at great personal risk to himself and his family. AT&amp;T threatened to sue him, although it wisely decided not to do so. While we were able to use his evidence to make some change, both EFF and Mark were ultimately let down by Congress and the Courts, which have refused to take the steps necessary to end the mass spying even after Edward Snowden provided even more evidence of it in 2013.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But Mark certainly inspired all of us at EFF, and he helped inspire and inform hundreds of thousands of ordinary Americans to demand an end to illegal mass surveillance. While we have not yet seen the success in ending the spying that we all have hoped for, his bravery helped to usher numerous reforms so far.</p>
<p>And the fight is not over. The law, <a href="https://www.eff.org/702-spying">called Section 702</a>, that now authorizes the continued surveillance that Mark first revealed, expires in early 2026. EFF and others will continue to push for continued reforms and, ultimately, for the illegal spying to end entirely.</p>
<p>Mark’s legacy lives on in our continuing fights to reform surveillance and honor the Fourth Amendment’s promise of protecting personal privacy. We are forever grateful to him for having the courage to stand up and will do our best to honor that legacy by continuing the fight.&nbsp;</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://sr.ht/~oconnor0/zinc/">https://sr.ht/~oconnor0/zinc/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43346864">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Zinc is my attempt at a low-level systems programming language prototype.
I found this parser, called <a href="https://github.com/ianh/owl" rel="nofollow noopener">Owl</a> mirrored <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~oconnor0/owl" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>, that generates parsers for visibly pushdown languages.
Visibly pushdown languages are those where recursion to other grammar productions must be guarded by tokens which can only be used for that purpose.
While somewhat limiting, this ends up meaning that all grammar productions that can "contain" other productions are wrapped in certain tokens and so the language is visually easier to parse.
And it runs in linear time.</p>
<pre><code>mut i = 0
def n = 10
while 0 &lt;= i &lt; n {
    def x = call rndi()
    if i = 0 {
        ; verify that the fixed seed rng is working as expected
        assert "rndi() = 13109595": x = 13109595
    }
    call puti(x)
    call putc(10)
    set i = i + 1
}
return i
</code></pre>
<h3 id="features"><a href="#features" rel="nofollow noopener">#</a>Features!</h3>
<ol>
<li>All statements start with a keyword, except for blocks with start and end with curly braces.</li>
<li>Range conditionals like you used in math: <code>0 &lt;= i &lt; 100</code></li>
<li>Builtin <code>assert</code> syntax - that's included in all compliation modes. Make sure things are what you expect them to be.</li>
<li>Add new functions by defining them in the <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~oconnor0/zinc-proto/tree/HEAD/lib/prelude.h" rel="nofollow noopener"><code>lib/prelude.h</code></a>.</li>
<li><code>if</code> and <code>while</code> statements don't need parentheses around their conditional.</li>
<li>Mutable variables and immutable bindings.</li>
<li>Semicolons used to comment out the rest of the line.</li>
<li>The language splits side-effects from non-side-effecting code. Or rather would once functions and subroutines are implemented. Subroutines can have side-effects, functions cannot. Expressions can only apply functions, not call subroutines. It's like Haskell but better.</li>
<li>No package manager to distract you.</li>
<li>Simple type system. Currently, a unityped language - everything is an int - except for the optional <code>assert</code> message.</li>
<li>No need to write functions. Top-level code in a <code>.zn</code> is executed when the file is included.</li>
<li>No package/file/module imports yet. I had some idea about compiling each file to a struct, but whether there was one of them or multiple of them was undecided. And there's always the issue of what to do about side-effects on module load.</li>
<li>No nil. No pointers or references either. I wondered how far I could get with this model, maybe using arrays or structs or arenas or static allocations or something.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="status"><a href="#status" rel="nofollow noopener">#</a>Status</h3>
<p>While I dreamed of integrating it with some 2D graphics or tile engine and playing around with old-school game dev, I ran into a few limitations with its design.
Like how cool would it be to write a clone of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raptor:_Call_of_the_Shadows" rel="nofollow noopener">Raptor: Call of the Shadows</a> in a language I wrote?</p>
<p>I intended to write it as a single-pass compiler directly from the syntax tree and targeting C via TCC to enable it to run quickly and on any platform.
Unfortunately I also designed a language with top-level execution and nested functions - neither of which I could come up with a good compilation model for if I wanted to preserve the single-pass, no AST, no IR design of the compiler.
It's certainly possible there is a model, but my musings couldn't figure it out.</p>
<p>The reality is too that I've been a programmer in GC languages my entire career (if you ignore the 5 years I did C++ and Verilog) and that's where my mind resides so writing a low-level limited language was, well, limiting.</p>

<h3 id="goals"><a href="#goals" rel="nofollow noopener">#</a>Goals</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cross-platform - don't have to install Unix to get compiles on Windows to work. Don't depend on platform-specific tools.
<ul>
<li>Cross-compiling - compile to other targets - OS and architecture - easily.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Single executable (optionally) with compiler, assembler, linker.</li>
<li>Can run without an OS.</li>
<li>Standard library is optional, but large-ish.</li>
<li>Core library is dynamic allocation free.</li>
<li>Low-level and easier, for me, to program in than C.</li>
<li>No magic - implicit casts, lots of optimizations for zero cost abstractions.</li>
<li>Prioritize simplicity - compiler or developer though?</li>
<li>To be a language I want to write in.</li>
<li>To be the implementation language for an application and a scripting programming language to come later.</li>
<li>Reasonable C interop, and probably, initial compilation to C.</li>
<li>Package system, should one develop, doesn't support transitive dependencies.</li>
<li>To eventually support a simple, cross-platform graphics.h or MODE 13h style graphics library.</li>
<li>To include a console.h/TUI style library.</li>
<li>Inline assembler.</li>
<li>Small and clean and sane language.</li>
<li>Some kind of module system.</li>
<li>Arbitrary, or principled, restrictions.</li>
<li>Builtin SIMD?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="non-goals"><a href="#non-goals" rel="nofollow noopener">#</a>Non-goals</h3>

<h3 id="open-questions"><a href="#open-questions" rel="nofollow noopener">#</a>Open questions</h3>
<ul>
<li>How do modules and types interact?</li>
<li>How are runtime and compile time separated? How do they interact?</li>
<li>Where does polymorphism fit in? Parametric? Monomorphization?</li>
<li>What is the relationship between statements and expressions?</li>
