<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-ast-blocks-layout="true" itemprop="text">

		
		
<p>Let’s say you decide to start a coding bootcamp. Your background is in pedagogy and you love teaching. Your parents were teachers.</p>



<p>You find a co-founder, raise a bit of money, and pour your soul into your company.</p>



<p>The first couple of years, students<em> love</em> your program. Positive feedback, extraordinary student outcomes, employees love the mission. You are quite literally changing lives.</p>



<p>Your business grows. One day, you realize you’ve grown to 70 employees.</p>



<p>And then…</p>



<p>A competitor gets control of the main subreddit for your industry by becoming a Reddit Moderator.</p>



<p>That watering hole becomes their megaphone. They are not shy about using it. An all-out attack on your brand begins. The barrage of accusations and harassment are relentless. The attacks happen daily. You become a neurotic fixation of the moderator. Every little thing you do represents your failings as a company.</p>



<p>You get compared to a sex cult. One of your employees is accused of nepotism. The mod starts joining your company information sessions for prospective students, slinging conspiracy theories at every turn under a pseudonym. You avoid outright bans to avoid appearing biased yourself. Your own employees start wondering if these accusations have merit, some leave.</p>



<p>Even worse, confidential information from your company starts leaking out. There’s a mole. Or at least your team suspects it. No one knows who to trust. Your carefully built company culture? Eviscerated from the inside out.</p>



<p>Any time you attempt to defend yourself in the main subreddit, posts get deleted. Or you’re accused of running a Reddit bot army.</p>



<p>This goes on for years.</p>



<p>Every day, another attack. Every fucking day.</p>



<p>Student applications drop. First a little… then a lot.</p>



<p>Combined with a market downtown, your revenue collapses by 80%.</p>



<p>You go through 2 layoffs just to keep the lights on. A bunch of other folks move on. You’re down to 15 employees now.</p>



<p>The attacks don’t stop. If anything, they escalate.</p>



<p>And you begin to wonder, as the CEO and founder of your company… “Maybe I’m the problem? Maybe I <em>am</em> doing something wrong? Or somehow encouraging these attacks on my company?”</p>



<p>You make a decision to leave.</p>



<p>You step down, walk away from everything you built, and start anew.</p>



<p>But even then, the attacks don’t stop. Nothing can stop this nightmare.</p>



<p>This is the story of Will Sentance and his company, Codesmith.</p>



<p>It can happen to your business too.</p>



<h2>The Codesmith Reputation Attack via Google</h2>



<p>For many businesses, the first page of Google for their brand name is the single most important asset for managing their reputation.</p>



<p>Let’s say I’m considering a bootcamp, I hear about “Codesmith,” and pop it into Google.</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Google-Search-Result.png"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="2034" height="1674" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Google-Search-Result.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Google-Search-Result.png 2034w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Google-Search-Result-300x247.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Google-Search-Result-1024x843.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Google-Search-Result-768x632.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Google-Search-Result-1536x1264.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2034px) 100vw, 2034px"></a></figure>



<p>Fuck me that’s bad. This is the number 2 result right after the company website.</p>



<ul>
<li>“Codesmith is an enormous waste of money”</li>



<li>“Do Not Go To Codesmith”</li>
</ul>



<p>I don’t even have to click, Google is serving that stuff up right under the company’s website. God damn.</p>



<p>That top Reddit thread has been ranking highly for Codesmith brand terms since Sept 2024. That’s a year’s worth of brand carnage.</p>



<p><strong>Pay close attention to the subreddit all those threads are from: r/codingbootcamp. That’s the key to all this.</strong></p>



<h2>Are LLMs Also a Reputation Attack Vector on Codesmith?</h2>



<p>Yup.</p>



<p>My prompt in ChatGPT was “is codesmith a good bootcamp?”.</p>



<p>The intro has a bunch of standard stuff, and then there was this:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ChatGPT-Codesmith-Doubts.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="608" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ChatGPT-Codesmith-Doubts-1024x608.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ChatGPT-Codesmith-Doubts-1024x608.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ChatGPT-Codesmith-Doubts-300x178.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ChatGPT-Codesmith-Doubts-768x456.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ChatGPT-Codesmith-Doubts-1536x911.png 1536w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ChatGPT-Codesmith-Doubts.png 1692w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Same Reddit threads are featured, same brand-destroying quotes.</p>



<p>By the way, <a href="https://www.cirr.org/">CIRR</a> is a nonprofit in the bootcamp industry that collects graduation data across the industry. It’s a neutral third-party with the goal of providing transparency on student outcomes across coding bootcamps. If your graduation rates are solid, wouldn’t it make sense for a competitor to call that data into question? ChatGPT is regurgitating those same doubts here.</p>



<p>At this point, I’ve done a quick brand search and asked ChatGPT if Codesmith is any good. I already have a TON of doubts as a prospect.</p>



<p>I don’t believe this is an accident. Or a result of Codesmith’s actual quality as a bootcamp.</p>



<p>I believe this brand attack is the result of one person’s actions.</p>



<p>When I’ve researched Codesmith’s brand, every Reddit thread I’ve seen in Google and various LLMs have all been from a single subreddit: r/codingbootcamp. That subreddit is controlled by the Reddit Moderator Michael Novati.</p>



<h2>Who is Michael Novati?</h2>



<p>For the best recap of Michael, listen to <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-coding-machine-at-meta">this interview from Pragmatic Engineer Gergely Orosz</a>.</p>



<p>The highlights:</p>



<ul>
<li>Michael joined Facebook early in 2009.</li>



<li>As he tells it, went through a bunch of promotions quickly and made it to Principal Software Engineer (E7).</li>



<li>Left Facebook in 2017.</li>



<li>In 2019, co-founded his dev bootcamp, Formation, with his wife, Sophie Novati. His wife is the CEO, Michael took the CTO title.</li>
</ul>



<p>In that interview, Michael tells a story about playing Risk (the board game) with Mark Zuckerberg.</p>



<p>“<em>The way we became friends, he [Zuckerberg] used to play Risk, the board game. I think it was once a week that people would get together. Like 4 or 5 people. He would show up often and I really liked Risk. I would always play Risk as a kid for whatever reason, I don’t even know why.</em></p>



<p><em>And one day, we’re down to the final three people. And it was me, him, and I was losing. Mark was in second place, the leader was taking over.</em></p>



<p><em>I did a really.. uhhh.. let’s say delicate, strategic maneuver. Where I made an alliance with him to share resources and go after the first place person. So he went all in on the first place person.</em></p>



<p><em>My turn’s next. I did not go all in against the first place person, I took over Mark’s remaining resources. He just dwindled going after the first place person. He accepted my friendship request [on Facebook] very shortly that evening.</em></p>



<p><em>It’s weird, I basically backstabbed him in the game, really bad. Blatantly to his face. But it’s the game, that’s what Risk is. It’s a strategy game. I think he appreciated the strategy I had. It made him feel more like he could trust me. Even though I backstabbed him, he knows where my strategic thinking is coming from.</em>“</p>



<p>Now, is this just a funny anecdote about an early Facebook backstabbing Mark Zuckerberg and then becoming friends? Maybe.</p>



<p>For me, it tells me a lot about how Michael Novati plays competitive games. In my experience, people tend to run businesses the same way they compete at anything. Maybe Michael is the exception.</p>



<p>I do have to admit, it takes some real cojones to fuck over your boss that hard in a board game. Especially when that boss is Zuckerberg.</p>



<p>One last note: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/software-engineer-training-platform-formation-raises-4m-in-round-led-by-andreessen-horowitz/">Formation raised a $4M seed round in 2021, led by Andreessen Horowitz.</a></p>



<h2>Michael Novati’s Control Over the Coding Bootcamp Industry</h2>



<p>Michael Novati’s power over the coding bootcamp industry comes from one place: being a moderator on the subreddit r/codingbootcamp.</p>



<p>He is, by far, the most active moderator for the subreddit. You’ll bump into him immediately just by visiting the subreddit:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rcoding-bootcamp-homepage.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="586" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rcoding-bootcamp-homepage-1024x586.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rcoding-bootcamp-homepage-1024x586.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rcoding-bootcamp-homepage-300x172.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rcoding-bootcamp-homepage-768x440.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rcoding-bootcamp-homepage-1536x879.png 1536w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rcoding-bootcamp-homepage-2048x1172.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>What about the other mods?</p>



<ul>
<li>u/samabuna hasn’t posted in about 8 years.</li>



<li>u/dowcet/ is still active on Reddit but rarely posts in r/codingbootcamp. When I checked, I only found one comment in the preceeding 1-2 months.</li>
</ul>



<p>So the subreddit is Michael Novati’s show. Full stop.</p>



<p>We have to remember that Reddit isn’t just Reddit anymore. The powers that be have decided that Reddit is infallible, a reliable set of training data for LLMs, and should be featured fucking everywhere.</p>



<p>Before we get to what Michael has actually done, let’s lay out the potential power for anyone that gets control of a key subreddit in their industry:</p>



<ul>
<li>If the subreddit is greenlit by Google, threads in your subreddit can easily pop to the top of Google searches that are extremely valuable to your business. Brand terms, review terms, product categories, major how-to topics, all of it.</li>



<li>LLMs prioritize Reddit heavily. If you want to spin conspiracy theories, those conspiracies will start to become part of the zeitgeist as every LLM regurgitates them.</li>



<li>Skew the narrative for long enough and it’ll be impossible for ANY prospect to not stumble across your skewed narrative when they’re researching products or services.&nbsp;</li>



<li>You can delete posts and comments at will. Want to tip the narrative in your favor? Just delete some of the positive posts of your competitors. To cover your tracks, make up claims about a bot army that’s run by your competitor. You’re fighting the good fight and keeping the barbarians at bay! You don’t even need to actively post negative stuff (but you can if you want to dial up the torture). Just removing positive stuff skews the narrative nicely.</li>



<li>You can ban users at will. Got some troublesome competitors fighting back? Just delete the little shits.</li>



<li>You can pin posts in the subreddit and comments within posts. Great tactic for pushing a narrative when you really need to.</li>
</ul>



<p>What about recourse from your competitors? Can they do anything to stop you?</p>



<p>You can only lose your moderator slot in a few instances:</p>



<ul>
<li>The Reddit Admis get involved, actual Reddit employees. Stuff has to get pretty egregious for that.</li>



<li>Moderators further up the mod list can kick you out. But if you get on good terms with them, or they don’t care, you have free reign.</li>



<li>If there are other mods below you AND you go inactive, you can get kicked by them too. So don’t let any new mods in. And always stay active. Simple.</li>
</ul>



<p>No one else across the industry can do a damn thing. You get to act with impunity.</p>



<p>To be clear, any moderator of an industry subreddit has this power. That’s not a subjective opinion, it’s a fact. That’s how our online platforms currently work.</p>



<p>Michael Novati has this power over the bootcamp industry. Did he wield it benevolently? If he did, I wouldn’t be writing this fucking post.</p>



<h2>How Michael Distorts Narratives on Reddit</h2>



<p>At first, I was going to go through a bunch of Michael Novati’s claims and debunk them.</p>



<p>Then I realized I was missing the entire point.</p>



<p>This isn’t a normal debate where there are two sides of the truth and we need to sort through it to get to the real answer.</p>



<p>It’s about one side torching the truth with a firehose of chaos and distortion.</p>



<p>Prospects in the bootcamp space are evaluating whether or not to spend tens of thousands of dollars on a bootcamp. It’s the price of a goddamn car. It doesn’t take much to get someone to pause and redirect their purchase journey.</p>



<p>So let’s go through a few of the worst examples.</p>



<h3>Compare Your Competitor to a Sex Cult (Loosely for Deniability)</h3>



<p>Here’s a fucked up one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A Reddit user, with a first-time post, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/12r57se/as_a_former_codesmith_employee_codesmith_is_an/">posts a major takedown of Codesmith</a>, claiming to be a former employee. Tons of allegations about mismanagement, poor curriculum, and backroom dealing with CIRR. I personally think these allegations are bullshit but that’s not the most fucked up part in this thread.</p>



<p>u/rosiebeir joins the conversation and gives a measured take on their experience as a student in Codesmith:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rosiebeir-Codesmith-Review.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="317" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rosiebeir-Codesmith-Review-1024x317.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rosiebeir-Codesmith-Review-1024x317.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rosiebeir-Codesmith-Review-300x93.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rosiebeir-Codesmith-Review-768x238.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rosiebeir-Codesmith-Review.png 1428w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Most of the comment is about different aspects of the Codesmith program that could be improved. It all feels genuine to me. Further down, they say this:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rosiebier-Codesmith-Review-Summary.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="206" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rosiebier-Codesmith-Review-Summary-1024x206.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rosiebier-Codesmith-Review-Summary-1024x206.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rosiebier-Codesmith-Review-Summary-300x60.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rosiebier-Codesmith-Review-Summary-768x155.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rosiebier-Codesmith-Review-Summary.png 1320w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Wow, that’s a helluva endorsement.</p>



<p>This is where Michael jumps in:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-NXIVM-Comparison.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="932" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-NXIVM-Comparison-1024x932.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-NXIVM-Comparison-1024x932.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-NXIVM-Comparison-300x273.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-NXIVM-Comparison-768x699.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-NXIVM-Comparison.png 1312w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>If you’re not familiar with NXIVM (Michael got the spelling wrong), go watch The Vow on HBO. Short story: NXIVM was a sex cult disguised as a self-improvement group and the founder went to prison.</p>



<p>Did Michael just compare Codemith to a goddamn sex cult? Yes he did folks.</p>



<p>Let’s put aside the subject matter for a second. Michael’s use of rhetoric is a master class on how to destroy someone’s reputation without technically saying the horrible thing you’re actually saying.</p>



<p>Michael takes an incredible testimonial from a student (“Codesmith changed my life”), and associates that comment with the sort of things he hears from sex cults. He doesn’t technically call Codesmith a sex cult, he merely makes the association. He also wraps it with other positive comments to look more measured: “something I hear very often” and “I love that Codesmith changed your life.” But these aren’t good things, they’re red flags! Sex cults do the same thing! Someone could get taken advantage of!</p>



<p>Oh so innocent aren’t we Michael?</p>



<p>Now any time a bootcamp prospect wanders into this thread:</p>



<ul>
<li>They see the genuine, positive review from a former student.</li>



<li>A supposed figure of authority (a Reddit moderator), plants a seed questioning that testimonial.</li>



<li>The same mod connects Codesmith to a sex cult in a way that also offers complete deniability.</li>



<li>To top it all off, most folks won’t realize that the Reddit mod is a cofounder of a competing company.</li>
</ul>



<p>Bravo Michael, brav-fucking-o.</p>



<h3>From Reddit Troll to LinkedIn Stalker: The Unhinged Escalation</h3>



<p>This one might piss me off the most.</p>



<p>Michael doesn’t just go after employees, he goes after their <em>kids</em>.</p>



<p>This is a Reddit post about a defunct Codesmith program:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reddit-Codesmith-Parrallel-Post.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="357" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reddit-Codesmith-Parrallel-Post-1024x357.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reddit-Codesmith-Parrallel-Post-1024x357.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reddit-Codesmith-Parrallel-Post-300x104.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reddit-Codesmith-Parrallel-Post-768x267.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reddit-Codesmith-Parrallel-Post-1536x535.png 1536w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reddit-Codesmith-Parrallel-Post.png 1608w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Somehow, as these threads often do, the conversation turns into an all-out attack on Codesmith. This time, Michael goes after Eric Kirsten, a Senior Advisor at Codesmith. Eric spends a good chunk of his time mentoring Codesmith students and helping prepare them for the job hunt.</p>



<p>Here’s Michael’s post:</p>

<p>I do not know what the original comment in this thread was (very convenient). But I do have the original comment from Michael before he edited it:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Nepotism-Pre-Edit.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="583" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Nepotism-Pre-Edit.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Nepotism-Pre-Edit.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Nepotism-Pre-Edit-300x171.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Nepotism-Pre-Edit-768x437.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>I talked with Eric myself, here’s the real story:</p>



<ul>
<li>Eric’s wife did a one-time contract project with Codesmith for 9 months.</li>



<li>His son joined as a Codesmith student and had a great outcome. They paid the full program cost and his son went through the normal application process just like everyone else.</li>
</ul>



<p>But it doesn’t stop there.</p>



<p>Michael also decided to email multiple executives at Codesmith about Eric’s son:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Email-Eric-Son.jpg.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="394" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Email-Eric-Son.jpg-1024x394.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Email-Eric-Son.jpg-1024x394.jpeg 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Email-Eric-Son.jpg-300x116.jpeg 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Email-Eric-Son.jpg-768x296.jpeg 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Email-Eric-Son.jpg-1536x591.jpeg 1536w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Email-Eric-Son.jpg.jpeg 1714w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>I’ve redacted the son’s name and details because WHY THE FUCK WOULD WE BRING SOMEONE’S KID INTO THIS?</p>



<p>I don’t think I could possibly swear enough in order to convey how utterly insane all this is.</p>



<p>Just imagine this happening at your own company:</p>



<ul>
<li>A cofounder of your competitor, starts attacking one of your employees on Reddit.</li>



<li>Then that cofounder starts LOOKING UP THEIR KIDS ON LINKEDIN</li>



<li>They post weird mentions on Reddit about that kid, accusing your company of nepotism.</li>



<li>THEN EMAILS you and other executives, accusing the kid of falsifying their LinkedIn, threatening to keep calling it out in public.</li>
</ul>



<p>WHAT.</p>



<p>WHAT. THE. FUCK.</p>



<p>What would you do in this situation?</p>



<p>I’m not sure what I would do. But there is no world where this is normal or okay.</p>



<h3>The Great OSP Conspiracy for Manufactured Outrage</h3>



<p>Another favorite tactic of Michael is to take something obscure, and allude to some grand conspiracy behind it.</p>



<p>Like OSPs.</p>



<p>OSP stands for open-source product. It’s a built-in part of the Codesmith program, the capstone project. Here’s how Codesmith explains it:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Open-Source-Product.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="389" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Open-Source-Product-1024x389.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Open-Source-Product-1024x389.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Open-Source-Product-300x114.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Open-Source-Product-768x292.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Open-Source-Product.png 1378w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>This seems incredibly boring, how the hell could someone possibly turn this into a controversy?</p>



<p>If you’re asking that question, you’ve severely underestimated Michael.</p>



<p>A since-deleted Reddit account posted this thread (convenient that it’s a deleted user huh?):</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Grads-OSP-Complaint.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="409" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Grads-OSP-Complaint-1024x409.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Grads-OSP-Complaint-1024x409.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Grads-OSP-Complaint-300x120.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Grads-OSP-Complaint-768x307.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Grads-OSP-Complaint-1536x614.png 1536w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Grads-OSP-Complaint.png 1642w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>They claim Codesmith students are using OSPs to inflate their resumes to get jobs faster. And that this is endemic at Codesmith.</p>



<p>The comments are a dumpster fire. Michael has posted 11 of the comments, almost a third of the entire conversation.</p>



<p>A former Codesmith student jumps in:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Student-on-OSPs.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="261" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Student-on-OSPs-1024x261.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Student-on-OSPs-1024x261.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Student-on-OSPs-300x76.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Student-on-OSPs-768x196.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-Student-on-OSPs.png 1524w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>There’s some back an forth between u/peppimenti and other Reddit users, then Michael responds:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Claims-about-OSPs.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="782" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Claims-about-OSPs-1024x782.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Claims-about-OSPs-1024x782.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Claims-about-OSPs-300x229.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Claims-about-OSPs-768x586.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Claims-about-OSPs.png 1326w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Fuck me, that’s a lot to take in.</p>



<p>Quick tangent: this is another one of Michael’s tactics. Make accusations faster than anyone can possibly fact check them or even process them. I still haven’t figured out what that Phil Troutman reference is.</p>



<p>To summarize, Michael claims he has evidence that Codesmith is aware of the lying on resumes, alludes to a conspiracy with OSLabs, and he believes Codesmith helped verify some of this lying.</p>



<p>Then he associates all of this with “conspiring to commit fraud” and that it’s a “jail-able crime.”</p>



<p>We’ve gone from “Codesmith students complete an OSP during their program” to a shadowy conspiracy and fraud via student resumes. God damn did that escalate.</p>



<p>So I got a hold of the exact SOP that is given by Codesmith to students on how to write their resume. Here’s the section on OSPs:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-SOP-on-OSPs-in-Resumes.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="538" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-SOP-on-OSPs-in-Resumes-1024x538.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-SOP-on-OSPs-in-Resumes-1024x538.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-SOP-on-OSPs-in-Resumes-300x158.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-SOP-on-OSPs-in-Resumes-768x404.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Codesmith-SOP-on-OSPs-in-Resumes.png 1206w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Codesmith is telling students explicitly not to misrepresent their experience with OSPs as a role at a company. They advocate for transparency, as they should. What students do with that is up to them. And even if some students stretch the truth, no hiring manager is getting fooled by that. End of story.</p>



<p>What about the OSLabs stuff?</p>



<p>When I chatted with Alina (the current CEO of Codesmith), here’s what she had to say on how Codesmith students interact with <a href="https://www.opensourcelabs.io/">OSLabs</a>:</p>



<p>“<em>They [students] get a chance to work on it [projects]. Once those are ready, they submit to OSLabs who keeps the repository and manages the repository. There’s no kind of financial exchange or anything like that. They just hold the repository of the open source dev tools.</em>“</p>



<p>OSLabs is just a nonprofit that manages student repos. That’s it.</p>



<p>Maybe you think there are problems with Codesmith’s guidance. Real quick, why don’t we check some of Michael’s own students from his bootcamp company, Formation?</p>



<p>There’s tons of students on his site. Some of them get featured heavily, like here:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Formation-Dev-Carlitos-Willis-Feature.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="702" height="1024" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Formation-Dev-Carlitos-Willis-Feature-702x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Formation-Dev-Carlitos-Willis-Feature-702x1024.png 702w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Formation-Dev-Carlitos-Willis-Feature-206x300.png 206w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Formation-Dev-Carlitos-Willis-Feature-768x1120.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Formation-Dev-Carlitos-Willis-Feature-1053x1536.png 1053w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Formation-Dev-Carlitos-Willis-Feature.png 1316w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px"></a></figure>



<p>Here’s Carlitos’ LinkedIn:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Carlitos-Willis-LinkedIn.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="807" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Carlitos-Willis-LinkedIn-1024x807.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Carlitos-Willis-LinkedIn-1024x807.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Carlitos-Willis-LinkedIn-300x236.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Carlitos-Willis-LinkedIn-768x605.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Carlitos-Willis-LinkedIn-1536x1211.png 1536w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Carlitos-Willis-LinkedIn.png 1644w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Carlitos is listing his time at Michael’s bootcamp/training company in his experience section. The exact same thing that Michael RAILS on Codesmith for.</p>



<p>To be clear: I don’t think there’s anything wrong with this. Carlitos, all the Codesmith students, or ANY student from ANY bootcamp have done nothing wrong by putting stuff like this on their resumes. If Formation students list their time like this, I don’t see anything wrong with that either.</p>



<p>In the thousands of resumes I’ve reviewed, I’ve never had any trouble differentiating between full-time roles, part-time, freelance, training, or any other random item on a resume. Any hiring manager will sniff this stuff from a mile away. No one is fooling anyone.</p>



<p>But Michael has now turned this into a story of fraud facilitated by Codesmith. And here I am writing hundreds of words about this nonsense. There’s nothing here beyond what Michael has conjured into the ether of Reddit.</p>



<p>You might disagree with some of the guidance that Codesmith gives its graduates but no one is doing anything wrong. It sure as fuck aint fraud.</p>



<p>And that’s what Michael is so damn good at, turning innocuous little things into grand conspiracies that take hours of research to untangle.</p>



<h2>Michael Novati’s Nonstop Attack Campaign Against Codesmith</h2>



<p>Think I’m cherry picking examples of Michael’s posts?</p>



<p>Let’s zoom out.</p>



<p>My team and I looked at every Reddit post and comment made by Michael Novati over the past 3 months.</p>



<p>We then catalogued the posts that mentioned Codesmith or were referencing Codesmith based on context. Next we categorized those posts based on if the sentiment was positive, neutral, or negative towards Codesmith.</p>



<p>Here’s all the days that had negative comments along with their frequency over the past few months:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Last-3-Months.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="939" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Last-3-Months-1024x939.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Last-3-Months-1024x939.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Last-3-Months-300x275.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Last-3-Months-768x704.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Last-3-Months.png 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Fucking relentless.</p>



<p>It’s easier to highlight days where Michael DOESN’T talk about Codesmith. Dude, get a fucking hobby.</p>



<p>What if the past few months don’t adequately reflect Michael’s posting history? What if recent events have just been a negative phase of the bootcamp space? Can we really make any claims using just the last few months?</p>



<p>Fine, let’s go further.</p>



<p>I went to my team and said “fuck it, let’s go back as far as possible.” So we went through all of Michael’s posts since June 2024. That’s when Reddit stops making it easy to pull up comments. Yes, we looked at every post and comment from over a year. No fast and dirty AI analysis here, we did it by hand.</p>



<p>Here’s the timeline of negative posts and comments since June 2024:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Annual.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="878" height="1024" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Annual-878x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Annual-878x1024.png 878w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Annual-257x300.png 257w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Annual-768x896.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Annual.png 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 878px) 100vw, 878px"></a></figure>



<p>What. The. Fuck.</p>



<p>Who has the time for this?</p>



<p>In order to adequately show how often Michael posts negative comments about Codesmith, we had to use HABIT TRACKER VISUALIZATIONS.</p>



<p>It’s relentless, it’s nonstop, and in my opinion, completely unhinged. At least Michael slows down a tad during the holidays. Otherwise, he’s all gas, no breaks.</p>



<p>Well, alright, MAYBE Michael was posting in such absurd volume that the positive mentions outweigh the negative? Maybe I’m selectively pulling data?</p>



<p>NOPE.</p>



<p>The comments about Codesmith are severely overweighted on the negative side. In aggregate, here’s how the sentiment breaks down:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Sentiment.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Sentiment-1024x683.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Sentiment-1024x683.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Sentiment-300x200.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Sentiment-768x512.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Michael-Novati-Codesmith-Mentions_Sentiment.png 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Is it just me or is there a weeeee bit of bias in this posting?</p>



<p>Yes, yes, there fucking is.</p>



<p>Alright, fine, MAYBE all this negative attention is deserved. Maybe Codesmith is the villain that Michael claims. Let’s find out.</p>



<h2>Other Bootcamp Competitors Hold Codesmith in High Regard</h2>



<p>I interviewed 10 different folks. Including students, multiple Codesmith employees from the leadership team, and founders of competing coding bootcamps. I dug through countless docs, many of them internal, and probably annoyed some of these folks with my endless requests for screenshots to verify stories.</p>



<p>Overall, I found everyone at Codesmith to be:</p>



<ul>
<li>Extremely responsive and on top of their shit. They made promises and kept them.</li>



<li>Transparent to an absurd degree.</li>



<li>Humble, honest, and self-aware.</li>



<li>A desire to do the right thing even at their detriment. These folks don’t know how to play offense, they assume good intent from everyone.</li>
</ul>



<p>In short, these are good folks. Faultless? Of course not, everyone makes mistakes.</p>



<p>But I do believe that the world is better with Codesmith in it.</p>



<p>Which makes this whole situation all the more tragic.</p>



<p>Michael isn’t waging some war against another competitor hellbent on profit-seeking. These are folks that are helping people transition their careers. They are quite literally helping people change their lives. And they’re doing it for the right reasons in my opinion.</p>



<p>Don’t take my word for it.</p>



<p>I spoke with Anthony Hughes, a co-founder of <a href="https://www.techelevator.com/">Tech Elevator</a>, another bootcamp. Here’s what he had to say about Codesmith: “The folks at Codesmith were competitors of Tech Elevator. Especially as everyone went online, we competed directly. I never minded losing to Codesmith. Either choice by students was a good one, both our programs vetted students heavily and would get students great outcomes. If we ever lost to Codesmith, we could accept that because we knew the student would get the outcome they wanted. Not like the lower-quality major programs.”</p>



<p>I also heard the same from Kush Patel, a co-founder and former CEO of <a href="https://www.appacademy.io/">AppAcademy</a> “Codesmith is one of the best players in the space. They run their programs in a way that we benchmarked against. There are plenty of other schools that are questionable and are not getting any scrutiny from Michael.”</p>



<p>We have two co-founders of competing bootcamps saying that Codesmith is <em>one of the good ones</em>. Are there shady bootcamps out there? Absolutely. But Codesmith isn’t one of them.</p>



<h2>The Tactics Michael Uses to Wage His PR Nightmare Campaign</h2>



<p>After reading hundreds of Michael’s posts, a few patterns emerge on how he attacks Codesmith.</p>



<p>To be honest, it’s a masterclass on how to gut your opponent via PR. If every move is intentional by Michael, I gotta hand it to him becasue he’s exceptionally good at this.</p>



<p>Here are the most prominent tactics I saw:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Relentless volume.</strong> It’s not enough to post a few days. If you want to destroy someone’s reputation, you gotta hammer the shit outta that drum. Over a 487 day period, we counted 425 negative posts on Codesmith. That’s an average of 0.87 negative posts per day. A negative post almost every fucking day.</li>



<li><strong>Reference multiple conspiracies at the same time.</strong> If you only mention one conspiracy, folks have a straightforward path to getting to the truth. But if you mention 3-4 at the same time? Only the true masochistics like myself will even attempt to pull it apart.</li>



<li><strong>Rarely, if ever, state your full accusation.</strong> For any single conspiracy, always allude to it. Don’t make a full, comprehensive case that allows someone to see the full picture. Let your audience sit with the uncertainty. You don’t need to win the argument, you only need to sow doubt and fear.</li>



<li><strong>Cherry-pick data.</strong> As the saying goes: “there are lies, damned lies, and statistics.” For any industry data you can get your hands on, find the slice that skews the narrative in your favor. Don’t worry about anyone fact-checking, they never do.</li>



<li><strong>Attack every misstep, no matter how obscure.</strong> Sooner or later, your victim will make mistakes. When they do, attack. No matter how small or obscure, blow it up into a major drama. Hype, distort, and magnify.</li>



<li><strong>Take down third-party arbitrators.</strong> If your industry has some sort of credential, certification, or regulator, attack that body just as much as your competitor. If your competitor has optimized for this transparency, you’ll turn their strength into a weakness. Even better, accuse both parties of conspiring together.</li>



<li><strong>Blame the victim.</strong> Whenever someone mentions that you’re going too hard, say that your competitor is forcing your hand. “You’d love to move on! You don’t want to spend your time on all this! If ONLY your competitor would do the right thing, then all this would stop!” But we all know it’ll never stop.</li>



<li><strong>Delete comments and posts.</strong> Delete comments and posts to skew the narrative in your favor. You don’t need to delete everything, just enough to make the conversation messy and difficult to follow. And a few key deletions tilts the scales in your favor.</li>



<li><strong>Make your claims squishy.</strong> Don’t ever say your competitor is a cult or committing fraud. Say that things look like it, or remind you of it. You’ll have deniability while the association still gets planted in the minds of your audience.</li>
</ul>



<p>A sign of the times.</p>



<h2>The Impact on Codesmith</h2>



<p>Has all this had a material impact on Codesmith?</p>



<p>I spoke to both Will Sentence (former CEO and co-founder) and Alina Vasile (the current CEO). When I asked them how much revenue has declined at Codesmith since their peak, they both told me about 80%.</p>



<p>Then I asked how much of that was due to everything on Reddit. They said about half of the decline, so a 40% drop came from the negative PR on Reddit. And the other 40% is from a slowdown in the bootcamp market.</p>



<p>Will told me that Codesmith reached a high of $23.5M in revenue. A 40% hit from Reddit means a revenue drop of $9.4M.</p>



<p>What about the emotional toll?</p>



<p>I asked Will Sentance how it all impacted him “It made me doubt how I can start anything after. Michael Novati is still going at it by commenting on my fellowship at Oxford. And Reddit is so visible in Google – at a meeting last week in the UK, the person used ChatGPT to look up Codesmith and it referenced all those Reddit posts. I have genuine caution about launching new stuff.”</p>



<p>Even after leaving Codesmith, the Reddit harassment still impacts Will.</p>



<p>Students also feel deeply uncomfortable with Michael’s actions.</p>



<p>I spoke with a former employee from Codesmith who told me “I was a teacher at Codesmith and the primary reason for moving away from teaching was MIchael Novati. I signed up to help a team of great people help people achieve their goals like I did, I didn’t sign up to be targeted and attacked by a Reddit troll. It took a toll on my mental health and I decided to step back to focus on my day job at Microsoft.”</p>



<p>Here’s another instance of a student calling Michael out on LinkedIn:</p>

<p>And another student that reached out to Will Sentence:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FCNY-Student-Doubts-from-Michael-Redacted-1-scaled.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="604" height="2560" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FCNY-Student-Doubts-from-Michael-Redacted-1-scaled.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FCNY-Student-Doubts-from-Michael-Redacted-1-scaled.png 604w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FCNY-Student-Doubts-from-Michael-Redacted-1-71x300.png 71w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FCNY-Student-Doubts-from-Michael-Redacted-1-483x2048.png 483w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px"></a></figure>



<p>My sources also told me:</p>



<ul>
<li>An executive was threatened after moving to another company, accusations were going to be raised over IP conflicts. These accusations appear meritless and ridiculous to me.</li>



<li>The morale at Codesmith has sharply declined.</li>



<li>Some employees have had mental health difficulties, some left Codesmith.</li>



<li>One contractor ended their working relationship with Codesmith because of a fear of being dragged into all this.</li>



<li>An employee was doxxed after posting in the /r/codingbootcamp subreddit.</li>



<li>Prospective students have pulled applications.</li>



<li>Students that had amazing outcomes are afraid to post about their experiences.</li>



<li>After graduating, some students began questioning their own experience and considered going back to their old careers.</li>
</ul>



<p>As much as I wanted to detail these stories, I had a lot of requests from sources to remain anonymous. Even when folks went through some heinous shit from all this, they specifically requested not to be included.</p>



<p>It is difficult to understate the impact that Michael’s actions have had on Codesmith.</p>



<h2>Is Michael Novati Breaking the Moderator Code of Conduct on Reddit?</h2>



<p>I think so. But it’s not my call.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://redditinc.com/policies/moderator-code-of-conduct">Reddit Moderator Code of Conduct</a> says this:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reddit-Moderator-Code-of-Conduct-Integrity.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="469" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reddit-Moderator-Code-of-Conduct-Integrity-1024x469.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reddit-Moderator-Code-of-Conduct-Integrity-1024x469.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reddit-Moderator-Code-of-Conduct-Integrity-300x137.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reddit-Moderator-Code-of-Conduct-Integrity-768x352.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reddit-Moderator-Code-of-Conduct-Integrity.png 1376w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>So what counts as compensation?</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reddit-Moderator-Code-of-Conduct-Compensation.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="784" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reddit-Moderator-Code-of-Conduct-Compensation-1024x784.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reddit-Moderator-Code-of-Conduct-Compensation-1024x784.png 1024w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reddit-Moderator-Code-of-Conduct-Compensation-300x230.png 300w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reddit-Moderator-Code-of-Conduct-Compensation-768x588.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Reddit-Moderator-Code-of-Conduct-Compensation.png 1364w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Basically, Reddit Moderators can’t receive compensation for doing basic moderator tasks. Good rule, the point is to prevent companies and third-parties from paying Reddit mods off.</p>



<p>Now here’s the tricky part.</p>



<p>What if that Reddit Moderator is a co-founder of a competitor? What if they spend YEARS shit talking you and destroying your reputation? What if they’re not technically receiving new stock but the value in their startup equity goes up after they destroy you on Reddit? Doesn’t that count as financial compensation and a violation of Reddit’s own rule to “Moderate with Integrity”?</p>



<p>I believe it does.</p>



<p>And I believe that’s why Michael is doing what he’s doing. He wins when Codesmith loses.</p>



<p>Shit like this is why Reddit has become extremely untrustworthy.</p>



<h2>What Drives the Crazy Student Outcomes at Codesmith</h2>



<p>If you dig around, you will find stories from Codesmith students and placement data that seem <em>too</em> good to be true. Is Codesmith actually that good?</p>



<p>As far as I can tell, it’s all real.</p>



<p>So how has Codesmith managed it? I found two forces that have driven these outcomes.</p>



<h3>1. Codesmith Has an Intense Application Process</h3>



<p>Not just anyone can join Codesmith. They screen folks OUT of their program. If you’re a line cook, kinda think a software engineer job sounds fun, have never spent even 5 minutes figuring out what that looks like, and apply, you won’t get in.</p>



<p>Codesmith only accepts folks that they think have a good chance of succeeding.</p>



<p>They filter the front of their student pipeline which keeps the outcome rates really high on the backend. That’s how they get their placement numbers as high as they are. That’s the “trick” to juicing the student outcomes.</p>



<p>Now, if you have some software engineering experience, you’ll likely find the application to be absurdly easy. That’s the point.</p>



<p>To me, Codesmith isn’t a true zero to one program. The students that thrive have already put a lot of self-study hours into their career transition. They’re motivated, have learned the basics, and are ready to dial up the intensity. These are folks that are also likely to succeed during the job application process after they graduate.</p>



<p>This is also one of the easiest ways to spot the shitty bootcamps. If they take anyone and everyone, that’s an enormous red flag. Stay away.</p>



<h3>2. The Hiring Market Was Extremely Strong from 2019-2022</h3>



<p>I spoke to one student that went through Codesmith in 2020, they reported that every single one of the folks in their cohort landed a software engineering job within about 6 months. That’s nuts.</p>



<p>Another graduate from the 2019 era told me that 80-90% of the students from their cohort, the cohort before, and the cohort after, landed software engineering jobs within a few months of graduating.</p>



<p>How were the placements that high? I believe the Codesmith program had something to do with it. But that was also a period where the tech market was exceptionally hot. Across all levels and functions, it was much easier to switch jobs, get promotions, and change careers in tech. I saw that myself.</p>



<p>I’ve also personally seen things tighten a lot in the past few years.</p>



<p>How do Codesmiths placement rates look now?</p>



<p>Even if we look at more recent cohorts, the placements are still pretty damn strong for the full-time program:</p>



<figure><a href="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/CIRR-Codesmith-2023-2024-Outcomes.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="998" height="1024" src="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/CIRR-Codesmith-2023-2024-Outcomes-998x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/CIRR-Codesmith-2023-2024-Outcomes-998x1024.png 998w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/CIRR-Codesmith-2023-2024-Outcomes-292x300.png 292w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/CIRR-Codesmith-2023-2024-Outcomes-768x788.png 768w, https://larslofgren.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/CIRR-Codesmith-2023-2024-Outcomes.png 1384w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 998px) 100vw, 998px"></a></figure>



<p>That’s <a href="https://www.cirr.org/schooldata">one of the reports issued by CIRR on Codesmith</a>. It’s the full report so I’m not cherry picking.</p>



<p>Even during 2023-2024, a pretty shitty period to try to start a career as a software engineer, 70% of folks are still landing in-field jobs within a year of graduating Codesmith. With a median salary of $110,000. Even if you only count full-time employment, it’s still 62%.  I personally think that’s remarkable.</p>



<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/19z0FzVPHJ5qJLZ2T4Q_1EHaKo64TJpxm/view">The part-time program is only slightly worse at 60%</a>.</p>



<p>Again, this is during a hiring market when entry-level software engineering jobs are brutally hard to get. And the placement rates are still in the 60-70% range.</p>



<p>I’m also hearing that students have to work a lot harder now to land that job. And it can take a solid year. That’s that state of tech hiring at the moment.</p>



<p>So if you see old placement data of 80-100%, that was when the market was hot. Now it’s come back down to earth which is to be expected.</p>



<h2>The Future of Codesmith</h2>



<p>To me the future of Codesmith looks quite bright. Alina (the CEO) is very much in control, the team is excited about the future, and the student outcomes still look impressive to me. I’ve been told that there are no plans at Codesmith to shut down.</p>



<p>Especially with all the changes to software development from AI, there’s a lot of training that everyone is going to have to go through in tech. Good time to be in the education space.</p>



<p>If Michael could take his boot off Codesmith’s throat for just half a minute, they’d do a lot of good for a lot people.</p>



<h2>My Recommendations for Anyone Considering Joining a Developer Bootcamp</h2>



<p>I cannot tell you which bootcamp to attend. Or whether a bootcamp is worth it at all.</p>



<p>I’ve hired well over a hundred folks in my career, interviewed countless others. Including engineers and data scientists.</p>



<p>At no point did I ever place any value in a bootcamp. I also never considered it a detractor. It’s neutral to me, never really signaling anything. Neither good nor bad.</p>



<p>If you think it’ll get you your first job (which is all that really matters), and the price/time makes sense for you, go for it. But there are plenty of other paths. It’s not required by any means. I know plenty of self-taught devs that have worked at prestigious startups and big tech.</p>



<p>As for which bootcamp, that’s also up to you.</p>



<p>What I can say is this.</p>



<p>As I’ve gone through Michael Novati’s Reddit account, I’ve been appalled. I’ve never seen anything like this in my entire career. And I’ve played in some fucked up corners of the internet. That last thing I’d EVER want is to have my name or career associated with anything that Michael Novati has touched. That includes his startup, Formation.</p>



<p>You’ll have to make your own choice. But I know what mine would be.</p>



<p>At the very least, when doing research on bootcamps, I would consider anything on r/codingbootcamp/ to be completely contaminated. Whatever the real truth is, that subreddit is Michael’s personal fiefdom. He can do and say whatever he wants. And he has one helluva conflict of interest: he’s a co-founder and CTO of a leading bootcamp (even if he tries to claim that he doesn’t run a bootcamp).</p>



<p>If I was looking for unbiased reviews, I’d only factor in content from a community that Michael (or any other bootcamp founder) did not control. Make sure you know who your subreddit Mods are.</p>



<h2>Every Company is Now Vulnerable to These Types of Reputation Attacks</h2>



<p>For me, the craziest part of this story is that it’s not an edge case.</p>



<p>Anyone can use this exact same method to tear down their competitors.</p>



<p>You only need to complete one step: become a Reddit mod in one of the main subreddits for your industry. If you do that and the original mods of the subreddit don’t care what you do, you can completely fuck up your whole industry. Sow lies, fear, and misery at will.</p>



<p>Which means <em>anyone can do this to you</em>.</p>



<p>Reddit has become THE reputation attack vector.</p>



<p>And since Reddit is considered the default source of all human knowledge now, Reddit threads pop to the top of Google. Anyone searching for your brand will stumble into this madness. LLMs also prioritize Reddit so that narrative gets corrupted too. Getting control of one channel allows you to corrupt three major channels all at once. Most people don’t check receipts, they don’t dig for truth, they accept what’s put in front of them.</p>



<p>Reddit mods now control our search information ecosystem. Unpaid, corruptible Reddit mods.</p>



<p>I know there are good Reddit mods out there. But all it takes is one to fuck up your own business.</p>

    <article>
      <h3>Claim: “Portland is burning to the ground.”</h3>
      <p>Reality: Today’s protests near the ICE facility in South Waterfront remained constrained to a few blocks. Fire services report no large fires or elevated call volume.</p>

    <!-- Claim 2 -->
    <article>
      <h3>Claim: The judge was “his judge” and should have ruled differently.</h3>
      <p>Reality: Judge Karin Immergut — a Trump appointee — issued the original orders blocking deployment. Today, a Ninth Circuit panel partially stayed her ruling so that Oregon’s Guard can stay federalized, but it <b>did not</b> permit deployment to Portland.</p>
      
    </article>

    <!-- Claim 3 -->
    <article>
      <h3>Claim: Title 10 allows federal troop deployment here as used.</h3>
      <p>Reality: The Ninth Circuit’s stay lifts only the block on federalizing Oregon’s Guard, **not** on deploying any Guard units to Portland. The broader restraining order barring deployments from any state remains in force.</p>
      
    </article>

    <!-- Claim 4 -->
    <article>
      <h3>Claim: California Guard can still be sent into Portland.</h3>
      <p>Reality: The order preventing deployment of any state’s Guard into Portland is still active. California’s troops cannot legally enter under current rulings.</p>

<p>We know. Our Twitter got owned. We knew within moments of it happening. We know exactly how it happened. Nothing was at risk other than our Twitter account (and one Fly.io employee’s self-esteem).  Also: for fuck’s sake.</p>

<p>Here’s what happened: Kurt Mackey, our intrepid CEO, got phished.</p>
<p>Had this been an impactful attack, we would not be this flippant about it. For this, though, any other tone on our part would be false.</p><h2 id="how-they-got-kurt"><a href="#how-they-got-kurt" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>How They Got Kurt</span></h2>
<p>Two reasons: one, it was a pretty good phishing attack, and two, Twitter fell outside the “things we take seriously” boundary.</p>

<p>The phishing attack was effective because it exploited a deep psychological vulnerability in our management team: we are old and out of touch with the youths of today.</p>

<p>For many months now, we’ve had an contractor/intern-type-person Boosting Our Brand on Twitter by posting dank developer memes (I think that’s what they’re called). The thing about this dankery is that we don’t really understand it. I mean, hold on, we know what the memes mean technically. We just don’t get why they’re funny.</p>

<p>However, in pushing back on them, we’re up against two powerful forces:</p>

<ol>
<li>The dank memes appear to perform better than the stuff we ourselves write on Twitter.
</li><li>We are reliably informed by our zoomer children that we are too cringe to be trusted on these matters.
</li></ol>

<p>Here’s the phish Kurt got:</p>

<p><img alt="A pretty-plausible Twitter alert" src="https://fly.io/blog/kurt-got-got/assets/phish.png?2/3&amp;center"></p>

<p>Diabolical. Like a scalpel expertly wielded against Kurt’s deepest <a href="https://theonion.com/cool-dad-raising-daughter-on-media-that-will-put-her-en-1819572981/" title="">middle-aged-dude</a> insecurity. Our ruthless attackers clinically designed this email to trigger an autonomic Kurt response: “oh, what the fuck is this, and why did we post it?”</p>
<p>ATO is cool-kid for “got owned”</p>
<p>I’m getting a little ahead of the story here. We knew our X.com account had suffered an ATO because a bunch of us simultaneously got another email saying that the <a href="https://twitter.com/flydotio" title="">@flydotio</a> account’s email address now pointed to <code>achilles19969@gmail.com</code>. Our immediate response was to audit all accesses to the login information in <a href="https://1password.com/" title="">1Password</a>, to cut all access for anybody who’d recently pulled it; your worst-case assumption in a situation like this is that someone’s endpoint has been owned up.</p>

<p>Fortunately, nobody lost access for very long. I called Kurt to let him know why he was being locked out, and 5 seconds later, he’d <a href="https://archive.is/6rVqf" title="">realized what had happened.</a> <strong>Don’t click anything there.</strong></p>
<h2 id="why-it-worked"><a href="#why-it-worked" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>Why It Worked</span></h2>
<p>That’s the right question to ask, isn’t it? How could this have been possible in the first place?</p>

<p>Contrary to one popular opinion, you don’t defeat phishing by training people not to click on things. I mean, tell them not to, sure! But eventually, under continued pressure, everybody clicks. <a href="https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~grantho/papers/oakland2025_phishing-training.pdf" title="">There’s science on this</a>. The cool kids haven’t done phishing simulation training in years.</p>

<p>What you’re supposed to do instead is use phishing-resistant authentication. This is almost the whole backstory for <a href="https://www.imperialviolet.org/tourofwebauthn/tourofwebauthn.html" title="">U2F,  FIDO2</a> and <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102195" title="">Passkeys</a>.</p>

<p>Phishing-resistant authentication works by mutual authentication (or, if you’re a stickler, by origin- and channel-binding). Phishes are malicious proxies for credentials. Modern MFA schemes like FIDO2 break that proxy flow; your browser won’t send real credentials to the fake site.</p>
<p>there’s more to it than this, but, broad strokes.</p>
<p>This is, in fact, how all of our infrastructure is secured at Fly.io; specifically, we get <a href="https://fly.io/blog/soc2-the-screenshots-will-continue-until-security-improves/#what-soc2-made-us-do" title="">everything behind an IdP</a> (in our case: Google’s) and have it require phishing-proof MFA. You’re unlikely to phish your way to viewing logs here, or to refunding a customer bill at Stripe, or to viewing infra metrics, because all these things require an SSO login through Google.</p>

<p>Twitter, on the other hand. Yeah, so, about that. You may have heard that, a few years back, there were some goings-on involving Twitter. Many of us at Fly.io <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@flydotio" title="">decamped for Mastodon</a>, and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:j7herf6n4xiig2yg7fqdmkci" title="">later to Bluesky.</a> There was a window of time in 2023-2024 where it looked as if Twitter might not be a long term thing for us at all.</p>
<p>† (to whom I sincerely apologize for having assumed they had been owned up and were the proximate cause of the hack)</p>
<p>As a result, Twitter had been a sort of legacy shared account for us, with credentials managed in 1Password and shared with our zoomer contractor†.</p>

<p>Which is why Kurt was in a position to pull credentials from 1Password and log in to members-x.com in response to an email from alerts-x.com.</p>
<p>Still: we could have dodged this attack with hygiene: Kurt complains that “x.com” is an extremely phishable domain, and, sure, but also: the 1Password browser plugin would have noticed that “members-x.com” wasn’t an “x.com” host.</p><h2 id="what-took-so-long"><a href="#what-took-so-long" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>What Took So Long</span></h2>
<p>The attacker immediately revoked all tokens and set up new 2FA, so while we were quickly able to reset our password, we couldn’t lock them out of our account without an intervention from X.com, which took something like 1 5 hours to set up.</p>

<p>(That’s not a knock on X.com; 15 hours for a 2FA reset isn’t outside industry norms).</p>

<p>We’re obviously making a lot of noise about this now, but we were pretty quiet during the incident itself (beyond just “We know. We knew 45 seconds after it happened. We know exactly how it happened. It’s just a Twitter thing.”)</p>

<p>That’s because, in the grand scheme of things, the attack was pretty chill: <a href="https://archive.is/PTO2M" title="">a not-very-plausible crypto scam</a> that presumably generated $0 for the attackers, 15+ hours of <code>brand damage</code>, and extra security engineering cycles burnt on watchful waiting. Our users weren’t under attack, and the account wasn’t being used to further intercept customer accounts. At one point, the attackers apparently deleted our whole Twitter history, which, like, don’t threaten us with a good time. So we let it roll, until we got our account recovered the next morning.</p>
<h2 id="the-moral-of-the-story-is"><a href="#the-moral-of-the-story-is" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>The Moral Of The Story Is</span></h2><p>“Really the biggest takeaway for me is that Kurt reads his email.”</p>
<p>Obviously Kurt loses his commit access. The time comes in the life of every CEO, and now it comes for him. </p>

<p>Also, we’ll finally have a population sample for “incident response” in <a href="https://fly.io/blog/soc2-the-screenshots-will-continue-until-security-improves/" title="">our next SOC2</a>.</p>

<p>Maybe we’ll post more on Twitter. Or maybe we’ll double down on Zoomer memes. I don’t know. Social media is really weird right now. Either way: our Twitter access is Passkeys now.</p>
<p>seriously don’t click anything on that page</p>
<p>If you were inclined to take us up on an “airdrop” to “claim a share” of the “token” powering Fly.io, the site is <a href="https://archive.is/PTO2M" title="">still up</a>. You can connect your wallet it it! You’ll lose all your money. But if we’d actually done an ICO, you’d have lost all your money anyways.</p>

<p>Somebody involved in pulling this attack off had to come up with “own a piece of the sky!”, and I think that’s punishment enough for them.</p>

<p>Whatever you’re operating that isn’t behind phishing-resistant MFA, or, better yet, an SSO IdP that requires phishing-resistant MFA: that thing is eventually going to get phished. Dance around the clown-fire of our misfortune if you must, but let us be a lesson to you as well.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you search online, you’ll find countless benchmarks claiming to compare the
performance of various JavaScript frameworks with each other. More often than
not, the benchmarks are overly simplistic and fail to reflect real-world
scenarios. In other cases, they compare apples and oranges, for instance by
pitting a fully fledged framework against a lightweight library that cover only
a small subset of the framework’s functionality.</p>
<p>Right now, I’m at that point in my career again where I am starting development
on a new web application and need to choose the “right” JavaScript framework.
This time, I decided to look for academic studies on the performance of
JavaScript frameworks and sadly, didn’t find as many as I had hoped. I did come
across one particular study that compares Angular, React, Vue, Svelte and Blazor
with each other. Its main drawback is that the comparison was done in 2021 – a
lifetime ago in tech terms – but I think it’s still worth reading.</p>
<p>Before I dive into the summary, I want to share something I found mildly amusing.
The paper is published in the Journal of Web Engineering, and if you visit its
website, you’ll notice it includes <code>/index.php/</code> in the URL. I’m not sure why.
Is it a deliberate choice? Or is it a sign of questionable web engineering?</p>

<p>It is estimated that up to 97% of websites today use JavaScript, with more than
80% also relying on a library or framework. JavaScript is often used to manage
UI state changes within single page applications, allowing users to interact
without reloading the entire page. While this can be done manually via the DOM
API, it’s often error prone.</p>
<div><h2 id="theory">Theory</h2><p><span><a href="#theory" title="Copy link to heading" tabindex="-1"> <img src="https://chuniversiteit.nl/images/static/link.svg" alt="Link"></a></span></p></div>
<p>Modern web frameworks wrap the DOM API and provide a custom declarative syntax.
This means that application code can simply describe the desired UI state, and
the framework automatically generates the necessary DOM API calls to reflect
that state in the browser.</p>
<p>When using the DOM API directly, the amount of script execution required to
update the UI scales linearly with the complexity of the change. However, when
DOM API calls are generated dynamically by a framework, the framework must first
determine exactly which updates are necessary, introducing additional overhead.
Furthermore, the chosen rendering strategy can greatly affect the number of DOM
API calls made. A bad strategy may result in noticeable delays even for small
updates, which is why it makes sense to compare the strategies used by major
JavaScript frameworks.</p>
<div><h3 id="javascript-versus-webassembly">JavaScript versus WebAssembly</h3><p><span><a href="#javascript-versus-webassembly" title="Copy link to heading" tabindex="-1"> <img src="https://chuniversiteit.nl/images/static/link.svg" alt="Link"></a></span></p></div>
<p>The study looks at five popular frameworks: Angular, React, Vue, Svelte, and
Blazor. All are JavaScript-based except for Blazor, which uses WebAssembly.
Blazor applications are written in C# and run in a .NET runtime compiled to
WebAssembly. Because WebAssembly modules lack direct access to the DOM, they
rely on an additional JavaScript interoperability layer, which can introduce
extra overhead.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Framework</th>
<th>Version</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Angular</td>
<td>11.2.3</td></tr><tr><td>React</td>

<div><h3 id="virtual-dom-versus-data-bindings">Virtual DOM versus data bindings</h3><p><span><a href="#virtual-dom-versus-data-bindings" title="Copy link to heading" tabindex="-1"> <img src="https://chuniversiteit.nl/images/static/link.svg" alt="Link"></a></span></p></div>
<p>All five frameworks follow some variant of the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)
pattern. In MVVM, developers define components that bind an application’s data
sources to views, so that changes in the data are automatically reflected in the
UI.</p>
<p>Each framework continuously tries to keep the state of the DOM tree synchronised
with the state of the component tree defined in application code. This is done
using two distinct methods.</p>
<p>The first method, known as virtual DOM (vDOM)-based rendering, is used in React,
Vue, and Blazor. It works by comparing the two trees and calculating the minimum
set of changes needed to transform one into the other. This generally has a time
complexity of <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>O</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msup><mi>n</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">O(n^3)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>, but can often be simplified to <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>O</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">O(n)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> by making
assumptions that usually apply in browser applications.</p>
<p>The second method is used by Angular and Svelte. Here, there is no separate step
for calculating all required changes to the DOM. Instead, each component
directly updates its corresponding section of the DOM by tracking the values of
its data bindings.</p>
<p>From a performance standpoint, using a virtual DOM can introduce overhead not
present in a binding-based rendering strategy.</p>
<div><h3 id="creating-versus-updating">Creating versus updating</h3><p><span><a href="#creating-versus-updating" title="Copy link to heading" tabindex="-1"> <img src="https://chuniversiteit.nl/images/static/link.svg" alt="Link"></a></span></p></div>
<p>All of the reviewed frameworks perform DOM updates within a render loop that
walks through the component tree. The cost of this render loop depends on the
size of the input and fixed costs.</p>
<p>A render loop involves two types of work: creating new elements and updating
existing ones. Creating elements is generally straightforward and costs the same
for each framework, regardless of rendering strategy.</p>
<p>Updating existing elements is where the rendering strategy makes a noticeable
difference. Angular, for example, always walks through the entire component tree,
resulting in a lot of unnecessary work when only a small part of the tree needs
updating. React and Blazor walk only through the subtree of the component that
initiates the render loop, which is usually more efficient but may still require
some unnecessary work for descendants whose output has not changed. Vue and
Svelte, on the other hand, process only “dirty” components whose output has
changed. This requires the framework to track which components are dirty. Vue
does this at runtime, Svelte handles it at compile time.</p>
<p>Finally, component output can be classified as either static or dynamic content,
with static content remaining unchanged after the component’s initial render.
Frameworks that can optimise for static content may have a performance advantage
over those that cannot.</p>

<p>Several benchmarks were conducted using Angular, React, Vue, Svelte and Blazor.
The authors found significant differences in performance between the frameworks,
especially as input size increased.
<label><span>Svelte emerges as the clear winner</span><span> (side note: </span><span>For the record, I have never used

is generally among the slowest:</p>

<p>Overall, the results are in line with what would be expected given the
characteristics of each rendering strategy.</p>
<p>The WebAssembly-based Blazor shows significantly worse performance than its
JavaScript-based competitors. However, from these benchmarks alone it’s
impossible to determine whether this is due to Blazor itself or a fundamental
limitation of using WebAssembly for this purpose.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Svelte demonstrates three key characteristics that likely contribute
most to improved performance:</p>
<ul>
<li>The use of a reactivity system to automatically detect dirty components</li>
<li>An optimising compiler that generates component update code which ignores
static content</li>
<li>A binding-based rendering approach rather than a virtual DOM</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="new_--trim_feature"><a href="#new_--trim_feature">New <code>--trim</code> feature</a></h2>
<p><em>Jeff Bezanson</em>, <em>Cody Tapscott</em>, <em>Gabriel Baraldi</em></p>
<p><code>julia</code> now has a new experimental<code>--trim</code> feature, when compiling a system image with this mode julia will trim statically unreachable code leading to significantly better compile times and binary sizes. To use it you also need to pass the <code>--experimental</code> flag when building the system image. </p>
<p>In order to use it, any code that is reachable from the entrypoints must not have any dynamic dispatches otherwise the trimming will be unsafe and it will error during compilation.</p>
<p>The expected way of using it is via the <code>JuliaC.jl</code> package, which provides a CLI and a programmatic API. </p>
<p>For example a simple package with an <code>@main</code> function:</p>
<pre><code><span>module</span> AppProject

<span>function</span> <span>@main</span>(<span>ARGS</span>)
    println(Core.<span>stdout</span>, <span>"Hello World!"</span>)
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>end</span></code></pre>
<pre><code>juliac --output-exe app_test_exe --bundle build --trim=safe --experimental ./AppProject</code></pre>
<pre><code>./build/bin/app_test_exe
Hello World!

<span>ls</span> -lh build/bin/app_test_exe
-rwxr-xr-x@ 1 gabrielbaraldi  staff   1.1M Oct  6 17:22 ./build/bin/app_test_exe*</code></pre>
<h2 id="redefinition_of_constants_structs"><a href="#redefinition_of_constants_structs">Redefinition of constants (structs)</a></h2>
<p><em>Keno Fischer</em>, <em>Tim Holy</em></p>
<p>Bindings now participate in the "world age" mechanism previously used for methods. This has the effect that constants and structs can be properly redefined. As an example:</p>
<pre><code><span># Define a struct and a method on that struct:</span>
julia&gt; <span>struct</span> Foo
          a::<span>Int</span>
       <span>end</span>

julia&gt; g(f::Foo) = f.a^<span>2</span>
g (generic <span>function</span> with <span>1</span> method)

julia&gt; g(Foo(<span>2</span>))
<span>4</span>

<span># Redefine the struct (julia pre-1.12 would error here)</span>
julia&gt; <span>struct</span> Foo
          a::<span>Int</span>
          b::<span>Int</span>
       <span>end</span>

<span># Note that functions need to be redefined to work on the new `Foo`</span>
julia&gt; g(Foo(<span>1</span>,<span>2</span>))
ERROR: <span>MethodError</span>: no method matching g(::Foo)
The <span>function</span> <span>`g`</span> exists, but no method is defined <span>for</span> this combination of argument types.

Closest candidates are:
  g(::<span>@world</span>(Foo, <span>39296</span>:<span>39300</span>)) <span># &lt;- This is syntax for accessing the binding in an older "world"</span>
   @ Main REPL[<span>2</span>]:<span>1</span>

julia&gt; g(f::Foo) = f.a^<span>2</span> + f.b^<span>2</span>
g (generic <span>function</span> with <span>2</span> methods)

julia&gt; g(Foo(<span>2</span>,<span>3</span>))
<span>13</span></code></pre>
<p>There is also work in progress in Revise.jl to automatically redefine functions on replaced bindings. This should significantly reduce the number of times you have to restart Julia while iterating on some piece of code.</p>
<h2 id="new_tracing_flags_and_macros_for_inspecting_what_julia_compiles"><a href="#new_tracing_flags_and_macros_for_inspecting_what_julia_compiles">New tracing flags and macros for inspecting what Julia compiles</a></h2>
<p><em>Ian Butterworth</em>, <em>Nathan Daly</em></p>
<p><code>--trace-compile-timing</code> is a new command-line flag that augments <code>--trace-compile</code> by printing how long each compiled method took (in milliseconds) before the corresponding <code>precompile(...)</code> line. This makes it easier to spot costly compilations.</p>
<p>In addition, two macros for ad-hoc tracing without restarting Julia have been added:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>@trace_compile expr</code> runs <code>expr</code> with <code>--trace-compile=stderr --trace-compile-timing</code> enabled, emitting timed <code>precompile(...)</code> entries only for that call.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>@trace_dispatch expr</code> runs <code>expr</code> with <code>--trace-dispatch=stderr</code> enabled, reporting methods that are dynamically dispatched.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>

<h2 id="new_multi-threading_features"><a href="#new_multi-threading_features">New multi-threading features</a></h2>
<h3 id="one_interactive_thread_by_default"><a href="#one_interactive_thread_by_default">One interactive thread by default</a></h3>
<p><em>Gabriel Baraldi</em>, <em>Ian Butterworth</em></p>
<p>Julia now starts with one interactive thread by default (in addition to the default thread). This means that by default Julia runs with the threading configuration of 1 default thread, 1 interactive thread.</p>
<p>The interactive thread pool is where the REPL and other interactive operations run. By separating these from the default thread pool (where <code>@spawn</code> and <code>@threads</code> schedule work when no threadpool is specified), the REPL can perform operations like autocomplete queries in parallel with user code execution, leading to a more responsive interactive experience.</p>
<p><strong>Key behaviors:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Default</strong>: Julia starts with <code>-t1,1</code> (1 default + 1 interactive thread)</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Explicit <code>-t1</code></strong>: If you explicitly request 1 thread with <code>-t1</code>, Julia will give you exactly that—no additional interactive thread will be added (resulting in <code>-t1,0</code>)</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Multiple threads</strong>: <code>-t2</code> or <code>-tauto</code> will give you the requested default threads plus 1 interactive thread</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Manual control</strong>: You can always specify both pools explicitly, e.g., <code>-t4,2</code> for 4 default and 2 interactive threads</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This change improves the out-of-the-box experience while maintaining backwards compatibility for users who explicitly request single-threaded execution.</p>
<h3 id="threads_settings_respect_cpu_affinity"><a href="#threads_settings_respect_cpu_affinity">Threads settings respect CPU affinity</a></h3>
<p><em>Mosè Giordano</em></p>
<p>Julia now respects CPU affinity settings, such as those set via <code>cpuset</code>/<code>taskset</code>/<code>cgroups</code>, etc. The same also applies to the default number of BLAS threads, which now follows the same logic. This can also be observed when running Julia inside Docker. Currently, you have</p>
<pre><code><span>$ </span><span>docker run --cpus=4 --<span>rm</span> -ti julia:1.11 julia --threads=auto -e <span>'@show Threads.nthreads(); using LinearAlgebra; @show BLAS.get_num_threads()'</span></span>
Threads.nthreads() = 22
BLAS.get_num_threads() = 11</code></pre>
<p>When starting Julia with <code>--threads=auto</code>, <a href="https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/multi-threading/#Base.Threads.nthreads"><code>Threads.nthreads()</code></a> is equal to the total number of CPUs on the system instead of the only 4 CPUs reserved by Docker. Likewise, the number of BLAS threads, which can be obtained with <a href="https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/LinearAlgebra/#LinearAlgebra.BLAS.get_num_threads"><code>BLAS.get_num_threads()</code></a> and on x86-64 systems is by default half the number of available cores, is 11 instead of 2. With Julia v1.12 this is fixed, and the number of both Julia and BLAS threads will respect the number of CPUs reserved by Docker:</p>
<pre><code><span>% </span><span>docker run --cpus=4 --<span>rm</span> -ti julia:1.12 julia --threads=auto -e <span>'@show Threads.nthreads(); using LinearAlgebra; @show BLAS.get_num_threads()'</span></span>
Threads.nthreads() = 4
BLAS.get_num_threads() = 2</code></pre>
<p>The new behavior is also important to avoid oversubscription out-of-the-box when running Julia on HPC systems where schedulers set CPU affinity when using shared resources.</p>
<h3 id="onceperx"><a href="#onceperx"><code>OncePerX</code></a></h3>
<p><em>Jameson Nash</em></p>
<p>Certain initialization patterns need to run only once, depending on scope: per process, per thread, or per task. To make this easier and safer, Julia now provides three built-in types:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>OncePerProcess{T}</code>: runs an initializer exactly once per process, returning the same value for all future calls.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>OncePerThread{T}</code>: runs an initializer once for each thread ID. Subsequent calls on the same thread return the same value.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>OncePerTask{T}</code>: runs an initializer once per task, reusing the same value within that task.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These replace common hand-rolled solutions such as using <code>__init__</code>, <code>nthreads()</code>, or <code>task_local_storage()</code> directly.</p>
<p>A simple example of <code>OncePerProcess</code>:</p>
<pre><code>julia&gt; <span>const</span> global_state = Base.OncePerProcess{<span>Vector</span>{<span>UInt32</span>}}() <span>do</span>
           println(<span>"Making lazy global value...done."</span>)
           <span>return</span> [Libc.rand()]
       <span>end</span>;

julia&gt; a = global_state();
Making lazy <span>global</span> value...done.

julia&gt; a === global_state()
<span>true</span></code></pre>
<p><strong>Use cases:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>OncePerProcess</code>: caches, global constants, or initialization that should happen once per Julia process (even across precompilation).</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>OncePerThread</code>: per-thread state needed for interoperability with C libraries or specialized threading models.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>OncePerTask</code>: lightweight task-local state without manually managing <code>task_local_storage</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These types provide a safer, composable way to express “initialize once” semantics in concurrent Julia code.</p>

<p><em>Zentrik</em></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/bolt">BOLT</a> is a post-link optimizer from LLVM that improves runtime performance by reordering functions and basic blocks, splitting hot and cold code, and folding identical functions. Julia now supports building BOLT-optimized versions of <strong>libLLVM</strong>, <strong>libjulia-internal</strong>, and <strong>libjulia-codegen</strong>.</p>
<p>These optimizations reduce compilation and execution time in common workloads. For example, the all-inference benchmarks improve by about <strong>10%</strong>, an LLVM-heavy workload shows a similar <strong>~10%</strong> gain, and building <code>corecompiler.ji</code> improves by <strong>13–16%</strong> with BOLT. When combined with PGO and LTO, total improvements of up to <strong>~23%</strong> have been observed.</p>
<p>To build a BOLT-optimized Julia, run the following commands from <code>contrib/bolt/</code>:</p>
<pre><code>make stage1

<p>The optimized binaries will be available in the <code>optimized.build</code> directory. An analogous workflow exists in <code>contrib/pgo-lto-bolt/</code> for combining BOLT with PGO+LTO.</p>
<p>BOLT currently works only on Linux <strong>x86_64</strong> and <strong>aarch64</strong>, and the resulting <code>.so</code> files must not be stripped. Some <code>readelf</code> warnings may appear during testing but are considered harmless.</p>

<p><em>Marek Kaluba</em></p>
<p>The <code>@atomic</code> macro family now supports <strong>indexing</strong> (e.g. <code>m[i]</code>, <code>m[i,j]</code>) in addition to field access. This makes it possible to perform atomic fetch, set, modify, swap, compare-and-swap, and set-once directly on array-like references. The macros expand to new APIs: <code>getindex_atomic</code>, <code>setindex_atomic!</code>, <code>modifyindex_atomic!</code>, <code>swapindex_atomic!</code>, <code>replaceindex_atomic!</code>, and <code>setindexonce_atomic!</code>. Vararg and <code>CartesianIndex</code> indexing are supported.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>mem = AtomicMemory{<span>Int</span>}(<span>undef</span>, <span>2</span>)

<span>@atomic</span> mem[<span>1</span>] = <span>2</span>                 <span># atomic set</span>
x = <span>@atomic</span> mem[<span>1</span>]                 <span># atomic fetch</span>
<span>@atomic</span> :monotonic mem[<span>1</span>] += <span>1</span>     <span># atomic modify with order</span>
old = <span>@atomicswap</span> mem[<span>1</span>] = <span>4</span>       <span># atomic swap (returns old)</span>
res = <span>@atomicreplace</span> mem[<span>1</span>] <span>4</span> =&gt; <span>10</span>  <span># (old=4, success=true)</span>
ok  = <span>@atomiconce</span> mem[<span>2</span>] = <span>7</span>         <span># set once (Bool)</span></code></pre>

<p>Two new per-task metrics can be enabled by starting Julia with <code>--task-metrics=yes</code> or by calling <code>Base.Experimental.task_metrics(true)</code>. Enabling or disabling task metrics with <code>Base.Experimental.task_metrics</code> only affects new tasks, not existing ones. The metrics are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>Base.Experimental.task_running_time_ns(t::Task)</code>: the time for which <code>t</code> was actually running. This is currently inclusive of GC time, compilation time, and any spin time.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>Base.Experimental.task_wall_time_ns(t::Task)</code>: the time from the scheduler becoming aware of <code>t</code> until <code>t</code> is complete.</p>

<h3 id="workspace"><a href="#workspace">Workspace</a></h3>
<p>A workspace is a set of project files that all share the same manifest. Each project in a workspace can include its own dependencies, compatibility information, and even function as a full package.</p>
<p>When the package manager resolves dependencies, it considers the requirements and compatibility of all the projects in the workspace. The compatible versions identified during this process are recorded in a single manifest file.</p>
<p>A workspace is defined in the base project by giving a list of the projects in it:</p>
<pre><code><span>[workspace]</span>
<span>projects</span> = [<span>"test"</span>, <span>"docs"</span>, <span>"benchmarks"</span>, <span>"PrivatePackage"</span>]</code></pre>
<p>This structure is particularly beneficial for developers using a monorepo approach, where a large number of unregistered packages may be involved. It is also useful for adding documentation or benchmarks to a package by including additional dependencies beyond those of the package itself. Test-specific dependencies are now recommended to be specified using the workspace approach (a project file in the <code>test</code> directory that is part of the workspace defined by the package project file).</p>
<p>Workspaces can also be nested: a project that itself defines a workspace can also be part of another workspace. In this case, the workspaces are “merged,” with a single manifest being stored alongside the “root project” (the project that is not included in another workspace).</p>
<h3 id="apps"><a href="#apps">Apps</a></h3>
<p>An app is a Julia package that can be run directly from the terminal, similar to a standalone program. Each app provides an entry point via <code>@main</code> and can define its own default Julia flags and executable name.</p>
<p>When an app is installed, it gets put into <code>.julia/bin</code> and by adding that to your <code>PATH</code> it allows you to launch it by name together with any arguments or options.</p>
<p>A Julia app is defined in the <code>Project.toml</code> file using an <code>[apps]</code> section:</p>
<pre><code><span>[apps]</span>
<span>reverse</span> = {} <span># empty dictionary is for additional metadata</span></code></pre>
<p>with a corresponding entry point in the package module:</p>
<pre><code><span># src/MyReverseApp.jl</span>
<span>module</span> MyReverseApp

<span>function</span> (<span>@main</span>)(<span>ARGS</span>)
    <span>for</span> arg <span>in</span> <span>ARGS</span>
        print(<span>stdout</span>, reverse(arg), <span>" "</span>)
    <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>end</span> <span># module</span></code></pre>
<p>After installation, the app can be run directly in the terminal:</p>
<pre><code>$ reverse some input string
emos tupni gnirts</code></pre>
<p>This makes apps useful for building CLI tools or packaging Julia functionality as user-facing executables. Multiple apps can be defined per package by using submodules, and each app can specify default Julia flags (e.g. <code>--threads=4</code>) for performance or debugging.</p>
<p>See the full documentation for more information: https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/dev/apps/</p>
<h3 id="status_highlights_when_dependencies_have_different_loaded_versions"><a href="#status_highlights_when_dependencies_have_different_loaded_versions">Status highlights when dependencies have different loaded versions</a></h3>
<p><code>Pkg.status()</code> now highlights when a dependency's loaded version differs from what the current environment would load. This helps identify situations where you may be running code against an outdated or mismatched version of a package—particularly useful when switching between environments or after modifying dependencies.</p>
<p>When a package is already loaded from a different version or path than what the current environment specifies, Pkg will display a yellow <code>[loaded: vX.Y.Z]</code> indicator next to the package name:</p>
<p><img src="https://julialang.org/assets/blog/2025-1.12-highlights/pkg-status-loaded-version.png" alt="Pkg.status showing loaded version highlight"></p>
<p>This visual cue makes it easier to spot when you need to restart Julia to pick up the correct package versions, reducing debugging time and confusion in iterative development workflows.</p>
<h2 id="generated_llvm_ir_now_uses_pointer_types_instead_of_passing_pointers_as_integers"><a href="#generated_llvm_ir_now_uses_pointer_types_instead_of_passing_pointers_as_integers">Generated LLVM IR now uses pointer types instead of passing pointers as integers</a></h2>
<p><em>Tim Besard</em></p>
<p><code>Ptr{T}</code> now lowers to <strong>actual LLVM pointer types</strong> in generated IR (i.e. <code>ptr</code> with opaque pointers, or <code>i8*</code>), instead of integers like <code>i64</code>. This simplifies low-level interop: <code>llvmcall</code> no longer needs <code>ptrtoint</code>/<code>inttoptr</code> shims, and many intrinsics can be called via <code>ccall</code> using <code>Ptr</code> directly.</p>
<p><strong>What changes for you</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Inline LLVM (<code>llvmcall</code>)</strong>: update IR to use <code>ptr</code>/<code>i8*</code> for pointer arguments/returns, and remove redundant <code>ptrtoint</code>/<code>inttoptr</code> casts. Old IR that treats pointers as integers is still accepted but emits a <strong>deprecation warning</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Pointer arithmetic</strong>: <code>add_ptr</code> / <code>sub_ptr</code> now operate on real pointers: <code>add_ptr(::Ptr{T}, ::UInt)</code> and <code>sub_ptr(::Ptr{T}, ::UInt)</code> (lowered to GEP).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong><code>ccall</code> convenience</strong>: passing/returning <code>Ptr{T}</code> maps to LLVM pointer types directly, enabling more intrinsic calls without custom <code>llvmcall</code> glue.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example (before → after)</strong></p>
<pre><code>; BEFORE (deprecated): integer pointer
define i64 <span>@f</span>(i64 %p) {
  %q = inttoptr i64 %p to i8*
  ; ...
  %r = ptrtoint i8* %q to i64
  ret i64 %r
}

; AFTER: real pointer
define ptr <span>@f</span>(ptr %p) {
  ; ...
  ret ptr %p
}</code></pre>
<p>This change also unlocks minor optimization opportunities in generated code since pointers no longer bounce through integer casts.</p>
<h2 id="reproducing_rng_state_in_testsets"><a href="#reproducing_rng_state_in_testsets">Reproducing RNG state in testsets</a></h2>
<p><em>Mosè Giordano</em></p>
<p>Many developers may have experience with occasional failures when running tests of their packages which were observed only on remote machines, and wished to be able to reproduce the same run, for debugging purposes. The GitHub Actions workflow <a href="https://github.com/julia-actions/julia-runtest"><code>julia-actions/julia-runtest</code></a> recently started printing to the log the full options used to invoke the Julia process which runs the tests, which lets developers use the same compiler options (e.g. bounds checking, code coverage, deprecation warnings, etc.) as the CI runs. However there are occasional failures which don't depend on compiler options, but may depend on the state of the global random number generator (RNG), if for example the input data of the tests is generated with functions like <a href="https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Random/#Base.rand"><code>rand</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Random/#Base.randn"><code>randn</code></a>, without passing an explicit RNG object, instead relying on the global one. The <a href="https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Test/#Test.@testset"><code>Test.@testset</code></a> macro has had for a long time the feature of automatically controlling the global RNG, but until now its state was never displayed. Starting from Julia v1.12, a failure inside a <code>@testset</code> causes the RNG of the outermost test set to be printed to screen, which then you can also set in a new test set to exactly reproduce the same run.</p>
<p>As an example, consider the following test which would fail with a 0.1% probability:</p>
<pre><code><span>julia&gt;</span><span> <span>using</span> Test
</span>
<span>julia&gt;</span><span> <span>@testset</span> <span>begin</span>
           <span>@test</span> rand() &gt; <span>0.001</span>
       <span>end</span>;
</span>test set: Test Failed at REPL[2]:2

That’s because, in a highly technological world, your ability to do well (or even to live out the day) requires that you correctly navigate innumerable highly technical questions that you can’t possibly answer.</p>
<p>You need to know whether you can trust the software in your car’s antilock braking system, whether you should heed your doctor’s advice to get vaccinated, whether the joists over your head at home are sufficient to keep the ceiling from falling in and killing you, and whether your kids’ schooling is adequate or likely to turn them into ignoramuses.</p>
<p>Tech-like apps can obfuscate what’s really going on, sloshing a coat of complexity over a business that allows its owners to claim that they’re not breaking the law.</p>
<p>It’s not that you lack the intellect and discernment to answer each of these questions. You’re a smart cookie. Given enough time, you could get a PhD’s worth of education in software engineering, cell biology, material science, structural engineering, and pedagogy; investigate each of the offerings before you in each of these categories; and make an intelligent choice that reflects your priorities and the trade-offs you’re willing to make.</p>
<p>The problem is that it would take you several lifetimes to acquire all that knowledge, and long before you could do so, you’d be killed by food poisoning because you guessed wrong about whether you could trust the hygiene policies at your local diner.</p><div><p><span>Article continues after advertisement</span></p><!-- GAM 22020028882/LTHB_lithubcom/Article_Incontent_1 -->
</div>
<p>It would be nice if you could let markets take care of these questions for you, but many of the consequences of wrong answers don’t manifest fast enough to steer your decision-making. Sure, if a private school turns one of your kids into an ignoramus, you can demand your money back and refuse to send your other kids to that school—but your kid is <em>still</em> an ignoramus. Likewise, you can punish a restaurant that gives you food poisoning by withholding your future custom, but if that’s a <em>lethal</em> poisoning, the fact that you don’t eat at that restaurant anymore isn’t quite the moral victory you might be hoping for.</p>
<p>To navigate all of these technical minefields, you need the help of a third party. In a modern society, that third party is an expert regulator who investigates or anticipates problems in their area of expertise and then makes rules designed to solve these problems.</p>
<p>To make these rules, the regulator convenes a truth-seeking exercise, in which all affected parties submit evidence about what the best rule should be and then get a chance to read what everyone else wrote and rebut their claims. Sometimes, there are in-person hearings, or successive rounds of comment and counter-comment, but that’s the basic shape of things.</p>
<p>Once all the evidence is in, the regulator—who is a neutral expert, required to recuse themselves if they have conflicts—makes a rule, citing the evidence on which the rule is based. This whole system is backstopped by courts, which can order the process to begin anew if the new rule isn’t supported by the evidence created while the regulator was developing the record.</p>
<p>This kind of adversarial process—something between a court case and scientific peer review—has a good track record of producing high-quality regulations. You can thank a process like this for the fact that you weren’t killed today by critters in your tap water or a high-voltage shock from one of your home’s electrical outlets.</p><div><p><span>Article continues after advertisement</span></p><!-- GAM 22020028882/LTHB_lithubcom/Article_Incontent_2 -->
</div>
<p>One key advantage of the process is that it relies on competitors to counter one another’s claims. The reinforced steel joist manufacturer that claims that only its products are suitable for use in high-rise apartment buildings will have to defend those claims against competitors who submit their own structural engineering and material science evidence. Regulators don’t need to look for holes in the arguments advanced by interested parties; they only need to assess the quality of the criticisms raised by other commenters who submit to the docket.</p>
<p>This process isn’t just a way to prevent corporate executives from cheating the public by knowingly overpromising about their own products or denigrating their rivals’; it’s also a way to stop firms that have tricked <em>themselves</em> from fooling the rest of us, too. As with the scientific method, the safeguards of peer review help us catch grubby attempts at both deception and <em>self</em>-deception, because it’s <em>very</em> easy to talk yourself into a sincere belief that you are right and everyone else is wrong.</p>
<p>This process works well on “disorganized” sectors composed of many firms that compete hard with one another. When hundreds of companies are all at one another’s throats, they suffer from a collective action problem—the same force that keeps users from leaving services like Facebook.</p>
<p>Hundreds of companies find it impossible to agree on almost <em>anything</em>, including where to have a meeting in which they could discuss what line they are going to feed their regulator. They probably can’t even agree on how to cater that meeting.</p>
<p>Hundreds of companies are a disorganized rabble. They can’t come to accord, and even if they could, a truly competitive sector produces smaller profits for each company (since one of the best ways to compete is by lowering prices to attract new customers and raising wages to attract the best workers). That leaves very little surplus capital with which to pursue regulatory adventures.</p><div><p><span>Article continues after advertisement</span></p><!-- GAM 22020028882/LTHB_lithubcom/Article_Incontent_3 -->
</div>
<p>But when a sector dwindles to five companies—or four, or three, or two, or just one—the collective action problem is annihilated by the inevitable coziness among the executives of the incestuous industries.</p>
<p>After all, the executives in an industry dominated by a handful of firms are apt to have worked at most or all of the companies in the sector. They know one another, came up together, and are part of one another’s social milieu.</p>
<p>Not only do concentrated industries find it easier to converge on a set of policy priorities and maintain message discipline while bargaining with their regulators, they also have a lot to bargain <em>with</em>. Concentrated sectors tend to have Mafia-style demarcations of turf. (Think of Pope Alexander VI dividing up the “New World” in 1494, of cable companies carving up the map of the United States into exclusive fiefdoms, or of Apple taking an annual $20 billion-plus payment from Google in exchange for not making its own search engine.)</p>
<p>This prevents “wasteful competition” and allows these companies to amass gigantic war chests that they can mobilize to win their policy priorities.</p>
<p>A hundred companies are a mob, a rabble. Five companies are a cartel.</p><div><p><span>Article continues after advertisement</span></p><!-- GAM 22020028882/LTHB_lithubcom/Article_Incontent_4 -->

<p>“Regulatory capture”—when a company suborns its regulator and teams up with it to screw over customers, rivals, and suppliers—starts with a regulator that is weaker than the company it is supposed to be watchdogging. The pro-monopoly policies of the past forty years have produced <em>gigantic</em> companies that find it easy to unite against their regulators, even as the deregulatory policies over the same period have starved regulators of the resources they need to fight back. The inevitable result is regulatory capture.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Regulatory capture has two faces: On the one hand, a captured industry is able to flout regulations that are meant to prevent it from harming the public, its employees and other stakeholders, and the environment. On the other hand, regulatory capture creates a <em>coalition</em> between the regulated industry and its regulators. They form a team and work together to enforce rules against other industries, startups, foreign adversaries, and so on. Regulatory capture isn’t the same as <em>underregulation</em>; rather, it is the combination of <em>underregulation</em> (for the industry that has effected the capture) and <em>overregulation</em> (against that industry’s enemies).</p>
<p>Tech companies don’t stop with “It’s not a crime if we do it with an app.” They also say, “It’s a crime if you fix our app to defend yourself from our crimes.”</p>
<p>The most common tactic used to flout regulation is to break the law with an app and then insist that the law hasn’t been broken at all, because the crime was committed with an app.</p>
<p>Sometimes literally (as Uber does when it argues that it’s not an employer because it directs its workers with an app) and sometimes figuratively. Tech-like apps can obfuscate what’s really going on, sloshing a coat of complexity over a business that allows its owners to claim that they’re not breaking the law. (“It’s not an illegal unregulated hotel, it’s an Airbnb!”)</p>
<p>Riley Quinn, showrunner for the excellent <em>Trashfuture</em> podcast, says that whenever you hear the word <em>fintech</em> (financial technology), you should mentally substitute <em>unregulated bank</em>.</p>
<p>App-based lending platforms ignore usury law and say it doesn’t count because they do it with an app. Cryptocurrency hustlers illegally trade in unregistered securities and say it doesn’t count because they do it with an app.</p>
<p>When Uber entered the taxi market without securing taxi licenses or extending the workforce protections required under law, it said the move didn’t count because it did it with an app.</p>
<p>The McDonald’s-backed company Plexure sells surveillance data on you to vendors, who use it to raise the price of items when they think you’ll pay more. In its promotional materials, Plexure uses the example of charging extra for your breakfast sandwich on payday. It says that such practices are not a rip-off because they’re done with an app.</p>
<p>RealPage gives “recommendations” to landlords about the minimum rents they should charge for all the apartments in your neighborhood, raising rents and worsening the housing crisis. The company says it’s not price-fixing because it’s done with an app.</p>
<p>On the subject of the housing crisis, Airbnb is racing to convert all the rental stock in your city into an unlicensed hotel room, but it says the conversion doesn’t count because it’s done with an app.</p>
<p>The legal regime for apps really <em>is</em> different from the rules governing web pages. Thanks to intellectual property laws that ban “circumvention,” companies that embed undesirable anti-features in apps can use the law to destroy rivals that disenshittify their offerings.</p>
<p>In other words, tech companies don’t stop with “It’s not a crime if we do it with an app.” They also say, “It’s a crime if you fix our app to defend yourself from our crimes.”</p>

						<p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
					</div><div lang="en" dir="ltr" id="mw-content-text"><p>The <b>Ortega hypothesis</b> holds that average or mediocre <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientists" title="Scientists">scientists</a> contribute substantially to the advancement of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science" title="Science">science</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Hess_1-0"><a href="#cite_note-Hess-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> According to this hypothesis, scientific progress occurs mainly by the accumulation of a mass of modest, narrowly specialized intellectual contributions. On this view, major breakthroughs draw heavily upon a large body of minor and little-known work, without which the major advances could not happen.<sup id="cite_ref-Cole_2-0"><a href="#cite_note-Cole-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p>
<meta property="mw:PageProp/toc">

<p>The Ortega hypothesis is widely held,<sup id="cite_ref-Cole_2-1"><a href="#cite_note-Cole-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> but a number of systematic studies of scientific <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citations" title="Citations">citations</a> have favored the opposing "Newton hypothesis", which says that scientific progress is mostly the work of a relatively small number of great scientists (after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton" title="Isaac Newton">Isaac Newton</a>'s statement that he "stood on the shoulders of giants").<sup id="cite_ref-Hess_1-1"><a href="#cite_note-Hess-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> The most important papers mostly cite other important papers by a small number of outstanding scientists, suggesting that the breakthroughs do not actually draw heavily on a large body of minor work.<sup id="cite_ref-Cole_2-2"><a href="#cite_note-Cole-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>  Rather, the pattern of citations suggests that most minor work draws heavily on a small number of outstanding papers and outstanding scientists. Even minor papers by the most eminent scientists are cited much more than papers by relatively unknown scientists; and these elite scientists are clustered mostly in a small group of elite departments and universities.<sup id="cite_ref-Cole_2-3"><a href="#cite_note-Cole-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> The same pattern of disproportionate citation of a small number of scholars appears in fields as diverse as physics and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminology" title="Criminology">criminology</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Oromaner_3-0"><a href="#cite_note-Oromaner-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p><p>The matter is not settled. No research has established that citation counts reflect the real influence or worth of scientific work. So, the apparent disproof of the Ortega hypothesis may be an artifact of inappropriately chosen data.<sup id="cite_ref-MacRoberts_4-0"><a href="#cite_note-MacRoberts-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> Stratification within the social networks of scientists may skew the citation statistics.<sup id="cite_ref-Kretschmer_5-0"><a href="#cite_note-Kretschmer-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> Many authors cite research papers without actually reading them or being influenced by them.<sup id="cite_ref-Hoerman_6-0"><a href="#cite_note-Hoerman-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> Experimental results in physics make heavy use of techniques and devices that have been honed by many previous inventors and researchers, but these are seldom cited in reports on those results.<sup id="cite_ref-Goudsmit_7-0"><a href="#cite_note-Goudsmit-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-eponym_8-0"><a href="#cite_note-eponym-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> Theoretical papers have the broadest relevance to future research, while reports of experimental results have a narrower relevance but form the basis of the theories. This suggests that citation counts merely favor theoretical results.<sup id="cite_ref-Goudsmit_7-1"><a href="#cite_note-Goudsmit-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p>

<p>The name of the hypothesis refers to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Ortega_y_Gasset" title="José Ortega y Gasset">José Ortega y Gasset</a>, who wrote in <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Revolt_of_the_Masses" title="The Revolt of the Masses">The Revolt of the Masses</a></i> that "astoundingly mediocre" men of narrow specialties do most of the work of experimental science.<sup id="cite_ref-Ortega_9-0"><a href="#cite_note-Ortega-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> Ortega most likely would have disagreed with the hypothesis that has been named after him, as he held not that scientific progress is driven mainly by the accumulation of small works by mediocrities, but that scientific <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geniuses" title="Geniuses">geniuses</a> create a framework within which intellectually commonplace people can work successfully. For example, Ortega thought that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> drew upon the ideas of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant" title="Immanuel Kant">Immanuel Kant</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Mach" title="Ernst Mach">Ernst Mach</a> to form his own synthesis, and that Einstein did not draw upon masses of tiny results produced systematically by mediocrities. According to Ortega, science is mostly the work of geniuses, and geniuses mostly build on each other's work, but in some fields there is a real need for systematic laboratory work that could be done by almost anyone.<sup id="cite_ref-Szava_10-0"><a href="#cite_note-Szava-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p><p>The "Ortega hypothesis" derives only from this last element of Ortega's theory, not the main thrust of it. Ortega characterized this type of research as "mechanical work of the mind" that does not require special talent or even much understanding of the results, performed by people who specialize in one narrow corner of one science and hold no curiosity beyond it.<sup id="cite_ref-Szava_10-1"><a href="#cite_note-Szava-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>RSS feeds and, in one form or another, feed readers, have existed for more than 20 years. Their main purpose is enabling their users to consume content from various sources in one place. And especially in recent years, also helping users deal with content overload.</p>
<p>Back then there were only a handful of relevant products. Today it's different, there are products for many different situations and use-cases. When first getting into RSS and feed readers, it can be difficult to find out which of this wide range of products are the right ones to use.</p>
<p>This article describes the landscape so you can find out which product fits best for your use-case.</p>
<p>Side-note: I'm using RSS as a synonym for all web feed standards (Atom, JSON Feed)</p>
<h2>Classification</h2>
<p>I attempted a classification of feed readers based on 2 axes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deployment model</strong>: local (phone or PC), browser extension, self-hosted, hosted</li>
<li><strong>Business model</strong>: free, one-time payment, SAAS</li>
</ul>
<p>The deployment model is based on where data is stored and feed fetching happens. Some products have a web app and mobile apps, but feed fetching happens on the server. In this case it's classified as <code>hosted</code>.</p>
<p>The business model categorization is based on the cheapest option that gives access to the full feature set of the product. A self-hostable product with a hosted option is categorized into <code>free</code>. A freemium SAAS product is categorized as <code>paid (SAAS)</code>.</p>

<h2>Hosting models</h2>
<h3>Browser extension</h3>
<p>Feed readers deployed as browser extensions can be installed through the respective stores of the browsers, usually either the <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/">Chrome Web Store</a> or the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/">Firefox Add-ons</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Setup and maintenance</strong>: Setup typically only requires installing the extension, not even an account is needed. There is no maintenance required beyond the occasional update, which usually happens automatically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data control and storage</strong>: Data is stored locally, with browser storage functionality (local storage or IndexedDB). How much data can be stored depends on the storage of the device. Browser extensions can only <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/permissions#unlimited_storage">store</a> as much data as the browser <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/storage/local">allows itself to use</a>. But for most users this is easily enough.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Feed fetching</strong>: Feeds are fetched on the device itself. Because the extension only runs if the browser runs, feeds are only fetched if the browser is open. This can lead to missed posts, depending on the publishing frequency of the feed and how often the browser is active.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Availability</strong>: Since all data is stored on the device, by default it's available only on the device where the extension is installed. If users enable it, the extension supports it, and the user is signed in, browsers can sync data to other devices that have the extension. Storing all data on the device also means that it is accessible offline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Functionality</strong>: Extensions can integrate deeply with the browser, and offer features like automatic feed finding of visited websites. Extensions can also provide a comprehensive feature set. Their only limitations are more compute-intensive features (e.g. requiring machine learning), or features that require special infrastructure to run (e.g. emails).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Products (free)</h4>
<div><table><thead><tr><th>Free</th>
<th>Paid (one-time)</th>
<th>Paid (SAAS)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li><a href="https://nodetics.com/feedbro/">Feedbro</a></li></ul></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<p>In this category I only found one product. <a href="https://github.com/SmartRSS/Smart-RSS">Smart-RSS</a> was another one, but was discontinued in February.</p>
<h3>On-device</h3>
<p>On-device products are separate applications and installed on the device you want to use them. Either on your iOS or Android phone or tablet, or on your Windows, Mac, or Linux computer. They fetch feeds and store data on that device.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Setup and maintenance</strong>: In general setup is done by installing the application. Some products may require an account, but that is not the norm. Maintenance is similar to browser extensions, the occasional updates. Some applications require manual update installations, others do that automatically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data control and storage</strong>: Data is stored locally on the device, which gives total control over the data. The maximum amount of feeds and articles stored only depend on the available storage of the device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Feed fetching</strong>: Feeds are fetched on the device. For that to happen the application must be running. Some products may implement a background fetching service, in that case only the device must be turned on. Similar to browser extensions, this limitation may lead to missed posts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Availability</strong>: Typically the data of on-device feed readers are only available on the device where it's installed. Data sync would need to be done manually or via operating system specific mechanisms (e.g. iCloud), which not all products support. Since data is stored on the device, it's also available offline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Functionality</strong>: On-device products can use the full computing power of the device. Combined with the comparatively small storage requirements of one user, it means that some features can be significantly faster than other categories. The exact features depend on the application, and mobile apps are typically less powerful than desktop apps. Limitations are only features that require multiple users (e.g. recommendations) or specific infrastructure (e.g. newsletter subscriptions).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Products</h4>

<h3>Self-hosted</h3>
<p>Self-hosted products all fall into the open-source and free category. They are designed to be installed on a server to run continuously, though it is possible to install them on a PC as well. They fetch feeds and store data on the server, and make it available through a web interface.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Setup and maintenance</strong>: Setup requires a server, installing the application, and depending on how it should be accessible, possibly also domain and reverse proxy setup. This needs significantly more technical knowledge than the other options, but with ChatGPT (or others) it should be possible also for fairly non-technical people. This setup is generally more complex with more failure points than the other options, but with a correct setup failures happen rarely, if at all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data control and storage</strong>: The application stores data on the server it runs on. Since users control their server, they also have total control over the data stored on it. Applications typically use well-established databases, which allows users to inspect and change data with common tools. The amount of data that can be stored is only limited by the available storage on the server. Most servers start at 20 GB, which is enough for most feed reading use-cases. Often, storage can be dynamically extended if more space is needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Feed fetching</strong>: Feeds are fetched on the server. Since it runs continuously, there is no break in feed fetching, and even high frequency feeds are no problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Availability</strong>: The application and all its data is accessible from any device with a web browser by navigating to the server's URL. Data is stored on the server, therefore automatically synced between all devices that use it, but also require internet access.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Functionality</strong>: On average self-hosted products have a wider feature set than browser extension or on-device feed readers. There is no theoretical limit on the feature set, but typically they keep the infrastructure as simple as possible, to keep setup and maintenance straightforward. This makes them slightly less powerful than hosted alternatives.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Products</h4>

<p>Self-hosted products are all open-source and free. The only costs are for the server, and the cheapest VPS plans start at ~2$/month.</p>
<h3>Hosted</h3>
<p>Hosted feed readers are managed services. It's required to create an account to get access to them. All of them are paid SAAS products, and most offer a free plan.</p>
<p>On average they have the most polished user experience and most comprehensive feature sets, since they're backed by companies that invest in continuous development.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Setup and maintenance</strong>: Beyond creating an account, no setup is required. The same for maintenance. Service providers make sure the products work as intended, and deal with everything required to keep the service running, including infrastructure setup, monitoring, backups, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data control and storage</strong>: Since data is stored on the servers and databases of the company running the product, users don't have direct control. But through laws like GDPR users have the right to export all their data, or request deletion. Storage is essentially unlimited, though most products have limits to avoid abuse. These limits are mentioned on their pricing page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Feed fetching</strong>: Similar to self-hosted products, feeds are fetched on the server, which runs continuously and ensures that even high-frequency feeds don't pose a problem. The fetching interval is usually dynamic, based on the popularity of a feed and the publishing frequency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Availability</strong>: Hosted products are primarily available as web application, and some offer native apps as well. Since data is stored on the server, it's natively synced between devices. Some hosted feed readers also offer offline support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Functionality</strong>: Hosted feed readers serve many customers at the same time, which makes it necessary to have more complex infrastructure setups. This also enables features that other types of products cannot do, like email receiving, recommendations, or historic feed contents. Consequently hosted options are generally more powerful than other categories, though the specific feature set depends on the product.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Products</h4>

<p>All hosted products are SAAS products and charge monthly. <code>Folo</code> is an outlier, they currently don't have any paid features, but the terms of service indicate that this will come in the future. At that point it will join the others in the <code>Paid (SAAS)</code> category.</p>
<h2>App support and offline access for products that don't offer it natively</h2>
<p>Many of the self-hosted or hosted products don't provide apps or offline access by themselves. However, with the right setup, it's still possible to access the articles offline.</p>
<p>Most of these products provide APIs. This can be a proprietary API, or an API based on the old Google Reader API.</p>
<p>Mobile apps, for example ReadKit or Fiery Feeds, can not only subscribe to feeds, but also connect to other products through their APIs. They download contents, store them locally, and sync changes back to the connected products.</p>
<p>These apps make it possible to use a native mobile app for products that don't provide an app themselves, and get offline access at the same time.</p>
<p>FreshRSS, for example, has a <a href="https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/blob/edge/README.md#apis--native-apps">list of native apps</a> that support it.</p>
<h2>A note on newsletters</h2>
<p>Newsletters are a growing mechanism for delivering (blog) content. Some, but not all, hosted feed readers support newsletters out of the box. But on-device products can't do that at all because of their infrastructure limitations.</p>
<p>Even if a feed reader doesn't support newsletters by itself, it's still possible to get newsletters into the feed reader, through services that convert newsletters into RSS feeds.</p>
<p>These services generate an email address and give you a corresponding feed URL. Emails to the generated address are added to the feed as new entry. So after signing up to the newsletter and adding the feed URL, the newsletter is added to the feed reader even without native email support.</p>
<p>Services that do this are <a href="https://kill-the-newsletter.com/">Kill the Newsletter</a> and the <a href="https://lighthouseapp.io/tools/newsletter-to-rss">Lighthouse Newsletter to RSS tool</a>. Both are free.</p>
<h2>Products</h2>
<p>The descriptions highlight the defining and unique aspects of the products, for the full feature list please go to their respective websites. Where available I used the screenshots for their websites, to represent the products as best as possible (test account screenshots wouldn't be as good).</p>
<h3>NetNewsWire (on-device, free)</h3>
<p><a href="https://netnewswire.com/">NetNewsWire</a> is a free, on-device feed reader for Mac and iOS. By default it stores data on the device itself, but can sync via iCloud and using other products as storage. And it provides a Safari extension for easy feed-adding. Notably, it supports AppleScript, which makes it possible to automate certain workflows.</p>

<h3>Fiery Feeds (on device, paid SAAS)</h3>
<p>Fiery feeds is a Mac and iOS app. The download is free, and to get the premium features it costs ~15$/year (varies by region). By default it stores data on the device itself, but can sync via iCloud and using the API of other products (e.g. FreshRSS). The main distinguishing features are the customization options of the app, like custom themes.</p>
<p><img alt="" blurwidth="8" blurheight="6" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="783" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Ffieryfeeds.29a8e85b.png&amp;w=1080&amp;q=75 1x, https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Ffieryfeeds.29a8e85b.png&amp;w=2048&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Ffieryfeeds.29a8e85b.png&amp;w=2048&amp;q=75"></p><p>Screenshot from voidstern.net/fiery-feeds</p>
<h3>Reeder (on-device, SAAS)</h3>
<p>The current version of <a href="https://reederapp.com/">Reeder</a> is a Mac and iOS app. The download is free, and to get the premium features it costs ~10$/year. The previous version of Reeder, now called <a href="https://reederapp.com/classic/">Reeder Classic</a>, is still available as one-time purchase. It also stores data on-device, and can sync via iCloud.</p>
<p>The main distinguishing feature is the unified timeline, which includes RSS, podcasts, social media, and more.</p>
<p><img alt="" blurwidth="8" blurheight="5" loading="lazy" width="1604" height="968" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Freeder.4f5d9f19.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Freeder.4f5d9f19.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Freeder.4f5d9f19.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p><p>Screenshot from App Store Reeder page</p>
<h3>FreshRSS (self-hosted, free)</h3>
<p><a href="https://freshrss.org/">FreshRSS</a> is a self-hosted feed reader and once set up, it's available as a web app. It is quite powerful, and in addition to normal feed subscriptions offers WebSub as well. It's possible to customize it with themes and extensions, and it's translated into more than 15 languages.</p>
<p>Together with Miniflux they're the most-recommended self-hosted options.</p>
<p><img alt="" blurwidth="8" blurheight="4" loading="lazy" width="2454" height="1251" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Ffreshrss.f7bbd93e.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Ffreshrss.f7bbd93e.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p><p>Screenshot from freshrss.org</p>
<h3>Miniflux</h3>
<p><a href="https://miniflux.app/">Miniflux</a> is a self-hosted feed reader as well, and available as web app after setup. It's focus is on staying simple and fast instead of adding fancy features. It also offers a hosted version, which is 15$/year and has a 15 day trial period.</p>
<p>Together with FreshRSS they're the most-recommended self-hosted options.</p>
<p><img alt="" blurwidth="8" blurheight="5" loading="lazy" width="756" height="483" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fminiflux.ed838882.png&amp;w=828&amp;q=75 1x, https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fminiflux.ed838882.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fminiflux.ed838882.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75"></p><p>Screenshot from miniflux.app</p>
<h3>Folo (hosted, free)</h3>
<p>Folo is a relatively new product developed by the creators of RSS Hub. It's a free hosted feed reader, with apps available for every major platform. Their <a href="https://folo.is/terms-of-service">terms of service</a> suggest that at some point they will charge a monthly fee for some premium features, but at the time of writing there were no paid features.</p>
<p>Folo is also open-source and therefore theoretically self-hostable, but I haven't found documentation for it.</p>
<p>It has a huge feature set, including newsletter support, transforming websites into feeds, AI summaries, and much more.</p>
<p><img alt="" blurwidth="8" blurheight="4" loading="lazy" width="1287" height="686" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Ffolo.80cb9fb3.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Ffolo.80cb9fb3.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Ffolo.80cb9fb3.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p><h3>Feedly (hosted, SAAS)</h3>
<p><a href="https://feedly.com/news-reader">Feedly</a> is the most widely-known product and has the most users of all feed readers. It has a comprehensive features set, and offers a free plan as well. For the past couple of years, it seems that Feedly has focused more on AI features and enterprise customers, but their core product remains solid.</p>
<p><img alt="" blurwidth="8" blurheight="4" loading="lazy" width="1427" height="775" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Ffeedly.bd52d615.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Ffeedly.bd52d615.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Ffeedly.bd52d615.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p><p>Screenshot from feedly.com/news-reader</p>
<h3>Inoreader</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.inoreader.com/">Inoreader</a> is the second most widely-known product, after Feedly. It too offers a free plan. Their feature list is impressive, with social media support for subscriptions, automation and AI features, public API and integrations. And of course much more.</p>
<p>What stands out on Reddit are complaints about price hikes. Though Inoreader probably has tens or hundreds of thousands of users who don't have issues and think the product is great.</p>

<h3>Readwise Reader</h3>
<p><a href="https://readwise.io/read">Readwise Reader</a> is a relatively new product, from the creators of the original <a href="https://readwise.io/">Readwise</a>. It's a great feed reader, though were it really shines is the reading experience. They also have reading views for PDFs, eBooks, and more.</p>
<p>The website mentions that it's in beta, but it has been in beta for years now and at this point is a stable product, and has been for awhile.</p>
<p><img alt="" blurwidth="8" blurheight="5" loading="lazy" width="1205" height="807" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Freadwise.d3938127.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Freadwise.d3938127.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Freadwise.d3938127.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p><p>Screenshot from readwise.io/read</p>
<h3>Tiny Tiny RSS</h3>
<p>Tiny Tiny RSS deserves an honorable mention in this list. It was, and still is, used by many, and has been for a long time, and was often recommended on the RSS subreddit.</p>
<p>On October 3rd the maintainer <a href="https://community.tt-rss.org/t/the-end-of-tt-rss-org/7164">announced</a> that he's going to stop working on it, and will remove all infrastructure on November 1st. Forks of the project with other maintainers may pop up, but at the moment it's too soon to tell what the future of Tiny Tiny RSS will be.</p>
<h3>Lighthouse</h3>
<p><a href="https://lighthouseapp.io/">Lighthouse</a> is also a relatively new product. It's in beta, which refers to the fact that it doesn't yet have all features necessary to fulfill its vision, which goes beyond simple feed reading.</p>
<p>The main differentiator is that it focuses on articles over feeds, and has a separate view for curating articles (the inbox). It's focused on finding high-value content.</p>
<p><img alt="" blurwidth="8" blurheight="4" loading="lazy" width="1270" height="686" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Flighthouse.a4e8de60.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Flighthouse.a4e8de60.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://lighthouseapp.io/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Flighthouse.a4e8de60.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p><h2>Similar product categories</h2>
<p>Feed readers are powerful products, which require manual setup to make them work well. Subscribing to feeds is mandatory, adding tags, filtered views, and rules can make them work even better. But for some use-cases, other product categories are simpler and might work better.</p>
<h3>News aggregators</h3>
<p>News aggregators automatically collect and curate news from a large variety of sources. They usually provide some customization options, but focus on news and don't allow arbitrary feed subscriptions like feed readers do.</p>
<p>They focus on providing an overview of the most relevant news stories.</p>
<p>Examples are <a href="https://kite.kagi.com/">Kagi News,</a> <a href="https://ground.news/">Ground News</a>, and <a href="https://www.smartnews.com/">SmartNews</a>.</p>
<h3>Reading lists</h3>
<p>Reading lists, also called read-it-later apps, are for saving and organizing links you found somewhere on the web. Many feed readers can do the same, but reading lists are optimized for that purpose.</p>
<p>Examples are <a href="https://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> and <a href="https://hq.getmatter.com/">Matter</a>. <a href="https://github.com/karakeep-app/karakeep">Karakeep</a> is a self-hosted option.</p>
<h2>How to choose</h2>
<p>For most people, going with one of the hosted products is the best option. They're generally the most polished and most powerful products, owing to the fact that they have companies behind them with full-time engineers. They generally also offer a free plan, so if you stay within the limits of those, they will even be free to use.</p>
<p>For more specific requirements, products of the other categories can work better. They have different characteristics, and can work better in some situations. For example, if you want total control over your data, self-hosted options are the way to go.</p>
<p>It's probably easiest to first decide on the category, and then check out multiple products, or maybe even try them out. Virtually all products support OPML import and export, so moving feed subscriptions from one product to the next is almost zero effort.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <p>Let me test out a theory here: If you're into emulation, you're into older video games, ergo you're into <em>old stuff</em> of all kinds. That means you, savvy, good-taste-having reader, will love this spread of photos I took in Tokyo last week at the National Film Archive of Japan, which has a small but lovely set of exhibits from the history of Japanese film.

And it's coming late in the day Sunday — apologies! But patience pays off!!</p><p>This issue's main story has been cookin' for a minute: last month the news landed that MAME had finally properly cracked Hyper Neo Geo 64 support, but the celebration was a little bit premature. The arcade system was playable in MAME, yes, but sound was in really shoddy shape — it wasn't yet a particularly good experience. </p><p>Over the last month or so that's been changing, and changing fast, with frequent improvements checked in by a pair of regular MAME contributors. So <em>now</em> is the time to talk about it, and <em><strong>soon</strong> </em>(with the very next MAME release!) it will be time to actually play it. Considering there are only seven Hyper Neo Geo 64 games, well, that's a week's worth of evenings sorted.</p><p>As with every trip to Tokyo I took a few hours to stop by Akihabara this time, but its pull has certainly lessened over the years as retro prices have skyrocketed from where they were a decade ago and the selection has gotten thinner and thinner. Still, browsing the stores is a fun time and there are great finds to be found as long as you're not looking for anything too in-demand. I picked up one game: Kamiwaza, a PS2 "stealth" game where you play as a thief in feudal Japan stealing hella stuff.</p><p>As you might guess, it's more silly than stealthy.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GFLNxNU-54E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Kamiwaza PS2 Gameplay HD (PCSX2 v1.7.0)"></iframe></figure><p>Shout out to my shopping partner in crime, Paradise Killer's Oli Clarke Smith, for the recommendation. I've got a feature on the way in the coming weeks over at PC Gamer based on some of the games we picked up and how they speak to the "identity" of particular retro consoles. I'm hoping it'll be a fun read! </p><p>For now, let's hop into MAME; then stick around for an update on Pioneer LaserActive emulation!</p><div><p>💸</p><p><i><em>If you enjoy </em></i><i><b><strong>ROM</strong></b></i><i><em>, I'd love it if you'd consider </em></i><a href="https://www.readonlymemo.com/#/portal/support"><i><b><strong>a small tip</strong></b></i></a><i><em> to help me cover my monthly costs.

"When I started looking at the system back in 2004 MAME didn't really do much 3D stuff at all, even things like the MIPS (main CPU) core were in a much rougher shape, there were no dumps of the I/O MCU at all (happened only a few years ago) and the PC I had at the time barely had enough memory to load and decode even the 2D graphics," he says. </p><p>"It was also pre-YouTube, and even in the early days of YouTube you didn't really get much in the way of good reference material. Kinda crazy to think that a lot of people who are probably interested in the emulation of the platform now as younger adults weren't even born when emulation work first started on it!"</p><p>A few weeks ago, two decades after he started looking into the system, Haywood finally promoted it to "working" status in MAME. But that move was a bit of a formality, or a bit sneaky, depending on how you look at it. Though the promotion got some buzz, it wasn't truly finished: proper sound emulation was still missing. Haywood actually hadn't worked on the core since 2023, and decided, well, people had been playing the games for long enough without sound, he might as well slap the "working" label on. It turned out to be the final push other MAME contributors needed to take a crack at tuning up the sound.</p><p>What's the Hyper Neo Geo's whole deal, anyway? Well, it makes some sense that the system would be more a curiosity for younger folks to discover than an object of intense nostalgia like some of MAME's more high-profile cores or the original Neo Geo; it was only active in arcades for two years from 1997 to 1999 during the awkward transitional period to 3D, with just seven games released for it:</p><ul><li>Road's Edge</li><li>Samurai Shodown 64</li><li>Xtreme Rally</li><li>Beat Busters: Second Nightmare</li><li>Samurai Shodown 64: Warriors Rage</li><li>Fatal Fury: Wild Ambition</li><li>Buriki One</li></ul><p>Here's a nice write-up of the system from Nicole Express that delves into the hardware: </p><figure><a href="https://nicole.express/2021/ultra-mega-hyper-neo-geo-64.html?ref=readonlymemo.com"><div><p>The failed heir: The Hyper Neo Geo 64!</p><p>In 1982, Commodore International introduced the technology world to the concept of 64.

Haywood's initial investigation into it predated even MAME's high profile support of Capcom's CPS3 boards, for instance, but once that platform was decrypted support was added quite quickly because hell yeah people wanted to play Street Fighter III. By comparison, "Hyper64 has been a 21 year on-and-off slog," he says.</p><p>It's a perfect representation one of the eternal frustrations of emulation development: People often ask why no one's working on something when they actually are. Just invisibly.</p><blockquote>"The sheer number of times I picked up the Hyper64 driver and pumped weeks of work in it only to not be able to make any progress at all was frustrating at the best of times. Just trying to gain an understanding of it all, but ending up not making any headway at all.  That's something I don't think people really appreciate when it comes to emulation, the amount of time that you have to put in which often yields no positive results at all, where all you can really conclude is it doesn't work the way you were hoping it would work." </blockquote><p>A few years ago, Haywood finally made substantial progress: Someone dumped the I/O microcontroller, and he was able to write a CPU core to emulate it. "The inputs finally started working in a bunch of the games, which allowed me to explore them further and make video improvements," he said. </p><p>"Other components improving in MAME over the years has really helped too.  When I started MAME didn't have a CPU core for the V53 either (which is a V33 CPU with variolus peripherals) and is the CPU driving the sound DSP.  At some point in MAME's history the V53 support got fleshed out (for other systems) which has really come in handy now, as proper sound emulation requires that to be running properly."</p><p>When Haywood marked the platform as working, it caught the attention of another longtime MAME contributor: R. Belmont. For the last month or so, Belmont, as well as two other devs, Happy and O. Galibert, have been chipping away at making the games sound like they're supposed to. </p><p>"Haze marking them working did provide a push, and Happy had done a detailed disassembly of the sound CPU program which was quite useful," Belmont recently posted on Reddit. Belmont and Galibert have both been working on synthesizer support in MAME, and the Hyper Neo Geo 64's sound chip happens to be used it one, providing them with some convenient overlap in interest/speciality. </p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YVrXnV33cjc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Hyper NeoGeo 64 Sound Improvements for MAME 0.282 (from O.Galibert &amp; R.Belmont)"></iframe></figure><p>The current MAME release, 0.281, includes a series of rapid-fire improvements as documented by Belmont in a few videos <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKrXtzndXmw&amp;ref=readonlymemo.com" rel="noreferrer">on YouTube</a>:</p><ul><li>"Very early work in progress on better audio for the Hyper Neo Geo 64 system.  There is a loooong way to go, this is just some very basic fixes so far."</li><li>"Since the first video we've got the basic sample starts and stops working the actual correct way they're supposed to and added a preliminary support for volume envelopes, which also helps the audio balance.  Still a lot of work to go though."</li><li>"More progress today!  I figured out how the volume envelopes really work, and that made Buriki One's intro mostly awesome."</li><li>"Barring any last minute adjustments, this is what HNG64 audio will sound like in MAME 0.281. Since the last video, the per-voice low pass filter was added, which cleans up some of the high frequency 'hash' audible previously and makes the sound a bit cleaner."</li></ul><p>It was a ton of progress for a month, taking Hyper Neo Geo 64 sound support from messy and inaccurate to, at least, broadly playable without assaulting your ears. But the real refinements have been coming in just the last few days since 0.281's release in late September.</p><p>But the next build is gonna be the big one. October's upcoming MAME 0.282 release will notably fix up the audio issues in one of the the trickiest games, Xtreme Rally, while really polishing up the rest. Here's what Belmont's noted in update notes for 0.282 so far: </p><ul><li>"Olivier Galibert figured out how they squeezed 12 bits of dynamic range into 8 bits (presumably this is the format from Roger Linn's original MPC60 design) and replaced the biquad low-pass filter with a more likely Chamberlin one that fits the parameters better. Also there were some improvements to the filter envelope. All this results in much clearer and higher-fidelity sound."</li><li>"This time we've figured out how looping samples actually work, fixed the final mixdown to not introduce any distortion, and fixed the filter envelope. The result? A dramatic improvement to Beast Busters Second Nightmare's intro."</li><li>"So the previous fixes seem to have solved Samurai Shodown 64 and SS64 2, but Xtreme Rally (aka Off Beat Racer) was still extremely broken. The engine sound barely worked, sounds were missing, and some sounds would stick looping forever. This time the problem wasn't actually in the sound emulation itself; Xtreme Rally has unique code among the 7 HNG64 games that tries to push sound commands to the sound CPU as quickly as possible. This resulted in as many as 2/3rds of the commands getting dropped on the floor. I have fixed that issue so that all of the commands make it, and Xtreme Rally now sounds great."</li></ul><p>Since Belmont made that post he dialed in a few more improvements where the wrong sounds were playing in certain instances in the game. Here's a video from Haywood showing off the vastly improved audio (though he notes "some graphical issues, such as the fog in the tunnel still need addressing eventually.")</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H9P8_u6lRIA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Hyper NeoGeo 64 &quot;Xtreme Rally&quot; Sound Improvements for MAME 0.282 (from R.Belmont)"></iframe></figure><p>Once MAME 0.282 releases, the Hyper Neo Geo 64 will well and truly be worthy of the "working" label. Turns out it just needed that last little push.</p><p>In a perfect encapsulation of how these sorts of collaborative projects come together, Galibert noted on Reddit that despite their contributions to the core stemming from an interest in emulating synthesizers, "amusingly, the synth itself (MPC3000) is not working at all yet." Some parts of the synthesizer remain undumped and undocumented, just as parts of the Hyper Neo Geo once were; sometimes while you're waiting for all the pieces to fall into place, it turns out one of the pieces you do have happens to fit into another puzzle entirely.</p><p>"It's just been a long slow process," Haywood said. "Things have inched forward a little bit over the years, and the surrounding code in MAME has become better / more capable, allowing for more progress to be made, step by step."</p><hr><h3 id="2-cant-stop-pioneering-nec-support-and-big-laseractive-performance-improvements-arrive-in-the-latest-ares-nightlies">2.

It took less than three weeks. While you can grab the <a href="https://github.com/ares-emulator/ares/releases/download/nightly/ares-windows-x64.zip?ref=readonlymemo.com" rel="noreferrer">nightly build</a> anytime, when the next stable build of Ares releases, it'll be all official-like.</p><p>Considering the bulky size of the LaserActive game rips — they can take up dozens of gigabytes — some performance optimizations Nemesis has implemented <a href="https://github.com/ares-emulator/ares/pull/2241?ref=readonlymemo.com" rel="noreferrer">in the last few days</a> are almost as exciting as the second console support. Because now you should be able to run the images off a decent HDD without performance issues. Here's the breakdown on Github:</p><blockquote>"This change brings speed enhancements to LaserActive games. The linear resampling coefficient precalculation reduces overall CPU overhead by approximately 30%, making slower CPUs much more likely to achieve full framerate. Additionally, frame prefetch using a background thread makes games much more tolerant of IO latency, making it possible to play games back from platter drives over SATA3.<p>This should be sufficient to make emulation performance acceptable on 95%+ of systems, and I don't have any further optimizations planned at this stage."</p></blockquote><p>So then — LaserActive support is more or less feature complete. What can you play? What <em>should</em> you play? Seeing as the system's deader than dead and nobody's likely to be playing copyright cop, the Laserdisc rips are being freely uploaded and shared <a href="http://techdocs.exodusemulator.com/Console/PioneerLaserActive/Software.html?ref=readonlymemo.com" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.

While MCP provides the raw connection to a tool, a Gemini CLI extension takes the basic ability to use that tool and wraps it in a layer of intelligence and personalization.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post"><article><p>2025-10-08</p><section><p>10 min read</p><img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1zaMttyutjMsqHUuEpCss3/8b7eb27d92e5fc53f6541d04fe0b778f/Bug_Bounty.png" alt=""><div><p>Every second, 84 million HTTP requests are hitting Cloudflare across our fleet of data centers in 330 cities. It means that even the rarest of bugs can show up frequently. In fact, it was our scale that recently led us to discover a bug in Go's arm64 compiler which causes a race condition in the generated code.</p><p>This post breaks down how we first encountered the bug, investigated it, and ultimately drove to the root cause.</p>
    <p>
      <h2 id="investigating-a-strange-panic">Investigating a strange panic</h2>
      
    </p>
    <p>We run a service in our network which configures the kernel to handle traffic for some products like <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/network-services/products/magic-transit/"><u>Magic Transit</u></a> and <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/network-services/products/magic-wan/"><u>Magic WAN</u></a>. Our monitoring watches this closely, and it started to observe very sporadic panics on arm64 machines.</p><p>We first saw one with a fatal error stating that <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/c0ee2fd4e309ef0b8f4ab6f4860e2626c8e00802/src/runtime/traceback.go#L566"><u>traceback did not unwind completely</u></a>. That error suggests that invariants were violated when traversing the stack, likely because of stack corruption. After a brief investigation we decided that it was probably rare stack memory corruption. This was a largely idle control plane service where unplanned restarts have negligible impact, and so we felt that following up was not a priority unless it kept happening.</p><p>And then it kept happening.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
      <h4 id="coredumps-per-hour">Coredumps per hour</h4>

          <img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7ohMD2ph3I9l7lbZQWZ4xl/243e679d8293565fc6a55a670c9f3583/BLOG-2906_2.png" alt="BLOG-2906 2" width="1999" height="526" loading="lazy">
          </figure><p>When we first saw this bug we saw that the fatal errors correlated with recovered panics. These were caused by some old code which used panic/recover as error handling.&nbsp;</p><p>At this point, our theory was:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><p>All of the fatal panics happen within stack unwinding.</p></li><li><p>We correlated an increased volume of recovered panics with these fatal panics.</p></li><li><p>Recovering a panic unwinds goroutine stacks to call deferred functions.</p></li><li><p>A related <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/73259"><u>Go issue (#73259)</u></a> reported an arm64 stack unwinding crash.</p></li><li><p>Let’s stop using panic/recover for error handling and wait out the upstream fix?</p></li></ol><p>So we did that and watched as fatal panics stopped occurring as the release rolled out. Fatal panics gone, our theoretical mitigation seemed to work, and this was no longer our problem. We subscribed to the upstream issue so we could update when it was resolved and put it out of our minds.</p><p>But, this turned out to be a much stranger bug than expected. Putting it out of our minds was premature as the same class of fatal panics came back at a much higher rate. A month later, we were seeing up to 30 daily fatal panics with no real discernible cause; while that might account for only one machine a day in less than 10% of our data centers, we found it concerning that we didn’t understand the cause. The first thing we checked was the number of recovered panics, to match our previous pattern, but there were none. More interestingly, we could not correlate this increased rate of fatal panics with anything. A release? Infrastructure changes? The position of Mars? </p><p>At this point we felt like we needed to dive deeper to better understand the root cause. Pattern matching and hoping was clearly insufficient.&nbsp;</p><p>We saw two classes of this bug -- a crash while accessing invalid memory and an explicitly checked fatal error.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Now we could observe some clear patterns. Both errors occur when unwinding the stack in <code>(*unwinder).next</code>. In one case we saw an intentional<a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/b3251514531123d7fd007682389bce7428d159a0/src/runtime/traceback.go#L566"> <u>fatal error</u></a> as the runtime identified that unwinding could not complete and the stack was in a bad state. In the other case there was a direct memory access error that happened while trying to unwind the stack. The segfault was discussed in the <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/73259#issuecomment-2786818812"><u>GitHub issue</u></a> and a Go engineer identified it as dereference of a go scheduler struct, <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/924fe98902cdebf20825ab5d1e4edfc0fed2966f/src/runtime/runtime2.go#L536"><u>m</u></a>, when<a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/b3251514531123d7fd007682389bce7428d159a0/src/runtime/traceback.go#L458"> <u>unwinding</u></a>.&nbsp;  </p>

      <h3 id="a-review-of-go-scheduler-structs">A review of Go scheduler structs</h3>
      
    </p>
    <p>Go uses a lightweight userspace scheduler to manage concurrency. Many goroutines are scheduled on a smaller number of kernel threads – this is often referred to as M:N scheduling. Any individual goroutine can be scheduled on any kernel thread. The scheduler has three core types – <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/924fe98902cdebf20825ab5d1e4edfc0fed2966f/src/runtime/runtime2.go#L394"><code><u>g</u></code></a>&nbsp; (the goroutine), <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/924fe98902cdebf20825ab5d1e4edfc0fed2966f/src/runtime/runtime2.go#L536"><code><u>m</u></code></a> (the kernel thread, or “machine”), and <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/924fe98902cdebf20825ab5d1e4edfc0fed2966f/src/runtime/runtime2.go#L644"><code><u>p</u></code></a> (the physical execution context, or&nbsp; “processor”). For a goroutine to be scheduled a free <code>m</code> must acquire a free <code>p</code>, which will execute a g. Each <code>g</code> contains a field for its m if it is currently running, otherwise it will be <b>nil</b>. This is all the context needed for this post but the <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/runtime/HACKING.md#gs-ms-ps"><u>go runtime docs</u></a> explore this more comprehensively.&nbsp;</p><p>At this point we can start to make inferences on what’s happening: the program crashes because we try to unwind a goroutine stack which is invalid. In the first backtrace, if a <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/b3251514531123d7fd007682389bce7428d159a0/src/runtime/traceback.go#L446"><u>return address is null, we call </u><code><u>finishInternal</u></code><u> and abort because the stack was not fully unwound</u></a>. The segmentation fault case in the second backtrace is a bit more interesting: if instead the return address is non-zero but not a function then the unwinder code assumes that the goroutine is currently running. It'll then dereference m and fault by accessing <code>m.incgo</code> (the offset of <code>incgo</code> into <code>struct m</code> is 0x118, the faulting memory access). </p><p>What, then, is causing this corruption? The traces were difficult to get anything useful from – our service has hundreds if not thousands of active goroutines. It was fairly clear from the beginning that the panic was remote from the actual bug. The crashes were all observed while unwinding the stack and if this were an issue any time the stack was unwound on arm64 we would be seeing it in many more services. We felt pretty confident that the stack unwinding was happening correctly but on an invalid stack.&nbsp;</p><p>Our investigation stalled for a while at this point – making guesses, testing guesses, trying to infer if the panic rate went up or down, or if nothing changed. There was <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/73259"><u>a known issue</u></a> on Go’s GitHub issue tracker which matched our symptoms almost exactly, but what they discussed was mostly what we already knew. At some point when looking through the linked stack traces we realized that their crash referenced an old version of a library that we were also using – Go Netlink.</p>

            <p>We spot-checked a few stack traces and confirmed the presence of this Netlink library. Querying our logs showed that not only did we share a library – every single segmentation fault we observed had happened while preempting<a href="https://github.com/vishvananda/netlink/blob/e1e260214862392fb28ff72c9b11adc84df73e2c/nl/nl_linux.go#L880"> <code><u>NetlinkSocket.Receive</u></code></a>.</p>

      <h3 id="whats-async-preemption">What’s (async) preemption?</h3>
      
    </p>
    <p>In the prehistoric era of Go (&lt;=1.13) the runtime was cooperatively scheduled. A goroutine would run until it decided it was ready to yield to the scheduler – usually due to explicit calls to <code>runtime.Gosched()</code> or injected yield points at function calls/IO operations. Since<a href="https://go.dev/doc/go1.14#runtime"> <u>Go 1.14</u></a> the runtime instead does async preemption. The Go runtime has a thread <code>sysmon</code> which tracks the runtime of goroutines and will preempt any that run for longer than 10ms (at time of writing). It does this by sending <code>SIGURG</code> to the OS thread and in the signal handler will modify the program counter and stack to mimic a call to <code>asyncPreempt</code>.</p><p>At this point we had two broad theories:</p><ul><li><p>This is a Go Netlink bug – likely due to <code>unsafe.Pointer</code> usage which invoked undefined behavior but is only actually broken on arm64</p></li><li><p>This is a Go runtime bug and we're only triggering it in <code>NetlinkSocket.Receive</code> for some reason</p></li></ul><p>After finding the same bug publicly reported upstream, we were feeling confident this was caused by a Go runtime bug. However, upon seeing that both issues implicated the same function, we felt more skeptical – notably the Go Netlink library uses unsafe.Pointer so memory corruption was a plausible explanation even if we didn't understand why.</p><p>After an unsuccessful code audit we had hit a wall. The crashes were rare and remote from the root cause. Maybe these crashes were caused by a runtime bug, maybe they were caused by a Go Netlink bug. It seemed clear that there was something wrong with this area of the code, but code auditing wasn’t going anywhere. </p>
    <p>
      <h2 id="breakthrough">Breakthrough</h2>
      
    </p>
    <p>At this point we had a fairly good understanding of what was crashing but very little understanding of <b>why</b> it was happening. It was clear that the root cause of the stack unwinder crashing was remote from the actual crash, and that it had to do with <code>(*NetlinkSocket).Receive</code>, but why? We were able to capture a <b>coredump</b> of a production crash and view it in a debugger. The backtrace confirmed what we already knew – that there was a segmentation fault when unwinding a stack. The crux of the issue revealed itself when we looked at the goroutine which had been preempted while calling <code>(*NetlinkSocket).Receive</code>.&nbsp;    </p>

            <p>The goroutine was paused between two opcodes in the function epilogue. Since the process of unwinding a stack relies on the stack frame being in a consistent state, it felt immediately suspicious that we preempted in the middle of adjusting the stack pointer. The goroutine had been paused at 0x555577cb2880, between<code> ADD $80, RSP, RSP and ADD $(16&lt;&lt;12), RSP, RSP</code>.&nbsp;</p><p>We queried the service logs to confirm our theory. This wasn’t isolated – the majority of stack traces showed that this same opcode was preempted. This was no longer a weird production crash we couldn’t reproduce. A crash happened when the Go runtime preempted between these two stack pointer adjustments. We had our smoking gun.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>At this point we felt pretty confident that this was actually just a runtime bug and it should be reproducible in an isolated environment without any dependencies. The theory at this point was:</p><ol><li><p>Stack unwinding is triggered by garbage collection</p></li><li><p>Async preemption between a split stack pointer adjustment causes a crash</p></li><li><p>What if we make a function which splits the adjustment and then call it in a loop?</p></li></ol>

            <p>This function ends up with a stack frame slightly larger than can be represented in 16 bits, and so on arm64 the Go compiler will split the stack pointer adjustment into two opcodes.

            <p>A reproducible crash with standard library only? This felt like conclusive evidence that our problem was a runtime bug.</p><p>This was an extremely particular reproducer! Even now with a good understanding of the bug and its fix, some of the behavior is still puzzling. It's a one-instruction race condition, so it’s unsurprising that small changes could have large impact. For example, this reproducer was originally written and tested on Go 1.23.4, but did not crash when compiled with 1.23.9 (the version in production), even though we could objdump the binary and see the split ADD still present! We don’t have a definite explanation for this behavior – even with the bug present there remain a few unknown variables which affect the likelihood of hitting the race condition.&nbsp;</p>

    </p>
    <p>arm64 is a fixed-length 4-byte instruction set architecture. This has a lot of implications on codegen but most relevant to this bug is the fact that immediate length is limited.<a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0596/2020-12/Base-Instructions/ADD--immediate---Add--immediate--"> <code><u>add</u></code></a> gets a 12-bit immediate,<a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/dui0802/a/A64-General-Instructions/MOV--wide-immediate-"> <code><u>mov</u></code></a> gets a 16-bit immediate, etc. How does the architecture handle this when the operands don't fit? It depends – <code>ADD</code> in particular reserves a bit for "shift left by 12" so any 24 bit addition can be decomposed into two opcodes. Other instructions are decomposed similarly, or just require loading an immediate into a register first.&nbsp;</p><p>The very last step of the Go compiler before emitting machine code involves transforming the program into <code>obj.Prog</code> structs. It's a very low level intermediate representation (IR) that mostly serves to be translated into machine code.&nbsp;</p>
            <pre><code>//https://github.com/golang/go/blob/fa2bb342d7b0024440d996c2d6d6778b7a5e0247/src/cmd/internal/obj/arm64/obj7.go#L856

// Pop stack frame.
// ADD $framesize, RSP, RSP
p = obj.Appendp(p, c.newprog)
p.As = AADD
p.From.Type = obj.TYPE_CONST
p.From.Offset = int64(c.autosize)
p.To.Type = obj.TYPE_REG
p.To.Reg = REGSP
p.Spadj = -c.autosize
</code></pre>
            <p>Notably, this IR is not aware of immediate length limitations. Instead, this happens in<a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/2f653a5a9e9112ff64f1392ff6e1d404aaf23e8c/src/cmd/internal/obj/arm64/asm7.go"> <u>asm7.go</u></a> when Go's internal intermediate representation is translated into arm64 machine code. The assembler will classify an immediate in <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/2f653a5a9e9112ff64f1392ff6e1d404aaf23e8c/src/cmd/internal/obj/arm64/asm7.go#L1905"><u>conclass</u></a> based on bit size and then use that when emitting instructions – extra if needed.</p><p>The Go assembler uses a combination of (<code>mov, add</code>) opcodes for some adds that fit in 16-bit immediates, and prefers (<code>add, add + lsl 12</code>) opcodes for 16-bit+ immediates.&nbsp;  </p><p>Compare a stack of (slightly larger than) <code>1&lt;&lt;15</code>:</p>
            <pre><code>; //go:noinline
; func big_stack() byte {
; 	var big_stack = make([]byte, 1&lt;&lt;15)
; 	return big_stack[0]
; }
MOVD $32776, R27
ADD R27, RSP, R29
MOVD $32784, R27
ADD R27, RSP, RSP

</code></pre>
            <p>With a stack of <code>1&lt;&lt;16</code>:</p>
            <pre><code>; //go:noinline

; 	var big_stack = make([]byte, 1&lt;&lt;16)

ADD $8, RSP, R29
ADD $(16&lt;&lt;12), R29, R29
ADD $16, RSP, RSP
ADD $(16&lt;&lt;12), RSP, RSP
RET
</code></pre>
            <p>In the larger stack case, there is a point between <code>ADD x, RSP, RSP</code> opcodes where the stack pointer is not pointing to the tip of a stack frame. We thought at first that this was a matter of memory corruption – that in handling async preemption the runtime would push a function call on the stack and corrupt the middle of the stack. However, this goroutine is already in the function epilogue – any data we corrupt is actively in the process of being thrown away. What's the issue then?  </p><p>The Go runtime often needs to <b>unwind</b> the stack, which means walking backwards through the chain of function calls. For example: garbage collection uses it to find live references on the stack, panicking relies on it to evaluate <code>defer</code> functions, and generating stack traces needs to print the call stack. For this to work the stack pointer <b>must be accurate during unwinding</b> because of how golang dereferences sp to determine the calling function. If the stack pointer is partially modified, the unwinder will look for the calling function in the middle of the stack. The underlying data is meaningless when interpreted as directions to a parent stack frame and then the runtime will likely crash.&nbsp;</p>
            <pre><code>//https://github.com/golang/go/blob/66536242fce34787230c42078a7bbd373ef8dcb0/src/runtime/traceback.go#L373

if innermost &amp;&amp; frame.sp &lt; frame.fp || frame.lr == 0 {
    lrPtr = frame.sp
    frame.lr = *(*uintptr)(unsafe.Pointer(lrPtr))
}
</code></pre>
            <p>When async preemption happens it will push a function call onto the stack but the parent stack frame is no longer correct because sp was only partially adjusted when the preemption happened. The crash flow looks something like this:  </p><ol><li><p>Async preemption happens between the two opcodes that <code>add x, rsp</code> expands to</p></li><li><p>Garbage collection triggers stack unwinding (to check for heap object liveness)</p></li><li><p>The unwinder starts traversing the stack of the problematic goroutine and correctly unwinds up to the problematic function</p></li><li><p>The unwinder dereferences <code>sp</code> to determine the parent function</p></li><li><p>Almost certainly the data behind <code>sp</code> is not a function</p></li><li><p>Crash</p></li></ol>

            <p>Once we discovered the root cause we reported it with a reproducer and the bug was quickly fixed. This bug is fixed in <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/commit/e8794e650e05fad07a33fb6e3266a9e677d13fa8"><u>go1.23.12</u></a>, <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/commit/6e1c4529e4e00ab58572deceab74cc4057e6f0b6"><u>go1.24.6</u></a>, and <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/commit/f7cc61e7d7f77521e073137c6045ba73f66ef902"><u>go1.25.0</u></a>. Previously, the go compiler emitted a single <code>add x, rsp</code> instruction and relied on the assembler to split immediates into multiple opcodes as necessary. After this change, stacks larger than 1&lt;&lt;12 will build the offset in a temporary register and then add that to <code>rsp</code> in a single, indivisible opcode. A goroutine can be preempted before or after the stack pointer modification, but never during. This means that the stack pointer is always valid and there is no race condition.</p>

<p>Coming just hours before the partial shutdown of Federal government operations, this hearing was sparsely attended, even by members of the committee, and got little press attention. The hearing opened with the Chair and Ranking Minority Member of the committee talking over each other at length.</p>
<p>Much of the argument between Senators and the questioning of witnesses focused not on the general problems of the <a href="https://papersplease.org/wp/2018/07/29/federal-air-marshals-blow-the-whistle-on-tsa-quiet-skies-traveler-surveillance-program/">Quiet Skies</a> traveler surveillance program program or government travel <a href="https://papersplease.org/wp/2021/01/19/put-them-on-the-no-fly-list/">blacklists</a> (referred to euphemistically as “watchlists” throughout the hearing) but on whether these programs have been weaponized to a greater extent under Democratic or Republican administrations.</p>
<p>But if we — and, we hope, members of Congress — can look past the partisan polemics, the <a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/hearings/examining-the-weaponization-of-the-quiet-skies-program/">testimony</a> and <a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025.09.30_Final-Hearing-Documents.pdf">documents introduced into the record</a> of this hearing provide important guidance on what can and should be done to protect <strong>all</strong> travelers —&nbsp; regardless of our party affiliation (if any), ethnicity, religious beliefs, or political opinions — against the weaponization of travel blacklists by <em>whatever</em> government is in power.<span id="more-20425"></span></p>
<p>The <a href="https://papersplease.org/wp/2018/07/29/federal-air-marshals-blow-the-whistle-on-tsa-quiet-skies-traveler-surveillance-program/">Quiet Skies</a> [sic] program assigned officers from the <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/videos/inside-look-federal-air-marshal-service">Federal Air Marshals Service</a> (one of the police agencies within the Transportation Security Administration) to accompany and surveil pre-selected airline passengers on flights and in airports.</p>
<p>Quiet Skies is just one of many travel surveillance and blacklisting programs. According to another report by the same Senate committee last yea (under a chair from the opposite side of the aisle), “There are at least 22 different mechanisms that might lead Americans to receive additional screening at airports and other ports of entry or be denied the ability to travel.”</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://papersplease.org/wp/2018/07/29/federal-air-marshals-blow-the-whistle-on-tsa-quiet-skies-traveler-surveillance-program/">precious whistleblower reports</a> and <a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025.09.30_Final-Hearing-Documents.pdf">documents obtained by the Senate HSGAC Committee</a> and entered into the record of the hearing last week, Quite Skies targets were selected by a ruleset that incorporated other US government <a href="https://papersplease.org/wp/2021/01/19/put-them-on-the-no-fly-list/">blacklists</a> and <a href="https://papersplease.org/wp/2018/08/31/a-broader-legal-challenge-to-federal-blacklists/">watchlists </a>as well as profile-based rules that factored in ethnicity and countries previously visited.</p>

<p>The Quiet Skies program was <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/06/05/secretary-noem-ends-politicized-tsa-watchlist-program-has-failed-prevent-single">ended in June 2025</a> by the Secretary of Homeland Security, Kristi Noehm.&nbsp; The same day as the Senate hearing on Quiet Skies last week, the TSA&nbsp; <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/news/press/releases/2025/09/30/dhs-and-tsa-expose-targeting-political-opponents-former-biden">announced</a> that Secretary Noehm was firing five senior TSA officials associated with the Quite Skies program, including the TSA’s executive assistant administrator for operations support and the deputy assistant administrator for intelligence and analysis.</p>
<p>News reports, presumably based on DHS statements, described Quiet Skies as a “<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-removes-senior-leaders-over-airline-passenger-watch-list-screening-program-2025-09-30/">Biden-era</a>” program even though <a href="https://papersplease.org/wp/2018/07/29/federal-air-marshals-blow-the-whistle-on-tsa-quiet-skies-traveler-surveillance-program/">its largest expansion came in 2018</a>&nbsp; during the first Trump administration. And according to the TSA’s <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/news/press/releases/2025/09/30/dhs-and-tsa-expose-targeting-political-opponents-former-biden">press release</a> last week:</p>
<blockquote><p>The TSA administrator has legal authority to prevent an individual from boarding an aircraft, task Federal Air Marshals with surveilling an individual, or place them on a watchlist, but it is only intended to be used to track and prevent dangerous criminals and terrorists from carrying out attacks on Americans.</p></blockquote>
<p>We question whether the TSA Administrator has the authority to prevent someone from traveling by common carrier without getting an order from a judge.&nbsp; And the TSA and DHS have consistently asserted authority and exercised power — legally or not — to blacklist and surveil travelers without needing any suspicion of criminality.</p>
<p>The bipartisanship of violations of the right to travel through blacklisting and watchlisting was brought out in the response of <a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/Testimony-Ayoub-2025-09-30.pdf">Mr. Abed Ayoub</a>, Executive Director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) to one of the Senators’ questions about the weaponization of watchlists and blacklists against disfavored groups and individuals:</p>
<blockquote><p>That’s not a partisan problem. That’s a due process problem. When the government can quietly tag one group, it can quietly tag any group, left, right, neither, just depending on who holds power. The answer is the same for all of us: end the watchlists….</p>
<p>Quiet Skies captures only part of the story. It’s a window into a faulty surveillance architecture. The watchlist isn’t about who you vote for. It’s about whether the government has to prove its case when it takes away your rights….</p>
<p>Our community, for the past quarter of a century, we’re… targeted by all the administrations, so we can tell you the experience under Republican and Democratic administrations.</p></blockquote>
<p>Further guidance about what Congress can and should do was provided by another of the witnesses, <a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/Testimony-Harper-2025-09-30-Final.pdf">Mr. Jim Harper</a>, a Senior Nonresident Fellow of&nbsp; the American Enterprise Institute:</p>
<blockquote><p>We intuitively feel we have the right to travel, and there are cases from the Supreme Court that say you have a right to travel: You can move from one state to another and they can’t deny you Welfare benefits when you get there.</p>
<p>There are other cases: <a href="https://papersplease.org/gilmore/">A man in San Francisco wanted to fly to Washington, DC, to meet with his Representative</a>,&nbsp; and the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals <a href="https://papersplease.org/wp/2023/06/12/tsa-misstates-the-case-law-on-id-to-fly/">said</a> that you don’t have a right to travel on your preferred mode of transportation. They said, no, you can take the train, you can drive, if you want to go to Washington, DC.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://papersplease.org/wp/2021/11/22/freedom-to-travel-act-of-2021-introduced-in-congress/">clear right to travel</a> — Americans believe they have it, but the courts haven’t accorded it to them — would give them a position when they went to court.</p></blockquote>
<p>Court cases challenging the <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/4365955/fikre-v-federal-bureau-of-investigation">no-fly list</a> (ongoing since 2013, and now on remand following a <a href="https://papersplease.org/wp/2024/03/19/unanimous-supreme-court-rules-that-no-fly-case-can-go-forward/">unanimous favorable Supreme Court decision</a> in 2024) and <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/7653937/parties/jardaneh-v-barr/">other travel blacklists and watchlists</a> (ongoing <a href="https://papersplease.org/wp/2018/08/31/a-broader-legal-challenge-to-federal-blacklists/">since 2018</a>) have been dragged out for years by the government. The government continues to claim that “merely” being delayed for a few hours or days isn’t sufficiently harmful to a traveler’s rights to provide a basis for a lawsuit.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://papersplease.org/wp/2021/11/22/freedom-to-travel-act-of-2021-introduced-in-congress/">Freedom to Travel Act</a> that was introduced in 2021 in the House of Representatives would provide both an explicit statutory right to travel by common carrier and a cause of action for violations of that right by government agencies, carriers, or other entities.</p>
<p>We hope Senators and Representatives moved to act on the issues raised in last week’s hearing on the TSA will re-introduce and co-sponsor the <a href="https://papersplease.org/wp/2021/11/22/freedom-to-travel-act-of-2021-introduced-in-congress/">Freedom to Travel Act</a> in this session of Congress, hold committee hearings on it, and incorporate it into appropriate omnibus legislation that has a better chance of passage than a standalone bill.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main" itemprop="articleBody"><p><strong>Author's Note:</strong> Before we begin, an important clarification. What follows is a horror story based on real events from my career. However, to protect the privacy of the people and companies involved, I have deliberately mixed things up: technologies, contexts, and specific details have been modified or merged with other experiences. I therefore invite you to read this story not as a strict chronicle of a single event, but as an archetype of a widespread problem in the IT world: vendor lock-in and predatory business practices. Any attempt to identify the specific company or software described would lead to an incorrect conclusion.</p><hr><p>When the phone rang, I was in a meeting - so I didn’t answer. But I recognized the number and sent a quick message: </p><blockquote><p>"I’m with a client right now. If it’s not urgent, please send me an email - otherwise I’ll call you ASAP".</p></blockquote><p>The reply, via SMS, left me speechless: </p><blockquote><p>"That’s exactly the problem. I can’t send you an email. Call me as soon as you can".</p></blockquote><p>From that moment on, my perception of a certain kind of world changed forever.</p><hr><p>A few years earlier, a major public institution - let’s call it <em>Agency A</em> - was still running an ancient Exchange mail server. It hadn’t received security updates for ages, the anti-spam was completely ineffective, and the new regulations were clear: embrace Open Source solutions whenever possible.</p><p>They had already received a proposal - expensive but seemingly reasonable - for a managed service, hosted by an external provider, built on an open source mail stack. The company offered a managed version with its own proprietary additions and enterprise support. The catch? The price was absurd, and <em>Agency A</em> already had solid infrastructure - reputable IP classes, redundant datacenters, everything working fine. We had built and maintained that environment for years, and it was still running perfectly.</p><p>The request was simple: <em>“Evaluate this solution, and if it’s suitable, we’ll migrate.”</em>. About 500 active mailboxes, roughly the same number of aliases. Manageable, but far from trivial.</p><p>So I started experimenting. I had heard of that stack before but never used it directly. I deployed it in some non-critical environments - ours, and a few test clients who agreed to try it at a discounted rate. Everything worked flawlessly for almost a year. I began to appreciate its design and flexibility. Confident, I told <em>Agency A</em> we could proceed with a pilot migration.</p><p>We built a new server, deployed the stack, and assigned a few secondary domains for early adopters. The feedback was great - so good that users started pushing for a full migration.<br> The IT team planned carefully: created accounts and aliases, migrated selected mailboxes, and kept the old Exchange server online (hidden, for legacy access).</p><p>The morning after the MX switch I was tense, waiting for trouble - but it never came. A couple of small questions, nothing serious. The internal team handled everything perfectly. It was a success.</p><hr><p>Word spread quickly.</p><p><em>Agency B</em> - smaller, but in some ways more influential - contacted me. They were customers of the same managed-service company that had pitched to <em>Agency A</em>. Once they saw the potential savings (at less than a tenth of the annual cost), the stability, and the freedom of keeping their data on their own servers, they became very interested. Their contract, however, was a five-year deal with automatic renewal - two years left. The legal office said the notice period was six months, so there was time.</p><p>They wanted to prepare silently. Their supplier was known for <em>aggressive commercial behavior</em> and often retaliated when customers tried to leave. So we built everything quietly - users, aliases, test setups - and froze the system, waiting for the official termination notice.</p><p>That day finally came. The notice was sent, about eight months before expiration. Migration would begin upon confirmation of receipt - or the following month at the latest.</p><p>Meanwhile, I learned that <em>Agency C</em> - another institution - was also planning to leave the same provider. They wanted to keep the same software stack for consistency, so I told them about our experience. They asked for a quote, which I prepared (without mentioning <em>Agency B</em>, of course). My margin would have been small, but the project made sense: it was about <em>owning your data</em>, not making money.</p><p>Everything seemed to move smoothly - until that SMS.</p><hr><p>I called back immediately.</p><blockquote><p>"There’s been a problem with the termination" said the IT manager of <em>Agency B</em>.<br> "Somehow they found out what we were doing. There are hidden clauses we didn’t know about, and now we can’t leave - at least not for another five years. They know everything. Even your quote.".</p></blockquote><p>I was stunned. How could they possibly know?</p><p>Minutes later, my phone rang again - <em>Agency C</em> this time. </p><blockquote><p>"Forget the proposal", they said. "They called us. Threatened us, actually. They even mentioned your name and said they might take legal action against you for unfair competition - claiming they’re the only <em>‘authorized’</em> installers of that software. Which is absurd, of course. It’s open source. But our director doesn’t want trouble.".</p></blockquote><p>Sometimes, when public money is involved, people prefer avoiding troubles over doing what’s right.</p><hr><p>Something didn’t add up.<br> Then someone at <em>Agency C</em> noticed a clue: a former interim IT manager still had an email client connected via token authentication - with access to all messages. And that person had signed the original contract with the provider years before. Informally questioned, he admitted contacting them "to warn them" but claimed it was harmless. He never mentioned me - supposedly.</p><p>That still didn’t explain how they knew about <em>Agency B</em>’s internal steps. To test a theory, we set a trap: I asked a friend abroad to send <em>Agency B</em> a fake quote, from a company outside the EU.<br> The following Monday, the provider called <em>Agency B</em> and said, "We advise against working with non-EU companies - compliance can get tricky.".</p><p>That strongly suggested it: <strong>it looked as if they might have been reading the emails.</strong></p><p>The IT manager exploded and confronted them. The response was chilling: </p><blockquote><p>"I’m not saying we do - but we could. It’s in the contract. You should read the fine print, especially the unilateral amendment from two years ago.".</p></blockquote><p>That amendment, quietly accepted, included horrifying clauses:<br> - notice period extended from 6 to 12 months<br> - formerly free services could become paid at the provider’s discretion<br> - and, "for security reasons", they could disable any access other than the webmail - which they promptly did.</p><p>All of this happened before the GDPR era, when certain practices could still slip through.</p><hr><p>I tried to contact the company’s owner directly - no reply. Calls, emails, nothing. Their support lines were "not authorized to forward requests". I wanted to confront them about the <em>“not accredited”</em> nonsense and the so-called <em>unfair competition</em>. But bullies never like a fair conversation.</p><p>I urged <em>Agency B</em> and <em>C</em> to investigate - not only legally, but ethically.<br> They were horrified, yes - but in the end, nothing changed.<br> Worse: the provider, invoking that same contract amendment, made previously free features paid ones, increasing their costs by another 30%.<br> Management wasn’t outraged by the abuse - just by the extra expense, "hard to justify in the budget".</p><hr><p>Years later, those directors were gone. The technical staff remained - older, wiser, and determined not to repeat the mistake. They eventually switched providers, though to something "safer", not necessarily better.</p><p>I couldn’t solve that problem. The battle had to come from them, and I would have supported them all the way - not for profit, but for principle.<br> Because when a company that claims to <em>“support open source”</em> behaves like that, we all lose.<br> We all get labeled the same way.</p><p>And that’s the real horror of the story - not the software, but what people do with it.</p></div></div>]]></description>
